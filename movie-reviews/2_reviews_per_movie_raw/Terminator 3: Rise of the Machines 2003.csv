"Quantom-X","8","69","76","3 October 2018"," Really underrated.
","I feel this movie gets a lot more hate than it deserves. Sure it may not be as good as the second one, and let's face it it's hard to top T2. But that doesn't make this a bad film. I actually like how John Connor is portrayed in this. Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.<br/><br/>And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!"
"RoxanneAndorfer","8","63","73","6 July 2003"," The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.
","I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum.  However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt.  At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.<br/><br/>Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7).  The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.<br/><br/>The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place.  It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans.  Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the ""Reluctant Hero"" theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be.  John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero.  True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless.  She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.<br/><br/>That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character.  He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel.  If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection.  Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient.  In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!"
"MR_Heraclius","7","42","50","6 March 2020"," Rise of the Machines
","With no James Cameron involved what so ever with this project. The whole shift of the franchise turned from this film onwards. The biggest problem with this film is the humour, it is cringe to watch, pretty much all the humour falls flat throughout the film. The film also looked like they didn't know what to with the story itself. Arnold's performance looks off a bit, (it was he last big film before he became governor). John Connor is this film is so bad to watch, all he does is complain and it will get on people nerves. The effects are no where as great as T2. Saying that, there are like couple of decent action set pieces, but it doesn't help the movie."
"asgrrr","8","14","15","22 November 2019"," Not a Bad Third Album
","I'm a Terminator fan. T2 is a high water mark in action film making that few will ever reach. This movie, Terminator 3:Rise of the machines, is worth some money seeing. It was never going to match T2, let's be realistic. But it's anything but terrible. There's female injection, but there had to be some to make up for Sarah Connor, it's not a problem. The first half is sufficiently interesting, and the action is sufficiently exciting, but not much more. The plot is well set up, regarding John Connor's situation. Now, I don't want to spoil, but the ending really - REALLY - hits home. Incredibly powerful.<br/><br/>All in all, this film moves along from the position of T2, and delivers everything sufficiently well, or even a lot better than that. A worthy third instalment.<br/><br/>P.S. isn't it interesting that T3 and Dark Fate score about the same but T3 has mostly positive reviews but D.F. has mostly terrible reviews? Just a thought."
"desertfox1942-178-876030","9","36","43","17 November 2019"," Still hating this movie after Dark Fate?
","I liked it when I saw it as a 13 year old boy and I still like it as an adult. Yes, it's not better than T2. No one expected it to be. And yet it has a coherent story that is the logical continuation of the second movie. I hope that more Terminator fans will now appreciate it after the recent awful sequels like Genisys (with the spelling error) and Dark Fate which destroyed the franchise.
And as much as some people want to hate this movie, at least it didn't fail at the box office.
By the way, Kristanna Loken is an impressive terminator. Roast me."
"Superunknovvn","6","324","445","9 May 2004"," Good, but not worthy of the Terminator franchise (including nerdy rant & SPOILERS)
","I know it's easy to put ""Terminator 3"" down. Everybody had great expectations and it was clear that this movie would have lots of enemies, especially if someone else than Cameron was going to direct. So, here it is now, T3, and the truth is, it is a good action movie, just not as good as Terminator 1 & 2.<br/><br/>What I liked best about this movie is that it doesn't include any martial arts. Since ""The Matrix"" came out, I often wondered if it would even be possible to make an action movie without Kung Fu anymore. Also, Mostow really tried to not only focus on the action but include some story and character development, too. The problem is, the story is nowhere near as good as it used to be. The writers mistook character development for endless whiney monologues by John Connor, supposed leader of mankind. Where Cameron always found the right balance between someone explaining what was going on and action scenes, T3 fell into the trap of slowing down too often.<br/><br/>What's bothering me even more, is that writers really had a lot of chances to turn Â„Terminator 3"" into an interesting story that picked up from the end of T2. I hoped that finally we'd get an explanation for why only one Terminator is sent back at a time, how the time portal works, how CyberDyne recreated the information on future technology after it had been destroyed in part 2, etc. Instead writers gave vague or no hints at all to previous riddles and went away too far from the original ideas of Â„Terminator"". Â„No fate but what we make for ourselves"" we were told in parts 1 & 2. Now it has changed to Â„Judgement Day is inevitable"". Why is that, you may ask yourself and why would a Terminator know that? It's only one of many things that don't really make sense. A fact that's even more annoying when you think about how perfect the series has been so far. Sure, James Cameron had also made mistakes (John's and Sarah's age, for instance) but the main story did always make sense.<br/><br/>Mostow obviously was afraid of stepping into Cameron's shoes and be compared to him, so he decided to put several nods to the previous movies in sequel no. 2. Nice thought, but T3 is definitely too much of a Â„nod"" to T1 & T2. It's part parody, part rip-off that has only few new elements. Again there are two Terminators, one brand new, one obsolete, we get a spectacular car chase, desert scenes, etc. Furthermore, we get a funny version of the bar scene at the beginning and a Â„funny"" cameo by infamous psychiatrist Dr. Silberman. Yes, some of the jokes are actually quite funny, but really, why would the Terminator smash the gay glasses? Come on, this is supposed to be a serious movie! The worst thing about all this repeating old stuff is that this time there's no suspense whatsoever. It just feels like we've seen it before and we know exactly what's coming.<br/><br/>One scene that could have brought a cool twist to the movie was the one where Arnold gets reprogrammed by the T-X. It would have been so cool, if the T-800 had turned into the bad guy again now. It would have showed that a machine knows no loyalty. Instead we got the most stupid scene ever in a Â„Terminator"" movie: John Connor asks the T-800 not to kill him and the Terminator obeys. Reese said in part 1 Â„It can't be bargained with"" and now John did just that. Sad. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. And what's with John Connor? Isn't he the one who will go on to lead mankind? In T3, he isn't much of a leader to me. Is it the writers fault or Nick Stahl's, I don't know, but the character is such a sissy in this movie, it's painful.<br/><br/>About the T-X: why the hell isn't that thing bigger, stronger, faster? The T-X has no real improvements compared to the T-1000 and it seems to be really stupid. How else could it lose to the trashy T-800? And why did it change back to its known form just before it could have killed Kate Brewster in the disguise of her fiancÃ©. Why would it walk around with the same face all the time, anyway? (Granted, that's a question that T2 had already raised and not answered) Although Kristinna Loken played her part quite well, I think it was a bad decision to have a woman play the T-X in the first place. How cool is it to watch Big Ol' Arnold beat up a girl? There are so many more minor mistakes in this movie it gives me headaches (why was the T-800 already programmed to not kill innocent people and look for the keys in the car when it was a different Terminator than the one in part 2? If Arnie is not programmed to answer John's questions why did he answer when John asked if he was gonna kill him? Why did the T-X investigate the place where Kate Brewster works at night? Why didn't the T-X try to reprogram the T-800 from the beginning? Why has the Terminator never used the little atom bomb chip, he's carrying within, against an enemy?), but I think I better stop here.<br/><br/>However, I did like the ending a lot as it's the only real improvement to the whole story and an open door for a sequel. ""Terminator 3"" is still the best action movie of this summer and it feels really good to see Arnie back in action one more (last?) time."
"harbingerofapocalypse","8","73","94","7 July 2015"," Why the Hate?
","I truly don't get the hate for this movie, unless you're one of those types that goes to comicon and asks questions about insanely obscure trivia to flaunt your vast knowledge of the T universe or writes erotic terminator fan-fiction from your mom's basement. <br/><br/>It's the least of the three terminators, yes. But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. <br/><br/>It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it."
"capricornius","8","36","44","15 November 2018"," It doesn't deserve the hate
","This movie doesn't deserve the hate it's getting. Now obviously it isn't as good as the first two Terminator movies. But this is also what's ""wrong"" with it. It's a great movie, but if you compare it to 1 and 2 then of course it won't be great, simply because the two first just are that great and legendary movies.
But - as I wrote - it certainly doesn't deserve the hate.

","When I saw the movie the first time, after I watched the first terminator and T2 I wasn't really disappointed by it. It was a good decent movie with a really terrifying terminator and a good plot with interesting new approach to future sequels. I would understand why at the time of the release it was considered a bad followup BUT after I watched the sequels including ""dark fate"", this movie is a masterpiece and probably the last decent terminator movie to date. In my opinion if you wanna see this movie franchise don't go further than this movie. Even if this movie ends in a sad ending, the sequels are even sadderðŸ˜¢."
"HHoffman-2","7","106","149","19 August 2006"," A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.<br/><br/>Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.<br/><br/>The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.<br/><br/>Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.<br/><br/>And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.<br/><br/>Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.<br/><br/>Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.<br/><br/>My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.<br/><br/>Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. <br/><br/>However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.<br/><br/>I happen to love it."
"axlrhodes","6","161","241","2 June 2008"," Unwanted parody of two of cinemas finest action films
","No matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films."
"mtillett-202-316442","10","9","10","4 February 2020"," You should watch it again: in 2020
","I'm 39 years old, and have seen each installment as it is theatrically released. The 1st time I saw T3 I was 23, and enjoyed it very much: way before Fans took over IMDB to play Siskel & Ebert (and become so judgemental of anything not signed by Cameron). I even went to buy the Playstation game which is a blast to play.
Having seen all the sequels by now, I revisited T3 today: and as the closing credits started I felt compelled to write this review. Yes, it's not a Cameron original, but Mostow gave his best: what is there not to like of the chase scene with the crane, which goes without any music until Arnold takes over the fire truck? Intense! Arnold could not have done a better job (powerful and funny as in T2); Nick and Claire are as good and emotional as any scared humans running through the saga; And Kristanna is as vicious as any other Terminator (plus super sexy... thanks to Adriana Lima! I didn't get this joke the 1st time around). Spoiler Alert: if you don't think the best moment of the saga is to see John respond to the 1st stress calls and become Leader of the Resistance... You obviously don't treasure Origin Stories. And this one is way before Batman Begins or Joker (which are masterpieces)."

","Having watched the original Terminator, its sequel T2: Judgment Day and T3: Rise of the Machines at 7/8 (and T2 being my all-time favourite movie!), i will always feel nostalgia when rewatching this one. while the first 2 are helmed as classics in the sci-fi and action genres, T3 and its 3 successors Salvation, Genisys and Dark Fate bring up many debates between Terminator fans.<br/><br/>after having destroyed Cyberdyne's research in T2, John Connor lives off the grid in the year 2004. a new model Terminator designated the T-X is sent from the year 2032 to find and terminate as many of his future Resistance lieutenants as possible, including his future wife Kate Brewster. unfortunately for John the T-X locates him, being its primary target. John and Kate are rescued by an updated T-800 - the T-850. now they must evade the T-X and stop Judgment Day once again.<br/><br/>T3 is far better than most people give it credit for. many people site this movie's portrayal of John as one of the main problems - but it only makes sense that John is portrayed as angst-ridden and not as confident as his T2 counterpart, having been told his whole life that he will become the leader of the Resistance, but not happening yet.<br/><br/>my only main gripes with this movie are the lack of blue hue James Cameron used in the first 2 films, and minor continuity errors (John saying he was 13 when the T-1000 attacked him, despite T2 clearly showing that he was 10. John saying Cyberdyne was destroyed ""over 10 years ago"", despite T2 taking place in June 1995 and T3 taking place in July 2004. several DVDs and IMDb say that John is 22/23/25, although taking place in 2004 makes John 19).<br/><br/>while i would have loved to see Linda Hamilton back as Sarah Connor in this movie, it's never really bothered me all that much. give T3 a chance, it really isn't as bad as people make it out to be. for me it's on par with last year's Terminator: Dark Fate, although for me T3 gets me so full of nostalgia that i'll always see it as my third favourite in the franchise! for me T3 gets a 8.5/10! give it a chance!"
"kjamestriplett","8","5","5","18 December 2019"," A surprising, satisfying, solid follow up to Terminator 2!
","I was very impressed with Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines. Yes, it does seem more like a comedy than a serious action movie, but at least the comedy wasn't awful. Here's a little known fact to everyone hating saying it doesn't match up to Terminator 2: Judgement Day: No Terminator movie ever could or will. Although the film does stay true and reverent to what Terminator 2 did. And yes, I have watched Salvation and Genisys, and I humbly agree that they were disappointing. I haven't seen Dark Fate but I'm not going to. Nick Stahl was a great adult John Connor. Now yes, he's no Edward Furlong, but nonetheless, he's one of the coolest and greatest to ever portray him compared to Christian Bale (Who was an awful John Connor now) and Jason Clarke. I heard many complaints were that he was whiny, and of course he is. John always was. He has a destiny he doesn't want, and never did, even when he was a boy. He literally has the weight of the world upon his shoulders. The T-X is a very interesting change in villainy, and Arnold makes a worthy return although it doesn't take much for him to make a good return after playing the character greatly twice before. Under the circumstances the director had of continuing Cameron's legacy, it was probably the best it could get. I loved how the film stayed true to the mechanics of science like when the fire mixed with sand made glass, and how the future is inevitable. I do realize the films ending is probably depressing to a lot of people but it was probably the only sensible ending for it to remain true to what T2 did. It was to me, at least. Not to mention it's the only Terminator sequel that I think is reverent and respectful to what T2 was about, whereas with some other sequels, (Genisys, Dark Fate) you had them defeat the whole purpose about what T1 and T2 was about. Some future events are inevitable, and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it, and how no one can ever really change their destiny, which was always decided. The film is still as cool as Terminator 1&2, with a couple of scenes that stay reverent to some classic scenes from the originals like the Terminator with the machine guns against the cop cars, the classic lines as well as some other classic lines introduced. I was not at all disappointed, and I expected to be. Will definitely revisit and screw the other sequels."
"view_and_review","8","129","206","30 January 2007"," T3 is a solid follow up to a classic
","T3 was actually very good. Put it this way, if we had never been treated to the classic and innovative T2, I believe a lot more people would have been in love with T3. T3 was looking at some serious obstacles: 1.) following up T2, a monster success 2.) an aging Arnold Schwarzenegger 3.) making a cohesive story that wouldn't contradict the former Terminators 4.) making a better terminator than the T-1000.<br/><br/>As I said before, they followed up T2 respectably enough. There were good fight scenes with the T-800 and the T-X (I particularly like the fight in the bathroom), and there was an excellent car chase scene near the beginning. The action was good and plentiful, the effects were nice, and there was some good humor in the movie as well.<br/><br/>Arnold was still in shape enough and made up enough to be believable. Of course he wore the leather jacket the entire movie. Not only that, he was an older Terminator model anyway, so any signs of stiffness or slow wittedness could easily be blamed on that.<br/><br/>The story flowed well. John Connor (Nick Stahl) was again the focus except he is now a bit more subdued and scared. In his attempts to stay out of any electronic systems, he chooses a horrible life of joblessness, homelessness, and just plain bumming it. He was complimented by a much smarter, cleaner, and stronger partner, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes); she was tied into the story rather well. They stayed true to the Armageddon type story line and even had a bit of misdirection at the end to make the movie even more interesting.<br/><br/>The T-X model terminator (Kristanna Loken) was nice. Sure, they chose a beautiful woman for the T-X, but she was not to be trifled with. The T-X had the same shape shifting abilities as her predecessor (the T-1000) but she also had abilities to control anything that had a CPU and she could form her hand into a variety of weapons. Similar to the T-1000 (Robert Patrick of T2), the T-X (Loken) took the T-800 (Schwarzenegger) to town, but she was a bit more dangerous even than the T-1000.<br/><br/>T3 was a solid movie for a third installment. Usually by the third sequel you are begging Hollywood to stop, but I can't say that about this movie. This movie is good enough to watch more than once."

"Tweekums","8","12","15","16 November 2017"," A decent third instalment that is full of action
","It is ten years since the events of Terminator 2; Judgement Day did not take place and John Connor is a drifter rather than the saviour of humanity. At least that is what he thinks; as a virus plagues the internet the military plans to use Skynet to fight itÂ… soon two terminators will show up. The first is a new T-X model, this looks like a woman and is programmed to kill those destined to be John's lieutenants. The second is a T-850, the familiar model payed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, which has been programmed to ensure John survives Judgement Day. By coincidence John meets up with Kate Brewster, a girl he last saw the day before the events of the last film and destined to be an important part of his future, just as the T-X comes to kill her and the T-850 arrives to save him. They manage to escape but the T-X is never far behind and Kate takes some persuading to accept what is going on. Kate's father is the Air force officer who will release Skynet; John believes that they can get to him and stop Judgement Day again; the T-800 states that Judgement Day is inevitable.<br/><br/>After a great original film and an impressive sequel this film has a lot to live up to so I can understand why plenty of Terminator fans aren't keen on this instalment. It isn't as good as the previous films but I still really enjoyed it. John Connor is no longer a smart Alec teen and his mother Sarah has died; the first detail is good news but the second is a pity as Sarah Connor was such a great character. Arnie's T-850 is much the same as he was in T2; which is good and I really liked the new T-X model terminator even if it seemed to break some of the rules established in previous films with her built in weapons. The action is almost non-stop with plenty of really impressive set pieces; most notably when the T-X chases her targets in a massive crane wreaking havoc along the way. Nick Stahl did a fine job as the slightly jaded Connor and Claire Danes impressed as Kate; I also liked Kristanna Loken's portrayal of T-X and as for ArnieÂ… well he is The Terminator so no complaints there. Overall an enjoyable addition to the franchise."

","When I first heard that James Cameron wasn't going to be involved with the third installment to this fantastic series, I was less than pleased.  The thought of another director taking over the franchise kind of upset me, I just had to hope that they would find a director that could fill those rather large shoes.  I later heard that Jonathan Mostow was named director of T3 and was pleased due to being VERY impressed with both of his previous directorial efforts, ""Breakdown"" and ""U-571"", but of course I was still skeptical.<br/><br/>So the film was finally released and of course I went and saw it opening weekend.  Let me tell you I was NOT let down!  I thought the film was truly fantastic!  I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me and I'm sure plenty might even get upset with me, but I thought ""Terminator 3"" was just as good as both previous installments of the series.  They all had their pros and they all had their cons.<br/><br/>I was at first a little uneasy with the idea of a female terminator.  But, after seeing the film and thinking about I've come to the conclusion that having a female terminator if a brilliant idea.  What would have an easier time infiltrating just about anything?  A gorgeous and sexy woman or a large intimidating man?  The woman, definitely!  Besides, Jonathan Mostow did such a fantastic job with the T-X that it just worked perfectly.<br/><br/>The special effects in the film are truly amazing, looking even better than the effects in T2.  There were VERY few times where I thought it looked like obvious CG.  There is one scene in the first few minutes of the film that show a slew of Terminators walking around doing what they do that nearly brought tears to my eyes, it looked so awesome!  I won't get into the specifics, but the special effects are reason enough to see this film.<br/><br/>The actors all did a fantastic job.  I thought Nick Stahl was an excellent replacement for Edward Furlong.  When I first heard Nick was taking over the role I didn't think he looked the part, but he really pulled it off.  In fact, in the end, I'm happier that Nick took over the role rather than Edward Furlong continuing his role, because I really don't think Edward looks the part anymore, he was fine as the young John Connor, but I don't think he'd work well as the John Connor of this film.  Claire Danes did a fantastic job as well, she pulled off a great job in the film and looks as beautiful as ever.  Kristanna Loken plays the part of the T-X very well, looking sexy as can be and doing a great job with her facial expressions and her limited dialogue.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for her future work.  Then of course, there's the great Arnold Schwarzenegger, reprising his role as The Terminator (T-800/T-101).  Arnold, again was excellent as the Terminator and didn't let me down.  There is also a very nice cameo by Earl Boen, the only other actor to reprise a role from the first two installments in the Terminator series.  Despite having very little screen time, he did a great job and I was very happy to see him in the film.<br/><br/>Personally I thought the story in this film was great and very well thought out.  There are a few things that may have been overlooked or improperly explained, but nonetheless, this is a movie we're talking about here and there are bound to be a few plot holes, so I didn't let those little things affect my enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>The only thing I would complain about if I had to, is some of the humor in the film.  I won't deny that the jokes were funny, but I thought some were a little misplaced, this is, after all an R-rated sci-fi/action film.  There were only really two or three comedic moments that I thought should have been excised from the film, but otherwise I thought everything worked pretty well.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that liked the previous Terminator films.  I would hope that you can enjoy this for what it is and not what James Cameron MIGHT have done had he directed the film.  Just because Cameron opted not to direct the film does not mean it's a bad film. Don't get hung up on the fact that Cameron didn't direct it, just sit back and enjoy the ride.  Thanks for reading my review, and be sure to check out my reviews for both previous films: ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""."

"BA_Harrison","8","91","147","3 December 2007"," Introducing the T-X.
","Schwarzeneggar is back (he said he would be) as another T-1000 cyborg sent through time to protect the now grown up John Connor (Nick Stahl), and his future wife, Kate (Claire Danes), who are being stalked by the T-X (Kristanna Loken), the latest in murderous machines hellbent on destroying the human race.<br/><br/>Rise Of The Machines might not be the (near) perfect juggernaut of an action sequel that was Cameron's Judgement Day, but as far as edge-of-the-seat, sci-fi fun goes, it's still bloody good! Director Jonathan Mostow certainly makes the most of his mega-budget, and delivers plenty of jaw-dropping mayhem along with loads of impressive special effects. And Schwarzenneggar does what he does best: blowing things up, shooting huge weapons, and delivering cheesy one-liners.<br/><br/>The (mostly) smart script follows on nicely from The Terminator and T2, further developing the character of John Connor, neatly explaining away the absence of Linda Hamilton in a not-too-disappointing way, and brilliantly bringing the whole affair to a satisfying, and not altogether happy, conclusion. There is blistering action (a set piece involving a massive crane causing untold damage to umpteen cars and buildings is absolutely incredible), some nice touches of humour, and a bit of quite gruesome violence (for a DVD that is rated 12!).<br/><br/>Sure, T3 isn't quite as good as its predecessors, but how many films are? Both the original The Terminator and T2 are extremely tough acts to follow. I think Rise Of The Machines does a pretty good job and deserves a lot more praise than it gets."

","I did not expect so much after the announced names of the producers Kassar and Vajna; I also did not know anything about the director Jonathan Mostow. But I must confess that even though I still prefer the first Terminator, I very liked the third one. First I read the announcement of the T3 with a female terminator around 10 years ago in a magazine, so I was looking forward to it long time. Today I watched it (my first Terminator movie in cinema), and I declare all the staff made a good work. Ms. Kristanna Loken was so the good choice!"
"mjbspace","4","259","452","21 July 2003"," Who cares!
","Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!<br/><br/>Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.<br/><br/>
While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.<br/><br/>Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.<br/><br/>Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.<br/><br/>
Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks ""now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up"" or ""let's try this - it might be funny"". <br/><br/>This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! <br/><br/>Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of ""who cares!"" <br/><br/>The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. <br/><br/>Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!"
"Terryfan","8","16","22","8 October 2015"," Still a good Terminator film
","Say what you want about Terminator 3 Rise Of The Machines I still a strong film in the Terminator films yes I still will call the first two masterpieces and it should have not with just Terminator 2 but of course a series like the Terminator it is gonna be made into sequels. <br/><br/>Also I'll take Terminator 3 over Terminator Salvation any day. Here's why. <br/><br/>The plot in some ways feels like a ""What if"" Storyline as The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is send back through time to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) from T-X (Kristanna Loken).<br/><br/>The film features some extreme action stunts that have you on the edge and it goes to show that the film did a lot to make it feel like Terminator and the fights were pretty intense for this one.<br/><br/>The score in the film is pretty strong where the music helps the story of the film.<br/><br/>There is a good bit of humor in this film but it don't take away from what the film from what it suppose to be. <br/><br/>The special effects are pretty impressive with attention to make them look believable. Yes I know this movie gets a bad rap but if you're a fan of Terminator you should at least give it a shot and it is must better than Terminator Salvation<br/><br/>I give Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines an 8 out of 10"
"scottand","9","4","4","31 January 2020"," I have always liked this installment.
","I appreciate this sequel even more after watching the last three Terminator sequels which were all awful and forgettable, especially Dark Fate. I wasn't expecting much from Terminator 3 since most sequels go downhill fast and the second sequel usually scrapes the bottom of the barrel but the chase scene near the beginning was a truly bracing experience that made me sit up and take notice.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that the Terminator was a female in this one. I have always liked seeing woman in action flicks doing things that we are used to seeing men do. Also, having a female Terminator followed the logic of Terminator 2 where subsequent Terminators were more streamlined and elegant and yet more powerful than the big and bulky Terminator of the first movie.<br/><br/>I am probably one of the few people, if not the only one, who likes T3 more than T2. I appreciate that in T3 the Terminator's mimicking abilities were not taken to the almost comical extent that they were in T2 where in one scene the T1000 liquefied and morphed into a black and white checkerboard floor. That was a bit much for me. I also liked that they began to flesh out the story to explain how the machines ended up taking over. In all, I think this was the LAST decent Terminator movie."

Unsure why this film gets so much hate. Of course it's not as good as the first two but it's far far better than Terminator Genisys ......that is a truly terrible film. I havent seen Dark Fate yet so cant comment. But give this film another chance and you'll see it's actually a great film."
"bob the moo","Null","92","157","1 September 2003"," Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable film
","In 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job.  He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him.  In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster.  Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them.  As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.<br/><br/>T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out.  In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters.  In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not.  However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.<br/><br/>The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor.  Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene.  However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.<br/><br/>The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc.  I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy.  The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology.  The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!<br/><br/>The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all.  Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it.  For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good.  In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.<br/><br/>The cast is roundly good.  The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well.  Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else.  Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.<br/><br/>Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do.  The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time.  The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending.  I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch.  Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this."
"El Gato-4","1","121","215","14 March 2005"," Waste of time
","Even if there were no Terminator or T2, T3 would be a horridly mediocre movie. The original Terminator was an exercise in imagination conquering budget limitations, while T2 showed what could be accomplished if imagination were wedded to an unlimited budget. T3 shows what a tremendous budget with little imagination gets you - a terminator whose unique ability is to make her fingers into sharp points. Whoopee! There are narrative lapses too numerous to mention, such as our non-tech hero operating an atom smasher. Or a heroine who doesn't know exactly what her father does for a living traipsing into the super secret underground & armored military installation where he works. T3 operates best as a self-administered IQ test: if you thought this movie was good, you should seriously consider remedial education."

","The Terminator is a character idolized by thousands of people around the world. The imagery - along with unconscious symbols - made this character an icon for generations.<br/><br/> Jim Cameron ingenuity (with the help of Bill Wisher) gave us two movies that complement each other, folding the story in ways ever more interesting each time you watch them.<br/><br/> Action packed, fun and original. We helped spread the word on Terminator mythology.<br/><br/> How come a movie studio using their rights to use a character build up such a opportunity-jackpot-halfbaked popcorn movie just to make cash out of loyalty of this huge fan base?<br/><br/> I felt betrayed and sad when I saw this (God permits) last installment on this sequel. What have they done to my robot?<br/><br/> What did they do with my movie?"
"arkanis50","8","73","126","18 August 2003"," A reasonably fitting end to the series, or a vision of things to come?
","Terminator 3 was nothing short of a thrill-ride of explosions, over-the-top action and fun - although after three movies I am finding the Terminator series getting very repetitive. Is it just me, or does it seem like a member of the resistance comes back to protect John Connor/Sarah Connor, the machines send back a Terminator to take them out - we see some fights and bingo-bango, a couple hours later it is all resolved?<br/><br/>I felt Terminator 3 lacked the look and feel of the classic Terminator 2, and often bordered on unintentionally comical scenes. I had to laugh at some of the fight scenes between The Terminator and the T-X, which seemed like some sort of CGI bad dream. On the opposite side of the coin, the scenes throughout the movie which were supposed to be comical, felt very cheesy and tacked-on, i.e. the Elton John glasses.<br/><br/>That aside, Terminator 3 was packed full of what Arnie movies do best - fights, chases and s*** getting blown up. The car chase scene involving the crane was great, and as far as I am concerned was better than The Matrix Reloaded's attempt at a car chase any day. The T-X, played by very cute Kristanna Loken, brought a freshness to her role as the 'Anti-Terminator' Terminator. The T-X seems to take the best of the Terminator and the T-1000, and chucks in some extra firepower for added effectiveness.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 might not add as much to the overall story as possibly Terminator 2, but it will fill a lot of holes, expand on some of the concepts hinted at in previous movies and tie up some loose ends in the series. You will learn more about John Connor's future, Skynet, Judgement Day, and the future of mankind's battle against the machines.<br/><br/>As for the ending? Well I thought it was a very interesting and thought-provoking way to end the movie, and possibly the series. Although given Hollywood, I would imagine there will probably be at least one or two more movies. With or without Arnold, the series surely must move away from the ""send back a Terminator to kill John, and they send one to protect him"" style, and take us to the future where John Connor takes control of the resistance.<br/><br/>I give T3 an 8/10."
"Nuuu","1","73","126","6 July 2003"," To think: I'm criticizing Arnold for showing TOO MUCH emotion
","Poor writing and poor directing plagued this film.  The characters simply weren't who they were supposed to be.<br/><br/>John Connor (Nick Stahl) who was trained in weapons and warfare from childhood by his mother dealt unflinchingly with the threat of the T-1000 as a 13 year old boy now appears to be a scared and confused drifter who freezes under pressure and exudes none of the confidence or ingenuity he did a decade ago.<br/><br/>The T-X (Kristanna Loken) is cartoony.  In place of ruthless efficiency for which the terminators are known she kills sadistically.  Rather then relentlessly pursuing her enemy she seems to saunter and pose in what I can only assume is an attempt to build suspense.   And in the end, she simply isn't that frightening of a villain.<br/><br/>Arnold was the biggest disappointment if only because he played the role with far too much of a human feel.  He has emotional conversations with John Connor, appears angry and surprised at times, and has a number of one-liners during action sequences that require far more wit than a machine with no emotion should be capable of.<br/><br/>The sound was absurd.  When the terminator or the T-X was hit with something heavy we were greeted by a cartoony ""boink"" rather than something realistic. The soundtrack also lacked all of the attitude and intensity that truly set the atmosphere for the first two movies.<br/><br/>*spoilers*<br/><br/>And the continuity errors and unanswered questions ruined any hope of a story the movie may have had<br/><br/>Terminator 2 tells us that terminators (at least stock terminators) can't learn.  Arnie clearly does, after learning and reciting the ""talk to the hand"" phrase.<br/><br/>Terminator 1 tells us that The Terminators were only sent back to kill John as a last ditch effort once the resistance had destroyed the skynet core. Now, Skynet doesn't have a core at all.<br/><br/>Why would the US government leave a secret, high grade fallout shelter COMPLETELY unguarded?<br/><br/>How did John, Kate, and a 6 foot tall terminator in black leather make it to the command center of a busy high tech military research facility without authorization and while carrying loaded weapons?  And why isn't anyone surprised to see them there until shooting starts?<br/><br/>While the T-X can control machines, how can she remotely move the gear shift of a car from park to drive, an action that requires physical interaction?<br/><br/>If, as T2 suggests, the concept of skynet was only made possible by the discovery of the pieces of the destroyed terminator from T1, how was it possible in T3 after John Connor destroyed all remnants of the terminators sent back through time?<br/><br/>Unfortunately I could go on and on from here.  From the final product it appears as though the writers spent less time on the script for this movie than I did on this review"
"len-21","9","8","10","30 January 2004"," 9 on a scale of 10
","I really have no complaints about this movie. I had been wanting to see it for quite awhile and finally rented it on CD. I liked it at least as well as the others. Probably more. I've been in the mood for action lately. Action starved. Too many Beaches movies. And, this movie has action. In fact, I remember several times thinking that I couldn't look away even for a moment afraid of what I would miss. That's the definition of action in my book.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of action movies, it wasn't just mindless mayhem. Each individual scene had a point --- in addition to the mindless mayhem. I even liked the plot quite a bit. Logical. And, I love movies that mess with the time line as long as it makes sense.<br/><br/>The other nice thing about T-3 is that it set us up for T-4, T-5, etc. I don't know exactly how Arnold is going to do it since by the time he gets out of politics, he won't look anywhere near as chiseled and it will be hard to believe he is the best the robots have to offer. I would still like to see him have a role, but since robots don't age, it might be tough.<br/><br/>All in all, excellent mayhem of the first-rate mindless variety."

","It's been too long.  But Arnold seems have only aged in his face.  He still is The Terminator all the way!  I enjoyed this film and greatly appreciated its ending.  That's all i'm sayin'.  See if you like Arnold Schwarzenagger as the Terminator alone; if you will.<br/><br/>BUT see it for the hot new terminator, as well.  She did very well.  Some say her performance was too mechanical.  Um... hello???  'Nuff said there, i think.  She's very beautiful and cold looking at the same time.  Though she's a lot smaller than Arnold; she appears as a formidable foe to the ""obsolete"" T101 model.  Let's just say The Terminator had his hands full with this pint-sized beauty AND beast - The TX (Terminatrix).<br/><br/>The actor playing John Connor delivered a very believable performance and didn't seem nervous next to the great Arnold; and yet he wasn't trying to over-act to compensate, either.  The two worked well together if maybe slightly less a father-and-son combo as the John Connor in T2.  Still, very well done!<br/><br/>The 'other' girl in the flick was good, too.  I know i know her from somewhere, but she did just fine for the character she was and again didn't try to over-do it, at all.  You do feel sympathy for her and times and yet see why she becomes what she becomes in a post-judgment day world.<br/><br/>All in all, i gave it 8 out of 10.

The opening showing the war is really cool for an opening.<br/><br/>I like John in this film like the idea of him being of the grid and in hiding because he is scared of the future and dosent want Judgement Day to happen.
I also really like the idea of Judgement Day being inevitable.<br/><br/>The ending is great with Judgement Day happening and they get John save it was a good twist to end on and really turned the original stories on their heads with Judgment Day always destined to happen and John becoming the leader.<br/><br/>Some fun actions scenes the main problem I have is the story is not as good as the first two movies and some of the cgi is noticeable.
I also dont like that they killed Sarah Conner of between movies it's such a shame she wasn't in this one.<br/><br/>Still a fun action and a very underrated sequel in the Terminator series.<br/><br/>Verdict 8/10 fun movie with great action and a cool twist ending not as good or as iconic as the first two movie's but very underrated in my opinion."
"classicsoncall","8","6","7","2 March 2016"," ""They tried to murder me before I was born.""
","The main problem I have with the films in the Terminator franchise is that they couldn't possibly happen given the time travel element involved. In this picture, Arnold's T-101 tells John Connor (Nick Stahl) that he'll see him again one day even as he's being destroyed by the T-X. OK, how? See what I mean.<br/><br/>But I love the terminology. The T-X (Kristanna Loken) can control other machines, driven by a plasma reactor and carrying on board weapons with nanotechnological transistors designed to terminate other cybernetic organisms like the T-101. So it's an anti-Terminator, Terminator. How can you not love that analysis? <br/><br/>I also got a bit of a kick out of Connor's use of a little Captain Kirk type logic when he reminded the T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenneger) of his mission to protect Kate (Claire Danes) and himself, after being corrupted by the T-X. That was kind of a weak argument to be using given the premise of the T-X in the first place, but I guess the film makers needed a little wiggle room for the story to pan out.<br/><br/>So like the Terminator flicks that went before, this one appeals to me the most at the action and special effects level. The best was the T-X doing the complete 180 with her body, almost erotic in the execution if I must say. I know the T-X was supposed to be a potent killing machine, but it probably wouldn't have hurt if after one of her rampages she might have cracked a polymimetic smile."
"antoinecatry","7","6","7","30 July 2015"," Underrated
","How not surprising I have just discovered the division among fans about this movie while browsing the reviews. I feel the duty to give an opinion in lights of recent viewings : 1) the latest installment in movie theatre 2) the TV series I didn't know, which seems to me quite interesting in some aspects. Agree with most of you : a superfluous sequel, much resemblances in terms of structure with T2. Don't agree : the comedic elements are what makes the difference, they are not lame. Some of you say it's unwanted parody, that I just don't know, I believe it might be intentional : the appearance in the Chippendale spot, the inflatable TX breast, the dialogs ; my favorite is certainly this one T 800 : your confusion is not rational, she's a healthy female of breeding age. John Connor: well, you know, there's more to it than this. T 800: My database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair bondings. Arnold Schwarzenegger has always been considered, in my opinion, capable of ""self mockery"" way before other actors of his kind (Chuck Norris was forced to develop this when his agents made him aware of his commercial impact on fans, I believe), he shows a bit of his self parodic humor potential when quoting himself from Commando (I lied). So, according to these few elements, plus the beauty of Claire Danes, much cuter in red I believe, and Kristanna Loken, I pronounce this film not so bad and worthy of redemption in the eyes of purist fans. The last one, Genisys, was acclaimed in France by most papers (most of them having lost their Independence and only paid to encourage disposable culture consumption), they say it is able to make us forget T3 oh God, we must not have seen the same film. Genisys is full of inconsistencies (the saga is itself a bit hard to follow for the rational mind), complexities, senilities, devoid of fun and drama effects, and there is not a single sound from the Brad Fiedel theme. In my memory, back in 1991 on the big screen, the score was a major source of pleasure and dramatic credibility in T2 ; Bear Mc Creary redeveloped this music for the TV series, which is pretty successful to me, though inessential as well. Inessential also would be for me to review what I think of each films of the saga, the thing is I have not been able to feel the slightest ounce of pleasure since T3, and some of the series episodes. T3 is to be rediscovered in spite of its inferiority to the films of the conceptor."

I rarely like sequels except for The Empire Strikes Back. I did have a WTF moment in T3 because it did start to get lame for about 15 minutes around the 20 minute mark. I thought I would be turning it off, but I was so wrong. The funny parts were the strip club, especially the dancer, and some of Arnold's quotes. I especially liked the fact they decided to make a female Terminator. In most movies Hollywood seems to portray females as damsels in distress. That is type casting and it is old and so wrong, that's why I hate Hollywood sometimes. They need a dose of reality sometimes. This is the third installment of the franchise and I thought it was good. Even though Nick Stahl played John Conner I thought he was great. I loved the storyline, and the ending was a surprise. If you liked T1 & T2 you should like 3. It is a movie you will either like or hate, but regardless of what some say this is a great follow up"

","In musical terms T-3 would be the 'difficult' third album, the one that perhaps didn't need to made, or was over-produced and over-hyped. Think 'Be Here Now' by British band Oasis, following in the footsteps of two hugely critically and commercially successful albums.<br/><br/>The first two films in this franchise really set the bar high, the first a low budget cult classic, and the second an overblown but ultimately superb blockbuster action movie. But T-3 is a flawed project. First and foremost there was no James Cameron, meaning Mostow got the job instead. Coming from U-571, in which history is changed so that the Americans found the enigma machine instead. Not a good omen. With Cameron's films there is a focus and seriousness that is hugely appealing. 'The Terminator' is completely straight-edged and 'T-2' for all the one liners is serious when it needs to be. I don't get that with this film. From the moment the TX's chest expands it feels silly, at times a little gratuitous. What I liked about the original and it's sequel was how cold and efficient the Terminators were when it came to the killing. In 'T-3' the deaths are over the top and pointlessly visceral. Why would the TX choose to saw a victim to death rather than just shoot or stab them? Surely that would save valuable time and attract less attention? For me the TX is a real shame in this picture. A female Terminator could have chilling, more terrifying than Arnie or Robert Patrick. But for some reason it just doesn't work, she's just not cunning, or relentless enough. The T-1000 remains far more intimidating in my book. My other concern is with John Connor. Okay so Ed Furlong was a little annoying in 'T-2' but at least he had had some heart, a spark and an initiative. I could perceive him as a leader because he had some BALLS. Nick Stahl just doesn't have that. John Connor is too pathetic, too resigned to things to be the hero he'll turn into. I understand maybe Mostow felt he needed to explore Connor a little, but it doesn't work.<br/><br/>It's not all bad though, in fact far from it. 'T-3' has much to commend it. As you'd expect the special effects are good, and the action is fast paced and good to watch. The chase scenes are not as good as in 'T-2' but hey, it's hard to climb Everest twice. In particular Claire Danes is great as Caroline Brewster. Her resourcefulness and spirit despite not having a clue what's going on are hugely refreshing when placed next Nick Stahl's Connor. And of course who can forget Arnie? The big man delivers enough solid display as a character it's hard not to like. Arnie also delivers maybe the best line in the series so far 'what I what is irrelevant, I am a machine!' which I think is a fantastic line.<br/><br/>My favourite part of the movie though, is the end. No i'm not being sarcastic. The ending scene at Crystal Peak is inspired, a wonderful ending to the film. Wheras 'The Terminator' and 'T-2' needed happyish endings, 'T-3' needed the opposite. The notion that John Connor and Caroline Brewster were only meant to survive, not change the course of history is a far better concept than having them stop Skynet again. Obviously it's leading into a sequel, and it's a fine way to do it. The ending to me is the only time the whole film really captures the spirit of the original, in which survival was everything.<br/><br/>'T-3' is a good film, but it's not a great film and as such will always suffer unfavourable comparisons. Viewed objectively at times it's very good, but it doesn't do the serious stuff as well as 'The Terminator' or the action as well as 'T-2'. As a film it's quite good, but as a sequel it ultimately doesn't stack up."

"exterminator_99","6","43","76","26 November 2004"," Arnie's last stand
","Following James Cameron's original in this series, few could have projected Arnold Schwarzenegger's rise to Hollywood legend. The first film was a low-budget, B-grade (in theme and style only; the story was superb) sci-fi actioner. Arnie may have gone on to star in ill-advised yet somewhat bearable comedies, and the budget for ""T2: Judgment Day"" may have been among the biggest at the time, but at heart, Arnie was always a B-grade action movie actor. Films like ""Raw Deal"", ""Total Recall"", ""Commando"" and ""Predator"" reinforce his B-grade credentials. And as the final film in his career, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is the fitting B-grade send-off for the most popular action star of the last twenty years.<br/><br/>Fans will be familiar enough with the story; a cyborg is sent back through time from a post-apocalyptic future where man fights machines for his very existence. The cyborg's mission is to destroy, or terminate, the leader of the human resistance, a certain John Connor. Of course, the human resistance sends back its own defence for the protection of Connor, first as a human solider to protect John's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) in ""The Terminator"" (1984), then as a reprogrammed Terminator that bears an exact resemblance to the original cyborg, famously played by Schwarzenegger. Now, some 12 years after ""T2"", Arnie is sent back again, this time to protect a twenty-something John Connor (played by Nick Stahl) and a woman, Catherine Brewster (Claire Danes). After the failure of Arnie's T-800 in the original film, Robert Patrick's T-1000 in ""T2"", the machines decide on sending back a female cyborg, the T-X, played by newcomer Kristanna Loken. <br/><br/>""Terminator 3"" starts as each other film in the series, with the two cyborgs entering earth nude and seeking out appropriate clothing. Thereafter it's a hunt to find Connor and Brewster first, and many cars, buildings and people are destroyed in the process. A stunning action set-piece, and without question the action highlight of the film, involves a crane on a truck driven by the T-X disecting a row of shops, all the time with the T-800 hanging on for dear life. This is the part of the film where the action transcends its B-movie confines. Generally however, the film sticks to being B-grade. What makes it B-grade? It's the lack of grandiosity, the almost claustrophobic nature of the sets, the lack of a huge cast and the cheap(ish) special effects. This is not a James Cameron movie, and although director Jonathan Mostow tries hard, he lacks that grand canvas approach that has made Cameron's films so successful.<br/><br/>While the story may be familiar, it takes a turn when we discover that Brewster's father is the man responsible for the managing of Skynet, the computer programme that subsequently launches attacks against man. This subplot is the best narrative transition from the first two films, which essentially were exactly the same. In fact, the subplot itself delivers a surprising and highly effective twist at the conclusion of the film. You can't help but think that this would have been the best way to end ""T2"", rather than the schmoltzy goodbyes between the Terminator and John Connor (then played by Edward Furlong).<br/><br/>Furlong's absence from this film, while not perfect for continuity reasons, is not a major factor. Stahl plays Connor with immediacy and power and while he cannot always project the mood of a man with the world's future on his shoulders, he does work well with Schwarzenegger and Danes. She herself is really only working on autopilot, and although she shows occasional signs of depth, the role, or moreso the sci-fi nature of the plot seems to escape her. Loken is suitably wooden as the emotionless T-X, and lacks the weasel-like menace of Robert Patrick's T-1000. Her battles with Arnie are impressive however. <br/><br/>And then there's Arnie himself. He's always been great at non-emotive, physical acting, and he once again performs well here. The Austrian accent seems thicker than ever, and although he moves a little slower, he still projects power and strength. His whole career was built on films that emphasised his physical presence, filling the screen with his muscles and big aura. But every action hero's career comes to an end. In a fitting epitaph to his career, the Terminator speaks of being an obsolete model, without any purpose. Just as well Arnie ended his career here, with a role and film that symbolised Arnold Schwarzenegger the actor perfectly."
"gigan-92","5","10","14","12 June 2010"," Found It Enjoyable
","I'll say that for the most part this third film by Johnathan Mostow is pretty decent. He clearly made an effort to bring back the same atmosphere that was present in the first two films. This I very much enjoyed that aspect of it all. However, there is a somewhat diminished sense of realism in my opinion. This new terminator has flamethrowers and plasma cannons, built in of course. Oh geez... But I've come to embrace that actually. Except for that scene with KAte's 'fiance'. Didn't anyone notice a guy driving with an arm through his gut. Overdone...<br/><br/>The cast is rather well put together, I'll give it that. Gool old Arnold is able to reprise his role as the T-101. Unfortunately this will be the final bout. John Connor is portrayed by Nick Stahil, and he does nicely. One other weakness to this film is the run time. The second film was over two hours, and there was plenty of action and what not. But there was still lots of time for character development throughout. We saw the characters' inner demons, you know? The story in ""Rise of the Machines"" certainly has nice plot points, but their not used to full their potential. Not only that Kate Brewster's father and Skynet. We only see an early scene ""greeting"" scene as a phone chat and short conversation about the system's dangers; and later the opening of ""Pandora's Box"". It was constantly hinted at that Skynet was already beginning its attack in subtle ways, so why not show a little more of the government tension? Getting away from that, the action is superb. Winston's studio does its job with artistic talent. I can say without a doubt the Terminators are looking better than ever. My favorite action scene by far had to be the hand-to-hand fight sequence. I find myself constantly rewinding it. Another plus is Marco Beltrami, one of my favorite composers. I'm definitely not let down. And so, Terminator 3 is an all in all decent contender, but it did not surpass either of the previous films.<br/><br/>""Desire is irrelevant. I AM a machine!"""

","Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken star in this 2003 sci-fi sequel. In this sequel, John Connor (Stahl) is older and living his life on the road secretly. He's about to meet another T-101 cyborg (Schwarzenegger) sent to protect him from a lethal female prototype assassin called, a T-X (Lokken). John reunites with an old girlfriend, Kate Brewster (Danes) who gets into the action because she's John's future wife and daughter of an Air Force General. This isn't a bad sequel, but it's not as good as the first 2 films and I missed Linda Hamilton. I still recommend this for your Terminator collection."

","The third film in the Terminator franchise sees Arnold Schwarzenegger return as a T-850 sent back to ensure John Connor and his future wife Kate Brewster survive the impending Judgment Day whilst a rival Terminator, the T-X, hunts down and kills people important to the future human resistance.<br/><br/>Jonathan Mostow steps into James Cameron's big directing boots and produces an enjoyable follow up to the previous instalments but also provides nothing outstanding either. The action scenes are directed competently but you really do feel as if some flair is missing that Cameron would've brought to the film, although the stand-out chase sequence involving a crane truck, two police cars, a fire engine and an ambulance features scenes of automobile destruction rivalled only by The Blues Brothers.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl does a good job of portraying a John Connor haunted by his impending legacy and struggling to come to terms with his destiny without the guidance of his now deceased mother (Sarah Connor having died of leukemia off screen between T2 & T3) but you can't help thinking that the film would've benefited hugely from the involvement of Edward Furlong who was originally lined up to return in the role but pulled out and/or let go by the producers as a result of his then current substance problems. Claire Danes does well with an under written role of Connor's future wife and Kristina Loken does a great Robert Patrick impression as the T-X, the latest in Terminator assassins from the future.<br/><br/>Essentially a remake of T2, what gives this film extra points is the unexpected twist ending (which I'll discuss without spoiler boxes as the film is 6 years old so if you haven't seen the film, look away now!) It's very rare these days in cinema that a summer blockbuster ends on a downbeat note but the makers of T3 deserve kudos for ending the film with the destruction of 3 billion human lives in the nuclear apocalypse and actually bringing about the event that even Cameron avoided, Judgment Day. The ending alone makes up for the slight feeling throughout the film that you've seen it all before. This film could've so easily been a standard run around with an obligatory happy ending but in bringing the franchise full circle, they take the films away from the now tired concept of Terminators being sent back to present day and give the franchise the opportunity to move the story forward instead of it remaining stagnant. It's just a shame that they didn't build on that promise with the fourth film. 8/10"

","Those machines won't give up. After sending a Terminator back in time to kill John Connor's mother in the fist movie, then a T-1000 to kill a teenage John in the sequel, now the time-traveling cyborg assassin is a T-X (Kristanna Loken), targeting twenty-something John (Nick Stahl) and his future wife (Claire Danes). *Of course* the rebels send back another android (Schwarzenegger) to stop the T-X.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 lacks tension, mostly because of the weak villain. Loken, with her supermodel looks, is utterly wrong for the part, as she tries and fails to mimic Robert Patrick's superb performance in the previous film. Patrick, with his glacial stare and sinister body language, conveyed a deep sense of menace. Loken is terrible - her stiff walk, the comical way she tilts her head... it's a vapid, inane performance. The only mildly clever use of the new female terminator is a five-second scene where she looks at a lingerie advertisement and inflates her bust to a bigger size; it took the android only a quick glance to understand how to be more persuasive in our sexist society.<br/><br/>Stahl is a better actor than Furlong in Terminator 2, but writing in his scenes with Danes is cringe-inducing. Ahnold is Ahnold.<br/><br/>Plot is nonsensical and contradicts the whole point of the previous movies. So, is Judgement Day inevitable or not? Future *can* be altered, but only in plot-convenient ways? Sorry, time travel stories require a little more thought than that.<br/><br/>All would be forgiven if this boasted magnificent action, but director Mostow, who made the decent submarine flick U-571, doesn't deliver anything memorable. Say what you want of James Cameron, but the man knows his set-pieces.<br/><br/>5/10"
"Marksd99","1","36","63","24 August 2006"," Metallic hell on earth
","OK, so critically i'm forced to accept that my one star rating could be seen as maybe a bit harsh, the action was OK after all, the film looked pretty enough and the story was genuinely not as slap-dash and floored as we all dreaded it would be. As a stand alone film i could've genuinely forgiven this movie it's quirky sense of humor and cartoonish action sequences (that comedy 'DUNK' noise when Arnie is hit by a truck whilst riding the forklift truck is pure Wylee Kyote). <br/><br/>However, that's where we hit the real meat of my problem with this movie, it's not just any random piece of action pie, it's the sequel to terminator 2, a film which even if you don't consider to be the greatest action movie of all time (which i emphatically do), everyone must agree had a certain iconic, macho appeal and tone. <br/><br/>Now i accept that for a fairly unknown director, resuscitating such a beloved and successful franchise after such a long time must've been daunting, and i thoroughly expected to sit back in my comfortable cinema seat and watch with joy as the third terminator strained with mighty, piston-like muscles in an effort to avoid being crushed under the weight of its prequels. So you can begin to imagine my disappointment when rather than standing up to its prequels with its chest puffed out, T3 seemed rather to make a camp hand gesture and prance away. <br/><br/>In short, my greatest problem with T3 is not that it isn't as good as its predecessors (i mean what is?), it's that it often feels like you're watching a spoofed remake, an impression not harmed by the fact that T3 'shares' most of its basic plot structure with T2. Case in point would have to be the scene in which the terminator seeks to acquire his trade mark leather jacket ensemble, although in previous films this simply seems to be the first outfit he found, in T3 it seems nothing else would do. <br/><br/>You can almost hear the writers laughing and congratulating themselves at their sparkling wit, as the terminator is forced to regurgitate his iconic ""i need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle"" line... to a male stripper. And the icing on the cake, when the 'unstoppable killing machine' walks outside and puts on the pair of pink, Elton john-style, star sunglasses: and the writers laugh, and the producers laugh and i die a little bit inside.<br/><br/>However, the saddest thing i found, watching this movie was not the horrible, gimmick ridden plotting (ooo... lets make this evil terminator a girl!!!!!) that coated each scene, but the much broader plot-strokes that smashed into the terminator mythology like a certain hanging steel girder into a certain skull. Killing off Sarah Conner (the only woman ever created who could've kicked Lt. Ripley's ass) off screen no less, shifting the credit for saving mankind from John Conner (who's become a pussy instead of a super-soldier) to 'his wife?!?'. Its these massive blows that seem to have crippled a franchise that always seemed to have one last movie in it.<br/><br/>However, i must freely admit that to most people this movie represents a small slice of action escapism that should warrant at least an hour and a half of you time if not your thoughts. But for me, and anyone else who bothered to learn to spell 'mimetic polyalloy' it's like watching a once proud bear being made to dance in a dirty tutu for the mild amusement of its owners.<br/><br/>I always maintain that T2 was one of the saddest movies i've ever seen, at least in that way T3 managed to emulate it."

Some other friends said that there was a more humorous side to it, so I went into the movie expecting a hammed up version of its predessosor; however, the ""comedic"" scenes just added to the entertainment of the movie, they did not detract from it's seriousness that the end of the earth as we know is near. The ending was fantastic and added more intrigue to the idea that machines will rule the earth and fight mankind for its rule.

","Mostow has injected a lot of the same spirit from previous Terminator films into Terminator 3, cleverly causing you to undergo a bit of what weightlifters call `muscle memory.' Although wildly entertaining and pleasantly reminiscent of past films, Terminator 3 as a whole did not resonate like the first two films. That's not to say it didn't achieve greatness, just not the type of greatness Cameron achieved in the good old days. The key change from Cameron to Mostow proved too dissonant for some fans. Cameronistas resent Mostow's style as action over substance. Reading their remarks on the movie forums would have one believe the film represents more of a lowering of humans than rising of machines. T3 is not T2. Mostow is not Cameron. Let James Cameron be James Cameron, or at least Jim Cameron, and let everyone else be themselves.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had to hold its ground and simply not be bad. It held. It did more than that. It succeeded. Humor, action, and preservation of the Terminator motifs gave the film life. The word `terminated' will continue to live as a great movie euphemism. Whether or not the Terminator series will rise again, only time will tell.<br/><br/>

","As a big fan of the Terminator movies, 1 and 2 were superb! Unfortunately, T3 suffers from the ""Hollywood blockbuster"" syndrome, the need to out perform and surpass its predecessors with bigger, bolder, more blast-worthy action. Chases and nitroglycerine abound in this film as characterization is pushed to the background.<br/><br/>To be fair, very little characterization is needed except for the Claire Danes character. Unless you've been living in an isolated commune for the past 20 years, you know the Terminator. Arnold's persona has become pop culture myth -- like the Six Million Dollar Man writ large. Stahl's character, John Connor, is still the ordinary man tormented by his awesome destiny.<br/><br/>T3 does deliver the stunts, the explosions, even the catchy one-liners to which we've become accustomed. Arnold's performance is stellar. His charm breathes humanity into an automaton (Gov. Schwarzenegger one day perhaps?). Stahl is competent, while Danes is immeasurably underused. Note her role as Juliet in Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet -- but hey, this isn't Henry James. Kristanna Loken is good as well, sexily exuding VERY homicidal tendencies.<br/><br/>I agree with Roger Ebert in saying that T3 is really a dumbed down version of its history. Were it not for the creative ending, I probably wouldn't have been as impressed. That said, T3 is a worthy addition to the franchise."
"droog-56936","7","8","11","8 November 2019"," Sexy T-X Makes The Movie
","Despite the hate it gets Terminator 3 is a solid movie that ties off the trilogy nicely and wraps the characters in a loop that takes us round to the first movie. Kristanna Loken is perfect as the T-X, a new more advanced Terminator sent to kill the adult John Conor this time. Her deadpan performance really brings a emotionless but murderous reality to the character. Robotic perfection. The action and special effects are very well done and the ending brings the story arc to a it's logical conclusion.
The problem here is casting Nick Stahl and Claire Danes as John Conor and his prospective romance partner Katherine Brewster, have no chemistry and even worse it becomes a stretch to accept Stahl as a future leader of humanity when those qualities are missing in the entire performance here.
Flawed it may be but Arnold Schwarzenegger battling Kristanna Loken is still amazingly fun. Go rent it or better yet, buy it!"
"MrP823","1","17","28","2 July 2003"," Is this supposed to be good?
","My God. I really don't know where to begin. I guess I should start with the obvious fact that this film was completely unnecessary.  Most scenes in the movie seem to have been blatantly lifted directly from the second film so much so that at many times I felt as though I was watching a remake. After sitting through this mess I had a whole new respect for the first two films as being action/sci-fi classics. I have a sneaky suspicion that this ""movie"" will be one of those over priced blockbuster hopefuls that will be all but forgotten a few years from now. <br/><br/>The absence of James Cameron is greatly felt from the opening shot of T3, to its dreadful ending. Although he has been considered controversial because of his constant perfectionism, I guarantee you that the shameful and embarrassing acting as well as the copied storyline would not be found in the third installment had he been involved. Then again, the reason Cameron was not at the helm for this one was because he simply felt there was no more story. Things were pretty tied up at the end of T2, wouldn't you say? There isn't even a proper explanation as to why the events in T3 are even happening.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, you just knew a third movie was going to be made and people would be having visions of Terminator greatness on their minds. It's sad to realize that fans of the Terminator films will no doubt be very disappointed (at least I think they will be). There really is nothing good about this movie and it scares me to death to think that if this particular sequel to a very well known couple of movies was this terrible, what does this hold for some of the other announced or planned big money sequels to movie franchises. If Indiana Jones 4, Die Hard 4, or even Mad Max 4 are nearly as bad as this film, God help us all.<br/><br/>One more point I would like to stress concerning this movie would be its message/philosophy. Let me get this straight, the main point of the story is that humans simply cannot avoid what is inevitable? This is in absolute contradiction to the second film's meaning of ""No Fate But What We Make"" in which disaster can be averted if we all just wake up and realize what is about to go down. So in other words, the optimistic ending of the second film is replaced by a complete downer ending in the third film that is just hideous in how weak it is. This is bad, really bad and I have to believe that James Cameron is smoking hot with anger. I am going to try my hardest to pretend that this film (and whatever may follow it) never existed. That way I can appreciate just how entertaining and interesting the first two stories indeed are."

Far more advanced and deadlier than the previous cyborg assassains, Terminex has been programed not only to take out John Conner, but his future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Daines)as well. What follows is the kind of mayhem not previously seen in TERMINATOR 1 or JUDGEMENT DAY. The two cyborgs manage to wipe out two city blocks with a giant tow truck, and later do battle in a men's washroom smashing each other with toilets and urinals (somehow, it's not as ludicrous  as it sounds).

"johnnycage10","10","24","43","22 October 2003"," One of the best movies of all time
","I'm really surprised at all the negative reviews T3 is receiving. It was as good as the previous two Terminator films, which makes this franchise the only title out there that's great, quality entertainment without any interruptions of garbage in the middle (ala Alien 3). Of the many positive aspects about this film that all the critics out there ignore because they're too busy on the Miss James Cameron bandwagon, here's some:<br/><br/> ***********SPOILERS************<br/><br/>From the start we definitely missed Linda Hamilton's character from T2, as she was the best (though not only) asset from that film. But Nick Stahl did as good a job as her here in taking over as the human who was caught in the middle of a battle of titans. I had a bad feeling about this actor when I first saw that Edward Furlong wasn't coming back for T3, but my doubts were quickly put down when I saw how good an actor he was, playing an incredibly well-written character. Here we have a brooding, depressed John Connor who doesn't want the role of humanity's leader, feeling that way especially after his mother died and after having watched the only friend he had, the T800 from T2, leaving him at the end of the second film. He never thought that he was good enough to carry this huge responsibility, but he also suspected that he couldn't avoid it no matter how much he just wanted to disappear off the map, thus the nightmare of a chilling army of terminators who were seen approaching the screen as a dream to him after he dropped the bottle of beer into the lake whose ground was covered with skulls. But the fact that this guy was willing to put a gun to his own head to pressure the T800 to help them try to stop Skynet was proof that he was as good as his reputation said, as no one would be more qualified to lead the humans after the apocalypse as a person who showed that much heart and backbone at that scene.<br/><br/>Following that, we have action and special effects that are incredible to watch, surprises ala the coffin full of weapons and the fact that it was Kate who sent the T800 back instead of John being the one who did so, as well as humor like the sunglasses at the beginning and the `talk to the hand' comment as the T800 was taking food out of the store, which made the entire theater laugh where I was.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, we have a battle between machines, but not between the T800 and the TX, as expected, but between the T800 and the earliest terminator models that the TX reprogrammed, sending them out to massacre people. So we have the early terminators killing people and the only one who's fighting back against them is the T800, machine versus machine for the lives of the human survivors who were in the compound hanging in the balance. The T800 reached a level of humanity there that it never expected to have. And that was followed with it rebelling against the reprogram it then received from the TX to kill John and Kate, which made it into a much more sympathetic character than it ever was in T1 and T2. And this rebellion within the T800 was conceivable since the TX was used to ordering neutral machines to do its bidding (ie, cars). But the T800 already had an order to protect, thus the new orders to kill were coming into conflict with the previous ones, thus leading it to prefer to shut itself off rather than go against its original orders. Whether its interaction with John and Kate had any say in its decision is something that's debatable, of course, as it was fine with being reprogrammed to save Kate after its very first orders by Skynet were to kill humans. So in the future, it accepted its second orders to protect just fine, but not its third orders in the present time to return to killing. Begs the question as to why.<br/><br/>And lastly, there's the ending, which I'll just summarize as being one that was a jaw-dropping surprise. I won't say what it is here in case there's anyone out there who's waiting to see this film on tape or DVD, but suffice it to say that you won't see it coming and it'll leave you on the edge of your seat. With John and Kate totally exhausted and realizing that they did all they could and all there is to do now is watch their efforts unfold while waiting for the future.<br/><br/>So when all is said and done, I can say that James Cameron can return to doing Titanic 2 or another lousy show like Dark Angel if he wants, but if he doesn't wish to participate here, he's not needed as J. Mostow is doing just great. Anyone who wants to watch garbage can see Matrix Reloaded, a movie whose only premise is making as many marketing products from the once-great Matrix title as possible. But for those who demand quality for their money, it's clear what the best movie of this year is. My only question now is, where is T4?! It's time for John Connor to take charge."
"The_Director","8","76","157","31 July 2003"," A Different Type of Terminator ---86%
","FIRST IMPRESSIONS<br/><br/>I just couldnt imagine a better sequel to Terminator 2: Judgement Day, which is probably the best action movie of all time.  But, after seeing T3: Rise of the Machines, I came to one conclusion: T2 and T3 are different types of movies.  And T3 ends up on top.<br/><br/>
SUMMARY<br/><br/>The famous John Conner is all grown up now, and yes, you guessed it, is still being hunted down by robots sent from the future.  But this time around, its no ordinary robot.  The Terminatrix is far more superior in speed, strength and intelligence than John Conner's only chance for survival.  Yes, the Terminator is back, but he has to protect not only John Conner, but also a mysterious young woman whose purpose throughout the war with the machines appears to be unknown.<br/><br/>
FUN FACTOR: 95%<br/><br/>This movie is one fun thing to watch.  Probably the most exciting movie to watch this year, and that includes The Matrix: Reloaded.  Every scene in this action masterpiece, even the dramatic scenes, is vividly interesting. I remember when I was watching this movie in the theater, and halfway through I dropped my hot dog on my shirt.  And it was nasty, all this relish and onion and ketchup all over.  But, I didn't really care; I just kept on watching.  Maybe, I'm just crazy.<br/><br/>
ACTING: 85%<br/><br/>Well, lets start with none other than The Terminator.  With a far greater arsenal of humorous lines and actions (the reoccurring scenes with the sunglasses), the Terminator's ""personality"" is far more expressed in this film than in the previous two.  And the new additions of Claire Danes and Nick Stahl efficiently make up for the missing Linda Hamilton.  The T-X (Terminatrix) shows as much emotion as she can, which is not much.  But, hey, she's a killing robot.  Still, overall, decent acting by the main stars, and great improvement by Arnold in the comedy department.<br/><br/>
STORY: 80 %<br/><br/>What made the first two installments classics was the storyline.  Its intricate plot, full of twists of time travel effects, the first two movies were not only action movies, but thrillers.  And, this element is what lacks in T3.  Now, this is such a bad thing.  T3 just happens to be more of an action movie.  The movie had some elements of time travel and the future war here and there, but not as much as the first two.  Still, the end of the movie (I'm not going to give anything away) left me with a bunch of questions.  And thats a good thing.  A really good thing.<br/><br/>
DIRECTION: 85%<br/><br/>When I found out that James Cameron was not going to do the upcoming Terminator, I thought this is going to be a blowout.  But it wasnt. Jonathan Mostow took the job, and made an excellent movie.  I have to admit, T3 has a totally different look from the last two.  While the first two were darker, T3 is more explosion.  Its mainly because T-1000, equipped with only his hands and the shapes they can become, relies more on stealth and close combat.  With that type of enemy, the atmosphere of the movie must always be dark.  In T3, however, the T-X relies on guns and, therefore, at-a-distance type combat.  That creates more explosions and less blood.  That's another thing, T3 is not even close to being as violent as the first two.  To sum up, T3 has a lighter look compared to its predecessors, but is still successful in this transition.<br/><br/>
FINAL IMPRESSION: ---86%<br/><br/>With an excellent cast of characters, breathtaking action scenes, and a little bit of fresh humor added in, T3 is, undoubtedly, a worthy addition to a classic series."
"gothicgoblin1334","1","22","40","19 June 2006"," It stinks, and it gives James Cameron a bad name
","Before I forward the review I must tell you that this movie simply gives James Cameron and the terminator series a bad name. I find that all the loud action scenes and partial nudity a bore to me for it does not make the writing material or acting or quality any better. OK, on with the review...<br/><br/>Hollywood made an attempt to make another chapter in the sci-fi trilogy of The Terminator. A rise of the machines as they planned to do it, yet they failed to do so. There is no James Cameron in this movie; it's almost like he never made the terminator; which is a shame because he is the true creative force behind the machines as well as his friend who helped write this movie. Anyway, the movie starts out with Nick Stahl speaking his story of the terminators and of such material and judgement day. I will give them credit that they followed the concept of the second one even though they should have been more original. However we do not see the notorious and wonderful Linda Hamilton in this film; which pretty much gives the audience a chance to look at it more negatively. True, they follow the elements of Shwartzennagger and judgement day but this was simply a bad Hollywood attempt at resurrecting this movie from the nineties. They put gigantic loud noises (to cover the audience's mouths from saying: ""Hey, WHERE'S THE BEEF) they put big explosions (so the producers could 'eliminate' their problems but failed like they did here) and they put out of place vulgarity huomour (as to change the subject of the critics when they bring up this movie) but if you are to take all that away, and I mean all of it, then you simply get what this movie really is: another failed Hollywood big budget action movie; simplifying nothing."
"dominator13","8","7","10","15 July 2003"," Surprised by T3.
","After being completely disappointed by the horrendous extended A-Team episode known as T2, (Maybe the biggest drop of in quality from original to sequel ever) I was prepared to really hate T3. Maybe the lower expectations played a role, but the movie surprised me. It doesn't live up to the original of course, but it far surpasses T2. The action is tremendous, the fight scenes between the Terminators are much better than in T2, and the chase scene outdoes The Matrix Reloaded in my opinion. Throw in a great ending and I'm actually hoping we won't have to wait ten years for the next one."
"Theo Robertson","4","16","28","31 May 2009"," Uninvolving And Dumb Franchise Movie
","The original TERMINATOR showed what can be done via a relatively small budget and a very tight script and even today remains one of the finest thought proving films in the sci-fi genre . TERMINATOR 2 : JUDGEMENT DAY showed one of the problems with Hollywood and that is milk an idea for all it's worth . I can understand why many people enjoyed the sequel - everything is bigger , bolder but not better since sequels usually jettison things like intelligence and characterization , things that made the original so involving . With TERMINATOR 3 RISE OF THE MACHINES we see a very good example of why intelligent , involving films should never become a franchise <br/><br/>First off we see the set up which is absolutely no different from JUDEMENT DAY . A new super dooper terminator ( T-X ) is sent back to the past to kill future resistance leaders so the human race send Arnie back to stop it . Bad enough Arnie is introduced in a humorous way in the sequel but here it's done in an entirely camp manner , almost self parody . Not only that there's ridiculous plot holes involved such as why wait hours before the nuclear war before killing the resistance leaders or having an obsolete terminator protecting John Connor and co ? Perhaps the lack of internal continuity is worse where the T-X steals a gun to kill its victims when it's later revealed that the T-X has the capability to shoot people with a ray-gun . It's one of these films where you're left with the impression that the screenwriters are making things up as they go along<br/><br/>This is Summer blockbuster entertainment which unfortunately comes across as being very old hat . There's car chases , explosions and stunts . However between the release of films two and three in the franchise blockbuster entertainment had changed . No longer had films to rely on star power , not that Arnie was much of a big name in 2003 , nor did they have to rely on explosions . HARRY POTTER and LORD OF THE RINGS had become the new event movies , Anglophile films with literary sources . Watching overlong , loud chase sequences filled with explosions and zero plot and character development might have worked in the 1980s and 90s but had obviously become extinct at the turn of the century . When you're watching set piece action sequences whilst glancing at your watch this can only be an unmitigated failure <br/><br/>There is one set piece that does work and that is when Skynet comes online and the newly developed weapons systems start exterminating their human creators . Indeed watching this sequence I was instantly struck as to how well the film could have worked if this had been the central core of the film . Don't bother writing iT-X or Arnie in to the movie , get rid of chase sequence and make a much darker , smaller budget film that contains drama . But I guess that would have been beyond the intelligence of Hollywood studios"
"Lando_Hass","1","21","39","3 July 2004"," The absence of James Cameron is very noticeable (spoilers)
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines follows the 1984 hit Terminator, and the 1991 hit Terminator 2: Judgment Day, two intelligent, well made films. T3 is the complete opposite of Terminator 1 and 2. Terminator 1 and 2 were both intelligent films, with a style and wit that to this day is unmatched. T3 was directed by Jonathon Mostow, a guy who knows how to handle his actions scenes, but a guy who also has no respect for T3's predecessors. Mostow has made some movies in the past, but I've only seen one: Breakdown. Breakdown was a very good movie that fleshed out it's characters and had a distinct feeling to it. Breakdown was a good movie. I liked it a lot. But, back to T3. T3 has some VERY entertaining and very well directed action scenes. But that's the problem. The movie is all action scenes, with no complex merit whatsoever. Though I like the action scenes, I have a strong problem with the way the movie was handled story wise. Jonathon Mostow, like I said, knows how to handle his actions scenes, and I'm sure he likes the previous Terminator movies. The problem is that he has no respect for the complex plot that comes with the first two movies. The first movies had a few holes, but they still managed to explain everything coherently. Terminator 3 does not do that. Jonathon Mostow completely ignores everything from the first movies, there are so many plot holes and questions that are unanswered, like how did Skynet suddenly continue development even though everything was destroyed in T2, and how does (SPOILER) Judgment Day suddenly become inevitable even though in the first films they make it clear that it can be stopped. All of these questions are unanswered, and as I sat in the theater almost exactly a year ago, I noticed all of these problems. When I walked out of the theater, I absolutely despised this movie because it betrayed the first films. I bought the DVD, and I didn't hate it as much. My feelings towards it now are mixed. <br/><br/>This time around, a female Terminator, the T-X, is sent back through time to kill John Conner (and someone else, who I wont mention). Again, the T-800 (I call it the T-800 because T-101 is a load of bulls***) is sent back to protect John. Here's another plot hole though: In the ending, they say Judgment Day is inevitable, so why would they bother to send a Terminator back to kill John? John was the one to prevent the war, but according to this movie, the war was going to happen no matter what, so why bother sending them back to kill John? The T-X objective is to 'Ensure the rise of the machines.' If the rising of the machines is inevitable, why would they send her back to ensure it? John couldn't have stopped the rise of the machines because it was inevitable, so why send them back? It just doesn't make a bit of sense. Jonathon Mostow could have also acknowledged a reason just to clear the air, like he could of said the arm that cut off from the T-800 in the first film was found by some people and used that to create the Terminators, and even though finding an arm and making an army of machines from it would be implausible it would still fill some plot holes and answer some questions. Instead, Jonathon Mostow goes down the path of the summer action movie, he loads his movie with nonstop shooting, nonstop explosions, and nonstop special effects, and as much as I enjoyed these fights, explosions, and bullets it still doesn't change the fact that the movie betrayed it's predecessors. <br/><br/>The T-X is played by Kristanna Loken, this is probably her first major role in a film. Loken is a hot blonde who had the potential to be a good Terminator but again, because of Jonathon Mostow, she failed. The greatest thing about Robert Patrick's performance in the first film was the fact that he was grim, he had absolutely no emotion in his face AT ALL, he truly embodied the characteristics of a cyborg, and he did one of the most grim performances in film history (in my opinion). Kristanna Loken doesn't do that. In most scenes, when Loken is supposed to show no emotion and not show any pleasure in killing, she does the opposite, and this is because Jonathon Mostow's crappy directing. More than half the time, Loken has a smirk on her face, and when she talks, she has WAY too much movement in her face. Supposedly, Jonathon Mostow liked the idea of having the T-X smirk, so he told Kristana to keep doing it, but Mostow forgets one thing: Loken is supposed to be a machine, one that isn't supposed to smile or anything like that, and sometimes, it looks like the T-X is taking pleasure in killing just by the look on her face, but people know pleasure is a human feeling, and people know machines cant have an human feelings. Robert Patrick made the T-1000 one of the best villains in film history, sadly, Kristana Loken didn't do anything she could with the T-X character, and it's mostly Jonathon Mostow's fault, the guy only knows how to direct explosions and car chases, but when it comes to directing complex characters like machines he fails. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the T-800 (again, I'm not calling it the T-101), and like his performances in the first films, it is top notch. Arnold is able to maintain the same feeling he pulled off in T1 and T2, without really changing the character. Arnold doesn't show emotions, but in T2, he does have emotions, and that's the point of his character in the end, but I guess in this he didn't really need to show the traits he had in the first movie. Arnold has aged over the years, but still proves that regardless of age, he can still be an action star, his performance is good, but in T2 he did a better job, probably because in that movie his character had more depth, more areas to explore like emotions, but in this one, all he has to do is be there and be a machine. In T2, Edward Furlong played John Conner. Furlong was signed on to this when it was announced, but due to drug and drinking problems, he was fired from the project, and Nick Stahl was hired the be John Conner. At first, I thought Stahl was a terrible choice to be John Conner, but it turns out that he actually did a good job at being the character. His acting job wasn't as good as Furlong's, but it was still pretty good. I cant say that replacing Furlong with Nick Stahl was a better idea because Furlong is the one who gave life to the character, but Nick Stahl does give a good performance.<br/><br/>When it comes to story, Terminator 3 falls flat on it's ass. Jonathon Mostow knows how to handle his actions scenes and his explosions and all that s***, but he doesn't know how to handle the storyline. When the predecessors to the movie you're doing are Terminator 1 and 2, you need to make sure that the story is preserved, you need to make sure that you fill each plot hole and explain everything, but the Terminator storyline is a storyline that can only be handled by one person: James Cameron. Jonathon Mostow chooses to ignore virtually everything. What he does to make sure audiences don't see these holes is he piles on an avalanche of action scenes, explosions, and guns, and even though I love all these things in movies, Terminator movies are more than just explosions and action. Jonathon Mostow seemed to want to just make his own movie, and just call it Terminator, because this movie has no relation to the first, it simply ignores every plot point and just tries to cloak all the holes with action, action, and more action. There is almost no character development, the pacing is completely off target, the movie is nothing but action.<br/><br/>The T-X was once intended to be a male Terminator, and to tell you the truth, it would have worked better that way. Kirstana Loken is extremely hot, but I don't think she fits in the role. It was said that Vin Diesel was considered for the role of the T-X, and to tell you the truth, Diesel would have been an excellent choice, because I think Diesel would have been able to not show any emotion, he would have been able to convey a dark, ruthless nature with the character, and he simply would have fit the role perfectly. Most people say no, they say Vin Diesel sucks, but these people let the popcorn movies he's done overshadow his good performances. In A Man Apart, Diesel did an excellent job at conveying the bitterness and darkness of the character, in Boiler Room his performance was good, and in Knockaround Guys his performance was also very good. Diesel would have fit perfectly as a Terminator, just as long as Jonathon Mostow didn't have anything to do with the movie. Diesel would have made the role work, he would have made the character emotionless and ruthless. He would have fit better than anyone else.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 was one of those sequels that nobody really asked for. Terminator 1 and 2 were two of the best films I've ever seen, and Terminator 2 finished off everything leaving no questions. Terminator 3 was not asked for, it should have never been made. The only reason why it was made was for one reason: Money. It's production budget was 175 million I believe, but it only made 150 million, which means it tanked, but a T4 is going to be made, without Arnold most likely, and Jonathon Mostow is supposedly going to direct. It's going to be a disaster, it's going to be a repeat of this. Mostow should be banned from making anything involving Terminator, he has no respect for the Terminator movies, he betrayed them, and he simply didn't care. Most people will say 'Terminator 3 was just supposed to be a summer action movie, it wasn't supposed to be complex, it was just supposed to be fun.' Statements like these are irrelevant, because the Terminator movies weren't ever supposed to be summer action films, they were supposed to be smart action movies with depth, they weren't supposed to be mindless like this. If Terminator 4 is made by Jonathon Mostow, it'll suck ass. If it's made by Cameron, it'll be great. T3 had so many unanswered questions like how did Skynet continue production, how could Judgment Day be inevitable, and how could anyone actually approve this movie without thinking about the complexity and wit of the first two films?<br/><br/>Score: 3 out of 10."

","Termionator 3: Rise of the machines is part of the third part curse. Though it's not the weakest in the series. The Plot: Arnold Swartzenegger returns as a new Terminator model. He is sent back once a gain to protect John Conner, the future resistance leader, and Kate Brewster,who is John's future wife. The Terminator has a new villain. The T-X, who is stronger,and could easily defeat The Terminator. The plot isn't quite as complex as the first two films. Terminator 3: Rise of the machines is a good summer film. Though it came out six years ago, it was good for it's time. I love Claire Danes and was surprised when I found out that she was in it. Kristanna Loken (who's Michelle Rodriguez's lover)is a pretty good villain. I was rooting for her while watching the film, though I knew she was going to lose. But both Arnold and her blew up. I am giving Terminator 3: Rise of the machines a recommendation. The problem I have with it is that I don't like Nick Stahl as John Conner. I Don't think this film is as well thought out as the others. Though it's more thought out than Terminator: Salvation, which I gave the same rating. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is occasionally funny and entertaining. It may not be as good as the original or T2(which is the best and one of the best ever), but Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a lot of fun."

","I saw this movie on the first day it came out! It was awesome, entertaining, I understood the storyline(Why the T-X was killing off people in the beginning, etc.), and I thought it was very Interesting, the action scenes were better than Terminator 2: Judgment Day's. The only faults in this movie is that it wasn't directed by James Cameron and that James Cameron didn't write it. The Visual Effects were superb although some of them did look a little fake, but so did Terminator 2's T-1000, it looked fake, so I'm not going to gripe about the Visual Effects. I feel the visual effects are needed to fabricate scenes that are too hard for the actors to do and is also needed to make a great film(take The Lord of the Rings films for instance) but, there are instances when Directors go a little to far with the Visual Effects in their films. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a great film, great acting (still by Ol' Arnold Schwarzeneggar, of course), great action scenes, and great storyline. When watching this film I got a sense of deja vu because if anybody has seen The Animatrix it sort of talks about Nuclear War also(just my opinion). Does anyone agree? Well the rating on the IMDB website for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines should go up because I think it deserves a better rating than a 7.3/10, may be a 7.8/10, at least. Well those are my thoughts and Feelings about this film, thank You for reading.                              Oh, by the way, I gave this film a 10/10 on the IMDB website's rating system, I think you should too."

","They should have left well enough alone. The only thing that saved this movie was the ending, otherwise it is a complete waste of time. Even the two or three humorous lines by Arnie can't make up for the poor plot, poor writing, and excessive special effects.<br/><br/>This was definitely made for young men, the T-X sucked, she wasn't menacing, interesting, or threatening, unlike the T-1000 in T2. But she had big boobs. Whoopie.<br/><br/>The acting of the two main human characters was mediocre at best. I'm not sure what the writers and director were thinking making John so slow witted and insipid, it did nothing but irritate and annoy.<br/><br/>I bought this sight-unseen to have the complete series, and I'm sorry I wasted my money.

","I suppose I should grateful that we have been graced with a final installment just to tidy things up given the enthusiasm for trilogies of late but, is this one wise? I think not. Pointless and very, very disappointing is more apt. I have been generous in my rating. What Terminator 3 shows is that the absence of a good story cannot be patched up with the now all too familiar CG scenes. Arnie looks and is old and the intensity that Linda Hamilton brought to the earlier two films is gone. The plot was almost certainly written in the 1950's and Ed Wood did it better. It's as if it's a plot searching for a reason to be and hoping no-one will notice the colour by numbers patchwork that passes for a storyline. This could have been wrapped up in 20 minutes in the vastly superior T2, had it been written. In the end we are being treated to an exercise in pure capitalism.  In summary if you're a fan you may enjoy it , if not avoid."

"patriciogl10","7","2","2","13 December 2019"," Arguably the better one amongst a string of failed offerings.
","I honestly believe this third Terminator entry has been unjustly critized and hated, for when you really think about it, it's not as bad a lot of people make it out to be. I can even go further by saying it's probably the better film out of Salvation and Genisys, and many would agree.
Most problems lie with the specifics surrounding the storyline, which hits many bumps along the way and does nothing to straighten them out, that is why in the third act you sort of see the cracks and plotholes become more evident as it gets near the end.<br/><br/>Still, there's a heavily enjoyable aspect coming from the side of the entertaining action, featuring a well-done car chase sequence that could put
other generic car chases to shame. In the acting department, Arnold still does his thing we know so well; Nick Stahl proves himself worthy as a cowardly but intuitive John Connor, who doesn't know what the future holds for him; Claire Danes wonderfully serves as a natural complement to Connor: strong, smart and efficient.
Good call on the casting director to recruit actors who's forte doesn't rely on action nor science fiction, it turned out incredibly well. Kristanna Lokken is a formidable T-X model, inspiring menacing fear to each of the human characters involved.<br/><br/>I suggest you give this one another go, and embrace it for what it is, an acceptable follow-up to the best Terminator film ever."

","Part III(now directed by Jonathan Mostow) picks up the story of an adult John Connor(now played by Nick Stahl, who is fine, taking over from Edward Furlong) effectively living off the grid, who nonetheless finds himself pursued again by a new cyborg assassin from the future(a beautiful woman this time, nicely played by Kristanna Loken) who stumbles onto John by accident, since she was sent back to his time to assassinate all other resistance members who had nearly wiped out the machines. Once again though a familiar face(Arnold of course!) is sent back one last time to protect him(or is he?) Fantastic action punctuates this intriguing story about inevitable fate that cannot be shaped the way the Connors had hoped(Sarah is absent here...) but that one can certainly be prepared for. While not as fresh as the first two, this still works, with an appropriate and logical ending.<br/><br/>Should have ended the story here though..."
"ACMcC24","9","2","2","27 November 2003"," Amazingly much better than what I expected.
","*spoilers*<br/><br/>   Granted that originally I had suspicions as to why they really made a third Terminator, I must admit that I greatly regret waiting until this movie came out on DVD before seeing it.  The comments made by MM-39 very much sum up the movie perfectly.  <br/><br/>   Although -like the first two- you have a terminator/terminatrix sent back to destroy the eventual leader of the resistance, that's about where the similarities end.  Reality eventually sets in that the future is set for John, that war is unavoidable. There is no hope of change and John eventually understands the why of this and that there is no running from the responsibility/fate that's his.  Though the movie is sci-fi due to time travel, it becomes more believable with the involvement of very modern issues, concerning the threat of a virus infecting the series of networks that connect and in essence control the world's welfare.  Skynet, unaware that their creation is the cause of this world wide virus, unleashes it (ironically to destroy this virus).  In this, you see the beginnings of the machine wars, with it leaving the dead weight of hopelessness in your stomach, and the final scenes leaving you with the major sense of dread that you felt in the first Terminator.       <br/><br/>Arnold, reprising his protective role, isn't the fatherly type that he was in the 2nd.  Sent back by John's wife/2nd in command of the resistance, he is the cold machine who's sole purpose is to get John and his future wife to safety from the initial attack, while revealing a nasty piece of information to John about his future.  All around, I applaud Arnold for reprising this role, since it artfully filled in gaps left by the second movie.  So, overall, I'm more than pleased with #3 and have learned my lesson about assuming before seeing."

","In T3 the machines of the future want to wipe out the future resistance leader and his top people so they send a newer, even better terminator back in time. She was so undefeatable that I didn't know how they would survive the confrontations so it was different from T2 for that reason. I liked the movie and thought it was true to the series. Arnold looked great. Bringing the doctor back was a fun idea and I would have liked seeing Linda Hamilton in her role again. My only complaint was the John Connor character. He was portrayed as a weak hero.  7* out of 10*"
"Dodgablue99","9","2","2","2 July 2003"," Trailer doesn't do the Movie Justice
","My expectations for this film were extremely low.  I thought this movie would give Arnold's career a KO, but it didn't happen!  When I saw a couple of the trailers for the film, I thought it was going to be a joke.  C'mon Arnold playing a ""Terminator"" at 55 and coming a from heart surgery a few years ago?  I mean Arnold is still in great shape but he couldn't possibly pull it off, right?  Wrong!  Physically, Arnold showed that he could still pull off the action genre.  The only area where he looked aged was in his face (slightly receding hairline and receding eyebrows, along with a few wrinkles.)  For a 55 year old man, I would pray to look like him.<br/><br/>As for the movie, I truly believe it was the second best film in the trilogy.  Let's be real, T2 was probably the greatest action film of all time.  T3 came very close to surpassing the previous movie.  Along with a solid story, great stunts and special effects, I felt that the movie was money well spent!  After the bitterness of watching the Matrix: Reloaded, it felt good to see a an action movie with a decent plot.  Granted there are moments in the movie where some scenes and characters are hard to believe, but hey it's the movies!<br/><br/>My suggestion, go have great time watching a TRUE summer flick!"

The movie keeps you going and i was on the edge most of the time with the scenes in the movie.  I kid you not, take John Woo and Jerry Bruckhemier and put them together for a movie, this is what you'll have. Except....for one thing, one little thing i must mention is the charecter development.  There could've been a little more defintion of explaining of the characters, but if you saw the previous two movies, then there's really no need for the development.  This is the only thing i can think of that i could mention. Everything else about the movie was great, Arnold look great for being 55+ years old.  When you see him, I think he could do another 10 years of action movies.  I may sound crazy, but wait till you see him.

","Was I scared of this sequel!!!<br/><br/>Although i really liked Terminator 2, there were some aspects of the casting that greatly annoyed me. I found Edward Furlong and Linda Hamilton totally miscast for their roles. No such problem with T3. The casting is perfect. The story line is intelligent and goes way beyond what could be expected from a sequel. <br/><br/>The Terminatrix is truly steel cold and Arnold holds his own, with a slight touch of ""cabotinage"" (which could be roughly translated from french as ""hot-dogging""). The actors deliver... Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are totally credible in their roles (while, i must say it again, Furlong and Hamilton were not).<br/><br/>The effects are so seamless that we cannot see any CGI or mechanical effects, which is the mark of a great effort and success.<br/><br/>Jonathan Mostow does deliver similar results than J. Cameron. In a way, he doesn't have a signature style while Cameron has one that can sometimes be distracting. <br/><br/>In short, very honest work - a lot of bang for the buck. No oscar material but this is entertainment - and it sure is entertaining. It kills me that some people went into the next door theater to see ""28 days after"" (the king of the stinkers) instead of T3."
"CasterPawler","Null","11","20","14 April 2006"," The Terminator franchise is turning in its grave.
","Doesn't James Cameron's masterpiece, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, have a perfect ending? John, Sarah, and the Terminator manage to prevent Judgment Day by destroying Cyberdyne Systems and melting all the evidence that a Terminator ever existed. There's no way humanity will have to suffer through this war, right? WRONG! According to the professional idiots at Hollywood, Judgment Day is inevitable. Because without Judgment Day, there can be no sequels.<br/><br/>Well, the T-101 is back to promote his campaign for Governor! And the memorable characters you fell in love with from the previous installments are! Well, Sarah Connor's dead. Damn, that's a disappointment. Well, at least we've got Edward Furlong and no, wait. He's not in it. They replaced him with Nick Stahl. Well, Earl Boen's back as Dr. Peter Silberman! Funny I didn't remember him being in the third one. Maybe I should pay better attention.<br/><br/>Well, anyway, the machines decide it'd be a great idea to make the next Terminator model an attractive blonde. And they also apparently decide to ditch the numbers in favor of the much flashier T-X. You know, it sounds cooler, because the machines certainly care! I was infuriated at the lack of creativity in ""Judgment Day is inevitable."" Shouldn't you give an explanation as to HOW the exact same thing can be picked up if there's nothing any scientists can start from and the man who created the machines in the first place sacrificed himself to MAKE SURE his research never led to anything? Oh, wait. That would take away valuable explosion time. How silly of me.<br/><br/>Speaking of that, there's hardly any action in this movie. Hardly any GOOD action, anyway. There's a pretty cool chase scene in which the Terminator hangs on to a crane driven by the T-X. There's also a scene in which the Terminator blows away the police, but it's effectively ruined by the ""Human Casualties: 0"" thing. An obvious and pathetic attempt to make the audience believe this takes place in the Terminator storyline.<br/><br/>As for story well, if you ignore the numerous plot holes involving John Connor's age and the completely unrealistic idea of Judgment Day going off exactly as before, only later the story still sucks. The only interesting plot twist is the idea that the Terminator killed John Connor in the future. Kinda chills you when you hear that, but then you're immediately shaken out of the mood by Nick Stahl's incessant whining.<br/><br/>It ends abruptly and unsatisfyingly. It starts off good with the Terminator being controlled by the T-X. John Connor and his newfound love Kate Brewster rush frantically to prevent Judgment Day a second time, and you get a sense that it's going to be an exciting last- minute rescue of the human race. Unfortunately, the movie decides to spit in your face and set off Judgment Day anyway. Wow the entire point of Terminator 2, and also the main character's goal (apart from being a more annoying son-of-a-bitch than Anakin Skywalker, which was a huge accomplishment on his part) is reduced to nothing. No fate? Screw that, it's inevitable!<br/><br/>Terminator 1 was sad because Kyle dies at the end. Terminator 2 was sad because Arnold dies at the end. Terminator 3 is sad because the Termintor series dies at the beginning."
"the_oak","1","11","20","3 April 2006"," This film is a disgrace
","I have been a fan of Schwarzenegger for many years, and I have even money on him becoming president at odds 500/1. However, his last good film was True Lies. After this he had made a lot of garbage, probably being topped off with the enigma that is Terminator 3. What do you get when you have a lame script, a mediocre director and a lead actor that is not as hip as he used to be? The answer is a lame film. Another viewer rated the scene where he gets his clothes off a homosexual stripper a good one. I think it was very stupid, and totally destroyed any credibility that the terminator had built up in the first two outings. The rise of the machines and the almost total destruction of human kind is not a subject to me made fun of, and it is very sad that they did not understand this when they made T3. The T3 script is a mess. It is as if the script for Terminator 2 was a vase but it fell to the floor and broke and then a group of retards tried to glue the pieces together. I am a fan of Nick Stahl, and he was in my opinion one of the few that did a good job here. This is just very sad."
"TheWakingFalcoln","1","13","25","6 January 2008"," James Cameron had nothing to do with this...and you can tell.
","""The future is not set. There is No Fate but what we make for ourselves. I wish I could believe that...but I don't."" The very opening words of this movie set up the attitude that it has towards the two movies that came before it: ""Ya know those brilliant films that James Cameron created? We're gonna throw it all out the window."" Action movies are often not very memorable. The reason behind this, I believe, is because those involved forget about character and story in favor of special effects. They regard character and story, the two most important elements, as an unfortunate necessity in story structure to give their filmed action sequences some semblance of coherence.<br/><br/>James Cameron did what only a select few action movie directors have done: he remembered that character and story are what make the action memorable. The best action sequences are ones where you care about who's going to win, who's going to lose, who's going to survive, and who's going to die. You have to get your audience to care about the heroes so that the action actually has meaning beyond showing off your sky-high budget.<br/><br/>Like I said, so few directors actually remember that, especially as time goes on. Michael Bay forgot about that when he made TRANSFORMERS. Cory Yuen forgot about that when he made THE TRANSPORTER. And Jonathan Mostow forgot it in TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES.<br/><br/>The story's basic enough. John Connor didn't stop Judgement Day after all. He just postponed it.<br/><br/>There. That does it. Basically, the first two movies become meaningless with this movie around because they throw away the ""No Fate"" concept that was integral to the first two movies. But why is ""No Fate"" not true? Could they think of a logical, thought-provoking reason? No. The reason they came up with is, ""Because we need another movie."" <br/><br/>John Connor? Unlike Edward Furlong's portrayal, which showed a young, courageous, compassionate, intelligent, punk-attitude wiz kid who could easily be seen leading the Human Resistance years from now, Nich Stahl (a good actor with a bad script) shows a John Connor who cries and complains at every turn and does nothing remotely heroic throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>The Terminator? Although Arnold once created one of the most menacing villains in the history of the silver screen, and later a computer-programmed killer capable of learning and caring, here he is reduced to a one-line spouting source of ""comic"" relief.<br/><br/>I prefer to think that this tarnish to Cameron's legacy was never made."

Overall, there was so much action it wore me out but it was a worthy sequel to the last movie. If you enjoyed watching what the ""bad cyborg"" Robert Patrick could do in the ""Terminator 2,"" you'll really be entertained by his successor, played by Kristannia Loken. Like Patrick, she doesn't say much....but doesn't have to.

","Judged on its own merits, this movie is as forgettable as a thousand other forgettable action flicks: They come, stick around for a few weeks and they're gone. Who cares. However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.<br/><br/>Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.<br/><br/>And so on. 2/10."

","This was quite a relief.  The first movie was groundbreaking in its raw exploration of man vs. thinking machine, but there really wasn't much breadth to it - it centered around that concept alone.  The second movie was painful to watch, and I was afraid the third movie might go further down the road of dumb catch phrases and uninteresting sci-fi but instead, it was very well done.  As has already been mentioned, the action and effects are heart-pounding, and the visuals are dazzling, but the movie also raised questions about predestination and explored the means by which the robots were to eventually take over the world.  This provides substance for the movie and gives meaning to all of the action and excitement.  Add to that some well-placed humor and this movie is sure to satisfy Terminator fans everywhere!"

","Action movies usually don't manage to develop a deep and interesting storyline. And most of them don't even want to. That is fine, since there are a lot of people who like to watch an easy entertaining movie once in a while.<br/><br/>""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" proved that action movies can be so much more. Sometimes it would seem to you that incredible special effects don't let any financial room for a script (see ""Waterworld""), but T2 had it all: Awesome directing, award-winning special effects, a very becoming soundtrack, actors who did an incredible job (Linda especially) and a story that made it my all time favorite.<br/><br/>That is why Terminator 3 fails. The team might have produced a decent action movie a la ""Predator"", but in this case, they hit a whole franchise right in the face. The soundtrack is boring, the movie goes against principles that the first two laid out, the Terminator acts ridiculous, the pictures are nothing compared to the most of the time impressive and artistic scenes from T2.<br/><br/>Makes one wonder.. why was this movie even made? The ONLY reason is profit. I know that the goal of every movie is to make money, but if you can feel that there's no love for the project involved, it's crap.

"Jeremylamm04","1","12","24","1 August 2005"," Another sequel screwing up the first 2....
","When I first heard they were making Terminator 3 I shook my head in disgust. T2 is my favorite movie of all time and to top it would be impossible, not because Cameron is this all-mighty director, although he is very good, but that the movie was just done too well in T2. From the directing, acting, plot, the score, everything. T3 has none of these traits and that's what makes it a garbage movie.<br/><br/>I hate how Hollywood lets movies like this be created and ruin the image behind the first two completely. Just like the Alien movies, the first two were ruined by the memories of the last two. It's too bad that directors would rather make money than let people remember what the good movies stood for. <br/><br/>On to crap 3. <br/><br/>T3- First off, where is the music? The theme that the die-hard Terminator fans have known to love wasn't until the ending credits. Not that that makes a movie but I was looking forward to hearing it in the beginning. Not only that but there was a no music until about half-way in the movie it seemed like. It was just quiet and lame.<br/><br/>The beginning scene was total ridiculous. He goes into the male strip bar only to say talk to the hand and NOW! to his hand. It was so lame and a complete rip-off of the T2 bar scene.<br/><br/>The movie also have a very rush feeling to it to me. There was no character development what-so-ever. The love story didn't flow at all. Her fiancé is killed and she really didn't show any remorse or sadness that he was dead for more than a few seconds. When the Terminators first come together and the truck bounces over the girl I think I laughed out loud at how stupid that was. Not only that but the TX wasn't even scary to me and seemed less advanced than the T-1000. Robert Patrick was far more freaky as the creepy T-1000 than that girl ever was. Also, the T-1000 really couldn't be damaged. You could slow him down by freezing him or shooting but he always came back together because he was liquid. The TX was still metal underneath and could be damaged, which didn't seem more advanced to me. They couldn't come up with a better idea than the T-1000 though so they create this crap of combining the two Terminators into one. Retarded.<br/><br/>The humor in the movie was terrible and really took away from the Terminator feel in my opinion. The Terminator is supposed to be a killing machine, ruthless, relentless, careless. But this Terminator was cracking jokes and not really hurting anyone. In T2 it made sense but only because John was teaching him not to hurt people, and he still did. Also, when the Terminator was carrying the coffin and shooting at the police why didn't he kill anyone? Again, this made no sense because John didn't teach him not to do this so why didn't he kill anyone? I can't comprehend how people like this crap.<br/><br/>I think a major clue that the movie was going to suck before even seeing it was that it was rated PG-13. Any movie called ""Terminator"" should automatically be rated R. The other movies were more violent whereas this Terminator was a damn kids movie. Since when were Terminator movies supposed to be funny? What are they having the Terminator cracking jokes? In the second movie it made more sense because John was teaching the Terminator human speech. In this one he was just throwing out lines with no one teaching him anything. I wanted to throw a knife at the screen this movie was so bad.<br/><br/>One thing that I didn't get is that all of a sudden in this Terminator film he can crash through pretty much any wall, smash marble, get beaten to a pulp and he is fine, not to mention put his head back on after it was knocked off which makes no sense, and fight his programming. The film was complete garbage and frankly I'm shocked that as many people liked it as I see on this board. I read people said he was a different model from the other Terminators, but when did they ever explain that in T3? Makes no sense.<br/><br/>I have a theory that most people enjoy crap movies with no plot and just mindless action. Sadly, this is true because people would rather be entertained than have to think and this is a prime examples of that. Just like many people liked the trashy movie Independece Day because it ""kept your attention"", the same people like T3 because of the lame car chase, or the fight scene between the TX and the Terminator.<br/><br/>I watched the making of T2 and Cameron had first written the script to have T2 as the final Terminator. The beginning scenes were actually Conner and team taking over Skynet and destroying it and finding unused 101's, and that's when he sent it back in time. However, that was cut due to run time of the movie. I for one am going to pretend T3 does not exist and that they did in fact stop the war in T2 because I can's stand the idea of T3. I wish I could go back in time and stop this movie from being created. I give it -10 out of 10. Utter garbage."

T1 and 2 despite their sci-fi fantasy still adhered to real life rules such as big metal robot hitting walls will cause damage, not in T3. We've all seen a Terminator endo-skeleton and the pistons controlling the neck and head so how does Arnie put his head back on after the TX lops it off?<br/><br/>T1 and 2 were classic thought provoking films that reminded you of the fragility of human life and made you feel sad about the state of the world, T3 has none of this, instead relying on action and dumb jokes that are out of place.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a film matching the quality of the previous installments then you'll be disappointed, if you just want an easy to watch mindless action movie then enjoy.<br/><br/>2/10"

It combines the relentless pace of the first film with the clever twists, emotional sensibilities and grand visuals of the second one, while it actually moves the story forward towards the unavoidable (?) end, unlike Terminator 2 (which I also like).<br/><br/>Interestingly, Terminator 3 manages to be visceral and funny (oh, those sunglasses! - the humorous takes on the iconic moments from the first two films work especially well), light-hearted (almost family-friendly) and grimly pessimistic at the same time. So far, it is the only instalment in the series where there is no happy ending. Hope, yes, but humanity does fall here, nevertheless. You cannot escape your destiny.<br/><br/>Kristanna Loken is wonderful in the role of the merciless terminatrix (kudos for the costume designers for her leather dress), as is Claire Danes as Kate Brewster, especially when she unleashes her anger. The all-wrecking car chase through the city didn't impress me much at the time, but has become one of my favourite action sequences since. All in all, highly rewatchable, great entertainment."
"lewis-51","8","5","8","17 December 2008"," a very fine movie in the best sci-fi series
","As if we needed another comment, here I go with a brief one.<br/><br/>An awful lot of people have written comments panning this movie. I think they are nuts. This is a very fine movie, and a very fine part 3 in the saga. Danes and Stahl are excellent. There is good character development. The occasional humor was excellent. The chase scene with the crane vehicle was superb -- maybe the best chase scene I've ever seen. I've seen this movie at least 3 times, but that chase scene always keeps me on edge and gasping, probably because it's believable. Yes, I know that isn't really what would have happened if the hook had caught on something down in a manhole, but so what? It's a movie for goodness sake. <br/><br/>Other critics here have compared T3 unfavorably to The Matrix. Sorry, this movie is far better than the Matrix. Half the time I couldn't figure out what was going on in The Matrix. The fight scenes with the slow motion figures pivoting around are just silly and unbelievable. Furthermore, the basic premise of the Matrix series of movies is unbelievable. The events here in the Terminator movies are much more plausible, like good science fiction always is. The Matrix is more like fantasy, almost like Harry Potter (ugh).<br/><br/>No, it's not as good as T2, but so what? It's still very very good.<br/><br/><ul><li>henry</li></ul>"

","first of all im a die hard terminator fan i have been since i saw T-2 when i was 5 i saw T3 in theaters i thought it was OK i was expecting something a little better but anyways what i don't get is why they would send something less advanced than the t-1000 the T-x is cool (and hot) don't get me wrong but the thing is an anti-terminator and if she would try to attempt to terminate the t-1000 she would fail because she would shoot him with that ray gun she has and it would go through him and the t-1000 would basically do what he did to the T-800 (arnie) in the end of T2 which is completely F@#K him up so yeah thats what i really didn't like about that movie does anyone else agree?"
"db984","8","5","8","30 November 2003"," Solid Sequel
","Overall I liked it better than T2. The acting was better, the special effects were par, and the script was better. It hits more than it misses.<br/><br/>My only complaint would be the TX, which wasn't as interesting or as well done as the T-1000 (of T2). But Arnold's T-101 was much better this time out, and the movie was much improved by losing the 'punk kid' version of John Conner and Sarah Conner's character.<br/><br/>One of the better Arnold movies, and a worthy Terminator sequel."
"caramelos","10","5","8","6 September 2003"," The T-X
","I think one of the best things about about T3 was Kristanna Loken, even if she did have less lines and things to do than the other evil terminators, she still did very very well with what she was given. Personally I think she did a great job. If they make a T4 I hope she is in it but with a bigger role. I also thought that Nick Stahl was quite good. He seemed to come across as quite vunerable though which I wasn't expecting and after a few years on the run you'd think he'd be a little less naive (for lack of a better word). All in all I really loved this movie, I saw it twice in the cinema and would go again if I could. I can't wait for the DVD, I'd like to see some deleted scenes... maybe there were a lot of ones that Kristanna had that were deleted which would explain why she wasn't as scary as the other evil ones. Actually because she had less to do I felt her character more as a ""human"" than a terminator. She really did try to get her missions done and she did manage to kill the other leaders so she wasn't all bad. And for someone who hasn't done any major body training in a while, Arnie toned up pretty good, but if they get around to making a fourth film... if the timing is going the same way it has been (one a decade) hes going to be more than 65 years old by the time they make it! Claire Danes could have had more of a role... and I really want to know, in the trailer, what's the name of the music right before the end? I think it's the third piece of music to be played (when Kristanna is programming the robot) because I like that piece of music very much."

","There is no point on this topic, really... I just wanted to express the fact that i laughed my *** out of the ""talk to the hand"" gag - on both times. Also, those star-ultra-gay glasses that Arnold first takes are making me laugh till now. Damn funny..."
"moviefan69","9","5","8","3 July 2003"," Yes naysayers, it IS better than T2!!!
","They said it couldn't be done. No James Cameron. No Linda Hamilton. No Edward Furlong. Arnold well past his prime, both physically, and as a box-office powerhouse. All the early buzz indicated a disaster. But I knew, I felt it in my bones, that this film would be great. Why? Because too many people said it couldn't be done. It's always the way it works. When hype builds a movie up, and everyone is expecting too much (ala Matrix Reloaded), everyone is bound for a letdown. When all hope seems lost, and everyone's expectations are at their lowest, are we then surprised. So thank you all you T3 bashers, you have made me look like prophet! Terminator 3 is not only the best movie so far this summer, it stands head and shoulders above Terminator 2! It actually benefits from Cameron, Hamilton, and Furlong being absent. Camerson has become a Titanic-hugging hacked that peaked years ago. Terminator 1, Aliens, and The Abyss are all masterpieces. He's been on a downhill slide ever since. Sorry Motion Picture Academy, but Titanic sucked the big one. Someone tell me what Linda Hamilton has done besides the Terminator films that is worth watching......I'm waiting.....Thought so. She may have morphed from a whiny waitress, to a female Rambo, but there was nothing else for that character to do. Besides, for all her toughness in T2, she was a much more interesting character in the original. Finally, don't get me started on Edward Furlong. In T2, he was a whiny little bitch that I wished would get killed. He tried to come across as tough, but Furlong is such a bad actor, that he was laughable. T2 also relied too heavily on it's ""ooh"" and ""aahh"" fx. Yes they were spectacular and innovative, but it was too cool to be threatening. Now this is not to say that I didn't like T2. I did. Just not nearly as much as the first. Now comes T3 and the series has been given an incredible kick start. Kudos to the director, Jonathan Mostow. It is my opinion that Mr. Mostow is one of the hottest directors working today. His previous films, Breakdown and U-571, both breathed new life into their respective genres, and T3 is no exception. Mostow does not attempt to be Cameron, and the movie is all the better for it. Mostow brings his own style to the table, and the results are spectacular. The cinematography, editing, and pacing are all top notch. And the action sequences? Incredible! There is a vehicle chase at the beginning of this movie (I hesitate to say ""car chase"" because cars don't really factor into it, unless they are getting demolished) that is awe inspiring. This is what the chase in Matrix Reloaded WANTED to be. It ranks as one of the best chase scenes in movie history. Right up there with The French Connection and The Road Warrior. There is also a brawl between the T-101 and T-X in a public restroom that goes all out. Great stuff. Now what would this movie be without characters? Nick Stahl is PERFECT as John Connor. Now a tortured soul, too torn up by the past to be hopeful of the future, Stahl let's it all hang out. He let's you feel everything Connor does. Hoping for the best, but all the while you feel that fate is going to catch up with you sooner or later. Claire Danes, who I have never been a big fan of, also shines. She is in full Linda Hamilton mode, but better. She is a caring person, but proves that she's tough as nails when the chips are down. Bravo, Ms. Danes. Arnold. What can I say about the man? He may have been away from the character for 10 years, but you'd never know it. Arnold is the Terminator. Now doubts about it. Welcome back Mr. Schwarzenegger, you've been gone too long. Now as for Arnold's nemesis, we have Kristanna Loken as the T-X. Quite simply she, with the exception of Mostow, had the most work cut out for her in this movie. Everyone know what to expect from Arnold. But it is a rule of action movies that they are only as good as their villian. Robert Patrick had the benefit of brand-new CG technology to back him up. While his performance was good, (Especially how he NEVER blinks his eyes while firing a gun. I'd like to see you try that. If you've never noticed, watch T2 and check it out) as I said before, the effects made him more cool than threatening. Now we have Ms. Loken. People scoffed at the idea of a female Terminator to begin with. SO the deck was really stacked against her. Well have no fear, the T-X is here, and she is as bad-ass as they come. Not only can she go toe-to-toe with Arnie, not only can she morph like the T-1000, but she has more than a few tricks up her sleeve. She can reprogram machines, manufature weapons from her arm, and remote control vehicles to really give you a run for your money. She is also one of the most INCREDIBLY beautiul women you will ever see. That adds to her manace, because she has the power of a woman's seductivness on her side, and believe me she uses it. Her beaufiul, icy stare is at once mesmerizing, and terrifying when you realize what is behind those eyes. Way to go Kristanna. Everyone gives their all. The director, actors, and the FX department. But unlike T2, they don't overuse the CG effects. They utilize many styles. GC, miniature work, makeup fx, mechanical effects, and good old-fashioned stunt work. As I said earlier, the chase scene is incredible. Even more so when you realize how much of it was done for real. Simply spectacular. What this movie also has, unlike T2, is the tension of the original film. In T2, you simply dont care about the people. They are only backdrop to the action and fx. Not so here. The makers realized that the characters needed to be as flushed out as the action. That brings the tension level up ten fold. Just like the original. So is it as good as the original? No. But then it couldn't be. So it doesn't try to be. BUT it is a damn great movie, and a big improvement over T2. The best praise I can give it is....BRING ON TERMINATOR 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"caseynicholson","8","3","4","29 August 2015"," Shocked By How Much I Liked This Twelve Years Later!
","I remember being very disappointed when this movie came out. The first two Terminator movies have always been some of my favorite movies, or at least they were when I was more of a youth. Indeed, for many years I would have said that ""T2: Judgment Day"" was my favorite film.<br/><br/>I guess I've grown up a fair bit since then, because I've been watching the series this past week, and while I still have a great love for T1, T2 failed to impress me the way I imagined it would after not having seen it for several years. And then tonight I got around to ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"". I prepared myself to be let down. This is, after all, the worst of the series (I still haven't seen Salvation or Genesis). So I settled in waiting to be unimpressed.<br/><br/>To my great surprise, twelve years after having first watched this film in the theater, I found this movie to be a lot better than anything I expected to find. Indeed, I'm rating it higher than I rated T2 (7 stars--after having given T1 a perfect 10).<br/><br/>So why did this movie work for me on a second viewing? Perhaps it was because when I saw it the first time my expectations were very high whereas today they were very low. Or perhaps my relative displeasure with how T2 has held up for me made T3 a better movie. <br/><br/>What I do know is that this film nailed its action sequences quite well--the long scene with the crane truck is pretty awesome if you ask me. And the female Terminator (whatever model number she is) was neater this time around. Clare Danes does a great job as supporting actress in this movie, and whereas I was expecting the plot and script to be weak overall, I actually felt that it arguably did a better job of advancing the story of the franchise than T2 did.<br/><br/>All that said, I'm giving this movie 8/10 stars. It greatly exceeded my expectations for a lazy day Blu Ray movie. Definitely worth giving another shot if you haven't seen it since it came out."
"The Grand Master","7","3","4","4 February 2015"," Great to see the Terminator again, but not a memorable classic compared to the previous Terminator movies
","After 12 long years, the Terminator is back. Between 1991 and 2003 there were many rumours surrounding a possible Terminator 3 with James Cameron at the helm and the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger. However, with many ideas going flat as well as possible adversaries to beat the T-1000 (one magazine in 1995 suggested Shaquille O'Neal was going to be the next Terminator to go up against Arnold) however nothing eventuated, particularly with Carolco Pictures going bankrupt in 1996. A lot of Terminator fans were eagerly looking forward to see a new Terminator sequel. Terminator fans had their prayers answered when Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was released in 2003. I thought Terminator 3 was a good movie and a worthy sequel, but overall was not great. To be fair, it was certainly going to be a hard act to follow. Given that Terminator 2: Judgement Day was a huge blockbuster that set the benchmark for all movies, Terminator 3 had a lot to live up to.<br/><br/>Following the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day, we learn that Judgement Day did not eventuate on August 29 1997 however John Connor (Nick Stahl who has taken over from Edward Furlong) has since disappeared of the grid. His mother Sarah Connor has since passed away from leukaemia, John does small jobs from time to time and lives as a drifter around Los Angeles. John still lives in fear that Skynet may track him down and kill him. Unable to find John Connor, Skynet sends back the T-X (Kristanna Loken), an female Terminator with an advanced prototype succeeding its predecessors with built-in weaponry within its endoskeleton, a liquid metal exterior similar to the T-1000, and the ability to re-program other machines. The T-X is sent back to terminate John Connor's future lieutenants and other members of the human resistance. Another objective of the T-X is to terminate John Connor's future wife and second in command Katherine Brewster (Claire Danes). To protect and ensure the survival of John Connor, a new Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back by the human resistance to prevent the T-X from successfully completing her mission. At the same time, Katherine Brewster's father who is a high ranking US Air Force Officer General Robert Brewster (David Andrews) has taken over from Miles Dyson's work from Cyberdyne Systems is linking up the US Military computers to a program called Skynet to run the entire US Military system. The Terminator, John Connor and Katherine Brewster must race against time to prevent the T-X from successfully completing its mission, and to prevent the nuclear war.<br/><br/>Jonathon Mostow (U-571, Breakdown) takes over from James Cameron who declined to take the director's chair. Though Jonathon Mostow does a good job and he remains faithful to the previous Terminator movies, he still does not have the same magic touch as James Cameron. It was good to see various references to previous Terminator movies, but in terms of action it was certainly not going to outdo the previous Terminator movies. Terminator 2: Judgement Day certainly expanded on the first Terminator movie, whereas in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines it continues on the legacy by bringing forth new ideas.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in his iconic role as the Terminator. Though Arnold Schwarzenegger was 54 years old at the time of filming, he still has the Midas touch, one-liners and all. It was a thrill to see Arnold Schwarzenegger return as the Terminator. It was also the last starring role for Arnold Schwarzenegger before being elected as the Governor of California.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl was uninspiring as John Connor came across as a bit wimpy and was came across as a geek compared to Edward Furlong who had a lot more guts with his character and possessed a strong personality as John Connor, somebody with backbone who had the potential to be a future leader of the human resistance. Unfortunately Edward Furlong was missed as John Connor, however was dropped from his famous role due to substance abuse problems.<br/><br/>Kristanna Loken as the T-X did not have the same intimidation factor as the first Terminator and the T-1000, but she was just met the standard as a worthy adversary in this movie. She barely has any speaking parts as well.<br/><br/>Claire Danes as Katherine Brewster came across as very mature and was someone that stood up and fought back rather than come across as a helpless damsel in distress. She moves on from her past roles such as Romeo and Juliet (1996) to portray John Connor's future wife and a strong willed second in command.<br/><br/>Earl Boen reprises his role in a brief cameo as Dr Peter Silberman from the previous Terminator movies. Though it was only one scene, it was great to see the famous Dr Silberman return in one scene.<br/><br/>As previously mentioned some of the action scenes in the movie were not as memorable compared to the previous Terminator movies. The crane pursuit through downtown Los Angeles wasn't bad but didn't exactly outdo the action scenes in the previous Terminator movies which were a classic and kept audiences excited. The climax where the machines take over the Air Force base was the most exciting part of the movie.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was always going to be a hard act to follow compared to its predecessors but it is certainly a worthy entry into the Terminator series. I was also glad that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines didn't have the violence watered down, although it was noticeably less violent. Though Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was not a memorable classic compared to The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, it left me satisfied well enough that it was good to see the Terminator blast onto our screens once again.<br/><br/>7/10."
"tburke85","4","3","4","1 June 2009"," Terminator 3 An Okay Sc-Fi Film But Flawed
","Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines is a disappointment compared to the sequel that came before it T2 Judgment Day. Terminator 3 is an okay sci-film but flawed in many ways. Director Jonathan Mostow (U571) does a decent job of bringing this movie to the big screen but it could've been a lot better. Some action scenes are cool including a chase sequence early on but the dialgoue at times isn't the greatest which made the movie kind of corny. It's basically the same plot of the first film about a time-traveling terminator whose been sent to protect John Connor from another advanced cyborg except this time it's a woman known as the terminatrix. Whose idea was it to make the villain a female terminator? No offense to Kristina Loken who played the villain because she did do a good job in the movie but I just couldn't buy Skynet creating a female terminator. No offense. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns for the third time as another T-800 sent from the future to protect the soon to be leader of the resistance John Connor. Swarzenegger was born to play The Terminator and does a great job with the role but even he can't help this movie from being a disappointment. His talent and mostly everyone else's is wasted in this third adventure of the Terminator series that's basically the same story of the first two films. It offers nothing really new and besides for some cool action sequences and special effects the movie just isn't that good compared to the other three films. Nick Stahl from Bully and In The Bedroom plays Connor this time taking over for Edward Furlong. Stahl gives a solid performance of an off the grid bum who's running from a destiny he can not escape. Claire Danes from The Mod Squad and Stardust plays Kate Brewster who will eventually become Connor's wife in the future and his second in command. Danes is believable as Kate whose world is turned upside down after she has a chance encounter with Connor. The rest of the cast are good in their roles but this one is the worst of the fourth films in the Terminator series. It's not really that bad as far as the action/fight sequences, special effects, and most of the acting goes it just could've been a lot better at least to me. If you're a fan of these type of films and you haven't seen any other the terminator films yet. I suggest you see either the first one, Judgement Day, or the one that came out most recently Terminator Salvation with Christian Bale and Sam Worthington. Now those three films are worth watching unfortunately I can't say the same for this one."
"johnnyboyz","6","3","4","17 May 2009"," Healthy and well executed continuation of the series, not submitting to genre convention while exploring its leads in an impressive manner.
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines seems to hold up for me, on subsequent viewings. I took to it the first time I saw it, and have since been quite surprised by the level of antagonism most people have toward it. The film is far from the disaster it could have been; it draws on inspiration from the previous two films and rather than aim to go bigger and better, it actually opts to go underneath them – this, it most certainly achieves. Drawing on the fast moving element of chase and the very bleak atmosphere the first film had, Terminator 3 delivers as a downbeat and briskly paced thriller with a science-fiction twist. It additionally works as a polished action film, something the second Terminator film was, with numerous action set pieces but with additional substance in the form of studies of individuals and their hardened bodies. Unlike the second film, however, which offered hope at the end of the narrative; Terminator 3 sticks to its guns and concludes on a downbeat tone, echoing the first film and setting up what will be a supposed number of sequels.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people dislike the film because they're told to dislike the film; almost as if people are frightened of reading too much into the text. Yes, Cameron had no input to its production; yes, the enemy Terminator is a female; yes, Schwarzenegger's 'good' Terminator is a lot less sympathetic and there's a smaller focus on man and machine co-existing, but so what? The film remains an interesting character piece, establishing would-be hard bodied heroes and fleshing them out. On the other strand, it tells the tale of a certain military individual by name of Lieutenant General Robert Brewster (Andrews) and his final developments, along with the United States Air Force, of a complicated new weapons system they inherited from Cyberdyne Systems following their destruction in the second film. Brewster jokingly, but ominously, talks about how he wants to keep humans and their decisions 'in the loop' when it comes to co-existing with machines.<br/><br/>The film begins with a now adult John Connor (Stahl), a nobody, an everyday guy whom does some work here and there; drifts on his motorcycle; rues the death of his mother Sarah and sits atop high bridges late at night with a beer, quite possibly contemplating suicide. The first glimpses of this individual goes against the more typical image of an action genre lead: John is weak and a relative nobody, whilst possesses very few skills. He will once again get put through the survival grinder as Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his third innings as his career defining role, is sent back to 2003 to protect him from a more advanced enemy robot named the T-X (Loken), a female super-assassin who is five times the antagonist the T-1000 was in terms of both power and ability. Like Robert Patrick's role, and to a degree Schwarzenegger's in the first film, the film opts for a relative unknown in Kristanna Loken who pulls off her role with the same anonymity and menace as her predecessors.<br/><br/>Going through the grinder with John and the T-850 Terminator is Kate Brewster (Danes), the daughter of the aforementioned Robert of high military importance. Kate is the film's secondary study of a would-be hard bodied character; she successfully goes from squealing, screaming veterinarian to miniature Hunter Killer destroyer-come-soldier in what is a moment of realisation by both characters that she is of that material – those that groan in disappointment at this occurrence are those that have completely missed the study in transition, thus going back to what I say about people being afraid to read too much into it. Much earlier on, she additionally displays a hardened attitude when she outsmarts John, mistaking him for a junkie breaking into the veterinarian hospital, and locks him in an animal cage. Kate advances, emotionally, as she looses those she loves and becomes more weary of the situation.<br/><br/>The T-X acts as an interesting element to the film. The filmmakers have not updated the 'role' of the antagonistic robot purely to be different and offer variation in the role. Rather, they have allowed the most powerful character in the entire film to be a woman, something that is relatively unheard of in today's action genre. Equally refreshing is the refraining from turning both the T-X and Kate into objects of desire, forever developing and fleshing out one as the other ponders a woman's role in the new world she been transported back to when she observes a bra advertisement board asking us 'What is Sexy?' For those out for the set pieces, the film includes a few scenes of great action: the initial coming together of the robotic forces and the ensuing escape/acquiring of Kate and John as well as a shootout and consequent escape at a cemetery, during which Earl Boen gets an amusing cameo. The Terminator and the TX have an additional hand-to-hand fight in a public bathroom. <br/><br/>The film is, essentially, a tragedy rather than a glorification of violence or a fetishisation of explosions. It documents mankind's inability to come to terms with the weapons they have at their disposal and modernity in general. I find Terminator 3 to be interesting in its own right, and worthy of a place on the mantle amongst the first two, but to echo Sarah Connor's words as she journeys to destroy the Cyberdyne building in Terminator 2: furthering the franchise into the future is 'a venture into the unknown, a making up of history as we go along'. It may yet prove to be futile and a bit of a miss-judgement and that, like judgement day, money-making sequels to established franchises ""are inevitable""."

All I wanted was a good continuation of the story line mixed with some decent action. And that's exactly what I got. (Which is more than I can say for the Matrix 2 and 3)<br/><br/>I think the best change from the last movie to this one is the recasting of John Connor. Nick Stahl did a pretty good job, and it was a hell of a lot better than Edward ""I'm Strung Out On Everything In Existence"" Furlong could ever do. Claire Danes was good, even with her Laura Bush haircut and Arnold was...well, Arnold.<br/><br/>A few minor plot holes aside, I recommend watching this if you are a fan of the first two."

","After seeing the first two terminator films I couldn't wait to see the third installment in the franchise that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a hit. T3 lives up to the reputation of the previous movies with more special effects and action sequences than before.10 years have passed since John Connor (Stahl) helped to blow up Cyberdyne Systems and stop judgment day now 23 years old he lives a quiet existence, no credit cards, phone, address or home. He is trying to escape the future and his destiny meanwhile a new terminator called the T-X (Loken) has been sent to eliminate his lieutenants including Kate Brewster (Danes) who will be an important part of the resistance and later become John's wife.

","I must be the only person in the world who believes T3 is better than the first two movies, but I stand by my opinion. The first two Terminator movies were great and definitely action classics, and the 3rd one really takes the ball and gives this series a slam dunk. The action is crisp and well filmed. The dialogue is sensible, both serious and half-mocking. Lastly, the storyline did not disappoint, as often is the case in sequels of this scale (ex. the Matrix movies). The casting in this movie at first threw me off, but eventually the new characters fit into the timeline. The female terminator is also another reason to check out T3 many times. All in all, T3 is a benchmark for 21st century action movies."

""Rise Of The Machines"" definetly has flaws... but nothing overly glaring in my opinion (with the exception of the whole ""talk to the hand"" bit).<br/><br/>Top notch action (no denying the utter sweetness of that first chase in downtown L.A.), impressive visuals, and a solid story. It may not have alot in the way of character development ... mainly because there's never much time for any of the characters to be sitting still for more than a few minutes.<br/><br/>The feeling of this movie is very urgent. Lots of chasing and little to no pausing. Very quick pacing -- even more so than the other films in the series. Characters are ALWAYS in motion.<br/><br/>I have been waiting since July 91 for another installment -- and I really believe this is a worthy entry in a great series of films. It may not be as memorable as the first two... but its still much more entertaining than alot of the action dreck that comes from Hollywood now-a-days.<br/><br/>The Terminator - 8/10<br/><br/>Judgment Day - 9/10<br/><br/>Rise Of The Machines - 7/10"
"carlabrams","8","3","4","6 January 2004"," Comments about Nick Stahl as John Connor
","I've read some of the comments here about how Nick Stahl just didn't work for people as John Connor.  I just rewatched the movie again on DVD and I think I've figured it out.  They tuned out the characters.<br/><br/>Think about what kind of life John Connor had to have while growing up - his Mom is in an insane asylum until he's 10/13.  So he's part of the foster care system.  Then all of a sudden he finds out all the BS that he's heard about himself is true - and it's all with a vengeance.  It's not like these activities take place over months - it's a couple of days for everything from T2 and that's it.  Then he lives with him Mom in Mexico until she dies.<br/><br/>Now he's alone - ALL alone.  What kind of life would YOU make for yourself? 17 - you've watched your Mom die from leukemia (which is not a great thing to see in and of itself) - and you're told that when most of humanity is killed in a nuclear holocaust, that you're the leader of the survivors. Think that YOU might be a little bent out of shape and quite possibly not strong enough to take it?  Maybe even crawl into a bottle, or just run away from everything?<br/><br/>That's what John did - as is shown at the start of the movie.  By the time he's hooked up with Arnold in the crypt, he's sick of it.  From his perspective, this is an intense amount of pressure to put on someone.  You HAVE to live, no matter what.  That's why at the end of the movie Kate Brewster (who has also had a REALLY rotten 13 hours, when you think about it - she shows up at the vet clinic at 0530 for what she thinks is a routine, albeit annoying emergency call, and by 1820 hours, she's been beat up, kidnapped, shot at, her fiance is dead, her father is dead, and told she's going to be the wife of John Connor and oh, yeah, she's the one who sent Arnie back in time because John is dead in the future - that's one HELL of a day) and John Connor have grown so much in character from the start of the movie."

"strogger","10","3","4","10 August 2003"," Exciting return to the Terminator series.
","T3 surprises in the strength of its story. Most problems with the film lay not in the script. Where T3 fails to live up to its predecessors is mainly in a visual/technical sense. The lighting, framing, editing and music is not up to the level of T2, visually the film lacks drama and makes one long for the artistry that was created through the collaboration of James Cameron and Adam Greenberg. The films design is also not as striking or convincing as T2. The effects are good if not groundbreaking. The film also lacks the epic feel which it should have considering the subject matter. Unfortunately most of the record breaking budget must have been used settling various legal problems. But despite all this the film is great fun, Arnie is amazing and has some good and surprisingly clever lines. Though the film does lack the epic feel this results in a fast paced film that never drags and really makes you wish it were longer. The main chase sequence and bathroom brawl are amazing to behold. Overall, if the first two get a ten this one gets an 8. See it on the big screen!"
"Logan_5","10","3","4","30 July 2003"," Ready for Terminator 4
","Wow, this was a great show. Finally a movie that capitalizes on Arnies' strengths as an actor. This third installment really caps the Terminator Saga as well as advances the entire story.  I loved the movie and the characters again."
"LennyRenquist","9","3","4","18 July 2003"," Hype terminates movies...
","...but strangely, in the lead-up to T3, I didn't encounter ANY of the saturation advertising. I heard about it: ""Hey, have you seen the trailer for T3? That T-X looks sooooo hot!"" But somehow it passed me by. The only hype I encountered was in my own mind. And that was mostly concern that it might suck. I was afraid Arnie might be past it. I was afraid the lack of Cameron panache might result in a lame sequel, rather than a great new instalment in a great series. But then I thought: That T-X looks sooooo hot! So I went to see it.<br/><br/>And I'm glad I did. This is no epic like T2. But it's definitely a worthy addition to the franchise. It's more reminiscent of T1, in that it's like a low-budget, B-grade sci-fi actioner. With a bit of a brain. And a HUGE budget. My kind of movie.<br/><br/>To my mind, the biggest (well, only) flaw with T2 was that Jim unwittingly created a sort of paradox. To wit: No Cyberdyne = No Skynet = No War = No Terminator = No Kyle Reece Time Travel Caper = No John Connor = No End To Cyberdyne = Skynet = War = Machines Win. Oops.<br/><br/>T3, in explaining its premise (or justifying its existence) sort of solves this paradox. But in so doing, it creates a new one, concerning John's message to his mother in T1, the philosophy which becomes her driving force in T2. Maybe he was just being cheeky, seeing what crazy things his words might make her do. But then, maybe not.<br/><br/>On top of introducing a new philosophical slant to proceedings, the folks behind T3 have expanded the story and introduced new characters, while keeping the cast quite small.<br/><br/>The action sequences are AWESOME. One chase, involving a crane, a fire engine and several police cars, is one of the most spectacular (not to mention EXPENSIVE-LOOKING) I have seen in recent times. Mostly because there appear to be few visual effects involved. Not to mention HEAPS of wrecked cars.<br/><br/>Arnie may be getting on, but he is still the Terminator. His skin may sag a little, but he's an old model. Surely Terminators get wrinkles. No-one else can punch through a wall like Arnie.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl is fine as an older John Connor. I like the way the character is introduced. A lot has happened to him since he helped stop Judgement Day. And he's the worse for it. He starts out a little frazzled, then gets MORE frazzled as the situation escalates. Nick portrays this well.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I had reservations about Claire Danes being in this movie, as it's not in keeping with her usual...thing. But she's playing a character who isn't used to being hunted by an evil robot (who is?), so it works out nicely. She plays frightened well.<br/><br/>And Kristanna Loken? What can I say? You can keep your Xenia Onatopp and your Mystique. There's a new femme fatale in town. And she's a toughie, too. She has a grenade launcher in her hand! Literally! She can throw ARNIE around the room like a RAGDOLL! How can you beat that? The T-X is a clever combination of the solid T-101 (Arnie) and the liquid T-1000 (Robert Patrick). With boobs. Sheer genius.<br/><br/>I went in expecting a lame action movie about an old man in leather. What I got was a surprisingly good (REALLY good) Terminator movie, that left me wanting a T4.<br/><br/>Is it inevitable? The future will decide..."
"moviedude1","9","3","4","12 July 2003"," T1 & T2 COMBINED ON STEROIDS!
","I just saw T3 tonight and I think the one line summary is about all that needs to be said about it: T1 & T2 on steroids.  This movie will live in the trilogy.  It follows the story line enough that the true Terminator fans can make the easy predictions as far as what's going to happen or be said next, but Ms Loken does exactly what the character is supposed to do: keep coming until the job is finished.<br/><br/>Arnold, on the other hand, once again, plays the good guy in this film.  And although I could not see him as a bad guy like he was in the first Terminator, he was a good guy who could make it believable!  Nick Stahl is an unknown to me.  I have never seen him perform before, to my knowledge, but his character portrayal is not bad!  The whole film plot is enough to make someone think, though, about two things:  1) The events that lead to the eventual destruction of mankind, & 2) the fact that someone's destiny can be changed, but weather the timeline can follow pretty much the same path or not.<br/><br/>Sci fi strikes again in the summer of 2003.  I rate this a 9! I really enjoyed watching this film!"
"tehkao","9","3","4","8 July 2003"," Very fast paced action plus a good story
","Terminator 3 is a very effective, tightly edited, and polished action movie. You feel that every second of the 109 minutes of this film was used effectively and not wasted. There is very little ""downtime"". There is always something important going on or being said.<br/><br/>A lot has been said about the humor in this movie. Some think it's too much and ruins the dark ""feel"" that Terminator movies are supposed to have, but others don't mind the humor as much. I'm sort of on the fence on this one. On one hand I find the humor very clever and well done, but on the other hand it seems out of place in a movie that deals with such a dark theme and storyline (the end of the world). But in a way the occasional jokes help alleviate the overall gloomy mood of the film.<br/><br/>The movie is also a contrast of two parts: the first hour is full of one liners and gags, but the 2nd half is deadly serious and even depressing.<br/><br/>But the bottom line is, the movie keeps you entertained throughout and I think that's the most important thing. It also tells a very crucial chapter in the whole Terminator ""saga"", that of the genesis of Skynet and the ""rise of the machines"". It's a story that was begging to be told ever since Terminator 2, and I'm so glad we finally got it and it was executed so brilliantly. The ending was also surprisingly more emotional and touching than I ever expected.<br/><br/>Compared to its predecessors T1 and T2, I give T3 a very respectable 8 out of 10. Comparing it to most modern action movies, I give it a 10 out of 10. T3 is a throwback to the glory days of sci-fi action movies of the 80's and 90's. It's filled with one-liners, tells an engrossing story, pays attention to detail, while throwing in a lot of gratuitous explosions and destruction."

terminator 3 though...this has been the best and most enjoyable action movie this summer.  the story - for how little attention they gave it - worked just fine and was easily understandable.  no need to see it a second time to figure out what the hell they're talking about.  i'll see it again just because it was sooooooooooooo freaking enjoyable!  i mean hulk?  matrix? even x2!  these aren't action movies!  terminator 3 is an action movie, best one i've seen in a while.  suspense!  there was actual suspense!  yeah! and the end?  oh no!  very good, good stuff.  i will take it personally when people say they didn't like this movie.  i will defend it.  take note of the small details in this movie.  they're important, and they ARE there.  ""it would've been soooo much better if cameron had directed it.""  comparisons are stupid.  just because it's a franchise doesn't mean you should compare directors.  except if it's george lucas, who somehow screwed his own franchise by being the director. let me direct episode 3."

","I've read some other reviews of T3 (not necessarily here on IMDB) that are not favorable at all. I just don't understand this at all. Being a fan of the original Terminator and T2 I found the third installment appropriate and extremely entertaining. Every movie has it's downspots and this one is no different but on the whole, T3 was a great movie. The plot was good and consistent throughout, the storyline flowed nicely, the action was amazing and the intensity increased as we got deeper and deeper into the environment. Even my wife, who is not particularly a fan of the Terminator films, enjoyed this one. The characters were well developed and, contrary to some reviews, the acting was quite good. There was a story to follow and it keeps you guessing. There are some obvious conclusions that can be made but for every one of those there's also a surprise. The casting was a concern for me until I saw the film and when I left the theatre I was convinced that they made some smart decisions in their actor choices.<br/><br/>I would definately recommend T3 to anyone. People who have seen the original and T2 and anyone who has no clue what Terminator is all about.

","When I first heard about ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"", I was really excited... Arnold was coming back! I got really nervous when James Cameron ended up turning down the project, so I was a mixed bag as trailers for ""T3"" began popping up in late Spring 2003.<br/><br/>
Last night I saw ""T3"" at a sneak preview in Georgetown.<br/><br/>I was impressed as all Hell. ""T3"" totally rocked.<br/><br/>Everyone knows Arnold is back protecting John Conner from a new terminator. That's right, no T-800 or T-1000, but the T-X. The T-X played by one of the hottest women I've seen in a long time (Loken), is an awesome design indeed: a new terminator endoskeleton with multiple onboard weapon systems coated in liquid metal. Holy crap man! That is one bad ass terminator - I never thought they'd top the T-1000, but they did. The T-X kicks ass.<br/><br/>The movie is action packed, a non-stop thrill ride as critics might say. Claire Danes is hot and believable and Nick Stahl surprised me with his taking over of the John Conner role. Hats off to both of them.<br/><br/>By the time the credits were rolling and the Terminator theme was echoing through the theater, everyone in there was just like ""whoa"". The ending blew everyone away - all I can say is wow.<br/><br/>""T3"" is sure to become a classic in its own right.<br/><br/>The question remains, will there really be a ""Terminator 4""....<br/><br/>""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" gets an 8/10.

","may contain SPOILER<br/><br/>prior too going to see this film in the U.K. i have read several message boards and T-3 really has had a fair number of critics. Though personally i found the film to be superb. Solid acting, and why has no1 else pointed out , Nick Stahl ( john connor) looks so much like Kyle Reece, his father T-1. so even though its a different actor 2 T-2 ( Edward furlong) i still felt it was John connor, unlike in other series of films where the characters are played by different actors. The affects were great, and the pace of the film was a lot better than Matrix reloaded, which  found tedious at points. sorry to mention The matrix, but it is basicly a rip off of terminator, with the added touch of a computerised world. eg THE ONE - John connor - Neo Enemy - the machines - the machines Real world - humans dead, humans dead<br/><br/>i wont go on as this is a review for t-3. The only downer id say was the T-X, you dont look at her and think shes a terminator, unlike arnie, back to what hes best at, playing "" THE TERMINATOR"". People have moaned about there being too much comedy in this film, but come on with 3 billion deaths on the way, you need something to lighten things up a bit, Cameron would not have had the balls to end T-3 like that, he didnt even have the balls to make T-3, so mostow deserves more credit than hes being shown.

"TheEnigmaticMrKurtz","9","4","6","1 July 2003"," As good as T2, but great in it's own right
","Jonathan Mostow has done what some call impossible: he has matched the direction of James Cameron in Cameron's own series. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is an amazing visual spectacle as well as a story driven film. Mostow stages some amazing combat sequences, and Arnold is on top of his game in the role that made him famous. The script is well written, with classic Schwarzenegger one lines, and the repetition of the line ""She'll be back"" actually works. The movie is peppered with humor and smart dialogue. The story actually makes sense in the timeline, although taking some liberties. Instead of a vote of 10 the reason this film gets a 9 by me is that the action sometimes seems to take center stage, although it drives the story along. One scene comes to mind when the T-850 drives a truck through a wall, suddenly fuel barrels explode. The Terminatrix is an imposing villain, definitely a great screen character. Kristanna Loken's icy blue eyes truly make the T-X a menacing villain that you grow to hate. Nick Stahl plays John Connor as he should be; a boy who knows what he's destined to do but questions why he was chosen, and resents it every minute of his life. Overall the action and script are great, the direction is excellent, and Arnold breaks the slump of bad movies. Definitely a worthy sequel to a great franchise, unlike the disappointing Matrix Reloaded. No T4!!!(You'll understand when you see the movie, especially the ending)"

The answer for me and those in attendance (including<br/><br/>numerous T3 bashers) was a resounding YES!!!<br/><br/>I got my hopes WAY up for this movie, and I think for the first time<br/><br/>since I saw True Lies in 1994 (with high expectations) a movie actually<br/><br/>delivered on its promise.  This is not just a mindless action film. <br/><br/>This is not ""heartless"" (as I've heard some critics say).

Now there I said it...<br/><br/>It's hard though, to judge a movie these days as you become older and older cause the first time impressions will never become the same as when you saw like The Terminator as a 10 year old boy back in 1984. Still from time to time a movie comes along that simply grabs you by the ba...(well they are fragile) within 10 minutes and don't let go till you've tormented your wallet with half a dusin repeat viewings, which will be the case for me with this movie, once it's officially released. The last time I experienced this was in Â´98 when The Matrix was out (something that sadly wasn't repeated with ""Reloaded"").<br/><br/>Terminator 3 is simply AMAZING IMO. It is fast paced, in your face high definition action wrapped around a tight storyline with some very fulfilling revelations, but as an action piece, this baby comes close to being orgasmic!<br/><br/>Now though I may sound like it, I'm no Arnold/Terminator fanboy, but I AM an actionjunkie, a true sucker for clever action epics.<br/><br/>This movie took me by total surprise and that may be the explanation as to why I seem so positive. I really didn't expect much from this movie judging by the trailers. Not even the last trailer was particular good IMO, but let me tell you this is one of the rare times when a trailer truly didn't reveal anything from the movie. T3 is SOO MUCH bigger than what the trailer makes it appear.<br/><br/>I loved T2, it's one of my fav sci-fi movies, but T3 is just better! At NO point does this movie drag and though it does rehash most of the scenes from T2 it makes sure to nudge these scenes up like 50-100%, but at the same time it introduces a lot of new and fresh jaw-droppers. This movie will leave scars on the furniture of the theaters from all the nails that will dig into the seats.<br/><br/>To you skeptics out there, and I now there are plenty, FORGET YOUR WORRIES and go see this thing, cause NO ONE can claim to NOT be entertained by T3.<br/><br/>Isn't there anything negative? Well there was a corny cameo from T2 that I didn't like and I was certain I would hear the famous Brad Fiedel theme playing to the credits which it didn't (we got some remixed version in the end though). Other than that it was a perfect movie!<br/><br/>5/5"

","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines starts in Beverley Hills as a morphing killing machine named the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is transported back from the future, meanwhile in a desert not fat away another killer android named the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) also arrives from the future. They are both in search of future resistance leader & the saviour of mankind John Connor (Nick Stahl), the T-X has orders to kill him while the T-800 has orders to protect him. John himself breaks into a vet's clinic to steal drugs & is found by Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), the two become the center of a battle between the Terminator's as one wants them dead & the other not. Then John learns that the threat of Skynet has not been stopped, merely postponed & with the new Judgement Day fast approaching he decides to try & prevent it, again.<br/><br/>This American, German & British co-production was directed by Jonathan Mostow (apparently with the likes of Ang Lee, Ridley Scott & James Cameron being asked but turning it down) & is obviously the second sequel to James Cameron's superb sci-fi action hit The Terminator (1984), Cameron himself also wrote & directed the sequel Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) which is quite simply one of the greatest films ever, period. So with two such illustrious predecessors that quite rightly consider solid gold classics how does Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines hold up? Well the script takes the basic concept from Terminator 2: Judgement Day & goes with that, two Terminators sent back from the future, one to protect Connor the other to kill him, Connor trying to destroy Skynet & prevent Judgement Day from ever happening & a parade of big budget set-piece action scenes. Compared to the first two terminator film Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines isn't as good but I still found it enjoyable in it's own right & competing against two of the best films of all time is pretty difficult to do anyway. The makers seem to have changed the character of John Connor & what he was about, from a rebellious & resourceful youngster to a bit of a bland loser, the two Terminator's aren't played as emotionless androids either with both spouting various one-liners & making faces which is alright but doesn't seem right & while the story is fine it's nothing more than a rehash of ideas from the first two & doesn't take the franchise forward at all & by comparison to Cameron's films this is a little soulless. Having said that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines entertained me no end, I loved the new female Terminator (even though she feels like a gimmick), it moves along like a rocket & there are some terrific action set-pieces including an amazing car chase involving a huge crane. There are loads of explosions, fights, shoot-outs, car chases, pure wanton destruction & cool effects to keep me happy anyway. Sure Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines isn't the greatest film ever plot wise but there's enough going on elsewhere to enjoy to make this well worth a watch in my opinion.<br/><br/>The CGI computer effects are good & there are some terrific action sequences which is where Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines excels. The crane chase is a real stand-out moment & one of my all time favourite car chases featuring lots of explosions, outrageous stunts & general vehicular mayhem on a grand scale. Despite an 'R' rating in the US this got away with a '12' here in the UK & it does feel a little bit family friendly with the absolute minimum of violence shown which may not be a problem to most but I am a bit of a violence junkie & I missed it since we got violence in spades in the first two. While not as menacing as either Scwarzenegger from the first or Robert Partick from the second film Kristanna Locken is hot & looks totally gorgeous in her red leather catsuit, OK so I'm a shallow male what can I say? I loved any scene she was in & she has a real sexy & dangerous femininity about her although her special powers aren't that much of a step forward from those seen in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. There are nods & gags to the original two films that seem a little forced but are quite fun from Arnie's sunglasses to an amusing cameo by Earl Bohen reprising his role as Dr. Silberman.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of $170,000,000 you can see where the money went with virtual non stop action & flashy CGI effects, you certainly get your money's worth here. The film is well made but doesn't have Cameron's cold & stylish look & I really missed Brad Fiedel's stirring music that has been replaced by a much more forgettable & generic sounding soundtrack. The acting is alright, Schwarzenegger is OK, Stahl is bland, Danes is alright after having replaced Sophia Bush at short notice after a few days filming while Kristanna Locken was cast for her looks & excels in that department at least.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was never going to exceed it's predecessors which in my (& many other's) humble opinion are two of the greatest films ever made but for what it is I really enjoyed it.

","being a huge terminator fan since a young age, i can honestly say when this was released, somewhere in the back of my mind, i wasn't looking forward to it, but then again i gave it a go at the cinema's.<br/><br/>as most should be aware the story ends at t2, and the fact both are made by Cameron, it is clear he had no intention of continuing a story that had no other plot needed. also note most of the actors did not show up in t3, i think they knew it would kill their reputation, but i guess Arnie knew he would get some degree of fame.<br/><br/>Now did i like t3? oh dear no! i agree with other reviewers, its just one big chase scene, confusing and senseless. apparently the leader of the resistance sent the cyborg twice to ensure the future which he occupied ceases to exist! huh????? i couldn't help noticing the music was dull and not captivated, the fear and keep in suspense qualities that was presented in the past. i honestly got bored waiting for that something to happen, but it didn't! now i found out they will have a fourth instalments. oh dear! simply put, good action scenes from an otherwise rubbish and insult to Cameron's babies. i just imagine to myself this movies has no relevance to terminator itself.<br/><br/>It kinda kills the beauty if you catch my drift."
"pootc","1","7","13","25 December 2005"," Lacks direction, humanity and complex characters.
","After over a decade of waiting, wondering what came next in the masterful Terminator franchise starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in his most famous and iconic role - Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines made it's premiere in 2003 but this time without James Cameron at the helm. In his place a competent action director in Jonathan Mostow (U571 and Breakdown) to continue the legendary mythology spelled out so meaningfully in the previous classics. No pity, no remorse - no fate but what we make, right? Wrong.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 works as a stand-alone action film or straight up popcorn flicks for teenage multiplex hoards but as part of the acclaimed Terminator franchise it's an insulting, unintelligent and insignificant re-tread lacking direction, humanity and complex characters. If anything this devalues the franchise beyond recognition essentially back-tracking, rewriting and corrupting the mythology painstakingly established by James Cameron before trying to compensate for its lack of creativity with explosions and poorly placed slapstick humour.<br/><br/>Its one thing to unnecessarily build upon another movie's story, but to rewrite the entire meaning behind another movie is just cheap and nasty. The story itself offered nothing besides the beginning of Judgment Day which was already the way we knew the series was headed and instead of moving the logical way, which is forward, the writers tried to implement bogus twists and instead took some rather pointless and dull steps backwards essentially reversing the entire mythology of the series.<br/><br/>The notion desperately put forth in Terminator 3 is ridiculous, not to mention a complete repudiation of the themes and ideals spelled out so eloquently in Terminator's one and two. This is bad writing, tailored to suit an uninspired little story. How the writers felt adequate about avoiding the questions everybody has been asking for over a decade but more importantly how is it they live with themselves after re-writing the entire meaning behind such a classic mythology? 'Judgement Day is inevitable' is not an explanation. This one line shows how little talent, vision or depth the writers really had when put up to the take of writing such a large-scale film on their own.<br/><br/>Now to character development and relationships. Terminator 3 missed so many opportunities to establish it's characters and established no atmosphere whatsoever. The score is as dry as a bone lacking little to no emotion like Brad Fidel's and if anything, anything at all the film should have emphasized even more on the character of John Connor. You know the saviour of mankind, the leader of the human resistance like Sarah in Terminator 2 but failed to because there simply wasn't any time to between the breaking of key scenes with slapstick humour by clown Arnold or more pointless action. The opening voice over with Connor was the only real development throughout the movie but can you really call that development? I'd call it an easy explanation. The opening voice over is all the insight you really get into the mind of John Connor (who gets his age wrong) and unfortunately its not enough to warrant a great character like Sarah Connor, though Stahl's performance was firm.<br/><br/>How we went from the Terminator in 1984 to this is beyond me and while they may have the rights to the franchise but you'd think in having the rights to create such a high calibre film they'd first take the time to understand it and its importance. The writers (Brancato, Ferris) were completely void of any real new ideas and basically had re-tread old information with one original idea in mind for the movie, the oh so 'shocking' conclusion which was just another tool for yet another 'inevitable' sequel by these hacks who forgot to hold dear what Cameron's films made so memorable. 1/10"

I had an heartache and I was hurt deeply, cause that nipple-face who is Jonathan Mostow completely ruined the Terminator series with this awful heap of metal scrap. I had convulsions, the strange impression that I lost my balls, my eyes and my head, and even worse: I touched my head to assure that all my hair didn't fall...<br/><br/>In this movie, the dialogs are more funny and artificial than the usual, and this time, the actors did a really sickening job. But the most ridiculous ever, it's the Terminatrix when she inflates her breast in the car. Also, we didn't need a sequel, cause in the 2nd movie, Skynet was destroyed in the present and future by the Resistance, and the idea of a stupid super-virus in this film is too cheesy. I even heard that a 4th Terminator film is in preparation, but I think that it will be awful and useless to see, Arnold or not...<br/><br/>In two words this movie can give you suicidal tendencies and drive you sicker than plague if you see it, and it deserves 2 thumbs down, 2 middle fingers up and not the least (riddle me this, riddle me that: it has the form of a famous number, it's round and it's between everyone's butt...)<br/><br/>To all Terminators fans: don't watch it, cause you will have the same feeling that I had.

"bronty","1","7","13","12 June 2004"," Passionless, cookie-cutter, derivative & dull
","First and foremost, if they couldn't get James Cameron on board to helm a second sequel to ""The Terminator"", they just shouldn't have bothered, but this is Hollywood and so they pressed on, engaging the services of one Jonathan Morrow, a director you've never heard of before and aren't likely to hear of again anytime soon: simply put, this is ONE LOUSY DIRECTOR! True, no one is ever going to accuse the first two films of being part of the greatest movies ever made, and while I enjoyed the first (it was what it was: fun and creepy, even) and hated the second (too full of itself, too full of its own supposed ""importance"", it's James ""King of the World"" Cameron's overbloated message movie saying 'war is wrong!'. This just in), one can say at the very least they both had a passion, that whatever their faults the director, his stars, the screenwriter, etc., BELIEVED IN IT. Not this time, baby: from the word 'go', there isn't an original thought or idea on display, either behind or in front of the cameras, and it even goes so far as to rip its own franchise off, and not too well, either. James Cameron supposedly didn't want to do this film because he felt, correctly, that ""T2"" completed the story, and so THIS film becomes one predictable rehash of everything you've seen before, and NOT just in ""The Terminator"" movies: if you've seen even just a handful of action flicks, especially in the last few years, you'll be hard-pressed not to accurately guess what happens in each scene, or each shot, right down to the FX, which, after ""T2"", are also derivative and seem...been-there-done-that. One could hope that its stars might make up for the director's deficiencies but that's a lost cause, too: Nick Stahl, a not-untalented young actor, assumes the role of John Connor from Edward Furlong but doesn't have Furlong's sense of star-crossed vulnerability - he merely comes off cocky, and aware at every moment he's taken over a role ill-suited to him; as for the always-angst-ridden Claire Danes (seriously in danger of becoming this era's Jennifer Jason Leigh if she doesn't make a film in which she's happy, laughs, smiles, breaks wind, whatever!), she has the thankless task of replacing Linda Hamilton (this is driven home in one unintentionally funny moment when, in all seriousness, not long after Danes learns she and Stahl will be man and wife in the future and she's grabbed a gun and mowed down a machine-on-the-loose, Stahl says, ""You remind of my mother"", which gives proof that this film is not only written by a man but by a man who doesn't understand the first thing about women. I dare ANY man to say those words - ""You remind me of my mother"" - to a woman he likes or loves, then sit back and ruminate the possibility of a long, LONG, lonely existence.) Unfortunately, Danes has about 2 expressions: despair and disbelief. Both of these are understandable reactions to learning there are actual robotic lifeforms running amok in L.A. (as opposed to those making films like this), but her performance is wearing. HOWEVER, at least she GIVES a performance, unlike the Barbie doll chosen to be the Big Bad Terminator: for his role in ""T2"", Robert Patrick says he perfected his creepy, shark-like stare by studying birds of prey, and he was entirely successful in instilling fear; the young actress here (OK, so I forget her name - it isn't all that important since I seriously doubt you'll be hearing much about her) resembles nothing more than the over-blonde love child of Christina Ricci and Jamie Pressly, all work-the-runway supermodel swagger and pout, and ZERO menace; her attempts at trying to be ""fearsome"" - which consists of nothing more than lowering her chin and trying to stare through her tweezed eyebrows with her perfectly made-up eyes (apparently, in this terrible future, cyborgs - in addition to being the perfect killing machine - are also learned disciples of Estee Lauder) - are, at best, ridiculous, and often faintly hilarious. As for Arnold, well, all the concealer and pancake make-up in the world cannot hide what the camera makes GLARINGLY OBVIOUS: he's a little long-in-the-tooth for this kind of thing. At times, he practically seems to have been dipped in formaldehyde: you'll notice AT NO TIME is ANY strong light upon his face in ANYTHING but distant shots (where it may not be him, anyway), and all close-ups seem oddly darkened (Elizabeth Taylor used that trick, too: a black stocking over the lens to smooth out any tell-tale lines.) His appearance also smacks of desperation, reaching back to a role that he thought might put him back on top, after a grueling period where seemingly every film he'd made disappeared nearly without a trace. Actually, that, more than anything else, is what is wrong with this movie: the stink of desperation. Come to think of it, that ISN'T the worst thing; no...worse yet is that all concerned have succeeded in making an action film that's not just lifeless, it's dead-on-arrival."
"fritchie83","10","6","11","3 August 2003"," Jonathan Mostow is a genius!
","This is, without a doubt, definitely the best and biggest film of 2003. All of those people who doubted Jonathan Mostow should be ashamed of themselves, I know I am.  This film completely blew me away.<br/><br/>Arnold plays the part as T - 100 even better than he did the last two times It seem like there is no stopping this man - he just keeps on getting better and better!<br/><br/>Nick Stahl portrays John Connor, in the way that you would imagine a young man with so much stress on his shoulders to be like.  Jonathan Mostow has to be applauded for bringing this talented young actor into such a big movie for all us young ladies to dribble over.<br/><br/>Kristanna Loken, who is a little scary I must admit, is amazing at playing a new, more advanced, terminator model, named TX, who is trying to kill John Connor.  She only has a few lines in the film (like six), but I feel that this scares the audience even more as she has to act simply through her facial expressions.  Again, Jonathan Mostow has done a great job in casting when he introduced us to this former model.<br/><br/>All I have left to say is that the special effects in T3 are the way that special effects should be, they are not fake like in The Lord Of The Rings or Harry Potter.  Instead they are simply mind blowing, as well as the stunts.<br/><br/>So if you are going to see a film this year, I would strongly recommend Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines."

","As a HUGE fan of the previous Terminator films, I eagerly awaited this installment.  Although, as the release date loomed closer, I began having low expectations for the film.  Simply because T2 was so incredible.  It was an action film, but not JUST an action film.  The action was placed in a story about morality, human relationships, fate, and the possible dangers of the advancement of technology.<br/><br/>While T2 succeeded on many levels, T3 succeeds in none.  From beginning to end, I was just sitting there hoping it would get better.  John Connor's opening narration/update made me sick to my stomach - Just start the story already!  <br/><br/>The acting was terrible from the entire ensemble.  Kristanna Loken played her part like she was slapped in the middle of a B horror flick, Nick Stahl was weak, and Claire Danes (who I usually really like) seemed to have nothing to do but scream the entire time.<br/><br/>The writing was awful, making this an ""ending"" to T2 that just was not necessary.  Character development was pushed to the back-burner, as John Connor's character even regressed at one point.  The action had the distinct feeling of having been done before.<br/><br/>T3 belongs right next to Mostow's other waste, U-571.  In the trash. 1/10...........only because I could not give it a 0"

","Ok. I am a HUGE sci fi fan and I love Terminator and T2. I had huge hopes for T3 but it just left me feeling REALLY REALLY EMTY.<br/><br/>1st. The movie felt like it was cut. It felt like it was heavily cut. The movie runs for about 104 mins.. T2 ran for well over 2 hours atleast.<br/><br/>The dialogue was at zero. And I suspect alot of plot never really got explored, like when T-X is sent to kill Connors officers.. She kills 2. And thats that.<br/><br/>Furthermore there is no suspense no nothing like that. Remember T2? We didnt even know who was the good / Bad Terminator until Well 25-30 mins into the movie. Here The Biggest scene in the whole movie with the crane chase is well underway after 25-30 mins. It just feels like they rushed everything. Do the movie companies really give us so little credit nowadays so they think we wont sit thru a film unless it has action ALWAYS??<br/><br/>Now to my biggest concern which ties to the cutting.<br/><br/>The movie is basicly just ACTION non stop ACTION. I know you will say ok well its a good action movie. Yes i agree But this is terminator.. they had 12!! years to come up with a INCREDIBLE script. What we get is a script that is nonstop action no dialogue no plot no nothing except mindnumbing action.<br/><br/>I mean first its the fight at the veterinarian, then they drive for what? 5 mins then they fight at the cemetary, then they fight at the military complex then they go to the fallout shelter and the movie is basicly Done. There is so minimal dialogue (ok i know im repeating myself) that I could puke. This is a Terminator movie not a action movie they should have done more.<br/><br/>
And now to the minor stuff.<br/><br/>Whats the deal with all these stuff that makes no sense. Like when he puts on these silly glasses the male stripper had then he takes them off and crushes them. Ok hes a ROBOT, does he have some coolness program he must obey? If he has a directive to wear glasses he should have worn these it would have made complete sense.<br/><br/>Then whats the deal with counting how many cops hes killed?? I hate how movies these days have aboslutely no balls. Like when Spielberg replaced the rifles in E.T with walkie talkies.. This terminator was Sent fro the future he had NO directive not to kill cops he repeats his directives More then once i think and its solely to ensure that connor and his wife lives.<br/><br/>
This movie was made for the fast buck and it sucks because they destroyed possibly the greatest line of movies ever<br/><br/>Thanks for the rant<br/><br/>Sue"

","***** SPOILERS *****<br/><br/>I would rate this movie a -10 out of 10, if it were possible. I don't mean to be rude but I just wonder if you have seen a completely different movie then I.<br/><br/>The problem I have with the movie is that it offset the entire story compared to the first two movies. Now Skynet is a virus infected AI. Where did that come from ? Why didn't Reese know about it, why didn't the second terminator know about it, why didn't the third terminator know about it ?<br/><br/>The first two were dark movies with an ever present danger, in this one all the comic reliefs make it more like a parody of the first two. To many focus on the mindless action relief. In T and T2 there was a thought with the action (T2 a bit less then the first), in T3 nothing. And what did they do with the excellent score ?<br/><br/>In T3 they killed the essence of the first two, dark good story, action with brains and a score to match.<br/><br/>As a huge fan of the first two I feel betrayed by this movie and would love to have it erased from my memory."

The plot made sense. A couple questions here and there. <br/><br/>Arnold again? No, uh uh. How many terminators are there that look like Arnold? And he's lost his edge. It's getting kind of scary that he keeps on trying to act cool. <br/><br/>For the T-X(can't remember her name), she did a good job considering what parts she was against. No one can compare to Robert Patrick's performance. But she did have a sinister edge. <br/><br/>John Conor(can't remember his name), was alright. I couldn't really get into his charactor as much as I did with Eddie's performance in the 2nd terminator. <br/><br/>And Claire Danes!? Eww. She's a horrible actress. I didn't mind her too much.

"NetherV","1","5","9","5 October 2003"," Trash. An insult to James Cameron and an even bigger insult to the Terminator story.
","First off, i generally give good reviews on lots of movies because i like to turn off from the real world and i realize that movies are for entertainment, but having said that i think Terminator 3 was the biggest load of trash i have ever seen. I LOVED the first two, the cast, the script, the storyline the effects blahblahblah everything was PERFECT, but this movie? Jesus no.<br/><br/>Now the much debated storyline was of course a letdown, i still don't understand how something they prevented from being made (skynet) suddenly existed and how  did they manage to send 2 terminators back when there isn't even a  war, maybe i missed a large chunk of the movie or something, i think the idea is something to do with the war being inevitable even though theres no way all this shit could have happend in the first place, it just did, cool.<br/><br/>as for the acting, the one liners were awful, the new enemy was a nice idea but the chick who played her role sucked :( And the whole tight leather outfit just made it even made it look even more pathetic. Thew new john conner wasn't john conner at all. I think the only good addition to the movie was claire danes, she played her part well, props to her.<br/><br/>2 scenes which i hated were:<br/><br/>1) bathroom fight with the 2 terminators - the tx just throws arnold across the room with no effort, why would she have a problem fighting him after? yes i know she did kick his ass but he shouldn't have been able to put up the slightest bit of a fight, they should have either kept it even or made it a complete blowout (one termiantor destroying the other) they shouldn't have done both it was just retarded.<br/><br/>2) when arnold was approaching john outside the plane trying to resist hurting him - robots don't have emotions, IF A ROBOT IS PROGRAMMED TO DO SOMETHING IT DOES IT, NOT BECAUSE SOME GUY HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW DOESN'T WANT HIM TO. And the fact that he slightly changes his voice when he says ""I AM A MACHINE"" made me sad. It seems as though nobody else noticed that but whatever.<br/><br/>there was probably a million other things i could point out, but i can't be bothered, so anyway i think that this movie was a real let down, a below par trashy movie with women in leather cheesy one liners car chases and a typical ending for marketing, they'll obviously make another, lets hope james cameron answers our prayers and brings back the magic that was in the first two.<br/><br/>0.5/10."

","I beg of you not to pay to watch this film. Doing do will only encourage further series-destroying sequels.<br/><br/>The inventiveness, the atmosphere, the sincerity, the tension and so many other attributes of the first two films are gleefully swept away by this trash. Perhaps James Cameron is not the finest director in America, but after 109 painful minutes of this film you realise just what Cameron could do, and Mostow can't.<br/><br/>The attempt to inject humour into this film at every opportunity was severely misjudged. Cameron's screenplay for the first and second film kept the tension high, explained the story without becoming over complicated and involved us with the characters. No fear of any of this with Terminator 3. After about twenty minutes I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of the characters, and Nich Stahl's acting is so lamentable that you are left to wonder who could have possibly been worse in the role.<br/><br/>Mostow's direction is a mess, with scenes shot too close, removing style and clarity from chase scenes and reducing them to a bewildering array of explosions and broken glass. Eyes quickly glaze over, and you just know everything will work out in some way for our dull heroes.<br/><br/>The special effects in this are not a patch on other recent productions, and the glossy computer animation of the terminators, especially during the opening future-war scene and Loken's weapon attachment are lacking all the ingenuity of the sublime T-1000 effects from 1991.<br/><br/>Add to this mix an appalling score by Marco Beltrami that is instantly forgettable (surely a recognisable theme would have been the first priority in such a hackneyed film) and a complete irreverence for the story of the previous two films and you're left with a movie that makes you wish you hadn't seen it, and wish that the studio had left Cameron's work alone."

"deftones_adrenaline","3","6","12","15 October 2006"," T3: A systematic breakdown on why this film sucks from a Terminator FAN
","Reasons why this film is crap...<br/><br/>1. The Terminator (Arnold) is a T-101 in Terminator 3...(bashes Mr. Mostow in the skull) NO! NO! NO! In T1 & T2, the Terminator is a T-800: Cyberdyne Systems MODEL 101. If you can't get the BASIC facts straight, you shouldn't assume the helm of any major and beloved franchise! <br/><br/>2. Linda Hamilton (Sarah Connor) turned down an initial version of the script because T3 portrayed Sarah Connor as a weaker character while maintaining the ""weak"" John Connor.<br/><br/>3. Make way for Katherine Brewster, John Connor's ""Sarah-Connor-wanna-be"" wife, who saves his ass constantly. Yes, saves John Connor, the future military leader! The character, John Connor, is completely subdued in T3.<br/><br/>4. The gay stripper at the male strip club with the star sunglasses? No! The whole reason the Terminator ever started wearing sunglasses is in T1 when he had to disguise his face after his eye cover was damaged and he couldn't ""blend in"" with society. In T2, the sunglasses weren't necessary either, but the Terminator didn't have the glasses on for much of the movie. Talk to the hand? Completely unnecessary and an ancient phrase at that! 5. ""She'll be back?"" Stop with the catch phrases of ""...be back."" 6. The premise of the Terminators in the past is to blend in with society while hunting and killing their prey. The T-X is a ""down grade"" from the T-1000 in T2. She has weaponry built in (doesn't fit in at a dinner party) and an endoskeleton under liquid metal. One aspect made known in T2 was the fact that the T-800 endoskeleton could be harmed and wear-out opposed to the T-1000 which was pure liquid metal, no skeleton to be beaten. The T-1000 could take tons of Damage and no sign of being harmed.<br/><br/>There are a few more reasons. I know people will attack this post, but I am fundamentally correct in my statements. Audiences crave seeing films like T3: Rise of the Machines and Superman Returns even though they are pretty much, but not completely, crap because people just want to see Superman fly again or see the Terminator back in action! Damn the good characters and the good story lines that made people love the original films to start with. The more things change...the worse they get!"
"Tom16uk","5","6","12","24 August 2005"," Don't fix something that isn't broken.
","Instructions on how to fix something that isn't broken: <br/><br/>1. Take 2 amazing films. <br/><br/>2. Take the plot and storyline. <br/><br/>3. Take the FINISHED story and try to CONTINUE it with a rubbish excuse <br/><br/>4. Take away lots of violence so that it can be rated '12A' <br/><br/>5. Include some un-scary CGI scenes and acting <br/><br/>6. Make too many jokes an take away the seriousness<br/><br/>Your outcome.. Terminator 3. <br/><br/>Its hard to know where to start. Lets get the good pints out first. Kristianna Loken, who plays the T-X - a part machine, part liquid metal robot that makes Arnie, the T-101 look ""obsolete"". Loken does an excellent job an takes the character really well. I think thats the only good point.. Flaws fill this film from start to finish. You can partly blame the new directing that has modernised this film too much, and turned it into some scenes as a joke. <br/><br/>Their are no gloomy, well filmed fight sequences as in the previous 2 films, and the jokes in this film are quite utterly poor. The worst idea of the lot was at the start, where Arnie (T-101) walks into a bar and gets his clothes of a gay stripper. Oh dear.. And it gets worse wen he walks out of the bar and puts on a pair of pink sparkly star glasses. Are we honestly expected to believe that a super-intelligent robot, with a database of millions of facts an information would put on these glasses? Thankfully, he sees sense and stamps on them. A slow start to a slow film. Their are plenty more of these stupid jokes, but lets avoid them. <br/><br/>The fight sequences are actually not bad - you sense the feeling neither robot will win as they go on for long times. However, the CGI lets the sequences down a little, as with many parts of this film. In Terminator 1, you could become scared through stop-motion animation and real props and makeup. I'm afraid computers seem to have replaced that. No longer do you get shivers down your spine, but more of a sense to laugh. The only good CGI sequence is were the T-X transforms from being Katherines boy friend to her normal self. Its a really realistic scene, and shows what we can achieve in the special effects department. But there's a point you just have to stop. <br/><br/>Whats more, this film shouldn't have even been made! In terminator 2, all the computer chips were destroyed along with Cyberdyne. Therefore its impossible to continue the saga. Nooo, because Arnie has a perfect excuse; ""Judgement was inevitable"". More like ""I wanted more money, just like the film company and the box office"". I'm sure everyone got enough money when the film was produced to be rated a 12, so it just so happens that adults and kids can watch it, equalling more sales. <br/><br/>You could analyse more problems with this film all day, all I have done is picked out the big ones. For any Terminator lovers that enjoyed the previous film, you may feel almost embarrassed. For first time watchers, you will probably enjoy, as you have not seen the quality in the previous films. The only way to enjoy the whole Terminator saga is to not watch this movie."

Even though T2 was made many years earlier the special effects still looked better then this film (except the one scene with Arnie at the end), and also it lacked the darkness, and suspense of the previous films I felt one of the biggest criticism of the film was that the t101 was completely out classed by the new terminator and so you really felt that in every action scene they were going to loose. At least in T2 you felt Arnie had a chance but there was never that feeling in this film. I do realise to some people this might be stupid but the confrontation between the new terminator and Arnie just felt wrong because we all knew Arnie was going to have his a** kicked Also even though Arnie had worked out to get into shape for this film he still looked to clunky and slow (if you can understand that) and I think that made the film less enjoyable overall. You never really felt that Arnie was a terminator just a out dated machine, in T2 Arnie looked (excuse the expression) cool, the scene where he was on the motorbike shooting at the T1000 was awesome but there were no such scenes in this film.<br/><br/>Having a female as the terminator was also wrong, it did not feel right in this film There was also to much humour in this film (probably to give the 12a rating) and that was completely unnecessary, who on earth thought that putting Arnie in purple star shaped sunglasses was a good idea!!!!!!!!!! This really did ruin the film because you could never take Arnie seriously after that John Conner was poor as well, in T2 he showed courage and leadership but here he just looked like a wimp you never really believed that this person could be the saviour of humanity, I don't believe this was the actors fault more the direction of the film that made him into this charhachter I do realise I have criticised this film considerably but it's just after seeing T2 and how awesome that was this film did not even come close, however as a stand alone film it is good but if compared to the previous films it then just looks old and outdated"
"saarvardi","10","4","7","11 April 2007"," One of the best finales I personally have ever seen on the big screen
","One of the most profound childhood memories I will always remember was seeing Terminator 2 on the big screen. The scope of the plot, the groundbreaking effects, and of course  the one and only Arnold Schwarzenegger, than at the prime of his cinematic career  created a larger than life experience that made me tremble like the little kid I was at the time.<br/><br/>Naturally, I was one of those very eager fan boys that looked forward to the third installment of the series upon its release 12 year later, and unlike many of those  I wasn't disappointed with the final result that unfolded before me on screen. Sure, the story seemed somewhat rushed at times, and the basic plot contradicted the final conclusion of the previous film; but once you get over the initial frustration from this sudden change of arc, you're in for one very intense action ride.<br/><br/>While the plot here is similar to that of the previous films  with one Terminator sent to the past to kill off the future resistance against the machines and the other sent back to protect humanity's last chance  what's good about this film is that we actually get to see how Judgment Day actually occurs, with the final 10-15 minutes of the film being one of the best finales I personally have ever seen on the big screen. Once you realize that this time its for real, and the events have been set to begin the greatest attack ever set against mankind, you get that tingling feeling back inside  the one you got upon viewing T1 & T2. This unique and special feeling, and this alone, is worth the perfect 10 I give Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines."

","How could they do this? How could James Cameron let them? T2 was and is the only reason I ever give action movies a chance. Its heart and simple but powerful theme has haunted me ever since I was a child, when I would stay up all night and watch it while everyone was asleep, so not a single sound would distract me. It to me is so much more than great special effects that were astounding for their time, more than a huge action blockbuster. It was and is a portrait of humanity's struggle against the horrors we create for ourselves, of the cruelty of fate, of the power of family. It is an example of all the right elements coming together at the right time to create something so powerful and moving that it has inspired a force of loal fans who seem to feel the same outrage I do about T3.<br/><br/>T2 ended with a sense of hope for the future, leaving us all the gift of being able to imagine ourselves the fate of the world. No one could've devised a better ending to the story. T3 (and now T4, I hear) are lame excuses to use a popular name and popular characters to continue a story in a way that sends it spiraling down from the intelligence and power it had in T2. It infuriates me that anyone would cheapen an excellent movie with unnecessary and inferior sequels. Does anyone in Hollywood bother to think up *original* ideas anymore? Maybe I should stop coming up with my own ideas for screenplays and novels and, I don't know, pen a crappy sequel to E.T. ::sigh:: The casting probably bothers me more than anything else, oddly enough, though I would have protested any superfluous sequel no matter who it starred. Frankly, Claire Danes should not be on camera. EVER. Anyone who made the mistake of seeing the trashy remake of Romeo and Juliet, made for those who can't bear the pain of cracking a book, will get what I'm saying. She acts like she's reading off a cue card, and that really only works for Arnold, who will never get my vote for betraying the Terminator story. Linda Hamilton, who gave a stunning performance in T2, was smart enough to stay away, and I hope Eddie Furlong, who did a remarkable job in T2, especially considering he'd never acted before, never sees the imbecile they replaced him with.<br/><br/>I guess the people behind T3 thought they were terribly clever using a female villain, the reasoning being, I suppose, ""Hey, she has boobs! That will make up for our utter lack of plot!"" I shudder to think what T4 will be throwing at us. Maybe John Connor's future children will fight the machines a la Spy Kids, and Hilary Duff can provide the soundtrack. Sadly enough, if T3 was possible, anything is.<br/><br/>The nightmare continues. Since sequels are proving how undefeatable those machines are, maybe they can transport me back to 1992, so I can prevent this from happening."

","I went into this movie not expecting much, afterall it lacked Linda Hamilton, James Cameron, even the man that did the musical score. Arnold was there but, hey, you've seen the type of movies he has been in lately. Lets just say you can tell this wasn't written by Cameron. Its doesn't even seem to be written to any coherent line of reason. Why would the Terminatrix go after John's lieutenants if the other two could care less in the past? Why did her hand magically fix itself when her programming told her it was broken? Why would Sarah Connor fill her coffin with weapons? How does a machine remote control cars when no such computer exists in said cars? How the hell did the Terminatrix even find and then outrun John's truck with that huge semi truck (They can't move THAT fast!) Where did the computer virus come from? How is Skynet still Skynet since it was originally a mainframe but now a software program? The original films say Skynet killed virtually everyone when they tried to pull the plug when humanity feared Skynet's sentience yet here they supposedly can't since its ""software"" and not ""hardware"". So the memory of the Terminator from T2 was false since that data came from Skynet? Why didn't this Terminator kill humans since he didn't swear to John like T2 and especially since he could only take orders from Claire Danes? What was up with the one liners by Arnold? How was this Terminator's power source different from the two prior movies? In Terminator and T2 you see the main power source is in the abdominal area with a back up. Here he has some stupid slot where he can crack it open and turn it into a mini nuclear bomb. Why did the military have multiple prototypes? Last time I checked a prototype of anything was simply that one piece to be tested and then built in mass if it worked. Why the hell did the place even have a particle accelerator when their work in the lab had nothing to do with atomics?!?!? How did the Terminatrix even pull herself off the magnet when it was never turned off? Why did John continue to hang around the L.A. area if he didn't want to be found? And this is only a few of my problems with the flick. The acting wasn't that good (John is definately not an inspiring leader), the plotting was slow, and they attempted too much humor (the growing breasts was useless and sophmoric). James should have gone with the original T2 ending of John Connor playing in the future with his daughter as Sarah watched talking of how they averted Judgement Day. This trash was far from worthy of the Terminator name and, funniest of all, I saw this movie the day after the premier and the theater was virtually empty. Is that a good sign?"

","*** contains spoilers (the big ones) *** <br/><br/>*** Commenting Terminator 3: ... Well... (pause) Really... (pause) It's a sad day for all of us... (minute of silence) ...For shame...<br/><br/>*** Explanation: The third part of Terminator is jumping out of the general outlook of the very concept of the Terminator (the thing that made it the best movie there is - by the way...). It looks like as if they didn't have enough money to pay Harlan Ellison (the one who thought it all) to tell them what happened next, so they went improvising and hired those who invented ""Matrix"" to help them... (""Matrix"" is good, but - my point is that they aren't the same category of SF movies) (many people are comparing ""Matrix"" to conceptual-cyber-kung-fu-techno-ballet). It's completely confused: there is also some flavor of some strange morbid kind of feminism in the air of the movie, it looks like a women's make-up commercial or a rapper video, or an enrique iglesias video (all-together), the stench of those typically ""teenage"" concepts in the acting of those characters (used the wrong way too), modernistic technology and design (mis)used for scenes in this movie (it's just not meant that way (remember Terminator 2(?) - ""Guns 'n' Roses"", bikers, heavy greasy dirty machinery))... it's like a mocking laugh of some feminist to what they interpretate as ""macho stuff"" into the face of a real fan of the Terminator movie, then that ""all-american patriot"" flavor somehow mixed-in into the fabric of the movie (which (anyway) wasn't meant to be the crucial point in the original concept of ""The Terminator""), shallow plot and unconvincing relationships between the characters, illogical developments, kiddy-wanna-see features and scenes dropped randomly into the timline of the movie... man... they buried it... (maybe just that is their only goal with this ""sequal"" (it seems like the only logical thing to think regarding it)) *** Statement: For shame, really... IF THEY HAVE HAD HIRED ME TO CREATE SCENARIO FOR ""WHAT HAPPENED NEXT"" I (""I"" - and I tell that with full responsibility) WOULD MAKE BETTER, MORE EXCITING, MORE LOGICAL & LESS EMBARESING NEXT PART OF THE TERMINATOR MOVIE (well - that's the easiest part of the job...) - AND ALSO I MUST ADD THAT I COULD MAKE A FEW SEPARATE(!) PARTS OF IT TOO (""The Terminator"" has vast potentials, I don't know what happened with those people)... (maybe you are asking yourselves ""What is this man talking about?"" right now, but if you would know what I'm talking about (the scenario I see as a logical next step) then you would be saying something completely different)... I am challenging those who made it.<br/><br/>*** Conclusion: I say - Let us all pretend that it is all just a bad dream; forget all about ""Terminator 3"" that currently exists in reality as a movie; discard it, and say that people who made scenario for ""Terminator 3"" were on some serious sedatives when they wrote it... THEN(!): make the REAL movie of what Actually(!) happened next.<br/><br/>The first two parts of Terminator movie gave us hints of what great would happen next... the shame is that those who wrote T3 scenario were blind to see it...

","Having been an almost fanatical fan of T1 and T2 i awaited the release of T3 with much anticipation. I had purchased the special editions of the previous 2 films on DVD, and now i was awaiting for the third to come out on theaters. Then i went and saw it...<br/><br/>Oh boy! Was it a stink fest and a half. I'm sorry, but the previous two films had developed characters, serious villains and realistic scenes (as realistic as a Science Fiction films get). T3 however took the great Saga of the Terminator films, dumbed it down to a generic action movie and did what Cameron did not want to do in t2, make the Terminator a clown. I almost walked out of the film when i saw that the Terminator kept being the butt of every joke. Sure there were chuckles in T2 when the Terminator didn't act quite human but in T3 he was just missing the big red shoes, very sad cause i like Arnold as an actor. I was expecting for the Director to take the movie seriously, but instead it seemed almost a comedy, shattering the image of the Terminators as implacable killing machines and making them comical. I guess i know now how Star Wars fans felt when they saw Episode 1. In conclusion, the thin story line, 2d characters and general atrocious scenes of random violence made this film the nose dive of the saga. If a 4th film is made i doubt it will ever come out of the gutter. Sad really, cause it was my favorite movie."

"RyanEberhart","9","3","5","28 September 2013"," Best of the Four (so far)
","Of the four Terminator movies this is my favorite. I like Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines because it actually tells the story of how the machines takes over. I get that the first two movies are an important part of the story but to me they were a shadowy prelude to this movie.<br/><br/>The graphics are just as good, if not better, as the graphics in the second movie. And a hundred times better than the first movie. The premise of this movie is very well thought out, especially when the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) explains that the apocalypse was only delayed not averted. The Terminator says that the apocalypse is inevitable.<br/><br/>According to Internet Movie Database movie fans that have rated this movie has rated in on average 6.4 stars. I however, have to give this 9 stars out of 10. I gave it 9 stars because the evil Terminator was a woman this time, and she was hot. Also, there were many great scenes, even the one where the good Terminator has to get clothes. Yes, I know Arnold is naked in this scene and I shouldn't be talking about this, but it is funny that he goes into a local strip club... on ladies night. The Terminator scanning for appropriate clothing is hilarious. However, I did like the evil Terminator looking for clothes more to my liking.<br/><br/>The three best scenes are as follows, at least in my opinion.<br/><br/>The first scene I liked was the scene in which the evil Terminator (Kristanna Loken) tracks down John Connor's lieutenants, before they become his lieutenants. I don't like that she is killing these people. What I like is that she is so methodical and cold. The best part is when she comes to the animal clinic looking for Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), but finds John Connor (Nick Stahl).<br/><br/>The next best scene takes place just after the first favorite. It's the chase scene where John is driving the animal clinic's truck with Kate in the back. The evil Terminator is driving a Terex-Demag AC 160, better known as a crane truck. The good Terminator is driving a motorcycle. The good Terminator is knocked off the motorcycle but ends up hanging from the end of the crane. However, he ends up getting knocked off the crane by a fire engine. The sequence of this scene is nothing short of remarkable.<br/><br/>The third and final best scene is when the two Terminators are fighting at the airforce base Kate's father, General Robert Brewster (David Andrews), is commanding and in charge of Skynet. The fight scene is fairly awesome and a little drawn out. There is a breakaway scene that shows Kate and John escaping, Kate grabs a machine gun and shoots a mini-plane robot thing. Kate looks at John and says ""what?"" John replies, ""You remind me of my mother."""

","I was really looking forward to the prospect of a third instalment to the Terminator series, but when i read that it was to be a 12A rating, i was outraged. There's no need for it, is there. If you look at the 3rd movie it tells you all. It has an edgy and out of touch storyline. It's not directed by James Cameron, it was left for 12 years to be revisited, it has no Linda Hamilton, no Edward Furlong(they left it to late for him, not seeing the inevitable, that he would end up in rehab)and the main attraction and the only attraction is a 56 year old Terminator who is on the verge of bowing out of the industry(Arnie). These are not the things that frustrate me in a big way, i'll tell you what it is, it's the films disgraceful attention to detail: 1) Nick Stahl(John Connor) says that the Terminator visited him first when he was 13, when anyone who actually watched T2 will know that John was 10 in the 1995 based Terminator 2, and he would have had to have been 10 because his mother, Sarah fell pregnant with him in late 1984(shown in Terminator). 2) It says on Sarah Connors coffin that she was born in 1959 and died in 1997 from leukaemia. She wasn't born in 1959, she was 19 in 1984, that was explained in T2, she had to be born in 1964 or 1965. 3) John says in T3 that his mother contracted Lukemia in 1994, and died from it shortly after the predicted Judgement Day. Now if that's the case why wasn't this mentioned in 1995 based T2, well i'll tell you why, they didn't expect Linda Hamilton to turn down the 3rd movie role, so they created some bull crap story to cover up her disappearance. I didn't reckon much of Nick Stahl's dry performance and i think that Director Jonathan Mostow & writers John Branicato, Michael Ferris & Tedi Sarafian should give each other some hard slaps and be cast out of the movie making industry for ruining a franchise by making the third instalment having never watched the first two movies. They just wanted to make money, they don't care about those hardcore fans, they don't love films, they mock the industry. 12A gets the kids in, gets the money in, takes the brilliance out.

","***This comment is one gigantic spoiler, so brace yourself*** <br/><br/>Firstoff I've been a huge Terminator fan since I was the age of 6. I love both films and they're in my Top 3 of movies of all time (Along with The Godfather, and Goodfellas) Now this T3 comes along, and it's supposed to be a bigger more Badass Terminator than we already know. Rather than give my review, I'm going to give you a play-by-play of how this movie starts from my point of view.<br/><br/>This movie starts off, no Terminator Theme, no frightening yet mysterious visions of fire, just a black screen with the casts names up there. After a minute of agonizing nothingness, we hear John Connor speak. Now this isn't the rebellious, ""Doesn't give a damn,"" ""Leader of the Resistance"" John Connor we know and love. No-no-no that would be too cool. Instead he hear the first words of what would later be found to be a whiny little brat that could couldn't lead a dog to a can of Alpo. His first words are ""No Fate but what we make for ourselves"" (an idea that was presented to us in the first 2 films, but after getting into this 'film', we'll soon realize that James Cameron's idea will be sh-t all over, and it's ass will be wiped with dollar bills.) After we hear him yap for a while, we cut to a CGI nightmare of the future. This scene is the first major rip-off of the first 2 films, the difference is the original version (again, I remind you that it was made in 1984) looked 10x better.<br/><br/>Fast forward a few minutes (I mean this movie has to get better,) And we see the classic scene where The Terminator arrives. Only this time it looks like a bad comic book. It literally looks like a parody of the originals. And do we get a tough, bad-ass, gives your children nightmares Terminator ? No-no, again, that would be too cool. We get some Victoria Secret model with neat hair, perfect make-up, and motherly eyes. The overdone CGI, which include the manikins melting and a 'cool' grid that surrounds the time portal is just enough to make me sick to my stomach. After she steals a car (it's a Lexus, by the way if you didn't see the 8 foot, million dollar logo) she makes a call on her (Nokia) cellphone and identifies her 8 targets. Blah-blah, runs red light, cop car, Victoria's Secret ad, boobs, likes cops gun.<br/><br/>If that weren't enough of a slap in James Cameron's face, this will be. We see Arnold stroll into a Bar, just like in T2. But get this, it's not a Biker-bar this time, it's...he-he...I can't stop laughing while typing this...it's... a male strip club! And they all think Arnold is a male stripper he-he! While ""Macho Man"" is playing in the background, Arnold spots clothing that fit him...and get this...they're on a Stripper! Who would have guessed!? BRILLIANT writing. After quite possibly the gayest exchange I've ever seen in a movie (and I've seen Brokeback mountain,) I'm wrong yet again. Apparently the writers thought it would be funny if The Terminator, the same guy who mercilessly shot the wrong Sarah Connor in the face, and tried to run the real one down with a Mac truck...wore pink Elton John sunglasses. Why again did Arnold agree to this ? (Oh yea, 30 million big ones) You can literally hear the writers laughing to themselves. Only it's not a normal laugh, it's one of those geeky, nasally, Steve Urkel laughs. Next scene: How did he remember to look in the sun visor for keys when John taught to the other Terminator? <br/><br/>I'm not going to even go into this movie any further, because I honestly feel like I'm losing braincells writing a review for it. In summary, this movie is a joke. An unfunny caricature and borderline parody of, arguably, 2 of the greatest films ever produced. Lets see if the Sarah Connor Chronicles, and T4 can clean up the mess that T3 has made for the franchise.<br/><br/>One star."

For me the problem was that this film basically ignores the first two films. It's like the The Exorcist: The Heretic, it completely ignores the main events of the first part. If you are going to make a sequel, make sure that you include the events in the first part. Aliens did but again it was an action movie, not a Sci-Fi horror film like the first part was. Plus I think it was a good idea to have a female antagonist but it doesn't mean anything if she does the same thing over & over again.

The CGI is credible, but not nearly enough to save this doomed film. After terminator 2, the story ended with a sense of ambiguity, almost to give the film a more realistic edge, what the screen doesn't show me, my mind makes it more powerful by imagining the outcome. The creation of this movie has ruined this mental picture, and ruined the last shred of Arnold Schwarzeneggers dignity. At least in the other films he was cool and hard, they ruined it by adding the comedy aspect (you all know what i'm talking about).

I could go on and on about how horrible this movie was. First of all, whoever wrote the script needs to be executed. This is prime example of what not to do. Second, the whole storyline was bogus and highly unoriginal. I was so hoping to see a futuristic waist land like how they should in the first two films and to officially see the war against the machines. Instead, they gives a load of horses---. Third, the acting was so atrocious that I could feel my brain cells leaking out of my head. Fourth, not even Arny himself could make this a fun movie. I admit that I like his silly catch phrases but it just didn't work in this film. For instance, instead of saying ""I'll Be Back"" like in the other films he says after a fight with the T-X ""She'll be Back"". Need I say more.

I was saddened by it. What a waste of an opportunity to finish off the series on a high note.<br/><br/>As a technical achievement it is exceptional but the script is flat and lifeless.

","T3 is so bad that it completely tarnishes the entire series.  Why they find it necessary to go the comical route is beyond me.  If any of the lame jokes that found their way into the movie were actually funny then maybe it wouldn't have been so bad but ""talk to the hand?""  Give me a break.  That whole morality issue they tried to impart on the terminator this time was incredibly funny though.  Unfortunately it wasn't meant to be.  And why did they send back a wrinkly, less muscular terminator this time?  Because Arnold has entered the washed up era of his career and thought that throwing together a 3rd installment for his most popular work would re-ignite his career.  It's so sad when good stars go bad."
"Hoog","1","4","8","2 July 2003"," The original crew dropped out, this is what happened
","Being that there are so many points in Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines which could make you realize its a bad movie, its hard to determine the first one that really makes you give up all hope for the remaining hours. I'll help you because its really quite obvious; When Arnold pulls out shades from his leather jacket, puts them and realizes that (Ha Ha!) there star shaped!! Then he smirks and crunches them. If he had left them on you really wouldn't have noticed because the rest of the movie is spent with the bad-ass T-1000 cracking inside joke one-liners about how ""robotic"" he is.<br/><br/> In an attempt to top T2000 (from T2), they decided that the cool metal skeleton robot could be covered by the really cool liquid metal to form the coolest robot ever! Obviously they realized how stupid that was and just decided to make it a hot chick who can do, literally, anything. You know where this is going because they recycled it from the second movie. John Connors must be saved blah blah blah. The few writing elements which are new to T3 are old to anyone who's seen a movie before.<br/><br/>Even though Arnold has way too many lines for a killing machine, he still plays a great robot. Its easy to pick apart actors who play robots but this was always his best role and he does it better than anyone else. When she wasnt the butt of a joke or timing out the perfect punchline, Clair Danes delivers the only other believable performance in T3. I guess she slipped through the cracks because Nick Stahl and Krisstana Loken text book ""acted"" there way through the entire movie draining life out of the already decaying script.<br/><br/> If you could orchestrate the perfect bad movie scene by scene you would inevitabley produce T3. It was exciting to watch. Each scene that went by I grew more and more excited to see how they could possibly make this movie any worse. Amazingly, through bad direction weak acting and horrendous writing, they did it! Too bad the Wayans brothers werent involved, at least then we would have known it was going to be a spoof."

Just another movie by a corporation trying to profit off the Matrix's popularity.<br/><br/>The acting and character choices don't help.  The main character (hero and savior) is living ""off the grid"".

John came into this movie and decided to make a movie more like the first movie and he did very well in executing the steps. From the very beginning with each introduction of the terminator / human was perfect. All of the fight scenes were great and honestly, Cameron wishes he could top the crane scene! Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this is better than t2, but it's definitely a great action packed movie where you get to feel the pain, stress, excitement and depth of each character. His version of his terminator was very cool and kristana portrayed a very dark terminator. I recently went on a terminatorathon. And even salvation isn't as good as this and the two that followed are complete trash in comparison. Salvation used the same formula but not too much cgi which seems to be the dominant way to go but with high budget series in these mocks you would expect only the best cgi, but. Not in genesys and dark fate. I am 15 minutes into fate and I'm falling asleep. It's like every political statement had to be made and nothing else mattered in it's wokeness.

","Let's face it. The Terminator franchise has always been kitsch. It's ""classic"" kitsch but kitsch nonetheless. To expect something more from a franchise that started going down the cheesy sentimental route in its second entry is expecting way too much. These movies were meant to be fantastical thrill rides, and T3 is no exception to this rule. In fact, it's a solid blockbuster filled with great action, solid acting, (mostly) well timed humor and great special effects. I also thought it did a good enough job of justifying itself as a legitimate continuation of the universe. If you take this franchise too seriously you will be disappointed with this entry because you will be too preoccupied with how it's ""supposed"" to be.<br/><br/>All in all, solid entertainment. Too bad T4 & 5 had to suck so bad."
"blackwolf33914","6","2","3","20 February 2014"," What Happened to John?
","I just have one really important question for the filmmakers, what happened to John Connor?? In the second film he was only ten but was a really tough smart mouthed one, the fourth film had an adult tough John Connor that was believable that he was the same boy from T2. The third film however, for some strange reason, casted young adult Connor as a whim. Not only did he look nothing like a strong soldier but he also was mentally destroyed, seriously doubt anyone raised like he was raised would be complaining about be worth nothing or giving up on life. Luckily the fourth movie casted Christian Bale and gave Connor his balls back. That was my main problem with T3, besides how they made it the exact same way as the second one. Fell into the typical thought that if a movie was popular a sequel that's exactly the same plot will be an equal hit; most fans of a film series grows tired if they're all the same in thought. Schwarzenegger is once again great at playing everyone's favorite robot, he's the best part of this movie."

"byrann_gowan","7","2","3","17 February 2012"," Honestly...
","I liked this film. It wasn't as good as the original Terminator film, but it was popcorn entertainment, and for that reason, it was a decent film.<br/><br/>So, for the plot: John Conner, played this time by Nick Stahl, now in his early 20's, is living as a drifter, when all of a sudden, he is once again thrown into the world he tried to forget. A Terminatrix, played by Kristanna Loken, has set out to kill John Conner, while the Resistance decides to send another T-101 to protect Conner. Notice how I didn't put who played the T-101? That's because I don't have to tell you, because we all know who it is. So, while there are different elements to the movie, it is kind of similar to the first two films in that a Terminator comes to kill John Conner (or, in the first movie's case, his mother), and someone, or something, also comes from the past to be the hero of the film. Same old, same old, but it's still entertaining.<br/><br/>The actors did a good job. Kristanna Loken was quite sexy as the new Terminatrix who sets out to kill John Conner. Claire Danes is along for the ride as Kate who turns out to play an even more important role in the Resistance than even she realizes. Nick Stahl does a decent enough job as Connor, although he probably wouldn't have been my first pick. And, of course, who must come back to play the character we all know the most, but the Governator himself. Arnold's acting is kind of robotic, and while that seems like a bad thing, considering the fact that he does play a robot, it really works in this film.<br/><br/>The one thing that makes me rate it lower than the first two films is that there were quite a number of times in which I actually laughed at some of the one-liners. While they were funny, they really shouldn't have been there. It kind of made me wonder why the film was rated R in the first place to tell you the truth. But, some of them were funny, so I won't detract too much points from the film for that reason.<br/><br/>The action sequences though were top notch. This is the reason why I watched the film; I don't watch the Transformers movies for the acting because I know I'll be disappointed. The same thing kind of goes for the Terminator films, although the acting here is quite a bit better than that of the Transformers films. It is the action sequences that you want to see here, and so, if you go into this film expecting it to be about acting and dialogue, you might be a little disappointed. But, if you go in with popcorn entertainment on your mind, you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>All in all, though Terminator 3 by no means attains the pinnacle that was the second and the first movie, it is still a refreshing add-on to the Terminator franchise. An 8/10 for me."
"insomniac_rod","8","2","3","3 January 2010"," Less complex but more entertaining.
","""Rise of the Machines"" delivered exactly what I expected.<br/><br/>It's almost impossible to top the masterpiece that ""Judgment Day"" represents. The 1991 film has one of the most complex, intelligent, and interesting plots of all time.<br/><br/>""Terminator III"" is half popcorn fun and half tries to continue with the Terminator legacy.<br/><br/>There's plenty of extremely good action (all about the vehicles chase and the cemetery confrontation), nice humor (Arnie hasn't lost it!), good acting, and it gives a continuation to the Terminator saga. Die hard fans should be pleased and not try to compare it to part 1 and 2.<br/><br/>Sure, it's less complex and sacrifices the complex plot for entertainment, but still it's filled of interesting sequences that will remind you it's a Terminator movie.<br/><br/>Arnold is fine on his role. He still knows that it takes to be the Terminator. I didn't buy Nick Stahl's performance. I mean, I don't think John Connor should be represented as an anxious young man who barely demonstrates character. Come on! He's the leader of the resistance! Claire Danes is extremely beautiful and I liked the way her character's life changed all of a sudden in such a bizarre manner. Kristanna Lokken was creepy, effective, sexy as the Terminatrix. Excellent idea! The Direction is great. Pure candy for the eye with dynamic camera angles and a stylish look on it. It captures perfectly the whole machines rebellion.<br/><br/>The f/x are spectacular, impressive at some points. Oh money can buy happiness in cinema! The art direction and cinematography is really good but at some points it doesn't feels like a Terminator movie.<br/><br/>Still it's a very good addition to the series.

"zofos","6","2","3","13 July 2009"," Beauty & The Beast
","After Arnold Schwarzenegger destroyed the liquid metal T-1000 at the end of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" the world breathed a collective sigh of relief. Then the monster box-office takings came in and it was decided that SkyNet was far from finished. In ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" those crafty old machines try a different tack. Brawn had its chance to kill Sarah and John Connor and blew it. This time SkyNet send back a villainous creation that will use feminine wiles; the T-X or Terminatrix.<br/><br/>The T-X is embodied in the luscious form of Kristanna Loken. Some people had problems with her performance, but she does okay and she's very easy on the eye. Her abilities are good too, she squeals like a fax machine to hack in to the L.A. school computer and track down John Connor and his future lieutenants, she can inflate her chest at will to get out of a traffic fine (and what woman wouldn't love THAT?) and she can go toe-to-toe with Arnold in a scrap (she even emasculates his power by grabbing his testicles which is Arnold's cue to deliver a puzzled expression before she hurls him through the air). She also has an arm that can turn into a laser gun/flamethrower.<br/><br/>Her nemesis is also sent back through time and it is our old friend/enemy Arnold Schwarzenegger as a seriously outclassed T-800. Arnie was 56 when he made this film and he had undergone heart valve replacement surgery, so his excellent physical conditioning is remarkable.<br/><br/>Arnold, as in the other Terminator movies, arrives back in our time naked. So he heads to the nearest venue to acquire clothes: a strip club. However, this sequence goes too far into comedy, having Arnold demand the clothes of an effeminate male stripper and having him wear silly sunglasses for cheap laughs (his ""talk to the hand"" catchphrase is sooo late-90s and was already out of date by 2003). Also the forced appearance of Doctor Silberman after the graveyard shootout is a laboured joke and a sop to the fans that doesn't really work.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl plays John Connor and he goes through the whole movie looking like he's about to wet his pants. He didn't have the range as an actor to do justice to the role of John Connor (and he was totally unconvincing as an old John Connor in the future war sequence!) What a pity Edward Furlong blew the gig with his drug problems. He was perfect casting for Connor and had a good rapport with Schwarzenegger on screen. Linda Hamilton is sorely missed too.<br/><br/>The special effects look slightly ropey because James Cameron isn't calling the shots and pushing for perfection on this one. He would never have accepted the shots of the Hunter-Killers in the future war sequence, they look like something out of a video game. The script also suffers because Cameron isn't involved. The Terminator came to him in a nightmare, so it is his vision he was following completely. He knew exactly how the Terminator universe should look and he really cared about the characters. Other directors in the Terminator series are really just hacks for hire, using the franchise to get a leg up they don't deserve.<br/><br/>There are good things about T3; the crane chase, the Terminator tricking John Connor and Kate Brewster into saving themselves and the apocalyptic ending as seen from space which is awesome and unexpected. The protagonists in the other Terminator movies always managed to avert Judgment Day and it was a shock for audiences to see the heroes fail and for the world to be destroyed.<br/><br/>The Terminator is such a good story that it would be hard to screw it up. Even Terminator Salvation had flashes of brilliance (only flashes mind!). ""Terminator 3"" looks better now than it did when it came out. Many prefer it to ""Terminator Salvation"" as it has things that movie doesn't; a real Arnold, time travel and street battles in a present-day setting. Essentially, it is the end of a trilogy that James Cameron started back in 1984 (Salvation would abandon the structure, main setting and noir look of Cameron's movies). It was also the beginning of the end of Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career before he became Governor of California.<br/><br/>The action sequences are the best thing about T3. Even though the special effects look a bit ropey and there is hardly any future war in this one, it's still a fast-paced, watchable movie."

As for me, I liked this film as it was a great action film. It also continues the story and it was right to the point. The only thing I knock this movie for is how the story was told. Mostow only scratched the surface with the script and I felt like he needed to have things explained through the character interactions more. Yeah, Robert Brewster runs Skynet. However, Mostow should've had the T 101 explain this as it would have convinced people by shedding some light on the whole story.<br/><br/>This film is under-appreciated. The ending is great and now I want Terminator 4 to come out!!"

","Audacious adrenaline-laced action sequences, a resolute refusal to take itself seriously, and a surprise finale help the new apocalyptic Arnold Schwarzenegger science fiction epic ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" overcome its flat, formulaic, road show plot with its loquacious pseudo-scientific gobbledygook. No, director Jonathan Mostow's ""T-3"" doesn't top James Cameron's 1991 classic ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Although ""T-3"" lacks the narrative depth and complexity of ""T-2,"" this $170 million sequel based on Cameron's characters boasts more than enough muscle, mayhem, and momentum to make it worth watching though not altogether memorable. Mostow, who directed the W. W. II submarine saga ""U-571"" and the Kurt Russell wife-napping nail-biter ""Breakdown,""calls the shots this time and acquits himself well enough, considering how shallow the John Brancato & Michael Ferris screenplay remains throughout its lean, mean 109 minute running time. Aside from brawny Arnold Schwarzenegger as the protagonist, Earl Boen as Dr. Silverman qualifies as the only holdover from previous ""Terminator"" movies. Warner Brothers dumped Edward Furlong, whose real-life drunken antics cost him the John Connor role, and the studio replaced him with brooding-looking Nick Stahl of ""Bully"" and ""In The Bedroom."" Unfortunately, Stahl lacks any kind of charisma and he shares no chemistry with Claire Danes. For the record, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor has taken the long hike, too.<br/><br/>The nuts and bolts John Brancato & Michael Ferris screenplay (their credits include ""The Game"" and ""The Net"") picks up the plot about 10 years after ""T-2."" Leukemia has claimed Sarah Connor's life, and her grown-up son John (Nick Stahl) struggles to blend into the background and lives life ""off the grid."" He suspects that the future still holds something sinister for him, and he's right. As in ""T-2,"" ""T-3"" opens with a new Terminator, this time a Terminatrix, the T-X (svelte-looking super model Kristanna Loken of ""Academy Boyz""), stalking not only him but also those slated to act as his future lieutenants. Clearly, Mostow and his scribes must have seen Lara Flynn Boyle's mutant bug villainess in ""Men In Black 2"" and liked the idea. Like Robert Patrick's Terminator in ""T-2,"" this Terminatrix sports a new generation of liquid-metal skin as well as a lethal limb that she can turn into a plasma cannon, stiletto probe and power saw. As villainess go, this bombshell robo-babe is truly bad to the bone! She can crank up parked cars from afar and send them careening off down the road as if they were remote control toys. And she is not out to take prisoners either! This Terminatrix gives new meaning to stereotype about reckless women drivers in an early chase scene when she hijacks a gigantic construction crane truck and demolishes half of Los Angeles trying to run down John Connor. One of those lieutenants on her hit list is mild-mannered veterinarian Kate Brewster (Claire Danes of ""Brokedown Palace""). It seems that Kate and John shared a romantic moment together back in their high school days. Actually, it was the day before John's foster parents were mysteriously murdered and he vanished without a trace. The coincidences get even better. Now, it also seems that Kate's papa is a three-star general in charge of Skynet, an ultra-sophisticated computerized defense system which eventually out-smarts mankind and sends machines out to kill, kill, kill. No sooner has the action in ""T-3"" unfolded than things go on the Fritz. Least we not forget, in the middle of all this madness, another Terminator shows up in the form of Arnold Schwarzenegger. No, not the same one who died at the end of ""T-2,"" but he is just as obsolete as his earlier incarnation compared with the new Terminator. Nevertheless, Arnold makes life difficult for the Terminatrix. Kristanna Loken makes a terrific Terminatrix, too.<br/><br/>""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machine"" ranks as one of the most physically exhausting movies you'll see. You'll feel bruised and battered, especially after the battle between the two cyborgs in the bathroom. When was the last time you saw somebody tear an entire urinal out of the wall and smash somebody over the head with it? One of my favorite scenes occurred in the police cruiser when the Terminatrix --masquerading as Scott Mason—shoves her fist through the detective's chest and drives the car. Sadly, ""T-3"" doesn't provide Arnold with near enough clever one-liners as he had as either ""Terminator"" (1984) or ""T-2,"" but ""T-3"" still packs a hugely entertaining punch. Arnold's favorite like is ""Talk to the hand."" Mostow stages a memorable entrance for Arnold. He saunters into a bar during ladies night without a stitch on and insists that the male stripper give him all his clothes. The firefight at Greenlawn Cementery is interesting, too. When Arnold emerges from the crypt carrying the casket like a stick on his shoulder, the image reminded me of the Spaghetti western hero named Django who drags a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Incidentally, Arnold is toting not only firearms but also John Connor. The worst thing you can say about ""T-3"" is that it is a high-octane, swiftly-paced, straightforward melodrama with little of its predecessor's wit and wisdom. On the other hand, if you relish break-neck action movies with a high quota of slam-bang auto crashes, trigger-happy shoot-outs, and an over-the-top, face-to-face confrontation between two larger-than-life cyborgs titans, you should catch ""T-3"" on the big-screen!"
"TheHande","9","2","3","9 December 2007"," He's back!
","Terminator 3 was a positive surprise for me. It has all the essential hard-hitting action and narrative of the first two movies, but does away with the unnecessary emotionalism of the second. Terminator 3 is like T2 with more serious intent. I was particularly happy to see Arnold return to the role where he is ultimately at his best. Additionally the movie introduces a new cast of characters which manages to bring a truly more human element into the film. Additionally the action-sequences, while somewhat over-sized still keep you interested in the movie.<br/><br/>What was also a noticeable improvement over the last film is the emphasis on the story which progresses in an admirable but not a hectic pace. Also comedy evens out the film so that it doesn't turn into a monotonous experience. The films visual effects are also magnificent.<br/><br/>In some aspects the film will never be as classic as the Jim Cameron original. The soundtrack seems to have receded and I can't say I was attracted to the film's score. This is a bit of bummer since the film is otherwise so excellent. Particularly what I was happy with was the fact that we finally saw what the second movie should have shown us: Judgement Day. The film's climax is the ultimate pay-off to a fan such as me. Terminator 3 brings the glory back into the series even if it can never compete with the original."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","2","3","19 January 2007"," Risible machines
","People often complain that Terminator 2 was too kid-friendly  there were too many lame attempts at humour. Well, I've never had a problem with T2, preferring it to the original, but with Rise of the Machines the franchise goes too far. The most gut-wrenchingly awful bit has to be the infamous ""talk to da hand"" scene. What the hell? The Terminator should have smashed the teller's head into the counter, not sassed him.<br/><br/>And the scene that inspires this response is just as bad  the scene where a naked Arnie (still looking buff and questioning straight men's sexuality) walks into a club and gets 'dissed' by an exceedingly camp stripper. ""Woah, bitch, wait your turn,"" the imbecile says. And then when Arnie asks for his clothes we get the ""talk to the hand"" line. I don't care how deeply Edward Furlong annoyed you, or how hard you laughed when Arnie tried to express machine emotions, it's nowhere near as bad the series becoming like something you'd see on Ricki Lake.<br/><br/>Plus the stripping scene hits the nail far too hard on the head. Yes, we know that as much as he loves groping young ladies, Arnie is overwhelmingly gay, but the homosexuality present in his films should be less overt  where's the fun if it's handed to you on a plate? Commando certainly wouldn't have warranted repeated viewings or extended analysis if there'd been a scene where Bennett had caressed Matrix's toned ass. And then to further confound matters, there's a moment when, dressed like a leather daddy, Arnie puts on some Elton John sunglasses as 'Macho Man' plays in the background. The Terminator has become a laughing stock.<br/><br/>But this moment isn't a one off. At quite a few different points in time, Arnie seems to be sending himself and the film up. There's one bit where he's driving John Connor (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) to safety and he tells Danes to ""shut up"". But the line delivery is tongue in cheek. Who knew that machines could be knowingly mischievous? Another awful moment is when Arnie insists that he's not a robot but a cybernetic organism. Yay, the Terminator is PC now as well. (Next we'll probably get a black Terminator who insists he's a 'cybernetic organism of colour'.) <br/><br/>And yet another indignity Arnie has to face is when his system gets corrupted by the TX. He has to enter the William Shatner school of acting  writhing in pain as he fights against himself. It's a pretty lousy scene.<br/><br/>Not fairing any better is the TX  or the Terminatrix (vomit). She doesn't have the menace of the T-1000, plus she has a goofy machine arm that can spew flames and laser bolts. It's incredibly silly. And while Robert Patrick looked cold as ice and completely insane, Kristanna Loken looks like a bland, mildly bored fashionista  Patrick subverted the image of a cop, while Loken gets to wear flairs and high heels.<br/><br/>Another detail that illustrates how lacklustre Loken's performance is is the way she tilts her head when she controls other machines with her gnarly powers. This cliché has been worn to death. It's something you'd expect to see on a bad TV show, not a massive blockbuster. And although Loken gets to kill children and shoot people in the face, with one notable exception, all her slayings are rather dull. They lack flair. However, at least the exception makes up for it somewhat  in her only decent killing, the TX rams her fist through a man's chest and drives the car from the back seat; nice! <br/><br/>But this aside, the action is rather disappointing. Even the much lauded crane chase fails to get the blood pumping  it certainly pales in comparison to the storm drain chase in T2. And the TX/T-101 fight is a poor imitation of the fight at the end of Judgment Day and the shootout in the graveyard is a second rate version of the similar scene at the Cyberdyne offices. It just doesn't have the same intensity. And while part of this is due to the fact that the film's too light-hearted, it's also because the film desperately misses Brad Fiedel's score  the music is completely anonymous.<br/><br/>Another problem is that there's far too much obvious CGI. Just take the fight between the T-101 and the TX in the toilets. There are far too many moments when you can clearly see that it's badly rendered computer models that are getting thrown about. It takes you out of the film. And speaking of CGI, why is it that the effects in T2 look so much better than the ones here? The damage that the TX takes isn't as convincing as the hits that the T-1000 takes, the brief glimpse that we get of the endoskeletons are crap and Skynet's vehicles and weaponry are awful. Maybe it's because T2, as pioneering as it was in its use of CGI, used a lot of physical effects too. Here you just feel that the filmmakers have got lazy. (By the way, what's with those crappy pot-bellied tank things? Whoever designed them should hang their head in shame.) <br/><br/>About the only thing that works in the film is the ending. It's much better than it has any right to be. But it doesn't erase the crap that comes before it. Rise of the Machines is a poor film."

","Terminator 3 was very enjoyable - it was just like its two predecessors except more modern, high-tech, and with a far bigger budget. Instead of just being a high-tech action flick which forgot entirely about the Terminator plot and only had the characters and situations it invented (and no new scenarios), this film continues the Terminator legacy with a new character (the T-X, who is female and far more high-tech than Arnie), a new plot and the promise of a rather uncertain future for John Connor. It isn't a classic and certainly not the most critically well-received of the Terminators, but it manages to bring the golden oldies into the 21st century and make over $400 million in the process.<br/><br/>I have to say this - I enjoyed it. Big explosions, exploding cars and robots and guns (and anything to do with action) are certainly my thing, and this film had no shortage of them. The superbly high-tech T-X was rather squarely acted, but she had cunning and villainy and was a hugely menacing villain. The Terminator himself becomes an ally of John Connor this time round (which most people certainly weren't predicting), and he sacrifices himself to let John Connor and Katherine Brewster live - he is the main hero this time. The ending is surprisingly powerful and meaningful, and ensures that this film is more than just standard action fare - it is part of the Terminator series in its own right and deserves to be remembered as a part of this monumental film legacy.<br/><br/>On the whole - Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines isn't going to be remembered as a classic, but bad robots, cunning villains and so-called ""vital to the Earth"" human characters ensure that this film is a Terminator. Explosions and death galore - this is hugely enjoyable. Spiffing! 8/10"

","Fanatic fans of the 2 previous Terminators may be disappointed, but I think there are no big reasons to be. We need to overlook some logical mistakes, and then we have here a good film and blockbuster for summer night. There are many actions such as scene with the fire department-car, these are one of the main parts of the film. The plot-line is only support for the show. Regarding actors, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes are average, Arnie plays his standard (like the old times :) and Kristanna Loken as marvelous T-X didn't need some special acting, she did empty face good :). So if you don't have big demands, you will not be disappointed..<br/><br/>BTW Kristanna Loken is very cute :)"
"Anonymous781","9","2","3","8 October 2006"," Forced to Give It a 9
","*May Contain Spoilers* Okay, on with the review. I find myself compelled to give this movie a 9 for the things I did like in it. I didn't care for the humor attempts in the movie, like Arnold telling the gas station attendant to talk to the hand or whatever, or when he put on those star-sunglasses in the beginning. I think these movies should remain serious, and shouldn't be tainted with stupid humor, but that's just my opinion. Outside of this, I thought the female terminator could have (and should have) been a lot more attractive. Further, I wished that the actor who played John Connor in T2 was used again to make T3. The new guy just couldn't replace the old John Connor (not that the new guy's performance was THAT bad, its just he can't replace the original). The other thing I didn't really care for that comes to mind was how quick the new T-100 terminator got his sass mouth. The old terminator was much more serious, and had to be coached by the then-young John Connor before he picked up his attitude. The T-100 seemed to do this with very little if any provocation whatsoever from John or John's spouse. Aside from that, sex would be good.. between John and his spouse, and it didn't happen. It shouldn't be raunchy or distasteful, but should be passionate and emotional - and done in a way to further the film. Aside from all these shortcomings I saw in the film, (I kind of think there were more I am forgetting), I have to rate this a 9 because it wasn't a non-enjoyable movie, and there were some qualities that I liked to it, such as the twilightzone-like thoughts that come to mind when one thinks about time travel and all the wondefully interesting ideas to play around with that seem to follow the subject around."

","... in the very sense of the word. Some jokes like ""talk to the hand"" are hilarious but the whole movie holds on to an aging Terminator, odd!<br/><br/>Technically the film is great and the special effects are very good as well and to be honest, Kristina Lokken is easier on the eye than Arnie or the T-1000, but overall the film is weak and that is mainly due to the story itself. <br/><br/>After the very successful sequel from 1991 all had been said, the world had been saved and this could have been a prime example of how not to spoil a good idea to bring the Terminator back once.<br/><br/>Anyway, the damage is done!"

"Hellrazr360","8","2","3","12 February 2006"," Awkward But Fun Twist To The Terminator Movies
","By the time a movie series reaches its third installment the series is considered a disgrace because of the most recent addition. While some fans of the Terminator movies would like to ignore what Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines has to say it's still an exciting watch.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous Terminator films, T3 puts the focus on big-bang action scenes rather than storytelling. In the regard of its action, T3 is a real thrill ride. From the opening sequence revealing a short but impressive look at the nuclear war to the inevitability set for Judgment Day, T3 serves up a good pace of tension-filled and occasionally humorous action. Not only do these scenes make T3 worth watching multiple times but it also gives the movie the extra points it needs to be above-average, and even a great movie.<br/><br/>However, T3 makes compromises a strong story for these impressive action scenes. This will immediately turn Terminator fans off as the previous Terminator films were smart and took the time to develop a strong storyline. While the plot in T3 isn't necessarily bad, it makes a big mistake right from the beginning: Being made in the first place. Since T3 was made it was inevitable that the producers intended for Judgment Day to still happen, it makes the costly choice of taking T2's excellent ending, laughing in its face and tossing it away.<br/><br/>With that, T3 is, on paper-a typical action flick with a mixed up plot tossed in. While the idea of making the ending of T2 pointless by its own rules is a big mistake, T3 still comes out strongly for what it is. This is one of the sci-fi movies that comes out as an exception to the standard that action-focused movies suck. Part of this is because that it still holds on to the formula of Judgment Day set by the first Terminator. But this rattles the viewers as T3 teases us with the idea of another Terminator movie that, if made, would be the real Judgment Day movie.<br/><br/>So all things considered, T3 isn't a bad movie. In fact, it's actually a great movie as it has some cool and awesome action and does stay true to the original Terminator formula. Just that T3 makes the risk of even being released by toying with T2's ending about stopping Judgment Day that it loses points. Otherwise, T3 is a movie that regular Terminator fans will more than likely enjoy for what it's worth and under the flow movie sequels usually follow."

","I am a fan of the original Terminator film, and enjoyed the second in the franchise, yet unfortunately Terminator 2: Judgment Day lacked in humor and life and seemed dumbed down for us stupid Americans who just like watching things blow up. This third installment Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is one heck of a lot smarter than the second film and maybe just as smart as the first, it is much funnier and the acting is better than I thought was possible with Arnold Swchartzenegger(Or how ever you spell it) in a lead roll. It may not by quite as fun as the original but it passes up the second. The screenplay has much wittier dialogue than the films before and the characters are better developed. The direction isn't James Cameron but is still quite good. The visual effects are some of the best I have ever seen, they are fantastic. A lot better than I could have hoped for, watch it. Now I kinda even hope that he'll be back again."

","There is no denying the fact that the Terminator films are the crowning glory of Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career.When I read that part 3 was to hit the theaters soon,I was beside myself with excitement:would this be as good as the previous two ? After I saw it,I had to say:this is the best one of the three! First,Schwarzenegger is in better form than ever.Ten years since the last Terminator movie and who can even notice ?He looks as good,as invincible and what's more,he is more ""human "".The script provides him with a number of one-liners that will surely cause a lot of laughs all over the world.Director Jonathan Mostow does a great job,and frankly, I must say that he has surpassed James Cameron .By introducing the "" Terminatrix"",he has taken the action to a whole new level.Kristanna Loken plays Arnold's ultimate antithesis,and she does a fantastic job.Throughout the film,she maintains the expression of a ruthless,brutal assassin who will never stop until she achieves her objective: to kill John Connor.She looks far more convincing than Robert Patrick did in the previous installment.It is a contributing factor to this film's superiority to the other two of the trilogy.The special effects are incredible:this time, special effects genius Stan Winston has not relied on CGI to get the adrenaline rising,but uses real robots to usher in Judgement Day.The result is a fantastic battle-scene between Arnold and the robots,and you are left thirsting for more. Nick Stahl does his best to look and act like the John Connor as a grown-up,but I don't think he leaves a lasting impression.It is Claire Danes playing Catherine Brewster,Connors' future wife, who takes the cake as far as acting is concerned-what's more,she is the only one except Arnold who fires at the attacking horde of robots,prompting Stahl's remark :""You remind me of my mother !""Danes looks more fit to lead the resistance than Stahl.If there is a fourth installment(and I pray there will be ! ),she should be cast again as Catherine Brewster.I used to think that T2 could never be surpassed,but this film proved me wrong.Outstanding work,Jonathan Mostow !"

","I have come across quite a few people who disliked this movie. Their reasons are numerous: plot holes, it destroys the continuity, etc. I could go on and on but I will not do that here.<br/><br/>I think the biggest problem that most people had going into this film was that they were expecting it to be something that it wasn't. They were expecting this movie to be another Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This movie, I believe, was never meant to be that. It did have likenesses to the other movies such as action sequences, time travel, etc. However, this movie needs to be judged on its' own merits and not that of the two movies preceding it, to do this is about as intelligent as judging a child against the performance of his/her siblings.<br/><br/>I think that all parties involved in the making of this film did an excellent job in making a film that held up rather well. A good job was done of creating something that added to the Terminator storyline but still was original enough to be a good movie in its own right. Some familiar concepts in the Terminator Universe were taken and expanded on or better defined. It seems that most of the problems that I have heard from others who have viewed the film have come from their own preconceived ideas about what certain aspects of the film or Terminator Universe should be and not from the film itself.<br/><br/>Therefore my recommendation about this movie is to simply take the film for what it is, entertainment. This is a good phrase to sum up what I think. As entertainment this movie holds up rather well. Take it for what it is and enjoy it. Don't beat your brain out trying to understand it because it is only a movie. Overall I think this was a good movie 7/10"

","I have to say that I was not expecting a great movie with T3 ""Rise of the Machines"".  I was biased, thinking James Cameron was necessary to make it a success, but I was wrong.  The Terminator Story has taken a life of its own! It has evolved from the simple story-line of a single terminator trying to kill Sarah Connor to Skynet trying to kill all human life.  It is huge and the potential is vast.  Arnold Schwarzenegger's presence on screen was incredible.  For 55 years old, he is in excellent shape.  I highly recommend this movie to folks like me who don't think any movie can top T1 and T2. This movie isn't meant to top it, just continue it, and it does that very well."

","This movie was simply awful.  The first 2 Terminator movies were pieces of scifi history.  This contrived piece of crap is nothing more than a standard action flick.  Arnold delivered comedic line after comedic line after comedic line.  That might not have been so offensive if this was Commando II.  However, for a Terminator film, it's insulting to its legacy.  The absence of Cameron and Hamilton is noticeable, and Stahl and Daines (who appears to be 35 now) are unconvincing, at best.  Arnold attempts to carry the movie with standard action stunts and one liners, but there's no meat to this sandwich, folks.  The story is lame, and the characters are worse. The ending isn't a surprise to anyone familiar with the scifi genre, wherein surprise ""unhappy endings"" abound.  If you can, avoid it at all costs. Personally, I hope Arnold doesn't come back for any future cinematic outings.  Not until he's gotten a better agent."
"mnemosyne23","10","2","3","2 July 2003"," Awe. SOME. This is a MUST SEE MOVIE
","Yesterday, my friend and I were discussing how bad ""T3"" was going to be. ""Just a shameless chance to make money off a dead franchise,"" we said. ""One more cog in Hollywood's sucky-sequel routine.""  Of course, being ""Terminator"" fans, we knew we were going to go see it anyway, good or bad. So tonight, I sat down, leaned back, and waited to be bored.<br/><br/>Instead, I was totally blown away.<br/><br/>""T3: Rise of the Machines"" picks up the story of John Connor (Nick Stahl), the protagonist of ""T2"" and the future savior of mankind.  Immediately, from the first words of the film, I knew I was in for something more than just another action movie; another ""shameless"" plug for a ""dead franchise."" Rather than taking the usual Hollywood route and placing John in a high profile career - lawyer, doctor, car salesman - ""T3"" reveals that John is a drifter, aware of his destiny and unconvinced that he is really as safe as we were all led to believe at the end of ""T2.""  Naturally, since this is the third movie and we're only two minutes into the film, we know that he's correct - he isn't safe.  Something is going to happen to make John Connor realize his destiny, or else put it to rest entirely.<br/><br/>
That something is the T-X (Kristanna Loken)- aka the Terminatrix - a state-of-the-art Terminator sent from the future (once again) to destroy John Connor, but with an added twist: she's there to kill his lieutenants as well.  All and any who are an aid to John in his future battle against the machines have become targets, including Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), a girl John knew as a child.  Helping to protect John and Kate from the T-X is the inimitable T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a carbon copy of the Terminators that tried to murder Sarah Connor in the original film, and then went on to save her and John in ""T2.""<br/><br/>Nick Stahl turns in a touching and nuanced performance as John Connor.  He doesn't want to accept his destiny, but when it rears its ugly head, he falls into the role of hero with ease and aplomb - you can see the emerging leader he will become.  Claire Danes, as always, is believable as the spunky but flustered Kate, who spends half the movie believing she's been kidnapped.  Arnold Schwarzenegger brings the T-800 to life with the same complexity as in ""T2,"" giving touches of humor throughout the film that sound perfectly natural coming from the unemotional machine.  Kristanna Loken is the only weak part of the film - she tries too hard to be a carbon copy of Robert Patrick's menacing T1000 from ""T2,"" and ends up looking like a bad Lara Croft impersonator, scowling under her eyebrows throughout most of her scenes.  Whereas Patrick was gifted with a lean body, chiseled features, and bone-chilling, serial killer eyes that made you BELIEVE he could kick Arnold around like a rag doll, it's difficult to imagine this slip of a girl even being able to give him a papercut.<br/><br/>Luckily for us, the T-X seems almost an afterthought throughout the film. Most of the storyline is focused around the trio of Stahl, Danes and Schwarzenegger, as they struggle to stop Skynet from becoming self-aware and destroying the planet.  But before you start thinking this movie is too cerebral, rest assured, the pacing is fast and furious, full of enough gunfire, explosions and insane car chases to make your eyes boggle.  One particular chase scene close to the beginning of the movie - which appears to leave half of Los Angeles in a pile of rubble - is breathtaking in its intensity.  It's like the world's worst early morning rush hour traffic, where every other car on the road is LITERALLY out to get you.<br/><br/>This movie is rated R for a reason, and that reason is BLOOD.  But the violence is given a Hitchcockian twist - a spatter of blood across a picture frame while the sound of a dentist's drill whirs in the background.  Your imagination is enough to make you shudder or jump in your seat - director Jonathan Mostow doesn't feel the need to swamp the screen with wanton violence.  So while the body count is on a par with the first two films, it doesn't FEEL so violent.<br/><br/>I also appreciated the fact that they didn't feel the need to indulge in unnecessary ""cheese cake"" when the T-X first arrived on the scene.  Yes, this film has an R-rating, and yes, the primary audience is going to be young men, ages 18-34, so I was expecting full frontal nudity.  But the entrance of T-X is tastefully done, with strategically positioned shadows hiding the ""naughty bits.""  I think Arnold gets to flash more skin than Ms. Loken!<br/><br/>Most fun of all, this movie isn't afraid to poke fun at itself and its predecessors.  There are moments throughout the film that hint back to events in the previous movies with a tongue-in-cheek playfulness, such as a recurring gag involving the T-800's sunglasses, made so famous in ""T2."" These humorous moments don't detract from the film - they add to it, by reminding the audience of just why they love the series so much.  More than once, the entire theater was laughing or clapping at what was going on onscreen, and you can't ask for better response than that at a movie like this.<br/><br/>""T3"" is just... phenomenal.  It's hard to put into words just what is so GOOD about it.  All I can say is, if you'd asked me yesterday if I wanted to see a ""T4,"" I would have given you an uncategorical, ""NO!""  But today, as I sit here, if you were to ask me the exact same question, I'd stare at you and say, ""What, you mean you DON'T?""  It's THAT good, folks.  It turned this cynic into a believer, and it didn't even break a sweat."

","The first Terminator was great, the second was even better, and of course, twelve years later, I had my reservations about this installment of the series. My reservations are now laid to rest.<br/><br/>Terminator is an amazing movie from start to finish, blending seamlessly traditional action, stunts, and fine elements of CGI which many times, you don't even notice is there. It successfully advances the plot to new areas, and raises interesting questions, while holding true to the many one liners the series is known for. Add to this a hot new terminator who can make her chest grow at will and get it on with the old T-800 in a bathroom, and you've got a good time on your hands.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 gets better as it progresses until it ends with a climactic ending which is both incredible, and shocking. The series can only get better from here, and I have no doubt that the next installment will bring a whole new light to where it's going from here. If I have only one question to raise about this movie, it's where the 175 million dollars went... besides Arnold's pocket that is."

Still great stunt work, especially in the first part of the film. In fact, the first half uses up most of the adrenaline of the movie, which deflates the climax a bit.

","""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" (2003) is the third movie in the Terminator franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>Absolutely first of all: sorry to say, but this movie is far away from the quality of the first and second Terminator. If you hold them dear, think twice whether you really want to see this movie. If you still do, keep reading.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 aims for the same level of action extravaganza that Terminator 2 had, and while it doesn't reach quite the same height, some scenes are fairly thrilling and can certainly satisfy cravings for guns and explosions. However, that is about the only positive aspect of Terminator 3, as the rest of the movie doesn't come close to the same cinematography, special effects, characters or emotions as the previous installments. It is all over the place.<br/><br/>The most disappointing downside is the lack of charisma. John Connor in Terminator 2 has now become a homeless, college drop-out burglar who is roaming shops for some easy booze and painkillers. The new Terminator is a very sexualized femme fatale whose liquid metal body can fire laser rockets. The other protagonist, Kate, is mainly there to ask questions and push the narrative forward, and our beloved Schwarzenegger does his best in trying to live up to his former glory. Terminator 3 is very much like any other action movie from the early 00's, and suffers from uncharismatic characters with very small arcs and very little dynamic.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the action is acceptable. But Terminator consists of so much more.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a displeased 6/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."

","What makes for a great film? Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines (T3) presents a good example for discussion. Take a relatively decent plot with a subtle twist at the end, base the movie on an old but classic (meaning a 30 year old sci fi concept - see ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"") and though in some dramatic elements and special effect chase and hunt scenes and you have an American film formula that is hard to beat, at least in America. T3 represents all that is American. The good American individual hero versus the bad, evil enemy (in this case Machines), at plenty of action, a female counterpart (in both good and evil roles), use some emotional scenes for depth, a bit of humor, use a simple and straightforward plot for the America mental attention span and you have a good entertaining movie production that also makes people feel both good and bad at the same time. Like Jaws, this particular American formula its American consumption diets like candy. And with as guilty of pleasure as may be described, T3 seems to work well in its almost seamless, consistently riveting scenes. With only a number of doubtless unrealistic scenes (pauses for dramatic effect where the characters are really supposed to continue running for their very lives and the unbelievable law enforcement chase scenes and rather extraordinary demolition of property visuals), T3 seems to pull off enough of the summer bubblegum fantasy theme as to make everything acceptable. Eight stars out of ten for decent, if not really original, action and drama."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","1","1","11 July 2019"," He's back again.
","Essentially, 'Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003)' combines the philosophies of the first two movies, positing that the future isn't set but that certain events are, perhaps, inevitable. In this way, it presents a natural and rather interesting extension to the previously established narrative. It's actually a solid story filled with nice character moments and generally intriguing ideas. It also makes a few bold choices which end up being vital to its success. Obviously, it's not as tight as the first or as exciting as the second, and it's not as well-written as either, but it's a competent, surprisingly effective tale nevertheless. Generally, it is a little silly, though. Usually, this isn't too much of an issue; the action scenes are as energetic and engaging as ever, if more outlandish and occasionally downright goofy, and the tone isn't as unbalanced as you might think. Sometimes, however, you do get the sense that things are a little too over-the-top - especially in comparison to its consistently grounded predecessors. There are a few, sporadic moments of comedy that don't quite work. Likewise, some of the 'serious' stuff is a little too serious to be taken seriously (I'm looking at you, opening narration). I think the pacing helps you overlook a lot of these issues, as the thing really does move. As I said before, it's entertaining, too. To say he didn't want to be here, Schwarzenegger is doing a decent job. The character is written as if he has his learning capabilities already unlocked (see the director's cut of 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)') but that's not too much of a leap. His counterpart is presented as a machine designed to kill machines and does, indeed, feel like she outmatches him. The design of some of her elements seems a little strange - as does the overall 'rigid endoskeleton/ liquid-metal skin' combo - but she's menacing enough. It helps that the chase is pretty much constant this time, essentially being the driving force behind even the more 'grand-scheme' plot. Some of the effects-work leans too far into early-2000s CG to be believable but there's just enough practicality, especially in the car-chase scene, to make up for that. Generally, the flick is much more enjoyable than you might think. It rounds off the narrative of the 'trilogy' rather well, even including some decent overarching character development, and feels fairly complete. Of course, it isn't as good as either of the films it follows. However, it's undeniably entertaining, despite being silly, and that counts for quite a bit. 7/10"

","When this movie came out during the busy summer of 2003, it marked Arnold's last movie before he entered politics as Governor of California for two terms before Jerry Brown took over and served for two terms before Gavin Newsom took over recently. This movie is notable for launching the career of Kristanna Loken, a model who is probably the sexiest Terminator alive. Claire Danes pre homeland stars in this film along with other stars. Lots of good action scenes make up for a weird plot about the rise of the machines as well as male terminator vs female terminator.

I thought the plot was ""believable"", the acting good (with Arnold being Arnold, of course), and of course, the action and special effects were fantastic. Many of the jokes require familiarity with T2, so perhaps that is why people may have rated it lower, because without the humor, I would drop my 9 to a 7 or 8.

","This is a good pop-corn movie but that's not a good show when your elder siblings are the beloved early 90s blockbuster Terminator 2 and the artistically amazing Terminator. Compared to the high marks to the originals this one falls short but that's not really a bad thing. Terminator 3 has a number of impressive action sequences, including one that features two crashing helicopters and another in which the T-101 and T-X go at it, one-on-one. But none is more impressive than the crane chase, where the world's largest crane goes crashing through everything in its path in an out-of-control attempt to (literally) run down John and Kate. The plot isn't as brawny as the first two films either but it would help if the audience is aware of the Terminator Universe. All in all a good film."

It could've been much better than what it already was, but at the same time, it could've quite easily been much worse. In the end, we were left with this. The movie is still very interesting to follow. The story is pretty good. But what I'm truly disappointed about is why it took such a long time to make Terminator 3 after the success of Judgement Day - that always baffled me. It looked like a third movie was doubtful or something. If Terminator 3 was going to be made, they should have made it within five years after Judgement Day. The title - Rise of the Machines - wasn't a bad title for the third movie. I don't know what else you could've came up with instead.

"mgruebel","6","1","1","30 July 2015"," Better if you're not too familiar with 1 & 2
","This is actually a pretty good action flick. The director spends some time on characterization, the chemistry between characters is pretty good, and there are plenty of amazing chase scenes (that crane truck seemed to lose more wheels than could possibly be on one when it crashed!), android action, etc.<br/><br/>The real problem with the film is ""more of the same."" We already had a Terminator movie with a shape-changing robot pursuing a human hero protected by an older model electromechanical robot with a human skin surface. So now the hero is in his twenties instead of his teens. So what. The movie felt more like a reboot of Terminator 2, but without the masterful touch of Cameron. Not to criticize Jonathan Mostow too much: it is well-directed.<br/><br/>The gruff ""I'm reluctantly getting to like you"" chemistry between Nick Stahl (as the human here) and Claire Danes (as his future wife) works well. Comic relief is provided in well-times doses, such as when Arnold Schwarzenegger (the good robot) informs Danes that she will have Stahl's babies in the near future, at a time when she is decidedly in the ""reluctant"" phase of the relationship. There are also nice cinematic devices, such as the gradual progression from night to twilight to dawn to day during the first big chase. Very expertly done.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of little plot holes, many of them associated with the idea of doing the same thing a third time over. If the machines of the future can send three terminators back, why not even more all over the place? And why is a machine as cold-blooded and efficient as the icy-beautiful Kristanna Loken so inefficient at doing its job? If you need to change from ""boyfriend"" to ""Terminatrix"" before you can use your weapon on Dane, just stay ""boyfriend,"" get next to Dane, then wring her little neck! However, none of the holes are absolutely critical to the plot, which sails along just fine to a climax at an accelerator and a US deep cover installation.<br/><br/>I'd say for someone not into the Terminator series, this would be a ""7"" action flick. For someone who adored Arnold and Cameron since 1984's first installment, it'll probably be a 5 for deja vu, seen that done better. So I'll award the average of these scores."

","Terminator 2 had such a perfect ending, but given how successful it was a the box-office it was inevitable another sequel would be churned out. While predictably, this one, directed by Jonathan Mostow, would never be in the same league as the first two, it's still a better film that perhaps was expected.<br/><br/>This one goes for balls-to-the-wall action, and on that level it certainly delivers. A visual spectacular, with the highlight being a destructive vehicle chase with the T-X driving a crane. The special effects are cool, though at times a tad too obvious. For about 2 hours, the film does not let up.<br/><br/>It becomes clear though, that action and special effects are about all we're going to get. That and silly one-liners. Arnie makes a welcome return - of sorts, though he's undermined whenever scenes are played for laughs. Kristanna Loken is creepily lithe as the T-X, and is perhaps the best reason to watch it. Though little more than a variation of the T-1000, she still makes for a worthy addition to the cyborg killers Skynet keeps churning out. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes however aren't really that likable as John Connor and Katy Brewster. What this film lacks is the presence of someone like Kyle Reese in the first, and the buffed up Sarah Connor of the second. Indeed it's lacking the heart and soul of the first two preferring to toss that aside in favour of non-stop thrills.<br/><br/>While still very entertaining for most of it's way, at the climax, it starts to fall apart somewhat, and the final face-off between Arnie and the T-X is pretty weak. The ending however is quite a brave move, a brief attempt to recapture some of the bleak tone of the first."
"Al_The_Strange","8","1","1","4 February 2013"," ""Judgment Day is inevitable.""
","As thrilling as the first two Terminator films were, they made up a rather complete duology. I still always dreamed that a third movie should be made, to take the franchise into thrilling new directions. About ten or eleven years after T2, this film finally came out, with surprisingly little enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Outside of James Cameron's hands, it's not quite the same. I can't deny that it's missing a certain charm, or perhaps a certain pathos, that makes the first two films work so well. Regardless, T3 has its share of excitement. The car chase in the opening act, featuring a crane that wrecks a huge number of cars and one whole building, is an excellent and awesome thing to watch. The film maintains really fast pacing with a frequent number of chases and fights. It's also loaded up with quite a bit of silly comedy. I could see audiences loathing the lighter tone of the film, but I think it's a real hoot. Even though these scenes make the film lightweight, it still has serious moments, especially during its final scenes.<br/><br/>The film starts off looking quite similar to the other two movies, with two terminators coming into the past, one to kill and the other to protect. It quickly covers thrilling new ground, showcasing a lost and troubled John Connor who winds up literally trapped in some rather amusing situations. When the actual Judgment Day hits, it becomes a mad rush. There's not much room for character or theme development, and when there is, some of the scenes might come off as wimpy (especially in the way John Connor whines and threatens to kill himself in one scene). Regardless, it's a serviceable story with a few surprising twists, even if it doesn't have the same depth or feeling as its predecessors.<br/><br/>The film looks slick, with solid photography and editing. Acting is not bad: Arnold Schwarzenegger returns with a tongue-in-cheek portrayal of his iconic character. Nick Stahl does his best to match up with Edward Furlong's portrayal of John Connor; despite being a little unlikable as a character, I think his performance is admirable. Claire Danes and Kristanna Lokken are both fun to watch. Writing is okay; there are a few lines that I wish were expanded upon. This production has plenty of good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects look great most of the time, and a little weak in other spots. Music is pretty good.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this as a rental.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)"
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","9","1","1","30 December 2012"," Still entertaining even if Cameron isn't at the wheel
","We all know that after Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Arnold Schwarzenegger stated that he would not continue the Terminator franchise unless James Cameron was directing. Apparently he did not follow through on his word. Schwarzenegger is back as his metal counterpart to save John Connor once more from being killed off so he can save the human race from Skynet becoming self-aware.<br/><br/>And even though James Cameron did not even take part in this film at all, director Jonathan Mostow looks like he put a lot of work into this less appreciated sequel too. John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now in his 20's and feels depressed because he can't do anything with his life. Perhaps the reason was that judgment day didn't happen...yet, but he didn't know that. This time, Schwarzenegger comes back as a modified Terminator, the T-850 to protect Connor from his strongest opponent yet; the T-X. <br/><br/>The T-X is played by model Kristanna Loken. Loken makes her character quite believable and lethal at the same time. Although she barely shows any emotion, she looks like she had a good time being her character. Killing victims and all. Loken is part of what makes this sequel work. Even Earl Boen (Dr. Silberman) has an appearance for a brief time to treat the fans of the franchise. The action is still very intense and the violence is still very brutal.<br/><br/>The only weak points I see is Marco Beltrami's film score and Nick Stahl. Beltrami does recall Brad Fiedel's theme from the first two films but his rendition gets lost in the softer more sentimental scenes. As for Stahl, perhaps he wasn't the best choice as an older John Connor. His looks don't quite make out as a rough and tough leader. But all around, this sequel still packs a punch.<br/><br/>The third terminator film has good performances from Loken and Schwarzenegger. Even if it's missing James Cameron."

","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a science fiction action film directed by Jonathan Mostow.It features Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken. It is the second sequel to The Terminator.<br/><br/>Set ten years after the events of 1991's Terminator 2: Judgement Day, the screenplay finds Connor living on the streets as a common laborer. Sarah Connor, his mother, has since died, and their efforts in the second film have not stopped the creation of SkyNet artificial intelligence network. As he will still become the leader of the human resistance, Connor is once again targeted by a Terminator sent from the future by SkyNet. This new Terminator, T-X, is a female and is more powerful than any of her predecessors. To protect Connor, the human resistance sends a new T-101 back from the future.<br/><br/>With a reported budget of $172 million, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines starts in high gear and never slows down.It tells the simple yet compelling story of a very old piece of equipment that refuses to go away. Its name is Arnold Schwarzenegger, and, as famously promised, he's back, and at his uncharismatic best, too.Although it never reaches the heights of the second movie, it is a welcome addition to the Terminator franchise."
"knifebat","Null","1","1","20 May 2012"," T3 is it that bad?
","It seems like the public opinion of this film is that it is the worst of the 4 Terminator films. The budget, the production, everything is done big. Almost too big. Many people hate the story because they found it confusing or it didn't make any sense. The reason why I enjoyed this film is because I was able to detach it from T2. It sounds silly to do so because they are part of the same franchise but T2 to me was a global phenomenon. I think that when T2 came out back then, it pretty much caught everyone's eye. So to compare it to a film like that is a pretty tall order. So how do I see T3? The romance between John Connor and Kate Brewster could have been much better, but it was a nice concept, nice to see Arnold back even though he seems to have completely stopped trying to act robotic at all in this one. The concept of the TX a female Terminator that hunts other Terminators is very interesting. The plot with the so called twist ending at the end was not well done, But overall to me this is a film that I call easy watching. This is another film that also had a ton of potential. In the trivia section it is stated that Vin Diesel, Shaq, Famke, and Chyna was considered for the role of the TX. I think it would have been great if they had casted all of them. Arnold would have to defeat each one, and hopefully each one would have a unique special ability instead of cramming multiple abilities into one like they did the TX. So if you keep your expectations low, your getting an average action flick with an A class mega budget, so I had fun with this one."

","As much fun as these movies are, whatever connection they had to the writings of Harlan Ellison (acknowledged in the credits of the original movie) are gone. Unlike the two previous movies, this one spans only one day. And what a day it is. We have here a total commitment to special effects and explosions instead of any character development or plot. Arnold looks damn good nearly twenty years after the original film, to his credit, and his acting is, well, predictably Arnold. In both T2 and T3, he breaks the machine character in several scenes and uses ""human"" tones and expressions when communicating with the real humans. Claire Danes' character is never really developed beyond the confused girl and veterinary assistant about to be married to a man she is not quite sure she wants to marry, although there is one fairly comedic scene where John Connor looks at her and says ""You remind me of my mother."". Earl Boen reprising his role as Dr. Silberman is priceless, especially when he spots the Terminator. Nick Stahl as John Connor just does not pan out. Edward Furlong in the second movie figured out the true nature of the character when the Terminator explains his mother has been telling the truth. We watch a transition from angry kid to the potential leader of the resistance. Stahl remains the man in denial of his destiny right up to the end. Kristanna Loken never breaks character, she is the perfect Terminator, driven, relentless and uncaring. There are some other inconsistencies, mostly the hit list T-X is following in Los Angeles, which would seem to be unnecessary since LA will be one of the cities wiped out when Judgment Day occurs. But to the credit of the art department, the special effects alone in this film are worth a look. Rated R for nudity, violence, and language, T3 is only collectible if you own the rest of the films and are obsessed with keeping the set intact."

","Its not very often that film sequels can maintain a franchise and from personal experience, films seem to get worse as more sequels are made. This film didn't disappoint. It may not be as good as the original two but it still maintains great acting, the original back plot and a whole new original storyline of its own.<br/><br/>I didn't expect this film to be as good for several reasons 1. being the characters are different. Apart from Arnie, the entire cast has changed and it felt a little empty without the actress who plays Sarah Connor. I was a little disappointed that she had been written out but as the storyline progressed, I realised it seemed necessary. The acting in this film was as good as ever and the actors really pulled off their characters.<br/><br/>You'd have thought the writers would have ran out of storyline by the third film but they've just proved me wrong. The storyline works well alone, is unique, and fits well with the back plot already in place. If you had never seen the previous films, you'd probably be able to watch this one and follow it fairly easily.<br/><br/>However, I have noticed that they seem to be running out of ideas for new Terminator models and rather than sticking to an original action plot, they seemed to have replaced an efficient killing machine for a good looking woman, probably for the benefit of many guys in the cinema, who it seems, this genre is more aimed at. Another problem I had with this film was the rating. The other 2 films had a higher rating which allowed for more to be done in the film. I think this one seemed a bit limited in terms of action scenes.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a pretty good film which I think works well in the franchise (not like the awful fourth film). I would recommend seeing this film, just don't expect it to be good as the first two."

","After nearly twelve years, a third installment was finally made. While certainly inferior, it had so many obstacles to overcome legally and financially that we're lucky we even got a film at all — and in the end; at least they did the best they could. Arnold looks like he hasn't aged a bit since ""T2"" and that alone must've been a lot of work. There's an obvious void with the absence of Cameron and Hamilton, and Nick Stahl is a poor recast of Furlong. The T-1000 is replaced with T-X (Loken), a female terminator that is dangerous and sexy, but she can't live up to Robert Patrick's nearly invincible villain. The story is well-written, with a decent attempt at explaining away any holes left in ""The Terminator"", but it fails to recognize important plot points from ""T2"". The self-awareness of the filmmakers knowing it's an inferior film makes ""T3"" an entertaining, fun and even humorous journey. The special effects live up to ""T2"" and the story's outcome is unpredictable. It's sometimes darker than the first two, sometimes lighter; at some points better, at other points inferior. Earl Boen (Dr. Silberman) is the only other actor, besides Schwarzenegger, to reprise a role.<br/><br/>*** (out of four)"
"Mr_Censored","7","1","1","17 December 2009"," Apparently There is Fate.
","When a sequel comes along 12 years after the fact, it is almost always met with cynicism and scrutiny. Never has the case been truer than with ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines."" The fact of the matter is that the two films before it redefined the science fiction genre in their own time, and the question loomed about whether or not a third film was warranted or even logical. Afterall, we saw the Connor clan in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" take down Skynet in its infancy stages, thus preventing Judgment Day, right? To quote the T-800's infamous gun-shop dialogue from the original ""Terminator"" film: ""Wrong.""<br/><br/>With original creator James Cameron completely out of the picture, director Jonathan Mostow takes the reins with Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to his titular role once more before settling in as the Governator of California. John Connor, the future leader of the resistance, is played by Nick Stahl this time around as we follow the character at age 22, with the world on the brink of the nuclear fall-out at the hands of Skynet. As before, a T-800 is sent back to ensure his survival, as well as that of his future wife (played by Claire Danes) while another, far more advanced female Terminator is sent back to ensure Connor is taken out of the picture and Judgment Day goes on as planned.<br/><br/>One thing the film is missing for certain is James Cameron's touch. To be fair, Mostow is a thoroughly competent action director, but there's a sense of ""been there, done that"" with most of the story that makes the proceedings rather stale. You could chalk that up to poor writing, but also because its predecessor leaves the story with nowhere to go. Until it reaches the end, ""Terminator 3"" just sort of meanders along, waiting to reach that moment where all is redeemed and John Connor finally is forced to accept his destiny. Having said that, though, there are some excellent action scenes to fill the time with therefore the film never gets boring or loses its pacing.<br/><br/>The film has been somewhat maligned for its humor, but it's important to note that it's not anymore of a comedy than ""Terminator 2"" was. Quite contrary, the bulk of the film is rather dark and brooding, and goes a long way in ensuring the correct mood and tone is established. There's also some key imagery in the film that makes it somewhat iconic. One scene early on during John's opening dialogue cuts to an ocean floor lined with human skulls and will send chills down your spine, as will the somber ending, which in the end, makes the film. Overall, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is definitely a worthy entry in the series, and in spite of its redundancy, manages to entertain as well as push forward the mythology of the franchise."

I thought that the comedic moments they put in were a little unnecessary to.

However, I truly enjoyed watching ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines."" This film does not try to fill up the entire story with useless action scenes. Instead, the action sequences are well done and fun to watch. Usually a sequel like this would lack good character development and would not focus on the people in the story enough. I felt there was significant development of the characters here, especially since this film takes place at least ten years after the events in the previous film. This film may seem a little more depressing than the previous two, but it is a lot of fun nonetheless. Schwartzeneggar plays his role just as good as he did many years ago, and I feel this is his swan song to Hollywood. This film has been needlessly criticized, when in reality, there is no reason to expect any more from it.

","SPOILER! Lots of big sci-fi flicks have come and gone since T2 so I had my doubts whether this was going to be any good or I'd feel the same but right from the start I got into it. I also had doubts about the female terminator but it wasn't too corny still the T1000 was more menacing. I figured out how they would kill the T-X when I saw the damaged energy cell explode in the desert and I never figure endings out. Speaking of the ending, I thought it was much better than the other two yet a little depressing. Ok so what didn't I like, I wish this were made a few years earlier, the whole feel was more ominous and we got to see some more future battles and more cool new machines (T-4 anyone?) 8/10"
"SecondOpinion","8","1","1","21 December 2003"," I wasn't disappointed at all
","I am a true Terminator series fan, and T2 in particular is one of my favorite movies of all time. So did I have incredibly high expectations for T3? Well, no.. First of all, Cameron wasn't directing, so that kind of lowered the expectations quite a bit. Secondly, I was even somewhat sceptic about the story they had come up with. How would they explain this  with regard to what happened in T2. Well, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The story made sense and whatever questions one might have had about SkyNet and why they keep sending terminators were answered satisfactorily. (Ok, so time travel movies always allow for alternative plots, but hey, it's Hollywood entertainment, not quantum physics) The special effects were top-notch, but then you wouldn't expect less from the sequel to T2, a true milestone in CGI. If anything, this movie was too short. It lacked the ""epic"" feel of T2. Arnold was good as he always is in the Terminator movies, the others were decent enough I guess. The movie was funny and I enjoyed the fact that Arnold doesn't take himself too seriously. Strangely enough, I noticed that most T2 fans were satisfied with T3 while ""ordinary"" people (non T2 geeks :-) tended to be more disappointed. I guess it has a lot to do with personal expectations. Well, personally, as a hardcore T2 fan, I enjoyed T3 and I certainly wasn't disappointed."
"pdrums","Null","1","1","4 December 2003"," A little too derivative
","I can't say I was disappointed, because I certainly enjoyed Terminator 3. HOWEVER, it was evident that this movie was unavoidably derivative of the first two Terminator movies.  Fantastic visual effects and a good story, but it certainly cannot top either of the other two Terminator movies for originality.  The problem was that nothing new or original was really introduced.  `She'll be back', both Terminators coming to Earth in a flash of nudity, all have been done before.  Kudos to Stan Winston and the people who did the visual effects for the movie, they are certainly among the best I've ever seen.  Just add something new, please."

"drunken_critic","9","1","1","21 November 2003"," Maybe part 4 will be better
","I came into this movie looking for a post apocalyptic fight against robots. I would have loved for the movie to open with Armageddon.   Nope, it was not like that.  It ended up being about the pre-apocalypse.   Once again Terminator robots are sent to the past to terminate John Conner and his future helpers.  In other words this movie is exactly like T2, but the only difference is they chase John 10-15 years later.  Instead of trying to kill his mom, they are trying to kill his future wife.<br/><br/>That is kind of disappointing.  I really would have loved to see John fight the robots in the future.  Well hopefully James Cameron will be brought on to direct T4, The final battle.<br/><br/>The movie itself was a great action picture.  The special effects were awesome.  Very memorable was the chase scene involving a crane, a motorcycle, police cars, ambulance, and a fire engine.<br/><br/>Question how did the female terminator control the vehicles during the chase scene?  A car's acceleration and braking is not computer controlled.  In the movie you see the gas pedal being pressed down by the terminator even though she is not in the car.<br/><br/>8.5/10 (I only gave a high review because of great special effects), but then again I am the drunken_critic."

","Movie legacies are a funny thing. Some work because of the structure of the subject matter, some work because of the profit opportunities. But only a few have been able to pull off lasting success. The one's that have not you can usually spot from the phrase `haven't they got anything better to do' upon release of the sixteenth film. The Terminator falls into that category, and although it as seemingly concluded, it's back for a third time. Money talks as they say. <br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in one of cinema's most illustrious characters, once again trying to save the world from certain destruction. Judgment Day, the rise of machines, was merely postponed, and now, ten years on, the machines will try again. This time, they have sent there most advanced creation, the T-X (Loken), sexy, sleek and highly affective, to destroy a now adult John Connor (Stahl), and his future wife, Katherine Brewster (Danes). However, the resistance was able to send a lone warrior back through time, the T-101 (Schwarzenegger) to ensure the survival of our young saviours. <br/><br/>For a decade, fans were well aware that the Terminator's `father', James Cameron, was not returning. Without him, T3 was never going to be easy. Nevertheless, T3 is, thankfully and surprisingly, damn good. Maintaining the intelligence, compassion, action and multi-layered premise of the first two genre-defining films was always going to be near impossible, but the filmmakers, to their credit, intelligently leave Cameron's oeuvre aside, opting instead for simplicity, which is where the films strength lies. They create a film that keeps the core and shape of the saga, and add enough human emotion, and self-discovery to keep the undertones of the trilogy pulsing, leaving enough room for $170 million worth of SFX, extraordinary chase sequences sci-fi babble, explosions and other action-packed hullabaloo. <br/><br/>That's not a bad thing mind you, far from it. The film is a class above your average action flick, and Mostow proves himself quite a deft hand when it comes to action, as well keeping the emotion and drama of the film integral to the film, which he does with trademark poise or flair. As Mostow excels, his cast are something of a mixed bag: on the plus side, Schwarzenegger is again superb, delivering a performance, which is both chilling and extremely tongue in cheek, and newcomer Loken is also impressive as the destructive yet alluring T-X, proving a great foil for Arnie in all departments, and adds a welcome dimension to the trilogy. One the negative side, however, are the young actors: Stahl is badly disjointed, his nice guy persona out of place in the aggressive and loutish role of Connor, and Claire Danes, though at times commendable, is restricted to a clichéd `damsel' role, running around screaming her lungs out and panting loudly.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, loud panting noises and nit-picking aside, T3 is really is a treat. Action-packed, funny, beautifully orchestrated, and made with an intelligence sorely lacking from the modern day blockbuster, it's the must see film of the year. And if you don't like it, I think you need your hard drive thoroughly virus checked. ****"

"mrkjcs23","9","1","1","12 November 2003"," best movie of the year!
","After 12 years, i was surprised that a 3rd Terminator movie was actually being made. The Terminator is the classic among action movies. Terminator 2:Judgment Day really stood the test of time to this day, and I believe that it surpassed the original, with a more in-depth storyline and characters, as well as a great performance by Robert Patrick as the liquid metal terminator. Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines takes the series to a whole new level. it has a lot more in common with T2 than #1. in my opinion, i think it was the most enjoyable of the 3. Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfectly natural at the role of the Terminator as always. Nick Stahl did a good job as John Connor. Claire Danes did a pretty good job introducing Kate Brewster. and it was good to see Earl Boen, who is the only actor besides Arnold to be in all 3 of the films, make an appearance once again as Dr. Silberman. but the one who really left a huge impression in my mind was Kristanna Loken as the T-X. i think her performance is amazing and her character outdoes that of the one from T2 played by Robert Patrick. she should at least get an Oscar nominee for that performance. she's an excellent actress, and i hope to see more of her soon. the movie also had some great action sequences, including the unforgettable one in the cemetery. it's definitely one of the best and most unique action sequences i've ever seen, and i've watched countless action movies, from the low-budget, video-only ones to the smash hits at the box office. i bought the DVD yesterday and it was very interesting to listen to the commentary by Schwarzenegger, Kristanna Loken, and the others. Terminator 3 was definitely a lot better than any other movie i've seen this year, and better than most i've seen in the past several years. it had a good ending that left hinting at another sequel. hopefully Arnold will be back for the main role if a 4th one is ever made, it just wouldn't be the same without him. also, it would be great if they brought back Kristanna Loken to play another female Terminator-she's perfect for the role."
"Enchorde","8","1","1","12 November 2003"," Really, much better than expected... bravo!
","**Here might be spoilers**<br/><br/>Must admit that I didn't expect much from this movie as I took my seat in the cinema. But I was surprised. This is one of very few sequels that I actually liked better than the movies which it followed.<br/><br/>Like the previous movies there are very elaborated action and fighting scenes were everything seems to be highly explosive. Well that was expected and the fighting scenes are pretty much what they were in t-2. However, I must say that they actually makes the mandatory car chase a great thrill because of the vehicles use, or specifically the one T-x uses (boy, I must get me one of those). <br/><br/>I agree that is clearly noticeable that it is not James Cameron that directed this movie. Instead of, or maybe I should put it, in addition to just being your ordinary action-thriller, this movie also sports a heave element of comedy. And this is what I think really elevates this movie above its predecessors. The comedy-bit is handled very-good so it really enhances the movie instead of destroying the suspense, however I would like to call it action-comedy because of that, it feels more accurate.<br/><br/>There are two things that annoys me though. First, why do people that are chased or in any situation were they are in short supply of time keep stopping up, just looking around and being a tourist, why? Second, Kristanna Loken as T-x seemed very much like a robot to me with constantly plain facial expressions. When I saw the movie I thought this was fine, however, when I read the trivia I learned that she had trained in communicating with facial expressions. Odd.<br/><br/>Well, I really liked this movie, and if you are looking for a action-comedy you will too... oh by the way, not surprisingly you'll enjoy this a lot more if you really know the other two... 8/10"
"teddeman","9","1","1","4 November 2003"," T3  The first action movie of the new millennium worth seeing.
","I was lucky enough to get a ticket to the Maryland premier of T3: Rise of the Machines'.  WOW!  This is the best action film since the first Matrix'. Maryland residents, SEE THIS AT THE SENATOR.  It will blow you away.<br/><br/>The film works on every level.  Good story, acting, action and just enough humor result in a film that lays the 2nd installment to waste.  I am personally glad that James Cameron passed on this project.  His access to unlimited resources will forever tarnish his filmic vision.  Cameron's version of T3 would have been as bloated and worthless as every movie David Selznick made after Gone With the Wind.'  Jonathan Mostow created a sequel that is true to the original and less than 2 hours long.  <br/><br/>
Yes, the budget was huge for T3, but it works and has the most plausible plot of the three films.  After accepting the existence of nearly indestructible terminators, everything else falls into place.  Controlled, limited CGI and muted special effects made every sequence believable (note to the Matrix 2 screenwriters  even though it was really cool, you will never, ever see two tractor trailers worth of Ducatis on the highway at the same time).  The action sequences were not to long (hello Matrix 2 writers). The resulting realism fuels total viewer immersion.  Suspension of disbelief was never pushed too far.  As a result, the audience reacts positively to what was happening on the screen.<br/><br/>Less CGI places a greater role on the actors and they did not disappoint. The characters related to each other in a believable manner.  There were no huge plausibility issues (John Conner doesn't send his dad back in time to impregnate his mother a.k.a. T1).  The writers developed a great inevitability of fate' angle to help the story along.  Sarah Conner reaches out from the grave to lend support and the annoying psychologist from the first film returns for a cameo.  The Terminatrix, who attacks with the tenacity and brutality of a woman scorned, is the perfect foe for Arnold. Arnold's one-liners are nicely spaced, a riot and help balance out the insane barrage of destruction the terminators leave in their wake. <br/><br/>
T3 also stands on it's own.  It needs no help from its predecessors (unlike Matrix 3'). The machines rise, as the title suggests, so if there is a T4, it will either be a prequel or take place in the post-human, Skynet world.  There is no need for a prequel as T3 provides a perfect conclusion to the `human-controlled' portion of the saga.  Don't expect a cheesy thumbs-up, into the smelter T2 ending.  The audience I was with applauded the movie as the credits rolled and I was right there clapping along side them.        <br/><br/>
Don't cheat yourself.  Find the movie theater near you with biggest screen (the Senator in Baltimore has a 40'one), best sound system (Lucasfilms certified the Senator's THX) and see this movie today!  You will not be disappointed."
"funkyfry","6","1","1","8 September 2003"," Terminator returns for more carnage
","This film surprised me by not being terrible -- I guess that's not saying much, but neither is this movie; it's just trying to blow a lot of stuff up and be a fun summer movie.  As far as that goes, it's a success. Considering how many of the basic ideas here were plumbed by the first film, there's also a surprising amount to think about here.  Fundamental problems exist, however: for one thing, there is so much carnage and destruction in the first 40 minutes of the movie that nothing which follows after can top it.  Loken is not particularly memorable in the way the 2 previous Terminators were, but Stahl and Daines are fine as the new Connors/lover combo.  Arnold is his usual self, spiced here with a bit more humor than usual.<br/><br/>Worth seeing, but only on an off night."
"BelgianJoris","9","1","1","14 August 2003"," The way SF-action should be (beware: spoilers!)
","I'm really glad Arnold Schwarzenegger needed money for his campaign :-) Just like in the other two Terminator movies, Schwarzenegger is casted perfectly as a killing machine from the future. Schwarzenegger's presence in an action movie is usually enough for me to like the movie, but for those of you who disagree, there's still plenty of reasons to go see this movie. From beginning to ending this movie is worth watching. The car chase scene is violent and destructive, the way we like it, same for the fight scenes. The writer is careful not to create any inconsistencies caused by the time travel, and references to the other movies and to a (possible?) future seem to be correct. Indeed, this is not just a 2 bit action film script, no, the story by itself makes this movie worth watching. There's some good jokes in the movie, some funny situations, a running gag with sunglasses and Arnold's way of handling oneliners. This all without interfering in other aspects of the movie, as is usually the case in action films. This is a must-see, but before you see this one, make sure you've seen Terminator I and II."
"boondocksaint20","9","1","1","6 August 2003"," A worthy sequel
","I was very apprehensive about this one for a while...but at the same time, excited.  The first two Terminators are pure works of art, in my opinion, flawless examples of filmmaking on almost every level (except for a couple of plot inconsistencies...like it matters though!).  James Cameron is a master of story telling, pacing, editing, characterization, and of course, special effects.  He is one of the best directors of our time....unfortunately he refused to film the newest installment of the Terminator series, though Jonathon Mostow did do a good job on T3.  At any rate, T1 and T2 were incredibly hard acts to follow, so T3 already had larger than life shoes to fill...and for the most part, it fills them quite nicely.<br/><br/>T3 literally dives head first right into the action after a short 3 minute or so prologue.  I will be honest, though the first hour has a lot of great stunts and hard core action, it just didn't do anything for me.  To me, it was all been there, done that from the get go, and felt rushed. Basically, the entire characterization part of the main characters that we loved in T2 was dealt with, in this movie, in about 10 minutes or less, and immediately dives into the same formula...killer robot goes on a rampage killing a ton of people for a reason that is not quite clear at the moment, but will unfold later.  Literally, there was no suspense, or buildup, just mindless explosion after explosion.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good action film, but with T3, one has to expect more...more substance, more story, more grasping the struggle for humanity...<br/><br/>Don't worry, I'm about to go on the great aspects of the film, and there are quite a few to mention...<br/><br/>All of my negativity ceased immediately when the second act began.  This movie totally blew me away during it's last hour.  The plot is finally explained and the story continues, with the central theme being that the ideals that 'There is no fate but what we make' can now all be thrown out the window.  Judgement day is inevitable, along with the destinies of future resistance leaders John Connor and his bride to be, Claire Danes.  All I will say is that when they take the fight to Skynet is when I was totally hooked until the very end.  As for the ending, I was very impressed.  A truly appropriate ending that will make you think long after you've left the theater.  I thought the ending was exactly what it should have been. Bring on T4!!<br/><br/>But, at any rate, T3, though pales in comparison to T2, which was obvious that it would even before it came out, it is a worthy addition to the Terminator saga.  Though, it does fail in several areas...for instance, there is almost no charisma between this new Terminator and John Connor, and very little plot time is given to the developing relationship between Connor and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes).  This aspect alone is my biggest complaint with the movie.  T1 and T2 showed how humanity can survive even in its darkest hour, and in T2, there is an irony that the only fatherly love that John Connor ever felt was from a machine.  Unfortunately, this theme was not carried on into this installment...the three main characters simply fight to survive and that's about it.  Given the circumstances though, it does seem realistic, but that is the fault of the filmmakers because they made the film so short...the true fans didn't want to see a compressed 105 min or so film loaded to the brim with action...we also wanted to see more drama, more character development, more everything that T2 had besides the explosions. Don't get me wrong, the new story is great, the acting is very good, and the action is superb...it's just there was that extra dose of the preservation of humanity that was missing.  Also, my next biggest complaint is the lack of a good, hard core, blood pumping soundtrack.  Where the hell was it?!? What we get is pure crap, or as for the first car chase scene, practically DEAD SILENCE for about 10 minutes.  Remember the cool tracks played when Arnie was on his motor cycle, or when he was fighting the swat team in T2? Man, I was simply aching for a musical score that would somehow TRY to compliment the mood of excitement...instead T3's score manages to surprisingly dull the excitement instead of adding to it.  Thankfully, we do get to hear the famous Terminator theme song in all of it's glory, but unfortunately, it is during the end credits.  Though the movie is still very good, these two things in particular (or lack there of) are what majorly drag it down.  On another note, I thought Kristanna Loken as the TX was pretty good, though not NEARLY as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000, she still looked very cool and very sexy in her breakthrough role...it's just too bad the filmmakers didn't allot a larger running time to allow a better buildup that establishes her as someone we love to hate and fear to dread. So in other words, T3's major let downs are not from overdoing anything, but underdoing way too much.<br/><br/>Yeah, that sounds like I'm going back on my praise for T3, but I'm really not...I'm only pointing out frustrations from a true fan of the first two Terminators, just like the same thing Matrix fans can say about the Matrix Reloaded (but that is a much different story).  T3 was action packed, had an incredible story that continued the saga nicely, and also added it's own shocking elements, had great acting, good direction, and above all else, Arnie once again in his glorious prime.  Arnie fans will NOT be disapointed with T3...though that depends on how much you compare it to T2, which I myself have found myself doing writing this review.<br/><br/>Anyway, the sad thing is that now that Arnie is running for governor, I doubt he will be making an inevitable T4 which will most definitely take place in the future.  But, this is the installment that everyone is waiting for!  At any rate, I loved T3 overall...it was a surprising breath of fresh air during a summer full of high priced stink fests.  This is Arnie at his best, and will hopefully revitalize his career...though it is sad to think that this is probably the last time Arnie will ever be in this top form again.  Since this is the peak of his comeback, I hate to admit that his career is probably all downhill from here.  Then again, who wants to see a Terminator in a wheel chair?<br/><br/>I highly recommend T3.  Arnie truly did not disapoint in making a quality film, just try not to compare it too much to the other movies and you will enjoy it all the better.  I give it a strong 8.5/10 stars, and look forward to it coming out on dvd."
"killeragy","9","1","1","3 August 2003"," Think about it
","Well, so far I haven't read too many compliments about this film. (I did like it, that's for sure). All of you people have to realize that T2 was 12 years ago - the effects were new, and we hadn't seen this many sci-fi-action movies back then. You have to keep this in mind when you watch this film. Nowadays we're kind of overwhelmed by computer-generated effects, blood, sex, car chases, etc. This can be the reason why we haven't experienced the same ""breakthrough-feeling"" after watching T3. Think about it.<br/><br/>Note: we were also twelve years younger then (compare Star Wars episodes in this context).<br/><br/>Great movie, Schwarzenegger is simply the best. Rate: 9/10"
"cheggers","8","1","1","1 August 2003"," Arnie is still GOD.
","Me and a couple of friends went to watch this last night with pretty low expectations. As major fans of the first 2 movies (and all Arnie's late 80's - early 90's outings)we couldn't see how a 56 year old could convince as a killing machine, and with no James Cameron at the helm and a GIRL (?) as the main nemesis things were looking less than promising. However, I'm delighted to say that I obviously know less than nothing as this movie absolutely ruled. Nobody else could play the title role period. Arnies performance was fantastic, shifting from  brutal, urinal over the head violence to real laugh out loud comedy with some of the coolest one-liners in recent memory. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes did well in their roles and the director stepped up a gear with some awesome, realistic (ok not realistic, but not 100% CG ala Matrix Reloaded) action sequences. All in all a pretty near perfect summer action movie, roll on T4. Last word however is reserved for the T-X, not only was she well tasty, (damn that long curly hair, always gets in the way)but she gave a convincing performance and more than held her own next to Arnie. Roll on Kristanna Loken in Striptease 2 - Return of the Tease!"
"NickSavage","9","1","1","4 August 2003"," Great Film- All Things Considered.
","When I went to see Terminator 3, I was so afraid of what I might be in for. So many sequels in years past have really let me down.  But, in spite of James Cameron and Linda Hamilton's absence, and the fact that this was made over 10 years after T2, this film was not bad at all.  In fact, I enjoyed this over all other summer movies so far.<br/><br/>I thought the action and the effect scenes were great, as well as Arnold's third performance as the terminator.  And that ""Terminatrix"".  She was perfect.  She came as close as one could wish for in terms of a superior cyborg and was ALMOST as menacing as the T1000 from T2.  This movie also does a good job of staying on track with the original story.<br/><br/>I've heard comments about how the ""time travel stuff doesn't make sense because John Connor bla bla bla""...  Lets face it folks, when you try to work out all of the impossible scenarios with time travel movies like Back to the Future, Terminator, etc., you can find a million ""but what ifs"", so don't think that hard.  Lets remember, its fiction.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this to all Terminator fans, as well as fans of Sci-Fi or action movies for the summer.<br/><br/>This ones definitely going in my DVD collection upon release.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."
"Europe86","9","1","1","13 December 2003"," Future is closer than we think.
","I find ""T3:Rise of the Machines"" to be as good as ""T2:the Judgement Day"" and way better than the original ""Terminator"". It is a bit funny as well and I do like the end of it. Afterall, not every movie has to have a good ending, right? I admit, I didn't see it coming. But it has a few flaws. One of them is the dialogue. That could have been done better. There were few other visible mistakes throughout the movie. I think they should stick with Eddie Furlong as John Connor. He was better in his role than Nick Stahl. And I think, in the opening part of the movie where they show John Connor as the leader of the resistance, Nick Stahl's make-up is done rather poorly. It is a sci-fi movie, but it is more real than we realize. True, when the original movie was made 20 years ago, it was all sci-fi, but now... what happened at the end may not be far fetched as we would like to think. Considering how our techology has developed, how the nuclear programs and war fare have advanced.......and how the things stand right now in the world....the future could be closer than we think."

","When I first heard that Terminator 3 was on the way I had mixed feelings, I was worried that Arnie couldn't deliver a worthy follow up to the previous two Terminator films without James Cameron, I needn't have worried, Terminator 3 is fantastic. In my opininion its the second best of the series, second only to the original, and better than T2. I always felt that T2 was nowhere nearly as good as the original, but the amazing special effects blinded everyone to the fact. In T3 it is an absolute Joy to see Arnold back in his most famous role, he's absolutely fantastic in this film. He looks great too, he's obviously been back in the gym for this one. Director Jonathon Mostow does a great job filling Camerons shoes and the supporting cast are great, the actor playing John Connor is much more likeable than whiney Ed Norton, and Claire Danes gets better and better as the film progresses, but all in all this film belongs to Arnold, the only down point for me was the lack of the familiar Terminator music from the last two films, anyway welcome back Arnie, roll on T4."
"mentalcritic","4","1","1","29 July 2003"," Sinking as low in two hours as commercial television has in twenty-five years...
","Arnold, I am able to remember way back in your career when many saw you as just another idiotic hero who couldn't speak intelligible English, a poor man's Sylvester Stallone, some called you. But your films appealed to me as a child for their raw violence, macho bravado, and the fact that in a supposed democracy, even a man whose only outstanding attribute was his biceps could make it big.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, you seemed to forget something around the mid-1990s, namely that your primary audience was young men who loved nothing more than the thrill of seeing how hard you could hit an enemy, or how creatively you could come up with a smart remark after creatively dispatching him. Instead, you began pushing this choice-removing agenda and making your films as family-friendly or ham-fistedly political as possible. The 6th Day is a good example of this - I am one of the millions of people whose life could be substantially improved by the cloning of singular cells.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 has me asking how much further you are going to turn your back on the things that made you a star. Few of the things done in this film to protect John Connor or Kate Brewster make any sense, and even fewer manage to satisfy the audience. Do you honestly think that not killing a singular person in this film somehow erases the ultra-conservative's stigma that you've killed more on-screen bad guys than any other actor in Hollywood?<br/><br/>But to get away from knocking Arnold and his lack of respect for the audience mindest that made him one of the richest actors in Hollywood for a moment, he isn't the only one showing a profound lack of respect here. The screenwriters in this turkey quite obviously read half of the scripts for Terminators 1 and 2, then thought to themselves ""wheee, I can do that!"". Unfortunately, Confucious hit the nail on the head when he said that when you only read half of the sentence, you lose all the meaning. Terminators 1 and 2 were famous for pushing how far one could take violence in a film that is approved for teen viewing, but they also had a certain intelligence and moral to the story. Terminator 1 in particular showed us that even the most timid, seemingly useless person can rise to be a king (or rather queen) when given the right circumstances. Not because it is their destiny, or even because they are pushed in that direction, but because they have the good in them to make the right choice at the right time.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 ditches everything the other two films told us about how our lives are not dictated or set to a script. Instead, we are told that Judgement Day is inevitable, and that we will kill ourselves for our own feelings of insecurity, no matter what. That's strike number one against the script. The next fatal error is to tell us that Skynet was no physical system at all, but rather a sentient program that is capable of writing its own digital virii to manipulate enemies to its will. Can you hear the screenwriting committee say ""hey, we need to make this story more MODERN, more NOW""? Remember when Madonna said that about the theme for Advertise Another Day, and what happened after that? Sometimes ""modern"" and ""good"" are two seperate things, guys.<br/><br/>The third strike against Terminator 3 lies in the cinematography. Granted, it's a real challenge to be compared to James Cameron and the people he likes to work with in this department. After all, he is the only director who knows how to compose a scene on Super 35 negative that looks the same no matter what ratio you frame it in. But even directors who use Super 35 and quite apparently don't know how to do this, such as David Fincher, can make films that are more pleasant to look at than this. Doesn't anyone know yet that the thing that made Terminator 1 in particular shine was that sheer mayhem was going on in front of the camera (cars going through front walls for instance), but the camera stayed as still as an oak so that one could see exactly what was going on? Well, in Terminator 3, Jonathan Mostow resorts to the tactic of wobbling the camera to keep us confused as to what is going on during key action sequences. Put simply, this is not good enough.<br/><br/>I won't get into all the continuity issues between this and the other two films in there series, but I will get into one issue. When Terminator 2 wrapped (and Arnold still had a career), James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd called it the final chapter in the story. As in that's it, we won't be coming back to this again, we'd rather be CREATIVE. Well, fast forward ab out ten years, and Arnold's career is tanking because he has turned his back on what made him a star in the first place. So he goes to James Cameron and moans ""puh-lease writer another Terminator so I can keep making films"". Cameron told him where to go, but conveniently, Mostow stepped in and said ""yeah sure, we'll have a good time wiping our butts on the film that made you the big star you once were"".<br/><br/>In short, to the writers of this pungent turd, I say shame on you for dragging cinema even further down into the ""dumbest buy the mostest"" philosophy that the summer blockbuster has been driven by for the last ten years (and yet they say ticket sales are slumping... gee, wonder why). To Arnold, I have the following to say. You are a sell-out, a hypocrite, and you are washed-up. You might call that statement cruel, but hopefully someone will read it to you and you will realise why the same people who made your career sparkle in the 1980s are turning their back on you. Until at least that happens, there is no hope for the intelligent action film. If Terminator 3 proves nothing else, it certainly proves that.<br/><br/>On the plus side, however, it wasn't nearly as bad as the committee-butchered Alien 3 that made it into cinemas, but it does stand alongside it as an example of an unnecessary installment in a franchise being slung out to make a quick buck. Both of these films have received a very generous four out of ten from me."

","As a huge fan of the original movie (10/10) and a lesser fan of the sequel (8/10), I was reluctant at first to see T3, fearing that a lesser director than James Cameron might provide a disappointing sequel. I was, then, unexpectedly excited and thoroughly pleased that I changed my mind and decided to satisfy my curiosity about this further inevitable chapter in the saga of John Connor. The movie begins with action and special effects, and continues with action and SFX unrelentingly. It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. The concept of a female terminator worked well, adding sex appeal and the opportunity for some humour amongst the carnage. The original movie still reigns supreme for its originality, but this is a worthy descendant - 9/10."
"KBean5588","9","1","1","17 July 2003"," Awesome Action & Villian, Great Ending, Good Story
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, is in my opinion, very well done. It combines the most intense action sequences that I have ever seen along with some good characters and a pretty well thought out plot. The acting: Overall, I would have to say the acting was good. Nothing great, but good for an Action/Sci-Fi movie. Nick Stahl's performance was fine, nothing to over-criticize. His performance as the older, 20-something year old John Conner has made some fans of the series a little angry at how different his John Conner is compared to T2's Edward Furlong's. First of all, I think they are both good actors and I probably would have rather seen Edward Furlong reprise his role as John Conner in the third film, but Nick Stahl did good. I also tend to agree to some extent the characteristic differences between the two Conners, but the only explanation that I can give is that going through a life-changing experience like Furlong's bad-ass Conner did in T2, can change your personality throughout your life, especially when you know the world is in your hands. So maybe the new Director, who also did a awesome job to fill in for Cameron, wanted the new Conner to act the way he did. Claire Danes was very good in my opinion as Kate Brewster, her first action role. Some critics and fans panned her performance and her character because they said she was just the girl who `screamed at everything.' Well, maybe she did, but at least she brought some of the only emotion from all the actors in the film. Arnold is Arnold. He will never be able to get away from Terminator, no matter what film he is cast in. It will always be compared to Terminator. He is in excellent physical condition for his age (56?). Kristanna Loken was exceptionally villainous as the new T-X evil Terminator, and extremely hot. Many people don't realize how hard it can be to be kicked, punched, and hit over the head (even if it isn't hard) and not flinch. Her face stayed emotionless and calm, exactly how a terminator should act. A few times she smiled, but that only added to her evilness. Although her character isn't nearly as terrifying as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2, she definitely added some presence onscreen. The Story: Overall, the story was good. Some stuff evolved from the previous two films and some other things contradicted them. I would definitely have liked it to be a little longer. But I have to say that I liked the fact that Jonathan Mostow took a different approach than Cameron by going straight to the action, and staying there the entire time. That is much different than Cameron's Action, Drama, Action direction from T2. Mostow had massive shoes to fill, and he filled them quite well. I loved the action scenes, because even though a large amount of special effects were used, they weren't the main object in each scene, like in Attack of the Clones. Many people are calling the effects mediocre, and nothing compared to T2's groundbreaking, Oscar-winning effects. Well, he knew he wouldn't live up to the effects, because basically, there was no more ground to break in the Visual Effects world, so he decided to take a different approach to the action scenes. And it paid off, for me at least. There is one scene that is possibly one of the best action-chase scenes that I have ever seen in a movie. All I will say is that it involves a massive crane truck, a Toyota Tundra, a motorcycle, a fire truck, and many `undriven' police cars. Awesome scene, and one of the best parts of the movie. All in all, great movie and if you're a fan of action or Sci-fi, you'll like it. Just don't think too much of it like a die-hard Terminator fan, or else you'll get to confused. ***1/2/****"
"kcirevam","8","1","1","18 July 2003"," Better than I expected. *Some spoilers*
","Terminator 1. Great movie, scaringly believable plot... setting standards. Time is immutable. The only reason John Conner exists is because SkyNet tried to terminate his mother in the first place. The machines had no way of knowing that, so they tried anyway.<br/><br/>Terminator 2. Still a good movie, better action... plot with more holes than a slotted spoon. We change how things happened, so much so that by the end of the movie we are led to believe that the war never happens. In direct contrast to the standards laid out in the first movie.<br/><br/>Terminator 3. Better than both it's predesessors. Action ten times better than the first two combined. The plot? Some of you may have missed it hidden way in there behind all that action, but it was there. Not a whole lot of it I admit, but it was there.<br/><br/>*Spoilers here* So is time immutable? No. Is time an easy thing to change? No. What happened in T2 was such a huge event that it shook up the future enough to delay Judgement Day for years. We believe that the loop was broken after T2, but instead we find that the loop has simply changed. But now the war's started, now there's no turning back. The resistance will arise, John Conner will lead humanity towards victory... but not before sending the man he knows is his father back in time to his doom. Will it happen differently? Not at first. Not at second either, John will want to make sure it happens the same way. Only this time round, John knows he's going to be killed before the third Terminator is reprogrammed... he'll be ready. SkyNet doesn't know any different.<br/><br/>So what happens next? Simple, John wins the war against the machines, we already know this... and the shattered remains of humanity begin anew. But there's a difference. There are probably a many number of events that could unite all of humanity towards a common goal... and that would be one of them. In this new future... we stand united. We stand as one.<br/><br/>This story, is over."

","""What ever you want to see honey,"" is what I told my husband.  I had no clue that Cameron was not majorly involved in this movie.  I knew that Furlong was not going to be on the screen and hated that.  I whispered to hubby before the movie, you know if they do a T4, I don't care of Arnold is in next one.  That is how low my expectations were for this film.<br/><br/>I left the movie going WOW!!!  I loved the action.  Some action came so fast and so furious that this non computerized brain could not process what it had just seen.  Alot of action was hard hitting.<br/><br/>One reviewer stated Dane's character was not very credable especially when she locked up John Conner and did not go running for help.   I would like to think that this character had some backbone and was a strong person, knowing that she knew him, felt that there was no need to panic, yet.  And in the long run that is who she needed to be.<br/><br/>Other reviews I have read say there is no story line.  I saw that TX (the latest model of terminator) was intent on its mission  (ITS - non gender its not human)  Like a machine with specific tasks TX took the straightest possible route from point A and point B.<br/><br/>One person commented on how they did not like that TX said ""I like your gun"" while other Terminator models made same comments on objects they were about to take.  I assumed that this was the film makers way of telling us how the TX was going remove the cop from its path.<br/><br/>As for Furlong not being in the movie, by the end of the movie I felt that the new actor represented John Conner the adult, the scared face warrior of the future.<br/><br/>I loved seeing the Dr from T2.  I thought it was a nice sentimental touch. (Maybe Cameron-esque)<br/><br/>Lastly,  The T100 unit (Arnold) was not portrayed as compassionate (for those who have not seen T2 on DVD - there is footage that shows changes made to the terminator allowing him to learn gain a bit of humanity)  This was not the same machine from the previous movies and I liked the reinforcement of that fact.<br/><br/>While this movie may have disappointed some, I found it completed a circle between the three films and if this is the last of the Terminator movies I think it was well done.<br/><br/>And as Dennis Miller use to say... Thats my opinion.. I could be wrong."

The second time I saw it, I took my nine year old nephew.  He also loved it!<br/><br/>It has plenty of action yet still a solid story line.  Nick Stahl and Clare Danes were spectacular.  You could really 'feel' for their characters.  I wanted to give ""John Connor"" a hug!

This movie, like the previous Terminators is made so that I sit back and enjoy the movie and forget all the reality stuff.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 also leaves plenty of room for a T4.

"WilsonLau","9","1","1","8 July 2003"," Rise of Arnold...From the ashes of Collateral Damage...etc
","The Terminator movie machine has risen and it has taken the lives of inferior sequels everywhere! As we celebrate the return of Arnold to a role that defined action roles in the last 3 decades(80's 90's 2k)we also celebrate the successful return of the Terminator franchise as it come bursting out into the limelight once again. I believe the success of this movie not only rests on the $170 m. budget, the solid acting, well choreographed action sequeces but it is also the fact that the promoters, the advertisers and the brains behind this movie did not make the mistake of over hyping it. Too many movies have come before it, kicking and screaming before they hit the screen, raising expectations to impossible heights and then letting everyone down in an unbelieveable way.<br/><br/>There wasn't much the T3 team let anyone in on, other than the villan was female and 2 acters weren't returning. Which leads me to my subject. Arnold. He's been lacking these few years, lets not kid ourselves. End of days was no Arnold movie, the 6th day was kinda watered down and so was Eraser. Jingle all the Way and Batman&Robin were jokes. So this is a very crucial movie for Arnold in this particular junction in his career. Hopefully he keeps riding off the waves of success created by this film and becomes more selective about the roles he accepts.<br/><br/>T3 is all Arnold. Unquestionably the Arnold of old. We don't just see glimpses here and there like in his recent watered down roles. This is truely, purely, classic Arnold at his best. I am talking about Arnold in his coronation days for Conan, Predator, T2, Commando etc. Arnold Reprises his role well, looks good in terms of physical conditioning, and spits out great one-liners left and right. Speaking of his physique, it is astonishing but really not that surprising for a 55 year old to look that good, because he is after all a multi-time winner of the Mr. Universe contest.<br/><br/>
So Arnold's huge, the movie is solid, the action is mind blowing, go see it! Don't let others stop you. You owe it to yourself and the last 2 previous movies to see this movie. In my opinion it is the best movie of the summer of 2003. 8 out of 10. Bring on T4."

","It's been many years since Arnold Schwarzenegger last donned the trademark leather jacket in T2 and with James Cameron not involved there was reason for trepidation but the franchise is back in fine form under director Jonathan Mostow (""U-571""). Another Arnie robot is sent back in time once more to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl, wisely replacing Eddie Furlong in the part) and his potential love interest (Claire Danes in her first action part). Coming back to try to kill them is the T-X (model babe Kristianna Loken). This film features some great action sequences that blow away anything done in the overhyped ""Matrix"" sequel and it's good to see Arnold back in fine form in the role he was meant to play. The ""message"" of the film seems to be ""you can't escape your destiny"" and it attempts to answer the questions posed in the previous films about wether or not you can truely change the future by traveling back in time. The performances are good from the cast, the direction is solid and the stunt work outstanding.  I do have a couple of quibbles with the ending, but I can't really get into that without giving away key plot points.. so I'll leave it at this.. this film is a heckof a good time and certainly better than a few of the other over hyped films that we have seen lately.

I love that this movie doesn't take itself too seriously.  This one definitely has the most humor and the action is on par with the other films.

"CMUltra","8","1","1","5 July 2003"," Whew! That was a relief.
","I was apprehensive going in. Terminator is one of my favorite franchises and sequels always run the risk of turning out *really* bad.  Added to the general ""sequel worry"" was the fact that Cameron was no longer at the helm. I had no idea who Jonathan Mostow nor Kristanna Loken were.  Both blew me away.<br/><br/>If you like action movies, SEE THIS!  There is a chase scene early on that alone makes the movie worth the price of admission.  And the action rarely lets up.<br/><br/>With Mostow driving, this Terminator is different from T1 and T2.  It is assumed that we know the story line by now so most of the time is given to action and, surprisingly, a good amount of humor.  Most of the humor is in-jokes reflecting events in the first two.<br/><br/>Loken was great!  It's so easy to go wrong with a character like the T-X, but she carried it off great.  Facial expressions and body language were both excellent.<br/><br/>Stahl was fine in the role of John Connor.  It wasn't a strength of the movie but the portrayal really didn't hurt it either.<br/><br/>Danes was a weak point for me.  The Brewster character looked a bit old to have been a junior high make-out partner with Connor.  Brewster also seemed confused as to what type of character she was.  One moment she grabs guns and mows down opponents, the next she runs about screaming.<br/><br/>The requisite ""die you bitch!"" line near the end is getting old too.  Sgt. Ripley saying it in Aliens was cool and on target.  Thereafter it's just a poor rehash.<br/><br/>Arnold was, of course, Arnold.  This is a role made for him and he carried it with the same style as in the first two.  Better really, now that his character has been infused with some humor.  Arnold *is* this franchise. Make no mistake, even with the humor, these are terminators.  They are deadly, and prove it.<br/><br/>Overall, fantastic!  I went in prepared for the series to go down a notch but hoping it was at least entertaining.  It turned out to be better than T1 and only slightly inferior to the legendary T2.<br/><br/>7.5 of 10."

"FreedByFiction","10","1","1","7 July 2003"," This proves there is indeed no fate for the Terminator series.
","When I heard there was to be a Terminator 3, I was kind of excited. Then I heard that James Cameron was not affiliated in any way with the production, and with no Linda Hamilton to boot, and my expectations were pillaged. The trailers (at least the second one) were impressive, but the film was still destined, or had a ""fate"", if you will, for disappointment. On the contrary, the film's fate was not disappointment, but surprise. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is a truly worthy entry in the series. It has a great story, good new characters, and fantastic acting. Nick Stahl, though not resembling Edward Furlong from the second one (but looking a lot like Michael Biehn from T1), is fine as the new John Connor. Claire Danes is also good as a very sudden, yet very important and potent new character. And Arnold is, well, back as Arnold. But thats a good thing. Kristanna Loken is the T-X, a new breed of Terminator, who can shape shift, liquify, and sprout projectile weapons, all in the disguise of a blonde beauty. Needless to say, this element of the story is quite scary. She's actually scarier and nastier than the T-1000. Who would have thought? The movie's written by the guys who wrote David Fincher's ""The Game"" in 1997, a wonderful movie. This gave the production some hope. The film is very, very action packed. Almost relentless. And while it has its dramatic moments, it doesn't compare at all the the emotional impact of ""T2"". But that's fine, being from different people. The fact is, this is a true Terminator movie, and you can call the series a trilogy without a splinter. It binds the story and characters together again. And that's what we really wanted, not James Cameron's name in the credits. 10/10"
"MovieMusings","Null","1","1","7 July 2003"," subtle genius
","The response to this film would be warmer had it not been for the monumentally substantial act of Terminator 2 (hereinafter referred to as T2) that it had to follow. The campy fun of The Terminator (T1) was absent in T2, which took a dramatically dark tone. It was longer, more philosophical, probed many intellectual themes and generally changed the way action films are done, by offering more than just shoot-em-up and car chases.<br/><br/>Anyway, I LOVED T3. It brought back a little of the campy fun of T1 while offering a stingingly direct approach to some issues that were dealt with in a more indirect artful way in T2.<br/><br/>WARNING - THERE WILL BE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW - SEE the film and then come back for the rest of this review.<br/><br/>By the end of T2, we really thought that ""it was over,"" that they had taken action to change the future. <br/><br/>Here in T3, the T-800 tells an incredulous John Connor ""it can't be stopped, it is inevitable."" We, the audience, join John in not believing, and hope they are able to stop SkyNet's assumption of control... at the end of the film, the screenplay really is genius, as we join John and Kate Brewster in the numbing realization that, indeed, no matter what they do, judgment day cannot be averted.<br/><br/>It's really a funny slap in the face for us sitting in our seats watching this film. Although time travel is currently understood to be at least inaccessible to us at this time, (if not altogether impossible), we all missed something very simply - way back in T1, we saw that the world had been overrun by the machines, and they were losing to the resistance, so they sent a terminator back to kill the mother of the leader. Clearly, judgment day had happened, and the resistance did form, fight, and turn the tide. So, everything in T2 still couldn't avert judgment day...we already knew in T1 that, somehow, despite Sarah Connor's efforts with help from the T-800, the resistance would still have to fight in a post-apocalyptic period to overcome the HKs and T-800 infantry...yet we still wanted to believe the ""real story"" was about averting it.<br/><br/>Now we're seeing that the ""real story"" will take us beyond judgment day, to the brink of the end of humanity, when a resistance force will be lead by Neo...oops...John Connor (yes, we all see the similarity in themes between these two films...!)<br/><br/>In T3, Arnold's acting in the character of the T-800 is really amazing. He tells John (and the audience in so doing) that he is NOT the same ""personality"" as the T-800 in T2, that they roll off the assembly line (setting up a T4 with MULTIPLE ARNOLDS!!!!)...this T-800 did show some ""memory"" (zero casualties, keys in sun visor), but that's only because the chip was somehow either retrieved or a copy was not destroyed when they blew up Cyberdine, I missed it specifically).<br/><br/>Whatever, this T-800 must relate to John differently than it did in T1 or T2...and Arnold did bring across a sense of distance, very abruptly offsetting the intimacy shared between John and ""his terminator"" in T2 -- far from a bad acting job, this is sheer acting brilliance, in my opinion!!<br/><br/>When Cameron did T1, he may not have realized the franchise he'd stumbled into...T2 was so much more than just a sequel, so much more than just an action movie...and also not the shortest film ever made.<br/><br/>
T3 was quite short, and ends with a cliff-hanging ""stay tuned"" not seen since Star Wars, Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back - it's OBVIOUS this installment was just a necessary bridge towards the next installment, beyond judgment day. I suspect Cameron may get back into T4...but even if he doesn't, Mastow did well in trying to carry this franchise forward with a nod to its heritage (like bringing back Earl Boen's Dr. Silberman character - the way that scene was shot shows clearly Mastow knew his audience, I joined the folks in the theatre laughing at merely the recognition of his voice, before his face was finally shown on camera - perfect!)<br/><br/>BRING ON T4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

The movie expands on the history of the series and manages to answer that question of ""if we destroyed SkyNet, how is there a third movie?"" quite well. Arnold does another excellent job of portraying the stony and unemotional T-800, and Kristanna Loken does an amazing job as the new Evil Treminatrix.  Of course the fact that she is a beautiful blonds in a sexy outfit does not hurt the movie either. All in all, this is the first good movie of 2003.  I went in expecting a good action movie with maybe a little depth too it and T:3 delivered in Spades.

The car chase after the vet's was better than The Matrix Reloaded's, which was overrated. Arnold did a surprisingly good job at his 3rd time being the Terminator, many of his lines are humorous without being corny. The T-X was pretty cool but the T-1000 would own her any day of the week except on Mondays because that's the day that he gets the nerve endings in his face disabled because that man has THE coldest face I've ever seen. The few scenes of the missiles launching & landing at the end were also very cool &, to me, gave the movie a better sense of being a reality. I highly recommend this movie, it is truly worthy of the Teminator name.<br/><br/>Note: You have to see the 1st two movies before you see this one or else you'll get very confused."

","All in all, I liked this follow-up to the other two Terminator films. I do admit that I would have liked to see the original John and the a return of Sarah Connor, but I have to say that this new cast has got something new and fresh to add to the series. I don't understand this mess about not understanding the plot or the plot  does not have the Jim Cameron surprise flare to it. What?!? How can people say this was not surprising?!? Obviously some of the negative critics were not big fans of the other two movies. The plot was just continuing the story with a nice little twist at the end ( I smell a T-4....hmmm...) When leaving the theater,I wasn't sure I liked it much but now, after thinking about all of the different elements brought to the film, I see that T-3 was quite good (It will never be as large as the other two but very very very close in my mind...). I would give it an 8 out of 10. It was exciting, intense, non-stop action. The dialogue gets a little confusing and Ah-nold still doesn't ennunciate his words but I thought the story was really great. Any fan of The Terminator films will like this one. I do recommend it but MAKE SURE YOU SEE THE OTHERS BEFORE YOU SEE THIS ONE! Oh yeah, for those that do not like all the action packed things, there is a lot of classic humor and a small love story that play into the film. The ending is also sad and tear jerking....umm...yeah :-/ ....go and enjoy the film!"

","Is this film as good as T1 and T2?  No.  Is this film a decent addition to the family?  Absolutley!<br/><br/>Since this was just released, I'm going to do my best to write a review without giving much of the plot away.<br/><br/>On the surface, there's not much new here from T2.  Arnold is back to defend John Connor from a shape-shifting terminator.  This one's tougher and sexier than Rober Patrick, but that has nothing to do with this positive review... :)<br/><br/>First and foremost, I liked how they continued the story.  After T2, I wasn't sure how they could extend the existing plotline while remaining believable.  I love the set-up for Connor, the new mission for both terminators, the twists along the way, and the revelation at the end.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I was impressed with what Nick Stahl did with the part of Connor.  He had some pretty cliche lines to deliver from time to time, but his portrayal made me care about him.<br/><br/>Jonathon Mostow has a great eye for action sequences, and has done an admirable job at the very unenviable task of following up a James Cameron classic."

","I must admit, I was a bit concerned when I strolled into the theatre to see the latest edition to the terminator saga. But only for a minute.  The special effects are some of the best yet, and if I'm not mistaken, didn't the previous two set the bar for their time as well? This was an all around fun movie, with as much destruction and stoic one liners as can be crammed into a two hour movie. Whoever missed James Cameron in this film was also to busy reminiscing to perceive how good this movie really is.<br/><br/>Granted, T-X was no-where near as sinister as the T-1000, but you were kept wondering up until the last 5 minutes of the movie how they were going to get rid of her. Now, the ending is exactly what I would hope for. A complete twist, slightly predictable, but exactly as I would like it to be. I will say no more for those who haven't seen it yet. I predict that the nay-sayers will keep a few from seeing this movie at first, but once it gets out how great this movie is, it may be one of the biggest action movies ever."

"MitchHellman","8","1","1","6 July 2003"," Thankfully NOT a blockbuster movie (some spoilers)
","Compared to some of the other movies released this summer (such as Matrix Reloaded and The Hulk) the hype machine was not running full-bore for T3, in my opinion. As a result, I found myself more able to appreciate the movie's strengths without much in the way of pre-conceived notions getting in the way.<br/><br/>Rather than a total deconstruction of T3, I'd rather just mention what I liked about it:<br/><br/>1. First and foremost-- the ending. I was worried that T3 would continue with the plot point established in the first two Terminator movies: that the Terminator was sent through time to prevent the awful future from taking place. Not only was this done to death in the others in the series, but was the whole point behind the Back to the Future trilogy (only the result in that series was much more clever). It was a welcome change to see this dealt with in a different way, one that echoes some of the essential pessimism of T2.<br/><br/>2. While in general I agree with other comments in this forum that the portrayal of the T-X lacked some of the feeling of menace of Robert Patrick's performance in T2, Kristanna Loken managed to capture and reproduce many of Patrick's mannerisms: the sideways tilt of the head, the eyes looking upward while the head was lowered, etc. It gave me the impression that they both were programmed with the same instruction set.<br/><br/>3. With the exception of the pneumatic breast scene (which was basically there for laughs), the T-X did NOT infiltrate and further her goals by means of sexuality-- a departure from most SF movies featuring superhuman females.<br/><br/>4. Though there was a different director and Linda Hamilton did not appear, I felt that there was a strong effort made to keep the story consistent with the rest of the Terminator mythos. For example: the tank-like machines that were activated by the Terminatrix also appeared in one or more of the Terminator video games that have been made over the years since T2. I appreciate this attention to detail.<br/><br/>All in all, I got my money's worth. It was entertaining but was (blessedly) not a huge, overblown megablockbuster movie. <br/><br/>Loud, though."
"Deckard-16","9","1","1","6 July 2003"," WOW! By far the best sequel to a sequel ever!
","I almost feel guilty for liking this movie so much. Who'd have thought that T3 without James Cameron's involvement could be anything slightly better than average? But T3 is not only a 10 on the ""summer escapist movie"" scale it is also a 9 on any other scale unless your idea of a great movie is Moulin Rouge or The Hours. Johnathan Mostow has taken the reins from Cameron for a Mach2 gallop. This movie is funny, lighter and as muscular as ever despite its much shorter length. An early chase scene is better than anything ever seen on the big screen (sorry French Connection and Reloaded) and although it is the high point of the movie T3 maintains the steam built up by it-- which I found astonishing. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are very welcome additions to the T-mythos. Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor is almost not missed here (her fate is nicely handled) and Edward Furlong's John Connor is not missed at all. Arnold is in fine and, sometimes finer, form. Kristanna Loken doesn't have the acting chops of Robert Patrick, but her TX is an advancement over his T1000. Give everybody credit. The tech credits are as good, if not better, than the last 2 Ts. The real surprise is the story and the writing. On close analysis T3 may seem like a rehash or mismash of the T1&2 and it may not make any logical sense. So what? Count the calories in your next pizza and beer combo. Be a buzzkill. All I know is that I cared about the characters and what was happening to them. I was caught up in the story. T3 is as much fun as you'll ever have at movie."
"NotSureifthisis7734","9","1","1","6 July 2003"," T3 may be unnecessary, but it works.
","This film avoids all the mistakes of the Matrix: Reloaded.  It's brisk,<br/><br/>the action purposeful, humorous when it needs to be, smart and<br/><br/>well-written.  There is also none of the Matrix oddness (e.g. when<br/><br/>John Connor makes a rousing speech, it isn't followed by the<br/><br/>Terminator doing some weird dance number). But what really swayed me over to the movie's side, was the<br/><br/>wonderfully downbeat ending.  It took guts to do this and everyone<br/><br/>involved in the film's making should be applauded for their<br/><br/>courage.  The late Gene Siskel said that one of the biggest<br/><br/>problems with contemporary American movies were the endings: <br/><br/>writers and directors no longer knew how to end them.  This movie<br/><br/>ends right.  Well done."
"jwpon","8","1","1","6 July 2003"," The story was only okay, but the action was great, and a terrific plot twist at the conclusion
","If you're looking for a really deep story, with great character development, there are probably better movies than T3.  But for non-stop action that leaves you riveted to your seat, and interesting twists in the story of John Connor, I think T3 delivers the goods.  After reading so many strongly negative reviews, I went to T3 with lowered expectations, and received quite a pleasant surprise.  I think Nick Stahl did a credible job as John Connor - I found myself having no problem accepting him as the young adult incarnation of the future savior of humanity.  Arnold, although 12 years older, is still THE Terminator (although I felt a few of the gags, such as the star-framed glasses, were silly and inappropriate).  And I think Kristanna Loken was good as the T-X; attractive as she was, I think she was sufficiently terrifying.  While the movie doesn't develop the characters, it didn't prevent me from sympathizing with and rooting for the good guys.  The action scenes were excellent - the first chase sequence was one of the best I've ever seen.  And the ending came as quite a surprise.  A thoroughly enjoyable movie.  Whether this was the end of the Terminator saga, or if there's a T4, I think the movie was a worthy successor to T1 and T2, definitely worth the money, as well as the 12 year wait.  8 out of 10 stars."
"bill_b4","9","1","1","6 July 2003"," Definitely A Must See
","SPOILERS: Saw the movie and have to say that it was a very pleasant surprise. Not only was it faithful to the concept of the first two movies, but like T2, builds on its foundation and brings new ideas. I particularly liked the concept of fate...John Conner, knowing his fate, yet denying it; the inevitable takeover by Skynet, etc. It also managed to bring in new and exciting action and special effects, as well as building onto the plot and surprising me by taking it in unexpected directions. All these factors make the movie very entertaining, and worth the price, especially for Terminator/Schwarzeneggar fans. <br/><br/>Another tidbit that I've been pondering since seeing the movie, is the evolutionary psychology behind all 3 films. The first one came out during the cold war, in which the Soviet Union and the United States were in the middle of a Mexican standoff with a combined nuclear arsenal capable of wiping out human civilization hundreds of times over. The first movie was created within those times, and the message was one in which the human spirit can prevail, in spite of the potential armageddon, and can seek to change a probable future. The second movie, created at the end of the cold war in which detente and diplomacy had achieved a bloodless end to the potential nuclear confrontation that had been hanging over the world for the past two generations, had a different message: one in which man is in complete control of his destiny, and if he is willing to take the risks and make the sacrifices, anything is possible. Now we come to the 3rd movie, and the current world is much different. No longer do we face a potential standoff between nuclear states, but the specter of international terrorists, and the possibility of a nuclear, chemical or biological attack by these ruthless groups, especially in a post 9-11 world, I think has brought back the fear of armageddon again, albeit from a different direction, and I believe this last installment of the Terminator series, reflects that fear. We fear something catastrophic is around the corner, something terrible and unavoidable feels bound to happen, and it is now just a matter of time, so prepare for it. The enemy is not within a single mainframe at one specific location, it is all around us, and unable to be removed. I believe that is the underlying pervasive psychology behind this movie, and as an honest reflection of the times, brings another element of pleasant surprise, and another reason to not miss this movie."
"danthemovieman","9","1","1","5 July 2003"," He's ""back""
","Arnold Schwarzeneggar's back and couldn't be better in ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"". In this 3rd edition of ""The Terminator"", Arnold, the good cyborg, is sent back again to protect the future savior of humanity John Conner (Nick Stahl) from a female terminator who is much more advanced than Arnold (and yes, the liquid metal stuff is back) In this movie, it starts out differently. John Conner tells us of what we've missed of his life for the past few years. He's the same guy, still messed up. He has no one, just himself, and he works odd jobs and never gets settled down in one place, he is on the run constantly. Also in this movie, it's not Arnold who arrives to the present first, its the Terminatrix, the female terminator, who arrives first in the present day. She does not know who she has to kill yet, but she has a few possible suspects, and she starts to go on a rampage, killing two innocent people, before discovering who her target is.   People won't be amazed by the special effects, we've seen them before (""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"") and they haven't really changed. However, this is the most destruction in a movie I have ever seen, Lots of explosians, and a good movie debut by Kristanna Loken, who plays the female terminator. Lots of humor, explosians, destruction, good acting, and nice direction make this movie into the perfect summer sequel that should be a box office smash!         <br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"
"bcorse","9","1","1","4 July 2003"," The best action movie this year!
","Like many others, my family and I went to this movie expecting to be disappointed.  Instead, we were pleasantly surprised at what turned out to be an excellent story wrapped in some of the most intense action scenes ever filmed.  And yes, Arnold is Back. The ""professional"" reviews have been all over the map on this one, so two words of caution: (1) ignore any review that mentions Arnold's political leanings or ambitions, since they have nothing to do with this film; and (2) dismiss any comment about this being a ""failed franchise"", cause it ain't so! The worst thing that the current creative team could have done was try to out-do or copy T-2:Judgement Day, so they didn't.  Instead they focused on John Connor, now grown up but incredibly paranoid because he doesn't really believe that the future of the world is secure.  Turns out he's right. This is not a James Cameron movie, and in hindsight that's a good thing. This film is completely faithful to what's gone before, but takes us in a new direction which forces John Connor (and us) to finally come to terms with his destiny.  The cast here is excellent:  Claire Danes is exceptional in a role that could have been a drag on the story in less capable hands. And Kristina Lokken as the T-X deserves way more credit that she's getting from some reviewers: I thought she played the role just right, as a cold, heartless killing machine.  The fact that she's an attractive female seems to blind some guys to the fact that there have been very few modern films that show its female leads as anything but conflicted, hapless victim.  Like Robert Patrick in ""T-2"" and Arnold himself, this Terminator is ruthless, deadly and totally dedicated to her mission.  The film's climax wisely harkens back to the first film by stripping away the T-X's outer ""skin"" and revealing the mechanical monster underneath.  This girl is pure evil, just like she's supposed to be. The ending itself is completely unexpected, but quite good.  I won't give it away here, but you'll find out that the story isn't really over yet."

","(I will try to write this review without giving away any of the plot, which is particularly difficult because the story was very original).<br/><br/>Finally, a hollywood movie that didn't show everything in the trailers. This movie looked borderline for me.. but I am a loyal Sci-Fi Guy so I had to see it, and I wasn't disappointed.  The trailers for this film were uniamiously bad, just your typical action/Arnold-with-a-rocketlauncher, unoriginal shoot-em-up.  What this film ended up being was a delight in acting (notably Nick Stahl as John Connor) and Claire Danes(when is she bad), story, and cinematography.<br/><br/>The story really moved along, although it was the typical: chase John, John escapes, Re-acquire John, chase John, John escapes.  The movie felt complete in a way in which the previous installments never really did.  I left the movie satisfied, but not in the typical Hollywood fuzzy way, but in a deeper meaningful understanding way... I would like to think I'm not reading too much into ithis film but everyone I was with totally agreed.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to any Sci-fi/Action movie fans.. and maybe even some Drama lovers who just want a touch more adventure."
"samuelmiller","9","1","1","2 July 2003"," Better action than Matrix, but loss of T story...
","A few have already said this, but I'll say it again anyway... It would have been  better with James Cameron.  The acting was not up to par, and the overall aura  of the film lacked from the feel of T1 & T2. I'll say now that I did like it very much, but not nearly as much as the first two.<br/><br/> There are some things that just don't make sense, but there were those in the  first 2 as well.  Whenever you deal with time travel you are going to have some  holes in the plot.  I wasn't bothered by ""when or why"" the Terminators were sent  back.  I was bothered, however, by John Conner talking to Arnold and  seemingly unaware that it was not the same Arnold from T2.  I mean, doesn't he  remember the Arnold from T2 was destroyed? Conner was there and saw him die, I would have thought it'd make an impact. The new Conner just seems dumb.  This brings me to say that Stahl is no Furlong--maybe for the better in  real life, but not in the movie.<br/><br/> The action scenes were indeed amazing.  I saw Matrix 2 last week, and unfortunately had to sit through near 20 minutes of men jumping all over cars  and trucks on the freeway.  The chase scene in T3 is short and sweet and originally well done. There is some humor in the film, which is nice. The acting, as I said earlier,  could have been better--especially when compared to the first two with Linda Hamilton.  It was a shame she wasn't in this one.  I assume they just couldn't get  her to do it.<br/><br/> The female terminator was okay.  And I have no problem with Claire Danes, aside from the fact that the more new people in the film, the less like ""Terminator"" it feels.<br/><br/> I won't spoil anything here, but if you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean:   There is certainly space for a T4, and it certainly could be great--but only if  Cameron have more say in this film.  Otherwise, it should be under a different  name.<br/><br/> I'll sum it up by saying that T3 is a great action flick, but it lacks the sci-fi feel of  like the other 2 (especially the first, did).  However, it would have been nice to  end the series at T2, or get Cameron and the original cast to make a movie more similar to the first two.  It's turning more into a ridiculous action film--don't  get me wrong, good action--but lacking story..."

"ragekorne","8","1","1","2 July 2003"," AMAZING!!!!!!
","Lets just say like any self-respecting man I am an extreme fan of the terminator films.  From the moment I saw Arnold knock on a door and ask ""Sarah Connor?"" followed by smashing through it and absolutely going to town on her with a gun to make sure the woman died, I knew I had found that edgy sci-fi gold.  The Terminator had it all.  Action, cat and mouse games, sci-fi, originality, humor, and above all the ability to make you believe in what you were seeing.  Then guess what, a few years later a sequal came and blew it away.  Terminator 2 still stands as one of my favorite films of all time.  It had everything the first had and then some.  Emotion, state of the art special effects (which are now the mainstream), and more.  I can still watch that movie over and over.  It not only stands the test of time, it created the term ""Better than the first!!""  Now, years later a third terminator film is being released.  Believe me, if you're a terminator fan you should be excited as hell.  Not worried.  I was able to check out the film last night, and before it began I thought to myself, ""If there's one thing I hope they don't mess up, please let it be the FEEL of the other two movies.""  Jonathan Mostow, I applaud you.  I was a fan of your work before but I am extremely grateful you kept this franchise together.  I love the way you worked in everything.  This is as good a sequal as any and it fits in perfectly with the first two.  The acting is top-notch, Kristinna Loken stands out as the baddy.  Ah-nuld is back in full form, and the rest of the cast is simply amazing as well.  Also, this is by far the funniest film of the trilogy.  This movie has it all.  The best car chase EVER!!! (yes, it blows away the matrix reloaded), the best fight scenes in a long time (I'm sick of every movie, unless it's the matrix franchise, having bullet-time effects and gravity defying kicks), the best story of the three films. It's all here and it's all amazing.  I couldn't find one thing I disliked. It's an awesome achievement.  It's a fitting sequal.  It's a fun ride.  It's a thought provoker.  It's a Classic."

","I've been a lukewarm fan of the terminator series.  I watched the two previous films before seeing T3, and it really struck me that these films are more about hardcore action then a believable plot.  Not so with this film.  They brought back much of the writing talent from the first Terminator and it definitely shows.  People may complain about the lack of blood in this film, but I think it adds a sense of reality and suspense that it would not have otherwise.  There are plenty of explosions and action for the less intelligent, but for once these have been put second to good science fiction.  I've seen many films that have not managed this mix well. This film pokes fun at its occasional cheesiness so that we know the writers are sure where it's going.  This film has a surprise ending which alone is worth the price of admission."

","Arnold defintely returns, not only to the Terminator series, but to good action movies, from a slump of a few years. When I first saw the trailers for this movie I thought it looked like it was going to bomb, and be terrible, especially without Cameron directing it, and Hamilton not returning as Sarah Connor.  Then I started hearing good things about it closer to its release, so decided to go see it on it's premiere night. I was amazed, Mostow had pulled it off, a very excellent Terminator movie the lived up to its name.  It didn't have as much as a ""dark"" feel to it as much as the first two, but it did have everything else.  The action, the explosions, and Arnie.  A couple of scenes did feel like they were remakes from T2, but other than that it was pretty original. The hand-to-hand fighting scenes between the good and bad terminators were off the hook. It was also nice to see some of the machines from the ""future wars"" to appear in modern day.  Some of them didn't look too different from some of the spy planes that the US military are using today, which was kind of creepy. The ending was defintely the icing on the cake, throwing me for a loop, I never expected it to end the way it did.  This movie is better than Matrix Reloaded, and quite possibly the best summer action movie of 2003."

","Dude, this movie lives up to the Terminator heritage. In every regard, it ups the ante on classic themes and sequences from the last 2 movies. Even without Cameron, the movie has the same end-of-the-world urgency that made the other two better than the sum of their explosions. The same time-travel/ apocalypse ideas remain well intact and properly advanced. The new chick Terminator is highly evolved from the last with several new tricks and gizmos, and Arnold is completely vintage in his deadpan ass-whoopin'.  From an action junkie perspective, there are quite a few parts that max out on damage and gunfire. There's plenty of scenes not even hinted at in the trailer, so you will be intrigued by some of the various developments and moments throughout the film. Finally, a true summer blockbuster worth the time and money.  9 of 10."
"mp3_dd","9","1","1","2 July 2003"," Arnold Delivers!
","Wow, just got back from Arnold's new flick, or perhaps it's not only Arnold's: wonderful to see him finally again sharing the screen with other actors. The film truly delivered, it was action packed, yet, unlike the matrix, the action was remarkably realistic (as realistic as you can go with robots from the future). Arnie was in his old form: fewer lines, more punching, and yes he was funny... Almost all of his one-liners worked with the crowed, and yap, a number of times the theater burst out laughing. The plot was strong, and while it wasn't adventurous by having too many side plots, it delivered, and stayed strong through out the movie.<br/><br/>Performances were excellent: John Connor (Nick Stahl) was strong and convincing, Arnie was Arnie , and TX (Kristanna Loken) was hot yet managed to stay scary... The only major actor who I was not really positive about was Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) they tried to replace John's mom with a new face, but I think they should have dropped that personality from the story...<br/><br/>Special FX were well done, but not over done... They left off from the old T2, and managed to have the same combination of CGI effects and real effect (i.e. explosions) in a very convincing fashion, quiet amazing... However, while T2's effects were groundbreaking, T3's were just plain excellent...<br/><br/>Finally the ending sequence and the twist, were unexpected and positive, and in my honest opinion left the crowed very happy.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't as smooth as T2, and probably could best be compared to ease of transition to The Transporter and Bourn Identity, the best recent action films I could think of.<br/><br/>Overall the film was a surprise, I expected eye candy, and I certainly got it, but the strong preferences and compelling plot elevated it to the top action film in recent memory. So anyone who can enjoy an action film should see this one!<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","I saw ""Terminator 3"" tonight at a sneak preview.  I thought that it was a solid entry in the series.  I do believe that ""T2"" is the best installment in the series then i would say T3 then the first Terminator.  Alot of people will disagree with me on how I rate the movies in that order.  Terminator 3 did not have as much drama as the first two but it still had its fair share. The action sequences were great and the story was well told. Arnold gives a great performance as the terminator.  The T-X was on the same level as the T-1000 as the villan.  T3 was a solid entry the series and a must see for Terminator fans and action fans.  Also i say it was better than the Matrix Reloaded."
"Vermillion","9","1","1","1 July 2003"," Best Film of the Summer
","This movie is by far the best film released since the ""Summer"" began. It doesn't get as heady as The Matrix Reloaded, and its action has a more purposeful feel, rather than the destruction-for-destruction's sake of The Hulk.<br/><br/>The actors suit their roles perfectly. Arnold hasn't aged a bit since T2, and the T-X is a refreshing change from the T-1000. John Conner is well played by Nick Stahl and Claire Danes as Kate Brewster does a very decent job in her part.<br/><br/>My only complaint in the James Cameron v. Johnathan Mostow debate being that Mostow seemed to opt for a few too many slow-mo shots for dramatic effect. Other than that minor issue, I really think Mostow did a fine job of following Cameron's T2. There is a good amount of ""tasteful"" humor, too.<br/><br/>As for the story, the formula is much the same as T2 -- for the most part. Our Terminator is dispatched to stop the T-X who was programmed to kill John Conner and his commanders. There are enough plot twists to keep you interested without delving into melodrama. The whole plot is just believable enough (all things considered) to entertain.<br/><br/>My main complaint is that the musical score for T3 uses nothing of Brad Fiedel's awesome score for the previous films. There is a redux of the ""Terminator"" theme nearer to the end, but I feel the lack of Fiedel's cold, mechanical themes detracted from an otherwise perfect action film. The movie has many great throwbacks and references to the prior films so the omission of such great themes was a pretty big disappointment for me. Overall a great action film, and the best yet for this Summer."

","I loved this movie. Yes James Cameron is a much, much better director but, the script was really good. It's sad that James didn't direct it because it was worthy of his attention. This movie has action, laughs, surprise twists and great acting! Arnold has gone the extra yard for a touchdown. Christana Loken was fantastic and a much better terminator than the villain-terminator in T2. Claire Danes gave a wonderful performance and the guy who played the John Conner character left us feeling just the way we should about John Conner. The F/X were really good and there were creative twists. But forget the 'splosions and think about what's being said. These movies are warning about technology out of control. Surprise ending was really good. Over-all: very high quality science fiction that can be appreciated on many levels."

I used to think that T-2 was amazing and that nothing could be better but then i watched it again the other night and realized that i just got caught up in the hype when i was younger and now that you see it T-2 isn't all that great. Overall T-3 has a excellent script, great acting by all involved, and the ending was excellent, it made sense, and it was like a punch in the gut.   I wasn't expecting too much from this movie and i came away with far more than i ever expected. I liked how a little more humor was<br/><br/>incorporated into this one seeing as how we are dealing with such a heavy<br/><br/>subject like the end of mankind and I thought the visuals were excellent. the only negative i have is that some of the car chases were a bit excessive but<br/><br/>other than that this is a more than fitting installment into this great science fiction series. 10/10"

","The first thing one wonders about T3 is whether Arnie can still give the same performance he did in the previous two movies? If you watch this film, worrying about that, then you will eventually not be disappointed since Arnie's performance is top notch and is easily on par with the previous two. Problem is that the other characters in the movie were'nt giving it the same effort he was. Nick Stahl was completely inappropriate as John connor and comes across as a complete and utter loser incapable of doing anything while his pairing up with claire danes is nothing short of hilarious.

"mkm-hermanjnr","4","3","6","11 November 2019"," The kiss of death that started the franchise's demise
","Terminator 1 was a great sci-fi horror flick with some action thrown in. The T-800 was a menacing, unstoppable blunt force killer and Schwarzenegger was perfect for the role.<br/><br/>Then we had Michael Biehn, an underrated actor, delivering a memorable performance as Kyle Reese, and Sarah Connor played iconically by Linda Hamilton.<br/><br/>Terminator 2, for me, was the absolute apex of the series. We had the central cast back again and Edward Furlong put in a good performance as young John Connor. Somehow Michael Edwards' 20 second appearance as Future John Connor was the absolute best in the whole series too, selling the fearsome image of the man John was going to become simply by robotically surveying the battlefield with his scarred and grimly set face.<br/><br/>And who can forget Robert Patrick as the T-1000? He doesn't breathe when he runs, he never blinks, and even when trying to be ""friendly"" there is something completely insidious about him. The absolute best antagonist in the Terminator franchise.<br/><br/>T2 had themes. Responsible versus irresponsible use of science, whether AI can truly be human, determinism versus fate. It also offered a lot of commentary on how humans are naturally stupid and self destructive (""It is in your nature to destroy yourselves."")<br/><br/>Then T3 came along. Oh dear.<br/><br/>Not only did all of the central core cast of the previous movies, sans Arnie, completely disappear but the film immediately misunderstands what made the previous films great.<br/><br/>The Terminator movies were never about huge explosions or massive action set pieces. Those things happened of course, but they weren't the central attraction of the films. What made them so good was the motif of humans working together to prevent a horrific future brought about by human hubris, greed and arms racing.<br/><br/>T3 by contrast is all explosions, throwaway misplaced comedy and no brain.<br/><br/>The TX is basically ""The T-1000 but more better-er"" because it can smuggle big guns in it's arms.<br/><br/>Yet it's not better. It's nowhere near as scary as the T-1000 because it acts really stupidly, barely even bothering to disguise itself. The one time it puts on a disguise, it randomly removes it in broad daylight right in front of it's victim for no reason, allowing them to escape.<br/><br/>The T-1000 never needed big plasma guns because it was stealthy and frighteningly intelligent. It understood that people trust police officers and so it disguised as one. It socially manipulated people and abused the authority it's disguise gave it. It never revealed itself in the open unless it was sure it could get away with it.<br/><br/>The T-1000 could be your mother, it could be your father, it might even just be disguising itself as the floor under your chair until it has the opportunity to silently stab you to death. And it would do so efficiently and emotionlessly. Terrifying.<br/><br/>The T-X by contrast seems to have bizarre emotions, weird quirky habits (shoving blood soaked rags in it's mouth?) and it's first transformation isn't played for horror, but for laughs as it enlarges it's boobies. Really?<br/><br/>Nick Stahl as Connor is rather miscast, he is a whiny washout who spends most of the movie ineffectually being useless or whinging (an annoying pattern every movie since seems to have jumped on, totally neutering Connor).<br/><br/>But perhaps the worst crime the movie commits is in clumsily making Judgement Day ""inevitable"". The film offers no sensible logic for why this is, but the message is clear: Fate is fate, don't even bother to change things. Why even get up in the morning?<br/><br/>Wow, what a stupid message!<br/><br/>Terminator 2 was a very dark film, but it ends on an uplifting note when Sarah comments that ""If a Terminator can learn the value of human life, perhaps we can too."" The whole theme of T1 and 2 was that by acting sensibly, compassionately and using science responsibly, humans can make a bright future for themselves rather than a terrible one.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the message of T3 is ""Just do whatever you want, it's all pre-determined and there's no point to anything."" and yet at the same time ""We must fight robots for some reason.""<br/><br/>T3 established the same tired pattern in all subsequent Terminator movies; increasingly silly twists, rampant CGI, over the top new ""better"" Terminators that lack all the subtlety and menace of the original T-1000 and weak casting.<br/><br/>I for one hope they just let the ""franchise"" die now, in my mind nothing after T2 is canon, simple as."
"bowmanblue","8","3","6","26 June 2016"," No matter what you say... it's still better than Part IV
","One of the main problems with 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' was that it had to follow not only the original 'Terminator' movie, but its (arguably better) sequel, 'T2: judgement Day,' therefore whatever came next had not just one, but TWO tough acts to follow. In short – it didn't.<br/><br/>It does its best to follow the plot of the first two movies, i.e. bad cyborg sent back through time by the machine-rulers of the future to kill humanity's last hope for survival versus protector (also from the future), however, it comes across as a Terminator-made-for-TV movie. If it wasn't for the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as the titular cyborg, it has a real sense of being a lot less epic than its predecessors.<br/><br/>For a start, it's shorter, secondly, the effects don't seem to have improved much since the groundbreaking 'liquid metal' SFX from T2 and it never really makes us care much about the characters. Linda Hamilton did not want to reprise her role as the iconic action heroine Sarah Connor, leaving Claire Danes to do her best to fill her shoes. And, if you've been following Edward Furlong's 'career' since he made his name as the young John Connor from T2, you'll know that he wasn't in much shape to reprise his role. Instead, Nick Stahl tries his best to play humanity's future leader and, although credit for making him look like his (on screen) father, Kyle Reece, is never really given much to do apart from look confused at the fact that the Terminator has returned. In other words... T1/2 produced real characters who stuck with us through the ages whereas T3 rushes us from one chase scene to the next and it's over before you know it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong – I didn't hate Part III. I own it and watch it every few years (just not as much as the first two, obviously!). It has its good parts – mainly Schwarzenegger. He still holds his own, even playing – technically – a new cyborg from the last two instalments. It's also worth noting that Part 3 is a '12' certificate, therefore don't expect the overall dark tone from the other two. There are more wisecracks here which lighten the mood.<br/><br/>But, even if you do hate it, it's still pretty good fun watching two indestructible cyborgs go toe to toe and the ending is actually quite good. Perhaps the worst thing about it was that it's great ending leads us effortlessly into Part IV (aka Salvation) and we all know how that one turned out (sorry Christian Bale, but a Terminator is not a Terminator movie without Mr Schwarzenegger taking the lead role)."

","Question: Can a sequel get much worse than T3?....

And, this time around, Arnold's performance (that featured some of the lamest one-liners imaginable) was a total embarrassment on all counts.<br/><br/>After being paid a ridiculous $30 million to star in this ""Save-The-Future"" clunker, I seriously think that Arnold should be absolutely ashamed of himself for delivering such a crappy portrayal of a T-101 bimbo.<br/><br/>With T3's story simply going over the same, old, tired ground, again and again, the viewer would have to be a totally clueless nitwit not to see that this idiotic, action yarn was going nowhere, fast.<br/><br/>Anyways - I thought that Nick Stahl made for an utterly pathetic and completely despicable ""Saviour"" as John Connor.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","5","3","6","3 December 2008"," Fall of the Series
","After two excellent films(if anyone is contesting that, hey, I'll hear you out, just be sure to bring impeccable points against them... or it can of course be a matter of taste, which there's no accounting for, and I have no beef with anyone who uses that as a reason to not care for them) we get... this. No, really, *this*. What is it? Does it even know, itself? It's certainly not a Terminator film. Do I even need to explain that one? Take a look at pretty much any moment of it and compare to, yes, any of the earlier two. Go ahead. I'll wait. In the meantime, let's go over what else this could be: A parody of the others? Yes, that really could be it. Was the self-irony in T2 not the exact right amount and tone? Did anyone want what this had in that area? Even if you do laugh at the initial sunglasses bit, you're likely to, a second or so later, go ""wait a minute..."", and that's not the last of it. Add to that, there is a Road Runner gag in this. You think I'm kidding? Check for yourself, around half an hour in. The ""humor"" largely consists of stupid stereotypes, trying to get cheap laughs. No... in truth, I know what this is. A popcorn flick. And it shouldn't be. Like its predecessors, it's got action, and it's big. Unfortunately, now you can also add ""dumb"" and ""loud"" to that description, and that does not belong in the universe of these. You want that type of cinema experience? Heck, go for it. I do, too. But that is not what this franchise is. The shoot-outs and car-chases are simply not that exciting, and every time this tries to recreate or mimic something in one of the previous entries, it's awful at worst, and dull, never reaching the height of them, at best. The script is daft. It holds a handful of interesting concepts or ideas, however, none are terribly utilized or followed through. More noticeable are the times that the writing is convenient. And somehow, after a kind of light, easy to take in running time, this ends in a depressing(not to mention abrupt, unsatisfying and pointless) way(sadly, Boen's role in this can be described that way, as well). I agree with what Hamilton said when she declined this. You can tell James Cameron had no direct hand in this. I will say that the effects are mostly well-done, though a few are hideous. The character of Kate was annoying and unnecessary. John manages to have a higher pitched voice than he did as a 13-year-old(!) at times in this. The acting varies, it's not all bad. The leads do convincingly(fingers ought to be pointed at the screenplay, instead). They didn't particularly think of anything new for the the cyborg. And before anyone asks if I could come up with such, hey, maybe not, meanwhile, you do not see me going out and making a sequel to T1 and 2. Kristanna did give this an effort, and clearly got into it, and the fault does not lie with her. The T-X is instantly and infinitely obvious in why that was their choice. Did they have to stoop to that level? There are at least three separate occurrences that were put there for no other purpose than to attract male teenagers, and could be taken out with no loss to the rest of it(the key-words give clues). Thus this is the first of these to have aspects that are gratuitous. The sexuality, the nudity, the language, the violence, heck, the whole bloody thing. Apart from cashing in, why was this released? The DVD has some specials, including a marvelous documentary, outtakes(fairly low on the list of hilarity-to-length ratio, if you ask me), featurettes(one with Todd MacFarlane, who is a blast to listen to and view), a commentary track(they're informative enough) with only Mostow, and one where he's joined by Arnie, Stahl, Danes and Loken(although they're recorded separately, so there is little to no back-and-forth). For that last one, I'd go with the Director's Cut of Judgment Day's, instead: The track for that is an interesting case... it contains almost thirty(!) people, and while that obviously seems quite bombastic, it's handled well. There is a main speaker, and it would appear that everyone else who says anything has done so in interviews, and the parts that fit with specific stuff(shots, sounds, effects) are then put in here, briefly introduced(occasionally after they've already spoken) by the... producer or who it was. I'd give that a listen if you care for such. Back to what there is on the discs of this...They range in quality, but I'd say that the one that stands out, to me, anyway, the sole thing that even begins to justify the existence of this, is the Sgt. Candy Scene. I'd watch that even if you have no other contact with this. I recommend this to those not attached in any way to the prior movies that share a title with this, and/or people looking for something to turn their brain off to. I don't have a problem with entertainment pieces of that sort come to be, nor that they sell(again, I am one of the buyers), I merely object to using this established name for that. 5/10"

And for some reason these negative online nerds some how make people scared of movies or make them say what they want them to say. ""Yea it sucked"" stuff like that. Most of the people that bash T3 contridict themselves time again and again.<br/><br/>People whine about how it was too much like T2, then the next sentence they said it was not like Cameron's T2 at all. People are just mad because T3 did not have Cameron.<br/><br/>FACT: JAMES CAMERON LOVED THE MOVIE!<br/><br/>In July in a BBC interview he said he loved the movie and thought what Mostow did was true to his series and well worthy of his saga.<br/><br/>And James has more of a reason to hate it then anyone even more then the most die hard fan.<br/><br/>And we all know James is not one for BSing he tells things like it is, he is powerful enough to do that.<br/><br/>The movie was made for fan/general audiance. The General movie goer, even the big nerd ones will watch it see and action movie that was good but lacking detail. A true Terminator fan will see all these small details here and there even with in the action, that besides the age mistakes on Sarah and John really fit in to the Terminator saga. Everything that was done in T3 if you look very closley it was said in T1 and T2. Some say how can T3 be, well most fans know that T2 ended with a paradox. If John was still alive, the Terminators/Skynet must still exist due to the fact that Skynet made the Time Displacement Equipment and he sent back Terminator's, then the resistance stole the Time machine and sent Kyle back to protect Sarah from the Terminator then he concived John. So if there are no Terminator's there is no John, some people just don't get that.<br/><br/>Story: Not as detailed as the others, but it has more meaning then some see, and really follows what was talked about in T2 and T1, including how Cyberdyne would become part of the military. In T2 the Terminator said ""In three years Skynet will become a huge military supplier."" Well everyone knows T2 takes place in 1995, and 3 years would of been after Judgement Day, so the Terminator always knew that JD would never happen until 2007, or when ever T3 takes place. Very good story. Too bad that the execs took out about 50 minutes of story/character develoment, we will see that in the T3 Ultimate Edition DVD.<br/><br/>Visual Effects: Easily the best this year. Yea maybe it does not have as much as Reloaded or LOTR but it has smaller scales, and more realism. Some things people would never guess were CGI until you told them. Including all...thats right ALL even the close up one T-800 endo's in the future scens are all CGI.<br/><br/>Sound: Will blow you away. The music was much more human/mechanical instead of Fidel's techno that gets boring. Marco did a wonderful job. And the sound effects in the whole movie will blow you out of the water.<br/><br/>Acting: Well done, Stahl was the best in this and the Terminator did a great job as being the T from T1 and T2 combined. Most don't understand that Mostow was trying to de-construct the father figure the Terminator had on John by making him more machine like so that in the future he could fight them more. Kristanna did a great job as a villan. Bravo to all.<br/><br/>Editing: Though great I will complain as a huge fan we know there was 50 minutes including a long end fight and 10 minute future war sequence cut out. And a lot of the story scenes left on the floor. I bet if all the scenes were left in T3 would of been hailed as much as T2 by everyone.<br/><br/>Bottom Line. T3 was superb, doing what the fans wanted it to do. Making a good ending and not just some yipiee the good guys save the day again ending. A ending that left you quiet and in awe. Making you wonder if we will do something like that some day. T3 was art, it was not verbaly a detailed movie like T1 and T2, it had the detail in between the lines. And if you can filter out the great action, you can see this story and how deep it is.

"zkonedog","4","3","7","3 March 2017"," Lacks The Gravitas Of The Previous Films
","There are many problems with ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"". Despite those problems, however, it manages to remain an okay flick. It's just disappointing, considering it could have been oh so much more.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""T3"" sees a future in which Judgment Day has not yet happened because of the successful events of T2. John Connor (Nick Stahl) is a vagrant, moving from place to place in search of relief for his nightmares about a potential apocalypse. In 2004, a female Terminator (Kristanna Loken) comes hunting for John and a number of people who become his future associates. So does Judgment Day still happen? That will be up to John, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), and the classic Terminator model (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to figure out.<br/><br/>The good thing I have to say about this film is that it uses the Skynet plot line that probably should have been used in T2 (I never liked the Cyberdyne angle of that film). For the first time in this series, viewers get to see what Skynet would have been like in its initial stages, and that was pretty cool.<br/><br/>The big and obviously problem, however, is that ""T3"" lacks the gravitas that the other films before it so easily possessed. This was probably due to James Cameron removing himself from the director's chair. This feels too much like a ""tacked on"" film that was kind of making things up as it went along. They stumbled upon an interesting Skynet plot, but other than that it is kind of a mess. Too many explosions and gun battles, as that isn't what this series is really about.<br/><br/>Truth be told, I can only give this movie three stars because I like the sci-fi and time-travel aspects of the franchise. Basically, I want it to be better than it really is. It is more of a 2.5 or maybe even 2-star effort. Sad, as such a better story could have been told."
"Screen_Blitz","5","3","7","26 November 2015"," Inferior continuation to the Terminator saga lacks excitement
","In this second sequel set ten years after the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day when John Connor and his mother Sarah Connor seemingly stopped the occurrence of the war between war between mankind and Skynet, John Connor (played by Nick Stahl) is 19 years old and is living as the drifter with no place to live, paranoid about being found by another terminator. However, Skynet sends T-X (played by Kristanna Loken), a powerful and sinister android who's bent on killing Connor. Aided by his future wife Kate Brewster (played by Claire Danes) and CSM-101 (played by Arnold Schwartznegger), another terminator resembling T-800, John Connor must find Kate Brewster's father General Robert Brewster (played by David Andrews) who is capable of shutting down Skynet as it spreads a deadly virus across the globe that would lead to nuclear war and ignite the war between humans and the machines. Racing against the clock, will John Connor succeed and save the future of mankind, or does mankind have a dark future ahead of them?<br/><br/>The first two films were quite impressive, the first film dealt with the Terminator traveling back in time to assassinate Sarah Connor and her then-unborn son John Connor to prevent the war, and the second film followed the next terminator traveling back in time to protect John Connor from being killed by T-1000 as he was supposed to be the future resistance leader in the war against the machines. This film, directed by Jonathan Mostow, continues the story of the franchise, while this demonstrating some pulse-pounding action sequences and a compelling premise, it sadly falls short of the excitement that made the first two films entertaining. This movie continues the story on a rather middling note. From the first ten minutes, we are introduced to the evil robot T-X driving around town and executing these targeted civilians who serve no relevance to the plot. Then we are introduced to CSM-101 who arrives at a strip bar to steal the clothes and car keys of a bouncer, similar to what we saw in Terminator 2 with T-800. There is also the intense, but exciting special effects-heavy car chase scene with CSM-101, similar to the motorcycle chase with John Connor and T-1000. These two scenes, while full of excitement, play a great homage to the events of the last films to where it almost feels it is repeating the same events from the previous movie. From there on, the plot becomes less and less interesting, the action becomes less compelling, and the characters seem a bit tiresome. The main thing the characters are lacking is good dialogue and writing. Thus, they end up becoming less memorable. While the actions manages to keep the film standing, this film itself suffers in many places, especially the ending which I found rather anticlimactic, even though it sets the tone for the next film.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines did not live up to my expectations and fell inferior to the last two films, especially the second one which I consider the best of the franchise. I believe this could have been better if it was handled by James Cameron who was responsible of the last two movies."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","3","7","4 September 2015"," The beginning of the decline of the Terminator films, but not as bad as reputed and better than the succeeding two films
","The first Terminator is among the best of its genre, and Terminator 2 is bigger, richer and every bit as fantastic a film, one of the few sequels to be as great as its predecessor (Aliens, Godfather Part 2 and the Toy Story sequels are also noteworthy in this regard). Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is certainly better than the two films following it and it is not that bad a film, but it is nowhere near as good as the first two.<br/><br/>It is a bit unbalanced, with some misplaced and clumsily written comic relief that really does jars and there's far too much of it, and while the story is cohesive at least it is too more of the same, with in the first half not having anywhere near enough of the suspense and dark atmosphere (pretty predictable in fact), and some of the monologues ramble on too much, a few almost endless.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a visually well-made film with a nice atmosphere with an appropriate darkness to it, it is slickly shot and edited and the special effects while not as stunning as the ones in Terminator 2 are solidly constructed. Jonathan Mostow is no James Cameron, but he does direct competently. There is a pulsating music score that has the right amount of energy and mysterious atmosphere while being too obvious, and while the script is uneven and not expansive enough with the characterisation it at least doesn't sound stilted and doesn't become so stupid that you're bashing your head repeatedly on a wall. Terminator's one liners are as wry as ever.<br/><br/>Regarding the action, it is still thrilling and expensive in look with some high-octane chases and well-choreographed action. While the first half drags and is not very well-written, the story really picks up and becomes more diverting with much more of the dark atmosphere as seen before. The cast are good, with Arnold Schwarzenegger coming off best in the title role, imposing, badness and sometimes amusing, while Kristanna Loken is surprisingly and suitably y poised. Claire Danes does a good job with a not so interesting character, and while Nick Stahl underwhelms sometimes , being a little stiff and dull to start with, he is a decent fit and improves dramatically as the film gets better.<br/><br/>All in all, not that bad but vastly inferior in quality to the first two films. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"hanzo0313","9","3","7","7 May 2007"," Some thoughts about T3
","I think the director of T3 just gave up doing one thing that other series movie director want to do. That is, ""N+1 should be better than n"". Yes, T2 is fantastic, outstanding, classic of all time, or simply-invincible. Trying to make more effects, explosions will not make any good, so why not ignore T2 and tell a whole new story for upcoming T4, T5? If you consider T3 as a introductory to the real judgement day, T3 has many clues and foreshadowing which can be developed for John Connor.<br/><br/>But I still can not imagine how John lead the mankind to fight back. With some home-make bombs? And in T3, Skynet only has some prototype of T1 in 2003, that's a little bit too weak. Remember, T-800 are supposed to conquer the Earth in early 21st! <br/><br/>Maybe John did see 2 terminators and know how they were terminated, but that's far far away from fighting back by a resistance leader who only know how to make dynamics!"

"RussianPantyHog","1","3","7","28 March 2004"," Bloody Awful!
","In 1984 I lied about my age and sneaked into a cinema to watch Terminator. Wow! What a movie. In 1992 I saw T2 and was just as thrilled. They are both fantastic, so I was really looking forward to this. What a let down :( It's hard to find ""spoilers"", because there's no plot, though a lot of (gaping) plot holes. This film cost a fortune to make but it's SO bad it actually feels like a TV movie. Lots of explosions, but not much else. My biggest complaint is that it all moves far too quickly. There's no 'depth' to any of the characters and they all look as if they'd rather be doing something else. On the good side (thinking hard) Clair Danes is a very talented actress, though struggling with naff material. Arnold does look incredible for his age & it's staggering to think he was 55/56 during filming, but he sounds 'weary' and has none of the menace of the earlier films. As for Nick Stahl. Sorry Nick; you couldn't act to save your life. One particular line from big Arnie sums up this rotten movie for me: ""My CPU is working but I have no control over my other functions."" I honestly expected him to pee his trousers at that point. I'm glad to see most other folks thought T3 was awful and I won't even be bothering to see T4 when it inevitably comes along. It was sad to see Arnold Schwarzenegger end his movie career on such a low note."

"benmandudeman","10","3","7","5 December 2003"," The terminator
","This movie is the sequel to `The Terminator' and `Terminator 2.' The rise of the machines has more explosions, more action, and a better plot than the earlier two films. Terminator 3 `Rise of the Machines' is directed by Jonathon Mostow. The movie is about machines that look like people sent from the future to protect or kill John Connor (Nick Stahl). The machines are called terminators. The terminator that is sent back to keep John Connor alive is well acted by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The big difference with this movie is that the terminator is not just sent back in time to protect the beloved John Connor, but is there to protect Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). The reason is because Kate and John are supposed to get married in the future and later their children will become important to mankind.<br/><br/>John Connor is important, because he is to protect the world from the machines. He becomes the leader of the people. On the day of the ending of the world, as we know it, is very close, and he will save the people that are left. The movie has another terminator called the T-X (Kristanna Loken). She is the perfect hot chick to play the part of a terminator. She is sent back in time to kill John Connor and all of his lieutenants. The plot has thickened; John and Kate must survive to ensure the survival of mankind in the future. I believe this movie is better than the first and second films."

","This film shouldn't have been made, simple. I loved the Terminator franchise, but losing James Cameron wasn't a good thing. Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either.

"slightlymad22","6","2","4","25 July 2016"," Schwarzenegger And The Franchise Deserve Better Than This
","Continuing my plan to watch every movie in Arnold Schwarzenegger's filmography in order, I come to Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines. <br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: John Connor is living off the grid, but a new advanced Terminator, is sent back to change the past once more. Luckily the humans had also sent a bodyguard back again too. <br/><br/>Where to start...... <br/><br/>In basically a retread of T2, there were scenes of violence and action, with some dreary talk in between. Everything was just so Bland and uninteresting. The Terminator franchise was officially becoming a bore. <br/><br/>First of all, the writers of the movie didn't even like Terminator movies and admittedly took the job just for the money. In his own blog, John Brancato says he and Ferris took the job because Ferris wanted a new house. Why Jonathan Mostow (another with no respect for the source material or the franchise) was given the job of directing is anybody's guess, but Arnie had approval, in his mega 33 page contract written by a super Hollywood lawyer. <br/><br/>Arnie's Terminator is a joke right from his first scene, it's almost a parody!! A total disgrace. John Connor is an incompetent fool, and the way the T-X goes around taking down her victims is ludicrous. Take the drive thru guy for example. She not only knew he was working that night, but also that he was serving at the drive thru?? PLEASE!! Considering she can change her appearance, she only does so once. Also considering this is time travel, why didn't Skynet, give her more than a few hours to try and kill 22 targets?? Even if they were all in L.A. The full thing is just full of holes!! The lack of respect for the franchise is apparent, and if the writers and director didn't care, why should the audience?? <br/><br/>The ending saved it a little bit, but not enough to redeem everything that came before it.<br/><br/>Arnie, wooden as an old oak beam, looks as if he were desperately wishing he was somewhere else. His performance here is miles away from the first two, and for the first time, I'm going to say he phones it in. <br/><br/>12 years ago, thanks to T2, he was the world's No 1 action Star. He not only laughed all the way to the bank... He bought it. But what of Schwarzenegger now. Nothing had come up trumps since Eraser 7 years ago..... There is nothing he can do, and he does very little. Throughout the whole affair he looks old, tired and bored. <br/><br/>Audiences still lapped up Terminator 3, to the tune of a $150 million domestic gross, making it the 8th highest grossing movie of the year. <br/><br/>I'm torn between a 5 or 6/10 on this one. It's certainly better than his last three movies, but it's an awful Terminator movie."

","(Grammar Issues Beware)If you checked out my latest IMDb review of Dracula II:Ascension I know I teased that Christmas Vacation was going to be the next review but I changed my mind to this one but I'll get to that sooner or latter.<br/><br/>With big success in The Terminator a even bigger success was created in Terminator 2:Judgement Day so with all this success a Terminator 3 was going to happen regardless or our liking or not and now that we got it I'm happy about it.<br/><br/>I fully heartily respect the opinions of others but I think the major drop down in critical success of this film is invalid and is bent up on people's blind admiration of James Cameron's work and not allowing another person to take on the property.<br/><br/>Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines starts out with some effective monologue by John Connor himself and then we are given a buffet of terrific scenes with a stylish first courter of the film with the Terminatix killing off the kid throwing the party and the burger point employee.Then the rest of the film transitions to a lot more substance instead of the style of the first courter of the film with a slow bonding between a frightened Katherine Brewster and a confused John Connor of which has matured greatly after the events of T2 I like that element of the film.The film goes on to have awesome action scenes like the shoot out at the Cemetery and at the Skynet branch.The film's main issue is it's bland,dull & almost complete mockery of the Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator as seen in the film but the Terminatix was cool enough to ease the pain of Arnold's painful profromance of which he certainly made up for with his improvement in Genysis.The film has a bleak and awesome ending for a film of this kind of which could've went for the happy cheery ending of T2 but I admire the chance of the ending of this one.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 by a technical level is a better made film but in certain elements T3 outshines T2."
"ericwatkinson","7","2","4","18 August 2015"," Look Again - There Are Different Levels To This Film
","I honestly don't understand how so many people can claim to dislike Rise of the Machines, so much, and sometimes I wonder if people are attempting to trash this film, just to show how smart and sophisticated they think they are? To begin with, the CGI special effects found in Terminator 3 are superior to those found in the following two films, and if you're not sure about that, all you need to do is compare the sequence in which the Terminatrix flips the big boom truck in Terminator 3, to the school bus accident scene in Terminator 5. In Terminator 3 we get to see paint fall off as sheet-metal buckles, a wheel falls off the truck in slow motion along with the broken wheel studs, and the frame of the boom truck bends and collapses in a completely believable manner. However, in Terminator 5, the school bus appears to inexplicably twirl and pirouette all over the Golden Gate Bridge, as if the laws of physics have somehow magically been repealed, yet at the same time the passenger compartment of the bus seems to ridiculously stay intact as the bus violently flips, and none of the main characters sustain any noteworthy injuries, or are thrown from the bus! One of the other things that also makes Terminator 3 such a great film is the believability of the characters. When the Terminatrix rips the door off of Katheryn Brewster's truck, Claire Danes uses her considerable acting skills to make you believe that she is as terrified out of her mind as a real person would be under those circumstances! (Nothing like that happens in the following films.) Also, in Terminator 3 the character of John Connor is so far from the gruff talking cutout superheroes found in Terminators 4 & 5, that he is actually so overcome with despair twice in the film, that the Terminator must intervene in order to prevent him from killing himself. Nick Stahl does a passable job of portraying John Connor as deep-seated loner with a lot of personal flaws, and the John Connor character found in Terminator 3 in light years beyond the cardboard John Connor character found in Terminators 4 & 5! It's not Shakespeare, but I think that a lot of people are missing important aspects of this film, and while your watching it, pay attention to the physics found in the CGI effects."

","For me, T-3: Rise of the Machines was fun to watch and after finishing it I walked away smiling. The movie is technically brilliant, the CGI makeup of the terminator on the good side is outstanding, the film has outstanding wit and the action is exhilarating. My favorite scene of the entire film is the particularly good action scene where the good terminator is fighting against the nasty T-X near the end of the film in the toilet room and that scene was punchy entertainment. And how nice that a woman leading character is given a chance in this movie to prove to us that women in movies are capable of a few things and don't always need to rely on men leading characters for help. Youhou, go for girls' equal rights oh yeah. However I think that her character and character's role in the story would have been better and bigger if we saw her do more brave and/or responsible thing(s) rather than just one act of bravery and responsibility. Another flaw that T-3: Rise of the Machines has unfortunately fallen prey to is that it lacks the ruthless, scary and sharp feel of the dark future for which the good characters are fighting to prevent, from the previous two films. And I also need to mention the script which is soulless as a piece of storytelling and obvious and doesn't give away anything special like in the previous two films and that can also include the characters and emotion(s). Not only that but the dialogue in the film is simplistic and there aren't enough dialogue lines between the two main characters of the movie: John Connor and Kate Brewster. Still, despite T-3: Rise of the Machines not being a perfect movie it is a worthy addition to the Terminator franchise, there is no doubt about it. Thank you very much Mr. Jonathan Mostow for delivering us exactly the type of thrills we want. Everyone, rise your champaign and give toast to... T-3: Rise of the Machines. My rating for this movie: 7.2/10"
"hnt_dnl","9","2","4","2 May 2010"," I enjoyed the highly underrated T3 more than T2!
","I know hardcore T2 fans will call it blasphemy...but IMHO, 2003's TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (T3) is a more ENJOYABLE movie AND a BETTER film than T2! I re-watched T2 to get a handle on it's praise and conclude that it can ONLY be for the incredible special effects. T2 literally comes to a screeching halt for a good hour and that is one tedious hour filled with cheesy dialog, rambling, and pontification. And the plot of T2 is paper thin! Everything that happens feels staged. It is probably the least necessary film of the ""trilogy"".<br/><br/>T3 follows a similar formula to T1 and T2 and again has the ""good"" Terminator, the T800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger in his last big film role before retiring from acting and going into politics) arrives in early 21st century LA. I'm glad to report that Arnie is SPOT ON in T3! Arnie is as iconic to the 80s and 90s as an action star as Clint Eastwood was to the 60s and 70s. Great to see the legend go out on a high note! Amazing that the past middle-aged man could light up the screen in a great action movie as well as he could 20 years earlier.<br/><br/>Ironically, the T800's task this time is not to save John Connor, but to save Katherine ""Kate"" Brewster (played by Clare Danes in an underrated performance). Kate is John's future wife and a key member of the future rebellion against the machines. Danes in T3 reminds me a lot of Linda Hamilton from T1, a sweet, vulnerable character with an unexplored inner toughness.<br/><br/>The evil Terminator this time is the highly advanced TX (played excellently by the incredible-looking Kristanna Loken; that's right, a Terminatrix!). The TX can not only take the form of people she comes in contact with (like T1000 in T2), but also she is equipped with a weapons arsenal that is able to do damage to Arnie's more obsolete T800. I don't know what movie the naysayers of this film were watching, but Loken is out and out terrific in this role and not once did I think she was anything but a machine (albeit a sexy looking one!). And I think that her performance is lot more attributable to Loken over the CGI, whereas a great amount of Robert Patrick's role in T2 was DUE to CGI.<br/><br/>Never fear, because John Connor is in this, too! John is roaming LA as a vagrant (taking odd jobs to survive) to conceal his identity from any more Terminators that may come to find him. John's introduction in T3 is rather unsettling as it appears he has lost all hope and may be ready to end it all. John is played superbly by Nick Stahl, in a truly under-appreciated performance. Stahl delivers a very subtle, nuanced performance. I found his actions and reactions to be authentic. Also, Stahl ACTUALLY looks like he could be the product of Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton from T1, resembling both actors, which adds to the authenticity of his character; you can actually see parts of both Reese and Sarah from T1 in Stahl's John! Stahl is the glue that holds T3 together for me.<br/><br/>The Terminators arrive at the same time as John at Kate's vet clinic and the T800 saves John and Kate from the TX, then a chase ensues. T3 is very similar to T1 in that it's tone is fast-paced and bleak. I'm not putting T3 on the same level as T1! T3 is a bit closer to the modern action movie than the sleeper low budget art film that T1 turned out to be, but it has a lot of heart, just like T1 had.<br/><br/>Being a sequel, it borrows situations from T1 and T2, like the obligatory opening scene of Arnie confronting yet another ""lowlife"" to acquire clothing. But I was amazed at how deftly this, and many other, scenes were handled. The director Jonathan Mostow did a great job of generating wit and humor from cliché situations, mostly due to the efforts of the deadpan Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>T3 seems like less of an ""epic"" film than T2, which I don't think a bad thing, and is amazingly short for a modern day Hollywood summer movie. The way that Doomsday approaches and the machines take over is a tad spotty for me, but the ending of T3 is one of the better, most provocative ones I've seen in a movie in YEARS and actually serves as a fitting end to the franchise (of course there are more sequels out there!).<br/><br/>Last but not least, T3 has some GREAT action scenes! The early big chase scene where the advanced TX operates all those vehicles in unison is a contender for BEST action sequence of the decade! The climactic scenes, including the big showdown between the T800 and the TX, are pulse-poundingly good! The feasibility of T3's action scenes stem from real stunts/effects and limited, spare use of CGI.<br/><br/>Again, I think the characters are easy to root for in this. Stahl and Danes give John and Kate a pleasant innocence yet underlying toughness and evolve convincingly during the film and prove to be worthy to hold the mantle of saviors of the human race. And Loken, if a bit sexed up in this film, is quite convincing as a robot. Believe me, this could have EASILY been a laughable performance and she is surprisingly MORE THAN GOOD. Finally, the legendary Mr. Schwarzenegger proves that he could still handle an action film in his final acting days!<br/><br/>The fact that James Cameron didn't direct this is a plus as far as I'm concerned. I think most of his movies after T1 are immensely overrated. He's not the best storyteller and T2 was proof of that. In the end, T3 is an excellent action movie worthy of being part of the Terminator franchise...My two cents!"
"CuriosityKilledShawn","8","2","4","5 January 2007"," Judgment Day. The End of the World. It's today. Three hours from now!
","I'm probably going to lose instant credibility by saying this, but I think that T3 is the best in the series. Yes, T2 and the original are brilliant but T3 is simply all action from start to finish. It's a breathless, relentless thrill-ride that doesn't let up until the shocking, refreshingly downbeat climax.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl easily steps into the role of John Connor, vacated by Eddie Furlong and surpasses him in terms of acting and character development. T3 takes place over a couple of days but the actors still get enough out of the sudden, fast-paced plot developments to prevent them from simply being furniture. I was surprised at how emotional and engaging Nick Stahl's performance was as I had previously thought he was totally inappropriate for the part.<br/><br/>T3 has Connor as some sort of Ronin type character, living separate from the rest of humanity, paranoid that Skynet may be able to track his footsteps in the future and send a Terminator to kill him. He knows he destroyed Cyberdyne and everything SHOULD be okay, but something else just stops him from keeping in touch with the world. Plus Sarah Connor is dead, leaving a John alone in an unstable time.<br/><br/>Computer networks are failing across the planet and there seems to be a giant ghost in the machine. Everyone seems oblivious to the brewing trouble until the T-X and the T-800 step out of the time displacement field, hellbent on blowing each other and the city to smithereens.<br/><br/>Amazing special effects, stunt work and CGI make up the rest of the movie, which is essentially one huge chase. I found it to be pretty seamless when I first saw it but upon repeat viewings you can tell what's fake and what's not. But only if you look really hard. T3 uses its effects to make a good movie, not just a pretentious trailer. Something that so many shallow effects movies do.<br/><br/>Of course there are problems. As always in a film with such a white-knuckle momentum, plot coherence is sacrificed for timing. Why is Kate Brewster and her boyfriend shopping in the middle of the night? How on earth would Connor's Leutenant's have survived Judgment Day when they clearly live in the middle of LA and would have been fried to a crisp? There are also some continuity problems with the first 2 movies not the least of which are the wildly incorrect character ages. But even James Cameron himself didn't define this too clearly in T2. And why is Arnie's Terminator model now called a T-101? He's a T-800: Cyberdyne Systems Model 101. A couple of quick exposition scenes could have made all this nice and neat. But they couldn't be bothered I guess. This is probably why so many fans of Cameron's entries turned their noses up that T3.<br/><br/>I find it unlikely that there will ever be a Terminator 4. Arnie is too busy to commit himself to a time-consuming project like that and it just wouldn't be a Terminator movie without him. Despite being 55 in this he still looks pretty good (if only the same could be said for Seagal eh?) for an obsolete model."

","I went to see this movie with open-arms and was rewarded with a wonderful action film (the best in the year) that totally lived up to the hype and my expectations.<br/><br/>The CG is far superior to T1 and T2, and the acting never had any embarrassingly corny lines--like Terminator 1 (and the romance never did it for me in that film).<br/><br/>The new Terminator (TX) is played rather well by Kristanna Loken, and the design of this cyborg is fantastic---a noted improvement from the T-1000, who I thought was a bit of a wimp.<br/><br/>Of course, this movie belongs to Arnie, who commands the screen and has some very good scenes. As for Stahl and Danes, they are perfectly cast, and Stahl is a relief from someone who thought the Edward Furlong John Connor was pretty painful.<br/><br/>Those two actors really do play second fiddle to the action here, which looks spectacular, and sadly (for some) does not leave as much room for character development as T1 and T2.<br/><br/>However, if you're interest in the Terminator series is generally for the action and less about whether Terminators ""really can love and learn the value of human life"", then you will absolutely adore this movie, and without a doubt find it a welcome addition to the former 2.<br/><br/>If, you are an aficionado of the series, you will be hard-pressed to find the human elements of the former two movies, although it goes without saying that there is a ton of information about the Machine uprising here that you would do well to take into account.<br/><br/>I personally loved this film, and, while not yet considered the classic of T1 and T2, it is only a matter of time."

","Reading a lot of negative reviews and that really saddens me.<br/><br/>I too did not like it that Cameron did not want to direct this movie. But that is his mistake. I would have done it as it would have been a sure hit and it was a huge box office hit. But it is also a good movie.<br/><br/>The story is excellent. Sure it does not match the story from the first two movies but that is because the future was changed because of the interventions from the first two movies. With Cyberdyne destroyed a future was also destroyed.<br/><br/>But Judgment Day was or rather is inevitable and that is where the movie shines. I mean Judgment Day IS coming. And it is not some movie thing but the future of humanity. Our arrogance will be our undoing one day and the first two Terminator movies made me realize that. This movie ends in the only way I feel it could have ended. With the near destruction of the human race.<br/><br/>It was a new ending and a most controversial one. But I loved it. Not a crappy ending where the humans stop the evil machines or alien invasion. But an ending where we are on the losing side. It was most unexpected but that is what I loved.<br/><br/>I also liked the T-X. It seemed right to have a female Terminator and Kristanna Loken played her parts nicely. And Arnold was great as his usual character. Of course the older Terminator model stood little or no chance against the T-X but that was not the point. The Terminator's mission was to ensure the survival of John and Katherine and not to fight the T-X.<br/><br/>It seems a bit odd for the resistance to send such an old Terminator model back trough time but this was probably the best they could get. Which would make sense as the T-X is probably a prototype and/or very costly to produce. The T-101 's are foot soldiers so obtaining one of those would be easier.<br/><br/>John and Katherine were well cast and played their roles perfectly. Stahl really looked as if the weight of the world was on his shoulders.<br/><br/>There were a few minor complaints such as Dr. Silberman. It was neat to see him again but he was head of a entire mental hospital. How did he get to work for a Sheriff's office? I guess seeing the T-1000 really drove him over the edge.<br/><br/>I also missed the few key phrases such as ""I'll be back."" ""Or Come with me if you want to live."" I mean the first is one of the best movie quotes ever so having it omitted in this movie was a downer.<br/><br/>But the story and action scenes were excellent. The story did not measure up to Terminator or Terminator 2 but was still excellent. There was not a dull moment in the movie whatsoever and even though it was rather straightforward the ending made it perfect.<br/><br/>Thanks to the T-X's ability to control other vehicles, the chase scene could be expanded upon greatly, having several vehicles chase the heroes which was a very cool idea and well executed. The other action scenes did their part as well as did the fight scenes.<br/><br/>By the way, I loved those. Sure it may be silly watching Arnie fight a woman but it makes sense. Generally woman are seen as the ""weaker"" sex although there are a lot of woman whom that does NOT apply to. But still, a woman tends to blend in the crowds easier than a big muscle man such as Arnold. Which seems to be what a Terminator does best.<br/><br/>She could of course take on the form of other humans and at one point she could have killed Kate in the guise of her fiancée but instead reverted to her normal form. Seeing how Kate needed to survive this error was necessary but I like to think that the T-X was just over confident and changed back or perhaps needed to do so in order to access its weaponry.<br/><br/>And I am not really a nitpicker because then one can nitpick about a lot of stuff. I mean, in Terminator Sarah is last seen with a dog just in case a Terminator does appear. If John is so worried about the future (and trying not to be registered anywhere so to avoid being tracked), why does he not have a dog himself? I would have one.<br/><br/>So I ignore those little tidbits and focus on the good stuff. Which this movie has in spades. I know it is not Terminator 1 or 2 but this movie is still a great addition to the franchise."

","Although this film 'Terminator 3' Rise of the machines wasn't as good as the first two Terminator films, I can still say that I enjoyed this film. Considering how very few of the original actors were in this film, that were in the first two Terminator films, other than Arnold Swartzeneger the Terminator and Earl Boen(Dr.Peter Silberman) who was Sarah Connors Psychiatrist, I thought this film carried itself extremely well. I thought the lighting and special effects were superb and the directors choice of making the new Terminator into a woman was a great and original idea. <br/><br/>In many ways I found this sequel somewhat more humorous compared to the other Terminator films, a humour that the other films lacked. The scene when the Terminatrix(Kristanna Loken) breasts grew larger after looking at the large breasted women on the billboard poster and when Arnold Swartzeneger(the Terminator) walked into the strip club in the nude, for everybody thought that he was a stripper hired by the nightclub, I found extremely funny. I did, however, find it unrealistic when the Terminator was deprogrammed by the Terminatrix to become bad and then mentally fought his deprogramming to remain good and managing to shut his system down. That was so unreal! Why - because the Terminator is a Cyborg, not a person. It doesn't have feelings of its own. Its programmed to follow his orders - nothing more. <br/><br/>As all Terminator fans know, that John Connors father(Kyle Rhys) who was one of John Connors Sergeants in the future was sent back in time to the year 1984 to save Johns mother(Sarah Connor) from being killed by the Terminator. It would have been good if the Terminator named John Connors fathers name(Kyle Rhys) to John Connor(Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster(Claire Danes) when he was telling them the listed names of the Terminatrix' assassin hitlist, who were John Connors top Sergeants/ Lieutenants in the future, that she was planning to kill. That would have been ironic for this film, for his father(Kyle Rhys) was one of John Connors top Sergeants in the year 2027, but unfortunately his name wasn't mentioned on that list. Then again, it was only fair that he wasn't on the hit list for Kyle Rees wasn't alive in the year 1997 as he was born in the year 2006. <br/><br/>Despite the ways I feel this film could have improved, I still very much enjoyed it and would recommend anybody to watch it, as this film had amazing special effects, exciting action scenes and most of all had a fantastic storyline."

","Trilogies almost never work. Few franchises have enough steam to get to #3 without a misstep ... frankly, I can't think of any other examples.<br/><br/>But T3 breaks the trilogy curse. The smartest move the filmmakers made was deciding not to try to outdo T2. T2 is an epic masterpiece, and trying to take that to the next level would have been near impossible. Instead, that brought things down a notch, made a smaller story, added more humor.<br/><br/>The result is a small, wonderful film. Well, relatively small anyway. It still delivers on the action -- the big chase scene code be the greatest car chase ever committed to film. And the ending ... it's the most powerful conclusion of any film in the series.<br/><br/>Kudos to the mind behind T3 for taking a project that could have been a disaster and making a terrific piece of cinema out of it."

","This film is a terrible letdown for what were an incredible first two films. It has used a name ""Terminator"" to make millions on a story that realistically is not worth the paper its written on. Im surprised that Arnold would even attach his name to this film, but undoubtedly a six figure number probably helped. It is rubbish. Poor acting coupled with a poor script leads to disastrous affects! as we clearly see in this movie. The fact that we have a woman terminator making mince meat out of Arnold (the figure) that James Cameron spent so much time making a legend of in the first to films. Instead of being the man of steal that we admired in the first two films Arnold is now more like a cross between Ricky Gervais and Vinnie Jones. Shame on whoever developed this film for letting an amateur (Jonathan Mostow) take the steering wheel of something that has over the years earned massive recognition only to smash it with what was to be known as Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.

","The first two ""Terminator"" films were classics and, given the disappointments of Arnold Schwarzenegger's more recent movies (such as ""End Of Days"" and ""The Sixth Day""), it was obviously enormously tempting to return to his most famous and iconic role, even after an interval of 12 years. But it was a wise decision - Arnie has shaped up (literally) and cleaned up at the box office in a return to form that might yet prove to be a platform to political success that terminates his 'acting' career.<br/><br/>
Director James Cameron has now left the scene and his role is taken over by Jonathan Mostow who - as we know from the history-twisting, but action-laded ""U-571"" - is a competent producer of exciting movies. Like all sequels, ""T3"" is formulaic -a repetition of the key elements of earlier movies in the franchise with a few variations. But it is a winning formula and the obligatory road chase sequence is really well done, while the main twist - a female terminator - works effectively with Kristanna Loken looking chillingly attractive. I especially enjoyed the use of new machines.<br/><br/>There is no real plot or character development, but the storyline remains honest to the original premise that Armageddon is inevitable. Above all, it thoroughly entertaining as, as Arnie comments at one point: ""Your levity is good - it relieves tension and the fear of death"". A couple of lines leave open a possible return to the franchise and, since terminators obviously come in many forms, this could even happen without Arnie if he proves to be busy running California. One way or another, I'm convinced he'll be back."

","I know it's easy to put ""Terminator 3"" down. Everybody had great expectations and it was clear that this movie would have lots of enemies, especially if someone else than Cameron was going to direct. So, here it is now, T3, and the truth is, it is a good action movie, just not as good as Terminator 1 & 2.<br/><br/>What I liked best about this movie is that it doesn't include any martial arts. Since ""The Matrix"" came out, I often wondered if it would even be possible to make an action movie without Kung Fu anymore. Also, Mostow really tried to not only focus on the action but include some story and character development, too. The problem is, the story is nowhere near as good as it used to be. The writers mistook character development for endless whiney monologues by John Connor, supposed leader of mankind. Where Cameron always found the right balance between someone explaining what was going on and action scenes, T3 fell into the trap of slowing down too often.<br/><br/>What's bothering me even more, is that writers really had a lot of chances to turn Terminator 3"" into an interesting story that picked up from the end of T2. I hoped that finally we'd get an explanation for why only one Terminator is sent back at a time, how the time portal works, how CyberDyne recreated the information on future technology after it had been destroyed in part 2, etc. Instead writers gave vague or no hints at all to previous riddles and went away too far from the original ideas of Terminator"". No fate but what we make for ourselves"" we were told in parts 1 & 2. Now it has changed to Judgement Day is inevitable"". Why is that, you may ask yourself and why would a Terminator know that? It's only one of many things that don't really make sense. A fact that's even more annoying when you think about how perfect the series has been so far. Sure, James Cameron had also made mistakes (John's and Sarah's age, for instance) but the main story did always make sense.<br/><br/>Mostow obviously was afraid of stepping into Cameron's shoes and be compared to him, so he decided to put several nods to the previous movies in sequel no. 2. Nice thought, but T3 is definitely too much of a nod"" to T1 & T2. It's part parody, part rip-off that has only few new elements. Again there are two Terminators, one brand new, one obsolete, we get a spectacular car chase, desert scenes, etc. Furthermore, we get a funny version of the bar scene at the beginning and a funny"" cameo by infamous psychiatrist Dr. Silberman. Yes, some of the jokes are actually quite funny, but really, why would the Terminator smash the gay glasses? Come on, this is supposed to be a serious movie! The worst thing about all this repeating old stuff is that this time there's no suspense whatsoever. It just feels like we've seen it before and we know exactly what's coming.<br/><br/>One scene that could have brought a cool twist to the movie was the one where Arnold gets reprogrammed by the T-X. It would have been so cool, if the T-800 had turned into the bad guy again now. It would have showed that a machine knows no loyalty. Instead we got the most stupid scene ever in a Terminator"" movie: John Connor asks the T-800 not to kill him and the Terminator obeys. Reese said in part 1 It can't be bargained with"" and now John did just that. Sad. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. And what's with John Connor? Isn't he the one who will go on to lead mankind? In T3, he isn't much of a leader to me. Is it the writers fault or Nick Stahl's, I don't know, but the character is such a sissy in this movie, it's painful.<br/><br/>About the T-X: why the hell isn't that thing bigger, stronger, faster? The T-X has no real improvements compared to the T-1000 and it seems to be really stupid. How else could it lose to the trashy T-800?

","The first time I watched this movie I was unimpressed, considering the action overwhelming to the relationships. There is no question that the first chase scene goes on far too long and seems to have the sole purpose of simply smashing up cars, buildings and other collateral objects. What made the second movie so good was the dialog and the expanding relationship between the Schwarzenegger terminator and the young John Connor. It reached the point where the good terminator begins to take on some human characteristics and is considered a father figure.
The evil terminator in this movie is powerful, far more than even the one in the second movie. The Schwarzenegger terminator is obsolete and in this movie is also almost exclusively robotic, showing no human-like intonation or facial expression. The evil terminator is also female, yet it also never expresses anything resembling emotions of any kind. The evil male terminator in the second movie occasionally had human-like facial expressions and did not always speak in monotone.
There are some amusing sight gags, specifically regarding the vehicles and when Schwarzenegger rescues John Connor by carrying him in a coffin. Yet, it ends with the very depressing idea that the thermonuclear war known as judgement day was inevitable, something that contradicts the ending of the second movie. It is natural to want the human race to win, not face extinction at the hands of its own electronic creations."

","There was a period of time between when I was at university and when I started writing reviews for films again that I had become somewhat distracted. In fact there was a period of time when I didn't see all that many films at all, with the exception of some really big name ones that I absolutely had to see – Terminator 3 was one of them. I guess the reason was because ever since Terminator 2 I wanted to see a version set in the future where they are fighting the robots, and a part of me was expecting the third installment to be that movie. Unfortunately, as it turned out, this wasn't to be the case. In fact it seems, in many aspects, simply a remake of the second film – pretty much more of the same.<br/><br/>This time we are ten years in the future and John Conner is now in his early twenties. He is a drifter, his mother is dead, and it seems as if the world has been freed from Skynet. Well, the problem is that John still seems to be having these nightmares, so he is wandering whether he can actually relax. It is clear that he can't because he is simply drifting, off the grid, simply trying to survive while hoping that the world doesn't blow itself up. Unfortunately that isn't going to be the case because two more terminators come back from the future, one to protect him and one to not only attempt to kill him, but to also kill his lieutenants.<br/><br/>As I suggested, this film is basically just a rehash of the plot of the second film, which boils down to the simple line of two robots slugging it out. Sure, we have Arnie returning to reprise his role as the T800 (actually it is the T850 now, which is somewhat better than the previous two), but we also have another terminator come back, this one being a more advanced version that can now create energy weapons as opposed to simply knives and stabbing weapons. Mind you, it felt a little contrived since it seemed that the T-1000, that was pure living metal, was somewhat more advanced than this new one that happened to have an endo-skeleton.<br/><br/>I have since discovered that the second movie was supposed to be the end of the franchise, but obviously the demand for sequels was just that little too high, which is why we have had it resurrected in this third, forth, and fifth movie. However, the idea behind the film, in that while Cyberdyne was destroyed, the idea of Skynet wasn't, does hold a lot of water. For instance, the suggestion is that Miles wasn't the only person that worked at home. The other thing is that the movement of technology was inevitable. All we need to do is look about us today to see how the movement towards AI is progressing, and more so, despite the warnings that are given to us in not only movies like Terminator, but also Isaac Asimov, we seem to be blindly charging into the future once again. Who knows, one day we may wake up under the rule of our robot overlords."

","James Cameron's Terminator films were both masterful slices of science fiction, and one of the best robots in cinema history (Played blankly in the best possible way by Arnold Schwarzenegger) left his dent in popular culture. Terminator 2 had a great ending, so we didn't need a sequel. For 11 years they managed to resist the temptation, but eventually they gave in. James Cameron wisely decided not to return, and some random director (Jonathan Mostow) directs the next chapter, as a different terminator in Arnie's shape returns to protect John Connor and his future wife from another robotic assassin. T3 does a decent enough job and could have been worse. The Terminator films benefit from an interesting storyline about fate and the apocalypse, and a surprising amount of emotion for films starring robots has kept all 3 afloat. T3 has a more distant, but still palpable, emotional core. In terms of action, the film does not disappoint and delivers many a thrilling, explosive set pieces full of well executed explosion heaven.<br/><br/>A problem which is the main reason why none of the films got a 10 from me is that the Terminator films are too reliant on chase scenes which can become repetitive. Until the strong final third, the film often feels like an extended chase sequence and peaks too early. There's still a decent plot, but the main characters are annoying and the antagonist is just a blank female version of the T-1000. The CGI doesn't look as ground-breaking as it did in 1992, so she's lame. Plenty of entertainment weighed down by a routine script carries on, until the interesting final act where Judgement Day happens and this twist makes sure the film leaves a better legacy than it might have done. T3 doesn't need to exist, but it could have been a lot worse. Not a spectacular sequel, but still entertaining and not as bad as some other third chapters. It's not another The Godfather Part III.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines is a great movie with a clever story line,a brilliant cast and fantastic characters.Its the third in The Terminator series,and it is a fresh threequel,but fans of the first and second Terminator will definitely be disappointed by it.It isn't directed by James Cameron this time,and you can tell he has no involvement in it,it is directed by Jonathan Mostow,a rather unknown director.I didn't like how it was trying to be humorous at tmes,while I will admit I did laugh,I didn't like the idea of finding a Terminator movie funny,for example,the scene where Arnold puts on the Elton John glasses.Fans of the Terminator may enjoy it,but will be disappointed compared to the previous two.<br/><br/>The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) returns to protect John Connor,who is now twenty years old and his future wife from the T-X as they head towards Judgement Day."

","The third outing in the series is every bit as action packed as the first two, from start to finish the there is superb action throughout. The introduction of a 'female' terminator adds a unique dynamic to the series which is surprisingly very interesting. The dialogue however has steadily deteriorated and the ""she'll be back"" and ""I'll be back"" is beginning to wear a bit thin. The plot is not very engaging and is in fact often predictable - save for the twist at the end. The performances are quite adequate throughout the film and Schwarzenegger fans will not be disappointed. Overall an action packed sequel which does not disappoint."

True some of the phrases in the other films were not said in the exact same way as they were in this one, but I still think it is quite enjoyable. It has lots of action and it is well paced. Arnold Schwarzenegger was just amazing in his role as the terminator. He again plays the protector of the leader of the resistance, John Connor. Just like he did in Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

The special effects were ahead of it's time, and the infamous James Cameron gave us what we wanted; something new. Everything was amazing. Then we had Terminator 2, which roundhouse kicked the original in the face. Everything was improved, from the acting to the action, and takes it's place as the best action sci-fi; ever. Then in 2003, a new director tries to revive the beautiful insanity of James Cameron. And as another review states; a good, but flawed, attempt at reviving James Cameron's masterpieces. And it could not be said better. The film starts out amazingly, I had high expectations in the first place. Then shortly after, you can tell the atmosphere has definitely changed... First off, the director tried feeding the film a slight dosage of humor. It some cases it works but others it is cringe-worthy. The action may considered over-the-top in some cases but the redeeming qualities include the infamous crane scene. Then we have the similarities to it's predecessor. Although not exactly the same thing, many things have noticeably been copied of T2. Example: Why was Arnold the protector of John Connor again? Why couldn't they have added some other mission for him; something original. Nevertheless, it still isn't a big factor to it's score. Then after reviewing it's bad qualities, the film does have it's times where you end up liking it. And then concluding this review, I have high expectations for Salvation, knowing that is has originality and following up to this fantastic trilogy. The Skynet war has just begun.

They made two good movies that told a good story and had a near-perfect ending and they should have left it alone. But, Hollywood is all about making money, and for a few million dollars they were willing to undo that ending and create a new one that was rather unsatisfying and makes you look back with skepticism on the efforts of the futuristic characters of the first two movies.

While the action and chase scenes are certainly gripping – with a chase through downtown L.A. being one of the highlights – the film is initially deterred by a few questionable special effects, and its lack of what made the first two installments so memorable: the diverse plot that touched on the emotions of the characters and audience alike. In addition, the film scarcely takes itself seriously, with a collection of gags and puns that sometimes diffuse the sense of pace.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the tragic final act of the film is bound to pull the heartstrings of even the most die-hard action fan, and gives a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy."

Hell, they could have even had some fun with it.<br/><br/>Then it occurred to me that my expectations were probably too high. I absolutely loved the first two ones.

My friend and his dad also enjoyed the film, they agreed it didn't match the first two but that it was still a good film. <br/><br/>This being the first ""Terminator"" movie I had seen I didn't know what to expect, I believed this helped me. Too many people compared this to the first two films and expected it to be the same, but it wasn't, it was actually a fairly good film, just not quite as good as the first two fantastic films. Because I had not seen the other two, I was able to see this one as a film and not just a stack up to the first two, thus I honestly believe it was a fairly good addition to the franchise.<br/><br/>The T-X (Kristanna Loken) though amazing in concept didn't exactly carry the coldness that T2's T-000 had, the result being, she was not as effective as she should have been. The acting itself wasn't a perfect gem, but it carried the story like it needed too and there was no particularly large flaw in it.<br/><br/>The reason that T3 wasn't as good as the previous movies is because it couldn't bear the emotional heavy lifting that its predecessors did. It didn't contain the emotional passion that Linda Hamilton gave to T2 or the gritty strength of Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese from the original ""Terminator"". <br/><br/>T3 does redeem itself though, the ending is one of the most powerful endings to a movie I've ever seen (to the point that it felt slightly disjointed from the rest of the movie). Now I'm not going to spoil it for any viewer who hasn't seen this movie, but the ending of this film is a shocker, especially to fans of the series (Then again with Terminator Salvation out already, most people who haven't seen T3 would have figured it out by now). <br/><br/>7.5/10 Very Good action film, see it."

Paid her more, given her more incentives or just written in a heroic role to which she couldn't have said no. Claire Danes is NOT an action star and, while I think she did okay in the role of action star, the movie was handicapped by her whiney presence along with that of the new ""John Connor."" What I really hated was how the ""Good"" Terminator character got sent back... or should I say WHO sent him back. The circumstances surrounding it, etc. I really felt, as I said, cheated by so many things in this movie.

","As with the years that passed between the first and second films, the speculation as to whether or not a third film was going to happen at all was very high. We all heard the conflicting statements of both Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron. Finally Cameron said he would do it if 20th Century Fox would release it. Obviously that didn't happen and Arnold changed his mind after saying No. The story of T3 is mediocre to average at best and I'll tell you why. To begin with, a lot of necessary exposition is missing. The writers essentially left out a major plot point with the former Cyberdyne Systems and Miles Dyson. Having a situation where Dyson designs Skynet's hardware and Brewster designs the software would have tied T3 a lot more strongly to the franchise. Another thing is what happens to Sarah Connor. This character has basically been the pennacle of the Terminator mythos. If the reigns have to pass from Sarah to John that's fine. But it would have worked better that we see her killed trying to escape after Skynet comes online. Lastly the concept of The Terminatrix. Now just to be clear, I don't mind a woman being a Terminator. What I do have a problem with is the writers splitting hairs trying to differentiate the T-X from the T-1000. Now we could all see the difference between Arnold and the T-1000. But if the best they can do is showing the T-X endo during a copy, then that won't cut it. There are ways to come up with new concepts on something established. Maybe that's where Cameron could have worked some magic. The only two things that worked for me were Arnold's description of what will happen in the future in terms of the war, and the ending surprised me though. It set up the fourth film pretty well. The missing elements Cameron's nightmarish vision and storytelling smoothness are what crippled this film. Not bad, but could have been better."

","When the production of Terminator 3 was announced, the first shocking news that I found was that James Cameron was no longer going to be the director. The other surprise was that the villain was going to be a female. Yes, it was going to be a female cyborg played by Kristanna Loken. With these two facts known, I was convinced that one ought not to expect anything from the third movie. And then came a ray of hope or was it? Arnold continues with his role as the Terminator. Well, I felt there was something to cheer about after all since it is not easy to imagine anybody else playing the Terminator.<br/><br/>When the trailer came out, I saw the clips of Kristanna Loken roaming almost nude in the streets and adjusting herself to look more attractive, I feared that the Terminator 3 was going to converge with the concept of Species movies i.e. a female villain moving around seducing men and eventually killing them. But thankfully, the movie was nothing like that and that was a relief for me, a big one indeed.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie was a disappointment for me. Firstly, we start out with a lame script. Improperly placed dialogs, really bad! Arnold says, ""She'll be back!"" Arnold steps inside a lady's night club completely nude. The first goggles he wears are weird star shaped ones! What are the script writers thinking? Are they making a sequel or a parody? I could not understand! I don't know about others but I surely could not understand why the director and the writer put in what they did! And then we come to Arnold Schwargenneger. He was so convincing in the first two movies. Speaking in a way that was so robotic. That strict tone of voice that indicated near lack of emotion in the first two movies was replaced by a tone of voice that is more anger and frustration. Sometimes, one may feel that Arnold is more like a frustrated soldier who has been sent to do something much against his wishes rather than a cyborg who is programmed to do a task and is free from the very concept of emotion.<br/><br/>For those of you who have seen the alternate ending of the Terminator 2 movie, you might realize that this ending does not allow the existence of this movie at all. But even when you choose to ignore the alternate ending of T2 where John Conner has become a senator and the Judgment Day has been prevented, you might not find the T3 as a worthy sequel."

A much smaller and older Arnold is back as yet another T-101 trying to save the young pair. The plot from this point is a virtual carbon copy of the second movie, only with louder explosions and longer chases. You can feel the script forcing and stretching this improbable scenario, especially since the whole Skylab issue was resolved at the end of T2. Director Mostow substitutes CGI-heavy action and chase sequences for any sense of forward plotting. T3 is strictly from hunger. Arnold is simply awful and has no presence. Loken is a joke as a ""superior"" cyborg, not half as effective as Robert Patrick's shape-shifting machine in T2. Stahl and Danes do what little they can with this ramshackle story. The ending is bizarre and unsatisfying, to say the least. There is one chase sequence involving some rather large vehicles that, at least on TV, should keep the viewer awake for a bit. In the theater, this same sequence had so much CGI in it that I thought I was watching a badly made cartoon. If you catch this on regular TV, you have nothing to lose -- but it would be better if you know nothing about the first two movies. T3 throws away all sense of logic and character development."

What started as a hit low-budget sci-fi thriller (in THE TERMINATOR) turns into one of the most explosive and expensive blockbuster of all time (in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY). So what is there in store for audiences in TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES. Not to terribly much I'm afraid, as the film falls under the category of ""been-there-done-that"" for most of the scenes. Director James Cameron unfortunately leaves further involvement in this third film, and leaves the directorial reigns (as well much of the TERMINATOR legacy) to action director Jonathan Mostow, who isn't exactly a brand name a director. The new story (helmed by new batch of writers who are everything but James Cameron and Gale Ann Hurd).<br/><br/>But regardless of its shortcomings, TERMINATOR 3 isn't a total loss as it might have turned out. While he rushes the screenplay for production, Mostow does offer a nicely done batch of action sequences and nifty special effects to keep one busy. There's much action here to satisfy the conventional action fan, be it chase scenes or wild gun-play action (maybe even both in one scene). Arnold Schwarzenegger (before running for governor of California) returns as the ever-present emotionless futuristic cyborg once again sent to protect John Conner (Nick Stahl), now a messed-up drifter, from yet another mechanical creation from Skynet sent to the past to kill him. For a change (whilst not much), the new machine, called the T-X, is takes the form of a chick (played by Kristanna Loken), which is just as unstoppable as its predecessor, other than that there's very little else new nor interestingly unique about this new killing machine. In addition, the big bad machine from the violent future must also protect Conner's would be wife (played by Claire Danes). Their connections with each other? They were classmates once! It doesn't get much more complicated than that, now does it? While the writing leaves much to be desired, and its anticlimax of an ending (of an anticlimax of a sequel by the way!) leaves us wondering why we had to go through the events of this film in the first place. One more thing, the much beloved characters of the ass-kicking woman warrior Sarah Conner is sorrily missed, almost as much as a payoff to the character of John Conner, who is a disappointment here in this film. Still, nonetheless, TERMINATOR 3 is a decent action thriller, packed with action and thrills. Leave our cynicism and brains at the door, it's brainless summer season again, and TERMINATOR 3 is a decent effort of pure mainstream film-making. It's disappointing, but only as sequel.<br/><br/>Rating: *** out of 5."

And that was all thanks to James Cameron.<br/><br/>In 2003, Jonathan Moss (U-571) brings back the hero from the dead along with bringing a new plot to the film. The film still involves John Conner (Nick Stahl) grown up after witnessing the events where he could've been killed by the T-1000. He's a homeless person living on the street where his only survival is his strength and eating off medicine at a local stray pound. His mother Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) is dead so the kid's got nobody else left.<br/><br/>Now comes the villain in the movie. In the first movie Arnold played The Terminator going after Linda Hamilton and preventing her from having a son who would be the hero in the future; in T2 the villain was T-1000 killing anybody related to John Conner. Now the villain is not a man but a woman who goes by the name of T-X where her mission is to go after future military workers; she kills teenagers left and right from drive-thru restaurants to parties where her main target is Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) the daughter of a military general. Once Kate and John find out what's going on, they go out in hiding before The Terminator catches them and becomes their guardian.<br/><br/>T3: Rise of the Machines is okay fun.

","Everything that needed to be said and done was done so in Terminator 2. (Quite nicely, I might add.) There was absolutely no need to make enough another Terminator movie, proving that T3 was simply nostalgic masturbation on the studio's part.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 is basically one big homage to Terminator 2. There's nothing in T3 that wasn't done (and done better) in T2. Cameron clearly had a better handle on the story than Mostow, who spent the whole movie trying to convince the audience that he can throw down with the big boys. Reality, however, is against him, since T3 is nowhere near as entertaining as T2.<br/><br/>With the exception of Arnold, T3 has just about everything going against it. Claire Daines looks very out of place in this movie, Nick Stahl is a horrible John Conner, and the two have little to no chemistry together. The special effects are rather sloppy and the music is pretty mediocre. Even the action scenes aren't as good as T2. It's a twenty-first century Terminator film, but we can only have one expensive sequence (the fire truck)?! The one thing I do like about T3 is the notion that Judgment Day is inevitable. Fate is a time-honored and effective plot device, especially in stories involving time travel. While it doesn't even begin to fill in for the rest of what is lacking T3's plot, at least it provides a somewhat stable backbone.<br/><br/>On its own, Terminator 3 is an OK movie. It's flawed, but entertaining. In relation to its predecessors, however, it falls flat on its face. It's obvious that it was simply an effort to restart the franchise and keep the money-hose going."

","Don't get me wrong, I do NOT hate Terminator 3. In fact I think it completes the story, unless they do a T4(which is unlikely due to the main character's current position in politics) what I do hate about this film is the fact that they changed directors. WHY?!!! No other director can provide the fantasy and the magic that only James Cameron can provide. He came up with the idea for ""The Terminator"" in the first place! Having a Terminator movie without him is like the Beatles without John Lennon. Now that is out of the way, the action holds your attention like the first two films did. The car chases weren't that as exciting as the 1984 original, sorry. <br/><br/>T3 doesn't have the ""psycho killer"" mystique of T1 or the violent barrage cliffhanger feel of T2, which this movie obviously needs. T3 becomes interesting in which the first couple of scenes in which John Connor's lieutenants were killed one by one in this time. One was a slackjawed pothead executed during a party!! I love potheads you might find on Dude, Where's My Car executed by a stranger with a gun. Thus proving that Terminator 3 is a film that has its moments. It gives very interesting plot twists that no one...I mean no one sees coming. Like the fact that ""Judgement Day"" couldn't be stopped...(I know this sounds trite)only to be survived. Not only that but Skynet was created by cyberspace all current technology. Which is very chilling that something that lethal can be under our noses without our knowing about it. The action was just similar to Star Wars III but not as epic. To some degree it was comical, not a white-knuckle face off, which a Terminator movie should have to begin with. The ending wasn't that grand, it could've been better. The effects could've grander and in disturbing detail with people burning to a crisp and the full effect of global chaos. In conclusion, this was not a boring movie,this is an interesting one that should've done better."

Too many plot holes, out and out rip offs from the first two films and lack of originality makes me wonder what Arnie was thinking, reprising his role for this joke of a film. This film seems to have focused more on generating revenue than completing a classic film trilogy. There is a complete lack of substance and will only appeal to the lowest common denominator. Those who can't see past the one liners will probably enjoy it.

","Terminator I was very thrilling, and so was Terminator II. But for some reason Terminator III was not. What is wrong? Well, the actors (except Kristana Loken) are not very good, but that is nothing new and not very important in a movie of this sort. But in any story there has to be certain well defined rules that must be respected at all times. Any story will be completely ruined the moment elements or events are involved that could never exist or happen in the world of the story. In a fairy tale it is okay to include a hat that makes the bearer invisible. But if a person suddenly begins to make himself invisible without the hat (and without a good explanation), the story is immediately ruined. It is okay that Q equips James Bond with a gadget that only works in fantasy, but the story will be ruined if we can't at least believe that it might somehow be technically possible to make such a gadget. A terminator is supposedly a fantastic machine, and since it is from the future we are prepared to believe it can have a lot of fantastic abilities. But we are not, and should not be, prepared to believe that it can work magic! So since we all know that it takes some mechanical power to activate the brakes, to speed up the engine and to turn the wheels of a car, we also know that some machinery will simply have to be built in to enable a car to be remote-controlled. But this terminator just sticks a thin finger into the instrument board like she might be installing some software into a computer, and - hokus pokus - suddenly she is able to drive the car with her mind! This is by no means plausible, so the story immediately looses all excitement. And besides the car chase with the crane is not interesting, because it is just too incredible that the main characters are not killed."

Arnold ""Arnie-The Strong-Terminator-Conan-Governator"" Schwarzenegger is the T-101 and his antagonist is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. The T-X is called Terminatrix too. The plot is not very difficult to describe. The T-101 has to protect John Conner (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Clare Danes) who will be his wife and one of his lieutenants in the future. Ergo, they have to flee from the T-X because the T-101 is an old model. This flight is of course not without any action-sequences. At the end of the film the terminators destroy themselves mutual and the machines take over the world and complete control. John Conner and Kate Brewster can escape in a dugout. Therefore John Conner becomes the leader of the human beings in war against the machines.<br/><br/>Terminator3-Rise of the machines is a very good action-movie. There are real stunts and not only computer-animation. This film is really extra-ordinary and absolutely amazing. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the cyber-organism which comes out of the future for a third time. The film is worth watching. There are good special effects and explosions as in other good action-films. The ending of this Terminator-part is very unexpected. It looks like as if there could be a Terminator4. Some say that Schwarzenegger won't be the protagonist in the fourth film, because he is governor. Well, maybe in the fifth film. Somewhere was said that there already exits a script.

"Tone303","6","0","0","27 November 2004"," Why I think Terminator 3 doesn't deliver! - Spoilers
","I am a HUGE Terminator fan. I have seen both the first two movies inside out and backwards. Here is why I do not believe that Terminator three belongs on the same level as the first two. Forgive me if I leave out any information in my arguments and should anyone feel the desire to argue my points, then by all means you're more than welcome. The first thing that got me about the third movie was the emotion both the terminators showed. The terminator was set up as a relentless killing machine that doesn't show pity, remorse or fear, simply systematic destruction. Ironically, during the scene when the terminator is reprogrammed by the T-X he explains to John (rather emphatically) that he is a machine. That line would have been much more effective had it been delivered with the cold, hard apathy we saw in the first two terminators. Another emotional moment for the terminator was the T-X this time. *(This shouldn't be a spoiler but use discretion anyway) Just before the T-X is defeated she shows fear! If the terminator can't cry in the second movie after all he's been through, I find it very hard to believe that this T-X can be afraid.<br/><br/>*(Potential Spoilers in the following paragraph) That whole thing with the power cell really annoyed me. In the first terminator, he is crushed under a hydraulic press. He didn't blow up! In the third, they suddenly make it that if he suffers a massive blow to the chest he is in danger of exploding. Further more, I understand that this next comment could be taken as being a little nit-picky, but I believe it has to be said. At the end of the second movie the terminator specifically states that he cannot self-terminate, yet at the end of the third movie he decidedly drops the door on himself and the T-X, knowing it would destroy them both.<br/><br/>OK, John Conner is a wimp in this movie. By the end of the second movie he is supposed to be half ready for the war, and before Sarah died, she was supposed to have taught him to be a ""Great military leader"". How much of this showed in the third now that Judgment day was right around the corner? Also, Cyberdyne Systems was destroyed in the second movie, along with all traces of the terminator. This should have prevented the war. OK, so it never, it only postponed it. *(Spoiler alert) Skynet turns out to be a virus, that becomes self aware, and will construct the terminator (Cyberdyne Systems model 101) based on what? Huh? Military records? How did they get them if Cyberdyne systems was destroyed? Even if Skynet developed this model of the terminator through some kind of cybernetic evolution, he still wouldn't have been developed in the short amount of time they gave in the movie."

This one just tries to rattle off alittle connection from the first two in a 5 minute sequence then off to the rampage. It wasn't entertaining in the least bit, and critics who are fans of the first 2, just ripped this movie to shreds and Cameron to shreds for failing to notify the masses that this movie would be cheesy and essentially a plot spoof of the first two.

OK, the Skynet thingy wasn't a strong point to begin with, but what's all this pseudo-deep blah about the future and all. I mean, come on... a machine telling that 'Judgment Day' (what has this religious term to do with it all?) is 'inevitable' really pushes the envelope too much. A machine would be programmed to say what it says. It cannot 'know' what will happen, not calculate the future (chaos theory anyone ?). Far less in a situation where things depend so much on human decisions. So, what does the movie want to say ? Well, nothing. There is absolutely nothing. Watch out, machines *will* take over ? I think this movie really sends out a very bad message to kids. 'The future will be catastrophic, it can simply be computed and there's nothing we can do about it, so don't even think about trying to change stuff. Things are just gonna happen. It's well known that some of the ultra-conservative groups in the US see some sort of mass-dying as unavoidable. This kind of movies serve to condition audiences to accept this.

","After the excellent Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, we have a trilogy now, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But unfortunately, the third installment couldn't live up to my expectations after the first two genuine pieces of cinema.<br/><br/>In the first part, Arnold was the menacing, unstoppable and relentless killing machine. In the second, Arnold was a protagonist. It's a very good idea from Cameron. Let's see if he can make a good performance on the good side. And he could!<br/><br/>What we get from the third movie is having Arnold again as a protagonist, even the same model which he was in T2. Nothing new... But at least it's nice to see him again in his best role.<br/><br/>The antagonist is now a female terminator (it's just me, or the name ""Terminatrix"" is really cheesy?), which is a good idea. Or at least something new. Kristanna Loken is indeed beautiful and her performance is good - but sadly just ""good"", and not ""awesome"" or ""genuine"" as Robert Patrick's in T2. RP was waaaay better.<br/><br/>The story was written in a ""Come on guys, we HAVE to figure out something to make a new Terminator movie"" way. Judgment Day was only delayed? Give me a break! This destroys the whole story of T2, and doesn't offer anything in order to justify this act. So this is rather pointless.<br/><br/>The characters are much worse than they were in the previous movies. Kyle Reese was a totally understandable character, someone that the viewer could care about and he was played by Michael Biehn. Sarah Connor was also a character like this in the second - and they killed off her in this. So, we have a new character, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), who seems like a ripoff of Sarah. She merges the SC from the first with the SC from the second installment. Nice performance from Danes, but this isn't enough to make the movie good. We have of course John Connor - but the character is completely out of place.<br/><br/>The action sequences were breathtaking in the first and especially in the second movie (T2 has the most breathtaking CGI I've ever seen). Now, we've got a car chase with a giant truck (does anybody have déja vu?), lots of bullets, some wrestling and giant explosions. It was done before, nothing new! Only the ""hook into the manhole"" scene was memorable (the CGI used in that scene was made by hungarians!), but the other parts of the car chase were simply boring. What do we see? Shaking camera, cars going off-road, and this goes on for minutes... The car chase scene in The Matrix Reloaded is way better than this one. The wrestling between the two Terminators were good, however the Burly Brawl in M:R is better - moreover, it's slightly disturbing to see Arnold constantly beating a girl...<br/><br/>All in all the movie deserves a 7, because it's entertaining and fun to watch Arnold again (I liked the gay glasses scene...). But apart from this, it's mindless and not even visually adequate enough.<br/><br/>I'm not counting ""T3: Rise of the Machines"" as a Terminator movie. The Terminator saga ends with the closing sequence of ""T2: Judgment Day"" for me."

","I love Terminator 2, possibly even more than the original. I admire the way it skillfully creates the idea of the unstoppable machine (the liquid-metal T-1000) mindlessly and tirelessly on the trail of our heroes. The action scenes are world class and the effects, revolutionary in their day, are still pretty impressive. There are some pretty big faults, demonstrated by the poor attempts at humour and personified in the role of John Connor (Edward Furlong), but as a piece of movie making it is a good benchmark. Much of T2 involves the characters trying to avert a war against intelligent machines, which is due to start in 1997. I'm sure I won't be giving away too much when I say that they succeed in preventing the war. The end.<br/><br/>So, why a third installment? Well, the rules of Hollywood accountancy dictate that, since T2 made so much money and since Arnie didn't object, even averted wars can get started up again.<br/><br/>In T3 we meet up with John Connor again, now in his 20's and living ""off the grid"". It seems he didn't trust that the machine threat was completely gone, so he is drifting around, using assumed names and doing his best not to appear in any databases. So when the inevitable happens and a new terminator is sent to kill him (along with a now-obligatory ""friendly"" terminator to protect him) its first mission is to track down and kill all the people who <strong>will</strong> help him in the future. His future lieutenants, as it were. In doing this, the new Terminator stumbles on John's trail and the chase begins.<br/><br/>This is not a James Cameron film (the other two were, and so was the 3D short which you can only see at Universal Studios) but he did contribute to the script. I wonder how much input he really had though, because it definitely lacks the Cameron sheen you expect from his own projects. It's just not as tight.<br/><br/>The new terminator is a female robot, with some of the abilities of the previous liquid killer but the new twist is that this one can form itself into a variety of high-powered weapons. Whereas Robert Patrick's T-1000 was limited to shaping himself into knives and sharp spikes in order to kill the Connors, the new T-X can whip out a souped-up plasma rifle which could blast a rhino in half. So, all the powers of the last one, plus some extra makes for a much more interesting character, right?<br/><br/>Not really. The T-X is not as engaging as the T-1000. Robert Patrick's character had oodles more menace than pretty girl Kristanna Loken. I remember being shocked the first time I saw bullets splat big holes in his liquid body, then watched the holes mysteriously close. The same thing happens again here, but it's a case of ""yeah, we had that 13 years ago. What's new?""<br/><br/>Well, there's the certificate for starters. T2 was a 15, this is a 12. There's more humour too, unfortunately. Too often the movie tries to get laughs from Arnie's grim cyborg saying lines you wouldn't expect from a killing-machine. Like ""talk to the hand"". Har-bloody-har. Again, we had that 13 years ago and it was cack even then.<br/><br/>There is a nice destructive car chase and the action is well paced, but in the end it all seems rather pointless. Our only hope is that Arnie becomes so embroiled in politics that he can't find the time for another one.<br/><br/>I'll give it 5 out of 10."

John Connor is a whiny drifter, reduced to stealing meds from a pet hospital, beaten up by a woman, and unable to escape from a simple dog cage. What happened to the middle-schooler who broke into Cyberdyne, taught a killing machine the value of human life, and actually looked the part of a future resistance leader?<br/><br/>The villainess of the piece, T-something-or-other, is a clone of the liquid metal bad guy from T2. Only dumber, and with some implausible new skills, like the ability to change cup sizes.<br/><br/>There are plot holes and inconsistencies all over the place. For example, they explain that the Ah-Nold character in this movie doesn't know what the Terminator from T2 knew because it's a different unit. But it still goes out of its way not to kill anyone, as in T2. <br/><br/>And if you can believe it, John Connor's biography and the history of the future become even more confusing. Worse than that, there's a revelation that will make you wonder why any of the characters even bother.<br/><br/>Having thoroughly established that T3 doesn't live up to its predecessors, let me say it isn't all bad. The major action scenes are comparable to those from T1 or T2. The Governor of California once again plays the machine in his mechanical, but oddly likable way. I can't find fault with any of the actor's performances; they do the best they can.<br/><br/>Another reviewer said that T3 should not be considered ""canon."" If you care about such things, you won't like T3. But if you can accept the film's limitations, and overlook the bad attempts at humor, it's a decent action movie. I gave it 6 out of 10."

","The third (and final???) installment in the Terminator trilogy brings events rate up to date and sees the birth of Skynet and the story of judgment day, and the efforts to prevent it. <br/><br/>Without James Cameron the film lacks the finesse and tghtness of the first two films, it doesn't have the same feel, and it lacks Cameron's guiding hand. Luckily Big Arnie is on top form giving one of his better performances, probably his best film since True Lies, returning in same same role, albeit as a different Terminator unit from the same series model. This time the enemy is the immensely brutal and advanced T-X, played superbly by Kristianna Loken, who manages to combine sultry seductiveness with ruthless brutal killing seemingly effortlessly.<br/><br/>Claire Danes, who does a fine job as Kate Brewster, a vetinary nurse who is unfortunately drawn into the war against the machines, and her performance is first rate. <br/><br/>The script is nice, it has a few holes in it but mostly holds together OK, there are a few nice twists, especially the history of Arnie's Terminator, and the rise of Skynet is very nicely explained with a very good showing of 'American generals and politicians as morons' - watch it you'll like it.<br/><br/>The let down of the film for me is Nick Stahl as John Conner, who gives an average performance and fails to bring much energy and depth to the character who had great potential and was played expertly by Edward Furlong in T2. In T3 Conner is a lost and selfish character hiding from nothing but himself, and there is no way to connect this John Conner with the young Conner in T2, or the resistance leader he was to become. Eddie's young Conner had a brash rebellious nature and you could see how Conner could become the leader of the human resistance to the machines, but Nick Stahl's portrayal just falls flat and doesn't impress. A nice cameo from the ever brilliant Earl Boen as Dr Silberman makes a nice comedy moment, and the sporadic light comic relief from Arnie makes the film more bearable. A shame that Linda Hamilton didn't wasn't in the film, though the character is included to make a good comedy and quintisentially Sarah Conner moment.<br/><br/>Overall T3 is good, it doesn't have the same impact that the original film had, nor the dynamic fast paced story of T2. The film suffers from 'third in trilogy syndrome', where all the best ideas have been put into the first two and the third film is just trying to grind out the idea (see Aliens 3, Police Academy 3 onwards, etc) but everything is saved by Arnie's brilliant performance as the Terminator. <br/><br/>Final statements - as a member of the Terminator series, it isn't as good as the first two. Had the first two never been made, or perhaps if this was the second film, not the third, it could have been called great. Its very good if viewed as a separate film, merely good when considered in the trilogy. Will there be a T4 when Arnie finishes his term as governor Terminator? Anything is possible, but judging from T3, somehow someway James Cameron will need to be convinced to work on the project. T1 gets 8 out of ten, T2 gets nine, T3 gets a grudging 7."

","Terminator 2 certainly didn't open it self up for another Terminator but 11 years later the series continues. This new chapter is no longer directed by infamous James Cameron, when i heard this i had doubts that this film would be any good. It was now taken over by Jonathan Mostow director of Submarine movie U571 which i hated. So my hopes for this movie where shot. Other things i heard about this movie were that Edward Furlong was no longer attached to this movie which really blew my mind. Who could replace him? I also heard Linda Hamilton was no longer apart of this project which also upset me, but later was corrected. The rival terminator was a female, which kind of threw the terminator off balance but also was different. WARNING SPOILERS: We begin like all the other movies in a future war torn earth where John Connor and others of the human race are fighting for their lives against the machines. Brilliant Opening sequence by the way. We come to present day where John Connor is 20 years old, living off the grid no residence and no legal tender for fear of others trying to kill him. Then we get to the new female terminator played by the sexy Kristanna Lokan. The audience is treated to some nice T&A or the guys are i might add. Then the arrival of the Arnie! , its amazing how this guy looks the same as he did 11 years ago. Same muscle structure and same build. Then the movie takes off and a good pace and good directing. Great action throughout. To fix up and plot holes, this story is almost the same Two Terminators sent back through time one to kill one to protect John Connor played by Nick Stahl, but also there's a new twist. The female ""Terminatrix"" is sent to kill John's Lutinents since John could not be found and also kill his spouse Catherine Brewster played by pretty Claire Danes. It also reveals how cyberdines project sky net was not destroyed because Catherines father is in charge of the project which is almost complete. The terminator no longer listens to John's commands, but only Catherines. In this film, it starts the War with the machines, thus the title rise of the machines. John realizes that he is no longer going to fight to stop it but go along with his destiny. Also Sara Connor is no longer living she was died from a disease. The end scene is a beautifully tragic in way we don't see a billion people getting blown up. Deff a good addition to the Terminator series. Opening itself up for T4 the future war. Hopefully Arnold will take part in the next series."

","From the first few seconds of the film, T3 trod the same old ground. Starting with the T's arriving in the ""burning bubbles"" and continuing on through the overly-long car chases until the dreary ending, this film was almost a clip show of scenes from T2. Worse yet, parts of it were even a parody of the earlier films...for example, the Elton-Johnesque sunglasses Arnold ""borrows"" from the male stripper. I was bored and dissatisfied with this movie and it came very close to besmirching the memory of the much better earlier films. The female T3 was predictable, and not nearly the shocker it was supposed to be. I think they should have tried an entirely new direction with this movie, but it falls flat and I rank it completely out of the same league as T2."

","The movie isn't made by Cameron thus, I cannot recognize it as true Terminator canon. Cameron was the visionary behind the earlier pictures, he also spoke of a third movie in the mid nineties. I dunno why he's not involved in this one but it shows. Terminator 2 beats this in about every single aspect, T2 had spirit, it awoke emotion and was full of powerful storytelling. T3 is just full of excuses to flash arnie around and blow stuff up. Arnies face mask is a botch job and the computerized effects gleam off plastic-like. The effects are total crap compared to the work done in T2 which even today look spectacular whilst here the effects look flat and unimpressive. Cameron knows storytelling, writing, effects AND individual cast directing, he is a director genius and the Terminator saga pretty much his brainchild, without him and his original Terminator team (including the cast) a Terminator movie is nothing but a meaningless summer action flick. T1 and T2 ruled because they were action films that were also good movies, not just an endless flood of dropping shells and bullets like raindrops..."

","Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as Terminator<br/><br/>Over the holidays, I had the pleasure of watching Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines. It is an action packed film staring (The Governor of California) Arnold Schwarzenegger, who plays the Terminator, Nick Stahl as John Connor, Kristana Lokan as T-X and Clair Danes as Kate Brewster.<br/><br/>The film starts out with John Connor who has erased his identity and tries to hide his existence, in fear of being found by another terminator, after the death of his mother Sarah Connor. One day he runs into Kate Brewster who is also going to play an important role in the future of the human beings. After a little while, they're being chased by two terminators. A T-X (played by Kristanna Loken) and a T-800 (the Terminator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger). The T-X is sent to kill a number of people, including Connor and Brewster, and the T-800 is sent to protect the two of them. Suddenly they find themselves fighting against time, to save the humanity from a nuclear war. John and Sarah's objective is to shut down 'Sky Net' which is a high-tech computer system in charge of the worlds Nuclear weapons before time is up.<br/><br/>This film is made to look exceptionally futuristic; I think it links in quite a few ways to I.T firstly by having the country's defense system running through artificial intelligence, how T-X was able to hack into the five police cars CPU and control them all simultaneously, and how T-X reprogrammed Terminator to kill John Connor and Kate Brewster.<br/><br/>All in all, T3 is a benchmark for 21st century action movies.<br/><br/>I'll be back."

When the end of the world becomes inevitable the T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back to the past to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) and his bride to be Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) who happens to be the daughter of the head of the nation's computer defense system which system is trying to get rid of a malicious computer virus with its flawed Skynet program.

The couple is chased by T-X (Kristanna Loken) - an extremly beautiful lady who was sent from the future to ignite judgement day. Since there is zero chance of slighting a worldwide attack by machines Arnie chooses to bust jokes and shop wisely at am-pm for Waner Wafers (an austrian speciality) while he is fulfilling his command to protect future leader of the warfare against the machines. Disappointingly to say, but Arnie's fighting scenes with the T-X are for nothing. Eyecatching, but useless for the plot. This time the Terminator does not really have a mission. He is not trying to save the world but trying to extend its existence. Whereas T-X, by the way her real name is Terminatrix, is trying to speed things up.<br/><br/>Oh well, the cast is stunning, especially Kristanna Loken, the special effect awesome, the plot ok, the ending sad, and another Trilogy made in Hollywood is complete.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

"Victor Field","Null","0","0","27 June 2004"," The first and second times were the charm.
","Third movies, eh? Not all of them are doomed to be letdowns; ""Escape from the Planet of the Apes"" was the best of the series after the original, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" was the best of the sequels (and, probably not coincidentally, one of the few that Wes Craven had any creative input on), and for the ultimate example of there being exceptions to the rule, look no further than ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King."" And then there's ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.""<br/><br/>The first two ""Terminator"" movies had James Cameron behind them; this one has Jonathan Mostow. Now there's nothing wrong with the boy Mostow  ""Breakdown"" proved he can pull off cracking thrillers, and he certainly delivers on the action front here, but the ""Terminator"" series was always about more than knock-em-dead action. While he and writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris obey that manifesto here, it's in a different and not necessarily better way for two main reasons; one is that the focus of this movie is more on John Connor here than on John Connor and the Terminator. In the first movie the Terminator and Sarah Connor were equals (sorry, Kyle Reese fans); in the second movie saw them almost as a family unit. This time, it's more about the troubled and older John than the machines, which sounds good in a way, but it just helps add to the general grim, defeatist air throughout the movie. Given that this movie is essentially the ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" of the series, bringing everything full circle, it couldn't really be any other way  but it would make the movie almost a deadening experience were it not for the reason most people choose to see this movie, i.e. the action scenes.<br/><br/>Which brings us to reason numero two-o; the writers spend a lot of time playing riffs on the first two movies, with the big chase scene featuring the Terminator on a motorbike chasing a big rig commandeered by the evil Terminator that's chasing our human hero in a smaller vehicle especially amped up here (and with the nice addition of the evil Terminator remote-controlling several other cars to help out in pursuit), and it would work a lot better if it wasn't just a bigger, brawnier relative of a similar moment in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" (And we don't get ""I'll be back""  but we do get ""She'll be back"" and ""I'm back."") Arnold  no last name needed  is still fine when not required to act too much, and as T-X, the cutest cybernetic killing machine you ever did see, Kristanna Loken is effective and much easier on the eyes than Robert Patrick (though not quite as creepy); good effects help, but Marco Beltrami's score doesn't go with the mayhem as well as Brad Fiedel's did for the first two movies, even though it's more listenable away from the visuals than Fiedel's is. (The best track in the movie is Jerry Goldsmith's music for the C2 Pictures logo.)<br/><br/>But Nick Stahl as John Connor is no match for Edward Furlong last time out, or the rest of the cast here; his performance underlines the movie's unbalanced priorities  when the obsolete Terminator and the super-advanced T-X face off, it's hard not to think this should be the real climax of the movie rather than the finale we actually get. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is the ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" of the series; some good ideas, nice fidelity to the rest of the series - especially in a moment when John realises that this Terminator isn't the same model that visited him in 1991 - and certainly not a bad movie, but ultimately something of a weak little sister. (And is it really asking so much for a movie in which Claire Danes isn't a misery magnet?)"

","I'm surprised that Arnold even bothered to participate in another sequel without James Cameron as director. It was James Cameron wrote and directed both the first and second Terminator movies. Both movies were classics.<br/><br/>The main problem is that Jonathan Mostow, director of this movie, fails miserably to imitate the genius style of James Cameron. T3 is littered with bad music, cliché dialog, and terrible editing and cinematography. Mostow is about as mediocre of a director as one can be.<br/><br/>Honestly, this movie should have never been made. The Terminator series has been spoiled. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the special effects were good and that Kristanna Loken looked absolutely gorgeous.<br/><br/>But that's the problem. The main focus of attention was the special effects and Loken.

Actually the only big difference to it's two predecessors is that the film's not even nearly as dark as Cameron's movies. It is a bit of a problem, since T1 and T2 were perfect borderline horror movies. Especially the original. T3 doesn't take itself as seriously which maybe would've been nice. That said, I must also state that this movie is not bad as a lighthearter Terminator film. It does play with the same serious issues as the originals and the suspense is very well build this time around too. If I'd be asked weather I would recommend this film, the answer would certainly be yes. Arnold is back to doing what he does best, Stahl and Danes are good in the supporting roles and Loken kicks a** as the T-X. Plus there's that groovy chase sequence which is every bit as admirable as the truck chase in T2.<br/><br/>**** ½ / *****"

"Andyboy_17","7","0","0","12 May 2004"," It has the Action and entertainment, but lacks the originality and intelligence
","To follow up a great film like ""Terminator 2 - Judgment Day"" (1991), which is probably the best Action-film I've ever seen, is not easy.  To be honest...it's nearly impossible. Especially if your name is Jonathan Mostow and not James Cameron.  Cameron is one of the best Action-directors ever, with high quality, brilliant and intelligent Action/Science Fiction-films like ""The Abyss"" (1989), ""Aliens"" (1986), ""The Terminator"" (1984) and the mentioned ""Terminator 2"" under his belt.  When I first heard that James Cameron was not going to be involved in ""Terminator 3 - The Rise Of The Machines"", I knew that it wasn't going to be a film at the level of it's prequels.  And after I saw the first trailers, I prepared myself for an almost mindless Action-film, yet an entertaining one (I'm a huge fan of the whole Terminator concept, so that's enough to satisfy me) that was going to do it's best to overwhelm the fantastic Action-sequences of the two other films. Last summer, when I went to the cinema and watched it for the first time, that's almost what i got....<br/><br/>John Connor has erased his identity and tries to hide his existence, in fear of being find by another terminator, after the death of his mother Sarah Connor.  One day he runs into Kate Brewster who is also going to play an important role in the future of the human beings.  After a little while, they're being chased by two terminators.  A T-X (played by Kristanna Loken) and a T-800 (the Terminator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger).  The T-X is sent to kill a number of people, including Connor and Brewster, and the T-800 is sent to protect the two of them. Suddenly they find themselves fighting against time, to save the humanity from a nuclear war.<br/><br/>That's the story of the film...simple as that.  But this story definitely provides almost two hours of good entertainment and ""non-stop"" Action. Because this is the kind of film you can really describe with the mark Non-Stop Action.  I've heard that this movie is the most expensive ever made.  And after watching the breathtaking Action and Special Effects of this film, I won't doubt that.  The ones who loved the first Terminator-films only for the Action-scenes, shouldn't be disappointed. But the ones who also loved the fascinating and originality of the characters and the whole story and concept, is surely to be (at least) a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>This is a much more simple movie, compared to it's prequels, and the Action and the Special Effects has to carry the film on it's own.  The prequels had some good character-development and good dialogs to put us deep into the brilliance of the story.  This film lacks both.  Character-development is almost completely absent.  And poor performances by Clair Danes and Nick Stahl doesn't make it any better.  They should have gotten Edward Furlong to play John Connor, just like he did in the last film.  And the dialogs are minimal too.  Much of the dialogs are just silly and doesn't grab me the same way as they did especially in ""Terminator 2"".  Even though it has the most simple story of the three films, there's no doubt that this film could have been as good as the two others, only if they would have done it in a better way.  I can see the potential just from watching the beginning and the end of the film.<br/><br/>But the film is definitely not going downhill all the way.  Kristanna Loken is not only a EXTREEEMLY beautiful and sexy woman, but she sure is doing a good job playing the T-X.  She really have that robot-look all over her face and body when she moves and talks, and she's almost as frightening as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in ""Terminator 2"".  And Mr. Schwarzenegger...what can I say? He IS the Terminator.  He was born to play a machine from the future, and he is just as good as he was in the other films.  As mentioned before, this film has the impressive Action from it's prequels, so it's really giving me the right Terminator-feeling.  It also has the humor we saw in ""Terminator 2"", and this time it's even more of it.  So people are guaranteed to be entertained.<br/><br/>Over all....I pretty much got what I expected from this film. ""Terminator 3 - The Rise Of The Machines"" has the trademark Terminator-Action and entertainment, but it lacks the originality and the fascinating intelligence of the other Terminator-films.  I know there's a ""Terminator 4"" on the way, which I doubt would be any better than this one.  But one can always keep a little hope that the film will be a worthy conclusion to(in my opinion) the best series of Action-movies in film-history.  Until then...just grab a bucket of popcorn and enjoy these two hours of wild, high tech Robot-Action.<br/><br/>

","T3, ""Rise of the Machines"" is for me that rarest of films - one that I like less with each viewing. That's not to say that it is without redeeming features - it has for example one of the most breathtaking vehicle sequences I can remember seeing - but the writing is generally more like poor fan fiction than a genuine third installment in the series.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW<br/><br/>On the whole I don't obsess over details between franchise movies, but the abandonment of ""no fate but what we make"" in favour of an inevitable Judgement Day counts as something more than a detail. John Connor's newfound fatalism is neither particularly believable in view of his history - after all, he *knows* that JD can at least be successfully postponed - nor is it necessary to the plot, since the core of that was lifted straight from its predecessor anyway. This isn't a new movie, so much as a bad case of ""well if *I'd* written T2, *I'd* have done it this way"". The relentless series of joky back references don't help either, in a film that seems unable to decide whether it wants to be homage, parody or a new perspective on the Terminator story.<br/><br/>Once you start to dislike a movie, the plot holes start to annoy you out of all proportion. How does the T-X's ability to manipulate other computers translate to an ability to remotely control vehicles' steering and transmission? Why was the facility that Kate Brewster's father worked out of on such secure military projects, completely unguarded? Why did he have a private plane there? What happened to the laws of motion (particularly the bit about ""equal and opposite reaction"") during the cartoonish battle of the Terminators in the washroom? What inspired Connor to fire up the 'particle accelerator' and above all, how the hell did he know how to? How come the T-X, which was so badly affected by the (rather disturbing) external magnetic field from the accelerator that her metal was being stripped from her frame was able to wrench an arm away, form an apparently motorised (i.e. magnetic field dependent) saw with a small blade and damage the accelerator enough to escape? Why was an emergency bunker, apparently designed to protect the most senior members of government in the event of war, fully powered up but completely unmanned? How does Arnie manage to restrain the more powerful T-X with both his fuel cells removed? Eventually you start to ask ""why did I just spend the last 100 minutes of my life watching this stuff?""<br/><br/>The answer is, just so long as you can disengage your brain and watch it for the spectacle, it's a pretty slick show. There's chases and explosions and a cute, blonde and decidedly female villain and just occasionally those back references are amusing. And at least it avoids the problems of franchises like Robocop, where the main character went from virtually indestructible supercyborg in the first movie to spending more time being repaired than fighting crime in the third. These terminators are still determinedly solid killing machines, even if the film does seem to think it has more to say than is really the case."

That is, not only should it be faithful to the previous film(s) in story, but in style, theme, innovation, intelligence, etc.<br/><br/>*spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>Terminator 3 seems to miss these points and comes out as basically a dumbed-down remake of Terminator 2. The plot is virtually the same: a shape-shifting robot comes through time to kill John Connor and ""The Arnold"" model is sent back to protect him. Can you say ""seen this before""?<br/><br/>I don't know who was responsible for the design of the T-X, Mostow or Winston, but I gotta ask: why? Who in their right mind would think that if you stick a glowing endoskeleton inside a T-1000, you'd get a more efficient killing machine? What, pray tell, does the endoskeleton contribute? The T-X can't do half the stuff the T-1K did: melt into floors, walk through barred gates, fly into a million pieces and then reassemble. But man, oh man, how are we to destroy this ""deadlier"" model? Oh, wait, it was as simple as blowing it up! Kudos on the creativity there. So in the end, the T-X met a death that would only delay the T-1K.<br/><br/>It's things like this that insult the true fans of the Terminator films. Whereas T1 and T2 were fact-based science fiction, T3 steps over into live acton comic book world. The T-X can change her robotic arm to become a plasma cannon, a flamethrower, a pizza cutter for god's sake! What is this, Transformers? Or the 60's Batman where he's got a convenient tool for every occasion?<br/><br/>In another brilliant scene, the T-X transforms her finger into a long needle, injecting several police cars with some kind of electronic signal (or magic potion) that makes the cars obey her every whim. I know Mostow's not a complete idiot and knows that to control a normal car you need to turn the steering wheel, push the pedals, shift the gears MANUALLY (it's a mechanical process). So the only conclusion I can make is that he considers the average audience too dumb to actually know that. Sadly, maybe he's right. But many fans of the Terminator movies are drawn to it because of the films' intelligence. And that intelligence has always come from Jim Cameron. His design for the Terminator endoskeleton was credible: the joints, the muscles, the eyes; you could sit there and actually believe that such a machine could move, climb, simulate a human. Moreover, you could believe that when covered with flesh, such a machine could techincally exist.<br/><br/>But in T3, this same Terminator can get its head chopped off, left connected only by wires and then somehow stick it back onto its body like Frankenstein and move it around in subsequent scenes as if nothing happened. In T3, the T-X can remotely control a car. (But if she can do that, she might as well be able to remotely control a pair of scissors, a bike, or a pistol.)<br/><br/>Moreover, if Mostow really was as great of a Terminator fan as he claimed to be, he would not have screwed up such details that an Arnold is a T-800 model 101 (not a T-850, not a T-101). Moreover, he would have studied what it really was that made the first two films great, and that was intelligence and ingenuity, not just explosions, chases scenes, and comic book robots with superpowers."

","When I first heard T3 would hit screens, I was expecting it to be of same quality as previous ones, cause I really liked the first two Terminators. Then I heard Cameron wasn't signed to do it. And when I arrived to the cinema and the movie started, I realised my worst fears were true.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>Movie started off with horrible voice-over, which explained the situation, so instead of revealing the story bit by bit with mystery factor (like previous ones), it was spat on our face, ready for mindless action. I actually regret paying so much money for seeing this movie. Action was well done, but that doesn't excuse the lack of story, which seemed to be there only to connect all the pointless actionscenes. It seemed like a spoof of first two installments. Although I liked Arnies performance, Nick Stahl and Claire Danes were pretty bad. They didn't connect at all and the part where Kate finds out her fiancee has been killed is really really bad. But don't worry - she'll laugh at it with John in a couple of minutes.<br/><br/>NO MORE SPOILERS<br/><br/>Only pleasant surprise was the ending (which I'm not gonna spoil for you). Oh yeah... and T-X is pretty hot ;) Rent it and watch it with friends after a couple of beers. Don't expect it to be as good as previous ones. Good sci-fi has been sucked out of it.<br/><br/>
My rating - 3/10 (only for seeing Kristanna Loken nude from behind)."

","*** MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>
I was utterly disappointed with T3. Ok, I'm not a fan of Hollywood, and I pity those who are. But T2 was still special, and Arnold is more than just an actor to me, he's more like a god. But this flick.. If I were Arnold, I would break down and cry upon such a disappointing sequel to his T2, which happens to be one of the best sci-fi flicks of all times.<br/><br/>
I think IMDB should add ""comedy"" to the list of genres for this movie. There are some scenes that are typicals of a successful comedy, and there are such amateur, impaired, and purely f***ed up scenes that try to be serious, but just make you laugh your ass off. Maybe a sci-fi flick cannot and moreover shouldn't explain everything in a logical way, but even that wouldn't make me forgive the huge error in this movie: Robots give humanly reactions and face gestures! WTF?!?! And the story is getting weaker and weaker.. I think if they try to make a T4, it'll be pure comedy. So I hope they don't try that, for the sake of not insulting the first 2 movies anymore.<br/><br/>
Other than that, the things humans say, and the way Terminator answers them is simply hillarious! The dialogues, the questions and answers.. Everything!<br/><br/>Claire Danes: Go to hell you asshole! - Terminator  : Unable to comply.<br/><br/>Terminator appears out of the void and saves the heroes' lives among all the explosions and stuff, and says: I'm back. (Oh really? Are you? I thought you were front.. Blah!)<br/><br/>How Terminator catches bullets with his teeth, how Kristianna enlarges her boobs (which I'd like to see in another setting *evil grin*) Give me a break! Those are too cheap even for a Hollywood flick!<br/><br/>
Briefly, I couldn't stop laughing from the first minute of this movie until the last. And it doesn't offer much other than making you laugh in tears, so it qualifies as a perfect comedy. I had the feeling it would be disappointing like this, so I hesitated to watch it. But I couldn't bear the push, and rented the DVD. Do yourself a favour, and DO BEAR that push! Especially if you've seen T2 and liked it, avoid this one. Everything about this movie is just an insult to T1 and T2.<br/><br/>A generous 6/10 for T3, and that's for the comedy part ;-)"
"oneflewovertheapocalypse","Null","0","0","9 April 2004"," Not so much an Epic!
","Just to think what Terminator 3 could have been.  It's a good film but it's not the epic that I wanted and not the epic we expected.    When looking back at the first two Terminator's the story for The Rise of the Machines is there for the taking and could have been the best 3rd film of a trilogy ever to be made.   What was the first problem was Jonathan Mostow.  He has made good films in the past and is a good director but to put the helm in his hands to make a film that had to be better than one of the greatest sequels ever made was very risky and extremely stupid.   Only one man could have made T3 the epic it deserved to be and that's James Cameron. <br/><br/>
I was really surprised he even let the movie go ahead because he must have some say over it as he created the characters in the first place.   As far as Arnie goes he was as good as ever in his return as The Terminator.    I thought the TX played by Kristanna Loken was alright but she didn't put the fear in you like Arnie did with the original and Robert Patrick did with T2. I think they now know that putting a girl in as the new terminator was a different and interesting idea but when watching it back now it looks all a bit silly really and stupid from the word off.   I am not being sexist saying that no girl could be a bad ass TX or something, just not her.   The most positive thing to come out of the film is Nick Stahl as John Connor. He is brilliant as Connor and makes you thank Mostow for not keeping with Edward Furlong in the first place.  <br/><br/>What I didn't like was how long it was on for.   For a film about a war between the machines and man you have to lengthen the story and it's characters.   If this was a warm up film to what is about to come then that is fair enough but I can't see how another Terminator will get made now Arnie is the Governor of California and his run will go well into his early sixties.  It all depends on whether he is feeling like Harrison Ford and ready to jump into any film whether it will be action or drama.   If T3 is the closure of the story then it ends on a sour point.   I thought of many other ways they can carry it on without him but whether that would work remains to be seen.<br/><br/>Would they continue the story without Arnie and the more important thing would it be any good?   Even though Arnie is not the best of actors anyway his presence in the trilogy is one of the most important in any film ever made and that is important.   The way T3 ends is one of the most original and emotional endings I have ever seen and the more I think about the more it makes you look at how different Mostow and Cameron are as directors because I don't think Cameron would have ended it that way.  That's where I love what Mostow did with the end of T3 but I still think it should be James Cameron behind the camera.   If they both written the film and Cameron directed then we would have had the best of both worlds but it's not like that and future is still not written as far as The Terminator goes and neither is anything else."

","T3's plot is basically T2's without Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, Edward Furlong as John Connor and in place of Robert Patrick's T-1000 is the new female Terminator played by the beautiful blond, blue eyed Kristanna Loken.<br/><br/>John Connor is now a young adult played by Nick Stahl (the little kid from ""Man Without A Face"" all grown up and now resembling a young Paul Newman). Sarah's dead and John's a drifter who just wanders around because he's still afraid that a Terminator might come knocking on his door if he sets down roots anywhere. That's when the lady Terminator shows up stark naked, kills a woman and steals her clothes and goes around killing a few of John's future 2nd in commands and then tries to kill both John and his future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), who was a mild associate of his when they were kids. That's when Arnold's Terminator shows up to save the day. Did I mention Kate's dad is a general continuing the Skynet project? Well, basically the whole ""you can change your destiny"" moral from T2 is smashed into the ground in favor of the ""destiny is set"" moral because Skynet takes over and destroys the world anyway, thanks to the Internet. But John & Kate survive to lead the resistance.<br/><br/>Now this isn't a bad film necessarily, but then again, neither was ""Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom"". Like that 2nd Indiana Jones feature, T3 doesn't even come close to being the classic that the first two entries were. Arnold's still fun to watch as the Terminator, Nick Stahl is a more sympathetic John Connor than Edward Furlong could ever have hoped to be, Claire Danes is alright but no Linda Hamilton and Kristanna Loken does the stoic female Terminator bit as well as any other actress can, but ultimately the film is hollow, cheesy and pointless. Despite Loken's efforts, she's never as creepy as the T-1000, and not just because she's a beautiful woman who leads the men in the audience to fantasizing about her (and I've seen some pretty creepy women in cinema in my time). The action scenes are executed competently enough but they lack the slickness of T2 and the raw power of the T1.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the only reasons for this film being made were to work the Internet into the Terminator mythology and to get a tall, beautiful blond woman Terminator naked to satisfy all the fan boys who wanted a naked Terminator woman. Well, those fantasies are fulfilled early in the film, when Kristanna makes the classic entrance and starts walking around completely naked, but most annoyingly her magnificent 5'11"" figure is kept in the shadows for the most, which isn't fair considering that the original film and this film throw Arnold's butt right in our faces, something no one ever wanted to see except maybe his own wife, Maria. You'll have to look closely to see her derriere just before she kills her first victim. And like all women, Kristanna looks better with her hair down.<br/><br/>You know what a more interesting film would have been? Setting the film in the actual future and focusing on the beginning of the Terminators then. Arnold could have played a soldier who is killed by the machines and later his body is used as a model for the other Terminators to follow in as the mold."
"cjsdragon","Null","0","0","3 April 2004"," A disappointing sequel to a popular story
","The first Terminator film to be made without the guidance and vision of James Cameron, and it certainly suffers as a result.  Novice director Jonathan Mostow is way out of his depth and makes the classic mistake of all forgettable sci-fi films, he focuses on the special effects and action sequences and completely ignores the story.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the special effects and action sequences are awesome to watch, but hardly compensate for a very sparse story line.  As a result, the film is unbalanced and lacks the emotional core of T1 and T2.  The heart of those films were the characters.  You wanted them to survive, you wanted them to triumph and you cared about what happened to them.  And that brings me to the other big problem with T3, Nick Stahl is appallingly miscast. His John Connor is a small, weedy looking guy with no on-screen presence, no charisma and a very limited acting ability.  He was irritating to watch and only served to highlight the superficial nature of the story.<br/><br/>Such a pity, because there were some genuinely good ideas that with a skilled director and better writers could have made for a truly memorable film."

","First off the positives this film has some of the most over the top action sequences ever.  Like or loathe this movie it will make you sit back and go wow!! every once in a while.  Also despite some of the negative comments i've seen Arnie doesn't do a bad job of reprising his role as the Terminator.<br/><br/>The main problems I found with this film is that you never really care weather the main protagonists get killed or not.  The whole movie feels like a re-hash of Terminator 2, the movie never stops moving and what interaction there is between the characters is normally conducted during a car chase.<br/><br/>
If they had added maybe 10mins to the runtime and introduced a couple of slower scenes I feel it would have helped the movie and made the wow! moments more effective.  There are some glaring plot inconsistancies between this Terminator 1 and T2 which have been discussed in detail elsewhere. But to be honest this film is not trying to be Citizen Caine, it's trying to be a big dumb action movie and in that respect it succeeds.<br/><br/>
Overall it's not a bad movie, but it's not great either.  It's perfect cinema or DVD rental popcorn fodder.  Sit back enjoy the action and don't think too hard and you'll get an enjoyable evenings entertainment, does what it set out to do and no more 6/10."

","I feel that had James Cameron been involved in this film, it would have been a different story altogether. I have always loved Mr. Cameron's work and I know that himself and Arnold Schwarzenegger make a good team. When I found out Mr. Cameron was not working on T3 I knew it wouldn't have the same 'feel' to it as T1 and T2 had. T1 had a scary / fearful-like sensation. T2 was the same, where by Sarah Connor, John Connor and the T-101 were running away from the T1000. Good storyline and plenty of plot and action. T3 as soon as it started u could feel it was not going to be the same. The past two Terminator movies started with a future image, the began showing the Terminator arriving. Then seeing the enemy. In this case we saw John Connor's life, the TX arrive cause a stir. The see the Terminator arrive, to then take part in a humorous plot.<br/><br/>I loved every minute of the movie because I was excited to see it. But in comparison to the last two, I was disappointed in the storyline / plot.<br/><br/>I sure hope there is a T4 or that James Cameron does a remake of T3. His way!"

","Terminator Three could have been way, way worse than it was. Considering the James Cameron had nothing to do with it, it was a reasonable effort. Not brilliant, but reasonable. It would take someone to really get into the mind of James Cameron to have a chance of continuing his efforts in his place, and as this wasn't done the universe of Mostow's film isn't too synchronous with the universe of Cameron's films. <br/><br/>Mostow isn't what could be called an all-round director, he's strong on action but weak on everything else especially comedy, although perhaps the writers need to shoulder some of the blame. The new Terminator wasn't too bad, it seemed like an advanced model over the T-1000, if nothing else. The only real question I have to ask is what was Arnie's obsession with sunglasses? (I did have a laugh when he put on the first pair of sunglasses though, about the only joke that didn't make me groan).<br/><br/>T3 didn't tarnish the name of Terminator films as much as Alien Resurrection tarnished the Alien films in my opinion. I hope a fourth Terminator isn't being planned as one extra one is enough, anything extra they make will end up being distributed in large numbers as part of future box sets."

","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS<br/><br/>
Nah, I'm only kidding, this second Terminator sequel isn't actually that bad to be honest. That said, I have only seen it the once, and can't imagine its thin-even-by-Terminator-standards plot really holding my attention a second time.<br/><br/>The original still holds its place as a quite impressive arthouse SF thriller in my opinion. Judgement Day? Well, it depends on how I view it - sometimes it's an overlong moronfest, others it's an exciting FX extravaganza and others it's a soulless, noisy popcorn machine. Certainly the day I posted my review of it to the IMDb I wasn't looking on favourably, though it's clearly superior to this pedestrian follow-up.<br/><br/>What plot T3 does have (and with its subtitle ""Rise of the Machines"" it could arguably be taken to court under the Trading Standards Agreement) seems to be dividing into two unequal halves. Remember those really corny episodes of Knight Rider (okay, all episodes of Knight Rider were really corny, but roll with me) where an evil KITT known as KARR would control Michael Knight's vehicle and turn it against him? Michael would have to stand there arguing with KITT's sense of reason? Even back in the days of David Hasselhoff's 80s perm that was dated, but here we have similar shenanigans with Arnie's battered T-101 under the control of the TX. The other, much larger, half comes directly from a straight rehash of Judgement Day.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this does get rather silly as it means that while the film delivers a reasonable twist, it does yet again contradict itself. The nuclear war will come... no it won't... yes it does. Though this development makes the phrase ""I am"" possibly the most predictable in cinema history, the nuclear explosions are made to look quite beautiful. Whether this is a good thing or not is open to debate, and maybe with a bit of post 9/11 angst this would have made the film feel relevant, rather than just an old relic trying to relive glory days.<br/><br/>Of course, the biggest problem making this an okay sequel instead of one you actually give a toss about is the TX. When a character is so rigidly defined by their sexuality as Kristanna Loken is, then it removes all tension. It's just not possible to be scared when your libido is being forced to work, and even by T2's standards there's an enormous amount of obvious humour, pushing it beyond parody at times. Okay, I did shame myself by laughing at the gay gag, but when it gets to the stage of the TX checking her reflection and squeezing Arnie's balls it's just gone too far. And with her superpowers there to attempt to top Robert Patrick's superb T-1000, we get silliness like her power over other machines and inflatable breasts. If the inevitable fourth film continues to build on this we'll soon have flying Terminators that can assume the form of small rodents.<br/><br/>An okayish script is often dumb, allowing for back-slapping cameos by Dr. Silberman, and a nauseating plane scene where Clare Danes contrivedly explains how she used to test fly her brother's. Generally though, while there's the traditional reams of exposition in between pointless explosions, this isn't so contrived, and even offers up intriguing possibilities with the foretold death of John Connor. Commendably, even the paradoxes inherent in the concept are addressed, with Connor (Nick Stahl, quite good) reasoning that their actions may make the T-101 cease to exist.<br/><br/>If I really wanted to be nit-picky I could cite the incredibly crude uses of product placement, but instead I'll just ask the question of what new does this sequel bring to the party? The answer is nothing. There is no real reason for this sequel to exist, though it is nice to see Arnie having another hit, when his lower-key successes of late have all been worthwhile (though The 6th Day was a stinker).<br/><br/>The lack of usage of the theme and that eerie android sound effect surprise, yet the FX are, naturally, technically the most proficient. However, Jonathan Mostow's leaden direction fails to work them in any innovative way (and why do the Terminators now arrive in a disco mirrorball?), meaning they fail to impress. Combine this with the fact that such effects are no longer groundbreaking, as they were for T2, and it's something of a let-down. Forward to 2004 and we now have Governor Schwarzenegger of California. Was this his half-hearted farewell?"
"bnl771","Null","0","0","4 March 2004"," The Machines Rise Indeed
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was a project that had nothing going for it. Without James Cameron behind the camera (or involved in any way at all), many thought the project was doomed from day one. With a new director, Jonathan Mostow (U-571), a new John Connor, Nick Stahl (Bully), and a story that seemed like a rehash of Terminator 2: Judgment Day it seemed that the naysayers would be right. I am pleased to say that they were only half correct about this film.<br/><br/>Ten years after John and Sarah Connor, with the help of a friendlier T-800, were able to stop the T-1000 and Judgment Day, John is in hiding. His fears prove to be well-founded as another, later model terminator, the T-X (the smashingly gorgeous Kristanna Loken), travels back to 2003 with a new mission. In the midst of the chaos, John meets Kate Brewster (Claire Danes of My So-Called Life fame), and it seems that their meeting at this time is not so much coincidence. A T-800 (Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger) leads John and Kate on a journey to learn the truth behind Judgement Day and to stop the T-X.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 is not the bomb that many thought it was going to be. Mostow is wise enough to keep the tone and the look of the movie close enough to Cameron's style as to not alienate this film from the rest of the series. He does, however, throw enough of his own flair into the mix that we do not feel we are watching an exact replica of Judgment Day. There are scenes of action in this film that are simply breathtaking to behold. Not thirty minutes into the movie one of the greatest scenes of vehicular mass destruction takes places and the movie rarely lets up until the end. The film begins to border ridiculousness in the action arena when you begin to notice that something blows up every ten to fifteen minutes. Fortunately, however, each and every action scene is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>
The actors here are all very strong. Schwarzenegger and Loken are both excellent in their parts. Arnold would have had no excuse to not play a perfect terminator; the real worry lay with the ability of Loken, a virtual unknown, to carry such a heavy role. Loken is a real delight as the T-X with her ability to create small moments with only her head and face movements. Nick Stahl is believable as John Connor and does a good job throughout. Claire Danes is decent in her role though she would qualify as the weakest link amongst the cast.<br/><br/>The real problem with the movie is the script. As hard as it tries, the story here is nothing we haven't seen from a Terminator film. Its good terminator versus bad terminator premise was carried out to much greater effect ten years ago with Judgment Day. The time-travel aspect and inherent paradoxes therein reach a new level of confusion in this film as both terminators have unnatural knowledge of each other's movements from the very beginning and the audience is left to wonder why this movie needed to be created after the finality of the last film. Also, there is far too much goofiness involving Arnold's terminator. Where Terminator 2 used carefully placed and crafted bits of humor to showcase the small bit of humanity contained within the machine, Terminator 3 uses the terminator as ludicrous comic relief when none is needed. Finally, the much talked about ending is admittedly a little weak and underwhelming in light of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>
There is no escaping comparison to the two films that came before Rise of the Machines. The first two in the trilogy are true examples of modern classics. While Terminator 3 tries its best, it is by far the weakest of the series. The admirable job done by the cast and crew to ensure this films place in the series, however, is to be commended. With less brains and more popcorn value, this film should satisfy most fans of the action filled saga."

I'll just add my agreement that it was both well-done and fit perfectly with the overall tone of the three movies.<br/><br/>OVERALL REVIEW<br/><br/>There are so many plot holes and silly devices that are wholly unnecessary. It seems the director had a certain artistic vision and was going to make a movie to fit that vision, come hell or high water.  Some obvious items of stupidity:<br/><br/>* If the female terminator (terminatrix?) is such an efficient killing machine, why does she choose to wear high heels which are totally impractical to the business of chasing people down?<br/><br/>* If she has such incredible powers to remotely control basic machines, why doesn't she use these powers to stop the very vehicles the good guys are using to get away?<br/><br/>* If the magnet is so powerful that it can hold back the super-strength of the terminatrix, how is John Connor able to keep carrying his guns?<br/><br/>* Why does Connor seem surprised that the terminator (Arnold) doesn't recognize him from ten years ago?  After all, Connor helped destroy the terminator from T2, so he knows this one can't be the same machine, right?<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie as a whole doesn't really make much sense.  The plot is basically identical to T2, with a few twists to make it interesting.  The special FX are good as expected, but really don't have any of the ""wow"" above and beyond the type of stuff we have already seen elsewhere.<br/><br/>RECOMMENDATION<br/><br/>Rent it for a rainy Saturday, and definitely watch all the way through to the very-worthwhile ending."

","WARNING: ENDING SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>If ever there was a project doomed from the very start, it had to be T3. The making of a terminator film without either James Cameron or Linda Hamilton was a recipe for disaster, and even mighty Arnold isn't what he once was. On top of that, the new director is Jonathan Mostow, a man whose only credits thus far have both been mediocre action flicks. And we end up with...<br/><br/>A mediocre action flick. Well, that's better than I'd expected.<br/><br/>Actually, this whole movie plays like a big piece of self-parody. It is undisputed fact the heyday of Schwarzenegger-style action is over, yet they still keep trying here. Nick Stahl, who has inexplicably been cast in the role of John Connor despite being the least heroic, least imposing, and least edgy actor working today, is a waste of space, and the moment at the beginning that shows him made up to look like his future self is the purest agony. Please Mostow! Cameron picked Edward Furlong and Michael Richards, BOTH of whom were perfect! Is this really the best you can do?<br/><br/>When compared to Robert Patrick's cold menace as the T-1000, Kristanna Loken is a waste of space as the T-X. She generates any menace only in the single shot used ubiquitously in the trailers, so it's one long letdown in the theatre. The new terminator's abilities are incredibly badly explained, and they also look stupid. And Claire Danes. I have nothing against Claire Danes. I like Clair Danes. She was great as Juliet, I loved her in The Hours, and she did a great voice for San in Princess Mononoke. But she is not Sarah Connor, nor will she ever be any substitute Sarah Connor awkwardly shoehorned as John's future wife to cover the fact that Linda Hamilton was smart enough to skip this project.<br/><br/>The action, as stated earlier, is mediocre at best. Cameron's gift for pushing the envelope is sorely missed. A fetish for big trucks, so subtly worked into the first two, sticks out Arnold's ridiculous new ""nuclear cell"" here. Mostow tries, and fails, to spice things up with some pointless gore and exposition, but neither works.<br/><br/>Now, finally, the good news. When we get to the titular event, which comprises the last act, things improve considerably. With a host of early-model HKs to play with, for the first time, we actually get some action scenes that not only get the adrenaline pumping, but do so an almost Cameron scale. We also see some actual Terminator-style production design for the first time in the film.<br/><br/>And then, there's the ending. Total nuclear annihilation. That's a courageous enough act of narrative to make me forgive a lot, and plus, its handling is sublime. Though that's largely because it's done in narration and we don't have to see Nick Stahl."
"bourgo","Null","0","0","27 January 2004"," unexpectedly fun and decent sequel
","I've read a lot of negative things about 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' so far, here on IMDb as well as in newspapers and magazines. A lot of (professional) reviewers meant that the film had clearly only been made to cash in some extra money by milking a familiar concept and that it did not live up to the expectations.<br/><br/>Although we are all entitled to our own opinions, I must say that I find most of this rather unfair. There aren't many third installments in a series that actually live up to their expectations (there aren't many first-sequels that do either, but T2 - although not as good as the original in my opinion - pulled that one off as well). The main reason for this is that most follow-ups simply try too hard; most producers think that what the audience wants is simply more action, bigger explosions and tougher opposition for the good guys. Therefor this is what we have come to expect and I think it speaks in T3's favour that it was not what we got. Mind you, it's not that the audience is getting less action than in the first two films, the makers just decided not to add to the abundance already there.<br/><br/>
One of the best things about this film is that it does not take itself too seriously. A lot of the one-liners (inevitable in films of this sort) are puns on the ones from the previous two films, and in some small scenes T3 actually makes fun of the entire franchise thus creating a parody of itself. In a way this puts things back into perspective, saying: ""look, we know it's corny, implausible and an exhausted formula, but it's good fun so what the heck.""<br/><br/>And good fun is exactly what this film is trying to be, nothing more and nothing less, and in that it has succeeded. To the filmmakers' credit the film didn't turn out to be pretentious, they didn't blow it by going over the top and they nicely wrapped up the trilogy plot-wise in the end thus avoiding all the pitfalls you might encounter when completing a series. It seems that the entire crew had a lot of fun making this film and it clearly shows.<br/><br/>The only thing I can say to those who have already seen the film and found it 'not living up to their expectations' is that it 'would' have if the studios were truly trying to milk the concept, but that they would probably have found it an even worse film as well. Those who are still planning on seeing this film I would advise to simply not expect anything at all and judge the film on its own merits; as you should with any film you watch."

","Let me first start by saying, Thank god this movie did not ruin the Terminator saga. For years I've been waiting for this film to arrive, and ever since it was first announced I never had negative thoughts on this movie. After those 3 years of waiting, I must say that I'm impressed by Mostows final product. No, it's not a Masterpiece like James Cameron's first two installments, buts its a worthy sequel. Alot of people have complained that there are too many plot holes, but there are no fewer plot holes than that of its 2 predecessors. The screenwriters and Mostow handled the continuation of T2 well. Don't get me wrong, this movie has its flaws, and YES James Camerons touch is missing, but does that make it a bad movie? No. 12 years is a long time to make a sequel, and based off of how poor some sequels are, I'm glad this one ended up a winner, box-office wise and critic wise. So on that note, congrats Arnold, Nick, Kristana, Clair etc...We now have another worthy entry into the collection of Sci-Fi trilogies. Hell, even bring on a Terminator 4.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5/10"

","This film should never have been made; James Cameron knew this, so did Linda Hamilton, unfortunately for the movie-going public Jonathan Mostow did not. The plot is referential to the vastly superior T2, to the point that the premise is almost exactly the same, aside from the gender of the villain. Arnie saves John Connor, check. Morphing bad guy, check. And so on. The major problem with this approach, apart from the fact that it makes for an unoriginal movie, is that Mostow does not have the justification to do it. He had no active involvement in the production of T2, therefore never earned the right to exploit the ideas of those who were involved.<br/><br/>Another problem with Mostow's approach to T3 is his unwitting insistence that more must mean better; a perspective undoubtedly conduced by the $170m budget. Witness the over-exuberant time machine bubbles that the Terminators arrive in - retaining similar effect to the first two films would have enhanced continuity and proved less of an irritating visual distraction. Obviously Mostow has not learnt when it is right to borrow.<br/><br/>All the blame for the flaws of this film cannot be lumped on Mostow's shoulders - the scriptwriter should take his weight. Admittedly, there were sporadic witty one-liners, but the major fault was a lack of attempt to capture audience involvement. The whole beauty of T2 was the subtext of the father-son relationship between the robot and the boy; executed so well that what could easily have been a tacky ending really worked. All that the death of Arnie elicited in T3 was a sigh of relief that the film must be reaching the end.<br/><br/>A do not consider this film a sequel. Period. 1 out of 4"

","Terminator 3 was probably set to not reach the same heights as the two previous entries.  James Cameron, Eddie Furlong and Linda Hamilton were not involved with it - a shame :(.  Also - I thought that they rapped the series up nicely at the end of the second film (destroying the last remnants of the Terminators to prevent Judgment Day from happening)....  However in Hollywood - when anyone is on a good thing - they will milk it to get a few bucks out of it.  Thus a few plot holes were exploited and... surprise-surprise - the machines live on. Terminator 3 opens up with John Conner (now 20-something) who is a drifter - not wanting to be connected to the system.  We learn that Judgment Day was only delayed from T2 - not preventing.  Of course - they send two terminators from the future to hunt and kill all the future leaders of the human resistance. This film isn't all that bad - I just don't think it reaches the high heights of the first two.  Cameron (when making sequels) - tends to follow the same rules of the first movie - while giving it a whole new fresh appeal.  Sadly - T3 doesn't feel as fresh as the first two and it tends to bend the rules a bit for its own devices.  Nor does the movie follow the basic plot lines of the original two films.  The Terminatrix is a good idea (to be female) - but doesn't reach the same levels of brutality as Arnie in the first movie and the T-1000 in the second.  Plus - it doesn't feel that radically different from the T-1000 (which was just a pleasure in T2)... all the shape shifting aspects are still there - but she just seems to have a few bells and whistles attached for fun (eg: controlling other machines / can fire off weapons).  I don't think they play off the Terminatrix's powers off to full potential - which was a shame. Overall - I don't think it is a bad movie - its just that it tries to be a different movie from the first two - without succeeding."

","After the superlative first two ""Terminator"" films, there seems to be little need for a third movie about the eponymous cybernetic assassin.  Yet this is what director Jonathan Mostow has produced, to surprisingly positive acclaim.  While this effort is certainly not a classic in the same league as its predecessors, ""Terminator 3"" is still an entertaining and inventive sci-fi thriller.<br/><br/>John Connor (Nick Stahl), once set to be mankind's future saviour, is now a computer hacker in his early twenties who lives on the road by his wits. His mother Sarah (the Linda Hamilton character from the first two films) has died of leukaemia since the events of the last film.  Unbeknownst to him, the apocalypse he thought he'd averted several years ago is nearly upon him. And once again he finds himself the target of two Terminators: one out to protect him, the other to destroy him.  The nightmare begins again...<br/><br/>The film's main strength is its excellent array of action sequences and effects.  Highlights include an inventive truck/car/bike chase sequence, a showdown in a weapons factory, a chaotic but oddly eerie shootout in a mortuary/graveyard, and the final confrontation in a desert retreat.<br/><br/>The acting is a quite mixed ranging from good to merely adequate.  Nick Stahl is good as John Connor, but does not bring enough depth or pathos to the role.  Claire Danes is on fine form as his romantic interest, and has a good relationship with her tragic father (David Andrews).  Sadly there is a lack of romantic chemistry between her and Connor that leadens too many dramatic scenes.<br/><br/>As for Arnie, well, he said he'd be back and he is.  Not once looking self-conscious or uncomfortable, Schwarznegger slips very easily back into the role that made him a star.  With the actor's recent foray into US politics, this is likely to be his last role for some time.  He handles all action and dramatic scenes very well.  It is both surprising and endearing that an actor of limited range like Schwarznegger can add depth and substance to what is mostly a one-note part.  Kristinna Loken is his new opponent, a T-X who simulates radio signals and whose arms can turn into rapid-firing machine guns.  With a lithe figure and menacing stare, Loken has a sinister screen presence.<br/><br/>The script here is OK, but nothing special and could have done without the pointless self-referentialism.  The story is very good, though, and presents us with an unexpectedly gloomy ending that sets the stage for further films.<br/><br/>""Terminator 3: Rise of Machines is not perfect but possesses enough action and just enough substance to make it a worthwhile flick."

In my opinion, there is no need for such blatant humour in a movie narrative that was originally motivated from a deep conscious paranoia of nuclear war and technological change. T3 should have brought into contention themes that are still relevant and scare us today. We know too much about computer technology to be taken in by idea of 'Software in Cyberspace'.<br/><br/>
In conclusion I will say that 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' needed to strike a cord with our fears to really polish off the trilogy and those fears breed within the anxiety of 'an unknown FUTURE'.<br/><br/>This was, without doubt a terrible, terrible movie whose profits only have the first two instalments to thank."

Considering he had to follow up such highly regarded sci-fi films, the outcome is more than acceptable and does not ruin the Terminator name.<br/><br/>
Much like his previous film Breakdown, Mostow is more concerned with keeping a breakneck pace and the level of tension high at all times. This often comes at the expense of character development and logic, but it hardly matters, as this movie is great fun from start to finish.<br/><br/>(Possible Spoilers)<br/><br/>Nick Stahl gives a reasonable performance as John Connor, who has now isolated himself from people and lives in fear. We learn that Judgement Day never occurred and was only postponed due to the events in Terminator 2. Now this time a female terminator, the TX (Kristanna Loken), has been sent back in time to stop John Connor from leading the revolution against the machines and another terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been sent to protect him. T3 principally follows the same plotline as T2 with an increased emphasis on action. The introduction of Clare Danes, as Kate Brewster, adds a strong female presence to the film and it just so happens that the writers found an inventive way to implement her into the story.<br/><br/>The action scenes in T3 are the highlight. What is great to see in this time of overblown CG effects is a film that is heavy on real stunts and practical special effects. The crane chase is certainly up there as one the great movie chases even surpassing the CG reliant freeway chase in The Matrix Reloaded.<br/><br/>T3 delivers some memorable action scenes, special effects and adequate story.

"LauraH2477","Null","0","0","28 November 2003"," Pretty good, but it can't hold a candle to T2.
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/> This is a very well done action film that's really fun to watch. Acting and special effects are excellent, and Arnold is funny as usual. But it actually does disappoint somewhat, because of course Sarah is gone and John is played by a different actor. The guy who plays John does a good job, but he just doesn't seem like the same person. I'm not sure it would have been much better with Edward Furlong playing the part, though, since this installment of the series lacks both the dark and brutal atmosphere of T1 and the emotional warmth and thought-provoking depth of T2. Those hoping for any deep connection between John and his protector in this episode will be disappointed.  This is a straightforward action flick that doesn't leave much room for that kind of development. And I do like Claire Danes, she always seems to put her all into a performance, but her character didn't really add much to the story. In T1 and T2, Sarah goes from an innocent young girl to a hardened warrior. Danes doesn't seem to do anything but scream and get knocked around. T3 is fun to watch, however, and the new female Terminator does some pretty cool tricks, though she isn't nearly as creepy as Richard Patrick's T-1000. All in all it's worth renting and even buying, as long as you're not expecting it to top T2, which was a masterpiece and the end of the story, as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>
PS - To those of you who think this was better than T2, please get real here. T2 was more than just an action/sci-fi flick, it was a deeply human story that had something important to say, while T3 is basically just a long, entertaining action sequence. Ok, I'll shut up now."

After all Cameron has managed to make some fairly good sequels. Then I found out Cameron was not on the job. My expectations dropped. Not that I'm a Cameron fanatic, don't get me wrong - it's just that I had never even heard of Mostow before.<br/><br/> Well let's make a long story short: I went to the movies and was at first pretty satisfied with the film. First impression good. However, the more I started analyzing it, the less I liked it. The plot was really just taken directly out of T2 and modified in a way to make it seem like new. Nothing new here, except this time the villain is in female form - that and John is older. By the time we get to the action (not too long) I started noticing how the pace of the movie has ruined it. The makers clearly thought that if there is enough action people forget about the plot holes. They had the inevitable car crashing bashing scene (please, haven't we seen enough of these already, they're in -every- action flick today!) and our heroes were so busy running around they didn't even have time to go over the situation. Character development: totally unbelievable (can't say more, I'd be spoiling). They couldn't make the story hold anymore, and what's worse it's still left open for a fourth episode.<br/><br/> The only part about this movie that I really enjoyed was Arnold. He is the sole reason to see the movie. His one-liners and cheesy accent are still worth a couple of laughs. And he does have a few new ones too.<br/><br/> All in all, the movie was ok, but that's just it. It wasn't great like it's predecessors. And I'm not going to say Cameron could have saved it, but I'm saying maybe Cameron had a reason for dumping the project.

It is full of the right ingredients necessary to brew up a summer blockbuster.  Swearing and explicit nudity is kept down to a minimum.  By today's standards, the gore is depicted in such a way that it does not overwhelm the viewer as it did in certain scenes of the previous two Terminator films. It demographically targets a very broad audience.  This equals Maximum Profit.<br/><br/>This is what it seems that Hollywood is after these days: Maximum Profit.<br/><br/>T3 lacks in emotional impact.  There is little to no emotional attachment built for the characters including the Terminator (T-800).<br/><br/>If you are looking for a profound and moving movie then you're not going to find it here.  This is a movie designed for today's 'MTV' audience.  It is designed to be fast and full of action.  It is not going to touch you the same way the first two movies did.  If you go into the movie expecting this then you will be disappointed."

","First I must say that this movie does not suck.  It is entertaining, and it's good to see Arnold still on the big screen.  That being said, what was the point of the movie?  They more or less rehashed T2 but with no suspense whatsoever, a consdierably weaker plot, writing that was a joke (intentionally at some points), and special effects just for the sake of special effects.  Also, some of things in this movie don't make sense, like how can the female terminator control cars just by touching them?  To steer the car you need an outside force, it's not all electronic.  Also, how can she control things she can't even see?  For being more advanced than the T1000, she certainly didn't seem any more menacing or dangerous to the heroes.  There were a few good lines in this movie, and I like Arnold, and for that I give it a 4/10."

Most of the characters in T3 had changed and I was left trying to adjust to  these new people throughout the movie.<br/><br/>
Since just one of the original characters returns, the movie makers try to create a diversion by way of special effects to distract you from realizing you don't know any of these people.<br/><br/>A sequel, by definition, is supposed to be a continuation.  Obviously the makers of this movie didn't agree; atleast with continuing with the same people.  However, they did agree that presenting a final episode (let's hope) of the Terminator series would surely bring in a big dollar.<br/><br/>

"mkfreeberg","Null","0","0","16 November 2003"," Can't say I'm not disappointed
","The lesson here is simple and useful. If you're watching an action movie where the action hero is just barely awake enough to protect his sweetie, to selflessly throw his body over hers when something blows up, but is too thick and stupid to see something coming that actually has something to do with the story... ...you are watching a chick flick. Like the Mighty Joe Young remake, or Final Destination II. Movies like this are different from Die Hard or James Bond movies, because it's up to John McClane and 007 to unravel the riddle in a mystery in an enigma. Indiana Jones can figure out the bad guy is digging in the wrong spot, so his movie is a guy's movie. Not the case here. If John Connor ever had this ability, he lost it before this movie started or picked it up after it was over. Everything has to be explained to him, while he listens, slack-jawed, then reacts with joy, despair, whatever. He never, ever puts himself ahead of the game, and it's obvious there is a crowd-pleasing rule in place to keep him from doing so.<br/><br/>Which would be fine, as far as spur-of-the-moment fun action-adventure flicks would be concerned. But leaving aside the point that this installment arrives after a twelve year wait, there's a huge logical plot hole here. John Crybaby Skywalker Connor is the leader of the resistance and it's worth sending a killer robot back in time, at presumably enormous expense, to rub him out. Why is that? If he gave the resistance life with his resourcefulness, or with his ability to motivate people, T4 is going to have to supply some explanation of how he picked these things up. I would not put my life on the line to follow this man. I would not so much as loan him a couple of quarters to do his laundry.<br/><br/>But he's George Washington of the 21st century. He makes the difference between a victorious (or insurmountable) resistance or no resistance at all, and he is shrewd and cunning enough to use time travel to arrange his own conception. It would have taken very little trouble to have him, just once or twice, work his way out of a jam like Michael Biehn did 20 years ago. That would have made all the difference to me.<br/><br/>Can plot & character problems completely ruin a movie? Maybe not, and that problem doesn't ruin this movie. But it certainly costs it some points. The time-travel thread in T1 made my head hurt, because I cared enough about what was going on to pursue it. Because of the shabby treatment T3 gave to the story and the characters, it can't ever give me that headache because I don't care that much. I can't say the saga has been ruined, but I can't say I'm not disappointed."

","I will be the first to admit, when I saw the original trailers for this film, I was very optimistic about it being any good. However, when finally viewing this film, I was pleasantly surprised....excellent continuation of the Terminator movies!!<br/><br/>This chapter starts 12 years after the second Terminator. Sarah Connor is dead, and John Connor is living as a drifter, moving from town to town, keeping his identity a secret even though he and his mother had stopped Judgment Day (or so he thought). Unfortunately, there is a newer, more sophisticated Terminator that has been sent back in time to kill John Connor, the future leader of the Resistance.<br/><br/>With excellent special effects, and not to mention a gorgeous Terminatrix, this movie packs non-stop action, as well as some laughs (the scene in the strip bar is priceless).

"JRmf","Null","0","0","16 December 2003"," T3 - weakest of the trilogy but worth seeing
","When I first saw the movie (big screen) I was disappointed 6/10 - admittedly T2 was a hard act to follow. However on seeing the movie again at home it made more sense and I enjoyed it more 7/10 (Terminator 8, T2 9-10).<br/><br/>Yeah so it is a CGI and action fest. But care has gone into trying to link the T3 to T and T2, especially John Conner's part in it. How does one come to an acceptance of a prophecy, that one is destined to be the Saviour Of The World? So one thing I thought was credibly done was how Connor (Nick Stahl) and Brewster (Claire Danes) came slowly, kicking & screaming to the realisation and acceptance of their pivotal roles in the future saving of humanity.<br/><br/>One major criticism to my mind is the mismatch between Connor and Brewster in apparent age. I suspect this was done in part to make them look like the oddest and unlikeliest of couples, but he looks like barely out of high school, while she looks like in her late 20s (not that I'd kick her out of bed..).<br/><br/>As for Arnie and Kristanna Loken (the T-X), well they are after all robots and in the movie unfortunately do not seem to have much character beyond that, contrasting sharply with T2 where Arnie achieves believable defacto father-figure status. In T3, the sense of the relentless pursuit of the T-1000 in T2 is missing, despite her embellished gizmos and supposedly superior mental abilities (little in evidence).<br/><br/>In retrospect T2 and T3 seem to be misnamed. The focus of T2 was the T-1000 itself, whereas T3 rushes to and culminates in Judgement Day. Rise of the Machines seems to only be in its most embryonic stage in T3, so the series is left open (I suppose) to a 4th movie where the machines do actually rise and are defeated, though with flagging interest in T3 and a known outcome in ""T4"" it might be a brave studio who risks it."

","2003 has been a strange movie year. Usually, you don't see a good third movie. Of course there are exceptions..ie RETURN OF THE JEDI, AUSTIN POWERS 3 and one of my favorites SUPERMAN III. But then you get your bombs as well..GODFATHER III (I refuse to acknowledge this movie exists), JAWS 3D, HALLOWEEN 3, etc. <br/><br/>In 2003, there were several very good third movies -- AMERICAN PIE 3, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, TERMINATOR 3 and in December, LORD OF THE RINGS 3.<br/><br/>When I first heard TERMINATOR 3 was being made, I was skeptical. No Jim Cameron, no Linda Hamilton, an unknown actor playing John Connor. TERMINATOR 3 was a pleasant surprise and I would rank it as one of the top films of 2003. <br/><br/>Granted Arnie isn't the Arnie of 10-15 years ago, but he still proves to be a top-notch action star. Nick Stahl is superb taking over for Eddie Furlong as John Connor. There are some pretty decent action sequences in here (truck chase, cemetary shootout, etc) but the humor is severely lacking from T2.<br/><br/>
The ending is a shock. You will never see it coming in a million years. But it does leave the door wide open for a TERMINATOR 4. Let's hope...but let's bring Cameron back for that one!"
"mbanwait","6","0","0","11 November 2003"," An above average action flick that embarrasses the franchise
","T3 is a pretty good action movie with enough destruction to sustain the movie.  But, the movie falls much short of the epic scope which was provided by T1 and T2.  Jonathon Mostow does a commendable job of keeping the pacing tight and action high, but does very little with the story line.  It is essentially a retread of T2.<br/><br/>In addition, I can forgive Mostow for using way too many absurd jokes at the expense of the Terminator in order to get a few chuckles from the audience.(Talk to the hand?!!  Elton John glasses?!!)<br/><br/>I don't think there could have been a better action movie made than T2. The only man who could have attempted to undertake T3 and make it as good as its predecessors would have to be James Cameron.  But I believe Cameron opted out because he knew himself he could not do it and did not want to dissapoint the audience.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the movie does seem to get better and better as you progress to the end.  The crane action stunt is absolutely amazing.  And we have to mention Arnie.  The man is and forever will be remembered as the Terminator. The TX again is a passable advesary, but Robert Patrick's T1000 will be remembered as the best villian from the Terminator series.<br/><br/>I think this movie is definitely a rental. Not much on the DVD and the flick does not warrant multilple viewings ala T2.  I am sure there will be some sort of triple deluxe super edition in a couple of years just in time for Governor Arnie to make a come back in T4 fresh in his Golden years.<br/><br/>6/10 /mb"

","In the Terminator series, the robots themselves (sorry cyborgs) are composed of flesh over steel exoskeletons.  This movie has the steel but not flesh.<br/><br/>It looks good on screen, the stunts are fine, the actors attractive, but there is no depth, just a series of set pieces with loose connections.  Many scenes were scripted just to produce references to the preceding films, and otherwise have no place.  The movie has ""SAFE"", written all over it, the kind of don't mess with the formula filmmaking that dominates Hollywood.<br/><br/>But they left out part of the formula, and that is emotional involvement. You don't feel for the characters, there is no fear or sorrow or suspense or anything remotely resembling empathy for any part in the film.  Jokes fall flat because there is no drama taking place that requires comic relief. Clare Danes' character loses her father and fiance to the new TX with barely a moment's grief.  Kristanna Lokken is great to look at but not exactly scary and the scenes of her and Arnold's Terminator character throwing each other around are incredibly boring.  Speaking of boring, Nick Stahl's John Conner has gone from disaffected youth to spaced out adult, supposedly hiding behind drugs because he fears the future.

","This is the best of the trilogy. Let's hope there's not another decade before the fourth. I'm not normally a fan of big Hollywood blockbusters, not least the high-grossing trilogies of recent years (Harry Potter, Matrix, Lord of the Rings), but there's something about the first two Terminator films I've always liked. Maybe because it's set in the real world, I don't know. When I had the opportunity to see a preview of Terminator 3, I thought I was bound to be disappointed, not least because the director Jonathan Mostow made the appalling U571. But I was enthralled. From start to finish, I couldn't tear my eyes from the screen for one moment. Much of the film is similar to the first two, in that there's an evil Terminator after the good guy with someone from the future to protect them. Cue high adrenalin car chases, stunts, explosions, etc., all done with panache and good humour. But there's more to this movie than its predecessors, more than just simple chasing. There's a bigger picture, about fate, about the relentless march of technology and the naivety of the American military. Quite simply, it's an interesting film. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are believable and have good chemistry, Arnie is entertaining, with some great one-liners and the female Terminatrix blends in without any problem."

","Having seen this film 12 years after the great T2, I was hoping to feel as involved in the characters and feel the realism of the action like I did in T2, but I felt nothing, from start to finish.  I didn't feel like this was a terminator movie.  This was more of a TV pilot to translate T2 into a show for Showtime.<br/><br/>The storyline is surprisingly decent, but not very strong and catchy.  It ultimately feels conveluted and made up only to make more money and not to continue the story.  It's like hiring a soap opera writer to create a sequel to Romeo & Juliet.  I liked the ""future wife"" aspect of the story, and making Judgement Day inevitable just took everything we were told to believe in the second film, and threw it out.  So much for the whole moral of ""There's no fate but what we make for ourselves"".  I guess you can't make much more money if you end the series that way, so they ignored it, and squeezed this one out of an orafice.<br/><br/>The Connor family that we've grown to care about was suddenly gone, with only a glued-on backstory to explain the changes.<br/><br/>The new John Connor has no or little tension in his acting.  Nothing about him makes me feel he's real.  He starts off as a cliche' depressed teenager. He claims to be a loner, but I just don't feel he's anything more than another hot young face being dragged across the latest magazine covers to sucker us into thinking he's important.  We spend little time getting to know Claire Daines, and feel nothing for her.<br/><br/>The new Terminatrix is played by some apparent model who does a fairly good job by simply pretending to be Robert Patrick from the second installment. The only difference in her performance from Patrick is the special effects that are done with her.  She comes with a flamethrower, a magic internet key spike, and a lack of ability to mimic other people.  Personally, I think the T-1000 (Patrick) was a much better villain.  He could slip through small cracks and holes to get to his enemy, and couldn't get stuck to a magnet.<br/><br/>The whole Skynet headquarters, or whatever you want to call it, looks like a cheap rejected set from Stargate SG-1, as well as the characters and their wardrobe.  Nothing about these people are believable, so again, we feel nothing.<br/><br/>In some scenes (Endoskeletons in battle, Arnold missing half his flesh, and Terminatrix losing her metal skin on a magnet) the CGI effects are top of the line.  They feel real.  However the scenes involving the CG Hovercrafts and nuclear explosion of central LA look incredibly fake. You can see the individual circular CG puffs that make up the mushroom cloud. The chrome surfacing on the Hovercrafts look like something from The Lawnmower Man. They look completely untangible, and I don't feel the suspense of their presence. I could see how hard they were trying to convince us that it was real by having a harsh brushed-metal surface, while the previous practical counterparts were just a simple soft polish.  You only should use CG where you have no choice.  In this case, they believe erasing a few strings from a hovering model isn't as effective to them as replacing the entire thing with unfinished-looking CGI. Also, I'm not in suspense when I'm supposed to fear being crushed by noticeably CG vehicles.<br/><br/>The worst problem with T3 in my opinion is the cinematography.  It's not horrible DP work, but it doesn't have that ""we're involved in the action"" feel that the second film had.  This felt like we were spectators, rather than players.  The lighting didn't feel suspensful.  The editing had little rhythm.  The choices for camera angles were uninvolving.  It's like for each moment of the story, they had to spin a roulette wheel of storyboard angles for the same shot, and whatever the needle landed on, that was the camera angle they chose.<br/><br/>Since the script is the heart of a production, I give it more credit than I normally would.  6/10"

","Yes, it is my opinion also that this is the worst of all the three films. Although many people might consider T1 was the best, I still think that T2 was the most captivating and well-made of the series. But when I enthusiastically went to the cinema to see this film I was shocked by its complete shallowness, low quality acting and the many cliches that it throws at the public. The most obvious one is the fact that they assigned the post of a killing machine to a hot chick dressed in a sexy leather suit... I am a guy, I don't mind seeing beautiful women but not in a movie that advertises itself as the best in the Terminator series. I'd rather see a huge guy with muscles than a good looking girl. Also I have seen T2 many times but I couldn't stand to see T3 more than once. I hope that out of respect for us they don't make another Terminator, ever. This 3rd part completely killed the series and canceled any of the good impressions that T2 had left."

","This is a fairly entertaining sci-fi action film, but it pales in comparison to the original Terminator movies.  It's lacking in artistic direction and the cast is weak.  <br/><br/>James Cameron is a terrific storyteller and takes care of the minutest of details, but here the events just happen without proper sequencing. Jonathon Mostow is in way over his head.  <br/><br/>The acting is also a problem.  Arnold is good as the Terminator, but Nick Stahl is very bad in the role of John Connor.  There's nothing heroic about him at all.  Eddie Furlong was a tough kid and you could buy him growing up to be a leader of the humans in the future, but Stahl doesn't suggest anything other than a future 7-11 clerk.  <br/><br/>Also, there's no Linda Hamilton character, no strong female lead - Claire Danes brings nothing to the table.  Kristanna Loken is alright as the T-X sent back to kill John Connor, but she isn't required to do much acting what with the computer animators doing most of it for her. <br/><br/>Why did they make this movie?  There was nothing left from the second film that needed to be clarified, nothing here clever enough to add to the Terminator myth.  It was made only for the sake of money, but with production costs so high, even that didn't work.<br/><br/>As a stand alone film, it's OK entertainment.  There's lots of action and the special effects are good.  There's even some humor written into the script.  But when you look at it in the context of ""T2-Judgement Day"" it's a major disappointment.<br/><br/>Thankfully, with Arnold as governor now, we don't have to worry about another sequel.  Even these producers couldn't be stupid enough to make a Terminator 4 without Arnold."
"crawfrordboon","7","0","0","9 November 2003"," Two thumbs up!
","I entered the cinema for this one very excited at the prospect of the third Terminator film and the first for twelve years. This was Arnold's chance to put his movie career back on track after the near-misses of the last five years or so. I was also rather nervous - I am a big fan of Mr Schwarzenegger, and if the California governership rumours were true (and of course they were), this could well be his last chance to make a huge impact to rival that of Terminator 2. I truly wanted him to succeed, and for the film to be a huge hit. Thankfully I wasn't dissapointed.<br/><br/>
Spoiler alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>
When I left that same cinema two and a half hours later (i had entered for the trailers too), I felt a little confused about what I had seen, how good a film it was in itself, and how it rated compared with T1 and T2. One thing though was certain - Arnold was back in a big way and this is his best since True Lies, of which it is a fair equal. The big man himself didn't let himself down with an eye-catching performance, especially as he thrashed the evil T-X around, breaking everything in sight!<br/><br/>My main problems with the film were:<br/><br/>* there is no ending, simply a ""tune into to T4 to find out what happens. This was a shame as both previous films enjoyed a ravishing and conclusive finale.<br/><br/>* Arnold's character is not given enough screen time, and too often he is making jokes and comic lines instead of dialogue that sets him up as a believable cyborg. After all, this T-101 should be exactly the same as the T-800 at the start of Terminator 2, with the same fearsome qualities and mechanic responses. Unless he was reprogrammed by John Connor before he was sent back in time, but that doesn't explain why he didn't reprogram the T-101 from T2 on similar lines. Unless he wanted to give his former self a chance to learn what is needed to be done in the future, a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.<br/><br/>* It feels like a remake of T2. There's not much elaboration on the plot, other than John Connor being a depressed itinerant junkie, and the introduction of Kate Brewster. Sarah Connor is dead, but i half expected that, her character came full circle at the end of T2 when she shakes hand with the T101. Also the relationship between the Terminator and John Connor is ambiguous most of the time, John is mostly over familiar with it.<br/><br/>* The introduction of Kate Brewster, and of her past involvement in the plot of T2, the 'destiny' John talks about, is unwarranted. This messes with a previously perfect film (T2). Also the whole thing of Kate being John's future wife, and of him being killed by the Terminator before Kate sends it back, is uneccessary. You're making T4, why not leave all that until then, where it belongs. Here it just feels goofy. Plus the Terminator should know better than to inform people of their own future, John should have programmed it into him. As any fan of Back to the Future should know!<br/><br/>* The T-X, played by Kristanna Loken, just isn't scary. She hasn't got the physical presence to match up with Arnold Schwarzengger, and the use of weaponry rang false to me - why does it need weapons to beat a machine which it is supposedlly far in advance of? She should have been made more menacing, for example the child murder scenes should have been more graphic and disturbing, giving us an idea of the TX's capabilities.<br/><br/>* Whenever either the T-X appears to menace the mortal main characters, along comes the T-101 to save them, despite a lot of running around that in my view really wasn't necessary. Plus, with all those prototype robotic terminators, and the ability of the TX to control mechanic things, it really should have been a piece of cake for it to wipte out John and Kate. Feels less plausible than the first two.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Apart from these few minor gripes though, I enjoyed the film. Arnold is once again at the top of the action tree, and is well supported by Nick Stahl and Clare Danes, though neither had too much to do in their roles, playing more human characters, with few memorable characteristics. Linda Hamilton is gone, and Kate Brewster character goes from being an innocent vetinary worker to a dead eye Terminator-killing sharpshooter without any discernible character changes in between. She just picks up an AK47 and off she goes.<br/><br/>
I'm letting the negatives get in the way here, but what I should say is that this has the look and feel of a major action blockbuster, and whilst its not up there with the first two in the series, its light years ahead of the crap we seem to get in cinemas these days. Especially good was the extended car chase that had a 1980s feel, and the 'coffin sequence,' a pure genius scene that I will never forget.<br/><br/>All in all, the best film of the year, and on this evidence, if things don't work out for Arnold in Sacramento, he'll be welcome back for the finale of this franchise any day!"

Which is unfortunate.  <br/><br/>I thought the movie was okay, it the 100 some minutes fly by.  But then again T3 is horribly short.  (with the t2 special edition running over 150 minutes long)<br/><br/>There are some odd timeline mistakes.  John Conner is quoted as saying at the beginning they attacked him when he was 13.  Ouch.  Thats gotta hurt. If you watch T2 Robert Patricks keys John's name into the cop car's computer and it clearly states he was born in 1985.  And that he was 10 years old. Even on the disc 2 of T3 it says 1995.  So I assume that T3 takes place between 2005-2010.  Which doesn't seem like the time it's supposed to be in. And why use The Blue Man Group for the credit song.  Hey they are weird, but only on video.  So so as music.<br/><br/>I was a bit peeved they had to kill Sarah Connor off.  There wasn't alot of reason to do this.  Musta been awfully young for what got her. <br/><br/>
Other pet peeves.  Whats up with coloring the Terminator's teeth?  They used to be the color of metal.  They are white now.  Alot of the future scenes were poorly done.

","The summer of 2003 will be known for two things in Hollywood.  The year of the sequel and the year that movie titles forced theatre owners to run out and buy more letters for their marquee.  Between Lara Croft: Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, movie listings read more like a novel than a short listing of start times.<br/><br/>Enter Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, the third installment of the Terminator series that sent Arnold Schwarzenegger to stardom and made a household name of James Cameron before he decided to spend his life looking for a shipwreck. <br/><br/>In this third time around, gone are Director Cameron, stars Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong, and even liquid metal man Robert Patrick has been replaced.  Enter Director Jonathon Mostow (U-571), new John Conner, Nick Stahl (In the Bedroom), Claire Danes (Romeo + Juliet) and new Terminator villain Kristina Loken.  Oh yeah, Arnie is back too.The movie begins with a grown up John Conner describing to the camera how he has lived his life since we last left him.  He has no address, no phone, no home. <br/><br/>
Soon, a motorcycle accident puts him in the same room as Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), just as the new female terminator, T-X, shows up with the intention of killing both humans. Ok, enough story, let the special effects begin.   Just 15 minutes into the film, we see the new and improved Terminator make weapons with her arm, turn from liquid into human form and show strength beyond the skills of Terminator 2's, T-1000. Even Arnold says that she is an upgrade that has made him obsolete and defeating her will be unlikely.  But that doesn't mean we can't have fun along the way.<br/><br/>A chase scene through the streets of Los Angeles between a pet clinic truck, a fire engine and a wide load crane was brilliantly choreographed as the Terminator tries to thwart T-X's attempts to kill John Conner and in doing so takes out countless cars, trucks, and even a glass building. T3 might not be as original as the first films, but it does stay true to the timeline and more importantly, it continues the story of the fight against the machines. We find out the fate of Sarah Conner, learn more about Skynet and how the machines took control, we see the first terminators activated and it is revealed that Arnold's character kills John Conner in the future. But who cares.  We want to see the two terminators do battle and we are not disappointed.  From the first moment that the T-X gets run over by Arnold's truck, to a spectacular fight sequence in a men's room (hey, who wouldn't pay to see Schwarzenegger hit a woman over the head with a urinal?), to the final confrontation at the Skynet lab, the action is unrelenting. <br/><br/>There are a few faults with the movie.  Nick Stahl could have better cast and there are too many coincidences (John and Kate just happen to be together when the T-X arrives, Kate's father works for Skynet etc.). However, the franchise is kept fresh with an interesting story and loads of humour (Arnold shows up naked at a bar during Ladies Night) and inside jokes (the cat requiring attention is called Hercules).  It's even nice to see Earl Boen back as Dr. Silverman for a third time. So it's not a great film.  So what.  Things go boom and people go splat. Bring it on!"

There are some nice effects in some parts but most of the time it's just annoying. There's nothing original about it. I'd recommend watching Cypher instead but you'll probably want to see T3 anyway just for the sake of it (just like the creators counted you would).

Please, try to stay awake, it gets better. John Connor, who lives ""off the grid"" (an interesting concept symbolised by his throwing a bottle of Bud in a river) meets his old girl-friend from school, just in time for both of them to get attacked by a naked female Terminator.  Unfortunately for the future of mankind, this is a ""12"" certificate movie, so we don't even get to see her bod.  Which might just have alleviated the boredom.  Also, that ""12"" means we cut down on the violence too.  Hmmm, a Terminator film with no violence and a boring villain who's nowhere near as sinister or impressive as the ones in the first two.

","Synopsis Spoiler! If you want a movie with a lot of action, Terminator-3 is for you.  It is the continuation of the series of Terminator movies by Arnold Schwarzenegger.  We have waited 10 years for this one to come to the screen and the wait has been worth it.  In T-3, the Terminator is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) from the Terminatrix, played by Kristanna Loken who is a faster, better, and later robot version than the Terminator.  This Terminator looks like Arnold but he is not the exact robot from T-2, however, he repeats many of the same things from T-2 that we love him for, such as `I'll be Back'.  The best action scene of the whole movie is the scene with the Terminator ridding a motorcycle after the Terminatrix as she is driving a huge crane-truck down the street and destroying the whole block as she was chasing after John Connor and his future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) in her van.  It is a thrilling and action pack movie that is a must see.   There is only one problem; it goes by so fast that you will want more. 10/10"
"lesmoyes","Null","0","0","17 October 2003"," Have we reached the Terminus yet?
","If you want lots of fighting, special FX, CGI, explosions and noise cleverly cocooned in a contrived script that does not stand up to too much analysis then this film is for you. I personally reckon that, if this is the best that Hollywood can come up with, the Terminator formula has been milked dry; new ideas are just too thin on the ground to make this a serious sequel to the previous two movies. Who is to blame....the screenplay author? The director? Probably both. The inevitable one-liners and certain plot elements reduced this to a very tongue-in-cheek action film. Suspension of belief is what Hollywood movies are mostly about but this came as very much of a personal disappointment after the excellent T2. Okay, so we got eye candy in the form of a female Terminator, the T-X. Gorgeous to look at but hardly credible as a character. T2 cast Robert Patrick as the ""latest model"" terminator because the plot called for the menace to be manifest through superior technology and ability rather than sheer size and brute force. So T2 has a regular guy-sized bad Terminator and T3 then makes the bad Terminator a woman.<br/><br/>What can we expect next in the inevitable T4? Maybe an infant Terminator - the TOT?<br/><br/>The manner in which T3 ended blatantly left the door open for yet another sequel but this may depend on various factors, not least of which will be Governor Schwarzenegger's busy schedule over the next several years. If they leave it too long they will have to have serious rethink about how to develop the plot to account for Mr Schwarzenegger's advancing years as he is, despite the make-up girls' best efforts, starting to show his advancing years - God he looked old when he delivered that line ""I am a machine"" - but then he had been in in few fights by then and what we see is supposed to be living human tissue over a metal skeleton.....<br/><br/>If there is going to be a T4 I hope to God they get back to decent scripts otherwise they might as well consign the thing to TV as happened to Star Gate (good film, absolutely dreadful series). <br/><br/>Alternatively knock it on the head altogether as this particular gravy train looks to be approaching the terminus."

"kellyadmirer","Null","0","0","10 October 2003"," Top Action Movie Facing Unrealistic Expectations
","It seems fashionable for some to critique this movie based on their reaction to the political success of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  By using their comments on this film to criticize voters and/or ""America"" for choosing an actor as governor (California, by the way, is not synonymous with the entire US), they overlook the fact that by slamming a movie for that reason they commit the same error they say they abhor - allowing someone's performance in one field to cloud your judgment about them in another.<br/><br/>So, here I critique the the film and not my reaction to Mr. Schwarzenegger's political success - with which I and apparently the majority of real-world US folks have no problem, just for the record.  This is a great action film. Unfortunately, it is a sequel to two of the best action films of all time. This unfortunately causes a number of problems that this film handles well, but not perfectly.<br/><br/>A major problem is that each sequel becomes less and less original - by necessity.  If you are a Star Trek fan, you can't help but notice the same problem.  There is too much ""canon,"" too much framework that inhibits the creative process.  It gets taken to absurd lengths by some, as they try to point out ""flaws"" in a character's age at various points in the movies' continuum.  These are movies, not documentaries, a fact some who get a little too involved seem to forget.<br/><br/>I thought T3 handled the ""canon"" problem well.  Certain changes in the ""timeline"" established in the first two films but changed in this film are explained away well by the simple device that the events of those films actually changed future ""history.""  Of course, the problem with that is that other things are said to be ""inevitable,"" which does not quite square with ""changes.""  We can let the metaphysicists and fan(atic)s quibble about this, things like that do not disturb the average moviegoer in my opinion.<br/><br/>Another ""problem"" handled well is the immutable fact that actors age between sequels.  Now, a robot doesn't age, so if the actor changes appearance, that is kind of difficult to accept.  However, I thought that Schwarzenegger carried off his part brilliantly and basically made you overlook the fact that he no longer is in his 30s as he was when he first played the role. There is less raw physicality and more humor and strategic calculation by the character.  I like the change, personally, and find the banter a needed relief from the overwhelming somber tone of the series.<br/><br/>A third problem is explaining in reasonable terms how the future ""rebel leader"" becomes a leader at all.  T2 established the character as an annoying, basically useless brat.  T3 carries the characterization forward in what I felt was a reasonable fashion.  I will not give away the ending, but suffice to say that I thought the screenwriters' solution was very neat and believable.<br/><br/>A fourth problem is that the ""bad Terminators"" have to keep getting more and more menacing in order to achieve shock value and conform with certain elements of the storyline.  How, though, is that possible when each in turn is about as invulnerable as the writers can dream up?  I thought this was the weakest part of the movie.  The evil female terminatrix is simply not very menacing, at least relative to the amazing one in T2.  One can search for reasons why a female robot was sent back - listen carefully to the dialogue and you will notice who was still around at the (future) time to be doing the sending - but there was nothing particularly original about this movie's villain.  I think when people fault this movie, this area is the basic source of their concerns.<br/><br/>As for the script, I think it is clever but, as I said above, increasingly constrained by the ""canon.""  Nothing in the movie is completely unexpected, all goes according to (slightly altered) plan.  I think the filmmakers made the Schwarzenegger robot more avuncular in reaction to this problem.  The device works to a certain extent, but creates an uneasy, conflicting dynamic that tends to undermine the creative tension so necessary for the suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>All in all, a good film, worthy successor to its predecessors and a very worthwhile cinematic experience.  In terms of overall quality, though, more in line with a ""Godfather 3"" than a ""Godfather 2.""  Enjoyable and with several memorable scenes (Arnold firing a gun while carrying a casket, some good chase/fight sequences), but not quite achieving the classic status of the first two."

","It is sheer coincidence that I saw this film just when Schwarzenneger presented his nomination in the political arena.  But not surprising, really, when Hollywood is taking over the Capitol and the trend that started with Reagan's Star Wars shield to protect American innocents from the evil threatening the globe, has been taking new twists and turns.  The obsession has a long history, since the invention of the cinema which has played a far greater part in American politics than any other single influence.  From Griffith's fascistic Birth of a Nation to milder modes of Star Trek and currently Star Gate.  The message is always, ""We, the American Nation, know best, and will fight to the death to convert the others to our own way of 'democracy'"".<br/><br/>T3 is no different, the righteous America defeats evil (even in the form of a very sexy terminatrix).  It is as if the collective American ID is trying to invite a catastrophe of immeasurable magnitude beyond the make-belief scenarios of Hollywood.  9/11 will sharpen this paranoia enormously until the whole continent turns into a kind of Howard Hughes. To exorcise this growing paranoia in films like T3 and others of the same ilk, is like holding a tress of garlic against the invisible face of absolute evil.<br/><br/>It must not be forgotten that in the Forbidden Planet what destroyed the planet was the uncontrollable ID."

","The third installment in the Terminator series is the weakest, but still entertaining. It's very difficult for the second movie in a series to be as good as the first one, much less the third movie. Alien 3 is an example, as well as Alien Resurrection. Both were far weaker than Alien and Aliens, and so it is with this movie. Schwarzenegger is back as the protective robot, facing a female terminatrix: Kristanna Loken. Neither part requires great acting, other than maintaining the same dementia-like affect throughout the film. Schwarzenegger is satisfactory in his role; this time around he becomes a source of most of the film's humor, spouting a succession of tag-lines, each one funnier than the previous one. Some of them poke fun at his lines from the previous movies. However, the ""talk to the hand"" bit seems way out of character, and seems designed to break up the target demographic more than anything else. Loken is one of many young hottie actresses that are displaying high octane girl power these days. However, she is not nearly as compelling as Robert Patrick was in T2. The reason has more to do with the script than anything else. The movie consists of one action sequence and/or long chase scene after another. The bridging story line scenes verbalize the character relationships rather than allowing them to develop. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes add little in their roles and they could have been played by any other actors with little difference. The ending offers a significant twist, and the hope for yet another sequel. The highlights of the movie are the action scenes, which are ferocious. The best scene involves a chase with an overhead crane vehicle, driven by Loken, pursuing Stahl and Danes in a pickup truck, with Schwarzenegger trying to intervene. A bathroom fight scene, between Schwarzenegger and Loken, is a close second. If the story and supporting characters were stronger, this would be on par with the first two movies. However, there are many movies that consist of weak stories and characters overloaded with great action that are still entertaining enough; this is one such movie. *** of 4 stars."

","My Rating: *** out of ****.<br/><br/>Ok, Terminator 3 is unnecessary but its so enjoyable it makes up for it. It is the weakest of the trilogy and I think a fourh Terminator would not be a good idea. But nevertheless Terminator 3 is one entertaining ride.<br/><br/>
The story is pretty much the same as Terminator 2. Most critics and fans saw this as a huge flaw. But I did not mind it at all, Terminator 2 is one of the best sci-fi/action films and I wouldn't mind if the sequel did it again. <br/><br/>The acting is mixed. Arnold Schwarzenneger is excellent here, he has this role down. Kristiana Loken is playing the TX, her performance is showing a lack of emotion and having an evil stare, which she does quite well. Claire Danes is fine, but I have never been a big fan of her. However, Nick Stahl terrible, he comes off like a wuss instead of a future hero.<br/><br/>
The action is quite impressive here. Theres a fight scene between the TX and The Terminator thats fantastic. The only part of the action I didnt like was the chase scene, I found it kind of overblown. <br/><br/>Terminator 3 is well-paced and will keep you interested throughout. Some people complain the humor was too much. Some of the humor may be a little much, but I thought some was quite funny. Terminator 3 ranks as one of the better films of the summer."

The John Connor charcater was well played but compared to his attitude in T2 he was a pretty wimpy. I really liked the way TX could turn and stuff. and the car scene was really cool. I think it took 3 million,to make. Anyway, even though T3 wasn't as good as 2 it was better than the terminator 1. But it was one oft the best movies iv'e seen at the cinema for a long time,despite the lack of music. And of course it has a lot of funny 'n' famous arnie one-liners.

","So far, I seem to be the only Terminator fan who was disappointed with this movie!!<br/><br/>T3 is just another example of Hollywood changing making a great movie and turning it into a money-making franchise.<br/><br/>When I watched this movie, it didn't even feel like I was watching a Terminator movie!!<br/><br/>We all know that T1 and T2 were great movies, there's no doubt about that, but T3 was missing that special something that makes a Terminator movie.<br/><br/>It missed the great work of James Cameron, the director of the first 2 Terminator movies, and all of his trademarks were gone. The Terminator didn't have any great memorable lines like he did in the first 2 movies. The worst line was ""I'm back!!"" It was more Arnie saying that he was back in another blockbuster rather than the Terminator!<br/><br/>The music was also missing, the great music by Brad Fiedel. The Terminator music was great and this movie just didn't use it at all, another great Terminator trademark missing!!<br/><br/>Even John Connor wasn't as big a person as he was before. John Connor was the main reason for the Terminator, without him, the movie wouldn't exist. In this movie, the Terminator doesn't really care for him as much. Their great relationship, as seen in T2, was gone. I think that Edward Furlong should of come back as John Connor as he is much older, i think it would've made more sense and seem more realistic.<br/><br/>Overall, I was really dissapointed and I hope they don't make a T4!"

","Before watching this movie (which I was quite much looking forward to) I watched the first parts of the ""trilogy"" once again to dive into the great dark-futuristic scenario to be able to get this movie the right way. I am not saying that the predecessors were great movies in a sense of intellectually or artistically qualitative films, but they created a really impressive atmosphere and were just good entertainment.<br/><br/>This movie is different. The whole background is taken from the older movies, no new ideas. Just action. Action, action, action. All the time. Man, how I was bored. I admit, the special effects were good, but you can't save a movie just with that. The dialogues (the few that there are) are really embarassing, both for the actors (especially Arnold S. who once again shows that he did NOT become famous for his skills as an actor, but for his unvoluntary comic) and for the spectators.<br/><br/>If you really want to watch this movie, I recommend that you don't do it without several beers and a good company you can discuss how bad with how bad it was afterwards. The only good point I could find was the (hidden) criticism of the US-defense shield. But that couldn't make up for all the sad rest. Sad. Really Sad."

","Okay, this isn't as good as the original or T2 but it's still a damned good movie.<br/><br/>It's got everything you want from a summer action flick and bags more. You want action? How about a 20 minute chase involving a giant crane, remote controlled cop cars and a vet wagon? Humour? The new TX has a mischievious nature while Arnie's entrance is bordering on self parodying hilarity. How about effects? Top notch, Stan Winston and ILM creating brilliant futuristic battle scenes, superb robotic effects and plenty of pyrotechnics to boot.<br/><br/>
Acting wise I felt Ed Furlong was missed. Nick Stahl was perfectly amiable as the older John Connor, but I really missed T2's Connor, full of young inocence and cool, his flippant character replaced by a scared, frail older version, who wore a constant frown on his weathered face. Arnie was back and was on great form, he just slotted back into his role as the Terminator as if he'd been doing it all his life. As for the newcomers, Kristianna Loken started off interestingly but quickly deteriated, she wasn't anywhere near as good as Robert Patrick in T2, failing to display the menace that anihilation was just around the corner. And Claire Danes as Kate, while an important character plot wise, did little more than scream a lot and look scared.<br/><br/>Still, the best thing about this film wasn't the acting, action or attempts at humour, but the bold, brilliant ending. Without giving anything away I'll just say: IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!<br/><br/>There are rumours of more Terminator films in the pipeline, but I for one hope that is untrue. They should leave it be as this perfectly complements the other two films and serves as a terrific final part of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Overall a 8/10 for this one."

","To be perfectly honest im 22 and i remember the time when the second terminator movie was released and it was a mega hit, i was ten at the time but have been seriously interested in films since i can remember. T2 was an awesome movie and ive wrote a review on this page about it. T2 was dark and true to its storyline, the t800 acted like a machine and all its actions and reasons for its actions were well explained. The story in T2 was second to none, it really develled into the hellish nightmare of the nuclear war and the performances from linda hamilton were nothing short of excellent but to know more about T2 read my review this is about T3 which i have to be honest i wanted to be so amazing and true to the first to films but turned out to be nothing more than a money spinner for C2 pictures and schwarzenegger, there was absolutly no storyline or plot there was no character development, Arnie did not play the T800 at all like the other two movies and the attempt of humour in a film meant to be so dark was just pathetic, james cameron made the humour in T2 non self conscious so not to take away the intensity of this all powerfull machine. with all things said T3 has alot of eye candy but overall is poorly acted poorly written and poorly directed. T1 gets 8 out of 10 it looses points simply coz the effects are very dated, T2 gets 12 out of 10 there really is no way in which this film could be better and T3 gets 3 out of ten merely coz of its effects."

The bad point are from the beginning you dont get the feel that this is a terminator movie , no heavy intro etc. It a bit like a bond film without the trademark gun-barrel beginning. I can understand how a new director would like to bring his own twists but this is difficult in a medium such as terminator.

The parts are there: The situation is urgent, The new Terminator is terrifying, and Arnold's bot is milked for even more genuinely funny deadpan, but with a surfeit of choppy action and dearth of any other emotional material, you're left with a movie that doesn't take itself seriously enough to warrant the audience's loyalty. Not to mention the unforgivable lapses in logic and decidedly unintelligent hunting techniques of the new cyborg.

","Does the following two statements apply to you?<br/><br/>Terminator - ""I liked it alot"".<br/><br/>Terminator 2 - ""I loved it, it excelled in a superior manner.""<br/><br/>If you answered ""yes"", then you will not like Terminator 3, and in truth you would be better off not seeing it. By not seeing it, you will preserve the memory of the two previous movies without tainting them. Should you despite this warning choose to view T3, then please note that you will never again be able to view the previous movies without conjuring up the ghosts of T3.<br/><br/>Are you thinking ""it can't be that bad, this person just didn't understand it""?<br/><br/>I too thought along this line when prewarned about it, I imagined that it had to have some entertaining qualities given it being a Terminator movie. Movies like that just aren't all-out bad.<br/><br/>I was wrong, I should have listened to the person who warned me.<br/><br/>Right about now you are thinking ""I refuse to be the only person on the planet to not have seen T3, simply because of a warning on IMDB.""<br/><br/>Again, if the top two rows apply to you, then you will wish you had listened to this warning.<br/><br/>Are you thinking ""this person is some kind of pro critic or really picky about movies, I just want to see what happened after T2""?<br/><br/>No, I am not a professional critic, and I'm probably not more picky about movies than you. And yes, I sure wanted to see what happened after T2. But you see, you do not get to see what happened after T2, because the people responsible for that excellent script did not touch a page of this movie. It is entirely different. The company which made T2, Corolco, didn't produce this movie. Cameron did not co-write nor produce this movie.<br/><br/>T3 is riddled with large caliber logic and story holes, many things don't add up and contradict the ""Terminator world"". The cast is really ill chosen, the T-X technology a bit too much for me, but the bottom line is that it doesn't have much of a story. Many movies don't actually need one, take ""Deep Blue Sea"" for instance, great entertainment without the need of a solid story. But the T movies already have a very cool story with, mostly, down-to-earth technology involved. Advanced, but mostly believable, and this goes for design also, the whole ""make it look cool"" clause from the first T2 book was very appealing to me as I enjoy things which look nice but also look practical enough to pass as a believable design. T3's tech and design is a bit different, clearly shown with both with the T-X and hardware in the 2029 scenes.<br/><br/>Let me make it blatantly clear what we are talking about here. This will be fully understood by fans of the Aliens saga. I rank T3 as marginally better than ""Alien : Resurrection"", a movie which corrupted and devastated the the beloved Aliens saga. This statement will allow you to make your own references. If you liked ""Aliens : Resurrection"" and thought it to be a worthy follow-up to the earlier movies, then you will most probably love T3. If you on the other hand wish it had never come to exist, then you get an idea of my views on T3.<br/><br/>I remember going to see ""Alien 3"" many years ago, I then expected something even better and more advanced than the prequel before it, I was utterly disappointed due to it not measuring up to my expectations. In retrospect, Alien 3 isn't really that bad, just different. I wish I could say the same for T3. I came to the theatre expecting something bad, due to numerous reviews, the intel of T3's budget problems and a script without Cameron. All of this negativity made me confident T3 would come out on top, seeing how I expected so little of it. But the disappointment was devastating. The worst part is that T3 has become a comedy, a quick action movie with dry jokes and one-liners accompanied with solid special effects. The movie mocks the previous two movies and tries to play the same jokes, whereas it comes out as a sad experience. Even the Terminators aren't really the same anymore, they are much more human, with facial expressions and logics that robots would never apply. The whole ""machine syndrome"" isn't apparent at all, which is one of the really nice things about T2, this ""man beside machine, examining the differences and similarities of her creation.""<br/><br/>While T2's story was excellent, it had something else, call it ""storytelling""; the ability to tell a story in a flowing manner with scenes that logically follow eachother and keeps the viewer interested. This technique is one of the prime things that makes T2 excel and the prime thing that makes T3 crash and burn. The viewer is presented with scenes which appear to be cut together, where most are action scenes and the other scenes are dry humor. Humor will vary greatly between people, but as a preview of what to expect, I must say that a joke which was funny when Joe Pesci said it in Lethal Weapon 3, is certainly not funny 2003.<br/><br/>I do apologize for the constant comparisons with Terminator and T2, such references do not belong in a review, but I felt it was needed so everyone reading this can examine my views on the previous movies and compare it with their own views. Without references that one can relate to, a review or criticism is simply an incomprehendable description from which it is difficult to form an opinion on.<br/><br/>In truth, I do not want you to see T3. Yes, you will be one of the few on the planet who didn't see T3, but then again you will be one of the few people who has untainted, glorious memories of the first two movies. No one can change that."

","When I went to the theatre to see ""Terminator 3"" I wasn't expecting much. They waited so long to make it and the commercials didn't make it look that great. However, when the credits rolled I was very impressed. It was a very entertaining film with a good story line and ending. I liked it how before The Terminator (Arnold) was crushed he said he would be seeing John again. Thats what I like about the Terminator, it has to deal with the future. Now I thought the fact that judgement day did come in the end was a good idea. They couldn't just copy the end of Terminator 2 so they had to change it. They changed it well. Though in the narration of John Connor John says: ""When I was 13 years old"" (obviously reflecting on Terminator 2) they had got it wrong. It is clear that it says on the screen of the computer screen that T1000 uses: John Connor 10 years old. I think they people who made the movie were too lazy to actually watch the movie and check so they just got how old the actor was who played John (13). But, this movie did keep my attention very well and I give it an 8/10. It is out of theatres now but I reccomend renting it on video/dvd. Its worth your money..."

"psi_fla","Null","0","0","6 September 2003"," They're back
","Rating: *** (out of *****)<br/><br/>Yes, they're back. The franchise that produced two excellent instalments in the late 20th century has returned. I had high hopes for Terminator 3 before I entered the cinema, mainly because of good reviews, a good trailer and enjoyment of the first two films in the series (which many hold anyway).<br/><br/>The build-up is momentous as we begin in the present day with John Connor (now played by In the Bedroom's Nick Stahl) narrating about the current state of affairs. His account reveals that despite the ending of Terminator 2, in which all of us believed that Sarah Connor had prevented judgement day (she hasn't, as we soon discover), he fears for the future and lives with no one knowing who he is or where he comes from. These fears are realised when Skynet sends the T-X (Kristanna Loken), a seemingly unstoppable terminator in female guise, back in time to eliminate him and all his future lieutenants, which include vet Kate Brewster (an underused Claire Danes). Fortunately, John has protection as well, in the form of the now obsolete T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger). <br/><br/>When a story like this begins unfolding, beginning with a rather fine chase scene, you feel that you're in for something special. And indeed, the elements for a very good film are all in place. For example, the actors, even Arnold, are at their best. Yes, the big man is exceptionally good as the now obsolete T-101. Every one of his lines is either funny or convincing. Kristanna Loken, despite having very few lines, gets her job done effectively, intentionally imitating Robert Patrick at times (I say `intentionally' for the T-X can be seen as an enhanced T-1000 with an endoskeleton and a few more interesting enhancements).<br/><br/>
The plot's generally thin, but when it does get theoretical, it's generally convincing. Director Jonathan Mostow may not be James Cameron, but he definitely knows how to update the Terminator for the new millennium. Some of T3's action scenes are real stand outs in this year's crowd of summer films, and there are some major new plot developments. But it's here where the film begins to fall a bit flat. <br/><br/>These new plot developments are touched on but left unexplored. There are several plot holes and the time shifts are inconsistent. And while there's no doubt that a lot of care was put into the opening chase, the final scenes seemed to be resolved far too easily. The first two Terminator films had open endings that could be conclusions as well as leave room for possible sequels. This one appears to be almost entirely dependent on a T4 (and box office returns seem to have ensured that, but...), especially as the film ends a little too abruptly. If T3 had a little more substance then I could definitely have recommended it to everyone. <br/><br/>Still, T3 still offers a good time at the movies in its own right, even if it isn't the perfect summer blockbuster (if you're looking for that, try Pirates of the Caribbean)."
"Lamerzi","Null","0","0","1 September 2003"," It couldn't possibly live up to T1 & T2
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>After the now classic first two films, we have this largely pointless sequel. I fear it was made only for financial reasons and the absence of James Cameroon shows this. After a twelve year wait, I think the makers could have done better than this.<br/><br/>My main concern was the lack of explanation as to how Skynet was developed. After Dyson was killed in T2 and his work destroyed, I think we deserved to have a more thought-out development of this ""re-birth"" of the Skynet AI. The development of Skynet in T3 was rushed and contradicts the time-line we learned in the first films.<br/><br/>The overall ethos I so admired in T2 is lacking here. More than anything, T2 gave us hope for the future: that it is NOT in our nature to kill ourselves. Now here in T3 we learn Judgment Day ""is inevitable"".<br/><br/>The absence of Linda Hamilton also made this film suffer. When we learn of Sarah's death it is empty and unsatisfying.<br/><br/>While it was a enjoyable ""action"" film with some good characters and set-pieces, I feel overall the tone and story are inferior to the well loved T1 & T2. The ending was an anti-climax and seems only fit for setting up the possibilities of more and more sequels (probably of diminishing quality).<br/><br/>I will finish by saying that in the official Making of Terminator 2 documentary I watched yesterday, T2 was described as ""The Conclusion"". I rest my case."
"mnl-2","Null","0","0","1 September 2003"," It starts off badly
","It starts off badly.<br/><br/>Call me an old romantic, but I like my Arnie films violent and bloody. Terminator 3 has a 12A certificate.  Suddenly I'd worked out how so many under-10s had managed to cajole the cinema's ticket sellers: the occasional head and shoulders that I could see in front of me belonged to the requisite accompanying adult.  I had horrible visions that one of the best sci-fi franchises was about to be watered down like RoboCop had been on the dreadful TV series (where the Future of Law Enforcement, rather than shoot between the eyes, prefers so shoot a table leg, which causes an unsuspecting vase to lose its balance and fall on the head of the Bad Guy).<br/><br/>Taking over director duties from James Cameron is U-571's Jonathan Mostow (a minus), Nick Stahl takes over the central-character-of-John-Connor duties from Edward Furlong (probably a plus), the Austrian OakT looks good for a man in his 50s and into the mix is thrown John Connor's love interest, Kate Brewster, played by Claire Danes.<br/><br/>Plot wise, T3's is essentially the same as T2's.  A bad terminator has been sent back in time by the baddies (the machines) to kill the goodies (humans) before they become important future leaders in the future war between goodies and baddies.  The goodies have therefore sent back a good terminator (Arnie) to protect the future leaders from the bad terminator.<br/><br/>The latest model of terminator is the T-X, played by former model Kristanna Loken and, according to the law of sequels, the baddie is contractually obliged to be more deadly that its predecessor... well, that's the idea. Loken's portrayal of a robot killing machine isn't too bad at all, even though at one point she does resort to making turns 90º at a time, however she is somewhat let down by her terminator.  In T2, the top of the range terminator was made of liquid metal (which meant that it was effectively impossible snap in two) and could cleverly change shape to look like anyone he/she wanted.  The scriptwriters, not wishing to lose that useful plot device, have made sure that the T-X can do this too.  The difference is that underneath the liquid metal is a robot which, although near indestructible, does mean the ""terminatrix"" does have an Achilles heel.  On the plus side, the manufactures have built-in some weapons and what appears to be the entire Maplin catalogue.  The latter enables her to hack into and then control any computer.  In fact, it turns out that the only thing she doesn't have is a built-in mobile phone or radio; these manufacturers need their heads banging together!<br/><br/>Which leads us nicely onto the first action scene.  T-X enters into a car chase with heroes by driving 12-wheel articulated crane while remote controlling two police cars and an ambulance and dealing with Arnie swinging from the end of the crane hook.  Crashing through buildings, cars exploding, skidding across people's lawns - fantastic!  The scene's good enough to overlook the fact that the cars that T-X has hacked into aren't controlled by computer override, but instead by the pedals and steering wheel moving themselves.  All that was missing was Michael Knight.<br/><br/>It's not just the plot that's the same as T2, so are the gags.  Arnie gets to use his catchphrases, we get to laugh at a naked Arnie stealing clothes from a camp stripper in the middle of his act, Arnie likes wearing sunglasses, etc.  Make no mistake, the star of the show is Arnie.  And he's been given much more to actually do this time round.  Almost without exception, this a mistake.<br/><br/>One of the great things about T2 on DVD is the extended version where they flick the switch that enables Arnie to learn.  Indeed, this would have been an interesting theme to explore.  The central theme of T3 is destiny, and that there's nothing we can do to avoid it.  Of course, this allows for this sequel, because the rationale is that although they thought they'd successfully changed the future at the end of T2, in fact they hadn't. This is crudely worked into the script.  For me, John Connor's and Kate Brewster's realisation and easy acceptance of the ideas of time travel and destiny (including the fate that they're meant to be together) weakens their characters.  I think that John Connor's speech would have been better used telling it to Kate rather than to the audience as the opening monologue.<br/><br/>So, is it better than T2?  No.  Of course, that would have been hard. Some things are better (the hydrogen fuel cells, T-X being able to DNA test by licking blood, seeing the wobbly first model terminators), many things are the same (losing the roof of a car by driving under something too low), but too many things are worse (Arnie not measuring body count to one decimal place, the pointless cameo by Dr Silberman, the conveniently-timed failings of the bad terminator, use of liquid metal shape changing special effects, the fact that you only get the signature tune on the end credits and many more besides).<br/><br/>Still a bit of a laugh, though.  I'm looking forward to T4 already."
"sim4ward","Null","0","0","3 September 2003"," Stale Recipe
","Ever tried to cook something, following the same recipe faithfully, only to have it turn out different every time? Apparently the makers of this movie had no such problems. The standard ingredients are all present, in pretty much the same quantities, from Terminator 2, and voila! the results are startlingly similar, and the plot is similarly half-baked. But this is not brain food. This is a Terminator sequel.<br/><br/>Some of the ingredients are better, it's true. Fx have come a long way even since T2, and there has been some attempt at least to spice up some of the chase and fight sequences a bit, with Terminators being dragged through collapsing buildings, crushed under vehicles and so on all pretty convincingly and generally spectacularly. As you'd expect, with so much of the production team's focus on fx and stunts, the story seems even more sadly neglected than previously - like a cake that has been left out in the rain far too long.<br/><br/>We're introduced to the T-X (the thoroughly gorgeous Kristanna Loken) and informed that she is an anti-Terminator Terminator. Wow. Impressive. Except, well, she spends an entire movie demonstrating that she is completely unable to take out an obsolete T-101. Show, don't tell, they say, is the rule of good story telling. So why couldn't we at least have been treated to the sight of several Arnie-class Terminators turning up, all to get pulped by this little lady - except of course for our 'hero'? Oh well, missed opportunity there guys, but don't worry, you only spent a few million dollars on your movie, so no great loss.<br/><br/>Anyway, this metallic minx battles Arnie (unsuccessfully) across the city, destroying much of said city in the process and these two Terminator models break into into their constituent components faster than a girl and boy band respectively. Arnie gets to fire at the cops without hurting any of them, the bad Terminatrix gets to kill a few people, morph into other people, and check her hair in the occasional reflective surface. The temporal mechanics of the story are about as well-crafted as the prototype Terminators that look like a cross between vehicle assembly line robots and that mechanical monstrosity from the Lost in Space movie. In a final desperate flight, young John Connor and his girlfriend are handed a particle accelerator to effect their getaway and it's all a bit convenient and sloppy in the plotting department. All of which culminates in what is a predictable climax that, I think, badly wanted to be a 'clever twist'. Unfortunately, you can't have a clever twist in a circular plot, generally speaking, because otherwise the ends won't meet.<br/><br/>For all the metal flying around, the performances are surprisingly wooden, even from the human contingent. And Arnie, sending himself up, is playing a caricature of a machine and you can almost hear the gears grinding. Or is that your teeth?<br/><br/>Only Kristanna Loken escapes too much criticism in this department, because after all we all forgave Arnie the first time out, when we generally thought, hey, he was pretty good in the Terminator, only to realise later that a machine incapable of expression was all he was cut out to play with any degree of credibility. So the jury is still out on Ms Loken's general acting ability, and she certainly has a screen presence that is always welcome.<br/><br/>In fact, she is the one ingredient in the Terminator 3 recipe that could definitely be described as yummy. And if that sounds at all shallow, it's probably because I eventually discovered the best level on which any of this unsatisfactory hokum can be enjoyed."

The plot is straight, nothing difficult to understand, and I think that the main point is that the dudgment day was inevitable, it was something that could only be postponed for some time...

"Jenny Ho","8","0","0","2 September 2003"," Exceeds what one might expect from a sequel
","The story will be familiar to followers of the series so far: a cyborg killing machine is sent back in time from a future where machines rule the Earth, to eliminate John Connor, the future rebel leader and saviour of humanity.  At the same time, a good Terminator' in the form of a T-101 model (i.e. Schwarzenegger) is sent back with the mission to keep Connor alive for the day when the Skynet system is due to launch its first attack on humanity.  This may sound mostly like a tiresome rerun of  Terminator 2' but apparently, Sarah and John Connor did not prevent Judgment Day in Terminator 2' they only postponed it!  Also, the twist and selling point here, is that this time the baddie' is T-X, a female supermodel Terminator' which is far superior to the T-101 (an obsolete model').<br/><br/>Of the original main cast, only Arnie is back; Sarah Connor is dead as Linda Hamilton did not want to star in another sequel and Edward Furlong has been replaced by Nick Stahl to play John Connor.  Another new face to the cast is Claire Danes who gives an appealing performance as the suitably bewildered and vulnerable girl destined to be John Connor's wife.  With a delay of twelve years since T2 Judgment Day' was released, Schwarzenegger's career on the decline and him revisiting the role for a third instalment, there is obviously a lot of pressure on this one to deliver the goods, and it certainly does.  <br/><br/>Schwarzenegger is key to much of the fun of the film; his delivery of one-liners with robotic seriousness and Austrian accent is superb.  As a result, I found the film hilarious in parts.  At the start of the film, there is a re-run of two cyborgs being zapped back from the future nude and this makes for one of the funniest scenes in the film where a naked Arnie strides into Ladies night at a bar to be mistaken for a stripper by the raucous attendees.  He then steals the stage dancer's leather biker costume before trying on his star-shaped shades he off course soon ditches these for the by now familiar and way cooler black shades!  <br/><br/>A lot of excitement is to be had from the film's action set-pieces and chases and this is down to the relentlessness of the T-X who like her predecessor, can shape herself into another human being and pull herself back together whatever gun you use to shoot at her.  Surprisingly, the ending is affecting as it reflects the inevitability of Connor's future role as a leader despite his reluctance to believe throughout.  Also, (I actually feel a bit silly for admitting it) I was unexpectedly moved by the scene where the T-101 struggles to override the corruption that the T-X has implanted in his program so that he alternates between conflicting missions of killer/protector of John Connor.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I didn't totally get the plot and was a bit lost with regards the references to the Skynet system.  However, if you just go with the flow and don't think too much about the story, Terminator 3 makes for undemanding entertainment."

Yes, it's true. Terminator 3 isn't as good as either of the first two. The story has some weaknesses and some of the acting (mainly Stahl and Danes) isn't that great. Nevertheless, Arnold is terrific, the action is outstanding (especially the crane scene) and the ending is certainly memorable. I'm glad I took the time to watch it.

"stamper","8","0","0","1 September 2003"," With the creator of the series gone, what is left of an epic story
","Many people, including I were very doubtful Terminator 3 would amount to anything, after the departure of James Cameron from the project. Other blows for fans of the series were that neither Edward Furlong nor Linda Hamilton would show up for the sequel and that not even William Wisher (who co-wrote both of the previous films wrote anything for this one). Instead the writers were people of little fame and the  director was not too famous as well, only having had a small hit' called U-571 in the year 2000 (grossing over 100 Million Dollars world-wide). The only comfort for the doubtful (such as I), was that Mario Kassar (producer of T2) and Gale Anne Hurd (producer and co-creator of The Terminator and producer of T2) were attached to the project as producers. It took a quite a time to cast T3 and it left me with mixed feelings. First it was said that Famke Janssen (the best Bond-girl ever) was to play the TerminatriX, but she turned it down. Then Edward Furlong was not going to be present as John Connor. By then I'd given up hope, that this could ever work. Then they cast Nick Stahl, who I extremely liked in Bully, as the new' John Connor and Claire Danes (of Romeo + Juliet fame) was cast as well. This looked more promising, but sold I wasn't. The trailer came along and I liked it pretty much, but still I stayed away from the big cinema and awaited the Terminators arrival at our local cinema. When he came I went, and when I left, I left satisfied.<br/><br/>
Terminator 3 starts out with a great spoken intro by John Connor and then delves deeply into matter with which all Terminator fans are well accustomed too: Terminators arriving on earth after being sent back in time, desperately in the need of clothes. This is what all Terminator films start with and this though this one does so with a different type of approach. In the first part of the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a good one-liner after another and the action scenes are predominant (as they remain for the bigger part of the film). The one-liners are not always funny because of what is said, but because of the way it is said in and the facial expression Arnold makes when he utters the remarks. The action scenes are enormous and nothing short of spectacular (which is something I do not say easily, since I've seen a lot of action on film). This, along with some surprises in the story, are what keeps you on the edge of you seat for the ride and the only thing that could be considered drawback in this film, is the fact that the action sequences are too dominant at times.<br/><br/>
But what about the times, when there are no action scenes? What about the acting? Well, Arnie was as good as ever in his role as the almost indestructible Terminator (although his last few lines were corny and almost overshadowed his entire performance). Claire Danes did an ok job and Nick Stahl was adequate as the new John Connor. Kristina Loken was ok as the T-X, but at times I felt that more could have done with her. Maybe they could have made more use of her looks and maybe they could have made her act a little less than the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) in T2. But hey, if everything was good, that would be the perfect scenario and hence, the perfect film! Whenever did you see that one?<br/><br/>
Another drawback of the film manifests itself toward the end. There seems to be a desperate attempt by the makers of the film, to make Arnold say some memorable lines as he did in The Terminator and T2. I hate to say it, but they fall flat and almost ruin the ending. I said almost! Because when you think almost everything is done and the rest of the story is obvious, there is one surprise left for John and Kate (Claire Danes) and this is, what makes the film really worth while. Those last seven minutes or so, when John and Kate are on their own and when once again, there is a spoken part. That part only (together with the spoken intro) is worth the price admission. Really well done! The finishing touch comes with Brad Fiedel's theme, which I so dearly missed in the beginning of the film. Why oh why did they not play it at the beginning as well??? All in all this is good effort and the slightly worse' rating in comparison to The Terminator and T2 only stems from Arnold's last one-liners and the fact that this was more of a summer popcorn flick than were the other two.<br/><br/>

"jaywolfenstien","Null","0","0","26 August 2003"," T3: Marketable Sequel?
","It's almost tradition for each sequel in an entry to slip from its roots and drift more and more into the realms of comedy. It's also tradition for the scope to expand to make it ""bigger"" and ""better."" This is most apparent in the horror genre where sequels are in abundance, meanwhile comedy sequels just become more and more mindless. The Terminator franchise also follows this trend.<br/><br/>While I'm certainly not against easing up on the tension every now and again with well placed humor, T3 fails to capture the essence of its apocalyptic predecessors and convince me that it is, indeed, a Terminator film. In T2, Cameron managed to maintain the fact we still deal with machines even if our model 101 killing machine is spouting the occasional Connor-taught one liners. While I liked some of the humor, I didn't much care for quite a bit of it but I won't go into detail on which instances bugged me.<br/><br/>While I'm not against the film due to the lack of the original talent, either Mostow was too eager to create an homage to Cameron's past entries and cluttered the screen with too much homage and too little film or the studio wanted him to re-create someone elses work. I'll give Mostow the benefit of the doubt because I feel somewhere in T3 there's a truly excellent film screaming to get out, but not a Cameron film-a Mostow film. It feels too much like a fish out of water for me to truly enjoy all the way.<br/><br/>Though I have to say, I was happy to find a third Marco Beltrami score that I liked. While Fiedel's original scores were not the absolute greatest scores in the world, Termniator does have a very distinct musical signature to it and a very well done main theme. I won't rush out and buy this Terminator score any time soon, Beltrami does bring an interesting traditional scoring presence to Fiedel's synthetic creations and does follow along in similar veins even if I really didn't like the orchestral rendition of the Terminator main theme, itself.<br/><br/>Like the previously released Matrix 2, T3 suffers from action in excess. It has me worried about the future of action films, actually. As action packed and high tech as these chases are, I find myself yawning from boredom along the tail end of them. Let's face it, we've seen all of this before. Different vehicles, different special effects techniques, but we've seen our share of car chases/gun fights/action scenes . . . making them longer is not going to make them more interesting. I wonder what director will be the first to direct the very first film composed solely of one action scene? Hmm.<br/><br/>I found myself also making the mistake of asking too many questions like ""If the T-X has power over other machines, why didn't she utilize it more?"" or ""Why doesn't she use her cannon to blow up the good guys right there?"" I didn't find the T-X too terribly intriguing since they made her so advanced and so much more powerful than anything the good guys could throw at her - I couldn't see how the film would last more than 20 minutes if she utilized her advantages most efficiently, which, realistically, is how Skynet would program her.<br/><br/>The T-1000 concept was a much better idea. He was still very limited, but did he ever take advantage of what he -could- do. He used his mimetic-poly-alloy attributes to the fullest in some of the coolest on-screen displays. <br/><br/>The on screen rise of the machines I could have lived without, unmasking Skynet was a mistake because 1) Skynet's explanation was unbelievable and 2) the previously unseen, mysterious entity, now has a face and form. <br/><br/>The images of global genocide by atomic weaponry had negligible power - Gary Larson drew Far Side comic strips with the same imagery. The scope T3 went for and how it executed it deadened the total impact. Cameron had it right by keeping things off Skynet, itself, and keeping the rise of the machines isolated to one perspective. He kept the camera down on earth where the war would tug hardest: on everyday people. Atomic detonation from the perspective of orbit shows the destruction of land masses, and leaves the billions destined to die to be written off in an abstract paraphrase where a full thesis is needed - it's the cliffnotes to the novel, and not the words of the artist, himself. <br/><br/>Like many sequels, T3 disappointed me because it failed to realize less is more. I didn't hate T3, and I didn't think it sucked. Were it not a part of the Terminator universe, it'd be a decent action flick (and it still is a decent action flick inside the T-universe) . . . but it's the standardized, market-driven Terminator movie that lacks the vision and craft of its predecessors."

It promises another movie: the one telling the story about the ultimate victory.<br/><br/>8) No resurrection of Linda Hamilton, and<br/><br/>9) the absence of the wide-eyed-teenage-boy-wow-! element.<br/><br/>10) No unnecessarily 'noble' characters. Just people who do what turn out to be very stupid things for reasons which are perfectly valid to them. (This is known as 'life' and thus believable.)<br/><br/>11) The transition for the stereotypical notion of the 'mainframe'/hardware-based Skynet to the 'distributed', software-based kind (a transition symbolizing that from the industrial revolution into the information age) was a touch of genius, and provided a neat rationale for the theme of this movie.<br/><br/>Note:<br/><br/>If AS becomes governor and canna do T4, it doesn't matter. Actually I hope he won't be able to do it. Stahl and Danes are quite suited to the job. It'll be a different story, but so what? It may be a _better_ story, and, for that matter, it might actually give the whole series a proper closure.<br/><br/>I just hope they make the T4 story consistent. It won't be easy to convince me how a few straggly humans defeat a huge army of machines, all of whom operate without a centralized 'command'.

","I've watched this movie while enduring a terrible headache. Not that I'd want you to jump to any conclusions; it wasn't because of Schwarzenegger. It was because I had seen the sequel to Charlie's Angels(though I haven't seen the original). I might comment on that another time, but just so you know: it's bad.<br/><br/>I guess The Terminator is one of this years ""hits"", at least regarding the popularity. Too bad you can't see it now in California, as Arnold is doing his new act. I feared much before this movie, but I can say my fears have been allayed. It wasn't as bad as it could've been; actually it was rather good. <br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Some might have noticed this(or maybe not): I tend to put that ""spoilers"" thingy every time and I don't tell when they end. My way of reviewing actually involves few spoilers, but sometimes, for the film's sake, I just have to put some in...and I definitely don't want any trouble with ""the big guys"" from wonderful imdb. <br/><br/>First of all I am impressed by how Arnie has kept in shape! Seriously now, he really does still look like the Terminator we all knew. He cam, he saw, he terminated; that's how I'd call his part. I like Arnold, always have, and I certainly like him more than Stallone or Van Damme. He's just more interesting to watch. All talk very little, but Schwarzenegger did sometimes defy this ""custom"". He is the symbol of the movies and always will be, though the true center should actually be lain, story wise, on the future leader of the human race: John Connor. Nick Stahl does a good job to look like a desperate man, certainly not at as a leader, but he starts being what he will be towards the end. I liked the idea that the woman is always behind the man: quite was here. Nice Clare Danes, too. Miss Kristanna ""TX"" Loken was, of course, the ""big newcomer"". I can't say that I liked her more than the previous terminator. Actually, I liked her less. But if that's what we got, we have to live with her, and I certainly would. <br/><br/>The story is somewhat more complex than I expected and the ending really did take me quite off guard. It was certainly the best way the film could've ended so that it would've been good. A ""human win all"" scenario would've been more disappointing. Story wise it is good. <br/><br/>What the main problem is? Somewhat expected I believe: similar scenes involving the terminators with the previous movies. The action was very enjoyable, a lot of cars blown up, a lot of people gunned down, stuff like that, but all in all enjoyable. Good direction I'd say, better than expected. Might have been something else with Cameron, but...this was destiny! Almost reminded me of The Matrix towards the end.<br/><br/>
Just go and see it. It's a nice flick. If you liked the first two, I don't really see why you shouldn't like this one. A healthy 8/10. Oh, I almost forgot. Did you wonder about the title? Well, if you'll see the movie you might just get your answer."

It wasn't just the holes in the script , some of them gaping. Didn't bother me. Way I see it there  really shouldn't be a sequel to Part II ; it was too perfect for that. So the only way to link it with this sequel was to blow the script wide open.<br/><br/>
It wasn't the horrendous error in the casting of Nick Stahl in the role of John Connor either. This young man is simply in the wrong business ; he lacks any trace of personal charisma and charm a Hollywood actor should have. His casting in what is essentially the lead role in a multi-million dollar production is bizarre to say the least. The only time I was satisfied with him being in the frame was when Arnie got his hands around his throat and lifted him clear off the floor. Right there and then, if he would have wasted him the movie would have taken a twist in the right direction and broken through all that was expected from the script. But he didn't :-(<br/><br/>
Neither was the incredible naivity of the dialogs nor screenplay what blew it for me . You kinda shake the bad impression off when a frightened young woman downs what looks like a menacing small jet with an AK-47; OK so the Russians paid for some commercial exposure too. Why should only the Fins from Nokia be the smart ones and benefit from some ' gray ' advertising?<br/><br/>
The main sticking points for me ( and boy was I surprised from that ) were actually the only signs of intelligence this movie tried to show.<br/><br/>
The most obvious was of course the ending. Just as we are ready for the final showdown  ,the mother of all battles , a glimpse of the monster itself ,  there's a tremendous let down with everything ending in a dusted place which looks forgotten from history with some AM radio broadcasts announcing the end of the world. I suppose with this the writers tried to show some originality. Originality is good. I've loved originality in all the mini sci-fi and horror series. But you know what? This is not a one-hour special episode of some TV series. This is a major blockbuster movie with fans of the original storyline and heroes who came to see the End coming as the proverbial Mack truck running clear through the screens. But this film doesn't End. It just fades away like a wounded animal that no one would put out of it's misery.<br/><br/>
That was the first thought after the film. But something deeper bothered me as well. The sour taste in my mouth somehow expanded in my mind as well. There was a message somewhere in there as well , hidden , lurking.<br/><br/>
Then it dawned on me ; what's the real difference between the second and the third Terminator ? It's the outlook of the Future. In Terminator II Linda Hamilton conveys a positive message ; Future is what we make of it. But here in the third part there's a much darker message: Future is inevitable. And the Future is the clash with the Machine . The Machine is our enemy and no matter what, it shall one day turn on us. So be afraid. Be very afraid. Dig some holes in your back yard. Stock up on supplies. Get some guns. Cause the reckoning is coming. And it doesn't matter that there are no enemies are left. It doesn't matter that the threat is not there any more ( parallel with the empty, dusted , obsolete nuke shelter ) There's a reason always for keeping a stockpile ready to blow the world up: It's there to be used and we'll use it on ourselves. And if you aren't afraid of the Russians anymore , if the aliens are nowhere to be found then don't worry. Look into your study , into your children's rooms, into your workspace. The Enemy is there , disguised , dormant , posing as a friend. Till it's time for Him to rise and destroy us all. But the Leader will emerge from the rubble with his few chosen saved by the rat holes they have dug for themselves. And he'll gather his few chosen ones and fly the American flag again ( as the tell-tale scene of the future in the beginning goes )<br/><br/>
Well guess again Mr Director ,Producer and Writer. Cause the flag you have waving there shouldn't stand for fear and an Army of One.<br/><br/>Although there's plenty of folk out there who'd like that..."

","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen. How dare they destroy what had gone before.<br/><br/>First of all it seems to have turned into an action-comedy film, at times the humour is almost slapstick, this means that the suspense of the first two has been completely removed. Our new female terminator friend was lacking. I can't quite put my finger on it but I didn't 'fear' this one. What about the action? We were promised spectacular action scenes and I suppose some were quite good but when you're not enjoying a film they tend to get a bit boring after a while.<br/><br/>If I was forced to say something nice about this film then I would have to say that the ending is good (and not just because the film was now over) but mainly because it was unexpected. I am, however, a little concerned about the prospect of a sequel. Even though I suppose it would HAVE to be better than this. <br/><br/>Now that I've got all that off my chest I'm going to go and sit down and watch the first two installments and try to forget that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines ever happened."

T3 is an average movie with some good action sequences. The dialogue, acting and plot development are all about standard for a no-brainer summer blockbuster. At least we're spared the patronising and clumsy moralising of T2, and thank God the odious little Edward Furlong has been binned. What lifted this film above mediocrity was its surprisingly downbeat ending. In contrast to the vomit-inducing sentimentality of T2, this had quite a creepy finish, and sets the franchise up well for the next installment. Having said that though, it's maybe time to put the series to bed. Arnie's past it, and if his Terminator opponents were to become any more advanced it would just be silly."
"thecygnet","Null","0","0","26 August 2003"," Dated but enjoyable action movie - a guilty pleasure.
","My father did not like it. He says it was dull. I would rather say it is dated. <br/><br/>In our times, when non-characteristic, sensitive and fallible movie heroes are on the top of the box-office charts (e.g. Spiderman, Harry Potter, Frodo, the X-Men or Neo) this 100% macho point of view seems awfully dated. I know, we have seen Arnold playing this kind of ""sensitive hero"" (End of Days, The 6th Day, Collateral Damage) and the result was horrible. At least, this time he is back in the form and does what he can. And he is quite good and believable.<br/><br/>This film has been late for at least 6 or 7 years. I heard about the fights over the rights but this does not change my opinion. I do not think that James Cameron could have made a much better movie out of this material - probably it would seem to be dated, as well.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I have to say it is a hugely enjoyable action movie. I am not a die hard fan of the first two Terminator movies so I was able to sit back and enjoy the ride and forget criticism. The best thing about this movie is that it knows its boundaries: it is nothing else but an entertaining summer action movie with a straightforward, not so subtle opinion about the connection between humanity and technology. I think that everything has already been said about this connection in Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: a space odyssey"". <br/><br/>The special effects are first rate but not revolutionary. But why should they be? This race between the recent action movies in order to create never-before-seen special effects is useless and senseless. After a time the result is laughable. Often the reliable formula can be much more entertaining. And the third Terminator movie belongs to this group.<br/><br/>
It is also a good thing that the end of the movie is different from the majority of Hollywood action movies - at least it is not a flag-waving finale.<br/><br/>But there are disadvantages, as well: I think with the help of much more irony this could be a funnier (and better) movie. Arnold's first scene at the chippendale bar is the kind of thing I think of. Too bad that they did not follow that line. I also expected some character development in the case of human characters. All in all, it can be an entertaining movie if you do not have great expectations."

The movie has a great start and some great and funny ideas. the major problems are tough: Nick Stahl is not a good john connor. He turned into a wussie! He is not that young man with a lot of courage that he was in T2. And back then he was 13 years old! Claire Danes plays a scream queen and I can't beleive that the fate of manking would depend on her. The T-X seems to me not as dangerous as the T2 altough she should be more dangerous, but the T-1000 made a more dangerous impression, hard to say why. The movie lacks also in terms of sound. Sound is 50% of the experience and many action sequences have just no music or not good music, it takes away part of the experience. James Cameron knows very well how to use the sound, Mostow now. What doesn't make sense that this T-800 is not the same as he was in T2, yet he refuses to kill humans, how should he know not to do that? I also think it's stupid of Mostow to show an American flag in the movie. Nothing against USA, but this is a human vs. machines movie, it's the world united against the machines, it's just plain stupid to show flags. But I'm not surprised as Mostow claimed in U-571 that the americans captured Enigma, while it actually were the Britisch. T3 has a good start but becomes more and more boring and not very well layed out. Too bad James Cameron and Edward Furlong didn't participate, I'm sure it could have been way better."

","I am a big fan of the Terminator franchise. I think T1 was brilliant, while T2 was an excellent sequel. That being said, I had very low expectations for the T3 film: there was no James Cameron, no Edward Furlong, the trailers were suprisingly unimpressive and I simply didn't think there should even be a sequel, since T2 seemed so conclusive.<br/><br/>What I did get was something maybe worse than a bad movie: an unfulfilled potential.<br/><br/>The special FX are OK, not impressive, but it should be noted that the bar is extremely high for the FX, so one can't expect to be blown away as easily as in, say, 1991. Kristanna Loken is a good T-X, Claire Danes is a solid addition and Nick Stahl is good enough not to think about Furlong.<br/><br/>What surprised me the most is that the story actually made sense. There really was room for this sequel to be made, and the ending really showed that T3 had the potential to be an excellent exclamation point to the Terminator series. However, it didn't go that way. Mostow's direction is simply not suitable for the Terminator atmosphere. Action sequences look as in any recent blockbuster, the jokes simply are out of place and there is no 'dark' feeling the previous 2 movies had. It seems as Mostow simply didn't take this movie serious enough to make it as good as it could have been.<br/><br/> In the end, I couldn't say T3 is a bad movie, but it simply should have been much, much better.

","It's a shame, this movie started off so well, and with so much promise, despite the concern as to the absence of James Cameron, I thought the plot looked good and Arnie was back.<br/><br/>However, it really quickly turned into a joke of a Terminator movie. Not much brooding terror as the Terminator entered the present day again; comic laughs were played for from the outset. Surely Leslie Nielson was due in at any second?<br/><br/>Saying that, there were some of the original elements still there, the darkness; the downside to the story; the future twist that was yet to happen and you'd probably never see, and the human moments while the excitement was still thick in the air. Unfortunately, many of these were just swept over quickly in short bursts of dialogue to make way for another huge set piece.<br/><br/>Not that the set pieces weren't amazing, it's just that by the end of the film, you feel that it was almost all a collection of set pieces. The audience was hardly given time to digest the shocking revelation from the Terminator, nor did any of the characters discuss it before heading off into the fight again.<br/><br/>The other thing that hit me were the completely corny moments, two in particular stand out, the chance meeting of John Connor and his old school chum. How amazing was that considering that John Connor continually keeps moving and never stays in the same place? Then there was the need for the new Terminator to announce her findings of the DNA sampling to absolutely no one, despite the audience having already seen them flashed across her computer enhanced vision. American audiences I assume.<br/><br/>In fact, the new Terminator isn't that scary or foreboding, and often she looks clumsy and awkward. Not a patch on the Terminator in T3, in fact none of the characters live up to their predecessors.<br/><br/>I have heard talk of more sequels. I can only pray that James Cameron is out there, reading these, having watched the film, and decides he can't let the series be butchered again. Make another one, finish the series off and do it well Mr Cameron!"

","In 1991 T2 was a sociological and technological touchstone; CGI came of age, morphing became the subject of water-cooler conversations and a generation of aspiring artists (myself included) augmented pencil and paper with a graphics tablet. This breakthrough paved the way for the Jurassic Park franchise and, perhaps controversially, the Star Wars prequels.<br/><br/>Jonathan Mostow (U-571), conscious that the bar was raised too high on T2, saliently leverages James Cameron's legacy and designs a thunderous rollercoaster ride that deftly mixes sci-fi and slasher genre thrills.<br/><br/>Kristanna Loken's cyborg candy replaces Robert Patrick's liquid-metal Lucifer (T-1000) in T3. The transforming T-X combines svelte endoskeleton with cool couture. The director utilises the T-X as an object of fetish, and takes satirical swipes at consumer culture. This machine is as vain as the species it intends to eradicate. Loken acquits herself admirably, but never approaches the polite terror of Patrick's pseudo officer.<br/><br/>Whilst characterisation is subject to minimalist treatment, Claire Danes (Kate Brewster) and Nick Stahl's (John Connor) chemistry is palpable and poignant.<br/><br/>Composer Marco Beltrami (the Scream franchise), whilst referencing Brad Fiedel's motifs, paints a surprisingly rich and evocative score that owes much to Prokofiev and Russian romanticism.<br/><br/>This third act inevitably dives into self-parody a la Return of the Jedi. However, whereas that overblown instalment foreshadowed the decline of George Lucas' space opera, Mostow's mean machine - from the vehicular chase to proto Hunter Killers - is determined to entertain in the form of pumped-up popcorn theatre!<br/><br/>The hyper violence is tenuously justified by the genuinely affecting denouement, which references, both stylistically and thematically, classic sci-fi of the 20th century. With or without the iconic figure of Schwarzenegger, this instalment promises that there is more to come from the Terminator franchise."

Did Schwarzenegger secretly write it? It really is vacuous and contains pretentions expoused as if by a five year old. There does seem to be some dodgy editing which shouldn't be allowed in a big budget film like this.

And I wasn't the only one in the theatre.<br/><br/>Arnie has even fewer lines than in the two previous Terminators, which is usually a good thing, but here it doesn't really improve the whole thing. We're even forced to see his bulky 50+ aged body in the nude, but the special effects department did a good job making him look in shape. Kristanna Loken doesn't need the special effects job, but we're treated only a couple of seconds with her bare-naked appearance.<br/><br/>In fact T3 fits perfectly in the action-comedy genre, so with T4 probably on its way, starring Arnie as the Terminator going for president, they'll have to cast Jackie Chan as his running mate.

It's a great roller coaster ride, but perhaps just a shade less so than T2.<br/><br/>And here's something I thought I'd never be saying ... Arnie is so good. His deadpan delivery of some of his hilarious lines is  just spot on, and he even makes you feel the confusion of the man-machine faced with moral dilemmas.

","After years of waiting, it seemed that one of the most magnificent Science fiction movie franchises of all time was set to rest and lay as nothing but a dusty piece of old gold in the treasure chest. Now in 2003, director Jonathon Mostow attempts to pump up the volume as he tries to fit the classic shoes James Cameron was made to wear in the director's chair of the Terminator franchise. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a desperate attempt to revive the all time classic story of war against the machines, once again bringing back big `Arnie' in the role we all love to remember him by. As a huge fan of the previous films I had been waiting for T3 ever since the credits rolled at the end of Terminator 2. With the thick perfect story that ended the second film, how can the generation of film lovers get it all back in 2003. Without a single tone of regret I can say it was all made possible in this years hit movie. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a worthy sequel that treads carefully on science fiction grounds without trying to be too cocky. Now with use of more enhanced CGI effects, the story can be told with a deeper sense of visionary and style. With a neat plot that pushes the story of it's predecessor further without it seeming ridiculous, fans of the movies can walk out grinning with the fact that they finally know how the whole story ends. It's a charm to once again see `Arnie' in the boots that he was born to wear. He is without doubt the character he plays and never fails to deliver the comic relief and the sheer guts the role brings out in him.<br/><br/>The new `Terminatrix' was a daring original touch of careful script work that succeeded in giving something new to the whole Terminator story. The life of our human hero `John Connor' was a story just waiting to be told, and this film gives us that extra insight into the characters dilemmas and fate. `Nick Stahl' gives a worthy performance as the soon to be future fighter, although my mind couldn't help but wish `Edward Furlong' stepped back into the role that made the character so natural and innocent, as well as head strong and courageous. After all said and done, I can't debate which film of the now trilogy stands superior to the other two. `Rise of the Machines' tops it all off with a great climax with even decent potential for another film that could be fantastic. Although I am as satisfied as I am with the result, there still stands the most important question this film continuously resurrects. How would the film had turned out if it's original creator `James Cameron' had once again stepped in to direct and finish a complete trilogy? The answer we'll never know, but while you think about it, check out Jonathon Mostow's vision, it ain't at all bad."

The movie was on the verge of being terrible and a huge waste of time, but was redeemed slightly by the ending (and the car chase scene was pretty sweet).  Other than that, this movie was lacking in several of the areas where the first two movies succeeded... innovative special effects, tangible suspense,  well thought out, purposefully corny dialogue, Linda Hamilton...<br/><br/>Anyway, while I wouldn't recommend anyone going out and spending money on this movie, if you happen to have the chance to see it for free, or if it's on TV in the future, and there's nothing else on, it might be a quasi-worthwhile way to spend ~2 hours.  <br/><br/>If you haven't seen the first two movies, then T3 might even be considered pretty good.... but if you haven't seen the first two movies, your money and time would be better spent renting those, and not really bothering with this one..."

John is under the impression that judgement day was stopped but his dreams are still haunting him. Then the T-X shows up obviously wanting to kill 'old Jonny boy' and then Arnie turns up and the whole circus starts again. This time they are joined by Kate Brewster (Claire Danes, doing a good job of not stepping on the main characters' toes but still giving a good performance), the daughter of<br/><br/>I may p*** off several people saying this but its very good movie. Everyone seems to rate it next to T2- if its not as good as T2, then its not good. Well actually no. If you like action movies and arent too hung up on the T trilogy then you'll like this.<br/><br/>There is a lot wrong with this movie- the jokes border from amusing to, well, embarrassing; The T-X (Kristanna Loken) is nowhere as near as scary (or fun) as the T-1000, and as a result her 'hunt' for John Connor is nowhere near as tense-what made the T-1000 so great was the soulless and brutal way he killed people (John Connor's step-dad. Sword through the head. You guys know what I'm talking about), whereas T-X just seems to shoot people and even then camera cuts away (possibly done to keep the age rating down). When the two eventually meet at the climax, theres not the same tension and you just kind of want her to die and get it over with. Jonathan Mostow had an everest-style mountain to climb when he took this on and making and enjoyable movie was nothing short of a miracle, therefore I cant really criticise him to badly, apart from to say, sadly, hes just no Cameron, and that's ultimately what kills the movie in terms of `T3 vs. T2'. The terminator was Cameron's baby, after all.<br/><br/>O.k., now for the good stuff, of which there is a lot. The characters are likeable without being cheesy- Danes knows her place as Stahl's Love interest/sidekick, and Loken's performance is raised by the cool special effects. CGI is used a lot, but to aid the story instead of tell it, and that's The terminator's biggest weapon. As cool as the matrix films were, its always in the back of your head that it was all shot in front of some bluescreen, whereas T3 grabs you because it looks real. It really is a guy hanging on a crane, it really is Arnold throwing a guy through a wall.<br/><br/>The story is undeniably cool if a little bleak- and heres a second shocking point for all the fanboys-<br/><br/>(WARNING- SPOILER COMING..)<br/><br/>I don't think Cameron wouldve had the balls to have had the apocalypse ending- look at Aliens, look at Terminator 1&2, ok key people died, but Cameron could never handle a plot twist or a depressing ending, and that's where Mostow really shines.<br/><br/>
(SPOILER OVER)<br/><br/>Other good points the `arnold on a crane' action scene is as good as anything T1 and T2 offered up, and Mr. Schwarzennegger is easily the best thing about this film- ok his humours crap, and his `emotional' scene with Stahl is uncomfortable, but he is simply `the man'. You cant help but cheer when another car explodes, or when another Arnold one-liner comes out; and that's what makes T3 great- its not genius in terms of quality, its not the best in the series, but it gives you what you want- Arnie blowing s*** up, saving people and saying `I'll be back'. He may over the hill, but I certainly hope he keeps his promise."

","When I first heard that this film was going into production a few years ago I was excited at the prospect of another instalment of the Terminator. However when I read that the same basic plot was going to be used (i.e. bad terminator sent back in time to kill John Connor and Arnie sent back too in order to protect him.) and that James Cameron would not be directing the film I started to doubt whether this sequel could live up to the first two.<br/><br/>The film begins well enough with John Connor (Stahl) telling how he lives 'off the grid' and how he still feels insecure about his future even though he prevented Judgement Day. This is followed by a stunning CGI scene, depicting the future war between Man and Machine.<br/><br/>It is not long before the new T-X arrives. Kristanna Loken plays the part of the T-X extremely well. She combines sexiness with cold-hearted ruthlessness excellently. The problem is that I find it difficult to find a stunningly beautiful woman scary and this was what was missing throughout the entire film. The fear factor and sinister ambience in the first two films was lacking here.<br/><br/>Shortly after the arrival of the T-X comes the main man. Arnie arrives looking just as good as he did in the previous two films. He certainly hasn't lost his terminator 'charisma'. Arnie goes in search of clothes and the scene that follows gives the impression that the Terminator, a hardened killing machine has been turned into a bit a joke, especially after he walks out of a strip joint brandishing a pair of star-shaped glasses. Arnie delivers one-liners throughout the film giving it more of a comedic sense. In the first two films the comedy was used not only to relieve tension, but to also develop the character of the Terminator. Arnie's terminator has lost a bit of its 'cool'. In T1 he was evil, T2 he was cool, in T3 he is a joke.<br/><br/>The action sequences in the film are second to none. The action sequences definitely live up to its predecessors. They aren't ground breaking, but are certainly highly entertaining Arnie riding a police bike is reminiscent of him in T2. When watching some of the action sequences you get a sense of déjà vu as some are similar to that of T2. A bit more originality would not have gone a miss.<br/><br/>After T2 we got the impression that Judgement Day had been avoided. However. This appears not to be the case. The terminator gives a one-line reason why Judgement Day has not been prevented and for me this was not good enough as it left a gaping hole in the plot. If the reason why Judgement Day had not been prevented had been explained properly then in would have added to the plot more. This unfortunately underlines the focus of the film. The focus being on special effects and action rather than on the story and characters.<br/><br/>Stahl delivers a competent performance and works well with Danes, who also delivers a good performance. I would rather have seen Edward Furlong reprising his role as John Connor, but Nick Stahl is an adequate replacement. Danes runs around like a screaming teenager in a horror movie in the first half of the movie, but eventually matures into a fighter like Sarah Connor in T2.<br/><br/>The final fight between the T-X and the T-101 sees Arnie deliver his final one liner. This probably will not be remembered as readily as ' I'll Be Back' or 'Hasta La Vista.. Baby', but is nevertheless a good line for Arnie to finish on. The final scene sees Judgement Day descend upon the world and leaves the film wide open to a sequel.<br/><br/>My final verdict: A good film by itself, but it lets down the Terminator series. 7/10"

The machines do arrive in the form of the T-X model (Kristanna Loken) but with John being so hard to find, the T-X has secondary targets to search out. A mechanical protector, a T101 model (Arnold Schwarzenegger), arrives to help protect John and one of his future lieutenants (Claire Danes). Then the chase is fully on because the delayed ""judgement day"" is now eminent and Arnold's T101 is so vastly outmatched by the T-X. (And also because this is a sequel.)<br/><br/>The story is a bit thinner this time out, but few people could be expected to match ""Iron Jim"" Cameron's fiercely perfectionist filmmaking step for step. However, ""U571"" helmsman, Johnathan Mostow, is up to the task of keeping the action rolling and pulling the viewer along for the ride. He sets up everything as obstacles for the heroes, including things that are not usually found in action films, such as kennel cages, a particle accelerator and one wildly out-of-control construction crane. While the design of the T-X villain permits her almost every resource the situation demands, Claire Danes bears quite a bit of the missing exposition from John's childhood as well as the burden of frequently being a convenient plot device. However, she does it unflinchingly and helps carry the action forward.<br/><br/>Describing the action in any greater detail would be the same as telling everyone in line for the roller coaster the exact number and direction of the turns in the rail. The effects and stunts are all there in cutting- edge glory. This `Terminator' is not as dark as the first, nor as envelope-pushing as the second, but it is a complete thrill ride, and a welcome one in a summer of multiple action failures. It's worth the trip to the theater. Just try not to think too much about it afterwards.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

","Terminator 3......hmm.<br/><br/>I saw this film reluctantly; after learning that James Cameron was not going to be involved, I immediately wrote it off. Being a BIG fan of the first 2 (the first one more), I just knew that this third installment was not going to live up to the excellence of the first 2 films. Well, I was right. Quite frankly, this should not have never been made. Why can't people leave things alone? The Terminator franchise, The Terminator idea, is James Cameron's and he and he ALONE should do these films. It's HIS brainchild, and if he isn't involved, the very idea of doing a sequel without him should be scrapped. But in the end, its all about money, isn't it?<br/><br/>With all that said, this movie by itself isn't bad at all. Some pretty good action sequences keep you entertained. I was skeptical about there being a female Terminator, but she was good in her role. As a stand-alone action film, its not bad. But put alongside the first 2 Terminators, T-3 is....well......just 'there'. It's very bland and doesn't have a expand on the story enough to help keep the Terminator franchise in greatness. Essentially, it adds nothing to the saga shown brilliantly by the first 2. This just can't live up to the Terminator name, and has unfortunately tainted the name to some extent. Whose fault is that? Well, it could be the makers of T-3 for even trying to make a sequel, or it could be the first 2 Terminators for being that damn good. Either way, this should never have happened, and I pray to God there isn't a 'T-4'. ** out of **** stars."

","Terminator 3 is a classic case of one film too far, but not because it's an appauling film. In fact, so far it's one of my favorite films this year. It has (obviously) some fantastic action sequences, reasonable plot and some meorable scenes. The reason it's one film too far is because to try and compete with its originals and make just as fantastic film is a very, very tough job indeed. Terminators 1 and 2 were grounbreaking films which truly deserve to be in the top 100 films of all time. Sadly, T3 is not. It lacks the character relationship T2 had, the acting ability of Michael bienh (T1) or Hamilton (who is sadly missed in this film), and the new terminator is not played anywhere near as well as Robert Patrick's menacing T-1000 from judgement day. In short, Terminator 3 is an all-out action, thorogughly entertaining film but with poorer acting, and a lesser plot and script. By all means go and watch it, but don't expect anything particularly special. A great saga overall, but i feel that it's finally Hasta La vista, baby.<br/><br/>Jas"

","It's only natural for a franchise to progress in stile as it goes on. You had the original Terminator, which was a sort of sci-fi horror. Then there was Terminator 2, a thought-provoking actioner. And now we have Terminator 3, a teen-orientated, cartoon violence, no-brain popcorn muncher. It seems we have a Terminator for the Buffy the Vampire Slayer generation. Think 'Robocop: the Series' and you might get some idea.<br/><br/>Fans of the first two films, like myself, will be mortified. So stay well away. However, ignoring the film's heritage, it still isn't even that good on its own. As a special effects heavy action film, it scores a generous below average. As anything else, it's a non-event. It has bad acting, a bad script, bad direction, even bad editing. It is, to sum up, cack.<br/><br/>The only vaguely impressive performance is by Danes. Stahl is distinctly mediocre and Schwarzenegger doesn't appear to be even trying. And someone should have pointed out to Loken that the reason Schwarzenegger and Patrick were so intimidating in the previous films was because they deadpanned while they were busy killing people. She needed to show less emotion and definitely quit the pouting.<br/><br/>OK, it has its moments. The chase scene and the fight in the toilets are impressive, but will have you laughing out loud rather than on the edge of your seat. The action is more reminiscent of Tom and Jerry than anything else. As such, you can't take then ending seriously, not matter how hard it tries.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and they use the 'f' word twice in a 12a-rated film. Ooh, how rebellious."

Perhaps 'Skynet' would have based all of their 'machines' on its' matrix design.<br/><br/>

I was disappointed to hear that Cameron was too busy writing scenario for is Dark Angel crap and earning money from Titanic to do a Terminator 3. Maybe he also didn't want to do it but at least he could have participate or writing the script. (no film from him since 97 he never waited so long for making movie)<br/><br/>Because oh my god, the plot is gone. What made the first 2 Terminator such good movies was the plot and the depth of the characters. But this time it's only shallow shells and bad acting (except from both Loken and Schwarzenegger) And where there's a little of plot most of it is incorrect regarding the previous terminator. (and I'm not talking about James Cameron Coda in the never seen before version from Terminator 2)<br/><br/>The wrong guy died in T2 and despite all the research and material which both Skynet and the T models are based upon are destroyed, everything is still the same and all the Terminator and Machines just look like the same. the T-101 after making a shooting in a pack of Policemen is checking for human casualties which as no place in the film since it's not the same Terminator John told about how wrong it was to kill people. As for Sarah Connor dying of Leukemia it's not directly a plot hole. But how lame that was ?<br/><br/>Now to the good parts.<br/><br/>The T-X. Great idea a female Terminator is something they should have done earlier for a simple reason, women are less suspected than men. So the beautiful woman the T-X is would more easily be undercover than the T-101 big muscles with killer face.<br/><br/>The Action. Ever present and never boring. They've done a great job with the action scenes. Long but not too long Car chase with a good use of the environment, Short but effective gun fights and the cherry on top of the cake, great fight between both Terminators (too short to me but we cannot have everything we want in a movie).<br/><br/>Now about acting<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger: The same old good T-101 and it's best role so far. He was better in T2 but still know how to make a good old fashion cold hearted killing machine.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl: Laughable, He as nothing to do in this movie even though the plot and the acting parts are really not the thing to focus on. Stahl just did a poor version of the always on the run disturbed guy. If Judgment Day actually happens, with is lack of Charisma and being the leader of the revolution... we're screwed.<br/><br/>Claire Danes: (Spoiler) Good actress but average performance she does too much screaming and the line she had were not the brightest. She lose her Fiancé cry a couple of tears then talk about John and her making out with a big smile on her face.<br/><br/>
Kristanna Loken: Great in the movie. Too bad she has not that many lines. Because her acting as a killing machine is very credible. She brought the cold blooded ice woman to the top. Plus she has many face expression in the movie which makes her part very difficult and yet did those scene to a near perfection.<br/><br/>
Overall: As an action movie it's a great movie. I gave it 8. If you are a diehard fan from the first two opus you might be truly disappointed. But I took it like a related film not like a sequel which made me enjoy it to the fullest. Fan of action go see this film."

There are numerous plot holes, time line contradictions and scenes where the special effects were clearly obvious. First of all, the movies takes place as if T2 never happened. The whole premise behind T2 was the creation of the machines based on finding the chip and the arm from T1. After their destruction, the movie should have ended. Now, the movie is based off a secret government agency creating machines that are now being taken over by a ""virus"". The worst part is, after all the effects, all the action and even the humor which could have saved the movie...judgment day still happens?!?!?!?<br/><br/>Problem #1- in the movie, Sarah Connor dies in 1997. The problem with this is that T2 was based in 97 and she certainly didn't look like she was on her last leg. Problem #2- The TX was designed to terminate Connor's lieutenants, yet she magically runs into Connor in a situation too preposterous to believe. Lastly, when she does find him, she has numerous opportunities to kill him, but never does. Can't figure that one out. Problem #3- Clearly Connor survived judgment day, as did Brewster. So what was the point of getting them to the bomb shelter when they survived the attack in the first place? Why on Earth make judgment day still happen?

","It's been 19 years since The Terminator; 12 years since Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Arnold has gotten older, movie-technology has gotten more advanced, but how does this affect the third installment to the Terminator-epic...?<br/><br/> First of all, I'm not gonna be one of those critical souls shouting that this is a poor movie, cause one thing must be clear: Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines is FAR from being poor. The story is still exiting, the special effects are as good as you'd expect, the acting is quite OK. However, T3 leaves you a bit disappointed. There is something lacking despite all the fancy camera-work, the high speed chases, the rough action, basically all the blockbuster eyecandy can't remove the feeling that T3 should have been a little bit...better.<br/><br/> While watching T3's two predecessors, there has always been a certain unique atmosphere present; an intense excitement; a sence of impending doom when the Terminator is chasing after it's targeted victim. That very atmosphere was what made both films so very good, together with - of course - very well written scripts, great directing, and awesome soundtracks.<br/><br/>T3 has got action sequences which are at times better than the first two movies, with crispier CGI. But that feeling of doom, the terror of the terminator is gone. When Robert Patrick was on screen in T2, you felt an eerie presence of his bad guy-character, the same with Arnold in the first movie.<br/><br/> Kristanna Loken who plays the female T-X terminator in T3 is a pretty girl, no doubt about that, but she completely lacks the ability to send out any eerie-vibes what so ever. You just don't feel intimidated by her. Her general performance isn't really good either, and despite the fact that she hardly has any lines, it is all too easy to see that she is no Cate Blanchett when it comes to acting. The rest of the cast do an OK job though, while Claire Danes' ""damsel in distress""-character gets a little annoying at times. I love Arnie in this movie, and it's been a while since I did. His latest movies has been quite disappointing, but in T3 you'll find him back in good old-fashioned style. OK, he's not an Oscar-material actor (never was, never will be), but he IS the Terminator!  <br/><br/> One of the movies' downfall, is the script. Cause the script for T3 doesn't work as well as the scripts for two first movies did. And while Jonathan Mostow is a talented director (I think both Breakdown and U-571 were good films), he hasn't got the story-telling ability that James Cameron is the master of. Cameron, who directed both the two first Terminator-movies, knows the story better than anyone, and I think he would have been the perfect choice for T3 as well.   But all together, Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines is an enjoyable action-flick, with some very funny moments as well (Especially the ""Talk to the hand""-line from Arnold while walking out of a gas-station without paying for his merchandise). Just a little shame that the movie is not as good you would hope it to be. But maybe a 4th movie will do the series total justice. Atleast the ending sure opens up for a 4th Terminator-epic. <br/><br/>I have a feeling that sometime in a not too distant future, Arnie will be back...untill then, I will get out of here! <br/><br/> My score for Terminator 3 - Rise of The Machines: 7/10 (T2, the best in the series as I see it, would get 9/10)"

This is more comic than Daredevil, The Hulk and other X-Men's...

","Consider this proposition: a movie that's the second sequel in a franchise now totally dated, a movie that comes a full 12 years after its predecessor - a period in which the main star has aged significantly and lost the level of popularity he had in his salad days, a movie that went through endless hassles in writing and pre-production and was likely to generate interest only in the most rabid fans.how would you expect such a movie to turn out? Entertaining? Witty? (Dare we say) Intelligent? Take heart then, for Terminator 3 is all of these. Its also the perfect adieu to this now venerable series. Full credit for this goes to the team of writers (John D. Brancato, Michael Ferris III and Tedi Sarafian), for the first time the action sequences are not the meat of the film but supplement to a deviously clever script. There are tons of tongue-in-cheek references for Terminator fans to catch (Arnold's trademark entry is given a delicious twist), and a sense of satire is quite evident, but the spoofing never goes overboard and is done in a spirit of affection and respect for the series. There is also a good deal of ironic humor, even a Woody Allen-esque moment with the psychiatrist character from the earlier movies. The action sequences are done with the usual pyrotechnics but seem to have a deliberate Tom-and-Jerry flavor (most evident in the crane chase scene). The film neatly draws in the sparse threads of narrative that fueled its predecessors and steadily powers its way to the climax. And what a climax! Without spoiling it for people who haven't seen the film, I would consider it ironic in the most wonderful sense that a franchise whose worth has mostly been measured in terms of the mindless thrills it offered concludes itself in this surprisingly sophisticated way. I was really quite satisfied with this film, the only nit I have to pick is with the character of the villain, the T-X (Kristanna Loken) which was played out in a very colorless manner.<br/><br/>The Terminator leaves us on a high note.

Rise of the Machines should never have been made. ok fair enough, the studio has made a profit, so for them  and for arnie ($30 million dollars in his pocket and respect to him) and it was in fairness a fairly decent film. but in context with the earlier films The Terminator and Judgement Day, it doesnt even compare.<br/><br/>James Cameron wrote Judgement day clearly to have a closed ending, so no sequels could infact be made, and therefore as such we have an immediate hole in the T3 plot. this however i can just about abide.<br/><br/>But the constant self parody of arnie's T-800 character erased all the intensity and seriousness for which he was originally created. he no longer is the unstobbable murderous cyborg, but instead a comic figure which audiences laughed at consistently. the for a start it relinquishes any potential intesity the film may have had.<br/><br/>also the first two terminator films had schwarzeneggers character as still character which would kill at the slightest opportunity, again this was gone in favour of a more younger audience pleasing character. all well and good, but in context with the this world created by James cameron it does not fit.<br/><br/>i could go on forever about holes in the plot and nitpick consistently but i know a lot of ppl have yet to see this. and most probably you will enjoy it. but serious observers of the first two who were enthralled by their brilliance will be disappointed by such a lesser film"

","The rather unwanted sequel to the sequel of Terminator has limped to the big screen - and whilst its not as bad as it could have been, its certainly not great. Twelve years is a long time to wait for a sequel and T3 feels like T2 warmed over for a kiddie-friendly rating.<br/><br/>Ahnult now looks like he's been inflated with a bicycle pump and freshly dipped in wood-stain - he appears to have been freshly varnished and provides a slightly less realistic central performance than the Cuprinol Man. Once again we have to endure his trademarked sense of 'humour', which is about as funny as being forced to sit through 'Patch Adams' at gun-point. Unlike most people moving from a German-speaking country to America, Ahnult's command of English appears to be getting worse. Not for the first time, I wish the film makers would subtitle him - no, I actually wish they'd cast Ahnult in a silent movie, but I can't expect too much.<br/><br/>The actors playing John Connor and his wife-to-be are so instantly forgettable that their names won't be bothering major casting directors in the future, (but do expect them to turn up in your local video store 'starring in' movies involving post-apocalyptic kickboxing cyborgs travelling through time).<br/><br/>Not to mention which that our best hopes for mankind are so damned brattish that you can't help but root for the machines. On the upside, the new Terminator is very cute and her inflatable breasts are well and truly aimed directly at the teenage male demographic. I have to say that she is perhaps the most attractive way to die since Ellen Barkin did/didn't do it all those years ago in 'Sea of Love', but hasn't someone done the shape-changing unstoppable, liquid metal robot before?<br/><br/>The plot - well there might be one, but don't study it too hard - its like one of those 3D illusions that were all the fashion a decade ago - some people claim to see things of wonder, the rest of us just get a headache working out what all the fuss is about. The movie threatens to become interesting only in the last few minutes, but by then you're probably more worried about deep vein thrombosis setting in than the potential end of the World.<br/><br/>Oh and can I have a word about the first Terminator machines? Their brutish menace is ever so slightly undermined if you've ever seen 'Short Circuit' - 'Number 5 is ALIVE!'<br/><br/>In short - if its a choice between this and 'Hulk' - see 'Hulk'; if its a choice between this and sitting out in the evening sun - slap on some sunblock, after all you won't have long to wait before Blockbuster have plenty of copies of T3 on the shelves.<br/><br/>Best wishes,<br/><br/>Mike."

But after there short intro, you just get thrown into some action scenes with arnold vs Kristanna. And the story is left open for the second part of the movie. A very unfortunate factor according to me as I was sitting there waiting for the story while they were trashing vehicles and blowing up s***.<br/><br/>However terminator three makes a good story after and the plot is nice. But try to tell the story of the movie to a friend. For some movies you can talk an hour. You need minute maximum to explain everything with this one. That's why I didn't really like the movie.<br/><br/>Terminator is still one of the classics and excellent to see with a nice bag of popcorn.<br/><br/>One thing is for sure...

"Sneaky_Pete_Repeat","Null","0","0","11 August 2003"," Where's Chevy Chase?
","I'd have to agree entirely with sem-2's comments. The Terminator series ended with T2: Judgement Day.<br/><br/>This seemed to me to be more like a National Lampoon's version of the first two movies, both of which carried the distinctly darker atmosphere you would expect from a movie that concerns the end of mankind. Arnie spouting off ridiculous one-line gags (""talk to the hand"" - please?) and using those dated but ""oh so funny"" catchphrases throughout the film, gave it a cheesy feel and really takes the edge off. There were simply far too many laughs.<br/><br/>Visually, it is spectacular with plenty of explosions, death, destroyed buildings and car chases but the absence of James Cameron really tells - that integrity of keeping some sense of realism even in the most unrealistic of sci-fi scenarios, which he does so well, is completely absent in T3.<br/><br/>The loss of Sarah Connor from the plot was a blow. On-screen, she embodied the sense of fear and impending doom for the human race in both of the earlier movies and that was definitely lacking here. It is a shame also that Edward Furlong could not have reprised the John Connor role, if only for the sake of continuity and a sense of familiarity with the character. Taking nothing away from Nick Stahl, who I consider to be a fine young actor (he puts in a safe performance in `Rise of the Machines').<br/><br/>Major fans of the first two movies will be disappointed, as I was. However, the film had a lot to live up to, attempting to follow its predecessors and given that I was extremely sceptical before even getting to the movie theatre, maybe I'm being overly critical.<br/><br/>If you liked ""Starship Troopers"" and you're not a Terminator ""fanatic"" then you will quite probably love this film.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, the story of the Connor family and the end of the human race was told satisfactorily in 2 parts.<br/><br/>6/10"

","As a fan of both previous Terminator films, I wasn't expecting much from the third.  Need I say Alien 3?  I was hoping that they wouldn't detract from the true basis of Terminator and they haven't.<br/><br/>It keeps the plot and actually fits quite well.  There are no ""let's tack this on so that we have a plot for the third film"" extrapolations, we finally find out what type of machine SkyNet is.<br/><br/>It has a touch of humour but nothing that stops it from being a Terminator film.  Sometimes you are watching the screen for minutes at a time during the action scenes, not because it's a massive fight, just for the ideas that the characters use to get their own way.<br/><br/>The Arnie Terminator is a bit meaner than the one in Terminator 2, less human.  The new female Terminator isn't as rubbish as the trailers show. The computer graphics are used sparingly and only where they're needed.<br/><br/>John Connor isn't the world leader you expect him to be, but that's because he hasn't gotten there yet.  The character seems to follow from Terminator 2 quite well, though.<br/><br/>There are no glaring movie-isms... the new technology is pretty and not too elaborate.

"Rainfox","Null","0","0","10 August 2003"," A legit blast from the past - the battle has just begun
","* * * ½ (3½ out of 5)<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines<br/><br/>Directed by: Jonathan Mostow, 2003<br/><br/>Let's get right to it, shall we? Is Jonathan Mostow's Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (""T3"") bad? Is it what we feared, considering it's primarily a box office vehicle and career savior for a forgotten Arnold Schwarzenegger and completely without mastermind James Cameron's involvement? And does it seriously wrong the two previous? No. No. And no.<br/><br/>Not at all. In fact, it's very good. Worth the wait? Yes. Would we rather have had James Cameron's vision still? Of course we would. But T3 is a legit blast from the past evident from the somber and charming opening voice-over by Nick Stahl (as John Connor, bringing us up to speed) all the way to the clever plot twist at the end. T3 holds its very own. Or as Ah-nuld's returning Terminator dryly remarks: ""I am nod shidding you.""<br/><br/>What do we get then?<br/><br/>We get Ah-nuld - back and ready, now 55 - slipping seamlessly (physically too) into the one role we must remember to give him credit for. As the twisted steel endoskeleton killing machine, covered in human tissue, the heavy-accented non-actor is a welcome kick in the face.<br/><br/>
We also get a storyteller with a heart in director Mostow. Operating on a gigantic budget of $170m he wisely remembers that bigger and louder isn't necessarily better. There's a story to be told here. Maybe T3 predictably follows the traditions of the first two (time zone arrivals, introductions, a big chase and a final shootout and confrontation), but Mostow is surprisingly refined in his approach and passes the Cameron-test with ease. T3 has the same texture, the same grit and the same vacuumed atmosphere of despair, making it - okay, in its best moments - slither right in alongside its two predecessors.<br/><br/>Sarah Connor is dead and her son and future rebel leader, John, is now a twenty-something drifter, living ""off the grid"" with no address or phone. Stahl plays both to the juvenile (and, honestly, bad-acted) pop charm of Furlong from T2 and to his own (and Mostow's) idea of an older and emotionally wrecked loner. Amidst the mayhem and inferno, Stahl lends weight with a natural command of what's at stake here: the human race and the integrity of a renowned action franchise. Stahl is an absolute steal. Co-star Claire Danes even brings back fond memories (of Hamilton) from the first one.<br/><br/>The same can unfortunately not be said of Kristanna Loken as the new villain(ness), the liquid metal T-X. Don't blame Loken - she's fine when she's on screen even though she naturally lacks some of the spine-tingling intensity of Patrick in T2 (a case of having been there, done that). It's when she morphs into computer effects there's a weird occurrence. 13 years have passed since the last time, but the liquid metal of the T-X - you'd imagine that CG has improved since then - seems strangely more stingy and effects-pasted than the fluent ooze and flubber of the old T-1000 from 1991. Also, the T-X is maybe too much to swallow as a concept: In my review of T2 I questioned the ability of the T-1000 to form human skin and clothing fabric, but here it is completely out of bounds. The T-X can form interchangeable firing weapons (rockets too) with her hands. Well, can the liquid thing - the matter - then generate new matter so that it doesn't ""shoot off"" its own essence? If so, why not just change into an atomic bomb and go off?<br/><br/>The old Terminator flicks were likewise rich on goof-holes, but this does bog T3 down. There are also too many one-liners dating back to Ah-nuld's annoying celebrity traditions, a grand helicopter crash that doesn't spark any intensity and Earl Boen shows up (out of nowhere) as Dr. Silberman purely to generate recognition other than Arnie himself. This is where T3 sticks out like a sore thumb.<br/><br/>Luckily, there are more positives than negatives. Stan Winston's gorgeous and glittering silver cyborg designs are a welcome return in these sickening times of CG overload courtesy of over-reaching ambitions by formerly inventive filmmakers (take your pick: Spider-Man, Hulk, Matrix Reloaded, parts of the Lord of the Rings series and the Star Wars prequels). And when Arnie and the T-X slug it out in a kind of robotic martial arts slam dance (destroying an office restroom complete with urinals and toilets), it's an intoxicating blend of adrenaline, mechanical power and sexual energy. You feel the bruises and bending steel. Back to basics fist fighting, bare-bones dogme action at its finest. T3 actually seems like a throwback to the nitty-gritty cinema heyday of rugged stuntmen, breathing explosions and cool editing (a superb job by Neil Travis and Nicolas de Toth). Full of B-movie values and subtle plot-moving stopgaps but operated from a mega budget.<br/><br/>
Sure, T3 is clouded with zippy CG effects, but the best scenes and set-pieces are for real. You may speculate just where all the money went then. Relax. That's a real street, a real area of Los Angeles, that gets demolished in the gawking crane and fire truck chase that not only bolts out as a shocking display of property damage, but as the most intense and satisfying Armageddon on wheels since William Friedkin's freeway spectacle in To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). Leaving CG-drenched stinkers like 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) and Driven (2001) in a cloud of Judgement Day dust. The action in T3 is worth the ticket alone.<br/><br/>But Mostow's spice of choice is subtlety and the little things add up. Arnie picks up biker gear a third time around while you smile, the technical evovlement of Cyberdyne is displayed but not pondered upon, and I did enjoy the 'heat plus sand equals glass' detail. Nice touch and a perfect example of how well-rounded this sequel was approached by the filmmakers.<br/><br/>Mostow effectively marries old and new with a tight and thought-provoking sci-fi story. The ending is a triumph, as Mostow and writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris keep the best for last and almost caressingly open Pandora's Box. An ending for the ages, logically - not just in typical greedy Hollywood fashion - paving the way for another sequel with the actual war of man against machine.<br/><br/>T3 is a pleasant Tinseltown surprise and a biggie with purpose. Don't be put off by a non-Cameron Terminator and shy away, or as Ah-nuld simply states in a hilarious scene: ""Don't do dat."""

","If you're a geek like me, you know stuff about movies before they hit theatres. It's called ""the buzz"". The buzz was pretty bad on T3. Linda Hamilton and James Cameron didn't want anything to do with it, it was a useless sequel made only for the cash, the online script sucked arse, yadda yadda yadda.<br/><br/>Well, booyakasha, did Jonathan Mostow prove everyone wrong. He made a humorous, exciting and at times, even dramatic/epic film. Is T3 a GOOD movie then, I hear you say in amazement? Yes, it is. It is beyond ENTERTAINING. It is GOOD. Depending on how it holds up on multiple viewings, it might even become GREAT.<br/><br/>We're heading into Subjectivesville, USA here, but I had an extreme fondness of the two other Terminators (especially T2). I spent summers, every day playing Terminator with my two neighbors (I was 11 back then or something). We took turns on who could be the T-800, John Connor and the T-1000. The concept of the Terminator is (as is Star Wars) a part of my childhood. So there is something about T3 (as with the prequels) that connects deep inside of me. But now that I've seen T3, I can honestly say that, unlike the prequels, it is not a GUILTY pleasure.<br/><br/>Arnie is born to play the part of the T-800 (but one does wonder why Skynet keeps building Terminators with Austrian accents) and the stoicine flair he does it with will have you cheering throughout the film. John Connor does not force him to soften up in this one, so it's all 2 TUFF 2 DIE all the time.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl is good as the doubting leader-to-be of mankind (though I'd still have preferred Ed Norton). He's sympathetic and likeable throughout, but unfortunately you don't get to see the transformation from alcoholic bum to Great Leader.<br/><br/>Claire Danes easily out-acts them all as Kate, John's future wife and second in command. Her reaction to the deaths of loved ones are almost as if she really was breaking out in tears on that set. PAY THIS GIRL MORE!!!<br/><br/>Kristanna Loken, my biggest doubt on this film. She can't possibly out-evil Robert Patrick as the T-1000 or even Arnie himself as the bad guy in the first one. She's just so damn hot! Well, to be frank, she didn't. She's not bad or anything, she does exactly what she had to do, but the sense of menace the T-1000 had just isn't there.<br/><br/>The story is a real winner. A friend whom I saw the film with fell asleep before the last half hour or so (he was TIRED, not cause it was crap), and if someone would have asked him about the ending, I assure you he could not give a correct answer.<br/><br/>So, do I want a T4? Yes, all it needs is Mostow, Stahl and Danes. And I assure you: THEY'LL BE BACK."

","Usually I avoid any movie with a ""3"" after it's name. But as T-2 was really good and I've heard good things about this movie, I went to see it. After watching the movie, I had several questions in my mind:<br/><br/>1) Where did they find this female TX model? C'mon people, it seems she was going to act in Kindergarden Cop but she mixed the studios and came to this film. Unfortunately she's as scary as Powerpuff Girls can be, but lacks the fun of Powerpuff's.<br/><br/>2) If TX was so clever, how come couldn't she change Arnie's program succesfully? What? Humanity? Love? <br/><br/>3) How come can our heroes come to the heart of Skynet so easily with a lot of weapons in their hands? Where's the security anyway?<br/><br/>
4) There can be more questions but as a result this is a good movie (except that ridiculous TX model), a fine sequel to Terminator series.<br/><br/>
5) Now one burning question remains: Will Arnie be the first US President that showed his butt to everybody in the world?"

Ok, yes, the classic lines now feel more like a joke among T-lovers and induced the audience to laughter more than to a feeling of something cool, but the winning concept goes on winning! Classic Terminator action of good quality mixed with good humor and some new turns, like the female terminator T-X (Kristanna Loken) and the time set to the last day of humankind as we know it...or is it???

","T3 is one of my favourite sequels ever made.  It is completely unique in that it is part of a unique franchise, where I'm happy to say, that so much story was developed and shown in the first and second (moreso the second) films, that all further storytelling is left behind, we know what's gonna happen in this flick, and director Mostow delivers .... T-X and T-800 major kick ass take no prisoners action.  Eat Toilet, T-X!!!!!<br/><br/>The best thing about this flick is that Director Mostow never once tried to make a film with Cameron's unique vision, but rather, has used his own vision, which has also proved unique and worthy of the Terminator franchise. He's obviously a fan.<br/><br/>Whilst Sarah Conner didn't appear, she was easily replaced by Katherine Brewster (Claire) and would probably give her a run for her money.  And lets face it, if there is any Sarah Conner action, than you know there has to be even MORE story. Stahl was great in the role of Connor, even if it was only because if I heard Furlongs high pitched girly squeal again I would kill myself.<br/><br/>Part 4 will be even better if writer/director's remember that they are NOT James Cameron and do not try to emulate his skill, if they don't try that, they may make yet another brilliant Terminator sequel."
"DocFun","Null","0","0","8 August 2003"," A movie on the mission to top the probably best sci-fi action movie ever made . . . mission failed!
","May contain minor SPOILERs!<br/><br/>I am a big fan of the first two Terminator movies and when I first heard that there is going to be another Terminator movie I was sceptical if it's a good idea. It had nothing to do with the fact that James Cameron wasn't part of the project, it just seemed to me that a) the story had to be bend too much to give a reasonable explanation why there are still Terminators who travel through time and b) Terminator 2 has already reached a cult status, it is a masterpiece of sci-fi action cinema and so outstanding in many ways that I thought it cannot be topped and therefore another sequel will be a disappointment. Now Terminator 3 (T3) is in cinemas and I've already seen it twice and my first sceptical thoughts were completely right. I'm not going to rip T3 apart - actually there were some parts I really enjoyed - but I clearly have to say that it is the worst of the three and doesn't reach the quality I expect from a movie wearing this name. Following I will point out exactly what annoyed me most in the new installment of the series:<br/><br/><ul><li>The jokes: Doesn't anyone dare to make an action movie where the characters are serious? The worst mistake was turning Arnold into a joke machine. While it definitely is a trend in modern Hollywood cinema and I also expect some funny lines in movies like Bad Boys 2, Rush Hour and Lethal Weapon, I hate to see such lines and situations in a Terminator movie. It wasn't part of the first two movies (at least not to this extent) and it completely killed the mood of the movie. I often had the feeling of watching a cheap parody rather than the serious attempt to produce a new part of one of the most successful sci-fi stories in movie history.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The villain: A big part of the movies success in trying to be better than it's predecessors was bound to the question: ""How do I top the coolest villain ever created?"" And apparently the creators failed to answer this question. I actually liked the T-X and also the way Loken acted, it's just that the endoskeleton design seems inferior to the T-1000 and was defeated too easy. The T-X just seems like an intermediate model between the T-800 and the T-1000. Still having the disadvantages of the endoskeleton but already having the liquid metal skin. And in my opinion the movie answers the question of her inferiority itself with the weak final battle. Compared to the over half an hour long final chase and fighting in the end of Terminator 2, destroying the T-X seemed like a piece of cake! When sitting in the cinema for the first time watching Arnie just holding back the T-X in the final battle scene I actually said out loud:""That wouldn't have happened to the T-1000!"" - I guess this sentence pretty much sums up what my complaints about the T-X are.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the violence (or the lack of it): Just as it seems that nobody can make an action movie without jokes in it anymore, it seems nobody dares to show some explicit violence on the screen. I'm not at all a blood-thirsty guy who's only happy when seeing a massacre on screen, but I'm getting tired of the directors cutting everything out of the movie. I think the violence of the T-1000 shown in Terminator 2 served the purpose of drawing an image of a really mean and scary machine. One of the lamest scenes in T3 was when the T-X killed Kate Brewster boyfriend and the camera just turns away and you see some blood squirting onto the picture frame. Once again, this killed the atmosphere of the movie ans sets it apart form the first two parts. The reason for this kind of directing is obvious - money. If getting a lower rating, more and younger people are able to watch the movie which results in more money for the production companies (even though T3 was still rated R! Why?). Here also lies my major complaint about director Jonathan Mostow. Whereas Cameron makes movies the way he envisioned them and wants them to be, Mostow clearly made the movie the way the producers wanted it to be.</li></ul><br/><br/>
<ul><li>The music score: Last but not least the music was a complete mess. I knew it was going to suck from the moment I heard they won't use the Terminator theme of the first movies. It's like producing a Star Wars movie without the opening theme - there's just something missing. And even the version played at the credits was poorly produced and didn't have the hard sound of the version in T2. But also aside from the title theme, the music was only average.Compared to the monotonic bass whenever the T-1000 appeared and the great hectic score in the chasing scenes in T2, the music in T3 seemed like some unconnected pieces of sound shuffled together and was missing in some parts completely (first half of the chase scene).</li></ul><br/><br/>I think all the points mentioned above combined to a picture of the Terminators, that simply wasn't cold and relentless enough. The feeling of the unstoppable killing machine, only focused on the completion of it's mission without paying attention to anything else just didn't come through the way it did in the first two parts.<br/><br/>Also the story seems very far fetched at times and there is almost no character development shown. Somehow it doesn't manage to make you really care about the fate of the main characters. And mentioning the word ""fate"": That's where the writers made the illogical bend I mentioned in the first lines of this review. In the first two parts two times the words of John Connor are cited: ""The future is not yet set. There is no fate but what we make ourselves!"" Even in T3 the sentence is engraved into Sarah Connors tomb. But in T3 John cannot prevent the Judgement Day because it is his fate and he cannot change it! Ups, something somewhere went terribly wrong!!!<br/><br/>
Finally some positive comments:<br/><br/>I really have no complaints about the acting. Especially I liked Loken as the T-X. She did a good job in showing an emotionless face throughout the movie and also walked and moved appropriate. Also Claire Danes did a good job, I liked her part more than I thought I would. There was nothing remarkable about Nick Stahls performance, but he didn't seem miscast as well. Arnie just seemed a little bit worse than in the first two movies, but I guess that's mainly because of the script. The visual effects also were great, but regarding that the first two movies set new standards at their time, there was nothing special about the effects in this movie. But I think that's a problem of the genre in general nowadays. It has become extremely difficult to create this jaw-dropping moments. Because it's become relatively easy to produce special effects many movies make use of them and so the audience gets used to it more and more. You simply need the money and hire the right people (e.g. ILM) and you can put them into your movie. So while T2 was ahead of it's time and it took at least 2 years to find something of comparable quality in another movie. T3 doesn't have this kind of quality or never seen before moments.<br/><br/>
Conclusion: This review is heavily based on a comparison of Terminator 3 to its predecessors. Taken on its own I would say it's a well made, above average action movie. However, considering the first two parts it has to be judged by other, more demanding measurements. And that's where it fails. It is simply not able to reach the quality and atmosphere of the first two movies and thus didn't live up to the expectations.<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10"

","Terminator 3 is technically well done like most of Hollywood films, and is also entertaining for a young audience. But the film lacks the good story the two  previous parts had. Nothing new you haven´t seen before. The major problem in my opinion is the absence of personal charisma and chemistry of Nick Stahl and Claire Danes in their roles. Both performers had shown before their talents in other films but here they are totally wasted, showing a poor character design for their parts. That´s why I consider Terminator 3 a mediocre movie."

","It´s not better then T2, and I think its not (much) worse. As others said, the acting, effects, action was ok, but Mostow wasnt the right man for this movie. The T-X was as good as the T-1000 (acting), and Kristianna Loken is not the one to blame if you didnt like T3.Here are just some things:<br/><br/>1. When Mostow saw Arnold in the leather jacket he said: Now we´re making a Terminator! Well, I´m very sorry to tell you that, but you were making a Terminator also before that. The movie needs too much time to start! Untill the machine is looking into the screen (this was very chilling to me) it´s OK, but then there are a few minutes really, ugly sh... and nothing hapens. Instead of showing Kate and John so much, that should be shorter and he should show us how Arnie got the gun... Then suddenly the Action starts, too suddenly! I think the composition of the movie is very bad, this is indicated even by the fact the movie is just 1:40 long (and for this Arnie had to pay extra!!).<br/><br/>2. Humor is OK, but it was too much! It was funny and I liked it (more funny then Bruce Almighty and Anger Management), but somewhere the director must say: It´s enough!<br/><br/>3. My most important point (and why I think the movie is not as good as the first 2 Terminators): In T1 and T2 John Connor is not born or hes not very important to the movie. Through the movie we see a cold fight, with less emotion... T3 has too much of John and Kate and their emotions... Even the Terminator is funny...! John Connor is ""The One"", the leader of the people, but this is during the war, this here is before it, John Connor isnt so much important here!<br/><br/>It seems that Director and Producer must have a T4 in their minds. If it will be without Arnie it is already sh... and not worth of making it! When Arnie will be back (I doubt in this!), then you need a story directly after the war started, in which John Connor wont show us his emotions, but show us why he is so important; it cant be just that he says he´ll take the lead."
"robford50","5","0","0","7 August 2003"," Disappointing, Mr Mostow.
","Let's cut to the chase, Terminator 3 is massively inferior to the two previous films.  And with a such a solid setup in place, Jonathan Mostow really must hold his hands up.  The problem here is the script, script, script.  I sat disbelieving as gag after gag rolled.  All very well, but this is a Terminator film, and regardless of the director's vision you have to respect what the previous films have set out, and by making the third film a comedy action flick, you're going to annoy a lot of fans 10 minutes in.  The third film has SO much scope - computers taking over the world killing billions of people in the process - yet after 109 minutes, you feel like not much has happened at all.  And that is unforgivable.  Arnie's Terminator is much less likeable, and has little chemistry with John Connor (the script doesn't allow much interaction).  It is a real pity Edward Furlong couldn't do this film, because he really had that strong personality coupled with vulnerability that made the Connor character his own.  Nick Stahl, as good an actor as he is, is just too wimpy and unassuming. The TX is a nice touch, but Robert Patrick's Terminator felt much more deadly.  But I guess that's the problem here: it just doesn't feel thought<br/><br/>out at all - we need a decent plot to get back into feeling for Arnie and John Connor.  We need more than action sequences to fully feel what Judgement Day will look like.  Especially T2 did this - Cameron's film was brilliantly structured, and so simply scary.  You could feel the clock ticking towards armageddon.  So much happened in that film, by the end of it you felt like you were losing a friend when Arnie died, in this film you really feel little attachment to any of the characters.<br/><br/>Overall, a disappointment.  This could, and should, have been a great finale, yet little in the way of intelligent plotting or characterisation leaves you with a cold feeling by the end.  I wanted to like this film, but Jonathan Mostow is getting into a habit of shooting slick films with potholed scripts.  Frustrating!"

","After a lot of quite positive critics about Terminator 3 and many positive reviews I thought that maybe T-3 would not be so bad as I had imagined. When it finally was released in Germany I was eager to see it on the opening day. I shouldn't have... T-3 is an average action movie but nothing extraordinary. Judged by its predecessors T-3 is inferior in every respect. T-3 neither has the dark atmosphere of the first Terminator nor the epic size of T-2. Okay, maybe one could not expect that, but at least I expected a serious treatment of the heir. However, the first 15 minutes seem to be a parody on T-2 (as if Jerry/David Zucker& Jim Abrahams had directed the bar-scence) and this really annoyed me. Also, the often praised car chase is not as impressive as the one in Reloaded. But that is not the point. The real problem is, that the Terminator is mocked and ridiculed in my opinion and the T-X seems by far not as dangerous as the T-1000 or Schwarzenegger in T-1. Where Cameron created a dark and dense atmosphere, strong characters + state-of-the-art action sequences T-3 hurries from one scene to the next without spending time on the characters or the story. Well, if you liked T-3 it is okay, but I do not think that anyone who loves the first two installments will be really satisfied with Mostows creation."

","Terminator 3 has been one of the most anticipated films to have been made in the last decade. The world sat on the edge of it's seat as the time drew nearer to the release date. ""Arnie is Back!"" ""This film kicks ass"", i tell ya man i heard it all.<br/><br/>That was until I heard that the reason Cameron did not make this film, is because he read the script and felt it was sub-standard. uh oh!<br/><br/>
Then I saw the film. And i really have to say, a VERY big dissapointment.<br/><br/>The film was two hours long, it felt like it was only half an hour. The action, well although special effects play such a huge part, it seems T2's more basic moves were better! And where was the classic music in the opening sequence??<br/><br/>The actors, Arnie. Always a pleasure to c him, but not quite the performance he gave previously in T2. John Stahl.....what??? rubbish! surely they could have found someone better! I know edward furlong is in rehab, but i'd rather wait however long it takes for him to come clean and have him in this role, other than anyone else! Everyone else is ok though, T-X did cool.<br/><br/>The director, Jonathan Mostow. How many films has he made as big screens?? Not many i'd say. He lacks alot in this film, something like Matrix Reloaded, too much action, less story.<br/><br/>The characters. John Connor, well written character, drug abuse, life on the edge, somewhat lost in himself, brilliant writing there. But he did not seem anxious enough to see the t-800 once more. You'd expect more from him. His wife, what is it with hollywood and it's new heroine style? it's lost it's touch! Sarah Connor, deceased. WWWHHHYYY??? she was the heart and soul of this film series, she's a primary character, why did they kill her off?? Disgusting. And then, Arnie. He looked too human to be the terminator, the previous ones took time to learn the ways of the world, he grasped it within five minutes, uh uh, no no no no no, a big slacking. And did anyone notice he was sometimes out of breath ""i..am... a.. machine!"" okay he's a robot, but the previous ones spoke like computers not humans, not until the end anyway. Mess up!<br/><br/>The story, Very sub-standard. The story moves too quickly. You don't have time to grasp it the way the previous films do. When the t-800 talks of Connors future death due to his boyhood experience with the previous terminator's, and how they only post-poned the war, this is a key factor in the story, it needed to be exaggerated more, it wasn't, 30 seconds tops, and your expected to be intrigued. Oh please! Where's the suspense?? The death of sarah connor, told in ten seconds, no intrigueing of the story, no emotion to the audience to say that John has been left to teach himself, it needed more exaggeration, stretch it out a bit more.<br/><br/>Overall, the film looked like a spoof, some of it was more funny than scary, the story was not good enough, the action was too fast moving leaving no time to make a lasting impression And why bring in the US government, we've seen enough of them in these type of films!!! They've exhausted themselves.<br/><br/>I hope to god the actors, story, and mise-en-scene come together if T4 is ever to be made! James Cameron is needed badly, and if anything, one final blast to finish the story of the Terminator, a film to eradicate the existance of T3. Arnie is ageing now, and politics is heading his way. So ppl had better move fast!<br/><br/>Overall mark, to be fair, 7/10, but could have been better by miles!"

Why was I empressed:<br/><br/>T3 - James Cameron, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong = Potential Disaster<br/><br/>With the odds going against him Jonathan Mostow pulled it off, he made T3 without any of the above elements and the end product was really good. Nick Stahl does a great job of taking Edward Furlong's place as John Conner, putting lots of emotion and grit into the part. Claire Danes does a magnificent job as Kate Brewster, also adding some raw emotion to her part. At age 56 Arnold looks as tough as ever as the Terminator proofing age is nothing but a number. Kristanna Loken does well as the T-X, a robot b!tch who just doesnt seem to go away. The storyline was well written and the action sequences were awesome. If you have not seen T3, go see it!

The effects are tremendous, and Arnold is on top form returning to his best-loved character. Some of his one-liners fail to hit the spot, but on the most part they succeed in entertaining, and the way he finds his trademark leather jacket is an unexpected treat.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are fine in their roles, though I was somewhat underwhelmed overall. Considering the powerhouse performances of the likes of Linda Hamilton in the first two movies, that isn't too surprising.<br/><br/>Popcorn fare of a very high quality, Terminator 3 is a weak film when judged as part of the Terminator canon, but in it's own way a real cinematic treat for a Friday evening."

","I think a friend of mine who saw it with me put it best: ""They knew it was going to be stupid, so why bother with plot?""  There's some sort of contrivance about why we're watching Arnie MK III fight a supermodel with CGI powers, but it's even thinner than what we got in the last movie and not particularly worth worrying about (although if you're hellbent on taking this movie seriously, you might ask why the people of the future picked almost the least-effective time possible to which to send their cyborgs). But really, if this movie's about anything, it's about watching cars blow up.  The humor's awful and the characters are boring, although if lip-quivering were an Olympic event Claire Danes would get the gold.  The movie promises very little, and admittedly, delivers it reasonably well. I have to admit I didn't get too bored, but I doubt the movie would play so well on a TV set at home."

","Any sequel needs a new, fresh, approach to either the story or its characters. Preferably both, of course... T3 lacks this, and is actually nothing more than a transportation to T4. Frankly, I was rather bored. Giving the TX a female gender is not a twist, actually it is hardly even variation, it is just boring. If anything, it is evidence that this Venus/Mars myth, which prevails in our society, is pure nonsense. (In case You had not found that out yet...) T4 has got the prerequisites of becoming another great movie, while T3 is but a story that has to be told in order to get a good basis for T4. This is unfortunate, but perhaps inevitable? Another thing that bothers me is Arnie's apparent personal influence on his own character, i.e. in the script. His ambiguity at the end of the movie messes up the ice cold logic of the plot, inherited from T1 and T2, which is a shame. Once re-programmed, he should act in accordance to that, without remorse. Personally, I would wish that Arnie's character was reduced to a minimum in the sequel(s) to come. The (great) overall story would gain tremendously from that."

","This is a summer action film, and if you approach it this way you will enjoy it. I liked it more than the other blockbusters of this summer. For a change there is a coherent story here, with the logic of a Terminator story, but still logic. The film is not too long, it does not have any philosophical pretentions, and you get what you paid for. Action is very well done, effects are first class, though there is no great innovation as in the previous films of the series who were classics of special effects. Acting is decent - playing robots makes the profession easier for Schwarzenegger and his female partner who do not belong to the Nicholson league. The only mis-cast is Claire Daines whose make-up and wardrobe make her look ten years older than her Connors boyfriend and future husband. Action movies fans should wish Schwarzenegger to lose the California race, so that he can make Terminator 4. Otherwise, 'Hasta La Vista...'. 8/10 on my personal scale."

","On the one hand we see the unbelievably harsh and brutal unfolding of events, that remind me of the classical greek tragedies - this is what evokes the emotional attachment to whats going on. Lots of scenes contain a violent conflict that is fought with utmost determination on both sides, and reduce their options and planing horizon to the next few seconds, their immediate vicinity and the people and objects that happen to bet there: the toilet battle, where the ingredients are a few square meters, concrete and ceramics; the crane chase where every appearing object (buildings, cars, front lawns, truck underbellies, manholes) is reduced to its usefulness for any side in the next few seconds; ultimately even the T101 itself, when its fuel cell turns out to be it's most useful property for the next two seconds. And on the other hand ravaging humor delivered not only by Arnold, but every cast member. (""you remind me of my mother""). Haven't seen anything like it, in that respect it was better than T2 (which of course was more original overall since in 1992 the overall plot was new), and every other movie i've ever seen. This is the really outstanding aspect of T3, to have an extremely grave, violent, serious tragic plot that is slammed into the viewers face in just about all scenes, and yet have hilarious humor without taking the bite of the seriousness of it all. Best movie of the year as far as i can see.<br/><br/>PS: Yes, T2 had more ""new"" plot, but imagine there was no T2, then T3's plot would be applauded as much as T2's was."

","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Oops!<br/><br/>Knowing the pants reviews this film had been getting and the fact it's a 12A did not bode well, but I had Sunday off and thought what the hell.<br/><br/>As a stand alone movie this probably would have been more entertaining. As a sequel to two of the definitive movies of the last 20 years it's a bit of a stinker that manages to waft away the stench a few times but still has the smelly cloud hanging over it by the end.<br/><br/>The most irritating thing is when good ideas are taken apart for sequels in the hands of by-the-numbers producers/ script writers et al who take the icing from a glorious cake but fail to realise that you need some marzipan and bit of fruit there too.<br/><br/>Prime example is the original Police Academy which was ruined by 7 poxy sequels that patronised the audience and took small pieces known to make us chuckle and did them to death. Great TV series have followed this sorry road with Men Behaving Badly, Drop the Dead Donkey, Miami Vice and even the excellent ""V"" hurtling down this road with the latter indulging in later episodes having lots of face peeling and lower jaw-detaching, hamster gobbling close ups to distract from the lack of good story.<br/><br/>And here...<br/><br/>While starting off excellently with the absolutely gorgeous TX appearing naked in Beverly Hills it sets the scene well, particuarly with John Connor's maudlin narration about how he has to live as a ""ghost"" for fear of being found by Skynet. However expectations wilt the moment that Arnie chances upon a Ladies' Night Bar to retrieve his clothes. The biker's bar in T2 was pushing it but the violence and ruthlessness of the scene plus the fact that it was NOT played for laughs meant that this could be overlooked. The scene where we knew the water skis were sailing over Bruce was when the Elton John shades came out. Bad enough that they contrived to give him his leather jacket in such a messy and shamelessly self-mocking fashion but to then say ""Hey lads, we KNOW!"" with a totally uneccessary and pointless additional piss-take ruined the last vestiges of credibility this had.<br/><br/>You don't laugh AT the Terminator. You don't make fun of him. He's not something to snicker at behind your medium-sized diet Cokes. A similar scene was done with more charm and in the space of 5 seconds in the opening credits of the A-Team. And while we're on the subject...the violence in this for the most part comes across as very A-Team-ish with cars crunched, entire building's destroyed and people thrown into heavy objects without suffering more than a sore head. Arnie's leather seems so stand up remarkably well too, sporting only a couple of nicks and tears after facing more punishment than Tyson's bonse after the Lewis fight.<br/><br/>Despite this, some scenes are VERY violent for a 12A. One can only assume that the BBFC's Quentin Thomas is the polar opposite of the rancid James Ferman.<br/><br/>The story fails to make sense a few times. If Arnie kills the future John Connor in 2032 AFTER the victory against the machines then how does that fit in? Similarly it is all a little too convenient that John Connor already knows Kate Brewster considering he's permanently on the move and why did John Connor choose as his future lieutenants a bunch of spotty herberts from high school.<br/><br/>The much lauded Good Terminator/ Bad Terminator aspect is awful and lasts all of 3 minutes. Rather than having him become the killer from part one for a while he simply has a tantrum and beats up a perfectly good car.<br/><br/>This whole thing smacks of lack of thinking and the desire to prop up the career of the future candidate for Governor of California. While Kristianna Loken is equally as good in her role as Robert Patrick was and, despite being 9 years away from his free bus pass, Arnie still rocks there is a lack of any consistent flame here even if the spark is good and strong a few times (firing a machine gun while carrying a coffin on one shoulder just looks so cool).<br/><br/>The one stand out moment is the downbeat and depressing ending. The otherwise excellent 28 Days Later was ruined by a falsely upbeat conclusion and I admire the film makers for going the whole hog with this.<br/><br/>Not good. The closest comparison I can make is that this is to T1 and 2 what Robocop 3 was to its forefathers."

"Silverzero","Null","0","0","8 August 2003"," Vapid, inept B-movie follows up to two A grade classics.
","`The Terminator' (1984) and `T2: Judgement Day' (1991) and rightfully considered as classics. Absolute landmarks in cinematic history. And while there have been campaigns against making another Terminator movie, for the sake of preserving the franchise, they went ahead and made a third instalment anyway. Not only that, it turned out to be the most expensive movie of all time. And for a film that cost some 200 million dollars, this doesn't live up to the hype. Essentially, `T3' is a B movie  unadulterated popcorn entertainment. Had it not been a sequel to the franchise, I might have a higher opinion of it. But it is an offence against sense to follow up to histrionic classics with `a B movie'. <br/><br/>I think that director Jonathan Mostow was just cowering in the background working with the excuse that it was a B movie, hoping that no one would make comparisons. Well guess what Mostow? They did. No James Cameron, no Linda Hamilton, no Edward Furlong, Michael Biehn, Robert Patrick. The only shred of hope keeping this alive is Arnold Schwarzanegger. And in fairness to Arnie, he does a good job of his character. But it seems as though he is written for laughs given a bunch of jokes to utter- some good, others desperate-and loses the menace and brilliance of his character in the predecessors. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nick Stahl gives the worst performance in the entire movie and is a very poor trade in for Edward Furlong. His lines aren't delivered with any believability, emotional scenes are incredibly flat and he simply ISN'T John Connor. Claire Danes on the other hand is a good trade in for Linda Hamilton (I can understand why she didn't want to be involved) and her relevance to the plot is believable. Kristanna Loken is absolutely terrible as the menace of the picture. Completely un-intimidating, instead of `Oh no! Look out' this is more a case of `Show us your boobs!' Also in there, Earl Boen jumps in just to say, `I'm here to explain why I'm still a cynic'.<br/><br/>
The script is shallow and dull, conceived in the most immature style. Sarah Connor is written off in the most ridiculous fashion. `I know, let's give her a disease. Cancer? No, leukaemia!' Luckily, the film clocks in at about 102 minutes, so it's fast-paced enough not to bore. Special effects sequences are okay, but a huge waste of money when the finished product is this mediocre. <br/><br/>An insufficient effort that, quite frankly, should never have been made, this is a very poor follow-up. Below average in acting, directing etc. this falls wide of the mark. On its own level, the movie is okay. But comparisons are inevitable and the expensive but brainless `T3' pales. Bottom line: die hard action fans, and those who see `The Terminator' franchise as infallible, only. My IMDb rating: 4.6/10."

(aliens, titanic, terminator 2) and i would think that he kinda thinks of terminator as one of the works of his lifetime, but why does he do such a thing with the terminator movies then? it's just sad... i liked the movie, but i think he just doesn't really like his terminator very much..."

","Controversial I know, but over the past four days I''ve seen this film 3 times and its grown each time. I'm not a massive fan of the Terminator francise, but i've loved Schwartzenegger ever since I can remember, his recent downfall in ratings and reviews needed to stop and T3 was the perfect way to do this. He provides a performance which is the greatist by any leading man in an action film since? what True lies? I don't know, he conveys power, but also willing to laugh at himself. Does Vin Deisel do this? Does Will Smith command the screen every time he's on it? Arnie has proved with this movie he is a star at another level to the before mentioned actors. His fee he picked up was deserved as it would not have been a movie without him.<br/><br/>Arnies not the only good thing about this film don't make any mistake about that. John Mostow creates a vision which no other director has dared do over the past few years, take a high budget film and dare cut it down to under 2hrs, sometimes a long picture deserves its length, The two lord of the rings films could not have been cut down, the size of narrative Peter Jackson is conveying deserves more screen time not less. Lets take other narratives though, the Matrix? it should have been shorter or not made, Hulk undoing was making a 2 1/2 hr film out of such a simple idea, people get bored, and in the end remember trudgeing through endless minutes of dialouge which is pretentious and meaningless rather than the sequences which did inspire awe. I was guilty of this with Hulk myself. John Mostow has broken the mould, he's taken a simple chase story and made it the length it should be, and i'm sorry but the ten minute fight scene between the T101 and the TX p****s on the proverbial parade of any of the 20 minute monster fights in matrix reloaded! You just get bored.<br/><br/>Character development is riskey and underrated in this movie thats Mostow and all the other actors taking the limelight.<br/><br/>Okay it cost 140m to make, thats a lot of money, and it's fair to demand an exceptional movie. Thats most peoples problem with this film, But this film is a lesson in making films to all the would be action directors and actors, make sure its not to long, unless it needs be, use real explosions and cars whereever you can, and get a star to perform in the movie, a name, who wasn't a little excited when the austrian oaks name fills the screen before the title of the film comes up?<br/><br/>For these simple lessons i give this movie 9/10  I give the same to T2 and I give 8/10 to The Terminator. T3 can kick the industry up the arse and show producers that just because it's costing loads it doesn't need hours of screen time and CGI being used to it's death. In an ideal world Arnold and Mostow will have recovered the action genre so the next Bond film is worth watching and the Matrix Revolutions doesn't get the hype of Reloaded. (and Vin Deisel will never work again!)<br/><br/>A cult classic.<br/><br/>How often do you say that about a $140m film?"

","Really enjoyed the movie. The look and feel of it are very much in the same vain as T2, the action almost relentless and some well placed humorous touches add to the enjoyment. One of the acid tests for a good action movie is a car chase. In this case the car/motorbike/crane chase was superbly well crafted and compares favourably with the freeway scenes in Matrix Reloaded and that movie's more sophisticated use of filming techniques. Definitely recommended, you could probably enjoy this without having seen the previous instalments. A note on the ending - I don't want to spoil it but the manner in which John Connor's destiny finally unfolds to become leader of the resistance is very clever. It was nice to see Number 5 from the Short Circuit movies as first generation Terminators in the Air Force development facility - shame it seems he has been type cast though. Finally, I have to say, despite her Swiss army knife functionality, the TX is nowhere near a match for the T-1000 from Judgement Day."

","It's been a long time. 6 years between the first and second, and now 13 years after the second, the 3rd.<br/><br/>In the hype up to production and release, the fervour around this movie centred on the absence of many key players in the previous 2 installments - such as Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, Robert Patrick, and, of course, James Cameron. So we have merely Mario Kassar (Producer), Stan Winston effects studios, and of course, Arnie. But to say the new director makes this an inferior movie would be innaccurate. Although there *is* a new feel to this, it's not a bad one. It's just different. Whether you can accept that will decide whether you enjoy this. The story obviously continues on from T2 but I won't give away exactly how it achieves this, because that's half the mystery. Arnie *is* the Terminator - his presence on screen is magic - he has the same 'charisma' as he had previously and still convinces. He's not quite as sympathetic as he was before, because he's playing a different kind of role this time. Kristanna Loken, as the Terminatrix, manages to ooze sexy danger pretty well. Sure, she's no Robert Patrick, and has little dialogue, but she does portray the cold efficient invincible nature of the Terminatrix pretty well. As John Conner, Stahl does a decent, if perhaps slightly uninspired job. He's probably the weakest player. Clare Danes is staple, again nothing particularly special. One aspect of T2 which is enhanced here is the comedy - there are many snappy one liners and humourous moments which serve well to counter the serious theme. The special effects are pretty seamless, and epic as we would expect. But the explosions are a tad overdone. I've never heard a noisier movie in my life. Some of them seemed just a bit unnecessary. As for the story, well it kept me gripped. I missed certain characters and the previous atmosphere, but this still did enough to have been pretty much worth the wait. If you like Terminator you *will* get a kick out of this.<br/><br/>(Look out for a cracking cameo from a previous character)"
"wimjim","6","0","0","7 August 2003"," Parodies with Alien Series.
","The Terminator series somehow parodies the Alien series. The first two films were amazing pieces of story telling, at different levels. The first one being dark, and edgy. The second to be more mainstream and action orientated. This accounts to both series and the fact that James Cameron is linked as director between these series, is strange also.<br/><br/>The difference now is that Alien has made up to 4 sequels, and more coming (so I've heard). Terminator stopped at number 2, till now. Both series had two great starters, and Terminator supposedly stopped at 2, it still had potential to carry on. Hollywood being Hollywood, they decided to do another one. As James Cameron directed both, it would be logical to let him carry the helm for the third time, but he declined. <br/><br/>If he declined so would many actors to follow, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, (Though I think they didn't pick him, due to drug offences). Though Arnold Swarzeneggar had to accept for the movie to go ahead, as he was the major star in the last two. Much like Sigourney Weaver in the Alien Series. He had to accept as he hasn't had a hit for a long, long time.<br/><br/>Like the alien movies, the standards set were very high, so the next sequel will be hard to impress. For me the third Alien movie, was different and wasn't bad, but compared to the last two it was poor. This is what I feel about Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines as well.<br/><br/>The problem with sequels, is that the audience knows the characters now, therefore people make their own judgement on how that character would react. Which may differ to the director. <br/><br/>The story: There is now a new model terminator, a T-X (Kristanna Loken)a more advance terminator than T-1000. Who has been sent back in time out to kill John Connor (Nick Stahl), who is now a lot older from the last outing. T-800 (Arny of course) is also sent back to protect him. Basically the same plot from T2, but there is a difference, T-X is a female and a lot more advanced. <br/><br/>My opinion of Skynet is that it would be illogical for them to make a terminator that is female, pretty and I thought they would explain the reason, but do not. For me Kristanna Loken plays a good killer, but it just seemed that Hollywood realised that the market in movies, are stronger women. Which has already been experienced in T2. It just doesn't work for me, though I'm not trying to be sexist.<br/><br/>I feel John Connor seemed a little weak for someone, who will lead the last human rebellion to victory. Even Claire Danes character was stronger than him.<br/><br/>The overall story destroys the message that was given in T2. Well it is still entertaining, certainly a lot more funnier than the last one. Can't believe it recieved a 12A rating in the UK, so I must insist you don't bring in children to watch this, as there is a certain scene that is quite disturbing.<br/><br/>C-"

","Beyond and over the protection of John Connor plus Kate Brewster (his future fiancé and co-commander against cyborgs), the film makes clear how and why those machines become self-function to destroy all human rather than repeatedly leave it as the matter of the future and insisting on mad individual fighting as in the first two only. <br/><br/>It is an intelligent script despite the last one already showing that the microchip has been destroyed. The film suggests the fact that disaster, tragedy, impact is never avoidable as long as we - human - keep raising our power competition through the destructive technology. <br/><br/>Regarding the film content, what I'd like to summarize is it could be the boring repetition, if there is nothing new within it in which the traditional storyline is always used for the dynamic images and narrative for its fans. This is - probably - why the script was created with the emphasis on the new issues in addition to keeping its typical form and content of Terminator which is widely perceived.<br/><br/>Further to this, whoever loves the first two made by Cameron may get disappointed with this one while I whose abhorrence towards those feel it is what I have been waiting for. Anyway, I love all of them."

Taken on its own, T3 is an OK mishmash of the first 2 films. BUT, coming after a pair of the most influential SF films of the past 2 decades, it's a big letdown. Especially, considering that this wasn't a quickie B-Movie throwaway like in the old days of THE MUMMY'S HAND, HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, REVENGE OF THE CREATURE, RETURN OF THE FLY etc. There, you're expectations weren't as high (as well as the financial stakes, so sometimes you were pleasantly surprised at the outcome - ESCAPE FROM PLANET OF THE APES or FUTUREWORLD being a prime examples).<br/><br/>The money (reportedly over $100M to $150M) is there on screen, but the IDEAS of the first 2 films take a big backseat to MORE Explosions, MORE Action, MORE chases and MORE bad puns. Sorry, but the supposed ""wit"" I kept hearing about fell mostly flat to me and the audience I saw it with (except for one yahoo who hooted and hollered on cue as if on the payroll of WB). Too much of the script simply plays like a series of ""We've got to recycle that"" references and a recitation of studio notes to the writers. Boiled down, the film is almost a remake of T2 (the ever changing and expanding future Alternate Universes going along for the ride).<br/><br/>Still, I can't say it was truly awful or terribly boring. Just not essential. And, the so-called musical ""score"" - horrible, clanking NOISE passing as music. In fact Marco Beltrami's (let's name names here!) score is perhaps the worst you will encounter in a major release in a long long time.

","(possible spoilers) The most disappointed I have ever felt leaving a cinema, was upon leaving this film. I was physically angry at the absolute nonsense that I had just watched. Yes it has an incredible opening car chase. Yes the two terminators fighting looks great and yes Arnie is back, but large explosions and pointless chases does not a good terminator film make.<br/><br/>There are a lot of problems with this film and I won't bother to list all of them. But the T-X is too large a problem to ignore. Where as Robert Patricks' T1000 was the embodiment of terror in T2, Kristana Loken is about as scary and fear inducing as my Nan. She is appalling and has one expression, that of a slightly cheesed off beautician. She looks stupid when she runs and totally unconvincing when she fights. Robert Patrick, I know is committed to the X-files, but they could at least have got someone who could act or fight.<br/><br/>The second problem is Jonathon Mostow, a director who gave us the abysmal and history rewriting U571. OK he manages to pack as many explosions into the film as possible, but what he doesn't seem to grasp is that in the first two films the action is centered around a strong central plot. We care about the characters and the action, when it does happen, is the better for it. Mostow is a person who obviously doesn't understand the word suspense, as unlike the first two films there is no build up, the TX finds John Connor, through Katherine Brewster in a quite ridiculous set piece, inside the first 7mins.<br/><br/>The third problem is the script, or lack of, which is just a reworking of T2 with the TX in place of the superior T100. Thanks to this 'script' Arnie is a 'new and improved' joke telling terminator. Every time Arnie open his mouth the line is played for laughs. He parodies himself so much that it totally destroys the sense of foreboding. Its the end of the world for Christ sake its not meant to be portrayed in this happy-clappy contrary way.<br/><br/>
Had it been just a normal action film, this film would have been good fun. But as a huge fan of the first two films I can't stress enough how frustrated I am. Terminator and T2 were two of the most influential action films ever made, their legacy is apparent in the films produced in the 80's and 90's. A legacy which has been brought to a crashing end by this piece of unimaginative tripe."
"Freakz","9","0","0","4 August 2003"," Why it's the best.
","This is one awesome movie. You get an 5 min. introduction to where we are, who's in it and then it all begins. The plot might be a little on the thinner side of what people might expect, but the action, funny antics, that only is possible in the movie because of what became cool in it's preceding movies. The whole strip club scene is hilarious. The new way they use the fact that Arnold is playing a robot also makes for some funny scenes. Then there is the fight scenes and the spectacular car chase. well just mind blowing action made Matrix style... you'll remember it even if you dont want to.<br/><br/>This movie is nothing like T1 or T2 and it dose not really matter. T1&T2 is history and they made this third chapter in such a manner that it dose not ruin anything of the past two. You can watch the first 2 and complete ignore the third because it begins a new story line of it's own. You can even watch the third movie without knowing much of the former two.<br/><br/>
The plot, characters etc may be in the low end of the scale... But dang it was entertaining to watch.. twice :D<br/><br/>blah blah bad English etc my opinion... :]"

","The first question that came to mind was 'Should I see it?' With no Jim Cameron it seemed a little pointless. However, I had to go have a look. Now that I have, I feel rather indifferent to it. T3 is a high-octane action movie, a great Saturday night popcorn film and lots of fun. And in that respect everything is OK. But next to the other two movies, this film isn't worthy of the Terminator history. T1 was a scary film for me, I saw it when I was still at school especially when Reece tells Sarah that the terminator won't stop till she is dead. T2 was incredible! It kept the essence of T1 without being effected by a bigger budget. These two films had intensity, excellent pacing and PRESENCE. T3 lacked all of these elements. When a terminator in T3 walked or stood and looked at something, you didn't feel their power, and the TX, unfortunately, wasn't intimidating and although the TX had more gadgets that any T model she still seemed inferior to the T1000. Above all else there was no emotional connection to any of the characters including Arnie. The story doesn't jibe that well with the other two films (Didn't Skynet need the Terminator CPU to become aware?) T3 dealt more with fate as where the time travel was a plot device in the other two films rather than a theory to be explored. That's why I will see this as a 'What if' film. A non-official look at what would have happened if everything went wrong.  As far as I am concerned T2 ended the story. James Cameron's absence from the T3 production as a whole was more than noticeable(Act 1 blurred into act 2 and before you knew it - it was the end!). At the end of the day you should still see this film as a bit of entertainment, there's nothing wrong in that at least, and although Arnie looks older, his energy hasn't diminished one bit! 6 out of 10!"

This movie plays up to all the camp developed in the previous two movies and does it quite well.  There are lines that might seem predictable but they are still very funny when delivered, as well as a few new destined-to-be-classics.

","Though not any kind of masterpiece, T3 brings an effective closure to the trilogy (let us pray that T4 never happens) and was a better movie than I thought it would be.<br/><br/>The scope is on the slightly more human scale of the first movie. Of course there are obscene levels of stunts and special effects, but what drew me in was that the notions of fate and consequence were dealt with in a more  - dare I use the word - realistic manner. The sheer terror of the first movie and the operatic melodrama of the second have been brought down to a more plausible scale. One gets more of the feeling that the two human principles are real people. Their flaws are not gigantic tragic flaws, but real qualities of fear, bravery, uncertainty, and shock. This gives more drama and entertainment in their interactions with the two machines.<br/><br/>For it's back to basics philosophy and high entertainment value I give it a solid 8/10."

"panu2000","Null","0","0","1 August 2003"," How T3 continues the trilogy
","As a big fan of Terminator movies I went to see this movie in the first day is was released. I was really interested to see how such a difficult assignment as creating a new episode of legendary Terminator movies could be done.<br/><br/>I remember that I was 14 when I saw the first Terminator movie. For me at that time it was one of the worst scary movies I had ever seen. The last scene when the terminator had only a metal skeleton remaining and it was chasing Sarah Connor in a factory was unforgettable. I don't remember ever being as horrified in a movie.<br/><br/>Then at the age of 21 I saw the Terminator 2. That was another ultimate experience in a different way. It followed the dark atmosphere of the 1st Terminator but also showed an incredible action power in a movie that was never seen before. It was similar enough to the first Terminator but at the same time shocking in its own way. The ""Arnold's jokes"" in the movie became legendary.<br/><br/>So, when I went to see this 3rd episode at the age of 32 I was really curious to see how filmmakers would be able to create another part of the very unique Terminators movies. Well, I try not not repeat all the comments that other people have already said here. It wasn't definitely a bad movie but the feeling I got was that it was too much just copying the nice characters and jokes from T2 and didn't have enough fresh ideas. Maybe only James Cameron would have had enough courage to make a completely new kind of film, copying enough from the previous parts but still creating something new. Now as it is, it left a slight feeling that producers just wanted to get profits with the old bullet proof movie format.<br/><br/>If I say something concrete on the movie, I certainly liked the new sexy TX character and I have to say that she was so good that even that alone would be a good enough reason to watch this movie.  I also liked the Skynet robots that started to rise in the end of the movie. That was slightly touching the atmosphere of the original movies. It was great to see how the judgment day really happened. I also liked Arnold still showing his best action in his 50's. John Connor's character was OK although too far away from the character in T2 to be reliable. The worst thing in the movie was the direction compared to other Terminator movies. Maybe it is just James Cameron's extraordinary skills that made a story flow in the previous episodes but this film seemed more like a row of separate sequences. It was too much repeating the same jokes as seen in T2 and in some sequences this movie was even trying to get cheap credits by making fun of T2 (which I hated).<br/><br/>Well, compared to other movies I've seen recently this is certainly worth to watch. It partly feels like a cheap copy of the previous Terminators but at the same time it gives some enjoyable moments for all the true Terminator fans in a new decade."

","Possible subtle spoilers - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - I feel that Terminator 3 has nothing on the first two movies. However, it is deffinately one for fan boys. The one liners are better than in either of the first. The action sequences are far superior to any of that CG stuff in The Matrix. The plot is satisfactory. Kristanna Loken holds her own, and is deffinately the sexiest killer ever in film. Nick Stahl keeps the dull John Connor role alive. Claire Danes puts on a fairly good performance. Arnie..Well lets face it. Arnie is what we all came for. The Terminator is actually developing a sense of humour; ""Speak to the hand!""<br/><br/>For a film that has over 200 CGI shots, i was suprised at how little it retracted from the film. As with films such as The Matrix, Hulk, and Spy Kids 3-D, the CGI was not showcased. It simply served as an aid for unperformable stunts and special effects! Has Hollywood gone crazy!? I was shocked to find that ILM had actually tried to cover up their special effects, rather than force them down the audeience's throat.<br/><br/>The film moves at a rapid pace, and simply puts the icing on the John Connor saga. The entire story is brought to a close. The T-101 finally reaches it optimal useage. I cannot see there being a T4, for the simple reason that there is nowhere else to take the story. Unless George Lucas gets hold of the rights. Then we will have a series of sequals that actually are prequals, about what is happening at the time of the machine war when the T-101, T-1000 and T-X are sent back in time. There would be three films. The first is when Karl Reece gets sent back, then when the human capture a T-101 and reprogramme it, and finally the birth of John's children. Lets hope not, ay.<br/><br/>I think John Mostow was very brave for taking this on. He had alot of people to please, and i think he has done a pretty good job. Obviously the Terminator films would not be the same without Arnie, but Mostow has proved the he can make a good film, U-571 is forgiven.<br/><br/>Cannot wait for the DVD, to see if they have any alternate endings. Did I mention that it is far better than The Matrix?<br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"saint_me","3","0","0","2 August 2003"," I think this is the ruins of it all.
","As a big fan of the Terminator movies I was in awe of the possibility of a third installment.  Although the chance of wrecking those other two great movies was evident I was quietly hoping for another one.  As long as James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzeneger, Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong were involved and they could explain how the machines have made a come-back decently I would be happy.  Two out of six just isn't good enough.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines is the biggest disappointment I think I'll ever have in my life.  Let's face it we all knew when James Cameron didn't sign up it was going in the wrong direction.  I just didn't realize HOW WRONG.  The appointment of Jonathan Mostow as director wasn't exactly showing the studio were moving hell and high water to give this movie any sort of chance.  Although I hear that the bigwigs cut Mr. Mostow's original T3 to shreds so maybe he isn't THAT bad.  Then we hear that Edward Furlong has been forgotten as John Connor because of drug problems.  Now I don't know about you but if I were in charge of a major franchise such as The Terminator, I would not change the face of the main character in the third movie.  It just cheapens the movie so much and when you go and hire Nick Stahl, a guy who looks nothing like Edward Furlong then your going the right way for a wrong Terminator sequel.  Maybe if the studio waited a few months and actually HELPED Edward out then this movie wouldn't be so fake to the real fans.  Most of you will know that Sarah Connor isn't in this movie. I don't want to spoil this big surprise that you have already worked out but I'll just say it's a storyline that I would be expecting from a Sons & Daughters TV soap episode, not a multi-million dollar budget action movie.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzeneger makes his return as the terminator that we all love so dearly.  He enters in that chaotic fashion as in the first two films in the big disco-ball thingy.  Look at this scene and remember it as this is the last time you will have any sort of love for this movie.  Up comes the ""I need your clothes"" scene.  Humour they call it.  I can't describe the pain I felt while watching this bit...You'll have to experience it for yourself. Arnold isn't the same here.  In the other two movies he was believable and menacing.  His acting is truelly dire here and his character doesn't have any connections with the other's at all.  Where as in the second he was learning stuff and asking questions in this one he's just...there. Kristanna Loken.  She is a mobile phone with legs and a flamethrower compared to the T-1000 from Terminator 2.  Her part in the film makes no sense to me at all.  Skynet would not think that if the next assassin they send out had boobs it would have any sort of advantage.  No...the STUDIO thought that if they had a T-X with boobs they would pull in the male's who are guided by their ""other organ"" and maybe get a sponsorship deal with Kleenex Tissues when the DVD comes out.  The T-X isn't menacing, it isn't scary nor is it big or clever.  It's just...there.  For your viewing pleasure.  Please enjoy while I go throw up into a lucky-bag.<br/><br/>Ah...John Connor.  Living ""off the grid"".  Now before this movie I was led to believe that he was trained ever since he was a small boy to be a huge commando leader type.  Instead we have a puny, moany, cry-baby wuss who I would be able to terminate with an elastic band and a paper-clip.  Nick Stahl isn't the same mould as Furlong.  He doesn't have that same street cred or charm.  He's just...there.  Now the storyline between him and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) was pretty interesting but not enough to save this movie.  All Claire Danes did in this movie was scream and look horrified. It isn't asking much and well...she delivered.  Well done Claire!  You have just shown you are able to do the two most useful things a female can do in a male-dominated movie world.  Maybe you'll be in the next Scream sequel. *yawn*<br/><br/>Now the special-effects were the main attraction of Terminator 2: Judgement Day.  I'm shure they will be passed off as the main attraction here as well. I just don't see why.  The fight scenes were just unbelievable...in a bad way, and the car chase scene although a good idea could have been filmed A LOT better.  To me it just isn't good enough.  You need a good director, good actors and a good script.  All three were atrocious here.  People who love this movie will hold the storyline and the apocalyptic ending (yeah you know how it ends) as their two shining good-points.  The storyline was pretty good but it sets itself up for a tire-some ""I seen this coming a mile away!"" ending that doesn't cut it.  People have been ending their movies on notes like this for so long I was shure it wouldn't be a surprise to anybody.  I haven't even mentioned the score being missing.  You would not believe how much this film misses it.  I was actually humming the tune to the start of the movie because it so obviously should have been there.<br/><br/>Well to sum this movie up, I hated it with all my heart.  They ruined the first two classics and have the sheer audacity to set themselves up for a fourth.  Terminator fans will have to be given some sort of injection to let their grip be realised from the cinema-seats and the rest...well...they can just sit and enjoy their popcorn, the big explosions and the boobs like they are expected to.<br/><br/>3/10"

","POTENTIAL SPOILERS<br/><br/>Whilst the 1st Terminator was a dark subtle matter (and admittedly my favourite of the three), the 2nd moved onto a more mainstream easy watching platform. This film continues on from number 2 & doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Whilst admittedly it has none of the major thought processes that I'm usually keen on. There's something amazing about just being able to watch Arnie driving around beating people up again.<br/><br/>Truth be told, the only thing I have a flaw with this film, and I'm probably the only one, is the T-X. I can't help but feel that whilst Loken (is that the proper spelling of her name?) makes a fair effort, I just can't take her seriously as a threat to mankind. I just feel with a better choice in outfit & without hair tied back in a way which makes her look like she should be wearing a suit in an office somewhere, would have made her more of a threat. In the end of the day though, this just feels like some sort of equal rights idea. It makes me wonder what will happen in Terminator 4 (and there WILL be another). Will they try & combine the first type of Terminator with Arnie's type & create some sort of Terminator Paverotti? Could even create a Terminator Dog or something. Despite all my negatives regarding Loken however, the same concerns were probably made about Patrick's T1000 in Terminator 2. <br/><br/>Despite the occasional concerns though, this is still an entertaining film.

","Apart from the last 5 minutes ( which are truly excellent ) this has to rank as one of the worst films ever. The first hour is simply t2 with an vastly inferior terminator to the T100 ( budget, morphing costs ). The first 2 movies had well crafted scripts. T3 simply jumps to & from various set pieces leaving massive holes in the plot. Arnie almost places his role as a spoof of the original 2 movies, what where the sunglasses all about???<br/><br/>The humour in the original 2 movies played heavily on the complete lack of emotions in a robot(cyborg) and was for the most part very dark.<br/><br/>
The hole idea around the terminator is that he's a ruthless killing machine ( who taught him not to kill HUMANS in this movie??????? )<br/><br/>
The movie was clearly aimed at a younger audience to boost revenue. It has all the hallmarks of action movies from past decade ( excessive reliance on gadgets )and is very much a late nineties take on the terminator.

","(Spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>Anyone expecting this film to build on the T1 and T2 legacy (I was) will be disappointed. However, the film as its own entity is one of the best action films released in a long time.<br/><br/>Looking back, it seems inevitable that T3 should go this route. In T1 we had genuine fear and desperation as the ""unstoppable"" terminator stalked its prey. In this respect T2 sold out the original for the sake of a good action film packed full of special effects. Admittedly T2 had a good plot including addressing the destiny/fate dilemma and the hope/despair of mankind's future. So where then will T3 go? Risk going back to the gritty original and alienate all the T2 fans? I think not.<br/><br/>T3 moves forward into the action genre. Big fights, fancy weapons, glittering effects - none of these disappoint. The plot gets too caught up in the ""it's your destiny"" loop and doesn't really explore any of the time dilemmas. The ending is inevitable but leads us nicely on to T4.<br/><br/>So, given the drawbacks mentioned above, did I like the film? The answer is a resounding ""yes"". Once I realised that this film should be treated as a *Terminator Action Franchise* I sat back and lapped it up. On leaving the cinema and felt contented that I had been well entertained for 2 hours.<br/><br/>I must take a paragraph to talk about the humour in this film. This IS a funny film. While not normally a fan of dumb humour, I did laugh out loud at several points. The dead-pan deliver given by Arnie is excellent and well-timed and fitted well with the feel of the movie.<br/><br/>In summary, you must watch this film if you like action movies with interesting storylines.

it' is an awesome movie, the best of it it's that it combines suspense, non stop action, some emotion and humor :)  Arnold delivers a great performance, as always.  Nick Stahl is pretty good and very convincing as John Connor, and Claire Dannes does a great job as well.  Especial mention to Kristianna Loken as the female terminator,  her character is very convincing and she manages to show a total lack of emotions and feelings, just the way a Terminator should be.  Plus the plot is great, the dialogs are clever and the many twists of this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire movie!<br/><br/>All of those who love a good action movie, and especially, love Arnold, see it!!!

","...that's the only fault with the movie. There is a stack of rewatchable action but far too much of Arnie from the future knowing everything and so speaking the plot, and cue stupefied reactions from Danes and Stahl. Done last film, to excess, and so despite the top-notch action, this movie feels thin and Avid-edited to the bare bones.<br/><br/>This is The Machines Strike Back and does the workmanlike setup job well- and the ending's very ballsy for a summer film. Then again none of the Terminator movies ended particularly happily.<br/><br/>Please C2/Intermedia, get T4 going within the next five years and stop cheating the audience- give us the future war (and not just in dreams or flashbacks/flashforwards) which will round off the series nicely- even split it into two. Whatever happens, we can't be waiting another decade for it when the technology for the effects is here now. T4 cannot be yet another retread of T2, please."

","When it said Certificate 12A - I just knew that this was not going to impress me very much at all.  I'm going to keep this brief and I would like to point out at this point that this is my opinion of the film.<br/><br/>Terminator 1 & 2 are timeless classics; violent and explosive with a very well thought out and deeply profound story at the heart driving it along - it is that mixture that made them classics.  The effects were not over-done, they were charming for their simple look in T1, a look that was greatly complex at the time.  The Terminator was cool, he was a monster and you could see why Sarah Connor was afraid of him.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 is quite simply, a terrible sequel that spoils the Terminator series.  When you start catering for the kids in the cinema then a movie like this loses all credibility and becomes exactly what this movie is - a 'Boom' movie.  'How many elements can we computerise in this movie without actually replacing human beings?' wonders Jonathan Mostow and the people on my hitlist who wrote it and forgot to include a decent story.  Talk about grabbing at straws.<br/><br/>This movie is NOT a Terminator movie.  Cameron's vision and his masterpiece has been spoiled, defacated upon by these movie amateurs who quite obviously do not share that mans fastidiousness and need for perfection.  People in the cinema were laughing - LAUGHING!!!  Termintaor is not a comedy.  And how many people does he Terminate?  None!<br/><br/>I think the T - X should not have been played by the girl; I think Robert Patrick should have been brought back to play the improved Termintor as he's got an evil and sinister look about him.  Arnold - well it can't be done without him, but he needed some juicing up.   This is NOT a Termintor movie as I said.  This is a kids film with a bit of blood and should never have gone ahead.<br/><br/>10 years or so in the making and the biggest disappointment since The Matrix Reloaded.<br/><br/>No Story.  No Termintor violence.  Too much CG!<br/><br/>Poor, guys.  Very Poor!<br/><br/>2/10"

","T3 had a great potential, but the hopes were just too high. After T2, doing something better would have been a titan's work. Mostow goes for the heavy action style, long car chase, big explosions...but somehow forgets to deliver the kind of atmosphere Cameron could. I do not revere Cameron as a god, but he was better at it than Mostow is.<br/><br/>The evil Terminatrix is somehow silly. She has part liquid metal-part solid metal frame, and therefore can be broken just like old Arnie, but unlike THE Patrick's T1000. The machines must have employed a very uncompetent R&D cyborg. Loken is OK, but does not give this ""run as fast as you can I will catch you one day"" attitude Robert Patrick or Arnie could give us. On the first moments of the action TX is already temporary down and needs to recompose itself...after having been run over by a car and burried under some blocks of concrete...tsktsktsk. Oh yes, and she can control other machines. Other cyborgs, robots or computers, I accept, but cars, trucks and vans, that's silly.<br/><br/>Although I laughed at the jokes, they contributed to the loss of atmosphere. They were just too many, and too silly sometimes.<br/><br/>If you accept that the story didn't end with T2 (I mean, even if I blew up Microsoft headquarters, put Bill Gates on a box full of C4, we would still see our PC invaded by Windows version 2024, right?), then T3 doesn't make too much nonsense. All they did in T2 was to delay Judgment Day. Ok, I accept that gladly. The end of T3 was quite nicely done and refreshingly surprising, before giving us a ""see you in T4"" final ending.<br/><br/>An average to good action movie, but you have to forget how good was the first 2 movies. In fact, it could almost be a parody.<br/><br/>I think Arnie was what put this movie so high in the hype. Arnie IS still in good shape after all.

","I am writing this review fresh from visiting my local multiplex, viewing the latest installment of the Terminator series ""T3: Rise of the Machines"". I am a huge fan of the first two films directed by James Cameron and can only feel sympathy for Jonothan Mostow in trying to fill those boots. But then I just ask why did he bother? Cameron wrapped the whole story up very well in the sad conclusion of T2, and I can see why he baulked at the opportunity of helming a second sequel. I can see it even more when he read the script for T3. You can only imagine the meeting. 'Hi Mr. Cameron we would like to look at our script for T3'. 'A script for T3. But that was my idea. I thought up the whole thing. Why are you making a sequel to something I ended so brilliantly the first time around?'. 'Yes Mr. Cameron, but there's going to be lots of special effects...and a big car chase...and, er'. This was the biggest problem, although The Terminator and T2 by genre are a horror and a action film respectively, Cameron did convey a convincing moral message about the future of humanity, in his storyline through the relationships of his central characters to one another. This was shown through Reece's love for Sarah Conner (which even transends time) and the most human trait of all being a mother's love for her son, between Sarah and her son John. Apposed to these very human relationships is the cold, destructive, emotionless machine, the Terminator. Unfortunatly these elements had been threwn out in the script for this film, and therefore nothing for the viewer to attach themselves too. As for the cast Arnie was dependably wooden as ever for the role of the T-101 (how he kept a straight face for some of the one liners IS amazing). I haven't seen much of Nick Stahl (played John Conner)before but he seemed wrong for the role (didn't seem to have the street smarts Ed Furlong had in T2) and Care Danes seemed to be confused as to what her role was supposed to be. The one saving grace of this film was Kristanna Loken as the T-X. She stole the film (don't the bad guys always do this?) and looked like she really relished the role, I thought she was a real jewel. Hats of again to ILM, who although not superceding anything the Matrix sequels have done (I'm assuming Matrix Revolutions will blow our socks off), they continue to impress. So overall, I thought T:3 was a bit of a waste of time, and Mr. Cameron will probably be sat smugly thinking 'I knew I was right all along!'"
"ozzmosiz","7","0","0","31 July 2003"," A great second sequel
","After watching T3 for the first time I thought I would write up my review.<br/><br/>
T3 kicks off with an introduction by John Conner describing the way he has lived his life since the last installment, this sets up the story without having to reintroduce his character. This allows the action to flow, and boy does it come at you non-stop, watch out for the street chase, unlike another film that I will not mention, the stunts were actually done for real. T1 was an awe-inspiring concept of a story and held no punches with the violence. T2 was an epical science fiction special/visual effects extravaganza. T3 tends to fall in between in terms of violence and visual/special effects with a hint more humour than T3, most of it blatant.<br/><br/>The length of the film is shorter than its predecessor to ensure the film never lets up. The storyline is similar to T2 but has other elements added in to ensure that is also interesting.<br/><br/>Overall it's a fantastic film in my opinion, it does differ to the other two installments, but this helps to ensure that things don't become stale, although it does fall slightly short of T2 but not much."

","I went into this not expecting much - it's been 12 years since T2, Arny's now 56 and James Cameron's not directing.<br/><br/>Well, I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. Kristanna Loken as the T-X was perfect; menacing and unstoppable throughout the film. Arny looks as impressive as he did in T2 and must have worked hard to get back into that kind of shape; it's incredible to think he's almost 60! Claire Danes was very good as the love interest and bewildered heroine of the story and Nick Stahl was excellent as the young John Connor. <br/><br/>The story was very good - it leads up to an exciting climax which surely paves the way for yet another Terminator sequel and the action set pieces were superb! Well done to Jonathan Mostow for pulling this off, a very enjoyable and logical addition to this important franchise."
"powerfully_attractive","Null","0","0","31 July 2003"," Good, but not as good as T2
","Firstly let me start by saying ""its about time they made a sequel to 1991's T2, which broke box office records for that year.""<br/><br/>In my heart, I always knew that nothing would compare to T2. T2 gives me goosebumps when I watch it, it makes me cry. Considering its extremley far fetched, it still has meaning and looks cool.<br/><br/>Now T3, I'm not complaining. It was a good movie, enjoyable and the special effects were spectacular. HOwever, it didnt really feel as special as T2. It just seemed like a ""movie"" nothing extrodinary. In my view this kind of thing had been done before. Back in 1991, it was new fresh and exciting. Although its still exciting, its not new and fresh anymore and I was somewhat dissapointed.<br/><br/>ON the other hand, it was good to see Arnie back again. And yes I really enjoyed the fact that the TX was a woman. A very attractive woman, i heard yelps and howls in the cinema when we saw her behind in the begining of the film.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl and Claire Daines also do a good job and are believable in the characters that they play. But in my view they could have put them in better surroundings, instead of a small vet shop.<br/><br/>The action started off tooo quick and didnt really give the chance for the audience to get to know some of the characters or how arnie exactly found thier location in the first place, he just sort of showed up.<br/><br/>
Furthermore, there isnt any emotion like there was in T2. Its just like the terminator was there and they didnt really develop any kind of relationship. All in all, i didnt really know what to expect when I went to see T3. I did know however, that it wouldnt have been as good as T2.<br/><br/>I do recomend that you go and see it, you wont be dissapointed. But chances are you might enjoy the second sequel better than the third."
"sdillon-1","6","0","0","4 August 2003"," Surprisingly enjoyable.
","The Terminator and Terminator 2:Judgment Day are, respectively, a science fiction classic, and a worthy sequel to a science fiction classic.  They are both brilliantly written and directed by James Cameron, the finest action director in the world.  As well as being excellent action-packed stories, they have great emotional impact and contain an interesting message about the value of human life.  They also manage to be simultaneously pessimistic and optimistic as the heroes of the story struggle to prevent a future apocalypse.  Whether or not they succeed is left brilliantly ambiguous. <br/><br/>
The close of Terminator 2 seemed like a fantastic ending.  Continuing it, I always thought would be a truly terrible idea, especially with James Cameron not at the helm.  Therefore, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines sounded like a cynical exercise in revitalising Arnold Schwarzenegger's flagging career. Unlike the first two films, it has not been made for any artistic or creative reason.<br/><br/>It comes as a great surprise then, that Terminator 3 is actually rather enjoyable.  It's nowhere near as good as its illustrious predecessors, but its certainly more entertaining than, say, The Matrix Reloaded.  Although director Jonathan Mostow lack's Cameron's flair, he's always solid and delivers some fine action set pieces.  Unfortunately, that's all he does deliver.  Terminator 3 is full of action, but it has precious little character development and lacks the emotional core of the earlier films. That is, until the last five minutes of the film which I won't spoil here.<br/><br/>The plot is the same as ever, with Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 terminator once more sent back in time to protect John Conner (Nick Stahl) from yet another terminator upgrade, the female T-X (Kristanna Loken).  The T-X is a kind of cross between the liquid metal terminator of Terminator 2 and Arnie's mechanical version.  However, this time it has other targets beside Conner, including his wife-to-be Kathryn Brewster (Claire Danes).  It transpires the nuclear war Conner thought had been prevented in Terminator 2 has only been `postponed' (completely destroying the logic of previous instalments).  This leads to a race against time, which fails to be anywhere near as suspenseful as it should be.<br/><br/>The cast are all good, if unremarkable.  However, the script has an annoying habit of delivering the signature dialogue with a nod and a wink.  Lines like `Come with me if you want to live' and `I'll be back' no longer have the resonance they had in the earlier films, and simply become irritating. As for Arnie, he's good, but no longer has the edge he had in the earlier films.  I doubt this film will resurrect his career."
"OllieZ","6","0","0","3 August 2003"," Has a lot to live up to...
","Right I'll say it now - the best was the first, the second best was Judgement day and this new installment finishes in last place.  It lacks the dramatic impact,  the cool, sophisticated direction or the ""feel"" of the last two movies.  This doesn't however make this film bad, as it was rather entertaining, a lot better than The Matrix Reloaded, or any other films this year(except Whale Rider and Pirates of the ...).          The action is pretty relentless, and well done, with great camera work, some pretty violent scenes (for a 12A) and great set pieces - the toilet scene between Arnie and Loken is great, perfect action scene - much better than the overblown rubbish seen in Matrix Reloaded.  All of the action is tied together with great special effects, which, while not as stunning as T2 in its day, is great work.  Highlights are Arnies face being smashed in, and Loken's character having all her metal come off. <br/><br/>          Acting is good, especially from Nick Stahl, who did well to carry on the role of Furlongs John Conner.  He plays it with great style and makes us feel that this character has a burden to carry.  Claire Danes is okay as Conners girl, yet she lacks depth, and just seems to be shouting and screaming.  Oh well.  Arnie is really good, he plays the terminator role with ease, yet some scenes he seems to playing a parody of his formr roles as the machine.  Also he isn't quite as well equipped in the one liners department, and seems to just get stuff from the prequels.  Still overall, he is good, and really doesn't look his age!  Lastly, Loken plays the bad guy in this movie, and although she is the worst ""baddie"" the series has seen (I'll say Arnies first role was the most menacing, T2 had the most cool), she still had lots of impressive tricks up her sleeve.  Or cleveage. Her acting was good, menacing and brooding, just like a killing machine should be like. So far so good, good action scenes, consistent acting - whats missing?  Other than James Cameron, whose flair is obviously lacking, it's the music.  The great theme tune from the prequels is gone, which left me cold in some scenes, and the action scenes lacked some oomph because of this.  The music, if included, would have made this movie a little better - more tense. Overall, a good action flick, not as good as the first two masterpieces, but a worthy addition to the series nonetheless.  It seems to have been catered for the spoilt brats of the cinema going audience, as it's only a 12A, yet it still had some gruesome moments, and overall is very entertaining.<br/><br/>

","Well, I have to say that I enjoyed T3.  It was not a taught B-movie thriller like T1, or a faultless big budget sci-fi classic like T2, but it certainly entertained for 2 hours without getting boring.  (I couldn't say the same of the other summer blockbuster I saw recently, ""Hulk"".  I had to see that twice to check I wasn't imagining how BAD it was the first time.)<br/><br/>***** contains mild SPOILERS ******<br/><br/>T3 doesn't really bother trying to explain why Terminators even continue to exist post the seemingly ""final"" events of T2, instead it attempts to capture the audience's attention, with the promise of some impressive stunts, action sequences and effects (right from the opening shot of a nuclear detonation), and a large helping of ""more of the same"".<br/><br/>It certainly delivers on more of the same, with some great action sequences (T-X driving the crane was particularly good), nice effects, and constant pursuit of John Connor by a particularly mean, seeming unstoppable (and this time not unattractive) machine (apologies to Robert Patrick!), which again is defeated in an ingenious manner.<br/><br/>Where it fell down for me was:<br/><br/>1)  it lacked the originality of either of it's predecessors, both in terms of plot, and in terms of set pieces (I guess there are only so many ways a machine can bash another machine into a wall repeatedly, but Arnie shooting up loads of cops then do a ""000"" count of human victims?  Surely we've seen that before!) 2)  it had a few too many attempts at humour (that is how we spell ""humor"" it in England BTW), which I think robbed it of the tension of the earlier movies.  For ever slice of ""talk to the hand"" genius, there was a dog line (""I'm back!"" was easily the worst).<br/><br/>But overall, it was more fun to watch than a lot of blockbusters I've seen recently.  I'm not likely to hold my breath for the DVD, but i'd recommend seeing it, just don't expect to be blown away the way T2 would have done."

","The key to T3 is not to go in with high expectations; think of it as it's going to be like ""The Matrix Reloaded"". The outcome, at least for me, was that I wasn't disappointed. It is a decent summer popcorn flick that lives up to its predecessors. It's definitely ten times better than the second Matrix in all aspects: storyline, special effects, acting. Yes, sure it could have been better; nevertheless T3 is probably the best action movie of this kind since the first Matrix.<br/><br/>Arny was good in his role as hi was in the previous two installments. He was born for this role no doubt about it. The only thing that annoyed me was that he was ""programmed"" to talk too much. The creators of the movie should've found another way to explain what was happening. Maybe I'm wrong but it just felt a little bit more than was needed. Even the self-parodying lines were too many and not so cool. Moving on to Kristanna Loken (T-X) I'd say she tried her best to fill in the shoes of Robert Patrick who's gonna be remembered forever (whether he likes it or not) with his role in T2 as T-1000. The idea of a sexy terminatrices was a very good indeed, however due to writing limitations the character wasn't explored well enough which brings me to the second problem with this movie. T-X being much more sophisticated and tough to deal with after all was destroyed by our man so much easier than he did T-1000. And what was all this dismantling and screaming at the end. Anyway, I think the best acting came from Claire Danes probably the most convincing one. As I think again Nick Stahl performance was not bad at all. Actually the whole casting was pretty good as were the special effects. The CGI were kept to minimum which was good, very good ... sorry I am having again some flash backs from the CGI in the second Matrix - terrible. Let me get back to T3. I think I can't. I am too upset now.<br/><br/>While T3 is not as original and memorable as T1 and T2 classics, it still manages to deliver what is set out to do- a high-budget, cold metal entertainment for the hot summer days. For all the fans of the ""Terminator"" franchise and for all those disappointed with the second Matrix and just for all of you out there I recommend this movie. The first group won't be disappointed, the second will be relieved and the third, well I just hope you like it."

","After a gap of over 10 years I was a bit hesitant about watching the third part of the story, and left the theatre with mixed emotions, as although good with a stunning main chase sequence something was missing in T3, and it was the darkness and hard edge of T1 and T2 that Cameron produced.<br/><br/>It was strange not seeing Linda Hamilton, and her character dieing of leukaemia and then cremation tangent to remove her character just somehow didn't sound right considering what a strong character she'd developed into in T2.<br/><br/>Big Arnie was as awesome on screen as only he can be, but he's starting to look his age, and at times I got the feeling he was playing his character for laughs, and with clinches going back to T1 and T2. But, why didn't he kill anyone besides the TX, he is after all a terminator? I hope it isn't due to south California PC attitudes getting into the movies.  Plus with a possible nuclear war coming the story wasn't as stressful and dark as it should have been.<br/><br/>Beautiful Kristanna Loken was very efficient as the unfeeling TX, but she's not as cold as Robert Patrick was in T2, but she was one ice maiden as emotionless and as ruthless given that T3 has a different feel to T2.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl although a bit whiney at the start, and Claire Danes in a very ballsey role grew into their respective characters, and if T4 to finish the story off gets made before Arnie gets to old they can develop and mature their characters.<br/><br/>On a lighter note it was nice to see Earl Boen again although like Arnie he's now showing his age, but it was a case of blink and you'd miss his small part.<br/><br/>As for 'Skynet' I hope more of how it works is explained in T4, as we only got a taste of the nature of the chief villain.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I personally think to long has passed between T2 and T3, and if Cameron isn't going to direct T4, I hope Jonathan Mostow gives T4 the cold dark edge of T1 and T2 to get back some lost ground.<br/><br/>I give T3 8 out of 10 for the great stunts and a good foundation for the final movie."

","I had heard rumours that this movie wasn't that good so I was getting nervous when I sat down to watch it.  I came out extremely satisfied that the movie was VERY good.  I won't spoil the storyline but it is so open for a Terminator 4 at the end that I wouldn't be surprised if we see another addition to the series soon.  Only problem with that is if they don't shoot the movie soon then Arnie would be too old. Back to the film.  Although not as dark as the first Terminator movie, this brings alot of realism to the fact that we are in a nuclear age and the graphic reality of a possible nuclear war.  I left the movie feeling happy with the special effects (but Arnie still can't act) but a bit depressed with the ever possible threat of, apart from Terminators running around, the severe threat of our own real life nuclear war.  Let's face it the amount of computers that do control our defence systems in this country could always malfunction and any backup system to prevent this from happening could also go wrong as well.  Depressed you yet?????  Think about it........<br/><br/>(Slight spoiler) The budget of this movie was amazing (I have forgotten the actual figure but I think it's around 170 million US dollars) and one can see where they blew alot of their cash, like the first chase scene with a fire truck and a large crane truck through the streets pursing John Connor. Wow that was good. I was expecting more T800's running around in an extended futuristic scene at the beginning and one can only hope that in T4 there will be.  I had heard that there was about 10 minutes of T800's shooting at the beginning but T2 had more of that than this one so I was disappointed.  I also feel that the UK cinema rating (BBFC) organization must of had a back hand deal from the movie studios to reduce the certification as it's ""R"" in the states and over here it's 12a. For non UK citizens this means that children under the age of 12 can attend to view but must be accompanied by an adult. (Spoiler) Well for those who have watched it, would you really want a 7 year old to see the scene in the cop car where the TX is controlling the steering wheel through the cops stomach that it just punched through??? Gross!!! This movie should have been a 15 in the UK and shame on the BBFC for not doing so. Watch this movie for serious Hollywood big budget special effect action and see just how depressing they leave the ending - T4 must be round the corner, hopefully Arnie won't be drawing his pension when they get around to shooting it. Make sure the cinema you view this film in has a great sound system as you will love all the explosions and bullets flying around you."

","Having not seen either of the first two movies at the cinema, I had to see this one, to make up for lost time. I don't think it is as good as the others, but it is as good as can be expected, considering the fact that the storyline had seemingly reached its end in 1991. There are some flat scenes, but these are far outnumbered by the terrific action sequences which make you just sit there in awe at the apparent real-life mayhem caused, particularly in the first set-piece, which must be one of the all-time great carnage spectacles, although I thought the crash in 'Final Destination 2' was pretty magnificent, too. Arnie is back with a vengeance, and somehow his acting, although still very much tongue in cheek, is quite good here. The grown-up John Connor is OK, and Claire Danes is adequately effective, if in the Ist Division to Linda Hamilton's Premier one. However, the main attraction here is the beautifully evil and totally believable Katrianna Loken. Her screen presence is enormous, and she acts with such confidence that it all seems perfectly plausible that the next high-tech generation of Terminators would be women...after all, they are taking over the world, aren't they? The film is worth seeing for the amazing stunts, and to marvel at KL's beauty, which, literally, knocks you out. As I said, if she's the Terminator, what a way to go..."

","I saw this turkey whit an open and virgin mind. I had managed to avoid all trailers and spoilers and had no preconceptions about the movie. This WAS an important movie and deserved my full first time reaction to it. Sadly this movie is Episode I&II, Alien 4 and Robocop 3 all over again. Atypical Hollywood third act in a brilliant series UNTIL NOW! As you can read from the goofs page and see in the movie some one didn't do their home work and didn't pay attention on the set, reading the script and in editing! Mr. Mostow what have you got to say for your self? This is a pitiful sequel! The plot AND action are SO full of holes that you can use this as a fishing net. The future will agree whit the people who think this is scum. T3 will end up being the almost unmentioned third movie in the DVD box set. Most people will newer even take it out of the box. Why would you want to? Who wants to invite the guy that spoils the party? The premise promises a watch able movie, but the execution fall flat on its face. It manages to fly for about 45 minutes if you excuse the constant ""action"" bloopers that you are used to seeing in 80's action but this is T3 not Commando 2. All I can hope is that T4 is newer made and they release a dir.cut DVD whit 60 min of new footage (please omit 30 min from the end!) and 20 min of added length. There are only 2 good thins in T3 the new terminator, she is sexy and a nice ""robot"" and the nasty action in the beginning in the T1 style of ""are you Sarah Connor? BANG!"" They should have gotten Paul Verhoeven to direct...<br/><br/>Please don't buy this DVD."

","While it's not as gripping and wickedly entertaining as the original, Terminator 3 is still well worth the wait and is an exhilarating experience from start to finish. <br/><br/>The action never lets up and there is no sugarcoating the nonstop brutal violence of the film. Kristanna Loken as the T-X is very hot and stone cold in her role as her emotionless killer robot. Arnie is great once again, proving that no-one does the terminator better than him. Apart from that he is also in amazing shape for his age and his physical presence is still very intimidating and overwhelming in the film. Whereas T2 deals with preventing judgement day and the end of the world for humans, T3 deals with preparing for it and the rise of the machines.<br/><br/>My only criticisms are that Edward Furlong should have kept his role as John Connor. Also Sarah Connor just being abandoned in the story is wrong in my opinion and the casting of Claire Danes seems to have been thrown in just for grins. But the movie does have some very funny moments, which are a blessing. The special effects are the most mind-blowing in the series so far, and the action scenes are never less than spectacular. So if you are an Arnie or Terminator fan, or just a moviegoer in my opinion, T3 is without a doubt a must-see. Along with The Matrix Reloaded, T3 is definitely my fav film of the year.<br/><br/>I give Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines an 8/10."

","Like a good Terminator fan-boy, I reacted with child-like excitement when I first heard that there would be a T3. That excitement soon turned to disappointment and eventually despair when I learned that James Cameron would not return to direct, and Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong would not reprise their roles as the Connors.<br/><br/>But then the reviews started to come in, and I was given hope... but then I remembered feeling the same way about The Phantom Menace and coming out of the cinema feeling like a part of my life had just been stolen. So, I promised myself I would not give in to the hype. I would be prepared for a bad Terminator movie.<br/><br/>I needn't have bothered! This film rocks!<br/><br/>Okay, so it doesn't top the mind-bogglingly epic all round perfection of T2, but it's still a helluva film, and a worthy addition to the series. The story is a good one, and it fleshes out the Terminator universe in ways you might not expect. It also raises interesting questions about fate vs. determinism that my brain still hasn't fully digested (hey, I just got back from the cinema five minutes ago!), and which provide the perfect excuse to watch the old films just one more time...<br/><br/>Nick Stahl is excellent as John Connor. In T2 we saw how Sarah had transformed from a fluffy pink girl into the action queen, hardened by the knowledge that she had to prepare John for Judgement Day. Well, time has had a different effect on her son. Haunted by nightmares of Judgement Day, living in denial about the events of T2, he is forever paranoid that one day the machines will come back for him. His fear has made him weak, and when Judgment Day comes, he doesn't feel ready. Stahl portrays this self-doubt brilliantly, while never leaving the audience in doubt that he really is the one who will lead the resistance.<br/><br/>Claire Danes is also good as the woman who finds her life drawn into chaos, trying to make sense of the fact that this unfamiliar path is in fact her destiny. She has just the right balance of human frailty and future-heroine-badassness.<br/><br/>Earl Boen makes a welcome cameo, though his role is really nothing more than an easter egg for Terminator geeks. The other supporting actors are good enough in their respective roles, but very little screen time is given to any minor characters.<br/><br/>Kristianna Loken isn't nearly as menacing as Robert Patrick was, but then the film isn't really about the heroes vs. the T-X in the way that T1 and T2 were about the protagonists vs. Arnie and Robert Patrick respectively. Certainly, the film needed a Terminator that was different to the original two, and sequel logic dictates that she had to be more dangerous than either of them. She was, but she didn't scare the s**t out of me the way the other two did.<br/><br/>Last, but certainly not least, the man himself. He said he'd be back, and he wasn't lying. Arnie's part is well written  he is not the Terminator that was incinerated at the end of T2, and neither does he follow that Terminator's character arc. I was hoping for more to be made of the 'is he good or bad' plot device that was promised to us, but I guess there wasn't really room. Of course, it was great to have Arnie  it wouldn't have been a Terminator movie without him  but at times I felt he was playing the part for laughs, which felt wrong. Even though some of his lines were genuinely funny, I thought that Mostow should have resisted the temptation and kept the tone darker.<br/><br/>Naturally, there will be die-hards who will refuse to accept that a new Terminator movie could possibly be anything other than sacrilege, but I would suggest they go see it anyway. The sooner they see it, the sooner the nostalgia will set in and they can feel about T3 the same as they feel about T2 and T1. (Let's face it, T2 was a completely different movie to T1, but we still love it, so give T3 a chance.) Jonathon Mostow has brought the series to a point that if T4 were made, it wouldn't even need a leading role for Arnie, provided that Stahl and Danes are available. (He would have to appear at some point, but as a bad guy. His statement to Connor 'We'll meet again' wasn't so much a promise as a future historical fact  if you go see T3 you'll see what I mean about half way through.)<br/><br/>And there should be a T4. Mostow has proved that even without Cameron, this is a franchise worth building on. (And let's face it, Jimbo seems to have lost his way lately anyway.) There is still a huge story to tell."

","I came out of this movie with mixed emotions. The special effects were good, the chases were tense and the backstory of this new Terminator's relationship with John Connor was clever. Still, there was a fatalism throughout the movie that reduced the impact of the ending. The movie essentially says to us, ""This is the way things will turn out...things are turning out as I predicted...I was right, this was the way turned out."" Not only does this ruin suspense, but it also means that whenever someone dies in the picture, instead of pitying the dead, we shrug and move on. It alienates us from the movie and its characters when we want to feel close, and by the end my reaction to the story paralleled that of the kid in The Princess Bride who screams, ""Jeez, grampa, why did you want to tell me this story!"""

The second time I saw it I was starting to warm towards it and took the scene and line stealing as what I am sure it was intended, a homage to the first movies.<br/><br/>The action scenes were fairly good - Arnie could still cut it reasonably well as the terminator despite his age. The new terminator resembled the characteristics (the mannerisms not the physicality) of the T-1000 (Robert Patric) from T2 and this sorts of fits with the whole improved terminator line, i.e. less robotic more human. There were some glaring holes which although I tried hard I could not ignore<br/><br/>Spoiler possibility (I will keep as vague as possible) The secret base was stunningly unguarded, in fact most of the military establishments appear to have an open door policy for strangers :-)<br/><br/>I won't go into anymore but there are some<br/><br/>One of the things I did not like at all was the development of the John Connor character.

In the third movie John Connor appears to have had a personality change. He seems like a frightened and confused child - not at all like the strong willed resourceful character from the second film. This grated on me a bit as he seemed very whiny and weak in this movie.<br/><br/>The  ending was reasonably good - covering the ""The future is not fixed"" sort of scenario and therefore allowing the rules to be broken from one movie to the next in a reasonably sensible way (As sensible as you can get with time travel movies).<br/><br/>Summary Direction - nice and fast paced - all you would expect from a T2 movie.

I knew going into it that it wasn't going to be the next Citizen Cane, but this movie was missing many fundamental features of a movie. First they relied way to heavily on the prior movies explaining this one. Unless you watched the first two, the movie didn't make much sense. I think Velveeta made this movie, because it was cheesy. All of the silly cliché catch phrases made me wonder if it was on purposed to mock itself or mock us. Arnold should be ashamed of himself for even uttering some of those lines. There was no real plot development; it was more like one giant chase scene(which was very cool). I mean if that's what you're interested in.... That brings us to the end of the movie.

The second half of T3 is as mis-directed as the Terminatix's mission, which keeps changing. Besides the hoary cliche scene where the Terminator is wrestling for his soul, there are several scenes where you can sense the movie go off track: 1)  In T2, during the ""Hasta la vista"" scene, the T-1000 begins to reform right before his prey, heightening their horror.  But in T3, when Stahl and Danes have impaled and they assume left for dead the Terminatrix on the supermagnet, they are long gone on some other adventure by the time she begins to free herself. 2)  Why does she need a gun to kill her victims when she can shoot electrical bolts? 3)  How do the heavily-armed Terminator and the kids enter the secret Air Force base?  How does the Terminatrix?<br/><br/>So much is left unexplained, in comparison to T2, in which you get to see how the T-1000 stalked its prey.

","T3 is a great movie. In a way, it's everything a great action movie should be and nothing it shouldn't. It contains some good-ol' fashioned action movie elements like car-chases, explosions, combat scenes, etc. It also contains the mandatory odd humour and romantic undertones. However, just like with any action movie, there are flaws, and since this is a sequel to one of the best action movies of all time, these flaws are perhaps more serious.<br/><br/>In all honesty, a third Terminator film should never have been made, even IF James Cameron came on board again. T2 pretty much wrapped things up as Cyberdyne was destroyed, thus eliminating any chance of a machine-dominated future. The plot of T3 makes T2's plot null-and-void. One cannot help but feel that the entire integrity of T2 is destroyed: it's like the events that happened in T2 were meaningless. T3 was obviously created to needlessly cash-in on the Terminator franchise.<br/><br/>However, if you somehow succeed in forgetting everything you knew about the first two films, T3 wouldn't seem all that bad. As mentioned, it was made well and you do get a sense of closure at the end of the film, which is increasingly rare to find in films these days. While the script is somewhat inconsistent and the dialogue crude, the movie as a whole stands up pretty well, thanks to some great action sequences. Personally, I didn't like the idea that T-800 wasn't the same protector as the one we learned to love in T2. His character fails to develop as he did in T2. In fact, Arnold's character seems to combine the best parts of the T-800 from the first film and the second one. Nick Stahl does a great job portraying John Connor, albeit giving him a new sense of values. I would've preferred to see Edward Furlong reprising his character as there was clearly a chemistry between him and Schwarzenegger in the second film. Stahl definitely has the qualities of a man leading others against the machines, but I got used to Furlong playing bratty child-like Connor.<br/><br/>Apart from these flaws, the movie is otherwise very enjoyable to watch.

","**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>""T-3"" is a straightforward picture, setting the stage in the opening twenty minutes, then propelling its characters into what is basically a chase movie for the final hour and a half. Sound familiar? Well, why mess with success? Although it may sound boring and routine, the movie is neither. The script and pacing are both tight and constantly in motion, leaving no time for boredom.<br/><br/>The plot of ""T-3"" is pretty much the same as that of its predecessors. The machines have sent a new and improved terminator, in this case a stunning T-X played by the smokin' Kristanna Loken, back in time from the future to kill someone who will eventually lead the humans in their fight against the machines. Naturally the humans also managed to sneak back their own terminator, albeit an older model, the T-800. This is of course Arnold Schwarzenegger (although not the same robot as in T-2), and he must prevent the T-X from accomplishing her mission.<br/><br/>What separates ""T-3"" from lighter summer fare such as ""Pirates"" or ""The Italian Job"" is the effective philosophy. While not quite up to the high standard of ""T-2"" or ""The Matrix"", it still churns the mind with its issues of fate and time travel. Go ahead, try to completely figure out how a machine from the future can go back in time to affect events that ultimately create the machine itself. Despite the density, every event that takes place makes perfect sense both within the movie and within the trilogy.<br/><br/>
Schwarzenegger is once again at his best, as the simple-minded and stoic T-800. He slides easily back into the character, and even at age 56 is still a perfect physical and vocal fit. Some say that the role doesn't demand much of Arnold, but perhaps he does it so effortlessly that we don't notice. Either way, seeing him back at the top of his acting game is a pleasure, after such mediocre fare as ""Collateral Damage"" and ""The 6th Day"".<br/><br/>
Nick Stahl, no longer ""In the Bedroom"", fits into the part of a twenty-something John Connor with ease. He provides Connor with the proper world-weariness and gives him grounded logic and street smarts that befit someone who has grown up under his unusual circumstances.<br/><br/>
Loken, much like Robert Patrick in the second movie, doesn't get to display much versatility, but her icily gorgeous eyes and facial features combine with appropriate body movements to supply the T-X with a chilly and imposing aura. She's not quite as fearsome as Patrick, perhaps because she's female; but her character's unstoppable nature is enough to compensate for that.<br/><br/>
Claire Danes, in a role that one might not expect to find her, is Kate Brewster. She happens upon Connor at her veterinary clinic, and is properly naive, much like Neo in ""The Matrix"", as she gets sucked into the tidal wave of action and adventure. The rest of the actors, in mostly little-developed parts, are sufficient to round out the cast.<br/><br/>The comedy in ""T-3"" was an unexpected enjoyment. Much of it was derived from Schwarzenegger's machine mind failing to comprehend various aspects of humanity, verbal and otherwise. Arnold's classic monotone delivery is perfect, both in tone and timing. Other comedic sources included a number of references to the prior films. Some are obvious (""She'll be back""); some are less so (the reappearing shrink). But they are all amusing, providing necessary comic relief for a movie that could easily have been overbearing and overly serious. One other amusing theme is the one-upmanship involved in various stunts and chase scenes. Things just keep getting bigger, and I couldn't help but laugh. ""T-3"" wasn't bust-a-gut funny, but it consistently induced chuckling from the audience in a number of ways.<br/><br/>
One of the joys of ""T-3"" is the physicality of the stunt and fight sequences. Because of the virtual immortality of the two terminators, brutal acts of violence are necessary when fighting them, acts that can't be done to normal humans. There's something painfully (sadistically?) enjoyable about watching someone bashing a foe with a just-ripped-off-the-wall urinal, or seeing a truck slam straight into a building. I found myself constantly wincing, but also grinning at the same time. Seeing someone get the crap beat out of them while knowing the characters won't actually be injured is surprisingly, perhaps frighteningly, engrossing. Additionally, those scenes appear to be mostly stuntwork, not CGI. Contrasting the highway chase scene in ""Matrix Reloaded"", which is gloriously sleek and jaw-dropping, the car chase in ""T-3"" is brutal and punishing. In a cinematic time that favors heavy reliance on computer imagery, that honest physicality in stuntwork is extremely refreshing.<br/><br/>This is a movie that should be seen on the big screen, preferably one with a high quality surround sound system. The theater I patronized was unfortunately lacking in the aural department, as the audio was front-heavy. But I still appreciated the sound. Without being overly loud, the sound effects did their job quite well, providing the proper noises at the proper times. The score was not very noticeable, which means that composer Marco Beltrami did his job suitably. Somewhat surprisingly, the recognizable Terminator theme of Brad Fiedel did not surface until the end of the movie (unless I missed it).<br/><br/>The other reason I recommend the theater experience is the bigness of the flick.  Like its prequels, ""T-3"" is simply a large movie. Arnold is big; various vehicles are big; themes are big; everything is done on a grand scale. Plus the picture looks good. With machines as a primary subject, the film is conducive to a slick appearance, and cinematographer Don Burgess (""Cast Away"", ""Bourne Identity"") delivers a gleaming final cut.<br/><br/>
If you haven't seen the first two renditions, you'll definitely miss out on some of the jokes, and won't have a full understanding of everything discussed, but you can still enjoy the film. I recommend seeing the other two first, but it's not entirely necessary. The presence of Kate, also a newbie to the world of terminators, allows John Connor and the T-800 to explain much of the backstory without seeming dry. Taking a cue from the original, most of the exposition wisely occurs on the run, so it doesn't slow the movie down, but rather fills in the blanks of the plot while still moving forward.<br/><br/>Not comparing ""T-3"" to its predecessors is impossible. This one isn't quite as cultish as the first, nor as dark or ground-breaking as the second. However ""T-3"" is still a thoroughly worthy and engaging finale (?) to the series.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: The issue of fate combined with the spectacular action sequences make this an above average flick. Terminator fans should be pleased too. Worth a big screen viewing and surprisingly enjoyable. Three of four stars for now.  Maybe more as it grows on me."

","Remember T2? , Arnie CSM-801 (Cyberdyne Systems Model 801) says to Miles Dyson that no-one must follow his work, so Dyson drops a piece of the ""chip"" on the detonator and the Cyberdyne Systems building blows up. The T-1000, The Terminator and John Connor would have dissappeared before Sarah Connor's eyes and the building she was in would have instantly changed to a shopping mall, carpark anything.(Like in ""Back to the Future 2"" when Marty & Doc leave his girlfriend behind, Marty wants to go pick her up, but Doc says we don't need to as the timeline will change around her.) So Mr Cameron didn't tell us or Miles Dyson that the Hi-Tech chip from the first ""Terminator"" was sent to Miltary Intelligence, when they finished with it they sent it back to Cyberdyne Systems. Cue T2,Young Tech;""Where did it come from?"" Miles Dyson""You know I asked once, know what they said?,Don't ask.""(You could take that comment from Dyson that the ""chip"" and ""Arm"" came from anywhere, let alone from a hydraulic press from inside Cyberdyne.) The ""chips"" the military made would have been stamped CSM because they (CSM) still owned rights to the design and the US miltary do not want a lawsuit over it. So the timeline continues, the T-1000 chases the T-801,Sarah and John into the steel-mill then a delayed Judgment Day, the war against machines will happen, they lose so they try time travel to wipe **SPOILER**<br/><br/><br/><br/>out Sarah Connor, then John, now his Commanders. If they CSM-101, T-1000, T-X succeed the machines will rule the planet, if not the humans will have their freedom back, but in a desolate wasteland 2029A.D.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 is ok, but I missed Brad Fiedel's score during the film. In T2 when John is chased by the T-1000 in that big black tow-truck, you've got a mixture of truck/harley/dirt-bike/shotgun but it's that pumping music that Fiedel does so well it's like musical kinetic energy. If only Fiedel was allowed to score the pick-up truck, crane truck chase it would have raised adrenaline levels as it did in T2.<br/><br/>Weapon Systems; T-801 has to find guns, T-1000 knives and stabbing weapons, T-X has a multi-purpose gun built-into arm. Some comments say that the T-1000 is better than the T-X and that the T-801 is to old, seriously if this were real, it doesn't matter which one is after you, If you get caught its game over. T3 on the whole was a blast to watch and I will go see it again.<br/><br/>

","Bottom line: while not as epically cast as 'Terminator 2' nor as low-budget gritty as the original 'Terminator,' 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' delivers precisely what it set out to do -- create high-budget kinetic fun with characters by now so familiar that dialogue is rarely ever necessary -- which is much much more than one can say about almost every other film this summer. (The exceptions, of course, are 'X2,' 'Finding Nemo' and '28 Days Later.') Der Arnold fits his role like finely-cut body-built hand to black- leather glove, and new-to-the-series director Jonathan Mostow injects a very welcome sense of knowing humor into the proceedings. Meanwhile, somehow Nick Stahl and Claire Danes manage to not only avoid the curse of the young-pretty-talented-actor- cast-in-overwhelming-Hollywood-spectacle, but actually ELEVATE the film with their subtle, emotionally grounded performances.<br/><br/>8/10"

","If you want to see T3, just watch T2 again and then add on five minutes worth of plot mythology development. Basically, T3 seems to exist to make money, instead of make money and take us meaningfully forward in the Terminator franchise. <br/><br/>Let's see ... Terminator sent back in time to kill John Connor (and a few others, given lip service but no meaning)? Check. Other Terminator (older model) sent back to protect Connor? Check. War between humans and self-aware machines coming? Check. Car chases involving big, destructive trucks? Check. Bar scene where naked Terminator gets clothes? Check. Organization that will unwittingly allow self-aware machines to control nuclear weapons? Check.<br/><br/>I mean, what was new? Very little. A minor philosophy change involving fate (Sarah Connor turns out to be wrong after all). A very brief bit of reprogramming that causes a good guy to be a bad guy for a few minutes. Even the fancy new Terminator is very similar to the new one in T2. It has an additional weapons ability and one minor wrinkle where it can control machines, but really, who ever thought a Terminator couldn't do that?<br/><br/>That's just the beginning. This movie raises many questions about its own story. For instance, if it is so easy for the machines and humans to send machines back in time, how can this ever end? Why not send a Terminator back to 1961 and kill Sarah Connor as a child? Or kill her parents back in 1930? The franchise really needs to point out that this process is terribly difficult and limited.<br/><br/>Also, John Connor knows how he will die. So now that he knows, why can't he prevent it? It's not like it is a random bomb. There is a very specific set of actions that must occur for Connor to die, and Connor himself must OK one of them. So why would he ever do it?<br/><br/>T3 is very disappointing, and one of the most crass cash grabs I have ever seen from Hollywood."

","Overall I feel like the movie was worth the price of admission but I was a bit disappointed.  The story was good and it answered all of the questions I had going into the film but where the movie fell short was in Arnold.  His movement, facial expressions, and overall speech pattern strayed from that of the previous two films.  It seemed to me that the attitude he brought to the character had to be forced out where as the other two films it seemed to come natural for him.  At times it seemed as if his movement resembled that of a 70 year old man with a sore back instead of a nearly indestructable cyborg.  Maybe I am being overly critical.  Being a movie fanatic, I tend to expect more than the average movie goer.  I'm sure, however, that I am not alone in complaining about the feeble attempts at comedy (like ""she'll be back"" and the starred/glittered sunglasses).  Moments like that took away from the serious and intense nature that the movie should have displayed. I urge everyone to see this film but I also urge everyone to question how old is too old for an action star and more importantly is it the age of the body or the age in the heart they bring into their work."

Cameron told it all in the first 2 films - there is no conceivable reason to come out with this 90 minute demolition derby and room/building trashing fest, except that Hollywood, as usual, can't let a very good film(s) go, without cheapening their memories by coming out with some inferior ""continuation."" This is like every crappy follow -up Disney has put out on direct-to-video. Arnold looks great, but some of his ""clever"" lines seem desperate. There's no believable chemistry between John Connor and his ""future bride"". Claire Danes is a very good actress, but she seems wasted in what is little more than a ""scream queen"" role. Balitrami's score is lame - he should stick to David Lynch films. All in all, a big disappointment from the director who gave us the excellent U-571 and the even better BREAKDOWN.

","I was wondering at first if this third installment would live up to the class of the original saga without James Cameron. No, an aged Arnold Schwarzenegger was not my subject of concern. It was director Jonathan Mostow. He was good in U-571 but it was to see how he makes up with all the hypes. I was wondering about the story as well. The Terminator saga differs in this point from the other contemporary movie serieses. That it never had a specific storyline. When the Terminator (1984) was made, nobody knew nothing about a sequel. Terminator 3's exact story was not planned while making Terminator 2 (1992). This is probably the reason behind such long gaps between the movies. <br/><br/>But I am quite satisfied with both. Mostow did a nice job. Of course he is no Cameron, but I liked his simple style. This movie had to contain some first-person storytelling by John Connor himself. There was no other way to describe the situation. I felt relieved to see Mostow did exactly that. There were some rather 'comic' sequences and dialogs. I take it as Mostow's credit as well. The casting was quite interesting. Schwarzenegger... well, it's irrelevant if he was good or not at this point. Claire Danes, probably one of the most underrated actresses of recent years, performed very well. Hers was a strong role. And it was perfect casting. Nick Stahl may look geekish in the movie but I found him not that bad as critics are saying. The surprise was Kristanna Loken. The idea of a female terminator was very unique, though not too unexpected. Whether she is decent as an actress the future can tell, but all I can say she fitted into the role very finely. She turned out to be one of the major attractions.<br/><br/>And the story! I feel very happy to write that I enjoyed the story pretty much. It has probably the best story out of the three. Why? simply because it connects the past and the future. In the other three movies you just saw the possibility that Connor's going to lead the war against SkyNet in some future. But this movie showed exactly how it all began. In the shell it may look just like a replay of T2, with a robot from future to kill him and a robot to save him. But T3 is not all about that. It was a bold and revolutionary idea to show the start of the war at last. I don't know any plans about T4 this time, but as far as the things are going it may not feature Arnold at all. <br/><br/>Quite enjoyable; 8/10."

","(SPOILERS inside)<br/><br/>Tagline: If you're a true fan of Terminator & T2 then forget T3 (or whatever!). And if you actually think JP3 is better than JP & JP2 and MIB2 is better than MIB then you better go now to book your seat for T3!!<br/><br/>First of all I'm a fan of Terminator the original and the first sequel. I find T2 is better than the original in many ways (although this is somehow a tough decision to make coz the original was great). T2 got great great action scenes, better story, great special effects by ILM, great acting by Linda Hamilton, cool ideas with a great story all the way, great directing, and great music. Enough? I dunno. I may add that I love it how T2 unfolds the story and all the scenes that make you scream COOL (like young John Corner riding his bike/ Sarah and her sporty acting/ T-800 looking for cloths with that song/etc..).<br/><br/>So I went to T3 wishing to see something equal to that or maybe (just maybe) better. I knew I wouldn't buy anything if it's not James Cameron but I went along with the story anyway. Well, I tried alot to enjoy it but I couldn't. I laughed few times for Arni's lines. I actually started enjoying this movie in the last minute and couldn't understand how can it end like this, and now I hate it more because of this. The ending was very interesting: It's kinda promising ending (for at least another sequel) as hell as possible but you can use it as the true ending of the series. One thing to add is that I totally hated to see how Matrix Reloaded was affected by Minority Report, and now I see T3 getting affected by Matrix. Give me a break!<br/><br/>Let's get to the details: Arnold seems to get better in the Terminator series. He started to look older though. I missed Sarah Corner and I especially missed Linda Hamilton. John Corner got some nice acting but he surely doesn't look like young John (from T2) to me. T-X was cool and it's good acting by Kristanna Loken, but I don't see her that much of sexy as they wanted us to think and as everyone is calling her that. Music? Well all I can say that it's nice, not much. Cinematography? Also nice, but not so great as Minority Report or Matrix Reloaded. Story? We all wanted to know more and more about the future and how everything happened and all, but I don't find T3 necessary to the series. I also hated how it ended, because we can end it just here (i.e. you know the war of the future and all) but it also opens the door if there ever gonna be T4 or more (i.e. we can actually see the war finally). Anything positive? Well yeah, the action scenes. They did a very good job on the action scenes. Cool action, they tried to make it as real as possible, and the special effects were great. If it was up to me, at least I'd shorten the introduction and add more to the story after the ending.<br/><br/>Was this any real review? Nope. I just wrote my opinion."

Oh, and on top of it all, they were kick-ass action flicks to boot.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 should have been a continuation of this. In the absence of the story's creator, those in charge of making the next Terminator film clearly must have acknowledged that they held a certain responsibility to the characters and story that had been told thus far, and they very clearly threw it everything beautiful and important about the Terminator franchise in favour of what they perceived in their narrow, bank-balance-oriented minds to be what 'the Terminator' is all about: Explosions and trucks and one-liners. Like I said, the film plays like a TV spin-off. It looks like one, it's crafted like one, it has the ""Tune in next week, Folks!"" mentality of an obnoxious TV Pilot, and finally it transfers only enough surface-level material from the previous films (the trucks, the explosions, the character's names, Arnie) to bear a passing resemblance to the Terminator films, but only remind you of how great the others were, at least in comparison, and what a cheap, misguided, misinformed, mistreated, disrespectfully and condescendingly poor excuse for a cash-grab this bad one-liner of a joke this film is.<br/><br/>What a shame.

","Once again, it amazes me how a group of movie makers can take an established, solid concept with splendid plot elements, and mould it into a hair ball of cheap, run-of-the-mill entertainment. This third installment continues the story about ten years after T2, and once again John Connor's life is threatened by a killing machine from the future. In other words, you basically get exactly the same movie all over again, only with an altered cast. If anything, it just serves as a cheap build up for a fourth Terminator movie that shows what will eventually happen in the future. No wonder the director is relatively unknown either. Not many people would want to droodle on from James Cameron's modern day sci-fi classic, T2.<br/><br/>
Nick Stahl is a good choice to play a more grown up version of John Connor. The problem lies in the script itself, handing him some awfully dull lines. His speech about the death of his mother for instance, is a painful scene to watch. Flatly written and executed. Claire Danes on the other hand, however cute and sympathetic she might be, is clearly miscast for this role. I don't think she delivered a single one of her lines in a believable manner. She's supposed to go through a whole lot in this movie, transforming her from a scared young girl to a confident action companion for the lead hero. Hearing her yell ""Die, you bitch!"" to the TX at the top of her lunges, with her usual shrill voice, just didn't cut it for me. Neither didn't any of her more quiet moments of grief and guilt when her loved ones are slaughtered seem very natural. As for Kristanna Loken, she does what she can with the premise of the female Termitatrix - and that's that. This movie was never meant to display any of her eventual acting abilities anyway.<br/><br/>
Sure, the third Terminator movie delivers a lot of action, huge explosions and even some wry humor, but is that really all you want from this series? In that case you'd be just as well off watching Bad Boys II. The epic scope of T2 is completely muddled here, as are some earlier vital plot elements ignored. And what's up with the screwball comedy?! To watch Arnie's Terminator don Elton John glasses by mistake, crossing eyes when malfunctioning and getting crabbed by the crouch, just seems totally out of place. It's one of the things that makes T3 seem much brighter and less filled with tension than the previous installments. Almost like A Disney movie with some added gore and violence. Even the short Terminator-3D-movie made for the theme park ride at Universal Studios is more interesting than this mess."

It won't be long before the vultures pull at the carcass and find enough sustenance for a part 4, 5 and beyond... But back to 3.<br/><br/>The Austrian Oak was in dire need of a hit in the early Naughties, and for many, reviving this particular franchise - if two films constitute a franchise that is - smelled of desperation: haven't we mined this story's potential to the core already? And what of creator James Cameron's complete lack of interest? When your main champion prefers to go deep-sea diving than having anything to do with you, you must have done something wrong...<br/><br/>Terminator 3 raised many questions, first of which was: is this even necessary? The truth is: now that it is here, imperfect beast that it is, it is essential. For one, it cleans up narrative issues raised in part two's time travel paradoxes (if you pay attention, Skynet created itself). It also asks interesting questions about choice vs fate, and ends in what is possibly the series most arresting visual moment. It also embraces its throwback nature, not just in accepting its aging star's limitations but in incorporating them to the story, but in its brutal, real action choreography, chiefly a nasty crane-equipped car chase that puts even the computer wizardry of Matrix Reloaded to shame. <br/><br/>At the same time, T3 allows itself to partly spoof the original, a point of contention for many, but a refreshingly sober thing for a sequel to do in this day when follow-ups, for some reason, always have to aim for darker (see Matrix and Pirates of the Caribbean).<br/><br/>Of course, not all is perfect: after Edward Furlong, Nick Stahl is a somewhat uninspiring John Connor, and Claire Danes is given surprisingly little to do. The worst let-down, though there is interesting conceptual work at play there, is the new antagonist, dubbed the Terminatrix by a mocking audience. There is no doubt that after Robert Patrick's glacial T1000, this is a disappointment, and something more chilling, such as a worrying fusing of human and machine, would been not just more interesting, but frighteningly prophetic, a key trait of the saga as a whole. But when Arnold appears on-screen again, a lot is forgotten and more is forgiven.<br/><br/>The first two Terminator films are solid 10s, so by that measure this can't compare, and yet, after the disappointing Hulk and the over-hyped and overindulgent Matrix Reloaded, Terminator 3 may also well be the most entertaining blockbuster you see this Summer.<br/><br/>Nowhere near as good or as clever as its predecessors, but good fun nonetheless."

Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as The Terminator who returns to protect an adult John Conner from an advance model-killing machine called the T-X played by Kristanna Loken. Every thing that was set up before in Terminator 2 is throng out for the sake of another sequel, and the story is not only incoherent but also down right annoying in certain parts of the film.  The T-X is not as advance as the T-1000 from Terminator 2, and not as menacing. You were actually scared of The T-1000, and it gave you a reason to be scared by the way that it could kill at will. The T-X is just poor carbon copy of the T-1000, and not as efficient of a killing machine. The story should have been better and should have been a great continuation of the second movie but in it's journey to be different, it forgot what it should have been.  Sure, it's a great time waster but compared to the others, it's a disappointment.

","After reading some of the both grovelly and negative reviews around the place (I won't refer to which ones or where they might be, but everybody knows what I'm talking about), I thought I'd do a brief one of my own for movie go-ers.<br/><br/>Hopefully, I can even out the positives and the negatives and give you an idea what you are in store to see without giving spoilers.<br/><br/>Firstly, the positives.<br/><br/>
1. This is Johnathan Mostows own piece of art. He does not try to imitate James Camerons style.<br/><br/>2. Many brilliant, detailed action scenes.<br/><br/>3. Clever plot twists.<br/><br/>4. The T-X is was cleverly conceived, a worthy successor to the T-1000. 5. Classic 'Arnold' moments.<br/><br/>6. Good ending, conjuring bittersweet emotions (in a form which sets it apart from the other two films, I might add)<br/><br/>
Now, the negatives.<br/><br/>
1. Poor incidental music. No real themes for each character.<br/><br/>2. Lacking in exposition in characters (especially the nature of the T-850). Also a little lacking in exposition in general (I think) - perhaps a novelisation could fill these gaps.<br/><br/>3. Emotional flow of movie a little off balance (a problem I also noticed in Mostows U-571)<br/><br/>4. Some cross-movie continuity errors (forgivable ones, I might add). Just remember the numbers '10' and '13'.<br/><br/><br/><br/>My overall assessment 7 1/2 out of 10. Certainly worth going to see. Don't go with *too* high expectations, but be rest assured, this is *not* flop material."

","The `Matrix' movies have been all the rage the past several years, yet, in terms of their plotting, they seem to have gleaned many of their core ideas from the earlier `Terminator' films.  When you think about it, the `Terminator' and `Matrix' films share the same basic premise: a race of machines takes over the earth, destroying most of the human population in the process, save for a rebellious remnant whose job it is to keep sending representatives either back in time (as in `Terminator') or into the artificial world of cyber reality (as in `Matrix') to try and undo the damage.  Is it not then a bit redundant to have a new film from both these franchises in the same movie season?  Perhaps it is, but I doubt that hardcore action films will complain.<br/><br/>`Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' picks up where `Terminator 2: Judgment Day' left off.  We meet the famous John Connor, the presumed rebel leader of the future resistance forces, now living a dissolute life in Los Angeles, reasonably convinced that, by averting nuclear war in the last film, he will never have to assume the burdensome role of `savior of humanity'  a role he feels unqualified to fill - that fate might otherwise have decreed for him. But when a sequel is called for, rest assured that nothing is ever quite as simple as it appears and, thus, John once again becomes the target of a killer robot sent back from the future to destroy him.  This time, however, he has a love interest of sorts  Kate Brewster, a veterinarian who finds herself enmeshed in all the havoc, since she too will become a key figure in the post-apocalyptic rebellion.  As in `Terminator 2' (but not `Terminator 1'), Arnold Schwarzenneger plays the `good' robot sent back to protect Connor's life, since Connor is, for some odd reason, apparently the only person on the face of the planet capable of mounting an effective counterforce to the brutal machines.<br/><br/>`Terminator 3' features more solid mayhem than virtually any film in recent memory.  (It is also probably LOUDER than any film ever made, as well). Jonathan Mostow, replacing James Cameron at the directorial helm, has provided action fans with a veritable orgy of car chases, gun battles, and massive explosions, so many of them, in fact, that it's a bit surprising in retrospect to realize that he has also managed to pour a little plot and character development into the mix as well.  `Terminator 3' is like a fix for action movie junkies, one that moves at a breakneck pace and never lets up in intensity.  It's true that one may become a bit dismayed at the cavalier indifference shown towards the innocent victims in the film, but that seems to be par for the course in our increasingly coarsened culture. John (Nick Stahl) and Kate (Clair Danes), in true action-movie fashion, bounce back from a succession of gunfights and body slams with a resilience worthy of the terminator machines themselves.  Are you sure they aren't ALL just robots under the skin?<br/><br/>The whole enterprise might have dissolved into tedious redundancy were it not for the humorous self-awareness demonstrated by Arnold Schwarzenneger, whose straight-faced, deadpan delivery heightens the dry humor of much of the screenplay.  After years of playing this type of character, Arnold seems totally relaxed as he goes for the big laughs, wisely sensing that the best way to approach this material is to gently rib himself and the audience at the same time.  I honestly cannot remember when Arnold has been this good.<br/><br/>Like virtually all time-travel scenarios, `Terminator 3' eventually finds itself caught in a box of mind-bending inconsistencies.  We are told that the machines of the future send terminators back to the past (our present) to prevent John and Kate from surviving the war and becoming the leaders of the resistance movement in the future.  Yet, as the story is constructed here, it is the terminator itself who, by hunting down the desperate pair, actually ends up SENDING them to a place where they will be able to survive the nuclear holocaust that destroys much of the world.  Had the machines just left the two alone, they would most likely have perished with the rest of the hapless human race, clearing the way for the machines' unchallenged domination in the future.  Can these wise machines not see the ironic result of their sending the terminator to try and destroy these two human threats?<br/><br/>Oh well, logic and common sense are not necessarily the primary ingredients of a film of this sort.  Suffice it to say that `Terminator 3' provides enough action and humor to tide us over till the next inevitable installment.  Let's just hope we don't have to wait till Arnold has served out his second term as governor to get to it."
"FlorisV","Null","0","0","23 July 2003"," Not as bas as I expected, but it could have been much better
","This movie has pretty much everything you expect from a Terminator film. Plenty of action and great fx. There were some important things missing though.<br/><br/>First of all, I think the casting could have been better. In the making of Arnold said that they went through 10.000s of auditions and that Kristanna Loken was by far the best. I find that a little hard to believe. She's not really bad but far from flawless in portraying a robot. She shows human emotions all the time, either aggression or an evil grin. T-X is not half as frightening as T-1000, and I think here lies the main problem of the film. She's pretty much your average blonde bimbo except that she is programmed to kill people. T-X does not even come close to Robert Patricks great performance. Kristanna Loken wasn't much more than a supermodel shooting rockets out of her arm. And I don't think that Nick Stahl was believable either, as a supposedly charismatic would-be rebel leader. The only good casting choices were Claire Danes and (obviously)Arnie.<br/><br/>
Besides the casting this Terminator film clearly suffers from not being a James Cameron film. Even though it's better than I expected, it simply lacked the suspense and atmosphere that especially the first Terminator film had. The action scenes were pretty much cloned from T2 (car chases with trucks...hmmm where did we see that before?). Don't get me wrong, Terminator 3 is a very entertaining action film. It's just that the emphasis lies too much on action. The sci-fi elements and suspense/horror elements are pretty much neglected. T-X is not scary for a moment, nor is Skynet's artificial intelligence taking over the world. It would take a better filmmaker (hint: Cameron) to add a darker atmosphere, as well as a good music score (i.e. the original music score, which was abandoned here). What's left is good, enjoyable popcorn entertainment with a couple of new gadgets, nothing more.<br/><br/>As a final note, I think it would be far more interesting to actually see the postapocalyptic war between the machines and humans, of which we've seen interesting glimpses in the Terminator movies. Bring on T4!<br/><br/>7 out of 10."

","Arnold is back as the Terminator, but this time it is not with the same success as the previous.<br/><br/>I liked the first two movies, and I also like the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Anyway, I feel that three people really have created the Terminator universe, and these three people are Arnold, Cameron and not at least the composer Brad Fiedel. The last two were missing in this third movie, so I was very sceptical of this one.<br/><br/>The movie was entertaining though, so maybe I should not complain, but I was not impressed. Kristanna Loken did an acceptable job as TX, but it was not as good as Robert Patrick as T-1000 or Arnold's previous performances.<br/><br/>A thing that I did not like in this movie was that the Terminator was made a bit comical. It was fun to watch some of the scenes with the Terminator where he did some funny things, but it was more like a take-off of the old Terminator. It created a dilemma, I was entertained, but at the same time I was a bit frustrated, that the movie was not serious like the old Terminator-movies by Cameron.<br/><br/>Compared to the old movies this movie is not like them. The movie does not have the ideas of James Cameron and the music of Brad Fiedel, I missed them both. A last thing that I missed was Arnold as the Terminator, I did not feel he was a cyborg/robot, maybe he missed the instructions from James Cameron.<br/><br/>I may sound very disappointed, but that is not quite true. The action was maybe the best ever filmed, and the story was acceptable.

The only exceptions so far are the Die Hard and the Star wars trilogies. I sincerely hope I can add Charlie's Angels 3, Matrix 3 and Blade 3 on my exceptions list in the near future...<br/><br/>But back to T3: the plot is not that bad, but it's so filled with (bad) jokes and plotholes that sometimes you're not sure if this is supposed to be a spoof. At the end we get to some good ol' stuff, like the machines taking over and Arnie vs. the TX, but this is taken away with Arnie fighting with himself- bad idea, bad acting. I strongly believe that the original idea there had Arnie going bad and that the last fight was supposed to be between John vs. bad Arnie, but that this was scrapped because a test audience consisting of 1.000 pot-headed teenagers who had never seen T1 thought it's too dark. Right.<br/><br/>In my opinion the end would have also been better without throughout explanations: the pair gets to the basement, find out it's not skynet, figure out Arnie tricked them there to be safe and the camera pans away as they're listening to the end of the world. Dark like (the original) Planet of the apes.<br/><br/>I don't know what this is, but it sure don't feel like the other terminator movies.

","Contains spoilers Okay, here's another chance where hollywood could have pulled off a great movie but proves once again that a quality sequel is second to a just producing a sequel.<br/><br/>T3 has just been reduced to the status of just another sequel.  James Cameron's T2, like Titanic, Aliens and the Abyss are brilliant in their construction.  Sure there are minor plot questions but nothing major. Character development and the story was as important as the special effects. Cameron poured quality into T2.  It is the quality of a sequel that will stand the test of time.  Like Aliens stands the test of time, but Aliens 3 and 4 do not.<br/><br/>So what are my complaints?  1) the comedy in the film was wrong and out of place, 2) the film didn't make me really care about the story, and 3) the plot sucks.<br/><br/>Here is just a few instances of crappy plot that should have been fixed before shooting began.<br/><br/>1)  How did a guy who looks like a hobo loaded with guns and explosives, a weightlifter clad in leather bikerwear and a normal civilian-looking girl get into the middle of command and control in a high security military installation.   And they can walk around freely.  Even though the girl is the general's daughter, they would never get past the first gate. Somebody would at least question the guy with explosives.<br/><br/>2) I won't give away the movie here but the TX has a list of people it needs to ""terminate"".  #1 on the list would be John Conner, #2 and 3 on the list would be the girl and her General father.  When the TX first arrives here, why does she go looking for the guy working at the fast food place?  Then she she goes to where the girl works at 4 o'clock in the morning.  I thought these things are supposed to be smart.  Somebody on this site already brought up this point, but shouldn't she have went to the girl's apartment at 4am because humans are normally sleeping at that time?  Oh yeah, and for some reason Arnold went to the girls work at 4 am too.  It must be a popular hang out for terminators.<br/><br/>3) The TX somehow knew the John Conner was going to the fallout shelter in the desert.  I won't give away anything here either, but I think this is kinda messed up.  There way no way for the TX to know this.  Especially since Arnold earlier said they needed to hide in Mexico. So... the TX should have assumed that as well.  The terminators are supposed to be smart not all-knowing.<br/><br/>4) The whole Cyber-dyne/Skynet thing that made sense in the second film gets confused in this one.  If you pick up a book and read the first two chapters and the entire story is built around certain facts that are butchered in chapter 3, you are probably going to throw the book right out the window. Maybe I'm just confused on this one but according to T2, without Cyber-dyne, Skynet and the Terminators won't exist.  Cyber-dyne was eradicated in chapter 2.  Why couldn't we have come up with some alternate explanation for a ""Judgement Day"" sequel without ruining this ""book"" in chapter 3.<br/><br/>
There was many more instances but these just flat out bugged me during the film.  Can't someone during pre-production screen these things and say something like, ""hey, this don't make sense"" or ""this story blows""?<br/><br/>This would have been a better film if they would have 3 of the Robert Patrick T-1000's and have them sent back for a man hunt to eliminate a list of people. The TX was kinda cool, but the T-1000 was a better advisary.  To have the one TX running all over the place and mangling the plot with it, was stupid.<br/><br/>More importantly, they also needed to explain WHY does the terminator technology still exists today and WHY skynet still exists and WHY that virus was introduced to the machines of the world. And who created and introduced that virus???  I don't know either and I've seen the film.<br/><br/>I think this all boils down to the director who is the man in charge here. Basically it is because Jonathan Mostow was not a great choice for director. He hasn't done anything amazing yet.  His only real success so far was U-571, and that was not a great movie either.<br/><br/>A director needs to be able to supply us the viewers with more than flashes, kicks, and explosions.  We want value for our money.  We want a story that makes sense.  And we want every chapter (sequel) to fill in more of the pieces of the puzzle for us.  We want to love a movie because it has meaning.  If it has meaning and value we will go see it more than once, even at $8.50.  We will want to own it on DVD.  We will want to own the director's cut with added footage in to give us more of what we already love.  That's what Hollywood needs to understand and then maybe we won't get crap sequels anymore.<br/><br/>Not everything has to be flawless in a movie or its' sequels but we want an offering that does not insult our intelligence like this movie does."

","T3 wasn't an awful movie by any definition of the word, but it wasn't great either. As a stand alone action film it was very good. The action was frenzied and satisfying, and the special effects tremendous. Were it to exist without the compelling lore that T1 and T2 built before it, though, it would be merely average.<br/><br/>The TX (the female terminator) was uninspired and boring, and was never alarmingly dangerous as the previous two villians were. She simply didn't scare you, she never seemed unstoppable - which is what the movies were always about when it came to the bad guy: a relentless killing machine that simply can not be stopped, that will never stop, until you are DEAD! Sorry, she wasn't that great. She didn't even look all that great - pretty average looking for a leading female in today's film. And we all know that she was picked to entice young males.....<br/><br/>One great highlight of the film was the humor. This movie really made me laugh out loud a few times (as it did the entire audience). Arnold was as good as he ever was, and really looked great for an old guy. You can tell that he loved making this movie.<br/><br/>In the end, the plot was as solid as it could be, considering that almost everyone knew what was going to end up happening. The action was killer, as was the special effects. But, it didn't live up to it's mythos. The Terminator is supposed to shock and scare you; the Terminator is suppose to intimidate the audience. The TX did anything but.....<br/><br/>8 out of 10 - I would give it a 7 (maybe even a 6), but I realize that it's just an action flick, and you can't expect the world when it comes to that genre. Besides, it's an Arnold movie, and Arnold is the man!"

","For what my view is worth, I was dubious to say the least about the merits of a T3 but came away impressed with the end product. I for one will happily watch it again.<br/><br/>I'd rate this 8/10 and rank it below T1 and above T2. Will T1 ever be topped for tightness of storyline, a nerve-tearing mixture of excitement and palpable fear, an ever-present sense of foreboding, not to mention conceptual inventiveness? Unlikely.<br/><br/>All I remember T2 for is the introduction of morphing to cinema audiences worldwide, as well as xcellent stunts (equalled in T3). T2 was too long, too reliant on special FX, and suffered from a wandering storyline.<br/><br/>Arnie : more menacing in T3 than T2 - in T2 he was pathetically cast as a kiddie's toy (the ultimate aim being to humanise him and to soften and tone down his ultra violent T1 image). He'll never top his menacing T1 character.<br/><br/>The T-X : more frightening and lethal than the T-1000 in T2. Loken's emotionless facial expressions, ice-cool demeanour and machine-like body motions were A1. Her testing of blood samples for DNA was brilliant. A Terminator with a chasis is more beleivable than one made of 100% liquid metal.<br/><br/>John Connor : Stahl's character is a vast improvement on the weak performance delivered by Furlong in T2.<br/><br/>Kate : movie reviewers in Australia have unfairly criticised Danes. I thought she did the job well. Reminded me very much of Sarah in T1 - innocence utterly destroyed.<br/><br/>Dr. Silbermann : a mind wracked with doubt and regret. Good to see him back.<br/><br/>The ending : the closer it got the more it looked like being a happy one, with John and Kate saving the day. Fortunately we were spared this corny conclusion. Much like T1, the future does indeed look a grim one."

","How would they justify another installment of the Terminator franchise after the ending of the 2nd movie? Not unlike to what they did to reactivate the Alien series, they did come up with something that makes sense in a strange way. The setup remains the same as in JUDGMENT DAY,  with the T-100 out to save John Connor's life. Some of the action sequences even look alike, but I guess with two machines after each other, endless chases and destructions of complex buildings are the only thing you can do. Terminator 3 is a fun movie that'll entertain you through its entire running time, but that you will probably have forgotten the moment you leave the cinema..."
"Comiccritic83","9","0","0","21 July 2003"," The best film I've seen of 2003
","7/21/2003<br/><br/>WARNING!! WARNING!! MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS DISCUSSED HERE! DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET!!<br/><br/>Still with me? Good.<br/><br/>""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is not only my favorite film of the ""Terminator"" trilogy, but it's also the best film I've seen of this year so far!<br/><br/>We all know the ""Terminator"" story: John Connor is the leader of the human resistance in the year 2029, helping people fight against the deadly machines that try to wipe out humanity after they take over on August 29th, 1997. Connor ultimately destroys the machines, but before he does, the machines send robots back in time to kill Connor before he can become humanity's savior. <br/><br/>In the first film, a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent back in time to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) before she gives birth to John (later his date of birth revealed to be the year 1985), but it fails.<br/><br/>""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" took place in 1991, where a 10-year-old John (what? If he's 10, shouldn't it have happened in 1995?) is almost killed by a T-1000 robot (Robert Patrick), but it fails when another Terminator (again, Schwarzenegger, re-programmed to protect John and becomes a father figure to him) helps the Connors apparently stop SkyNet, stops the T-1000 and later lets Sarah help it ""self-terminate.""<br/><br/>The film revolves around 23-year-old John Connor (Nick Stahl), who wanders from place to place and wishes not to be found, for fear that the machines of the future-yet-to-come will try and kill him.<br/><br/>Guess what? He's right.<br/><br/>Judgment Day wasn't stopped. It was only delayed.<br/><br/>The Terminatrix, or T-X (Kristanna Loken), is sent back in time to kill Connor. Since Connor has no connections by an address or phone number, the T-X instead starts to kill his future lieutenants in the war to come one by one. Two of the TX's targets are veterinarian Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) and her father (David Andrews), who has a key role in the activation of SkyNet, the sentient program of the future machines. Kate is particularly important - she shares a past with John, and a future (turns out she becomes his wife, his second in command and the mother of his kids).<br/><br/>Later, the Terminator (again, again played Schwarzenegger) arrives in our time after it is re-programmed by Kate to protect her and John in this time (hope you understood all that). Anyway, the Terminator eventually finds them and tries to save them from the T-X, but it also must be careful around the new, deadlier T-X, who can destroy and control other machines as well.<br/><br/>The fight scenes and visual effects are nicely done, and cast itself does a good job with their roles. Schwarzenegger, Danes and Stahl give great performances, especially since Danes goes through the most in the film - she loses her father and fiancée, Scott (Mark Famiglietti), to the T-X and does a nice job in the scenes where she's with John. She even takes out a machine with a machine gun while trying to stop the machines (to which John admits, ""You remind me of my mother."")<br/><br/>Even Loken makes the T-X out to be a worthy foe of the Terminator (though she lacks the creepiness factor of Patrick's T-1000 from ""T2"").<br/><br/>What I especially liked was the lack of gore than what the first two films had (though it has its gross-factor moments, like when the T-X punches her hand through a cop's chest), and the humor. For example: the Terminator arrives in our time naked and arrives at a strip club on ladies' night. He tells a male stripper in a leather jacket outfit to ""take off his clothes"" so he can wear them. When the stripper says, ""Talk to the hand,"" the Terminator grabs his wrist, nearly breaking it in his grip as he does, and puts the hand to his lips as he says, ""Now.""<br/><br/>There's even a nice cameo by Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman, and the plot twists are a nice touch (the Terminator Kate sent back to protect her and John in this film reveals the future Kate does so only after it kills John in the future).<br/><br/>But nothing beats the shocking twist ending, when John and Kate learn the grim truth about SkyNet.<br/><br/>Anyway, there one, confusing flaw that keeps this film from being perfect. John is 23 in this film, and as mentioned before, he was even born in 1985 and was 13 when he last met the Terminator in ""T2"". The film also says Hamilton's Sarah Connor was diagnosed with leukemia after the events of ""T2"", given six months to live but she fought it for 3 years to make sure that on August 29th, 1997, Judgment Day (the day the machines took over) never happened (add to the fact that if ""T2"" WAS set in 1995, that Sarah would've died in 1998 or so, over a year after Judgment Day's date, and you have more confusion).<br/><br/>The time-line doesn't make sense. Had it been done correctly, John would've been about 7 in 1992, 13 in 1998 (one year after the original date Judgment Day would have occurred on) and 19 in 2003. It's best to forget the timeline, and if you're new to the ""Terminator"" movies, then this gripe may not bother you so much.<br/><br/>Still, despite the fact that I found other films this summer to be either EXTREMELY disappointing (""Hulk"" and ""X2"") or just down-right awful (""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean""), ""T3"" was a welcome surprise for me.<br/><br/>I yearn to see a ""T4"", in the hopes that Arnold's famous quote of ""I'll be back"" lives up to its promise."

I like Nick Stahl and Claire Danes together.  I hope the story line is continued even if Arnold is getting too long in the tooth for this stuff."
"dfranzen70","7","0","0","21 July 2003"," Somewhere in the middle of YES! and yeah.
","Smack dab in the middle of such lustrous movies as Pirates of the Carribbean, The Hulk, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Matrix: Reloaded, and X2 comes Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. You know, I remember when Arnold was mighty enough to warrant a Fourth of July opening for his movies, but apparently his studio is happy with the movie's being buried in a sea of zap!bam!pow! action movies.<br/><br/>Ah, but enough carping about the timing. Let's get to the nitty gritty, shall we?<br/><br/>People fall into three categories. First, there are the ones who have never seen a Terminator film. Those people aren't likely to watch this third installment. Then there are the ones who thought the second one was better than the first. Those people will probably think this one's not as good as the second, but about on par with the first. And then thee are those who thought the first one rocked like a mighty cradle; those people might be disappointed and will probably crow to the rest of us that sequels are always bad and that the original is always better.<br/><br/>Here's the story, kids. The scene is a few years after Terminator 2. In that movie, John Connor was 11 years old. Now he's more like 14 or 15. He's on his own, pretty much bumming around the country, doing odd jobs, always on the run, that sort of thing. And somehow he runs into the Terminator along the way.<br/><br/>Now, you might remember the Terminator as being Bad in the first movie and Good in the second. When John meets him, he doesn't know which attitude will be taken by the robot. So why is the T-800 (Arnold) back? Well, he said he'd be. But more importantly, he's here to protect John once again. And from whom, you might ask? From a T-X, a female Terminator, sent back in time by the machines in the future to kill John's lieutenants.<br/><br/>See, the machines don't know where John is in this present time. They do have a fix on the whereabouts of the people who will become his top deputies when he finally leads the resistance. Their theory, then, is to kill them off, hoping to thwart the rebellion by man before it really develops.<br/><br/>Funny thing, though. The homeless John breaks into a veterinary clinic to get some medicine, and it just so happens that working at the clinic is Kate Brewster, who is to be one of his lieutentants. The T-X arrives there to rub Kate out and stumbles upon John, and that's when Arnold shows up.<br/><br/>The second Terminator movie had a huge budget, and the money was wisely spent on special effects, effects that were state-of-the-art in 1991. Now, CGI is all the rage, so the effects aren't so special. So to make up for a lack of innovation, the filmmakers (not James Cameron, who made the first two movies) throw in a lot of crashes, explosions and other loudnesses. In fact, there's a long, long car/truck chase scene near the very beginning that's pretty well done - but overlong. And, unfortunately, it occurs before the plot can really be set in place.<br/><br/>The movie itself isn't very long - two hours is nothing for an action movie. A little more plot padding would have made me feel better about it.<br/><br/>But back to the movie as a whole. Nick Stahl plays John now (it was Edward Furlong in the second, in his debut), and he does a great job. He looks a lot like Ed Furlong probably looks now. Kate Brewster is played by Claire Danes. Yes, Claire Danes! A bit of an unusual role for her, but she can do plucky and empathetic. And of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the T-800, the original Terminator. There's one cameo by a character who had a big role in the second Terminator movie, and it's a funny one, too.<br/><br/>Will you enjoy this movie? I think you will, but it's not going to blow you away like the first or second may have. Arnold carries this movie for the most part, because he doesn't have Linda Hamilton from the other films (as John's mother, Sarah) to help him out. Hamilton was a big reason that T2 was so successful - her role made it more than a Guys Smash Stuff movie. This one doesn't quite escape that fate, however."

It was not the massive let down I expected, and not the showstealing title T2: Judgment Day so rightfully earned, yet still left me ecstatic to see Arnie in his premier role again.<br/><br/>Ok, ok, the movie isn't going to win any Oscars, but from all the recent sequels I have viewed (Including Matrix Reloaded), this was the one film that made me mark out for the fantastic way it was directed. John Moscow, well done. Everything looked fantastic. Arnie, the TX (damn! i'm in love), John Connor, even Cathy Brewster, everything looked and felt amazing. OK, at times the plot had one or two holes (although most of our questions were answered at one point or another during the movie), but I was there for the action that became synonomous with the T series. The new Terminator attitude was a welcome change, especially in the comedy responses. I can picture it now, the moment Arnie puts those 'star' glasses on. who needs Jim Carrey or Chris Rock anyways??"
"Mentat327","Null","0","0","19 July 2003"," Arnold's back.... again.
","Arnold's Terminator comes back in time again to thwart Skynet's attempts to change the future... again. The first sequel, T2, had great special effects, but unfortunately that was all it had going for it. The premise was good, but the story execution was poor, the acting substandard, and was plagued by an annoying John Connor character who had you wishing he'd get killed even before the movie ended.<br/><br/>This third installment has great special effects and I think they even improved on some things. 1. It would have been better if they could have come up with something different in the story and still make it good, but that's pretty hard to do. So it seems like this time they didn't take themselves too seriously, and even poked fun at themselves in some ways. They rehash some of the previous movies one-liners, some with a twist (""She'll be bhack!""), and throw out some new ones. But they kept in check and didn't let it get lampoonish. 2. The totally liquid metal terminator of T2 made for some great special effects, but being totally liquid metal was stupid. Not taking into account the improbable physics involved, you had the feeling that if Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn't the hero, his butt would have been stomped way in the beginning of T2. This time, the evil terminator has a solid skeleton frame with a liquid metal skin, and that's a lot easier for the viewer to swallow. 3. The action is tremendous! And I think that's what they tried to spend most of their focus on, instead of getting to bogged down in a dramatic story that they had no hope of making work, as happened in T2. True, they had to do the obligatory dramatic scenes as the characters get to know each other and try to deal with their situation, but without too much time being spent on it. I think it was a wise choice.<br/><br/>The only really dumb part of the movie (and it was really stupid)was when the evil terminator supposedly infects several motor vehicles with a virus, enabling her to remote control them. I don't think you even have to be an auto mechanic to know just how impossible that is. It looked cool, but it was still massively stupid.<br/><br/>I won't give away the ending, (you can read other reviews for that)but it had a nice plot twist in the end. It didn't have that trademark James Cameron touch of making you think just when the movie is over, there's a finale waiting around the corner. The story could have been better, but I think the director did a pretty good job with what he had to work with. In the end, I was entertained."

","First of all, I didn't look at my watch during the movie, so it couldn't have been a bad movie. I actually quite enjoyed the movie. If I really like it? Quite frankly, I don't know yet. It certainly is a very different movie that T2 was, but so was T2 compared to T1. All in all, it was an action packed movie but somehow I missed a real flow. It seems we were just taken from one scene to another, with bits and pieces missing between them. T3 was not as well edited as T2 was but then again, some of the scenes cut from T2 were quite important for the flow of the movie as well.<br/><br/>
A few things quite annoyed me in T3. For example the car chase. Sure action movies and logic are not really very compatible but I just can't understand, how such an advanced machine as the T-X with it's high level AI, could chase John Connor in a huge crane, with the cranes arm wreaking havoc all over the place? I mean the choice of vehicle was quite good as it is tough and everything but the crane knocking down walls and pulling up cars would slow the vehicle somewhat down. It just doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>
What I did like, was some of the references to the past, like when John Connor said, that he had to train the T-101 all over again or Dr. Silverman's short appearence and his reaction to Arnie.<br/><br/>All in all, T3 was certainly worth the ticket and it will undoubtedly end up in my DVD collection but I'm not really sure yet, where it will rank in the three Terminator movies so far."

Maybe T3 isn't that heavy into all the sci-fi techno-babble, or all caught up in some deep philosophies - but that's ok with me - they can save that for the Critics' beloved Oscar-worthy movies.  What you get is a straight-forward fight-for-survival action movie on a grand scale. At 56, Ah-nuld still kicks almost everyone's ass, John Mostow(sp?) did a fine job of keeping up the pace while injecting a good level of humor at the right times, and everyone else seemed to give it their all.

","WARNING! This may contain spoilers! Read at your own risk<br/><br/>Since when did John Connor become such a wimp, crying, despairing and self-doubting? For those who've watched NGE, you could say he's suffering from Shinji Ikari Syndrome, though to a much lesser extent.<br/><br/>
In T2, when the T-1000 hacks into the police computer database, he looks up John Connor. The date of birth says February 2nd 1985. And Schwarzenegger's Terminator says that 35 years in the future, John reprograms him. In a later scene, John says he is about 45 when that happens, making him 10 years old in T2. Yet in T3, John's voiceover at the beginning of the movie says that the T-1000 struck at him when he was 13. Since John was born in 1985, if T2 was set when he was 13, then the year must be 1998 (1985+1398), one year after Judgement Day occurs, although in T2, Judgement Day has not happened yet as they are so trying to prevent it.  That makes John 10 and not 13!<br/><br/>
There are Arnie's one liners which is the movie's grace. But `unable to comply,' `irrelevant', `subroutines', all sounds very Star Trek-ish. But the age-old line `come with me if you want to live' isn't in the movie, which was disappointing. Another disappointment was how fast the movie was, all the T-X trying to kill John and Kathryn happened in the space of one day.<br/><br/>
I also didn't like the ending with the beginning of the end of the world. It leaves it so incomplete, especially with John's looming and inevitable death by Schwarzenegger's Terminator playing on his boyhood feelings. Hopefully there will be a T4 with a much happier ending. But the introduction of Kathryn Brewster, and all the Lieutenant killing plots show that the franchise is all going downhill.<br/><br/>I wish, however, that I could pass this on to the writers of T3 but I don't know how, if anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated. They should get the ages right, at least in my opinion."

","I knew this film would be hard to follow in the footsteps of 2 prior outings, but I had hopes that it could re-kindle the awe I had as a child when seeing T2. This film had nothing worthy of it. The acting was rather bland and uninspiring, the dialogue lacked punch and the hunour was quite corny (even though I laughed a few times). This film lacks the drive and dark edge of the prior two films. In fact it didn't seem to add or build up to anything significant at all. It seemed like a re-work on T2. To excuse the plot holes and actors that did not reprise their roles we were given new information, which changes the way you view T2 from now on.<br/><br/>The inability to connect with the characters makes it less appealing aswell. They were too jokey with one another which lowered the suspense of the dramatic moments.

Yes True Lies was a box office hit but critically the response was very mixed, although fairly good in Britain. This is also his best since True Lies, it has more in the way of story but the action doesn't quite come up to Jim Cameron standard (little does!).<br/><br/>
Before going on about the strengths of this film I'll comment on the weaknesses. The film has a lot to live up to, and in the end fails to live up to the first two films, while it is still a worthy sequel. Some of the significant weaknesses are the fact that the story is not as interesting or clever, it doesn't have as much character development, although in John's case it does however the other roles are weaker than Sarah Conner and previously Kyle Reese. There is only one prominent 3 dimensional role. As I say Claire Dane's role as Kate Brewster is underwritten and subsequently she is wasted, for instance her fiance is killed by the TX and it has little effect on her, it is not touched upon and is forgotten within five minutes, then the developing relationship between her and John gives her an air of coldness. The thrills lack the excitement and punch of the first two, which is not to say they aren't exciting, but hey its up against Jim. The final action scene is the weakest of all three films and is semi rehashed from the first film. The main problem is that the humour of the film is not as subtle as number 1 or two. It seems that as the franchise has moved along the humour has increased, but here it is bordering on spoof.<br/><br/>
Another key problem is that Arnie no longer is the head of the movie, he doesn't command the screen like he used to, and his role seems to be that of the Terminator doing an impression of the Terminator, funny as it is to see him send himself up slightly, the humour is far to overt and corny. There doesn't seem to be a need for Arnies character in this one (in terms of the way it is written rather than his overall impact in the story, he still has to save them but aside from that his presence is solely about laughs), the TX is a great adversary and once again Arnie plays protector but his role still wasn't 100% pivotal. T1 and T2 with no Arnold and they would be half of what they are, he held the movies together, his role is written with so much comedy involved that he seems like a caricature, it thankfully doesn't affect his dramatic moments too much though. Some other problems are the disappointing impact of Arnies change from good to bad, this could have been much more exciting, in the end it is very brief and lacks punch. Also the future war scenes that gathered much fan interest before the films release are very small and no more than the first two films, I would liked to have seen more because the idea excited me, that is not too big a problem though as it is bound to happen in the next instalment. To round it off into one sentence, it doesn't feel like the Terminator films that Jim Cameron weaned us on! Also Beltrami's score isn't as memorable as the synthy resonance of Brad Fiedels scores. The score seemed fairly cliched and not as inspirational as some of Marcos other work.<br/><br/>Okay my disappointments out the way, and I was a little disappointed at the film considering the early reviews suggested it was going to be very, very good, I found much to enjoy. John Connors role is good and Nick Stahl plays it well, in fact he holds the movie, and this is vital considering the minimal scripting of the other characters, mind you the major focus on him is warranted of course. The action is good, a little over hyped maybe, such as the supposed 15 minute car chase that must have been 5 at most. Even though the film doesn't seem like a 200 million budget there is still plenty of bang for your buck. The TX rocks. Kristanna Loken looks amazing and she looks like a bad ass bitch, she has made a great movement of her own for the TX. She overdoes it at times but she really steals the movie and steals Arnies thunder. The script is pretty good, especially compared to most actioners, it does suffer from some bad dialogue but even the classic first two films had its moments, what action film doesn't? Of course one of the main things was that it was great to see Arnie back in a big action movie kicking some ass, delivering zingers (that were very Commando, very True Lies, a bit too hokey for the Terminators, but still funny) and handling large weaponry, who else but Arnold could walk out with a coffin full of weapons on one shoulder and a large calibre weapon in the other hand and single handedly  wipe out a squad of police vehicles. With a 150 (at least) plus gross under his belt he now will have better options open to him rather than pap like Collateral Damage. There are smiles on the faces of Ah-nuld fans once more with his first truly decent film in nearly ten years (I don't care what critics say True Lies was the dogs bollocks in terms of mindless fun). T3 will be a worthy edition to any action fans DVD collection, and despite Mostow perhaps overstretching himself, going from a 40 million to a 200 million budget production, he is still looking like a top new director coming through, although as its only his third big film in 6 years he needs to accelerate the releases. Most definitely a worthwhile sequel but it falls far short of the first two. Bring on number 4 baby. ***1/2"

","I was expecting to be disappointed as so many sequels do. I was wrong. But, please do bring your best ration of disbelief suspension. I really enjoyed this offering. This was creative and loaded with lots of great, well staged action and developed things along the path the 1st 2 set but better. The plot here had more flesh and it set up an easy run at future franchises. The new Terminatrix is awesome, although I could have stood to see a lot more of her sans the dull brown suit. Her best outfit was the one in her opening scene and she carried it with no small amount of dignity. Arnold was his usual self but with even more class. He did a wonderful job here as the original T almost developing an emotion. The real treat was Claire Danes. What a talent she is. I even like to watch her with her clothes on, a different twist for action films where the females' only usual talent is the cloth hitting the floor. She added a lot to this and I do hope to see her in the NEXT sequel. She could even make it. Of course she is well known as a real actiing talent and she doesn't insult her hosts here, giving a real and poignant effort. I was surprised to see her billed inthis sort of film to be honest. I genuinely began to like her character thanks to her talent."
"rosscinema","7","0","0","20 July 2003"," He's back!
","While not exactly up to the excellence of the first two films I do think this is a worthy sequel to this franchise. Story has John Conner (Nick Stahl) now in his 20's who is basically a drifter and he is still haunted by the events that took place a decade ago. One night in Beverly Hills a new terminator appears (Kristanna Loken) and it takes on the appearance of a beautiful woman and its mission is of course to find Conner. Conner is hiding out at a veterinarians office and early one morning Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) who works there comes to work and finds John. Turns out the two of them went to high school together and suddenly the terminator T-X shows up. Meanwhile, in the desert the older model of terminator appears (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his mission is to make sure John and Kate survive Judgement Day because their children will become important in the future. The old terminator saves them both and there is a very destructive car chase that involves police cars, fire trucks and a big crane. They go to a funeral home in the desert and find the coffin of Sarah Conner which is full of weapons. Kate's father is an Air Force officer named Robert Brewster (David Andrews) and he is in charge of a top secret program that involves this countries weapons system. Its the key to Judgement Day and the three of them race to his installation and try and stop the impending destruction. This film was directed by Jonathan Mostow who demonstrated in ""U-571"" that he could handle a difficult assignment like this. Its not quite up to the first two films and one reason would be the special effects. T2 gave us effects that would change the way films would look. This one does not, but its not that these effects are bad. Their not! But at the same time they're not ground breaking. And Loken as the terminatrix just doesn't come across as we would expect. She is so beautiful and I found it symbolic that she entered our time by emerging out of a Beverly Hills shop window! Its symbolic because she has the look of a mannequin. T2 didn't make Robert Patrick a huge star and I doubt that this will for Loken either. But this still is a very exciting and entertaining film. One thing that this film did was to make sure Schwarzenegger act like a cyborg and not show human emotions. T2 had one glaring flaw in it that still makes me angry to this day. Its at the end of the film where he tells Edward Furlong ""I'm sorry"". Sorry? He's a cyborg! He doesn't feel emotions. And in this film that mistake does not happen, thank god. I was so relieved by that. The film sets up itself for another sequel and it does so with a dark ending that was more in line with the first film. It didn't come across to me as a silly and contrived ending that was only put in for money purposes. I think a continuation is essential and the ending is believable as far as this story is concerned. Arnold has his trademark ""One liners"" throughout the film and in one humorous scene actor Earl Boen reprises his role as Dr. Peter Silberman and along with Schwarzenegger he is the only actor to appear in all three films. The first Terminator was a brutally dark and brilliant film and the second was a very interesting story with ground breaking special effects. This film is not up to those two but it is a worthy sequel that is never boring for one second. On a simple level, its just plain fun to watch Schwarzenegger in these films. One of the most indelible characters in movie history. Lets see T4!"
"ptwomey","Null","0","0","20 July 2003"," The Entertainer
","Jonathan Mostow takes over from James Cameron to release a third instalment of the post-apocalyptic man vs. machine action thriller series The Terminator'. The connection between the original films is very loose and the plot holes come thick and fast, but that doesn't get in the way of a non-stop thrill ride of chills, spills and kills<br/><br/>	The script is nothing short of a carbon copy of film two with a little more emphasis on the action set pieces and a coating of flashback and one-line humour. This time around however Judgement Day has come and gone with no apocalypse, leaving poor John Conner (Nick Stahl) to come to grips with a life without what he has been prepared for. It is not long however before we quickly learn the machines are still out there and still very keen on killing John Conner. It seems Judgement Day was merely postponed by the events of the second film and the catch line `no fate but what we make' was really not that important because it is all going to happen anyway!<br/><br/>	In this adventure the machines send back a Terminatrix or T-X, a female and very sexy Terminator. Unlike those before her this one seems specifically designed to please the human eye, obviously to lure sex deprived males into a false sense of security. None the less she is outstanding and despite having very little to do Kristanna Loken pulls off the seductive killing machine with a sense of freakish sadism and clinical emotional-less efficiency, ah if only all women. *cough<br/><br/>	Needless to say the resistance was able to send back another T-101 or another Arnold Schwarzenegger to protect John Conner. Refreshingly there is a new and interesting twist to this journey in the time-line of the series making the sense of repetition (repeat of film two) go unnoticed at least during the course of the film. Arnold also spends the majority of his time poking fun at his character from the previous films and reprising such lines and `I'll be back' with `I'm back'.<br/><br/>	Jumping right to the point this film is an action film, with very little time to take in the events of the first few minutes of the film the audience is rushed into the films most astounding sequence. John and his new found friend Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) find themselves being chased by four remotely controlled vehicles and a massive mobile crane driven by the T-X herself. The sequence lasts of around 15 minutes and is worth the price of admission alone as we are treated to some very daring and exciting stunts of explosions. <br/><br/>	From here the pace never lets up as Mostow spreads out the thin serving of plot, which on the surface is very interesting but fails to live up to any deep scrutiny. One imagines James Cameron would of put more emphasis on the plot and fleshed it out a great deal more than Mostow. It seems however the emphasis on this film is action and comedy. Unfortunately for Mostow as the film progesses and the hard decisions must be made about the direction the film will take, plausibility and suspense seem to go out the window in place of pure blood-thirsty action.<br/><br/>	Besides all this there is little more to say, the acting ability of Nick Stahl is quite adequate for the role and is Claire Danes who looks convincing as an action star. Arnold returns to what he does best and does it with flying colours, and Kristanna Loken thrusts herself onto the big screen and ultimately steels the show. <br/><br/>	Technically the film is not as sharp as it could be and the special effects are often very noticeable. This is probably an indication of the ability of Mostow who looks promising but does not quite have the finishing touches yet. Oh and the music or soundtrack is utterly woeful and completely the opposite of atmospheric. <br/><br/>	This finally leaves us with a little over two hours of some very entertaining and fun reels of celluloid. Certainly no thinking required, but well worth seeing it on the big screen if you love the traditional Saturday night action spectacular! (7/10)"

","Despite what most people say about Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, that it is too dependent on special effects, it is still a good film. Of course the acting is not of Oscar quality, but the film is of a sci-fi genre and nobody expects it. While T3 has many special effects, it does have an excellent storyline and plot, especially considering Cyberdyne was destroyed in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This film adds an element that was in the original Terminator but not in the sequel: the relationship between two characters, John Connor and Kate Brewster, much like that between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. This adds an extra dimension to a film which would be without much emotions. Overall, it is a film worth watching. For Terminator fans, this completes the trilogy with Judgment Day."

","I have always been a fan of the Terminator movies, and when I first heard they were doing a third, I couldn't help but be disappointed. Strike One. Then the news hit me that James Cameron opted out on this movie. Strike Two. Then I actually saw the movie. Strike three, Hollywood sucks!<br/><br/>First, there is almost no resemblance between T3 and its predecessors, plot wise. Here there is enough plot to satisfy your typical big-budget summer movie. Yet there were enough continuity and plot holes that I felt empty myself. I've had bowel movements more satisfying than the plot of this movie, which absolutely destroys the beauty of ""There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."" But for the masses, this is the movie of the summer. It's all action and forced humor. The entrance of Arnold was not entertaining, nor was him using ""Talk to the hand."" Ick...<br/><br/>Acting...well, it wasn't as bad as ""Battlefield Earth"" but it wasn't good either. Kristianna Loken is a pretty face, and she is nowhere near as frightening and creepy as Robert Patrick. But he also had a score that made him creepy. Arnold is back to what he did well once, but that is no longer there. Here, he tries to channel the Arnold of T2, and fails. Nick Stahl wasn't a bad choice, and continuity wise, I'm glad they chose him instead of Edward Furlong. Furlong just doesn't have the charisma or brooding sense that Nick Stahl brought to John Connor's role. Claire Danes, forgettable, just like the minor characters that pop up here and there.<br/><br/>
The humor...wasn't funny. Trying to make Arnold into a comedian is nearly as bad as making Gimli a comedian. It doesn't fit, it isn't funny, and most of all, it made me want to vomit. <br/><br/>The action is where this movie shines, and that's it. The car chase is phenominal. The fights between the TX and the T800, uh, T101...??? (it was T-800, Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 in the previous films) are very cool. All in all, the action makes this movie. <br/><br/>For being an all-round disappointment for me, it was entertaining. But now my dwindling faith in Hollywood has vanished. No more lacklustre sequels with no plot and all action. 6.5 out of 10"

","I had heard great reviews about this movie, I wasn't terribly sure whether they should have made a 3rd installment to the already successful ""Terminator"" movies. After watching this film, this is the opinion that I have: this movie doesn't even compare to the brilliance that was the first two movies. Despite Nick Stahl and Claire Danes doing a great job as John Connor and Kate Brewster, I thought their storyline way way too soft. Arnold Schwarzenegger was good in his role as the T-800, however he looked as if he didn't have the same interest in playing the role. This T-800 lacked the character that he had in the previous movies despite the notion that he's coming back as different models. I thought that Kristanna Loken was weak as the TX-Terminatrix, not even close to being as sinister as Arnie was in the first movie and Robert Patrick as the T-1000 in the second movie. It's plainly obvious that she was chosen for the role to entice males into watching this movie and also maybe to show that women are strong etc. I'm a woman and I wasn't impressed by her at all, a man should have played the villain or better yet Robert Patrick as a stronger terminator model.<br/><br/>Don't expect anything like the first two installments, the only thing that stuck to true terminator style was the truck scene. Other than that you wouldn't even think you were watching a ""Terminator"" film.<br/><br/>Truly disappointing...."

The special effects in general were well crafted, hammering the senses all the way. <br/><br/>Arnie was at his quipping best and looked in superb shape for his age. Nich Stahl was great as John Connor considering the legacy preceding him and one can only hope that there will be a fourth movie to cement his ownership of the character. Claire Danes was equally as good in her role, giving a good mix of vulnerability and survival desperation. Kristanna Loken as T-X gave a brilliant menacing performance - I don't think I'll look at a blonde haired, blue eyed babe in the same way ever again. I hope her character can be resurrected in a fourth film.<br/><br/>The storyline was crisp and flowing, with only a few minor flat spots and the revelation at the very end will surprise most.

","Appropriately, many large trucks haul the terminators and co through this movie.  I say 'appropriately', because this movie contains an inordinate amount of holes which such vehicles could drive through.<br/><br/>Clearly, Cameron had sewn his movie shut with no intention of a sequel.  We all remember him saying 'T3 without me!' some years back.  Like Alien3, the allure of $$ drove the writers to open up what the creator wanted shut. Most people couldn't care less about this sort of thing, but to me it makes it hard for me to suspend my disbelief.<br/><br/>T3 lacks continuity from the characters of its predecessors.  This John Connor to me just doesn't fit - he's wimpy, seems to have forgotten what he did in T2, and doesn't have the hard edge he had in T2.  The absence of Linda Hamilton, or perhaps any strong human character, diminishes the entire human/robot dynamic.<br/><br/>And while the humor in prior T* movies stemmed from plausible situations that a terminator would run into, you can see right through each of the staged jokes in T3.  You find yourself laughing, but it feels like 'Airplane' humor.<br/><br/>But in spite of all this, T3 certainly gave me a couple hours of entertainment.  I can't get enough of robots destroying things, quite honestly.  Yes, as an engineer I cringe each time I see how easily the movie sidesteps such issues as the weight of a Terminator, the need for amazing amounts of friction between their feet and the ground, and how a clearly visible metallic backpack buckle somehow ignores magnetic forces.<br/><br/>So, while I clearly enjoyed the entertaining action and eyecandy, I missed the depth of the T* films which transcended a cheap action movie."

What upset me most was that Arnold's acting was too human and less android-like. Why? It seemed they sent a terminator with more prior interaction than ever before.

"randomStuff101","6","0","0","18 July 2003"," Not bad, but nothing compared with T1 and T2
","Firstly I'll say that it's always fun to watch the Terminator, even if the movie around him isn't that great. His one-liners and antics are very funny, but he still seems just as tough in T3 - maybe more so than T2, and also wiser. He admits to having ""sub-routines in basic psychology"", and the results are humorous and a nice touch.<br/><br/>Of course he isn't as dark and evil as in T1, but who could expect that anymore. He apparently still isn't ""allowed"" to kill cops or people - I suspect censorship, or typical Hollywood efforts at pleasing a wider audience is to blame for that. Doesn't matter. <br/><br/>The story was interesting and used the familiar Skynet theme well. The way it all unfolded though is something worth criticising. Perhaps it was because an inexperienced Director was at the wheel, but it was all so one-tracked, lacking the substance, suspense, cinematography and skillful storytelling of T1 and T2. It would be tough to live up to T1 and T2, but that's what the filmmakers are paid the big bucks for right?<br/><br/>
There were too many references to T1 and T2. I was hoping for more original and new ideas with things like the Terminator looking for clothes, stealing cars, and various other things. I felt a lot of the scenes were merely re-hashed ideas...a Hollywood cash-in maybe, on proven concepts.<br/><br/>Unlike T1 and T2, T3 failed to be a good film when there wasn't action scenes going on. The effect this has is that you don't connect with the characters as much, because they aren't put in any decent non-action situations. Is the problem with editing? Story? Screenplay? I don't know, but what I do know is that T2 was an excellent film in ALL respects, but T3 was only good some of the time. I wish this wasn't so, but it's true.<br/><br/>
Where is the creative filmmaking in T3? The answer is that, apart from some effects, funny lines, and a couple of action scenes, there was no creativity.<br/><br/>T4 should be interesting though, can't wait! <br/><br/>6 / 10"

","I entered the movie theater prepared for the worst.  How could I not be? I had seen both previous Terminator movies, and if the steep drop-off between the smart and decidedly unnerving original and the dull overblown action sequence of a sequel was any indication of how the new film promised to be, then I expected nothing short of what I actually saw- nearly 2 hours of absolutely gratuitous mayhem.  Script, acting, plot holes, logic- all of these took a backseat (or were stowed away in the trunk) to what was more or less one very long action scene after another.  That isn't to say the action scenes aren't worth watching.  In fact, they're so good that about a half hour into the movie I forgot that normally necessary film elements like meaningful dialogue or characterization were entirely lacking, and managed to thoroughly enjoy the whole experience.  Any one expecting, or at the very least hoping for (as at least one viewer was) the darkness or profundity of the original, please look elsewhere.  But if you want to see special effects that aren't glossed with the polished sheen of a video game (Matrix 2), and like sitting on the edge of your seat for two hours, then buy tickets for this movie.  Unlike Ang Lee, who attempted (unsuccessfully, I think) to create a blockbuster/art piece, the director of Terminator 3 made a blockbuster that doesn't try to be anything more than a jaw-dropping, heart-palpatating, wholly mind numbing chase/kill/hide/kill-some-more type film.  Bottom line: Expect nothing from this film, and you'll have a wonderful time."

","James Cameron is a GREAT director of action sequences. In T2, the action sequences were VERY meticulously done. For example, when John Connor (Edward Furlong) flees to the LA flood channels on a motorcycle to escape the T1000, James Cameron focuses his Camera on the obviously exhausted and perplexed John Connor, who FEELS he is safe, but James Cameron then performs his magic and let's the audience HEAR the semi truck squealing its wheels and then BAM!, BOTH the audience and John Connor are shocked to see the truck leaping off the bridge at a close proximity to John Connor. In effect, James Cameron creates DRAMA in his action sequences which makes the audience ENJOY the action despite its foregone conclusion.<br/><br/>In the T3, there is no drama in all of its action. EVERYONE knows John Connor will live and T100 will prevail over the more sophisticated TX. The challenge is make it interesting to the audience despite the obvious. In this, the T3 fails.<br/><br/>I saw this movie as a high budget action adventure with a nice plot, but nothing more. It certainly doesn't compare well against the T2."

","Previews didn't really wet my appetite to see this movie, but I just had to know what they did to continue the Terminator Franchise.  The film started off on the right track but quickly took a detour. It lacked the proper mood and style of the first two films had and definitely lacked the punch. Storylines seemed to be thrown together and loose ends were tied up with sloppy knots (if they were even tied up at all).  The acting in the film made up somewhat for the poor writing.  Arnold's lines may seem a bit corny these days, but he still kicks ass and you can't have a Terminator film without him. Nick Stahl did a decent job, but I wonder why they couldn't get Eddie Furlong. The Terminator X was kind of cool, but you can't beat the T1000 or Arnold's character in the first Terminator.  Claire Daines was a good addition to the movie.  Linda Hamilton's character is missed in this movie too.  All in all, if you like action with flat emotions behind it, it's not a bad movie.

True, it is a solid action film, but its greatness would not be achieved without a great story and top notch acting.  I was unsure how this film would measure up to the first two. After-all, this movie had all the ingredients for disaster; Director Jonathan Mostow is young and inexperienced, Arnold is quite a bit older, Kristanna Loken is a model turned actress, and the John Connor from T2 (Edward Furlong) isn't on board due to law and substance abuse problems. As it turned out, Mostow pulled it off well. Arnold is back and better than ever, Loken is no Robert Patrick*, but was still ok, and Nick Stahl makes a pretty good John Conner. I give this movie a 10/10, 2 thumbs up, or 5 stars.

Having seen the first two Terminators, but having forgotten most of what happened, I only had a vague idea what to expect. I liked the twist early on, which takes the story in a different direction than what the trailer may have suggested. This is everything an action junkie could want. It has great explosions, good battle scenes (way better than the overhyped fights in ""The Hulk""), but also has a good storyline. The comedy wasn't as intrusive as I thought it might be, and was pretty well timed. A lot of it was acceptable because it featured Arnie running off believable, but still comedic robot lines (although there were exceptions, the craziest being ""TALK TO ZE HAND!""). The female Terminator was BADASS, just relentless in her search, and NOT the blatent addition of sex appeal that she might have been. Without spoiling anything, this movie had one of the best last quarters in any recently, and the ended was almost mind-blowing and perfectly set up the next (and possibly last) installment of the series. As for the acting, it all seemed fine to me. Kristanna Loken was perfect as the T-X, and I liked the way she never ""broke character"" and threw off some stupid line. Arnold Schwarzenegger was as you'd expect - he can't act very well, so this role is perfect for him, where he can BE a robot, rather than unintentionally acting like one . Claire Danes was fine as Kate Brewster, though replaceable. My favourite role was Nick Stahl as John Connor, he was really good and convincing. Highly recommended!"

","There's a scene in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines where the `good terminator,' played vitally low-key by Arnold Schwarzeneggar, carries the man he is protecting in a coffin through a cemetery as he is ambushed by the police.  This scene is undoubtedly the most important in depicting the nature of the runty third installment in The Terminator saga: The future `Judgement Day' that has been manifested throughout these films is soon to come. 	That known, it is easy to understand this film's plot. The end is near and John Connor (Played by Nick Stahl, but previously Edward Furlong in 1991's T2: Judgement Day), the man who is to lead the revolt against the machines that will take over humanity, is found by a futuristic killing machine sent to protect him.  What this terminator is up against is a new breed of Terminator: a femme fatale who matches brawn with beauty as she seductively kills her way to John Connor and his future spouse and co-leader Kate Brewster (Claire Danes).  Her mission: to terminate John, his spouse, and their future military force team. 	This certainly is a summer for movie sequels, including X2: X-Men United, Matrix Reloaded, and Tomb Raider: Cradle Of Life.  So far I have not been let down, nor am I growing tired of seeing sequels. T3, although disappointing, is exciting as it is true to the previous films.  It gives lots of interesting explanation to the events that were discussed and feared. 	This film does suffer, however, from a general tameness.  One problem with this movie is the character of John Connor.  Although given a suitable performance by Stahl, the character does not seem like a matured version of the irritable thirteen year-old we last saw in T2.  He seems to lose his delinquent edge as he leads an `off-the-grid' life to evade any terminators. Personally, I was looking forward to seeing maturity in his testy side as well.  I think it is necessary for the character. Another reason this movie does not live up to its predecessors is that it does not have the dark and creepy vision.  This is, obviously, because of the switch in direction.  This film, directed by Jonathan Mostow (U-571), is much more surface with its scares.  We do not see the trademark build-up of tension that the director of the first two, James Cameron, masterfully delivers in some now-classic scenes.  An example of this is in the first film.  John's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) hides from Arnold Schwarzeneggar's `bad Terminator' under a desk.  It is a scene that lets us put ourselves under that desk and `feel' the terror of an unstoppable force coming looking for us.  Rise of the Machines relies on immediate action for thrills, which truly is less exciting for the audience. 	Arnold does another great job as the robot with a slight hint of humor, and something struck me as I was watching T3: how close to home the story is for him.  Arnold truly has something in common with his Terminator character in this one: they have both become obsolete in a way.  Arnold is no longer on top of the action scene as films like The Matrix are outdoing his popularity. He needs to reclaim his status as a top action hero. The terminator he plays in T3 needs to prove he can still take on the modernization of new and advanced robots that pose a serious threat. Coincidence? This summer's newest sequel is exciting as we are taken into a world that is hours away from a foretold apocalypse, but is nonetheless tame in comparison to the vision of the originals."

The ""New"" Terminator has minor weapons upgrade, using a plasma device made from her arm, but other than that, very little changed about the new hunter, and of course, the old T-101 played by Arnold, cannot be killed until the mission is complete. If you want something better than T2, you need a different movie. If you want to see what Stan Winston & ILM have done with the T-1000 to make it the T-X, I'd still say to wait for it on DVD.

","Yes, I enjoyed this movie immensely. It was no Terminator 2, but I am a huge fan of any Terminator movie. Here are my 3 contributions-<br/><br/>
1. EVERYONE seems to be addressing the issue of John Connor's age discrepancies. Yes, it makes no sense that John was born in '85 and blew up Cyberdine at age 13 (making it 1998) and is now in his early 20's. It's a detail that should be overlooked. James Cameron had a great idea for a movie- what was he supposed to do, wait several years so John would be old enough to be a punky young teenager, or make the movie in the early 90's and have John a 7 year old boy? Movies are made to entertain. If movies were based on ONLY fact, they would be dull. And if you are going into a movie about time traveling robots, you have to check some of your cynicism at the door.<br/><br/>2. I really want there to be a Terminator 4. It could wrap everything up and show the humans defeating the machines. It would be hard to do, because the actors have aged, but how cool would it be to incorporate all the time traveling missions? Show John sending Kyle, show John reprogramming and sending a T800 to protect himself as a 13 year old, and show what happens with the Terminator eventually killing John and then being reprogrammed by Kate to come back to 2003? The whole thing with John being killed by the T800 was really left open, maybe for a sequel. Why would Kate send the exact robot that killed John back to protect him? It seems almost like you're asking for trouble. If a machine killed my spouse, the last thing I would want to do would be to use that machine in a way that would help me in any way. I would want it destroyed as soon as possible. Perhaps Kate was left with no choice. Or perhaps she didn't even know that the T800 she had captured killed John. All things that are left for a part 4.<br/><br/>3. Finally, here is what I found to be most  unrealistic about the film. I haven't seen anyone else comment about this. Why would John Connor, a young man who lives more or less like a bum and apparently works construction, KNOW HOW TO OPERATE A PARTICLE ACCELERATOR???"

Soon after there meeting Kate an John find themselves in a race for there lives aganist the TX(Lokken), who is the most advanced killing machine yet, however help is not far off. The T-800(ah-nold) soon comes in an saves the day. Now with the verge of skynet taking over John, Kate, and Terminator must try an stop Judgement Day(again). The movie is filled with wall to wall action, with a chase seen like none you have ever seen. The acting is very good all around. Nick Stahl does a good job of a young man having trouble accepting his fate, Clare Danes does an excellent job of the girl who at first is lost an scared but turns out to be a kick ass help. Arnold is still very effective at being the buffed up Terminator, An Kristanna Lokken does a good job as the very lethal TX. James Cameron's direction is missed, but Jonathan Mostow does a fine job of handling it.

"Sisiutil","7","0","0","16 July 2003"," Recommended, but with qualms
","SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>After the slimy abortion that was Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, my wife had a dickens of a time convincing me to take in ANY more summer action sequels, including T3, even though we're both big fans of the first two films. Eventually, she won me over, and I'm glad she did. I enjoyed T3--even though it's merely good and not nearly as great as its predecessors.<br/><br/>There was a lot to like here. I liked the two young leads, and found both characters' development from what they are at the start of the film (John Connor's a mess; Kate Brewster's a mousy vet) to what they are at the end (future leaders of the anti-machine resistance and soon-to-be lovers) wholly believable and deftly accomplished. I especially liked the irony of how it took a machine--one of his future main enemies, a Terminator--to make Connor accept his destiny as leader of the resistance to those very machines.<br/><br/>
I also thought the downer ending was incredibly gutsy for a summer action movie. The heroes don't win! Well, eventually they will, we're told, but that's not what we're SHOWN. And Arnie--how can you not love the Teutonic Titan in the role he was born to play? Favourite line: ""I'll drive."" --delivered to a group of shocked firefighters. And it's extremely well-paced, especially once the threat of Skynet's activation comes into play.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the film has some serious problems, most of them revolving around the bad guy...uh, girl. The Terminatrix was the weakest element here. First, the obvious: as an actress, Kristanna Loken is a good model. She has nowhere near the screen presence of Arnold or Robert Patrick. When Loken flatly delivers the uninspiring ""I like your car/gun"" lines, you can't help but recall Robert Patrick's wonderfully creepy ""Say...that's a nice bike..."", not to mention Arnie's immortal ""I'll be back.""<br/><br/>Second, the concept is weak: she can form advanced weapons with her hands? So what? The previous villains in this series were viscerally terrifying: the unstoppable, scowling, hulking Arnie in T1, who got scarier as his skin came off and that metal skeleton got revealed; and creepily friendly Robert Patrick, shape-shifting his liquid metal body into those ugly, brutal ""stabbing weapons"".  <br/><br/>Third, T3 showed some lazy, sloppy work on the part of the writers when it came to our villainess. It's a bad sign when I get those ""What the f...?"" moments DURING the movie. Here's a couple of examples of what I'm talking about:<br/><br/>1) Kate's hiding, terrified, breathing AUDIBLY, in her vet clinic, and Terminator Barbie CAN'T HEAR HER?!? Come on, she's gotta have some advanced auditory sensors, and infra-red to boot. My wife suggested the T-Barbie got distracted by John Connor's presence, and realized how ridiculous that was as soon as she said it. Hey, she's a super-advanced COMPUTER, I THINK she can MULTI-TASK. Simple solution: Kate just happens to hide behind a big, noisy fridge. You've got a technically savvy audience here, guys; don't insult our intelligence.<br/><br/>2) John, Kate, and Arnie are driving away at the end of the early, nearly-interminable chase scene. T-Barbie watches them go, the back end of their Toyota truck in her sights...uh...HELLO?!? I thought this chick could form advanced weaponry, but she can't pick off a TRUCK at 200 yards?!?<br/><br/>3) T-Barbie goes right through the super-accelerator control room without noticing it's turned on or figuring out (super-computer, remember? Advanced AI?) what its powerful magnetic field will do to anything METAL once it reaches full power. And Arnie says she's smarter than he is?<br/><br/>
All in all, if I had a choice as to which of the three Terminators I'd rather go up against, I'd choose this ineffectual little minx any day. Fortunately, about half-way into the movie the nebulous Skynet becomes the true villain and its impending activation creates the real suspense.<br/><br/>T3 does end up being a largely intellectual exercise, which is remarkable for a summer action movie, granted. But it wasn't as emotionally compelling as I'd hoped. First, Sarah Connor/Linda Hamilton deserved a BIG death scene where she gave her life for John. (And the mother-in-law-to-be-with-biceps-of-steel-and-an-uzi stuff would have been fun!) Second, when John Connor accepts his destiny, you should want to stand up and cheer. Instead, I was left walking out going, ""Well, that was interesting..."" It's good, even satisfying, but not great. You can't help wondering how Cameron would have done it better. 7/10."

","When I first heard they were making 'Terminator 3' without James Cameron (the first two's co-writer and director) I immediately knew that this movie wouldn't come close to the the perfection that was 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day', a movie that in my mind is one of the greatest films ever made. So I put that out of my mind. But as the film neared release, I gained an excitement I didn't think would generate from the film. I became excited about it. It looked good. And while I didn't really think about it as the movie was being made, I had suddenly felt that this movie would be good enough to be recognized as a true edition to the franchise. Even with new writers and a new director. And my feeling paid off. While not as good as 'T2', the film is very impressive in its own right. Questions about the sequel were being answered. Like, why would more Terminators come back? Haven't we seen all there is to see? It even put new insight into the story of John Conner. I honestly didn't care what he was up to since the second movie, but now I did. Most importantly, it doesn't dwell on what the first two flicks did, which was 'Terminator chases heroes, heroes run away'. It propelled the story forward. The action was top notch and had one kick ass chase scene (every summer movie does nowadays, so it's a task to produce an exciting one). My favorite part was the T-X. The new Terminator in town, played by the beautiful Kristanna Loken, who's powers are far more advanced then previous Terminators. She played a big part in me enjoying the movie. While I'd like to highlight why, that would be spoiling it. Nick Stahl does a very convincing job at taking over the role of John Conner that was vacated by Ed Furlong. And the new addition to the pack, Kate Brewster (Clarie Danes) holds her own to make her character likeable and interesting. To be frank, I didn't think she'd have anything to bring to the table, but she proved me wrong. Overall, I was very pleased with all involved for making a worthwhile sequel, 12 years after the last movie was released! Keeping audiences interested, with such a gap in the story was a daunting task. But they delivered in spades. Even James Cameron was pleased with the result (and he hated Alien 3, he made Alien 2). So he isn't just saying that. The movie leaves open for a Terminator 4. As long as they continue to move forward with the story and not just repeat past gimmicks, I'm sure it will be good. To conclude, I love this film, and like it better than the first but not the second. I hope to see more of Kristanna in other movies...if you know what I mean<br/><br/>RATING: *** out of ****"

","Don't get me wrong, T3 is a great movie if mindless action is your kick. But if you like the story that was The Terminator, and appreciated it for what it meant, then you will not like T3 for that reason. You will like it just as you probably like all the mindless Vin Diesel crap movies.<br/><br/>T2 was a breakthrough in film making, CGI was new then, morphing, and the sound was incredible. T3 is using old tricks in a new film and that just disappointed me. I also think that T2 carried the plot from T1 and expanded on it. I think T3 separated itself from the plot and made up crap that was never meant to be in the series.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and Dr. Silberman makes a cameo in the movie... just long enough to ask Kate Brewster if she thinks the terminator is real, and then a fight breaks out, he sees the terminator again and goes running off into the background like a scene from Benny Hill. 100% Pathetic."

","I was of the school of thought that this film was going to be terrible. Arnie was too old; Jim Cameron wasn't on board; Nick Stahl was in Disturbing Behaviour! These are the sorts of things an ordinary movie could not get over.<br/><br/>T3 is not ordinary.<br/><br/>The action sequences are spectacular, even more so because they are (take note Wachowski's and Lucas) REAL! Obviously some CG effects were used but it wasn't entirely CG (which might have worked for Neo) and that in itself was a treat.<br/><br/>The director builds a real sense of pressure and a real sense of style right up until the decidedly non-Hollywood ending, which even its predecessor did, the direction is just on the right side of post-modern irony and the performances (bar one) are great.<br/><br/>This leads us nicely onto the big man himself... Mr. (Governor?) Schwarzenegger is now 56 years old, he first played the T-100 in 1984 and he has progressed through the years into a different actor to when he started.  All in all a tough assignment! He manages to just make us believe he is the T-100 again, it's amazing.  I forgot he was Arnie; all I knew was that if he wanted to he could have snapped John Connor's neck like a twig (good thing if Edward Furlong was involved).<br/><br/>Just for fairness though I must point out what I thought the weak link was Kristanna Loken, now before anyone starts I have nothing against models-turned-actors but in this case Miss Loken should have kept her mouth shut and her legs waxed.  She is just not Robert Patrick, she doesn't ever have the sense of malice that he managed to put into the T-1000 and for that she fails.<br/><br/>Anyways that's my quick review; I do recommend you go see the film when it comes out over here you really won't be disappointed"

","Many things bothered me about T3, which to describe would probably take more than a maximum of 1,000 words. One little nitpick really stood out for me, however, and seems indicative of everything wrong with the movie. T3 insists upon John Connor's being 13 years old and in the 8th grade during the events of T2. I went back to my DVD, and he is clearly identified during T2 as being ten years old. I was willing to let that go, and say it wasn't really a big deal, but then I realized there's a bigger problem. The original Terminator film clearly and unambiguously takes place in 1984. John Connor is clearly and unambiguously born in 1985. Judgment Day, before the events of T2 change the course of the fictional history, was clearly and unambiguously going to take place on August 29, 1997. (T3 still accepts that date as correct, with the whole gratuitous leukemia thing, which I won't get into). It took me all of a few seconds to see what was wrong with this picture. If John Connor was conceived in 1984 and born in 1985, he wouldn't turn 13 until a year AFTER the world was destroyed by a nuclear holocaust. The world looked in pretty good shape in T2 considering, huh? And if Sarah was supposedly diagnosed with cancer three years before 1997, John would have been nine years old -- younger than he originally was during T2, while Sarah would probably have been in Pescadero.<br/><br/>Why is this important? In the course of sequels, things are going to get tweaked to make the new movie work. Certain things may get re-written or reinterpreted. But the anchoring dates of 1984 and 1997 are basic and important facts about the world the Terminator series is set in. The filmmakers were paid incredible amounts of money to make this film, and either couldn't be bothered to do simple math that an elementary schooler could do, or they did do the math, and decided to arbitrarily ignore it, to make a change that really has no pay-off and adds no meaning to the film. I paid $5 to see this film. They're getting back millions. And I offhandedly know more about the world of the film, and care more about it, than they do. This shows a casual contempt for anyone who cared enough about the first two movies to actually bother paying attention to the plot. The exact same people whose money they anticipated taking when they decided to make another sequel in the first place. This isn't a movie with any meaning: it's a cynical cash cow."

"Apple Scruff","7","0","0","13 July 2003"," Exceeded all my expectations
","What can I say, but I really enjoyed Terminator 3.  The key, I believe, was to go in expecting to be let down.  2003 has been and will continue to be a sequel-happy year, filled with instantly forgettable rehashes of successful films in order to see if lightning would strike twice, or thrice, or who knows how many more times.  Since the first two Terminator films were so incredibly good and T2 ended on such a fantastic note, I didn't think another good entry into the Terminator franchise was possible, especially since a) Arnold isn't young anymore, b) Linda Hamilton was not involved, and c) neither was Jim Cameron. I was expecting a sub-par action flick with mediocre special effects and painfully shallow performances all around. While the amazing Linda Hamilton's presence was sorely missed, as was the direction (not necessarily the dialogue) of James Cameron, T3 really delivered! It was a great deal of fun and excitement, exactly what a summer moviegoer should want to see during a season known for idiot movies.<br/><br/>
I am very hard to please in the summertime since SO much trash comes out and most so-called films released between June and August insult my intelligence beyond forgiveness. While not as fresh, intriguing, and thought-provoking as the first two, Terminator 3 actually, surprisingly, had somewhat of a brain! The story was well-conceived, the special effects were out of the park incredible (given the budget, they'd BETTER have been!), Arnold was in great shape, and most strikingly, the performances were very strong indeed!<br/><br/>
While Arnold Schwarzenegger's speaking performance was limited mostly to expository dialogue, short commands or replies (""Negative"", ""Get down!"", ""Take the wheel""), he gave a delightfully campy, tongue-in-cheek portrayal of the part tailor-made for him. His deadpan quips were in the ""lame and predictable, but can't help laughing and smiling"" category.  As for the stunts and his fights with the new T-X supervillain, or ""Terminatrix"" (played adequately enough by stone-faced stunner Kristanna Loken), they were outstanding. At times, the physical confrontations between the two make the classic fights between Arnold's T-101 and Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2 look like a schoolyard spat. I kept seeing dollar signs popping up with all the cars, buildings, etc. that were destroyed.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most inspired casting, however, were Claire Danes as Kate Brewster and Nick Stahl as John Connor.  I NEVER would have expected Claire Danes to fit well into a Terminator movie, but she was a gem! First of all, she's looking great these days. She has such attractive features, but in more of a classical way.  Whereas Loken's looks make guys simply say, ""She's hot!"", Danes has more of the look of a girl that a respectable man would want to introduce to his family.  She played her part excellently and remembered to have a good time doing it, as one can see while watching her.<br/><br/>
Nick Stahl was perfectly cast as reluctant hero John Connor.  He had a look in his eyes of a man with a haunting past (and future) as the role requires. There was a wonderful sense of urgency and despair in his voice that told me that he understood the part completely. His character's frustration came through perfectly and I know purists say that Eddie Furlong should've played him, but I disagree. Furlong was okay as young John, but nowadays he just doesn't have a certain look that Conner should have (no offense to Eddie. loved him in American History X).  Stahl has such a strong dark side, it's a shame the part of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars Episodes II and III didn't go to him, as he would have probably done very well.<br/><br/>Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.  T3 packed a nice summer popcorn movie punch and a very clever ending.  Considering the expectations and the dynamite of potentially alienating diehard Terminator fans, director Mostow, whose exciting 1997 B-movie Breakdown showed a great deal of promise, has earned his wings in the annals of action moviemaking."

It was well worth the million.

Aside the constant barrage of cliches and overall bad acting, the one thing that errked me more than anything is that Jonathan Mostow completly ignored the first two movies, and decided that he would make one that went completely against any of the ideals held sacred by most fans of the series.  He decided that ""Fate is what we make"", and ""The future is not set"" were just too happy.  In this movie we find John Conner 10 years after the last movie ended.  He's a shell of a man, living day to day, staying 'below the radar'.  He still has nightmares of the Judgement Day future, and his role in leading humanity's survivors to victory over the machines.  He happens to end up in an animal hospital run by the daughter (Claire Danes) of the man who finally develops 'Skynet'. The T-X and a T-800 are both sent back to Kill/Protect John's lieutenants this time around.  They both find Claire Danes and Nick Stahl at the same time, and the long chase begins.  Blah Blah Blah...  lot of fighting actio n CG stuff... guns... Arnold's infinite bag of Terminator saying cliches... you get the point.  Anyway, John Conner find out that Claire Danes' father is the creator of 'SkyNet', and the group advances on the secret underground military complex where her father works.  T-X follows, and first generation Terminator machines are involved, more fighting... Okay, well, to get to the point, finally, Claire's father sends her and John to the supposed location of the 'SkyNet' central brain, and they end up in a cave-room with nothing but outdated computers and enough food to live for a year or two underground.  They both finally figure out that there was no stopping 'SkyNet' because it was an Odyssey 5 ripoff Artificial Intelligence virus, and not a program solely located in a single computer.

On the other hand, it also opens the possibility of a T4, so maybe it's not brave but rather cunning of them. Mostow is pretty good. When John drops the beer bottle and that starts a segue to the future, when John rides the motorcycle and we barely see his face, or when they arrive at Crystal Peak and everything seems so dated, so ""Dr. Strangelove"" or even ""Colossus, the Forbin Project"" and finally, when I heard those last few lines, ""it was software, there was no core"".

It is a clever film to make Arnold into an American hero. Arnold plays a cyborg, a reformed enemy, who is now on the side of humans, who are fighting in a war against the machines who have destroyed the American Way of life.  He has been sent back into the past (our present) to prevent John Connor from being assassinated by a sexy Terminatrix (who always looks beautiful and nicely dressed no matter how much damage she endures -- vice versa for Arnold the cyborg, who literally looks like a wreck at the end of the film).    The movie is about John Conner and the Terminator, who has been Connor's father figure.  Both endure a personal crisis and learn to grow.  John Conner becomes the hero he is destined to become but he needed help.  The Terminator believes in his destiny and does whatever he can to save from him harm until John Connor reaches his potential. The Terminator, who deems himself as obsolete, becomes corrupted and tries to kill John Connor but he fights against his own program, reboots, and becomes a brand, spanking new cyborg.   He sacrifices himself to take out the Teminatrix.  The Terminator's main function was not to save John Connor but to inspire him.  John Connor becomes the new American hero because of the Terminator. This is the image Arnold wants voters to think when Gray Davis is recalled.  Arnold knows he is too old to be the action hero anymore but he has seen action (mostly on film), he is on our side, and he will inspire the young men so that when Judgment Day comes they will be waving Old Glory."

It compels you to pop the original Terminator, or Terminator 2: Judgment Day, into the DVD player/VCR when you come home from the theater, and realize all over again how unbelievably strong the first two films are, especially in comparison to this weak third installment.  Because, other than a noteworthy performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger, some good set design, and a few small touches that recall T1 & T2, the film cannot compensate for poor pacing, lack of a cohesive point-of-view, and a complete turnabout of the fundamental philosophy behind the whole series.  ""The future is not set"" captures the essence of the character's struggle against the machines--the belief that even the least among us could make a difference.  Whereas if T3 is to be believed, perhaps we should all simply accept our fate and go along with the plan--after all, it makes for better SFX.  The machines have apparently already won this war."

I like a good story to back up the action, and I did think I could get that from a Terminator movie, as has happened in the past.<br/><br/>That's why this movie needed Cameron.  It's Cameron's story.  Without him, this movie falls flat.  It all feels too uneventful for a movie about the arrival of Judgement Day, the most important day in human history.  This whole movie takes place in only one day.  In that one day two Terminators come and go, a military secret is exposed, John Connor leaves his life as a recluse and regains his passion for saving the world and falls in love with a previously unknown character, Kate Brewster.  That's the most disturbing part of the movie - this new character that turns out to be one of the most important aspects of the human resistance.  Coincidentally, she was in fact a part of John's life before and could have just as much been a part of T2. But she wasn't, and we have no reason to care for her.  Not only that, but she seems all too willing to take on her role as a leader.  At the beginning of the day she was running an animal clinic and she happily engaged.  At the end of the day, her fiance has died (which she gets over quickly), she falls in love with another man she barely knows, and she has an overwhelming fervor to lead the human race.  It doesn't work.  This can't be what Cameron envisioned for his characters.

To be fair, there were some funny moments, and the face-off between Arnold and the female robot at the end was interesting, but unfortunately, by that time, it was too little, too late.  What is really sad is to read how much everyone enjoyed the movie; it's too bad our standards for entertainment have deteriorated to the degree that quick editing, special effects, and constant movement without benefit of plot or coherent character development passes for decent moviemaking.

"rparham","7","0","0","14 July 2003"," A pleasant surprise
","Terminator 3:  Rise of the Machines was a film that had the potential to be a complete disaster.  The second sequel to a well-respected action film, lacking the presence of it's superstar original director (James Cameron), and the most recent film from an aging and recently hit-free action star (Arnold Schwarzenegger).  This is not to mention the 10+ year gap between this film and it's previous entry.  However, when the lights go down, Terminator 3 surprises.  It is, while hardly a masterpiece, an entertaining and engaging piece of action cinema, and perhaps the best action film of the year to date.<br/><br/>Most people are familiar with the basic outline of the plot, which this sequel once again follows:  John Connor (Nick Stahl, replacing Edward Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance against the machines that conquer the world, is ""living off the grid"", with no phone number, no address, no attachments.  However, even though he believes that the future is safe after the destruction of the nascent supercomputer Skynet in Terminator 2, he still feels he should live in the shadows.  He is right. Skynet has once again decided to take a crack at eliminating his future adversary, and has sent back a new killing machine, the T-X (Kristanna Loken), to stop the future from turning out poorly for those composed of chips and software.  And, once again, the human resistance has decided to blow the dust off an obsolete model of human-killing metal, the T-101, who comes equipped with the rock-jawed visage of one Austrian body-builder.  He must protect not only Connor, but his future right-hand woman, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), who is a little, um, reluctant, to believe she will lead the human race in a post-apocalyptic future to victory against sentient machines.  And she doesn't even get to take a pill to determine her fate.<br/><br/>Where the film succeeds is in it's realization that it is, first and foremost, an action film.  It isn't interested in being much more than that, but it also is smart enough to not over-reach. It is fast-paced and well-constructed, and it handles itself effectively, full of action, but not seemingly over-done.  The film gets off to great start early on, with a spectacular multi-vehicle chase that rivals the Matrix Reloaded for sheer speed and audacity.  Featuring police cruisers, ambulances and a giant mobile crane, it is a stand-out sequence that few action films this year can really top.<br/><br/>Jonathan Mostow, the director, has some big shoes to fill, replacing the ""King of the World"", but he takes charge of the film well, allowing it all to flow effectively.  One major element of the film's success is the performance of Kristanna Loken as the T-X.  Like Robert Patrick before her, she is effectively distant, giving her T-X a cold demeanor belied by her rather comely exterior.  She gives the character a fluid sense of motion that is half animal, half machine.  And, while some may have believed that having a female antagonist would be destined to fall into the bimbo or super-bitch category, the screenwriters have crafted some scenes that display the value of a female killing machine in a male dominated world (a scene where police officer pulls her over and she uses her liquid metal exterior to craft larger breasts is one example).  She is every bit Schwarzenegger's match.<br/><br/>And speaking of the aforementioned superstar, Schwarzenegger is able to shake off his recent failures and is back in top form with Terminator 3.  He fits the role perfectly again, and this time the screenwriters have decided to have some fun with him, giving him some neat one-liners that are, unlike seemingly similar material in the abysmal Batman & Robin, genuinely funny. The character is not a self-parody, but a little looser than before.<br/><br/>One aspect that put Terminator 2 over the top in terms of memorability was it's then ground-breaking use of computer animation to craft it's villain, and it would be reasonable to assume Terminator 3 would try to top it. However, Mostow and crew have realized that they can't really compete with what has come recently, and don't even try.  This works beautifully though. Instead of being distracted by constant bombardment of eye-candy, the film rides on it's stunt sequences and action set-pieces, and this is the right approach I think.  There are visual effects on display here, and they are expertly well-done, and pretty seamlessly integrated into the film. <br/><br/>
Terminator 3 is not a film that will redefine cinema as we have come to know it, and has it's occasional gaps in logic and credibility, but nothing so glaring that it is distracting.  It simply does the job it was designed to do, and does it well.  What more can an audience ask."

","It is an enjoyable movie, if you are expecting some action, and ready to letgo any inconsistencies or loopholes. There are many instances, where T3 could have killed John Connor with her weapon. But just by director's grace, she changes her mind. Also, it is impossible to believe, that machines with so advanced features cannot track down a single person, or can have X-Ray vision, as to track down John Connor when he was locked inside a cage.<br/><br/>The picture does not appeal emotionally. The whole scene of Sarah Connor in mental asylum was quite touching one. Even chemistry between Arnold and John Connor was interesting in T2. However, here, as in the case with ""The Matrix Reloaded"", emphasis is more on technical wizardary rather than emotions. The relation between Arnold and John Connor is taken as granted. It seems as if there is no emotional bonding between them.<br/><br/>But still the movie is worth watching once. Too bad, it does not have a repeat value"

","Ha!  I love the user's comments about this being the first Terminator movie since the ""gay '90s"" kicked in.  It really does seem to fit...  See, you have Arnold, who's square-headed, German, muscular and waxed and he plays a robot (or ""cybernetic organism"", excuse me, Ms. Thang).  This is actually the third ""him"" to star in these movies, as it seems he is merely one of many copies of the same model (""gay clones"", anyone?).  Arnold appears in the present day world in a time rift the shape of a BALL.  JAGGED lightning crackles around it.  Arnold is naked.  He goes to a roadside club in the desert that is having ""Ladies' Night"", which just means a gay male stripper is dancing there.  The bearded biker bouncer guy at the door sees the naked Arnold and tells him ""you'll have to go to the back"".  Anyway, if you've seen the movie, you know the rest.  Okay, the girl Terminator comes to the present and is naked and has Venus De Milo hair which instantly changes moments later (thank god for that liquid metal hair).  She walks up to this lady and says, ""I like your car"".  Moments later she is seen in the car, wearing a leather outfit.  That lady was wearing a shawl!  ?  I won't even start on the holes in the logic of this movie, they're too many.  The chase scene is impressive, moreso than in Matrix 2.  It was difficult to tell what was CGI and what was real.  Thinly drawn characters you couldn't care about, stupid dialogue, terrible attempts at humor...  Truly a Terminator movie for our time."
"Mulliga","7","0","0","12 July 2003"," An incredibly disappointing and disgustingly commercial 3rd film - shame on everyone involved (SPOILERS, but a true T2 fan should never see this one)
","I was in the U.S. Virgin Islands (which have no movie theatres) during the opening weekend of July 4th. Like many fans, the trailers left me afraid that the franchise's third installment would turn into another Alien 3. I heard reviews saying the film wasn't bad, and even actually good. I went into the theatre expecting an above-average summer action flick and a decent continuation of the Terminator saga. What I got was a big, fat stinker of a movie.<br/><br/>There is a scene VERY early on in T3 that signals the start of the end.<br/><br/>Like most people, I watched T2 on DVD before seeing T3 to ""get in the mood."" It held up very well, of course, and I even felt compelled to watch the documentaries on the making of the movie. Cameron said, ""It's important not to go too far and make the Terminator a clown figure."" Cameron gave Arnold plenty of sombre, stoic scenes to emphasize the serious nature of this killing machine.<br/><br/>In T3, Arnie gets a set of clothes from someone else like in the first two movies. Except, this time, the victim isn't a street tough or a biker: it's a gay stripper at a ladies' bar. When Arnold reaches into the coat for a pair of sunglasses, he pulls out ridiculous Elton John-esque shades. People in the audience chuckled, but I knew in my heart that they were making fun of one of the most memorable villains/heroes ever at the movie's expense.<br/><br/>T3 plays like one of those movies shown on the brilliant cartoon ""The Critic"" - cornball humor, overdone action, and little underlying meaning. Mostow, while obviously a fan of the material, doesn't have much in the way of execution. The trademark Terminator feel is gone; no more cold blues, gritty blacks, and warm colors. The pacing of the movie is okay, but the ""look"" of the movie is all wrong and feels artificial.<br/><br/>That brings me to the sad part of the review. CGI SHOULD BE BANNED FROM MOVIES FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS. Why do the special effects of T2, a movie made more than a decade ago, look more realistic than T3? In a move that will inevitably be likened to ""The Phantom Menace,"" Mostow overuses CGI almost from the very start. The TX is completely unbelievable as a deadly weapon - she looks more like a video game character. The nuclear holocaust of T2, one of the finest depictions of a nuclear blast ever put to film, is a computer-generated mess that looks really, really bad in T3. The future war scenes, once gritty and intense, are actually kind of boring. The stunts and fighting, once rooted in some of the best practical effects work in the business, are almost all obviously done on a blue screen or in a computer. I mean, THE ""BATTLE ACROSS TIME"" SHOW AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS (also directed by Cameron) looks better than this movie! (and it was more satisfying...)<br/><br/>Arnold and the cast do an okay job with the stuff written for them. Claire Danes and Nick Stahl worked well, but why couldn't they hire somebody that looked like Eddie Furlong? Leonardo DiCaprio (of all people) would've been a better choice, since he's a dead ringer for Edward and even worked with Claire Danes in ""Romeo + Juliet"". Kristanna Loken lacks the menace and presence of Robert Patrick, even though she says even fewer lines (she doesn't even talk for the last half of the movie!). Arnold still looks good, but (and this is partially the script's fault) you never feel like he's Terminator - he feels like Arnold. The bit players feel okay but slightly hackneyed. There's a cameo by Dr. Silberman for the fans, but Silberman doesn't feel like the Silberman in the past two movies.<br/><br/>That brings the problem of continuity. The Terminator POV screens in this one look nothing like the first two. The music is all different - I long for Brad Fiedel's driving techno-industrial score, not Marco Beltrami's forgettable drivel. I am definitely not happy with the whole idea of Connor's ""lieutenants"" - why the hell does Connor have to save the world, anyway? If he has more than half a dozen lieutenants, couldn't someone else take his place?<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the story as a whole isn't bad. I'm kind of miffed that they threw out the whole ""the future's not set"" angle, but the ending was decent. It's just that the silly, botched execution of an inexperienced, b-grade director brings down the film.<br/><br/>2 out of four stars"

What i liked was the villian was more in step with the original terminator film. A popcorn and coke film T3 boasts hollywood stunts and eyegrabbing special effects. However many of the attributes that make this film worthwhile hurt it criticaally. The film has plot holes and continuity problems as big as nebraska. The plot holes are of a scope and breadth I would expect in a z grade action picture but not in a first rate action film; these plot holes I might add never show up in the first two films.

Although not as great as parts 1 or 2, Terminator 3 is a terrific summer movie. Great action, mindless violence and pure wackiness. And what makes it better, a cool story that I've followed for 20 years (since I was a kid)! I'm so glad they didn't go ""hollywood"" on the storyline. If they had, I would hate this movie with a passion. I give them credit for keeping it ""true"". For those who have seen the movie, I hope you know what I'm referring to. If you don't know what I mean, then you certainly did not understand the movie!<br/><br/>I'll admit going into this movie I was reluctant to ""like"" it. The original ""Terminator"" director did not work on this, Linda Hamilton did not sign on, plotline was sort of ""typical"", and a ""bad chick"" terminator was kind of lame. But I liked it. If anything, it's fun. If it wasn't summer, I might give it 4 out of 5 stars. But its summer and I'm in the mood for this stuff! 5 stars out of 5!"
"hales_r_us","6","0","0","11 July 2003"," well...it's certainly funny
","This movie was definately missing something without James Cameron and Linda Hamilton.  The special effects were fantastic, and everything else was lukewarm. There was the fair share of humor in this movie that wasn't in the earlier ones...our society has made such a joke out of Arnold's mannerisms and accent in this movie that they movie itself makes fun of it.  For example, when Nick Stahl is asking the Terminator if he remembers John from before, and he's like ""Do the words 'Asta la Vista, baby' mean anything to you?"" and so forth. This movie also takes advantage of the fact that the T-X is a really hot blonde 5'11 woman.  Very corny parts with her include when she gets pulled over and, spotting the Victoria's Secret ""What is Sexy"" billboard, makes her breasts grow about 5 inches...and then when the cop comes she says in her seductive voice, ""I like your GUN."" In terms of acting, it's what you'd expect from a Terminator movie...Arnold IS the Terminator, so no complaints there, and Nick Stahl fills in nicely as John Connor, though I think I speak for a lot of people when I say it would have been nice to see Eddie Furlong again.  Claire Danes was a little more sketchy.  A lot of her movies have been either flops (Polish Wedding, the Mod Squad) or just plain bad (Brokedown Palace), but she has made enough of a career out of pretty good movies (the Hours, Romeo and Juliet, Igby Goes Down) that I don't think the hard core action is her thing.  She's like a little girl in the movie and just looks uncomfortable blowing things up with machine guns...although the script has given her some scenes that were so lame that it would be hard for anyone to act them well ( ie telling the T-X to ""Just die you bitch!""). Overall, this movie was alright...the humor and action make it enjoyable, and any hardcore Terminator fan will enjoy."

","Abysmal.<br/><br/>James Cameron's first two Terminator movies were among the greatest action movies made and are compelling even after numerous viewings as Cameron knows how to tell a story.<br/><br/>Jonathan Mostow, along with hordes of writers and producers, creates a typical Hollywood action movie that captures none of the feel of the originals.  It seems as if no thought were given to any aspect of this movie except its special effects.  The pacing is terrible, removing any sense of dread or feeling of suspense.  The acting is likewise cardboard and you feel no sympathy for Connor or Brewster.  Bizarrely, Arnold, through use of comic gimmicks, bad writing, and little acting, is totally unconvincing as a robot (the one role he seemed able to successfully play) and becomes mostly buffoonish.<br/><br/>If this movie had been made without Terminator in the title and without Arnold in the cast, it would not have made $100, as it's totally uninspired and unconvincing.  Instead, people are flocking to it to for the wrong reasons.  James Cameron (with help from Linda Hamilton, William Wisher Jr, and ideas culled from Harlan Ellison) was what made the original movies works of art.  It was not the special effects or Arnold.  It was good storytelling.<br/><br/>Perhaps rather than hoping Cameron is cursing Mostow for the terrible quality of this sequel, I should be hoping that Mostow is weeping at what at hack he is, knowing he contributed to a multi-million dollar scam against movie goers."
"Gideon40","Null","0","0","11 July 2003"," A surprisingly good sequel with a good story and great ending
","I'll admit, I was sure T3 was going to blow because Cameron wasn't directing it, and that the plot initially sounded like T2's, and was basically going to be a rehash. I was afraid this movie was going to destroy the Terminator series. Thankfully, it did not. Terminator 3 combines great acting, a story that explains itself well, and excellent action scenes.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Nick Stahl plays a rather reluctant and fearful John Connor who refuses to believe that he is still being hunted by a Terminator even though cyberdyne was destroyed. Arnold Schwarzenneger, the star of the show, is also very good, retaining his deadpan, robotic behavior and tone of voice. It seems the resistance turned on his learning computer before they sent him back in time, because he is able to, well, learn in this movie (this makes more sense if you saw the uncut T2). This makes for some comic relief, that, while making the movie seem a little lighthearted at first, does not disrupt its overall dark nature. Claire Danes is also pretty good. She isn't your typical squeamish female character. While she is more fearful than John Connor, she ultimately becomes a more determined character after realizing her role, much like Sarah Connor in T1. Overall the acting is well done, and it certainly does help convey the whole despairty of the situation, and the characters' determination to accomplish their goals.<br/><br/>The story was pulled off well. T2 saw John Connor realize his role, and become a less worthless person into a someone who can actually make decisions. As you will see in T3, John's first real test comes in. I can't say much more without spoiling the whole thing. While the story isn't as powerful and insightful as T2's, it is much darker and is filled with dispair. The ending was very moving, with the way the narration was done, and the tone of the music.<br/><br/>The action scenes, whose quality is essential to any Terminator movie, were extremely well done. The car chase was very well done, because it was fast, and each crash and slam was done with the right camera angle and sound effect that you can feel the impact yourself. The camera changes are done quite quickly, but it maintains a wide angle on things, and a close angle on others so that the chase is effectively conveyed to be chaotic and messy, but at the same time you can see what is going on. The fight scenes were also good. Like the car chase, each punch and slam has a huge impact in sound and visuals. I mean, when you see one of the terminators get punched or thrown across a room, you can really feel the impact in you! They were also well cheographed. While the matrix films have a balletic and lightning fast quality to their fight scenes, the Terminator films' fights have a more brutal and hard hitting quality. Overall the action scenes were very well done. There was none of that shaky camera nonsense which I get so sick of.<br/><br/>There is of course, a noticable flaw to the film. While T2 explained how the T-1000 was able to track the characters no matter where they went, T3 does not. The TX shows up almost everywhere the protagonists go without explaining how it found out(Except for the cemetary). I hope that a DVD release will in some way explain this.<br/><br/>T3 is a worthy sequel. It doesn't have the epic quality that Cameron produced, it is still well done. To the regular viewer it is a great popcorn flick that isn't your standard hollywood action flick fair. To the terminator fan, it is a good medium to forward the story of Terminator and to show Ah-nuld kicking arse again."

The ending of T2 was really very touching. You even cared about Arnold the Robot! In T3, there is no real character development, and except for saving the human race, in this film, there is no one to root for because there is no emotional connection with the human characters, not to mention with the terminator or terminatrix. This film is much more violent than the others, and the action has no real purpose, direction, or shape. The filmmaker seems to think that loud means exciting, but it got very wearing after awhile, not to mention repetitive. I even fell asleep in the first half-hour, despite the noise!

Unfortunately, I never did see both full length movies of T1 and T2, however I did see the ending when I tuned into the TV. <br/><br/>I personally enjoyed this movie very much. It even made sense to the viewer who hadn't seen the original two made by James Cameron. The special effects were awesome as was the car chase scene. I also give kudos to the writers for making the TX feel more like a cold, cut throat mechanical object, than just a piece of eye candy and of course she had lots of fight in her. There was also plenty of comedy relief thoughout and it was good to see the film poking fun at itself and at the Terminator franchise.<br/><br/>So, where does the film fall apart?. In my opinion, it fell at the ending. It all went down hill when Arnold aka T-850 fails to kill John Connor and just shuts down. That seemed a bit too easy for me, when it had potential to be a lot more. Also, when he boots back up he is back to normal without TX's malicious programing controlling his mind. Again too easy.<br/><br/>There was also the final confrontation, where they try to escape to the air base. The TX just gets crushed by the helicopter and comes back out without her liquid metal on. What happened to that?. I guess, I'm not too much into saving the world type stuff and about big bombs about to go off. Maybe its because Hollywood endings always have people defuse the bomb at the last second or because I can't see it as happening when I'm sitting omfortably in my chair. The death scene between Arnold and the TX was good but in my opinion typical. And at the end John and that other girl are in the base. Safe from all the nuclear missles going on.<br/><br/>It was great on one hand, because the Terminator was smart enough to change course and accomplish his mission when John threatened to kill himself, and yet it just feels so hollow, I mean you knew he was never meant to die and so what, he lives. Sure there's meaning to the ending, but it just ends so abruptly and is so pointless ,only setting itself up for another movie."

Nick Stahl plays a believable, somewhat scruffy-looking John Connor, and Kristanna Loken (T-X) and Claire Danes (Kate) are welcome additions to the Terminator Universe.<br/><br/>In keeping with the machines' evolution, the T-X seems to be an amalgamation of the T-800 (endoskeleton) and T-1000 (liquid metal) with its own unique abilities--it can form its own weapons.

The good twist to the story line was that Mile's Dyson was the brains to SKYNET but he was not responsible for the launch.  In fact, SKYNET was a military idea and SKYNET had to keep Robert Brewster alive and only kill him after the launch, as he will turn against the machines that he was once responsible for.

","Those looking for extreme action this summer best catch a glimpse at Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. This is a movie that features pure action and nothing more. There are massive gun fights, car chases, explosions, the whole lot. T3 is a fast-paced action thriller that grabs you and never lets go. Arnold Schwarzenegger looks great for a 55-year old man and kicks serious ass in this film. Kristanna Lohken (who plays the T-X) is a sexy villain who enjoys kicking Arnold's ass all over the place (including a bathroom stall). So for those looking for nothing but action will truly get their money's worth after seeing this movie. <br/><br/>However, I prefer to look for more than action. I want to see just a slight bit of drama in this type of movie. T3 offers little to no drama except at the very end of the film (I will not reveal the ending because it is a surprise) Even so, you could probably see the ending coming since Arnold's character keeps hinting at it throughout the film. That is where T3 falters as a picture. The screenplay is so predictable and carries too many cliches. Also, there are too many comical lines which damage the film's credibility. As a result, what you see on the screen is a full-scaled action picture littered with explosive stunts and amazing special effects. T3 does not have the James Cameron touch that was present in the first two films which weakens it as well. T2 was much better because it was able to incorporate more emotion between John Connor and the Terminator all while presenting you with explosive stunts and special effects. Frankly, I missed Edward Furlong playing John Connor. He gave an incredible performance in T2 and Nick Stahl's portrayal is weak with no emotion whatsoever. It feels like he's trying his best not to act but to just get through his lines, which he can't do because of the weak screenplay. Claire Danes's character of Kate Brewster shows some emotion but not enough to make you feel for your loss. The only time you feel eligible to shed a tear is at the very end of the film.<br/><br/>
Yet I believe that T3's pure action method saves it from becoming a failure of a movie which I why I praise it. It is a film solely for the people who want action and only action. It is also for the people who want to see Arnold kick a woman's ass and the woman kicking his ass as well. Although there is no drama, T3 is able to successfully continue the action half of the Terminator franchise which makes it a good film but not great.<br/><br/>

","Yeah, this is a wonderful movie, I like it a lot. Jonathan Mostow (yes, he is a lot better than the 'king of the world') is a god, he made a better Terminator film, than James Cameron ever made. This movie is a lot better than the first two: better script, better music, better actors (except Arnold, he is good again:) and better directing. Cameron (Hey, you! Go to the cinema and go to practice from Mostow!) fans will do not like this movie, but who cares... It was really good to wait 12 years for this fantastic movie!!!

","Small spoilers follow; I describe a few scenes but don't give much away. While I'm not exactly an authority on the first two films, I recall well enough what happens in those, and this one makes a good follow up.  Despite this film's somewhat wandering plot and cliché cliffhanger of an ending, it is pretty enjoyable.  The acting is not spectacular, but two of the four central characters are supposed to be robots, so what do you expect?  The camerawork is often interesting, and the film has quite a few humorous moments.  The action is great (but not incredible) throughout.  The chase, while obviously enormously expensive, had sort of a breakneck speed.  While I'm aware that this is the nature of car chases, the pace of the cutting removed my ability to focus on the action and get a real sense of suspense (see the motorcycle/truck chase of the second).  Much of the movie is at least somewhat gripping, though, and I found myself wanting to know what will happen next more often than waiting for the standard fare to play itself out.  The premise with its innumerable incarnations still manages to support the film without seeming too stale. I think most will agree that the one-on-one duel between the machines is quite a spectacle.  Overall, solid action and worth seeing.  [6/10]"

","Spoilers<br/><br/>The Terminator is the only character that got into both the top 50 heroes and top 50 villains lists. Strictly speaking, there are two different characters, villain in T1 and hero in T2. By the same token, T3 comes back as yet a different character, as ¡§he¡¨ tells John Connor who has now grown up. Villain T-1000, ¡§the mercury man¡¨ (which actually is the name of a comic hero in the 60's, I believe) is now replaced by T-X (¡§x¡¨ as in the common female gender notation) played by beautiful Kristanna Loken.<br/><br/>Before I went to see T3, I knew I was going to miss Linda Hamilton, whose very human sense of urgency and determination was a perfect balance against the unreal, mechanical overtone of the movie. I am glad to find is that this role has been competently taken up by Claire Danes.  <br/><br/>Struggling against drowning in the proliferation of action flicks, every movie in this genre will try to have something it can be remembered by. Loken serves much of that purpose. In the action department, without the wire-fu fights, eye-dazzling movements or imaginative supernatural/mutant powers, T3 labours hard at demolition and explosions. The wrecking crane of the truck and the crash landing of the two copters should bring out secret desires of even the most well behaved kids. I, for one, finally gratified, feel a little bit better for not having had the guts to smash all the toy trucks, cars and planes I once had, decades ago.<br/><br/>Good old Arnie is still in great shape, as one hell of a funny robot. Many of his five-word-average lines are really funny, and the more remarkable because spoken by a robot, they make perfect sense and shouldn't even be funny.<br/><br/>I'd give T3 higher than passing grade but at the same time, I can't help wondering where can T4 go? The fugitive formula has already been over-used. If the producers go for an all out epic war, they'll have to hope that people won't get tired after watching the defence of Zion and Star Wars Episode 3. But then, if it's going to take another 12 years, maybe it's ok. Let's wait and see."

","This could easily have been a disaster. With James Cameron, Linda Hamilton, Brad Fiedel (composer) nowhere in sight for this movie and Arnie's career in the gutter for the past ten years, the whole project had a feel of ""let's try to save Arnie's career one last time"" and ""let's try to make a quick buck off the Terminator franchise"".<br/><br/>I had serious doubts the 56-year old Arnold could still command the screen like he used to. And I had grave doubts about the idea of a female villain - with T-1000 from T2 being one of the ultimate movie villains of all time in my opinion, throwing in a woman seemed like something the movie-makers were trying to do just to be ""different"". Plus her being robotic again seemed like a step down from T2's polymorphic terminator. Nick Stahl didn't seem like an appealing choice for John Connor either. And the idea of Claire Danes seemed like an artificial drag-along in order for our hero to ""have a girlfriend"".<br/><br/>The only sign of hope was the big budget. With an accepted budget of $170-$200 million, they HAD to make a movie which can rely on more than just the opening weekend box office. And I was relieved to find out that they DID!<br/><br/>Of course I realize that with such low expectations, it would have been easy for the movie to exceed them. But that is hardly the case here - T3 is not only the action movie of the year, it is without a doubt one of the BEST action movies of all time. I was happy to see Arnie back on top - even if it is for just this one movie. I was happy to see the female terminator was actually a step up from T-1000. I was happy to see Nick Stahl being just PERFECT for the role. The eerie atmosphere of T1 was back and the action (especially the fighting and car-chase sequences) absolutely DECIMATED Matrix Reloaded even without having to rely on either CGI slow-motion, bullet-time photography or dangling from wires. The movie was even able to handle the usual stumbling-place of all action movies - the ending - surprisingly well.<br/><br/>As far as action movies go - 10 out of 10."

","While T-1 delivered an action-packed and original story on an amazingly low budget, and T-2 added considerable depth and spectacular special effects, the third element of the T-Trilogy seems to be a step backwards.<br/><br/>It's not all bad, mind you. All the usual action features are well done and the car chase scene is spectacular (if slightly drawn out). John Connor is also a convincing dropout trying to avoid his fate - a nice contrast with the sometimes annoyingly self-confident Connor of T-2.<br/><br/>But what this installment fails to deliver is any real innovation. It ties up a few loose ends and adds a few arbitrary twists, but it just felt a little empty in comparison to the first two.<br/><br/>If you're a sci-fi, Arnold or action flick fan, then this is a must-see.

Some of it is a little trite and, needless to say, it is almost entirely predictable, right down to the final scenes. But its Arnie, doing what Arnie does best.....breaking things.<br/><br/>There are some nice views of the prototype hunter-killers that characterised the flashbacks in the second movie. But I swear one of the T1's shrugged after looking down a corridor for the intruders (Arnie and Co). Might have been my imagination, though.<br/><br/>Anyway, good fun, but nothing new.

"traviskramer","Null","0","0","10 July 2003"," This movie broke my heart
","Terminator 3 caused some reflection on my part. Normally I don't go see a movie and feel like that after the credits start to roll.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the reflection didn't have much to do with the quality of the film itself.<br/><br/>Certain films are near and dear to us. For me it's films like The Princess Bride, Aliens, Casablanca, and the Terminator pictures. You've seen them until they feel like an old friend. And to find out someone is going to tinker with them makes you nervous. In the case of Terminator 3, the film leaves you feeling like you got kicked in the gut. Maybe it's not fair to judge the film against my memories, or for that matter the quality of the other films, but the film makers chose to produce it and I paid my eight bucks for the right to pass judgement.<br/><br/>Director Jonathan Mostow should have thought more on this: If you chose to create a sequel to an existing film series, I would hope that you are doing it to actually move the story forward, and not to make a buck. I'll assume he wasn't. Films like Alien 3 (which ironically was another sequel based on a Cameron directed gem) tossed the previous film's ideas aside and did nothing new or interesting with the story and characters. Terminator 3 sadly treads the same ground, except we've got a poor film score and cinematography to boot.<br/><br/>The story in synopsis reads like T2 revisited. An advanced terminator (Kristanna Loken) is sent back in time to destroy John Conner. Arnold Schwarzenegger, now an obsolete design, is again reprogrammed and sent back to protect him. The problem with this setup is that the first half of the film plays out without any dramatic tension. Loken does ok, but she's following Patrick as the T-1000 and Arnold as the T-800. She's about as menacing as a killer barbie doll. Hamilton felt more like a terminator in T2 than Loken does here. We know Conner isn't in danger for at least 3/4 the film, we know Arnold isn't in danger for at least 3/4 the film, etc.<br/><br/>If the first act added to the characterization of the lead roles, this at least could have been put up with. As it stands, it's another cog in the bland, loud, effects wheel this summer. Is the now oft talked about crane street chase impressive? Well yeah, they spent probably 20 million dollars on it. It should look cool. But I felt no fear, no tension, nothing. Jonathan Mostow seems to have no concept of dramatic pacing here, and action for the sake of action doesn't cut it. Mostow also frames everything so blandly. Maybe its due to the complexity of the effects they need to add in post-production, but I could frame scenes like these. Framing would have helped add texture to the film, but his inferior John Ford routine doesn't work. You find yourself longing for Cameron and Alan Greenberg cinematic eye only a few minutes into the film.<br/><br/>
The film does wrap up with an interesting twist, but it unfortunately throws out everything Cameron preached for the first two films.<br/><br/>The death of the concept of ""No fate but what we make"" was the biggest disaster in the film. Adding insult to injury, the way it happens is completely impossible, and ultimately a bit laughable.<br/><br/>Speaking of laughable, I couldn't help but wander if Mostow thought he was making Bad Boys 2 or Con Air at times. Sometimes the graphic violence was bookended with rather stupid jokes. T2 had a few shots at levity, but this new film seems to have no concept of violence = consequences. The Terminator series always had this theme running underneath, and it was ultimately discarded with the rest of Cameron's ideas.<br/><br/>In the end I could on about things like military command bases looking like Dr. Evil's lair. Or  security letting Arnold and the kids walk into the most secret Air Force facility on the face of the planet, loaded with ammo and guns. Or why is the TX less advanced that the T1000? The T1000 was indestructible except by melting. The TX went down easy. She has a metal skeleton inside that can be broken. This is progress? Or how can ""taking control"" of the computer chips of a Ford Crown Victoria cop car suddenly give it the ability to drive itself? The onboard computer in a car doesn't press the gas peddle for us does it? Is this Terminator meets Trucks meets Duel? Etc. But that just begins endless nitpicking.<br/><br/>The point is the filmed is flawed on basic levels, and like the 3rd and 4th Alien films, should be wiped from the Terminator mythos. As a summertime action flick, it would be a 7 out of 10. As a terminator film, its a zero...and a sad footnote to one of my favorite film series..."

","Hey, he said he'd be baaahck. And so he is. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in `Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.' And even though it's, well, not a titanic effort from James Cameron, it's a well-directed rock-'em sock-'em action piece directed by Jonathan Mostow (`U-571').<br/><br/>This installment fits in quite well with the other two, and gives humorous nods to its predecessors along the way. It's set a decade after `Terminator 2' and is narrated by John Connor (Nick Stahl), who lives anonymously on the road, drifting from job to job as he tries to avoid the destiny his late mother, Sarah Connor, told him he faced, even though the two of them supposedly saved the world from a future in which machines tried to take over in a war with humankind. He has good reason to worry. A Terminatrix, a T-X (Kristanna Loken), appears in Beverly Hills to begin searching for Connor and also for Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), a veterinarian answering a late-night emergency call. Kate finds John in her office, and ends up locking him in a cage while she tries to tend a sick cat.  But the late-model, nearly indestructible Terminatrix isn't the only visitor from the future. Hot on her heels it eh T-101 (Schwarzenegger), an older, more fragile model that's been sent to ensure that John and Kate survive.<br/><br/>The chase/action sequences are outstanding -- if you're looking forward to a chase scene involving a crane that Schwarzenneger funded himself, you won't be disappointed. The character development is fun to watch, and, let's face it, here's Schwarzenegger again in the very role he was destined to play. Yes, he's no spring chicken, but he doesn't need to be -- he still looks great as the machine that's driven to complete its mission. There are a couple of great scenes involving sunglasses, two nods to the `I'll be baaahck' catchphrase, and more humor as the bewildered Kate begins to realize that this John Connor guy, with all his tales about robots and wars between people and machines, isn't completely insane.<br/><br/>There's plenty of R-rated action, too, amidst tons of violence, explosions and gore.  And yes, it sets the stage for a fourth installment. If that's what the future holds, I, for one, will be baaahck."

As expected, the tight framing and loss of focus in particularly quick shots and blue tint that are commonplace in Cameron films were not here.  But that's just a stylistic complaint.  Let's move on to what's really wrong with this film.<br/><br/>It is not entertaining or engaging.  You know the ending long before it has begun due to particular soliloquys.  The characters aren't interesting, particularly with the T-X, which did not even evoke a smidgen of fear or worry other than replicating Robert Patrick's T-1000.  The sequences play out like an average modern CGI action flick right off of the assembly line. There is no conflict, given that the previous concept of averting the future is negated by the new notion that nothing can avert Judgment Day.  This just doesn't have the heart that made the previous films work.<br/><br/>But what really bugs Arnold fans here is that unlike the previous films of his that made you laugh because he said lines, now he has so many one liners that it becomes annoying instead of humorous.  The minute he puts on the star glasses in the opening, he immediately becomes a silly clown figure, which is bad for the character.  Pointless cameos don't help matters either. While the previous films knew how to film an action sequence, this film just plays out like a longform BMW commercial.  <br/><br/>Ultimately, it is a waste of time and money.  There is no reason for making this film other than a hefty paycheck.  It is a useless picture in that it completely negates the previous films, as well as itself.

The action here is non-stop from the get-go,and its worth the admission to the thrill ride of the summer. However,the character of John Connor(played by Nick Stahl)should have been a lot tougher against the lethal android,since he suppose to be the leader of the resistance and here he is acting like a pure punk here and he should have kick ass. Come on,Linda Hamliton in the first two movies really kicked butt!!! But in all pure escapism and the female android is very menacing here who is finishing off the human race. And as for Arnold,he looks like the punk fashion of yore from the golden age of the 80's,than the future governor of California,and also for a change he is really showing his age too,but that doesn't stop him from taking out the baddies.

Claire Danes isn't given much to do, and the T-X is both beautiful and deadly.

","the third installment of the terminator series lacks the proper atmosphere of the first two, which were very entertaining. The whole idea of terminator is about confronting reality, even if it is uncomfortable, and T-3 skirts around the rough stuff way too much for serious fans of the terminator movies (of which I am one). Whereas arnold had a lack of attitude which gave an inherent comic element to the character, the script and story in T-3 personify him too much, and you may feel angered when he makes the terminator character into an emotionally guided human. The Terminator movies have all had some exploration of human relations (lovers in the first, mother-son in the second, and acquaintances in the third) but because of the lack of a real connection between the human characters involved in T-3, the viewer is forced to depend on the action more and more. This isn't that great since the director has decided to leave out a final confrontation, and the ""climax"", if you could call it that, to this action film is lacking in action. T-3 is a great disappointment for all fans of the terminator series, and all people looking to get a feel for the terminator series. My advice would be that, despite the energetic start, you skip this movie all together and concentrate on enjoying the original terminators, which had individual tones and experiences to offer."

","With James Cameron's refusal to participate (is he going to work again?), and two of the lead actors bowing out as well, there was every reason to believe that this third entry was nothing more than a weak and derivative attempt to wring money out of a once-bright franchise.  Let's face it; Arnold's instincts haven't been netting him gold lately.  The dismal pre-release buzz didn't help its reputation either.  So imagine my surprise when this actually turned out to be a pretty nifty sci-fi action thriller.<br/><br/>Is it a great film?  No; certainly not in a league with the first two films, which are now icons in the history of blockbusters.  There are two real problems holding this one back.<br/><br/>First, there's Kristanna Loken.  I'll be the first to admit that I could sit in a theater and look at her all day.  However, that's not the point of the character, is it?  When it comes to sheer intimidation and menacing presence, she is no Schwarzenegger, and she is certainly no Robert Patrick (in my opinion, the definitive Terminator).  While I didn't find her unbelievable, neither did I find her frightening.  And that's a problem.<br/><br/>The second stumbling block lies with the score.  For any discerning fan of the Terminator series, Brad Fiedel's score is the soul of the films. Without his innovative work, it feels as if the voice of the terminators and judgment day is gone.  Had he been replaced by someone like Jerry Goldsmith, the hole might have been filled.  But Marco Beltrami's score is merely adequate.  It hits its marks, and nothing more.  The action cues are rudimentary, and the rest is simply dull.  And the orchestral reworking of Fiedel's Terminator theme over the end credits is downright unwelcome.<br/><br/>The bright points, however, are many.  While the film starts out with a bit of a ""been there, done that"" vibe, it builds very successfully.  Each successive minute is better than the last.  The basic premise set up at the beginning simply has to be forgiven and gotten past.  After all, if the future machines can send back Terminator after Terminator, why send each one back to a later point than the one before?  Why not go back earlier, or send them all back to same point to pool their efforts?  The movie isn't interested in answering these logic flaws, but fortunately finds more fertile ground in the characters.  This movie's greatest strength lies in the fact that it is not a movie about the Terminator, but about John Connor. The Terminator is merely an element that serves to delineate Connor as a character, and illustrate his struggle with what appears to be his fate.<br/><br/>Which brings me to something I greatly admire here.  Cameron's films existed to illustrate the idea that the future is not written.  The mantra of ""no fate but what we make"" is repeated to make the point that the actions of the individual matter; an interesting point in a movie about nuclear war and the annhilation of the human race.  Well, this film will have none of that. It bravely reverses the stance of Cameron's stories, creating a starker, more realist view of the Terminator universe, in which common people can have no effect on events that shake the world.  It's a dreary philosophy, but it rings truer than Cameron's warm fuzzy approach.<br/><br/>The action here is first-rate, and wisely continues Cameron's tradition of unorthodox chase sequences.  Why use fast cars when you can employ a crane truck and beat-up pickup?  The Terminator fights bring more of a superheroic element, and the use of CGI stand-ins is first-rate (the Wachowskis should be forced to watch these sequences repeatedly); they are used sparingly, and we are never allowed to see them long enough to give away the artifice.<br/><br/>Another surprise is how quickly and easily Nick Stahl falls into the role of John Connor.  Perhaps it helps that the character was a young teen when last we saw him.  Stahl builds an adult who could reasonably have developed from Edward Furlong's teenager, and the references to the previous film manage to roll believably from the character.<br/><br/>Warning: this might be considered a spoiler.  The ending cements the stark attitude of the film, demonstrating the inevitability of Connor's fate. It also provides the setup for the story that Terminator fans have been wanting to see all along, and that Cameron most likely would never have done.  The final lines provide the perfect pinch of hope set amongst the apocalyptic imagery, and actually leave you hoping for one more sequel."

","sequel season 2003 continues, this time for a movie that was made 10 years ago. the plot remains the same: two 'terminator'-class machines are sent back from the future to the present time. one of them is sent to assassinate, and the other to protect. the targetted individuals again are unaware or do not accept their future importance, and the humor is on the same lines, including a reference to the famous Hasta La Vista from Terminator 2. As expected, the main attractions in this movie are the computer generated effects and the beautiful actresses (this time around the machine-sent terminator takes the form of the sexy Kristanna Loken). Nothing is surprising in this film, it takes the exact same things that made the first 2 movies a hit and jumbles them all back together into this bland product.

For staters i think this is quite possible the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to watch...and before you all go off on one, its NOT because James Cameron didnt direct it. The film itself should never have been made to begin with, T1 was a fantastic movie when it was first released(and yes i am old enough to remember) it took the movie world by storm..a fresh original idea with arnie playing a hardcore cyborg that really didnt take no for a answer...he was ruthless and mean.<br/><br/>T2 was also a very good movie for different reasons...the special effects were mindblowing...and story if somewhat far fetched was still plauseble from the first one....this time arnie wasnt a hardcore mindless killing machine, but they injected a bit of compassion and humour into him. In my opinion they really shouldnt have done that..but still they pulled it off quite well.<br/><br/>T3....well what can i say...first it is a lame attempt to restore a flagging career of one of hollywoods greatest hardmen....from The moment he put those cheesy shades on when he walked out of the club, i knew it was going to be bad. Ruining a once decent franchise by blatently taking the mick out of it. The actor who played john connor (i dont know his name and really cant be bothered to look for it) has no acting skills at all..at best his performance was rubbish, the same goes for his female co star. The humour was appaling, the acting was diabolicle and the story line was pathetic. One moment the terminator was saying ""john connor must live, he leads the humans to ultimate victory"" the next moment he his saying ""it is inevitable that all humans die"" make your bloody mind up..he either leads them to victory or he doesnt. The film wasnt without its good moments though...in my opinion the best moments in the film were the last 30seconds before the credits rolled up. This film just didnt have the tension and gripping moments like the other 2 had, the chase scene involving the crane was ok...but still it was no different to any other car chase scene ever made. Plus various other parts of this movie were just blatently ripped straight out of the other 2 movies.<br/><br/>I give this movie 0.5 out of 10....ive seen better robocop sequels..and thats saying something!"

I know it'll do this efficiently.<br/><br/>But after the James Cameron directed T1 and T2, this was just a pale shadow of its former self.

Also T1 and T2 had some ideas and good dialogue to offer up together with those great action scenes which complemented the plot. This had a dumbed-down dialogue and the ideas-free plot - such as it was - was just there to move us from one lackluster action scene to the next.<br/><br/>To compare it to a couple of not dissimilar contemporary movies:<br/><br/>I've seen some reports that put the crane chase scene up there with the highway chase scene in `The Matrix Reloaded'.

There are no more angles to approach, unless you introduce yet another new Terminator that is faster and more powerful than the original. Hopefully, Arnold will be worrying more about politics than another Terminator sequel because we simply don't need one.

"Rovin","7","0","0","9 July 2003"," A well made big budget B movie that could have been much worse.
","If Cameron can do a sequel to Alien then why can't someone do a sequel to his baby?  Overall it was a well made big budget B movie with a few surprises and more skill than I would have expected. The action sequences were quite good--especially the first chase. No, the T X was not as memorable as the T-1000--but give her credit for trying. She really could take abuse while holding the same expression. <br/><br/>
 Granted, I did miss Cameron's epic blue steel ""look"" and Brad Fiedel's music. The first Terminator was a decent low budget eighties thriller(the only flaw for me was that they cooked up the ludicrous notion that only organic tissue could time travel--which neither T2 or T3 held to). On the other hand, T2 was never what it could have been. It had the advantage of introducing computer graphics in a big action film--but its heavy handed social commentary (the children playing with guns sequence, the closing narration etc.) and often goofy out of character dialogue(""I need a vacation"") made my eyes roll . Cameron decided to make a nicer, friendlier terminator who discovers human emotions. Noble effort but I do not think he pulled it off. He also wanted us to believe that some good ol boy computer specialist is going to throw away his career and civilian life just because a kid, a crazy militia woman, and some guy with a mechanical arm shows up. And I cannot forgive him for missing the most obvious closing action sequence by not having a stripped down stop motion animated endoskeleton duking it out with the computer generated  liquid metal shapeshifter in the steel mill. That would have been a spectacular sequence and probably made the final terminator-father moments less hokey than they appeared.<br/><br/>
Anyway--back to T3<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING<br/><br/>
Arnold's Terminator: I thought he was less jokey than in T-2, and closer to a machine. And its fair to say that this Terminator actually succeeded (or will succeed) in completing its mission(ironically, including those of the first Terminator and the T-1000). As in T2--there were times when he came across as too human in his responses (though the first sequel did establish he was reprogrammed to adapt).  Also the conflicted cyborg/car smashing sequence was too much.<br/><br/>Story-wise, the screenwriters evidently tried to put something into the story. The ending was brave--especially given the current international climate and new nuke technologies being discussed.<br/><br/>
Overall it could have been much worse given hollywood's record of late, though another sequel would really be stretching it."

I asked my self that they better come up with a good script, I thought the last pieces of evidence destroyed in T2? isn't Arnold too old and out of shape for the role? I was not dissapointed. Arnold was as jacked as ever, this is his definitive role and what he's known for and is as good as he was in T2, however he was the best in the original. Writing was excellent. The dialogue was ok, except for the many comedy lines which were uncalled for. <br/><br/>     The action never let's up until the greatest old school action  chase scene ends. Yes i did see Matrix reloaded but it was too cartoonish, I hate when movies overuse Cgi, nothing has the feel of ""real"" car models and ""real"" stunts. I did not move to the edge of my seat until midway point. Critics keep bashing the movie because it set up for a potential T4. Who cares? why not make another movie if you can write a good screenplay like this. It's not possible to dislike great writing unless you like hating on good things. <br/><br/>     The acting was superb. Nick Stahl surprised me, did a good job of making you beleive he is an older Ed Furlong. Clare Danes was impressive and basically played a similar role as Linda Hamilton did with Sara Connor. Newcomer Kristanna Loken also did a good job of recreating Patrick's T-1000 role. She wasn't as advanced, she has a metal skeleton but is full of gadgets. I guess the machines realized since the T-1000 failed, they decided to send back a T-X. Why do the humans keep sending old model primitive T-101's to protect Connor? I guess it's because he can relate to humans the most, I guess he is like a machine with a soul. <br/><br/>      This movie had to be made. I know Terminator fans would love to see how the machines first start taking over humanity and T3 Rise of the machines keeps the prestige and greatness of the Terminator franchise.

He made the T1000 go inside out, spill out from holes is stuff, etc. Forget about the one liners already. Those don't totally ruin a film. Neither does the opinion that Edward Furlong was whiney.

Edward Furlong may be an exception to some but, I dunno, I bought the DVD and I never thought he was whiney. How the hell is a kid being chased by a f-ing liquid metal Terminator with ammo flying everywhere supposed to act? And who cares anyways. Morton and Hamilton were brilliant.<br/><br/>T3. I'll give it only one thing: nice action scenes. Even nicer than T2. The concept of what the TX is is a little bit ridiculous, but whatever. Kristanna Loken looks so damn hot. I love her. Beautiful outfit as well. The quality of the CG isn't really that bad as one review said it was. Otherwise the movie is pretty crappy. Within 10 minutes of the film I was p***ed. What happend to the metal logo intro? None of that at all. What happened to the kick ass Terminator music? Only at the end credits. Tradition and consistancy give the franchise identity and they're nice touches, although if I was a director I'd put more importance on that. One thing that p***ed me off was that Mostow doesn't even know how to film scenes properly. Some scenes don't look right and he uses slow motion in some pointless places. If you thought T2's one liners were stupid then wtf is with ""talk to the hand"". That is the single most stupidest thing I can think of for a Terminator to say. And what's with Arnold acting like a moron. That whole ""TX has infected my system"" bit is pretty lame. The way Arnold stuggles with the virus in him was pretty clicheic and lame. What the hell is the scene with him banging a car with his hands in the hanger scene? And since when does restarting your system get rid of a virus? And when he put his own head back on... gimme a break. He looked pretty f-ing dead to me when the TX practically busted his head off with connections severed and all. The whole thing seemed pretty stupid. Mostow can't even get his facts straight. It clearly shows in T2 that Connor was 10 not 13 when the Terminator first encountered him. And the T-101 says he's supposed to kill Connor and that he'll be back. How is that possible when he blew himself up with the TX? oh, you mean another model 101? or what? There's inconsistencies and stupidity everywhere. At one point Connor mentions has enough fire power to blow up 10 super computers. Really? All 10 of them? Wow! The cameo appearance of Dr. Silberman was stupid. What's he even doing there? When he sees the Terminator he just runs away. Oh-kay.... and the fumbling for the keys cliche.<br/><br/>BAD: The script is bad. The acting isn't particularly good. Filmed poorly. The T-101 says and does some stupid things.

There are past characters from both films that you long for.  In both cases, the third installment doesn't measure up critically with its other two chapters but, nevertheless, you're glad it was made.  <br/><br/>'Terminator III' has several things going for it.  Nick Stahl has far more appeal and better acting ability than the whiney and annoying Edward Furlong.  The computer effects look better than ever and the resolution of this third film stirs up debate better than ever about fate vs. choice and which one decides the future.  Arnold has lost a lot of edge since the original film in 1984 but he has some good lines, still looks physically convincing in the role and the biggest surprise of all for me was Claire Danes.  I thought her role would be written in as an unnecessary replacement for the absent Linda Hamilton but we see that her character is important to the fate of the future. <br/><br/>Director Jonathan Mostow is no James Cameron but he has a strong industrial vision for action, keeps every second of this movie interesting and likens its running time closer to the first film than the second and this is a plus because there are parts of 'T2' that really dragged for me and half an hour could have been chopped off its original theatrical release.  'T3' is more tight than the second film.  It's open for a fourth film and I recommend it because it JUST FEELS RIGHT!"

And it is a shame that Nick Stahl has to play a wimp for such a large part of the movie. This is not how I remembered John Connor from T2, and Nick does not get much chance to show he can play a tough guy too.

","Modern filmmakers often try to create cinematic events which work on multiple levels. However, in order for a movie to be good, it must first succeed on a superficial level. This is where Matrix Reloaded failed. Reloaded, at its most profound, tried to engage the viewers in philosophical debate. But on the surface, Reloaded was nothing more than MTV style and sensibilities. Ultimately, Reloaded can be summed up in one word: Techno. Perhaps, that's slightly unfair, but it's less unfair than writing The Crow off as a goth movie. But enough about OTHER movies.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 is a movie that does work on that basic level. It's absolutely entertaining to watch. The action scenes are more thrilling than anything that Hollywood has offered up so far in 2003. The plot is decent too. Even without James Cameron, the T3 managed to make a decent movie. Cameron has described T3 as ""great"", so the movie is clearly not an affront to the first two movies. If you liked Arnold in T2, you'll like him in T3. The reprogrammed, slightly outdated T-101 is as good as ever. Nick Stahl gives a good performances as the paranoid disillusioned 20-something junkie John Connor. Claire Danes also does well as Kate Brewster, a veterinarian thrown into a situation that's out of her control. Kristanna Loken does as well as she can with the T-X role. T-X isn't anywhere near as ruthless as Robert Patrick's T-1000, but she's far more effective at keeping her targets in her sites.<br/><br/>Some people have said there's too much humor in T3. I disagree. Every action movie has its fair share of levity. The epic T2 had John Connor teaching the Terminator to say thinsg like ""eat me, d***wad"" as well explaining to him that he couldn't just kill people.<br/><br/>Another complaint is that the plot is too thin. I disagree wholeheartedly with this. Director Johnathan Mostow and the writers don't beat you over the head with the motivation of the characters, they leave some of that open to you. Not every movie is gonna hold your hand and walk you step by step through a detailed explanation of things. Some things you just need to accept, or interpret for yourself. After all, this IS science fiction/action. However, there is one mind boggling scene where the T-X inexplicably escapes from a magnetic field. This is the only major flaw with the movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps the one main drawback to T3 is that if you haven't seen the prequels, especially T2, then you may not understand some of the finer points of the movie. But if you haven't seen T2, you have no business watching any sci-fi/action movies anyway.<br/><br/>T3 has a great ending, but they inevitably leave it open for another sequel. I really hope there isn't a T4. No series has ever passed the 3 movie and remained great or even good.<br/><br/>T3 will never be as good as T2, but it's a valiant effort. I've tried not to talk too much about the plot; that's not the purpose of a review. If you want to know why the events in T2 didn't prevent Judgment Day, you'll have to go see T3 for yourself.I'm not here to ruin the movie. If you're a fan of Arnold, Terminator, or action movies, go see T3. It's a whole lot of fun and action from start to finish. And it fits seamlessly into the series progression.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 3.5 out of 4 stars"

","Not a great movie.  About 1/2 is pretty good (the basic concept created by James Cameron), but the film goes way down hill quickly once the plot gets going.  Repeats things from the first movies and PLOT HOLES GALORE!<br/><br/><br/><br/>(Spoilers)<br/><br/>I can suspend my disbelief that we have a science fiction movie here, but come on... unbelievably advanced autonomous cybernetic organisms by the year 2030?  Impossible for me to believe since we can't even get a robot to climb stairs, pick up a glass or recognize and interpret speech in 2003.  In the opinions of most robotic scientists, we're at least a century away from a thinking, autonomous robot.  So the dates in this movie are waaaaay off, I think.  I won't even get into time travel (necessary for the story) that many think great thinkings believe is several millenia away, if not impossible.<br/><br/>But those aren't my problems.  I suspended my disbelief to accept time travel and the Terminator machines coming from 30 years in the future.<br/><br/>1. How does Skynet take over?  No computer software on Earth is linked to every other piece of software.  They speak different computer languages. This is so laughable as to discredit the entire Terminator franchise. Furthermore, human beings launch nuclear missles (requires synchronized key turns, code keys and non-automated button pressing).  It's done by humans, not a computer.  Ridiculous.  It is patently IMPOSSIBLE for a rouge computer virus to even take over a satellite/cellular network, much less a missle silo.  The only thing it could do is give the President the illusion that Russian missles were on the way, so he would order his generals to launch the counter-attack.<br/><br/>2. I'm sick of military ""Command Centers"" looking like they do in movies - like Dr. Evil's lair.  We're to believe that they're flying a jet/rocket powered test vehicle 20 feet away from the SkyNet computer banks, INDOORS! Has anyone ever seen documentary footage of testing?  It's done outside hangars and grey concrete buildings in the desert. I'll bet anyone a million dollars that the Air Force doesn't operate a single room on the Earth that looks remotely like the ""Command Center"" in T3.  And they happen to have all their battle robots, hover drones, particle accelerator and SkyNet computers in one place?  SURE.  Did the screenwriters ever talk to anyone who was ever in the military?  Los Alamos Labs don't look like dat.<br/><br/>3. What kind of security lets Arnold and the 2 kids into the most secret Air Force facility on the face of the planet, loaded to the gills with ammo and guns?  Huh?<br/><br/>4. Why do the machines keep sending 1 Terminator?  Why not 10?  They keep screwing up.  Why not ensure things?  Why not build a Terminator suicide bomber?  Why not just throw your power cell at John Conner when you get within a mile of him?  Is SkyNet incompetent?<br/><br/>5. Why is the TX less advanced that the T1000?  The T1000 was indescructable except by melting.  The TX went down in an explosion.  She has a metal skeleton inside that can be broken.  This is progress?<br/><br/>6. Why did the missle shoot through the office window and not kill anyone? Why can people be thrown repeatedly onto cement floors without breaking ribs or limbs?<br/><br/>7. Where was everyone at the old nuclear fallout facility?  Why did it have power?  Where were all the soldiers at the new command center?  Shouldn't they be guarding the place?<br/><br/>8. If Arnold took out his 2nd and last power cell, how did he manage to move his body and arm to stick it in the TX's mouth?  Wouldn't he be absent a power sourace the instant he unhooked his final power cell?  My digital camera ceases to take pictures if I remove its battery.<br/><br/>9. Why did they take off in a Cessna 172, yet fly inside a DeHavilland? Totally different planes.<br/><br/>10. How can ""taking control"" of the computer chips of a Ford Crown Victoria cop car suddenly give it the ability to move its own steering wheel and press its own brakes?  Absolutely idiotic.<br/><br/>11. How many bullets can fly, explosions demolish things and cars disintegrate without loss of life?  I guess the director drew inspiration from the A-Team.  Violence has no consequence.<br/><br/>12. Are we to believe that on a planet with 6 billion people that simpletons like John Conner, his buddy at the Carl's Jr. drive-thru and a vet assistant will become the last hope of the Earth?  Stretches believability to the max.<br/><br/>13. Why can the T101 perfectly replicate voice and speech patterns of others, but speaks with a thick Austrian accent in default mode?  (I'm just being a smart aleck now.)<br/><br/>The more I think about this movie, the more I realize how much it blows. This movie is absurd science fiction but doesn't play it for fun like Men In Black or Ghostbusters.  It plays things straight and that's why it is no good for anyone with a brain.  More than stupid science fiction, it just doesn't make any sense, plotwise.<br/><br/>Skip it in the theater but catch it on video.  About as good as Alien 3, which was also a franchise that dropped Cameron when they got to part 3!"

"Eccentric Brit","8","0","0","8 July 2003"," Very good movie which almost lives up to its predecessors
","Despite the views of some critics, I found this movie to be a solid piece of entertainment. Following on the heels of the 1984 sci-fi action classic ""The Terminator"" and its sequel ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", the plot once again centres around an attempt by machines from the future to eliminate John Connor, the man destined to become the saviour of humankind.<br/><br/>Still afraid for his life, John now lives ""off the grid"" with no phone or known address to avoid being traced. One can understand his reasons, since a shapeshifting liquid metal cyborg (in the guise of T2's Robert Patrick) tried to kill him when he was still a child. Despite that the foretold nuclear war on August 29, 1997 (see the earlier flicks) failed to materialise, John still suspects all has not been set right. His fears are justified when another cyborg assassin, the T-X who assumes the form of a 5' 11'' blonde female, is sent back to eliminate his unsuspecting lieutenants (initially at least) on the eve of the postponed -- not averted -- nuclear war in the hope of changing the outcome of the future war between humans and sentient machines bent on their destruction. Once again, the resistance sends back another terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger, who else?) to protect John from the more advanced model. Why not send back a T-1000 or T-X instead? Well, I suppose capturing a liquid man (or woman) alive would be somewhat difficult, so it kinda makes sense.<br/><br/>There are many absentees from the earlier movies, notably Linda Hamilton (John's mother Sarah in T1 and T2), Edward Furlong (John in T2) and not least the writer/director John Cameron. This time, the director is Johnathan Mostow, whose previous credits include Breakdown and U-571. However, I feel the director brought a new feel to the movie and all worked out quite well.<br/><br/>Newcomers Nick Stahl and Claire Danes (who plays Katherine Brewster, one of John's future lieutenants) aquit themselves quite well and have good on-screen chemistry. Kristanna Loken (the supermodel turned actress who plays the T-X) is very convincing and has the same icy look that Robert Patrick had in T2. Arnold is getting a bit old for this type of movie now, but he still has the screen presence needed to liven things up.<br/><br/>The movie is generally more light hearted than its two predecessors, though there is the odd dark scene mixed in. There are plenty of gags, some of which are effective and some which don't quite work. The T-X's abilities are interesting. Without giving too much away, she is somewhat a hybrid of the T-101 and T-1000, a metal endoskelton with advanced weapons surrounding by liquid metal, able to assume the forms of other people and control other machines (which leads to some interesting situations).<br/><br/>T3 is entertaining throughout. Most of the movie is spent with the T-X chasing the heroes (and heroine), kind of similar to T1, but without the prolonged story-driven sections in the middle of T2. There are some very good action sequences, notably a chase seen early on, although I feel they could have made the movie a little longer (perhaps just over two hours) with a more climatic fight between the T-101 and T-X. Despite a good earlier fight scene, she is despatched a little too easily at the end, considering she is supposed to be an anti-terminator terminatrix (according to the T-101 anyway). The fight between the T-101 and T-1000 in the steel mill at the end of T2 was superior, as was the battle between Sarah and the T-101 in the Cyberdyne factory in the original. Also, there are sections where they don't really use the T-X as well as they could have. I think some of the gory sections (which would have made her a more scary character and on a par with Robert Patrick) were cut. For instance, she threatens a cop but we don't actually see him die. There's also a scene where she saws somebody up but we only see the splattering blood.<br/><br/>All in all, an entertaining summer blockbuster (not quite as good as X2 but better than the Matrix Reloaded) and a worthy follow up, though not as groundbreaking as the previous two films.<br/><br/>Eccentric Brit rates it 8/10 (T1 and T2 both 9/10)"

","NOTE: CONTAINS UNQUESTIONABLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Oh, yeah!  This movie is a perfect prequel to what can be an even more terrifying, intense, Orwellian and Fritz Langian T4 that can totally eclipse the first three.  If I were writing the screenplay, this would be my opening:<br/><br/>The missiles are flying, the nuclear warheads detonating.  Every single bit of the horror we baby-boomers tried so hard to prevent in reality and to capture in nightmare fiction and film during the Cold War in ""Level Seven,"" ""Fail-Safe,"" ""On the Beach,"" and ""Seven Days in May"" finally comes home to roost.  But it's not the Soviets or the Red Chinese or even terrorists with black-market nuclear weapons who are responsible: It's our own creation, born from our fear and hubris - SkyNet.<br/><br/>Scenes of people of every nation being vaporized in the middle of their day and night work and play activities around the globe are accompanied by the dark, apocalyptic chords and lyrics of ""House at Pooneil Corners"" by Jefferson Airplane (remember that one, fellow baby-boomers?)<br/><br/>Gracie Slick sings as a SkyNet craft...<br/><br/>""Circles...like a vulture.""<br/><br/>After a few short minutes of mind-bending horror that make us wish we had never invented atomic bombs or computers or even been born - instantly making us all almost Luddites - we find ourselves in a creepily silent post-apocalyptic world as only Industrial Light and Magic can portray them. It is possible to even tie this vision of hell in with technology we ""successfully"" harvested, retroengineered, and exploited from Roswell in 1947, but which we - the true sorceror's apprentices - never, ever completely understood.<br/><br/>Scene upon scene of devastation assault us as the opening credits roll - we wish we had never started watching T4 but now we can't look away - and Marty Balin's angelic voice rises...<br/><br/>""From here to heaven is a scar, Dead center, deep as death..."" ...and Gracie Slick's voice joins his...<br/><br/>""All the idiots have left..."" ...followed by the whole band...<br/><br/>""...the idiots have left. Cows are almost cooing, Turtle doves are mooing, Which is why...""<br/><br/>The music starts to fade, and we are there.<br/><br/>""...a Pooh is poohing In the sun...""<br/><br/>Somehow, a stuffed Pooh Bear lies unharmed next to his dead child in a sunny yard (a ""clean"" neutron bomb might accomplish that trick).<br/><br/>John Connor and Kate Brewster will emerge as our leaders in the counter-revolution, though neither ever wanted or bargained for it.  (But neither did Winston Churchill, in the years between WWI and WWII.)<br/><br/>
So will Sarah Connor.  Nope, she ain't really dead, folks.  She faked her death (why do you suppose her coffin was filled with guns and ammo that her son could easily procure anyhere instead of either her body or sandbags except as a message to her son if he's clever enough to figure it out after the dust settles - maybe Arnie knew about the ruse - we now know he can lie - and maybe not). Those two  are humanity's only hope, there in the depths of Crystal Mountain (except possibly for Sarah, who I'd have underground in Mexico), with obsolete computers that have never been linked to SkyNet because they were created in the days before the DARPANet and the Internet were even thought of.  They're slow, and they are programmed in almost archaic languages such as Fortran.  But they work, and they are uninfected.<br/><br/>This is a screenwriter's dream.<br/><br/>Bring it on!"

"erikgloor","7","0","0","7 July 2003"," Not nearly as satisfying as T2, but pretty fun
","John Connor is shown in a flash-forward in the beginning of 'T3,' not just as triumphant, but triumphant with an American flag draped over his shoulder. An American man saves the world from the small-minded machines. And so begins the sometimes not-so-subtle love song to the American man, that 'T3' so often is. A love song sung in broken English, and with a German accent.<br/><br/>Nothing that Hollywood puts this much energy and money ino can ever be dismissed as just an action picture.<br/><br/>A film student could probably do a pretty decent dissertation on the differences in directing styles by comparing 'T2' and 'T3' as two films that are as similar as two films can get in terms of subject-matter, but which differ so noticeably in tone and subtext.<br/><br/>The cold, dark blue world of T2 was full of sophisticated foreboding and it couched it's fantastic effects and spectacular violence in some interesting meditations on the concepts of Generation X and of the passage of time. Arnold was older, but still the picture of vitality and robotic perfection. There was some poetry to the picture.<br/><br/>The present effort is not devoid of these elements, but comes precipitously close on a number of different levels.<br/><br/>For those of us who were 16 when the original 'Terminator' came out, watching 'T2' was like watching your idiot friend get a date with his sexy first-year college professor. Someone big decided to take this slightly moronic but highly entertaining concept seriously and make a silk purse out of it and it was great. 'T3' is kind of like what it'd be like if that friend came around again after marrying the professor and tried hard to remember what it was like to be down with his boys way back when. You want it to be the same, but it just isn't. It's an exercise in sentimentality mostly.<br/><br/>But what we don't get in terms of depth and scope, we get in terms of Arnold's personal vision of masculinity. I mean, let's face it, everybody knows the 'Terminator' movies are for boys -- the girls have 'Sex in the City.' Arnold's commentary on the state of the American male ego is subtle, but if you watch for it, it becomes very clear.<br/><br/>Firstly, I was highly suspect of the newcomer bad-guy, or gal, in this case. From press pictures, she didn't seem scary at all -- or even mechanical in any way. I thought the angular dimensions and sheer size of someone like Brigitte Nielsen, in her heyday, would have been far more adequate a choice. But I have to say Kristanna Loken won me over early. Soft and supple, but somehow menacing in her sheer determination, I don't think it's an accident a pretty young German woman wound up opposite my favorite Austrian killer robot. And I doubt it was an accident she comes dressed in the guise of a leather-clad, Lexus-driving material girl who pumps up her breast-size to get out of trouble.<br/><br/>Further, the scene in which Arnold and Kristanna square off in a men's room is very nearly worth the price of admission. Not simply a dance of destruction, but subtly, a contest of dominance and submission. Indeed, Arnold works his old-fashioned German values into this film probably more than any other I've seen. Arnold's robot makes value judgments this time around and says things like ""Maybe you're not the John Connor I know."" I doubt it took more than a couple of Nazi movies for Schwarzenegger to feel it was his duty to rehabilitate the sensibilities of his grandparents to the typical American if he ever got the opportunity. One must wonder how much he is appealing the current, non-threatening (think Tom Hanks) consensus of movie manhood, when his character says things like ""I am an obsolete design"" and ""she is a healthy female of breeding age."" Finally, *** SPOILER *** one can't help but read into the imagery of Arnold's robot pulling a grasping female robot off of the John Connor character and ramming his, Arnold's, heart (metaphorically) down her throat to finish her off. The young Connor escapes with his bride-to-be. This is a powerful image of male dominance that implies something of fatherhood and parental dynamics.<br/><br/>It's easy to debate these inferences, but it's important to remember that when Hollywood whispers, everyone hears.<br/><br/>I think old Arnold thinks the American male is a little embattled and a little down on himself and thinks we could take a lesson from our vanquished teutonic foes. Because this is the movie he'd make given that mindset.<br/><br/>Do we need this shot in the arm? Hey, I'M not gonna argue with him. It's Arnold!<br/><br/>This movie review by Erik Gloor"

","This movie rocks. Really rocks. I give it 8 out of 10 stars. It's almost as good as T2, lacking only the older movie's emotional depth. The special effects are cutting edge, the script intelligent and the acting good. They didn't go for an obvious, easy ending either. Loken is the best terminator ever. Sure there's some plot holes, but they aren't as big as those in the Matrix.<br/><br/>** MAJOR SPOILERS **<br/><br/>Some reviewers either don't understand the trilogy or haven't seen the earlier movies in the franchise.<br/><br/>First off, the ending is neither confusing nor does it suggest what led up to it was pointless. The ending fulfills the title: the war with the machines has begun. The goal of the evil terminators was to kill off mankind's hero in the coming war, and the protectors were to save him. The protectors won. That's not a bad ending. Arnold tells us early in the movie what the outcome will be.. It seems you cannot rewrite the future after all, contrary to what our hero has believed up til now. (Stephen Hawking is working on a theory that will show you cannot go back in time and make substantive changes in the future).<br/><br/>Arnold can't go forward in time to get outfitted as a better terminator. One thing physics does reveal is that you cannot go forward in time. Another complaint was that the saw TX uses to free herself should have stuck to the magnets also. Not if it wasn't ferrous, so that scene is quite plausible. What we should be asking is why the ultra-advanced TX is made from ferrous materials at all.<br/><br/>Loken is better than Patrick as a terminator -- she shows less emotion and is more consistent. Not to  mention really hot. This movie was rated R -- why did they put that ugly wig over her breasts?<br/><br/>Arnold was more dead-pan in T2, and was a better robot in T2. But he's fun in his new style, and I liked his performance. He had fun with this movie. ALL the acting this movie was at least competent, and some of it quite good. In T2, John's foster dad puts out one of the worst acting performances I've seen -- ever. I still cringe when he speaks."

Apparently the director played it very safe with this flick. He copied James Cameron's structure of the movie and did a good job. It was very fun and I think Claire Danes was good choice, just because of the moment she picked up the gun fired at the flying craft(I wish there was more of that). Chirstina Loken did an amazing job and she was HOT in that suit. Arnie also does a good job, except some jokes could have been told differently to make them funnier. The guy who played John Connor also captured not wanting to be the one kinda situation very well and made the transition to a hero good. There were no apparent mistakes in the movie, the FX were made to look real (which was a good choice for this movie, unlike the stylized Matrix sfx.)

"dneal","6","0","0","7 July 2003"," Pure Action, Without Any Drive, Spirit or Thought Required
","I've seen it twice now and have been doing a lot of thinking about what I've observed. I've been trying to figure out what they've done to one of my favorite movie series of all time.<br/><br/>T1 was a Sci-Fi thriller with some action thrown in. It was about thought. They couldn't throw out hours of CGI action back in these days. It was up to your imagination to fill in the gaps. It left you wondering just what you were seeing and what was happening. Cameron didn't go out of his way to explain everything or to have explosions everywhere. It was about shadows, symbolism, and dreaming. It was awesome.<br/><br/>T2 was the action side of T1 but still with a razor sharp plot that left the viewer thinking hard about what he was seeing. It dealt with issues of humanity and the thought that our lives are not predetermined to work out a certain way. T2, as was T1, was a finely sculpted movie. The only improvement could have been leaving all the DVD's added footage in the theatrical release.<br/><br/>T3 is a new and very different monster. Cameron is gone, replaced by Mostow. Mostow created a movie with a different goal, and a very different feeling. The emphasis was plainly on the action with storyline and character development taking a backseat. There weren't really any major flaws with the small amount of story there was, and I liked how it continued T2's ""fate is what we make"" theme. But, this move just lacks the character and energy of Cameron's Terminator works.<br/><br/>For one, the humor was far too excessive. T-800s don't crack jokes. The ONLY reason Arnold did in T2 was because John taught them to him after they switched Arnold's chip to learn mode. A T-800 is a walking AI designed to efficiently and ruthlessly kill. They don't go out of their way to be funny. The worst part of the humor was most certainly the fact that it downplayed the seriousness of the film. The world is about to end, T-800s and T-Xs are trashing citys and gruesomely murdering people. Intertwining humor with this is ridiculous. They seemed to go out of their way to destroy the atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>One MAJOR peeve for me was the lack of a quality soundtrack. Music is a major part of this series, and a soundtrack easily makes or breaks a movie for me. Brad Fiedel's score for T1 and T2 are indisputably legendary and are easily 50% of what made the movies so great. They had an edge to them that fit with the whole evil machine theme, and created a simply stunning sonic atmosphere. His use of industrial sounds to create a moving, percussion-based sound was just incredibly creative.<br/><br/>This new Marco Beltrami fellow decided to take the Terminator his own direction. Too bad his direction is a muddy, unemotional mess. Perhaps he is a T-800, his music inspired the same level of emotion in me as the T-800 displays. Watching the city-block smashing scene without any influential background music was just completely illusion-breaking and dumbfounding. The theme for the T-X was uninspired and very weak. Arnold's hammer-banging heavy industrial theme from T2 was replaced with nothing as far as I could tell. The poor score made the movie feel like a halfway effort. The music lacked heart, and thus so did the visuals.<br/><br/>After seeing it a second time I've become sort of less critical, however. A sequel means changes, and I realize that. The new director did a decent job maintaining consistency with the Terminator plotline. He just couldn't knit together the atmosphere, story, emotion, and action that made the older two flicks such total classics.<br/><br/>A special message for Mostow: Bring back Brad Fiedel to score T4.<br/><br/>

","In the first and second Reese and Sarah Conner's intensity about the situation really made you care about what happened.  You were concerned whether John would live or not.whether they would stop SkyNet.  James Cameron's Grit also helped the atmosphere and made the world of the terminators a very dark and scary place.<br/><br/>This movie was a joke.  Mostowe replaced grit with levity.  Also you never got a sense of fear or importance about their situation.  In T2 when Arnold cuts his arm away to reveal his arm and then says `Now listen very carefully' you really get a sense of the dire severity of the problem in the movie.  In this Danes realizes Arnold is a terminator when she SHOOTS HIM IN THe HEAD and on top of that Arnold makes a Joke.  `Don't do that' he says. He should have lifted up his shirt to reveal the part he cut off.  Or even better cut some skin off some where like in T2.  There is a reason we need to care he is a terminator.

","I had enormous expectations from this movie, and from all the stars, but in the end, I was a bit disappointed. My first thoughts were, ""I think this movie misses James Cameron"". But, we have to be fair to Mostow. Who can stand up to a challenge as great as this - continuing the Terminator series, especially when T2 was such a big hit.<br/><br/>As expected, the special effects were unbelievable !! It's amazing what you can make pple think they're watching, these days. But I felt that the movie didn't have any direction. The chases just kept going on and on, and I didn't quite understand what was happening.<br/><br/>All the actors did pretty well. Arnold was excellent as usual, Claire Danes was made for that Kate Brewster role, and Stahl was not bad. Although it was a little strange to see a female Terminator (I'm not trying to be sexist) as strong as the T-X, Loken did well.<br/><br/>The movie was definitely very entertaining. The action was very good, special effects amazing, with some good laughs. It didn't give you a chance to get up and take a leak (there was no intermission !). I would definitely recommend it to any action/sci-fi movie or Arnold fan.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie deserves a 9 out of 10."

","Ok I ended up watching this movie on the big screen because I got carried away by the ratings posted here and there. Left on my own, I would not have watched this on big screen, perhaps just on VCD. I figured out that another Terminator sequel is destined to be an overkill and 'forced' extension of previous films, just like most other part >1's (there is Jurassic park, halloween, fast n furious, etc). The trailers didn't help, I just felt it'd be a corny try...<br/><br/>Anyways, now that I have watched it in fully glory, I'd say I was wrong. In terms of computer graphics, this film excelled. There was just too much action and graphics that at the start, I thought they would be distracting and that I have to consciously suspend disbelief from time to time throughout the show. Well that thinking is expected as long as we're still awake. However, the conscious suspension of disbelief soon fades away and you find yourself ""in"" the movie before you know it! It has grabbed you with its mammoth action scenes and stunning visuals and put you right at the heart of the movie where you have to say to yourself, watch out!<br/><br/>The story was decent and the concept was almost new. I won't expound on this lest I'll spoil your ride. :) Some of the intended jokes felt artificial though. The end was uplifting though bittersweet. Acting-wise, average. The sound effects were incredible, music just fine. A 3/4 for me. What a ride!"

","The main problem I had with Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines is that it's a film that feels a bit too familiar. While I would say that T3 does have many action sequences, that in itself is the problem. T3 feels like one long chase scene, but offers no real reward at the end.  Character development seems to be drowned in the relentless action, and the film suffers from it as a result. Also the plot line seems to be borrowed from its predecessor T2, making it very predictable, and somewhat outdated; especially when swartzenegger spills his famous line ""I'll be back,"" that was popular over a decade ago. There is a fine light in the film, and that light comes in the form of Claire Danes, who plays an everywoman veterinarian. Danes adds a bright spot with her fine acting skills, but she seems as though she could have contributed more to the film, had the film actually focused on characters, rather than being forced to giveway to exploding cars, and other mindless action that would make a demolition derby seem sophisticated."

This movie was fantastic. In it, Arnold is back again as the futuristic cyborg who must protect John Conner (Nick Stahl) from a robot assassin, this time played by Kristanna Loken. Arnold is back in the role that made him Ahnold. Kristanna Loken is a great villain (Not to mention super hot). She is no T-1000, though the action sequences were incredible and their were some unexpected twists that caught everyone in the theater off-guard.

","I was fully expecting to be disappointed with this film, especially after what I considered the existential failure of ""The Matrix: Reloaded,"" earlier this year. Pleasantly, I was not. Any movie that starts off with a nuclear bang is okay in my book, and things picked up nicely thereafter.<br/><br/>Arnold does the thing he does best (laconic one-liners), Nick Stahl is a suitable replacement for Ed Furlong (mostly due to decent acting chops and a certain resemblance to Michael Biehn), the effects are pretty much flawless, the chase sequences rock, the Terminatrix is a satisfying upgrade from the T-1000, and the ending is not only a darkly enjoyable conclusion to the (relatively thin) plot (which is pretty much a retread of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" minus Sarah Connor), it leaves things nicely open-ended for yet another sequel. I left the theater feeling that I got my money's worth; what more can you ask?<br/><br/>My only complaints would center on the script's reliance on a number of coincidences that raise the eyebrow of believability (including the otherwise enjoyable cameo appearance of Dr. Silverman), and what I felt was the miscasting of Claire Danes. I'm not sure why I felt that way, as I consider her to be a gifted actor, but she just rubbed me the wrong way. I suppose repeated viewings will soften my opinion, perhaps. (3/10/07 edit: I just learned that Sophia ""The Hitcher"" Bush was originally cast in Danes' role, but was let go shortly after production began because the director felt she was too young. One can only wonder how this film would have fared thus cast...) <br/><br/>Nutshell opinion: T3 moves the franchise forward with workmanlike style and panache, and leaves the viewer anticipating the next chapter. My hope is that when ""T4"" rolls around, we get to see Arnold playing the human being upon whom his Terminator was modeled."

","Now THIS is what summer movies are all about! Instead of having PG-13 action, it goes all out with its $170 million budget and having some realistic blood, while keeping it reasonable and believable. It's basically 105 minutes of wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am with a small story thrown in, but it's basically a recycled plot with a new character, a newer robot, and great special effects! Although they went all outand I mean all outit looked really good! It's not some cheesy Universal blockbuster that just throws bad FX wherever, the ones in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines looked real, and I only hope that Arnold's stuntperson was paid well.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger is back in kick-butt form as the T-800 Terminator. Not only does he rehash his catch phrases, he is able to bring back the fun in action movies that has been missing the last twelve years. It's a really fun time. As I've said before, Arnold's not a great actor, but when he's an action star instead of trying to act, he's really fun to watch. He seemed really game to do this movie.<br/><br/>The plot is nothing special. Arnold comes back from the future to protect not only John Connor (Nick Stahl) this time, but also feisty Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), because she'll be a general against the machines in the upcoming war. However, a T-X (Kristanna Loken), the most advanced Terminator cyborg from the future, comes to destroy all of the former classmates of John, because they'll join the resistance. As you can see, the plot's not as good as the first two.<br/><br/>If you put your mind on hold, which I was willing to do for this, T3 is a very entertaining sequel. Although it won't win awards, it's better than most out there now.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong sci-fi violence and action, and for language and brief nudity."

The story, though as as much of a central as in T1 and T2, still manages to be very compelling, as what would be expected from ""The Terminator."" The effects, though does make use of CGIs, isn't overdone, and relies heavily on Stan Winston's ""Terminator Effects.""

","In a summer where film companies are dishing out loads of pointless sequels to mediocre movies, it's a big surprise when one of these sequels actually comes out as something other than a complete copy of it's predecessor. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines succeeds where so many sequels fail: in originality. With the movie's star cast, fantastic action sequences and impressive story, it's not hard to guess that T3 will go down in film history as one of the most engaging action/sci-fi movies ever created.<br/><br/>T3 focuses on John Connor (Nick Stahl), leader of the human resistance against the machines in a futuristic war-torn planet Earth. John, having stopped judgment day 12 years ago with the help of T-101 (Arnold Schwarzeneggar), has broken off all contact with the world and has become a drifter, knowing deep down that judgment day is still near. A new terminator, the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is sent into the present to kill John Connor and his future lieutenants. The story also involves Katherine Brewster (Claire Danes), a veterinarian's assistant who plays a key role in John Connor's life and the future of the resistance. Another T-101 is sent into the present to ensure the protection of John Connor and Katherine Brewster, and to lead them to safety before the coming of judgment day.<br/><br/>The story to T3 is very strong, considering the fact that Terminator creator James Cameron is missing this time around. His replacement for this entry is Jonathan Mostow (U-571), who does a superb job in recreating James Cameron's vision of the future and of the machines who rule it. The story does a good job in answering questions such as why judgment day is still going to happen, and the roles that each character plays in the future. The story will make the viewer believe that there was a need to make this sequel, because there was still a story to tell.<br/><br/>The actors in this movie stay true to their roles. Arnold is back, and although it's safe to say that this will probably be his last Terminator flick, he does a great job in reprising his role as the protector of John Connor. Edward Furlong, who played John in T2: Judgment Day, is missing this time around, but his replacement Nick Stahl keeps things going as the young man who still questions his role in life. Kristanna Loken is good as the Terminatrix. She brings the attitude and personality that Robert Patrick portrayed in T2. Claire Danes does a good job in her role, seeing that this is her first big role in an action movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a top-notch action movie that does just about everything right. T3 brings the classic movies together into one unforgettable sequel that will be sure to please fans of the original movies."

IMO there would have been no difference if anyone else (than Arnold) played the T-800. U don´t really care anymore. All that Arnold ""built up"" in T2 is gone. And in one scene the T-800 tells us ""I´m another T-800, not the one u met before"" ... or sth. And actually that´s all u need to know.

Arnold played his part as the emotionless cyborg excellently as usual. Nick Stahl was pretty convincing as the future leader John Connor and Claire Danes was just there. nothing really standing out in her role. Newcomer Kristanna Loken played the T-X very well. Unfortunately the new female terminator just didnt seem as terrifying as the previous terminators and really didnt give you that sense of hopelessness and despair as Robert Patrick's and Arnold's previous terminator roles did. you wanna be scared of the terminator, not drool over it. but i guess that was the whole point. drool and be scared at the same time.<br/><br/>overall, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was an entertaining summer flick and one of the better big-budget action movies released in a while. the ending was one that made you think yet very dissapointing. kinda like terminator sorta kinda maybe 2.5. i think James Cameron's direction would have been much better. an average action flick with the Terminator name stamped on it."

It has very solid script and I counted only two moments, which might be edited out.<br/><br/>Visual effects are very good, but they are not extraordinary. Anyway it is better this way, that vice versa in Star Wars Episode II.<br/><br/>There are several funny episodes, which does not spoil movie at all. One can laugh or not, because movie does not depend on them at all. It is like T1 episode in hotel, when Arny selects ""@##! off"" from menu. That one also was decoration, but very good one.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE<br/><br/>*****************************************<br/><br/>I liked ending, it is first not happy end for Terminator movies. It should have been that way. Machines are too powerful even now and once they got loose, nothing will stop them. It is better not to start such things. Also, movie shows that machine can be really human, but not by behavior as in second terminator. It shows that they can make choices, which are against their orders and which are right in human sense. Of course, it is not very sophisticated in the scene, where Arny breaks the car, instead of killing John. BTW, Arny is really great: just recall scenes with sunglasses.<br/><br/>There is couple of logical and technical mistakes in the movie, which are not very critical. At first, how Skynet can start sending virus, if it was only in air force laboratory and not connected anywhere else? Also it was not even self-aware, so it should not have had evil intentions at that point. At second, phrase ""our firewalls are holding virus"" sounds great, but I hope, it is not a case and military networks are completely physically separated from Internet. At third, it is just usual stuff in action movies, Terminatrix was able run with speed of a car, but it cannot overtake Kate and John in the tunnel on the airbase.<br/><br/>And last, I like Claire Danes and Arnold Schwarzenegger (in case if I meet him someday :), but rest of the actors play looks a bit forced.<br/><br/>*****************************************<br/><br/>I gave 9 of 10."

","I saw Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines on July 2, the night it premiered and I was blown away by it. I was expecting it to not be all that great because James Cameron didn't direct this one but Arnold Schwarzenegger was in it and that was worth it enough to go see it. He reprises his role as the T-800 Terminator in terrific fashion and once again proves that he is the reason for these movies. One element missing that I wish Terminator 3 had was Sarah Conner. I'm glad we got an explanation of why she wasn't in this one but I think it would've been more interesting in some areas if she was in it. I was sketchy about how a third Terminator film could even take place with T2 almost virtually eliminating any plot for a third one but it is explained very well as to how a third one can take place. The Terminator (Arnold) explains that the events of T2 only postponed judgment day but that it was inevitable. Nick Stahl did a fine job as John Conner. Kristanna Loken was the perfect fit for the T-X and she was very nice to look at as well. Claire Danes did scream a little too much and was kind of annoying in her role as Conner's future wife Kate Brewster and I didn't see much chemistry develop between her and Stahl in the film. I thought it was clever to put in some sexual innuendos between the male and female terminator during their fight scenes (e.g. the T-X reverse wrapping her legs around the Terminator's waist, grabbing his you know what area and picking him up). The ending was a shocker but it was a great ending nonetheless. I was pleasantly happy with Terminator 3 and Jonathan Mostow deserves some credit for the way he directed this film. It's not easy to fill Cameron's shoes especially for the Terminator franchise. If you loved the first two films, you must see the third one. It is worth it and I plan on seeing it again in the theater I liked it so much. I'm not as picky as some people are when it comes to movies but I highly recommend watching this if you're a fan of the Terminator movies."

","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>I was a little worried going into this one. The Robobabe Terminator angle felt like a desperate attempt to inject some (unneeded) sex appeal into the franchise. I was worried there was going to be a scene where the Terminator and his Termimistress were going to try to consummate their Roboaffair. I am happy to report my fears were vanquished. Or do I mean terminated? They didn't really exploit her femininity at all. The supermodel Terminator was just there as a pleasing visual effect.<br/><br/>So I'm relieved to tell you that ""Terminator 3"" is a success. This is a return to form for Schwarzenegger. It may very well be the best movie of the summer. I found myself amazed at some parts. The demolition derby with the big trucks was the kind of mindless destruction I used to associate with Arnold flicks. Great to see it back.<br/><br/>So once again the Terminator has to jump through the time portal and save John Connor's rear end. Why does the human resistance keep sending back a dinosaur machine like Arnold? Surely they could come up with a more advanced killing machine or at least upgrade Schwarzenegger to meet the current supermodel preferred version.<br/><br/>At any rate, the two Terminators are going to have to face off. This was the part I worried about the most. Was I going to enjoy watching a hot babe walk off the cover of Vogue and thrash Schwarzenegger? Could I even believe it was possible? Once again, the movie succeeds. Their fight in the bathroom was fantastic. It was a special effects overload.

","Personally I wasn't too pleased with Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines even though the movie unexpectedly ended the way I had hoped for. The feeling I was given during Terminator 1 and 2 was completely gone by the third. I blame this mainly on the music and weak characters. I see the first two movies as a puzzle. All the pieces seemed to fit together because James Cameron took the movies to heart and made sure everything was perfect. In the third movie it seemed like the movie was filled with many holes. The theme was completely lost, certain elements which I had hoped to see (the familiar picture of Sarah Conner from the previous movies, how in the world Cyberdyne Systems was able to rebuild itself and continue research) never showed.<br/><br/>Agree with me or not, I believe that Arnold shouldn't have been in this movie. He was no longer necessary for the movie. Having another Terminator going back through time even though it was getting old with all these Terminator's going through time just doesn't work in my opinion. T3 should have been focused on the character John Conner more and on the birth of Skynet as it unleashed its wrath upon the world. I would have continued with the ""Empire Strikes Back"" theme but would have put more emphasis on it. I would have shown more T-80's (Those Terminator's from the T2-3D show at Universal Studio's.)<br/><br/>Now for the point of me posting this topic. I feel the 4th and final movie should include Kyle Reece. His importance in playing the important role of the soldier going back in time to protect the past Sarah Conner is all too important.

Obviously, Arnold is the boxoffice star, but he is not the protagonist of the story.  Neither is John Connor, for that matter.  Since Mostow didn't have a problem casting Nick Stahl as John Connor, he should have cast another actress as Sarah Connor -- T3 needed Sarah Connor.  And why is Eddie Furlong not in this film?

","Terminator was a great movie in it's own right. It was an 80s horror film that introduced many of us to Arnold (those of us who hadn't seen Conan). However, Terminator lacked intricacy in it's writing and plot. That problem was quickly resolved in Terminator 2, which showed us that there was so much more to the future, Skynet, and Cyberdyne systems than we thought. Terminator 2 not only brought more story to the table, but more action. It also introduced us to a couple of great actors (Robert Patrick, Edward Furlong). The long anticipated Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines picked up right where T2 left off. Where can you go from T2, some may ask? The story was already brought to a conclusion, right? Wrong. Just when you thought you knew everything, you finally realize that you hardly anything. T3 does exactly what T2 did for Terminator. It takes us even DEEPER into the world of the Terminators and answers a lot of questions that many of us had after T2. The creators of this movie took a series that seemingly had it's strings tied up and created a whole new chapter that is brilliant in it's depth. Not only does T3 bring a great story to the table just as T2 did, but it too brings blockbuster action. After watching T3, it's arguably the best action movie of this summer. Mostow does a great job of filling in for Cameron (we miss you James!). It's truly enjoyable to watch action movies as they used to be made...without much aid of computers. Matrix Reloaded was great...but it relied heavily on computer imagery. Most of T3's action is genuine, jaw dropping stunts. And just as T2 introduced us to new Hollywood faces, so too does T3. Nick Stahl, who plays John Connor, has a great deal of acting talent. He brings his own touch to the character of Connor, now 20 something. We see a whole new side of Connor, very different from the one we saw in T2. In T2, Connor was a rebellious teen who just wanted to have a good time with his friends at the arcade. T3 shows us a worn down, depressed, junkie. Stahl did an excellent job of pulling off the role. He reminded me very much of Tobey Macguire in this movie, perhaps due to his narration and soft-spoken demeanor. We're also introduced to Kristanna Loken, who plays the T-X. It's hard to gauge whether anyone who's recruited to play a terminator truly has any acting talent. The role just doesn't do actors any justice. They must literally constrain their acting talents to the confines of a robot. We obviously know, now, that Schwartzenegger and Patrick were better actors than their terminator roles made them out to be. So too will be the case, I believe, with Loken. Not just anyone can play the role of a terminator. It takes a certain breed and I believe the creators of T3 did a great job of casting. All in all, I give this movie a 9.5, but seeing as that's not a choice, I just rounded up to 10. Bash me if you wish, but I suggest you see the movie. It really is worth the time and money. It delivers in every possible way."

As in the other two movies, the science fiction story, though solid, is a bit sleight and is really just a framework for the kind of thrilling chase scenes one usually associates with these movies. In content, T3:Rise of the Machines could actually be called T2.5:Judgement Day, but frankly I wouldn't mind seeing TEN more films with this same outline-they are just so fun to watch!

","Along side The Matrix Reloaded, T3 is the second best film of 2003. I enjoyed every bit of the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger was incredible, revisiting his role as T-800 and the girl that played the Terminatrix was both sexy and mean. I liked her character as well. The action was great, and unlike The Hulk, this film gave me everything I anticipated. Oh, and it was worth the 11 year wait."
"timsf","Null","0","0","7 July 2003"," Action scenes with little plot
","Ok, there is this movie called Terminator 3, but the only thing that resembles anything related to the Terminator franchise here is Arnold and, unfortunately, he alone doesn't convince me that this is the Terminator.<br/><br/>T3 is a not-bad summer action film, full of action and adventure, but not much in the way of a plot. I read a comment on imdb that says that the ending alone is worth the price of admission; that reviewer is apparently very easily amused.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, which does have some interesting action sequences, there was a noticeable lack of depth. T3 almost seemed like it was developed ""by committee"" with little bits that had a certain feel, and other bits that had another feel.<br/><br/>Kristanna Loken, who played the T-X, was fine as an actress. She performed her role well. But, what is the point of getting a supermodel to play John Connor's killer? Her beauty had nothing (at least not revealed in the film) to do with the role of the T-X, and there was no reason not to use a more sinister character. Casting her degraded the film to less-than-science-fiction, because good science fiction films avoid such fluff. Based on T3, I could see Kurt Russell, Steven Segal and maybe Jackie Chan getting involved in T4, almost to the point of slapstick<br/><br/>T3 actually hinted that the 'plot' was about to go somewhere, when the T-X began programming machines to help her. This was where it was getting interesting, and it happened pretty early on in the film. I could see where the ""Rise of the Machines"" subtitle was being utilized. Then it totally fell flat, with virtually no mention of the rise of any machines, except little bits that were touched on here and there, and that which was implied at the end of the film.<br/><br/>The special effects and action scenes were technically good, but my policy is that good special effects, by themselves, are useless.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is somewhat interesting, with a light plot and strong action sequences, although in the end it seems as if I was ripped off with hardly any payoff. Certainly not along the lines of T2 (James Cameron), which is one of the best films to ever come out of Hollywood, and one that I've seen dozens of times. T3 had none of that."

","I must admit that I was not expecting a tremendous movie when I went to see T3. I was happily surprised at how fast paced and fun this movie was straight off the bat.  There was some great suspense as I found myself asking of the main<br/><br/>characters: ""How are you going to get away from the T-X now?""  Kristanna did a great job at playing the hard-core, cold-hearted killer that every Terminator should be.  She was brutal and efficient, and best of all never stopped in the middle of killing someone in order to explain her master plan.   I like that in a villain.  Arnold was once again amazing as the protector, and Nick and Claire were fantastic as his suporting cast.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an action-packed flick that has some great twists and turns. The ending is also perfect for the ideas and theories the story conveys about fate and free will."
"SSJAniFan","Null","0","0","7 July 2003"," Better than 2, but surpasses the first? No.
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS.  READ WITH CAUTION.<br/><br/>The first Terminator movie was an excellent action-thriller, with Arnold is a complete cold-hearted a-hole.  The 2nd Terminator movie was supposed to be even better, but it was a dry, worthless, shameful rip-off of the original. So, how does part 3 stand?<br/><br/>I've hated just about every movie I've seen since May.  X-men 2 was disappointing, Matrix 2 just plain stunk, and Hulk was bad.  Very, very bad. T3 is actually more enjoyable than these films, but it fails to capture the magic of the first one.  However, it at least does not cut-and-paste every scene from the first one into this one, like part 2 did.  Overall, it's not exactly the best action flick of the year *cough, Cowboy Bebop*, but it does have some memorable scenes.<br/><br/>Questions fill my head.  No, not ones that question the series continuity, but ones like:  How come in the series, any time the good guys or bad guys touch a single vehicle, it does not last even five minutes before getting destroyed?  This question haunted my brain during the entire third film.<br/><br/>The TX in this one is basically a T-1000 on steroids.  It has the same abilities as Robert Patrick's character, plus literally can do almost anything.<br/><br/>The action emphasis on this one is more on destruction than the first two films combined(not that the second one counts, since it was just the first film with the characters changed).  The scene where this is most evident to me is in one scene in which T-101 and TX fight in hand-to-hand combat, pretty much destroying everything in their path.  More things get demolished in this part than in an episode of Dragonball Z.<br/><br/>That one psychologist from the first 2, Dr. Stieberman, makes a humorous return appearance.  It happens about halfway through the film.  Speaking of humor, there's quite a few humorous scenes throughout the entire film, moreso than the first one.<br/><br/>This film probably wouldn't exist had Cameron chosen to use the original ending to T2.  Some people are probably really happy about that.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE:  If you're looking for a decent, brain-dead action-adventure flick, this is currently your best bet."
"johnsaucier1977","10","0","0","7 July 2003"," Great movie!
","I went into this expecting a decent movie, and was pleasantly surprised. Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong as the John Connor, who is now a man, with a destiny. I think Nick Stahl did a good job as John Connor and was completely believable. Claire Danes does the best job in this movie in my opinion as Kate Brewster, a future lieutenant and wife to John Connor. She has this amazing charisma about her and I enjoyed watching her on the screen. Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as the T-101 (NOT T-800 like the Plot outline says, jeez get it right!) terminator, now obsolete. I wasn't a big fan of some of the one-liners he used but it was a decent performance in spite of it. Kristanna Loken plays the new T-X terminator. Now although she has very few lines, her face speaks in great detail. Earl Boen also reprises his role as Dr. Silberman in a quick spot, which I found to be very funny.<br/><br/>Now as far as the movie goes I think this was more funny than the previous versions but it still maintain its action/thriller appeal. It was suspenseful when it needed to be and that was very important. And I think the last thirty minutes of this movie were really quite good and thought provoking. The end really came too soon, which was my only disappointment. I don't really enjoy movies which try to stick too much information in too little time, as this movie does. However its done well enough that you do not become bored or puzzled at some of the things that happen. However my only problem is this film really should have been longer. I think had they had another twenty or thirty minutes we could have seen a little more story. The movie seems more concerned with the action than the dialog which doesn't quite turn me off, though I would have liked to see more. My hope is that the DVD will include much more that was cut from the film. And I think while deleted scenes are good, I'm much more on the special editions where the cuts are seamlessly added to the theatrical release. In any case this movie is good, and can only get better with more scenes. I for one am wishing and waiting for a fourth installment."
"Quincey_P_Morris","9","0","0","5 July 2003"," Perfect Summer Movie (Minor Spoilers)
","Minor Spoilers<br/><br/>Terminator 3 is exactly the type of movie that I like to see as part of the summer blockbuster season. It's loaded with incredible looking action, it's humorous , and it has a huge cheese factor. The storyline is only used just to get to the next explosion or the next joke. But even so, for the most part the story seemed right on par with the previous installments, and at the ending, it completely took off and a classic was born.<br/><br/>In a huge departure from the previous installments, director Jonathan Mostow has taken the James Cameron-abandoned franchise and made it his own with a very exciting and thrilling film. I thought the ending of T3 was simply amazing and such a welcome change from the 'happy' ending that follows so many of the summer movies. Very courageous of Mostow as well, I might add.<br/><br/>The films titanic budget is all up there on the screen and was used to great effect (minus Arnie's $30 million take of course).<br/><br/>The action in this movie is truly the show stopper here. The sequence with the upending crane truck was absolutely staggering and completely blew my mind. The best car chase scene I have ever scene (or at least the most destructive). The hearse sequence, is also very noteworthy. The action sequences never let up and really demonstrate just how far along the advances in CGI, animatronics, and even make-up have come. Kudos to the always excellent work by Stan Winston with his T-X design and fully-functioning T-1 robots.<br/><br/>I think that what many of the negative reviewers of this film take issue with is the lack of subtle humor that was so prevalent in the first two movies. The comedy was put into overdrive for this film, as Arnie delivers more one-liners than ever, some of them absolutely atrocious. But if you can just laugh them off, you'll still be in for a great ride. The humourous cameo by Dr. Silberman was a nice touch.<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger however to my surprise, is still very convincing as the cybernetic organism that he first played almost twenty years ago, and his physique for the most part is as it was back in 1984, although he does look a little smaller. Kristanna Loken did a great job too as the female T-X, but I still think that Robert Patrick as the merciless T-1000 is still the most ruthless of the villain Terminators.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl and Claire Danes as John Connor and Kate Brewster respectively, also put in decent performances. Connor does look like a grungy vagrant, but a liquid metal terminator coming through the future ten years ago solely to kill you, is bound to be somewhat traumatic for the guy, and might just cause him to live an alternate lifestyle.<br/><br/>All in all, a very entertaining popcorn flick. Highly recommended if you enjoy action movies, or the Terminator film franchise (if you can digest some minor plot holes). I can't wait for the DVD, and I hope that T4 gets the greenlight too, with Mostow once again at the helm."

","Terminator films are supposed to rule.  Even in the age where sequels, by definition, suck, somehow Terminator 2 still ruled (maybe even more than the first).  A standard was set, they aimed high and they hit higher with strong characters, a strong story and excellent effects.<br/><br/>T-3 did NOT rule, however.  There was virtually NO story, the special effects were completely derivative of T2 (couldn't the cgi geeks come up with something better?), the characters were so devoid of depth that you almost wished them dead and the authors copped out by simply dismissing the well crafted plot of the earlier Terminator films.<br/><br/>The introduction of cute one liners from T2 was so overused in T-3 that it got stale quicker than a ""Charlie's Angels"" sequel.  The film makers of T-3 simply cashed in on a proven formula and didn't seem to care one bit about fumbling on one of the best film storylines ever created.  I, for one, had expected that they would have spent much more time on the story and had done justice to the prior films.

That background music that you hear playing was different (oddly different) than the other two. Kristina Loken did a great job as the TX, though a bit robotic in her actions, she had the look and glare that said she had what it took to be as ""unstoppable"" as Arnold and Robert were in the first two... but not as creepy.  I know it may sound odd, but I blaim her lack of creepyness on the score.  I was expecting to hear the violin screams and machine roars as in T2 which made the T-1000 absolutley desturbing for me.  When I did her the T-1000's music in the background (which was only about 4 times lasting 3 seconds) I was like ""OKAY!!! Here we go!""... Then it was gone.  Oh well.

"brimatt2412","10","0","0","5 July 2003"," Good casting choices
","Terminator 3 was a very enjoyable movie due to both a good story and good casting choices to surround Arnold.  Kristanna Lokan is the standout of the movie as the ultra-sexy and menacing Terminatrix (TX).  She has terrific screen presence and makes for a cold and relentless villain, on par with Robert Patrick's terrific turn as the T-1000 in T2. Here's hoping Lokan gets more good roles in the future.  Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both do well in the pivotal  parts of John Conner and Katie Brewster.  The relationship between these two characters is central to the film and Danes and Stahl showed good chemistry together.<br/><br/>The story I thought was very good with an interesting blend of humor with a grim storyline.  It worked, though.  The movie manages to tell a good story without being too pretentious or taking itself too seriously.  The ending was certainly an eyebrow raiser and certainly distinguishes it from the other two Terminator films.<br/><br/>One complaint I have was the lack of the Terminator theme music in the movie(until the end credits, anyway).  But other than that, I thought the movie did what it set out to do- tell an interesting story while entertaining the audience. 10/10"

If it were a stand alone movie, that would be enough. But since it follows two of the best sci-fi movies ever made, it's a bit of a letdown, but not much.<br/><br/>This movie is certainly worth watching in the theaters, if for nothing else than the action sequences. Of which there are some doozies! The chase scene with the crane alone is worth the price of admission!<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was well done. Being an action flick, I'm not looking for Oscar worthy performances, but I did start to care about these people. Kristanna Lokken did quite well as the T-X, her performance as such rivals that of Robert Patrick as the T-1000 in T2, and she has a nice butt to boot! Nick Stahl fills in quite well as John Connor, though I still would rather have seen Edward Furlong reprise his role and give the film more of a connection to its predecessors. Claire Danes works well too, though her part seems a bit like a redux of Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor from the first film, even to the point where John Connor says to her in a scene, ""You remind me of my mother!"".<br/><br/>Then of course there's Ah-nuld! what can I say? The man was born to play this part! The only problem I had with this rendition of the T-800 (or T-101 in this film) was that for the first 2/3 of the movie, the script relies so heavily on the amusing one-liners (in their defense, they ARE funny!)that the movie threatens to become a parody of itself.<br/><br/>Jonathon Mostow does a good job directing, but I really would have liked to have seen what Cameron would have done with this movie. His absence I think is what stops this movie from being great.<br/><br/>The biggest gripe I have with this movie is its ending. While it does set up a possible T4 movie, it is anti-climatic to say the least, and furthermore in contradiction to the theme of T2.<br/><br/>I give it a 6.5 out of 10."

","OK, you know what?  Arnie can't carry a movie with the Terminator shtick anymore... it's just gotten TOO old.  You gotta give him credit for looking so good at his age, but all the one liners he's forced to utter seem so contrived and derivative (as does the majority of this movie).  And that opening sunglasses gag?!...  Gimme a break!<br/><br/>It was Edward Furlong and Linda Hamilton's energy & desperation that brought T2 home, and their absence is acutely felt here (not to mention James Cameron's story telling and direction).  I'm sure Furlong's real life personal challenges could have been incorporated to make John Connor's current state that much more striking... but oh, that would be too ""risky"" for such a cash-cow franchise.  Clare Danes is the only actor here that could have generated some real empathy and humanity in this movie, but the poor writing does not ask her to.<br/><br/>Robert Patrick's liquid-metal Terminator was excellent in T2 (still gives me the creeps just thinking about it) and his abilities & limitations really added to the story and made some kind of sense.  Kristanna Loken's coolness was great and her TerminatriX had real potential (should have had more sexy/gory scenes) but was ultimately derivative, as well.  In addition, I didn't buy her upgraded terminator-ability of molting specific body parts into complicated machinery, and even less the idea that they could be permanently ""damaged"".  (The story suffers when the writers don't follow their own rules.)  God knows what unbelievable gimmick they'll come up with for T4, to try to out do the T-X!<br/><br/>The action scenes were impressive, but I've grown tired of chase scenes pretty much altogether, each one trying to out do the last... they're just silly (e.g. Matrix Reloaded)... try spending the same time advancing the plot!  (The last time I saw a decent chase scene was Ronin.)  On top of that, they must have had wheels on the crane spreaders for that thing not to completely tip over right away!<br/><br/>The only part that was really new and interesting was the end, at the military research facility, with the prototype robot tanks and planes running amok, but that was like only 10 minutes!  There should also have been much more interaction with Colonel(?) Brewster, instead of killing him off as soon as they get to the research facility.  It also made ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE that there were no military personnel manning that VIP bomb shelter...  Very weak.  However, I did like the CGI of nuclear missiles and explosions, but they didn't play up the Apocalypse enough... don't want to use up too much T4 material, I guess.<br/><br/>Since this movie does a complete 1-80 with the deterministic aspect of fate (I thought ""Fate is what you make it""?), it is a lot less hopeful than T1 & T2 were.  The only positive aspect about this new storyline is the relationship between John Connor and Kate Brewster, which everyone seems to like.<br/><br/>With the amount of money they spent and the potential of the Terminator/Skynet premise, I was very much disappointed.  This movie has its moments and could have been great, but it felt more like an expensive pilot for a post-doomsday TV series, and ends too early, just as things start to get interesting.  Hopefully, they'll hire some real storytellers for the inevitable T4 for which this movie appears to be a mere segue.  Rating for this `genre', given T2 is a 10/10:  6."

The second, Judgment Day, presented a great chase sequence, but progressed poorly thereafter with weak acting and a script that steadily worsened. While the special effects were amazing at the time, the film failed where it counts most: the appearance of sympathetic characters. This last installment, which hopefully will indeed be the last, is easily the weakest in the series with very poor acting, and a script that relies mostly on special effects and chase scenes.

","To each his own, but I cannot believe there are so many positive reviews for this movie. Doesn't anybody care that underneath the action and special effects there was nothing going on in this movie??? From Hollywood that's nothing new, but I thought Terminator fans had grown to expect more than that from these films. You can blow up as many things as you want, if I don't care about the characters on the screen than it's pointless.<br/><br/>
Look, the action scenes are nothing short of breath taking. Probably some of the best ever captured on film. That's about all the movie has going for it. The so-called story contradicts rules and plot points made in the first two films. There's never even a logical explanation of why T3 even occurs. Every time someone's about to explain that, or something else of importance, they either end it with a one liner or someone interrupts them. Lazy screenwriting. I don't mind them changing the theme of the movie, too bad they didn't change anything else. This is T2 with a woman and no subtext. The subtitle was fitting since like a machine, the movie was cold and emotionless. The humanity the was stressed in T2 is completely missing. Those of you calling this the best in the series need to rewatch the second film. Why is it nowdays that the minute a budget goes over $100 million, all semblance of originality, character development, and logical thought goes with it?<br/><br/>This is not a Terminator film. This is a very expensive fan film that almost parodies its predecessors. Like Friday the 13th or Halloween, they turn the character into a cartoon. They actually make a fool of the Terminator. You laugh AT him. Way too much humor that just doesn't work.<br/><br/>
Before seeing this movie I thought T2 had wrapped everything up and there was no need for a third. After seeing it, I KNOW there was no need for it. The only thing it was successful at was showing me what a skilled director Cameron is. This is crap, folks. I can't be nice about it. It was just a bad, bad movie that played its audience for idiots. The last line is a slap in the face. It's an insult to the intelligence of movie-goers.<br/><br/>
Everbody complains about the state of the movie industry. Then everyone fills these boards with positive reviews of crap like this. Only reassuring Hollywood they're making the right decisions. T3 may be bigger, louder, and faster than the first two but it's also a lot dumber. You can put the body of a ferrari on top of a Toyota, but just bc it looks good doesn't mean its worth getting into.<br/><br/>And Arnold clearly needs Cameron to bring out the actor in him. Thanks for ruining the Terminator guys. One more thing I loved that Hollywood's 'Nothing Sacred' attitude has ruined."

It's replaced with a quick intro about a neurotic man named John Conner, and a stereotypical daddy's girl who has a hotshot father in a secret military facility.<br/><br/>The whole anticipation of the Terminators finding John Conner is missing, replaced with a quick cut into a vet's office where ironically both Terminators find John Conner and Punky Brewster...err I mean Kate Brewster.<br/><br/>After that point, there isn't much time for explanation, it's just shoot this, shoot that, leading to a bland ending that could be used to milk the series for another few summers.<br/><br/>This movie was completely half-assed by directors, writers, and producers who weren't interested in reliving one of the James Cameron's greatest movie series of all time, but just using the name to sell tickets so they can suck the series dry before Arnold gets too old."

","ALL MY REVIEWS HAVE SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.<br/><br/>
Terminator 3 defies logic on so many levels. First of all, I have the same initial question with T-3 that I did with T-2. Why the hell does the future John Connor (or military personnel) continue to send old, obsolete model cyborgs to save him in the past? Wouldn't it make sense to send the same updated, slicker model that was sent to kill him? And why does the female T-X pump up her clevage to flirt with a cop? Isn't she the Terminator?? Why does she need tricks to get his gun? Just JACK HIM FOR IT like you do everything else!  Speaking of the cop's gun, why does she even need it?? Her arm can shape into a gun, a rocket launcher, and a flame thrower.  And why does she need to taste a bloody woman and bloody gauze pad to identify people?  Isn't her tongue made from the same synthetic material her finger is?  She should taste it as soon as she sticks her finger in it. She also murders a guy in a drive thru burger joint, but the window is on the right hand side.  Why?  Isn't this America??  And what happened to her mission to destroy John Connor's future lieutenants?  She abandons that idea early on and decides to pursue John Connor and his future wife for the duration of the movie.  The ending is anti-climatic.  So anti-climatic in fact, I don't even remember how they destroyed the female Terminator in the end.<br/><br/>T-3 is a poor movie with a convoluted plot, uneven pacing, and boring action.  The film in general feels small and incomplete.  It ends with a door open for a sequel, but my anticipation is greater for Problem Child 9. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is simply garbage and anyone who likes it is stupid.  Zero stars out of 5."

It is as different from T2 as T2 from T1.  I think it combines the cheesy B movie with the serious sequel and adds a bit of humor.

","I'll limit my comments so as not to reveal anything significant.<br/><br/>
Overall, I liked this movie.<br/><br/>It is not as groundbreaking or thrilling as the original one was when it was first released 19 years ago. It is not as mindlessly entertaining or slickly crafted as the second installment. It is, however, a worthy sequel.<br/><br/>Here, in a nutshell, is why: Have you seen the first two? Do you remember how bleak the first movie was, and how brilliantly (for an action movie) it played with the logical paradox of time? Do you remember how the second movie blatantly violated the paradox, and how this caused a nagging feeling of -well...- intellectual disappointment which diminished the strength of the film? How it got just a tad too mushy (diminishing, most notably, the power of the performance delivered by Linda Hamilton)? Well, this third installment ""fixes"" those problems, answers a bunch of begging questions, and returns very solidly to the stark tone of the original. Thank God.<br/><br/>Arnold turned in the expected performance. Claire Danes was surprisingly authentic. The plot was solid. I cannot say more without spoiling.<br/><br/>Pacing was a little spotty, but I think that was actually a strength - some things happened which really needed a pause from the buildup-to-climax which drove the original and second movies. The effects were well conceived and solidly executed.<br/><br/>The only defects I can point to: They tried just a little too hard with the TX - I dunno, but it seems to me that they could have done better with a little less ""oh, wow, look at THIS nifty feature"" nonsense; The actor playing JC was not particularly impressive in that role - I know what the intent was, but there was not enough evidence of character development to make his reactions at the ending really believable; Lastly, I think the end was just a tad too clinically executed - *I* would have hammered the audience quite a bit harder with the enormity of the events in question, so that instead of leaving the theater a little sad they'd leave staggering in awe and horror, but that's just me.<br/><br/>I'd rate T3 a solid 4 of 5, sliding scale adjusted for genre."

","Entertaining road movie that is, sadly, not as ambitious as the first two Terminator movies.

Nevertheless, Claire Danes is more than effective in her role, and Arnie's Terminator remains an iconic figure.<br/><br/>The crane chase may be the second best stunt of the summer, behind the Matrix Reloaded's freeway scenes."

","A lot of cynical people will not be pleased by this film, but the problem is not in the film they're watching. Ah-nold is geat once again as the T-101. Stahl does aight, Danes is ok, and the Terminatrx is rightfully creepy, and its about time we saw some female booty in these films. The start with Stahl narrating is unnecessary and too long. There mustve been better ways to explain the set up. The action scenes are fanatic, not qite as coherent as Cameron's but they are on a much bigger scale. T2 had a semi versus a motor bike, T3 has a big crane truck and a bunch of police cars versus a pickup. The terminator vs. terminator fights are terrific as well. The ending to this movie is absolutely brilliant. a lot of people are going to complain, but they are dumb. The end of this film finally clears up the paradoxes of time travel in the first two. In T2, when they destroyed the pieces of the previous T-101, that T-101 should've ceased to exist, sorta like Mike J. Fox n Back to the Future, but this problem is solved ingeniously. All in all, first is the worst, second is the best, and the third is in-between as far as this trilogy goes. Dont get me wrong, the original is great, it just hasnt aged well. It seems a lot of people have it out for Ah-nold, I really don't understand why, Arnold has more charisma ad star power in one  arm than the Rock or Vin Diesel have in their entire bodies. See this movie, lighten up, enjoy it. Arnold is still the king of action, and he makes  trumphant return to form in his film, which is his best since True Lies."
"sckoch","Null","0","0","4 July 2003"," Better than Expected
","Having, at last, seen the much hyped third installment, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  With such movies, I always watch as many previews as I can, read lots of reviews to get a feel for what other people think, and I try not to get my hopes up too high.  That said, there are three questions that must be asked.  Is it better than its predecessors?  Of course not!  Is it as good as it's predecessors? Yes...almost...particularly if you squint and cock your head to the left.  Is it a worthy addition to the dynasty? Absolutely!  I've read arguments that though TX is cool, she's a pale shadow of the grandeur that was T1000.  This is true.  But while T1000 was revolutionary, the TX seems the follow the natural progression. She was certainly acceptable.  She satisfactorily functioned with the absolute singularity of both the T101 and the T1000.  My main...in fact, my only complaint is that the heavy action commenced with very little preamble and, in my opinion, without enough explanation which really didn't work to the film's advantage as it did in T2 with the surprise of Arnold being the good guy.  I was placated, however, by the quality and originality of the action.  The action in this film was complex and well done and didn't drag on like the overwrought, rather pretentious scenes of the Matrix...but that's a whole other can of worms.  The acting is fine.  Arnold, who I think is always fun, is at last back in the role he was meant to play.  And 12 years later he still looks fabulous.  I would have liked to see Edward Furlong back, but junkies are notoriously difficult to employ.  Nick Stahl was more than satisfactory.  He captured the childlike vulnerability of John Connor that Furlong's youth gave him.  Claire Danes is wonderful as always. She's so real and genuine that it makes her very easy to care about.  And even if the movie hadn't been as good as it was, the ending would have made it worthwhile.  The rest of the story wasn't quite as internally cohesive as the other two, but it was reasonably close...but the end...I can't over stress how wonderful the ending is.  If you're not a total movie snob and as long as you don't think that the idea of the Terminator series is to make some huge social or cosmic point...if you'd like to see a movie with fantastic action sequences and effects, good humor, fine acting, and *gasp* a completely acceptable story with a stellar ending, go see T3.  You won't be disappointed...Oh and P.S.-I fear that there may be yet another sequel. And if there is...I don't think I'll be going to see it.  This movie ends too well (remember the end of Alien 3 followed by Resurrection? *shudder*)"

","i am sorry to report that t3 - rise of the machines, which could have been a truly great movie, nothing missing in terms of plot possiblities in that concept, fell totally flat, in fact melting into the ground in implementation.<br/><br/>most of the scenes were some kind of spoofy sub-par rehashes of previous scenes in the series, in terms of the continuity. the only think different was that the action was so over the top it was almost funny.  for one example there is a scene when the new t-x liquid metal terminatrix as she is being called, is driving a huge truck, which Arnold manages to get a grip on. The truck is like a ladder truck, so the terminatrix moves the ladder out to hit everyting it her path to knock the good terminator off.  When it hits a building, instead of wrecking the ladder, and bending it all around, the ladder goes through everything in its path, and does not slow down or twist the truck.  it is just ridiculous.  it takes so long to explain who how absurd this movie is, i just cannot do it.<br/><br/>onward now to the characters.  arnold is the same terminator, though how he plays this without crying at what they have done to the legacy of this series is beyond me.  the kid who played john connor was like a weaselly homeless guy, i suppose to give the loser teenage boys in the audience some hope or something. even this could have been used creatively, as some sort of play on how things can get twisted and goofed up, but that is way above the level of this movie.<br/><br/>the new terminatrix, seems to me like a terrible part.  she is supposed to be more advanced and more human-like to root out humans in the future that could detect the older clunky terminators, but they are clueless about writing her part.  She is this very sleep flawless beautiful women, and her programming seems to be to create as huge a disaster as possible for the cameras.  I still remember being chilled as the first terminator movie used its smarts to track down sarah connor in terminator.  i felt no suspence or tension with the terminatrix, just waiting to see how diverge from a good story to an exploitative one.<br/><br/>finally, the story is boring, predictable and does not draw one in in the least. after my initial understanding that this was a ripopff movie, i just stayed because i felt i had to, and to get my money's worth.  i have the other two of the series on dvd, but i would never consider this one, and would warn everyone away in hopes of sending the studios a message that we do not like being ripped-off."

","I have been a fan of the series my entire life, having seen the first two movies dozens of times (saw the first terminator at the age of 7 initially). After seeing this third installment yesterday, my heart was completely broken.  I didn't think I would take it that seriously, since it is just a movie, but I guess I did.  This is my favorite series after all, and I've been looking forward to the sequel for the last ten years.      What I saw, however, was not a terminator movie, but something else.  With all due respect to Mr. Mostow, it felt as if he had a vendetta to remove every single element that James Cameron had used to make the first two movies what they were, and expect this to be even half a decent sequel.  What was he thinking?  This movie turned into a disaster on a grand scale.  The terminator was completely ruined.  In the first movie, the terminator was portrayed as a cyborg from the future with no sympathy for its victims, and a mission to accomplish.  It was a killing machine, and in my opinion, it looked frightening, and serious.  The second movie I thought did an equally acceptable job at painting this picture.  Both movies had the right music, the right mood, and the suspense required for us to believe that these terminators are not playing around, not to mention the sympathy for the main characters.  They had a very dark touch to them, and seeing the movies as a little kid gave me the creeps.  In this sequel they took that entire aspect, and ripped it out, leaving it as a souless parody.  First off, where did that music go?  That was essential to the movies, but apparently it was decided to be unnecessary this time around.  Second, is this supposed to be the terminator, or a kindergarten cop?  What is the deal with all the poorly written jokes and the ridiculous one liners.  ""Talk to the hand"", ""I'm back"" - give me a break, this is supposed to be the terminator, but they decided to turn it into one long gay joke.  The T-X did not participate nearly enough in the story, and definitely did not display it's full potential. Frankly, I was not impressed.  Instead of an evil terminator, the T-X acted more like that evil alien dressed like a Victoria Secret model from Men in Black 2, although I can't say that I wasn't impressed by the entrance. Bottom line is that the 170 million dollar budget went into some special effects and nothing else.  Here you hardly even get to see the terminators killing their victims, most of it is off screen.  Where is the blood? What's the point of the R rating?  The budget for Terminator 1 was under $7 million, and a lot more was done with that, a LOT more.  Maybe I came in with too high expectations, and the next time I watch the film it won't seem as disappointing.  But  so far all I saw was a Sci-Fi channel original presentation."

","From the moment he walks on screen the T101 (Ah-nuld) is a gimmick...a pale shadow of the brutal killing machine in the first film and a one-liner spouting mockery of the ardent protector he played in the second. Sadly this film is more like the crappy first trailer that was released than the subsequent trailers that made the film look salvagable.<br/><br/>John Conner (Nick Stahl) is still pretty much whiney and pathetic and he seems to have developed a severe eodipal complex. Claire Danes has her 'Alien Ressurection moment' as Kate Brewster, the damsel in distress. While she has a bit more initial spunk and know-how, she is basically Sarah Conner from the first film, but not nearly as engaging as Linda Hamilton. The TX (Kristanna Loken) is a waste. She has some nifty powers, but she lacks any real 'personality.' The original T101 was brutal and methodical, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) was cold and steely, the TX can make her breasts bigger at will. A combination of T-101 and the T-1000, the TX (or Terminatrix as they refer to her once) is an endo-skeleton covered by the shape-changing liquid metal. She doesn't talk much--which is a blessing because her delivery is stale and wooden...much like the mannequins in the window she first appears with. Seems all she can do is cock her head like a confused labrador retriever.<br/><br/>The action and visuals are pretty good. Nothing really truly original, but it is at least moderately satisfying. Most of it takes the form of destroyed property. There are a couple of blood n guts scenes, but alot of the most gruesome stuff is kept off-camera. The soundtrack was mediocre...I missed the very recognizable Terminator theme music.<br/><br/>The writers try to tackle some of the plot-holes left by the first two (self-negating) films. Some of this works and some of it doesn't. This film and the events therein BEG to be taken seriously, but belagered with such horrible dialog and cheesy one-liners it's really hard to care about the impending war and subsequent apocalypse. All they (writers and director) really managed to do was turn a smart (albeit flawed) and intense franchise into a stale and watery crockery of fondue.

The cast is very good and the focus of the film is on John Connor and not on his mom like the two first ones were (T2 to a lesser extent) and it is truly a new chapter in the series.

","When I heard they were making another terminator movie, I didn't know what to expect. After seeing this movie though, I was really impressed. I honestly believe this movie is very good. Yes some of the jokes were really lame, like the talk to the hand thing, but many other complaints people have with the movie are unjustified. People have been complaining that Nick Stahl acted ""lost"" in the movie. Yet that was an element of his character. Even Arnold who's now around 60 was great. Claire Danes who doesn't do many action movies was wonderful in the movie. Not to mention Loken, who is amazing, acted her part pretty well. I'm not arguing that this movie is the best terminator. Yes we all know that Cameron is a great director, but Mostow is one too. The action and story are amazing. People have been complaining about how the movie doesn't require enough thought, but seriously the third time around I think everyone understands the concept by now. There wasn't much need to explain the war. Terminator 2 did that great. This movie is an excellent movie that I believe will make an excellent addition to the terminator series. My only concern is that in order to milk the franchise, future movies will begin to suck. Let's just hope I'm wrong. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!"

","Lots of action, always like new characters, especially hot ones. One of the few amusing scenes occurred in the beginning.There's a cliff hanger of an ending, so i'm sure they'll be a T4 in a few years. If you liked the previous terminators, it's worth the price of a ticket."

"txcheng","7","0","0","3 July 2003"," Not a worthy sequel.
","T3 is more of an attempt to simply do a sequel for money. The plot line is fairly convoluted and seems more like the second part in a trilogy.<br/><br/>Arnold is simply Arnold. He is okay, the action is as expected, lines seems more forced and the writing is not as witty as T2. Nick Stahl seems more like a TV actor and doesn't have the anger that Eddie Furlong portrayed in T2. Claire Danes does a decent job as his future spouse. Kristanna Loken as T-X is a little confusing as a character and a Terminator. Is she an improvement? She has more mechanical breakdowns than the T-1000 series. She is a babe. She tries to be icy like Robert Patrick did in T2, but to me she needs more training.<br/><br/>My major beef about the movie is some obvious script flaws. Claire's father is in charge of an secret Air Force research lab and she along with John Conner and Arnold manage to simply waltz into this facility without even a glitch, loaded with weapons and explosives. Good security, especially in the times we live in now.<br/><br/>The other downer is the end. How can the future be written in stone. I find this extremely unbelievable that not one thing all these people do, doesn't appear to change one thing in the future time line.<br/><br/>
I wish James Cameron was involved with this project. He is a much better writer/director for this type of genre."
"AMintKidIcedOver","9","0","0","3 July 2003"," Terminator 3 appeals to long time fans and newcomers as well, this was a great movie.
","Now im not going to give any of the movie away, because it will not be nearly as good if i do. T3 definitly takes a step up from T2 and T1 in the special effects department. Some of the special effects were absolutely breathtaking. The TX (Lokken)was brilliant as she acted so much like a machine i almost thought that she was! she has very few lines so for most of the movie, she uses facial expressions. She is also very...evil. within the first 20 minutes of the movie she kills quite a few people. Arnold comes back strong as the somewhat primitive Terminator Model-101. Again, like T2 he is greatly at the disadvantage. I think Arnold played the terminator better in T3 then he did in any of the other ones. He seemed a lot more like a machine.<br/><br/>As for Nick Stahl playing John Connor, when i first heard that he was replacing Edward Furlong i was really angry. Furlong was the original John Connor, not to mention hes a great actor. He would have been perfect to play Connor again. But i was pleasantly suprised, Nick Stahl played the part great, and you got the feel that he was very nervous, and unstable about judgement day and his destiny from the first moment you saw him. Kathryn Brewster(Claire Danes)is Connors supporting character and Danes does a much better job then i thought she was going to do. All in All, the acting was very well done.<br/><br/>The plot had some holes in it but not too bad. I think that they could have cleared a few things up. However, the ending stole the entire movie. I was completely stunned at the end, and it was very unpredictable....i had NO clue it was even coming.<br/><br/>All in All, definitly worth the $9.00, maybe another $9.00 if i want to go again.....i urge everyone to go see this movie, it was great<br/><br/>8.5/10"

Arnold looked great.<br/><br/>but the plot was average and somehow just wasn't as intelligent as T2.  i know I'm not supposed to expect intelligence from an action flick, but i did.  The acting was wooden and characters were one sided.  I had trouble understanding everyone's motivation.  (except for the terminator himself who by definition is one sided, wooden, and motivated).  There were also some unexplained idiosyncracies that seemed like the director was going to do something more but then changed his mind.  but then at the other extreme, there were some things that were very obvious, but yet were still drilled into us again and again.<br/><br/>overall, a good action flick.  but I was expecting more."

Now that I have seen it, I can positively say that this was a really good movie and would even enjoyable to the audience that hasn't been longing for this movie as I have. Although this movie was a bit more comical then the previous movies and there is a noticeable difference between this movie and the others because of the absence of James Cameron, it still holds that true Terminator feeling. My only problem with this movie would be the length, barely and hour and a half, which is an half an hour shorter than the spectacular T2. I do suggest this to any terminator or non-terminator fan, you don't need to know every thing about the story to keep you into like some new movies out right now."

"imminteract","10","0","0","3 July 2003"," A Triumph
","Well, after being treated to a sneak preview Tuesday night, I must say that this film is not what I originally expected.  The odds were against it: No Cameron, no Hamilton, no Eddie Furlong, but lo and behold, T3 is something of a masterpiece.  Not a perfect masterpiece, mind you.  But one truly worthy of note.<br/><br/>It has been a long time since a Terminator film graced theaters, and many people thought that was due to script rewrites and such, when actually the original Carolco Pictures company went bankrupt sometime after the second film.  Legal battles ensued for years, and finally a phoenix rose from the ashes.  But enough of this prologue, is it good?<br/><br/>From the unique presentation of the beginning (interwoven clips of the future and present-day footage) to the stirring action sequences (which unfortunately, harbor my only gripe), I was truly amazed with Jonathan Mostow's work.  I noticed that one review cited a plot hole:  the machines couldn't have reinstituted SkyNet because Arnold and the T-1000 were killed in the first one.  Well, one possibility is the arm.  Though it is not mentioned in the third installment, we all remember Arnold losing an arm in the second film, which was not destroyed.  Totally plausible.  There are other criticisms, but that was the most outspoken.  My only problems are the action sequences.  Yes they're great, and yes, the CG characters used in the scenes look more realistic than the Matrix Reloaded's Neo...but, sometimes there are too many cuts, and you lose track of where the action is.  Not enough wide establishing shots, too many closeups.  Of course a film is more cost-effective that way.<br/><br/>All in all, great acting, a great script, and amazing special effects make this film enjoyable, but what makes it remarkable is its subtle touch of heart.  Go see it, bring your family, and remember Arnold's last words in this movie, ""We will meet again.""  Sequel?"

Though Kristanna's Cyborg Character would've been more brutal to form, she did a swell job.

You try to come up with a better bad guy.  It ain't easy. The action was pretty solid and the movie doesn't waste time getting uncorked.  There are very few slow points to the movie. The plot has holes in it.  So what?  It's good enough to support the action and it's pretty hard to come up with a time travel plot that doesn't have holes in it.  Only Bill and Ted could manage most excellent time travel. Bottom line:   Action was solid, direction was pretty good, the acting wasn't as good as T2 and the music didn't have the drive of either of the first two.  So - - not as good as the first two but definitely worth the admission price."

However, that doesn't explain how they were able to destroy skynet, and I still think T2 was a good movie anyway.

That was way too high to set the bar.  As much as I love Arnold they couldn't have watched this and thought it was good.<br/><br/>Remote controlling cars from the early part of the movie was an indication of how bad things were going to get.  WHY?  Totally un-necessary and downright dumb.<br/><br/>Too Many Jokes.  He's not human and didn't need so many 80's style one-liners.  It was almost like watching the Brady Bunch Movies where they just mock the whole Brady Bunch theme.<br/><br/>Why wasn't she more upset about losing her fiancÃ©?  She got over it awfully quick.<br/><br/>There was no need for a romance between the characters.<br/><br/>The truck magically bounces over the girl to hit the terminatrix perfectly.

Where were the military personnel?<br/><br/>Why when the police were shooting them in the Hearse did they never hit a window where conners was hiding?  Why couldn't he have killed the swat members?  He's the Terminator with Barney programming?<br/><br/>The Terminator fights my re-programming scene?  Ouch.  Very Lame.<br/><br/>More of the Takeover of the machines in the base would have been better. That was your real chance to capitalize on the movie and you have 2 lame fight scenes and its over.  And how did conner and the girl get in there so easily?  What's with the lame missile through the window with the lamest missile explosion ever?  Might as well have been a bottle rocket.<br/><br/>The real question is where did they spend the so-called 180 million?<br/><br/>When did Conner become such a wuss.<br/><br/>I get the feeling this movie was just thrown together and never thought out at all.

","The first TERMINATOR remains my favorite film ever. The second is right up there. So as far as film going goes these films mean a lot to me. Is it just me or are big films getting worse by the month. Even with hints of decent stories pictures are so rushed now. Special effects, BOOM, special effects, JUMP CUT, F/X GALORE, BOOM...THE END.<br/><br/>I miss the days of the eighties action flicks. Even the early nineties hung in there a bit with TOTAL RECALL, TERMINATOR 2 (despite its morality) and NATURAL BORN KILLERS. My point is these films the good ones, the intense action ones...the fun ones all stuck with violence. Shying away from violence teaches us guns and explosions lack consequence. Not to mention it's all fantasy. We're being taught not to have imagination.<br/><br/>The evolution of film ceases to exist. Technology needs to complement not substitute a story (a la MATRIX RE-LOADED and Terminator 3). Hopefully M. Night or Peter Jackson, or some kid at home writing a great story will inspire us.<br/><br/>It's not all about violence but if you have menacing characters. Please make them convincing.<br/><br/>I wish the Girl-inator beautiful as she was would've kicked some more ass. She arrived only to kill some 50 year old Beverly Hills woman.

","Not really sure the direction the director was heading with the the third installment of the terminator series but definately not anywhere I would have liked it to gone.  It was almost as if Mostow took everything from the previous terminators and made them into a joke in this one.  Yes we all know that the terminator has to find clothes somewhere but the director has to make a joke out of it.  The terminator is a machine.  He would not know whether sunglasses were considered socially feminine.  I dont understand. I sat there and laughed the entire time I was watching the movie.  I wasn't laughing with the director but at just how horrible it was.  The jokes were funny in that way that you laugh because they are incredibly stupid.  Its almost as if it should have been a pg-13 kids movie aside from the swearing and blood.  I am a pretty big fan of the Terminator series, especially the first one, and was very dissapointed.  The first terminator had a very dark, intense style which was lost a little with the second one but still executed.  Everything that was good about the other ones was gone.  The acting was horrible, the plot was simple, and the tone was childish.  The movie is wraught with cheesey one liners and taglines and seemed unable to get passed that.  I feel sorry for James Cameron.  He must be crying right now.  The change is comparable to that Batman series.  Batman and Batman returns were good and then it all just went hollywood corporate.  The thing that suprised me the most was coming online and seeing that it was almost hard to find a bad review.  I guess that what I thought was cool about the first two was not what all the terminator nerds thought was cool. Its worse than what happened to the star wars series.  They thought the jokes were funny and all the talked about were the action sequences.  The first one had very little big budget action but it made up for it in story-line and suspense.  Try watching the first and third movies back to back and you can truly see how stupid the series has gotten.  Oh well, there were a few redeeming scenes that I can hopefully convince myself was worth the 8 bucks. The movie was a big cheesey joke. Don't see this movie unless your a big dork."

So if -- IF -- they do make a T4, it'll have to ""move on"" from here.  I was pleased with that.<br/><br/>Be warned: Arnold has more than his share of silly one-liners.  This one is definately more light-hearted than the previous movies.<br/><br/>I give it 9/10 -- maybe even 10/10."
"dsensing","Null","0","0","3 July 2003"," A grim movie, but could have been great . . .
","I have always thought that if a movie isn't worth seeing twice, it isn't worth seeing once. So would I pay my hard-earned scrip to see T3 again? Yes, but only because my wife wants to see it, and couldn't go opening night with the boys and me.<br/><br/>For some reason I was disappointed at the end - but my disappointment is with the ending itself, not because its technical achievements were less than advertised (they weren't).<br/><br/>Obviously, I can't give away the ending here, so I won't. But be forewarned, this is a grim movie, a deeply pessimistic movie. And the first two were not. Thus, the ending was out of synch with the series. I found it jarring. (It's also an extremely obvious setup for Terminator 4, which had darn well better be made because to end the series now would be a travesty.)<br/><br/>
That being said, T3 is an amazing piece of movie making. The main chase sequence is a definite contender for the best automotive chase sequence ever; IMO it wins hands down. (I say ""automotive"" chase because more than cars are used.) The sequence is long, paced just right, exciting and the integration between live action and computer scenes are absolutely seamless.<br/><br/>
Arnold S. is back in fighting trim; during final credits a teenage girl in front of us said, upon her mother telling her Arnold is 55, ""He looks fine for 55!"" Kristanna Loken as the T-X terminator (terminatrix?) performs the role extremely well, although truth be told, there ain't a lot of acting required of her; she utters maybe six sentences in the movie. The rest of the time she simply pursues Arnold, John Conner and Kate Brewster with stolid implacableness. Having a ""female"" terminator does work well.<br/><br/>
Kate Brewster, played by Claire Danes, is John Connor's love interest, although they don't so much as hold hands during the movie. As for her place in the story line, well, you'll have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>
At first, I didn't take a shine to Nick Stahl playing John Connor, but before long I changed my mind. He turned out to play the role well.<br/><br/>
Finally, Arnold plays the T-101 as, well, only he can. As he explains to Connor shortly after they meet, he is an entirely different machine than the one who saved Connor's bratty skin years before (in T2, Judgment Day, 1991). Unlike in T2, Connor and the T-101 in T3 never ""bond"" as they did (sort of) in T2. In fact, in T3, Connor tells the T-101 that his predecessor was the only real father figure he ever had - man, Connor led a really screwed up life!<br/><br/>Perhaps because of that, and the fact that sparks never fly between John and Kate, the movie seems mechanical. Okay, it's a movie primarily about two robots, but I'm not a robot and I want humanity for my money. The cast just seemed to be going through their parts like they were following a machine program; I kept waiting for some intensity and depth but it never arrived.<br/><br/>
The one exception is Earl Boen's reprise portrayal of Dr. Silberman, he the tormenter of Sarah Connor in T2, the psychiatrist who disbelieved her wild story and confined her to a mental institution indefinitely. But then the two terminators came to the institution, one to kill her, Arnold to save her, and Reality with a Capital R took place right before his eyes.<br/><br/>
Well, Silberman is back, and the few minutes his role takes are nearly worth the price of admission by themselves.<br/><br/>Overall, I give T3 six bags of popcorn out of 10, but I give it that many mainly because I really liked the other two, and I like Arnold as well. Otherwise, the whole movie cries out Marlon Brando's famous line in On the Waterfront: ""I coulda been a contendah!"" So close, and yet so far."

","I was very impressed with T3.  It is definitely better than T2, and quite possibly even better than the original Terminator.  Of the many movies I've seen this summer, this was by far the best: it is the most well written, has the best action, and even contends for the best humor.  I haven't been this engaged and drawn into a movie since ""Fellowship of the Ring"" came out a year and a half ago.  The characters are very well written and acted, and the plot remained true to the first two movies.  In fact, I think that the series as a whole makes more sense now that T3 has been added to it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is comfortable with the R rating."

","Though T3 is very competent, it lacks the heart of its 2 predecessors. The film plays like a series of elaborate action scenes (all done very well), with an occasional plot twist thrown in for good measure. Arnold is Arnold, though his quips seemed forced and a bit stale. As for the rest of the cast, they give a workman like effort, yet I felt the film was a bit flat.  I don't necessarily think T3 missed James Cameron, as director Jonathan Mostow has a good eye and films his action sequences with a real amount of flair and some nice bravado.  However, it seemed more of an exercise in excess than actually adding to the terminator franchise. Ultimately the film gives good bang for the buck, but I left feeling cold and uncaring much like the title's namesake."

"carmackdaddy","Null","0","0","3 July 2003"," Not as good as T2 but better than the first
","T3 is the third best movie I've seen this summer (make that year, so far) after ""X2"" and ""The Hulk,"" both of which were separated from the rest of the summer movie flock by their unusual amounts of depth and character detail. T3 on the other hand, lacks such depth, but, really, who needs it, with Jonathan Mostow's exciting, fast-paced direction and one of Arnold's best performances he's given since... T2. Although Cameron's films were sci-fi action movies that were based on ideas and frightening social commentary, T3 is more or less, simply, a popcorn action movie that rarely stops to ask the question ""Why,"" or more importantly ""How?"". Occasionally this is distracting, and compared to T2, the storyline's twists and turns here are child's play. But the movie is directed and written with so much fun and flair, and with an experimental ""balls-out"" style of humor I found surprisingly appealing. Who could've thought Arnold's Terminator character could be so funny without losing any of its menace, mysteriousness, or power? Special thanks goes to Arnold, who's perfected these sort of movies, and director Mostow for not going too light and keeping an air of menace and doom near the unusual (yet somewhat rushed) finale. As far as cast replacements go, I thought Nick Stahl did a fine job replacing Edward Furlong as John Connor. Stahl gives the character some depth and interest that Furlong could never provide. As for Linda Hamilton, the movie gives us a rational explanation for her departure and I really didn't miss her all that much. This is John's story, not Sarah's. Claire Danes was decent as the romantic interest, although I think we could've had a few more scenes that would've made her character seem more... important. As for the female Terminator, she's a hot babe no doubt, but nowhere near the menace of Robert Patrick's T-1000 or Arnold's earlier evil Terminator, but she makes a good match for Arnold and certainly raises some eyebrows. Overall, T3 would probably have been better with Cameron's touch, but I think Mostow did an excellent job with it, I haven't had this much true FUN at the movies in a while, and I recommend you go see it if only for entertainment value. ***1/2 out of ****."
"cyberspain","Null","0","0","3 July 2003"," Rise of the Cash Machines
","After viewing The Matrix Reloaded I overheard someone saying they liked the film but that there was too much talking.  Sounds like today's generation just wants their movies to be stylized video games.  Lots of action, easy to follow plots, and emotions not included.  We give you T3.  Yes, the film has tremendous action<br/><br/>sequences, lots of one line jokes and mediocre performances.  The TX is stunning as is any hot girl on the cover of the latest magazine at your local newsstand. The T-1000 on the other hand is memorable because the actor portraying him is<br/><br/>talented.  Only two things sustained this film: 1. The action (which is supplied in tons this summer on various films) 2. The first two films and their story lines. Audience wants to know what happens to these characters because the first two films made an impact; created a longing; set up a plot worth dissecting.  The T3 just threw money and ideas in the air and knew the franchise would bring in the hordes. Producers made this film, not Filmmakers (some Producers do care about film as an art, just not in this film).  Louder, Bigger, Faster doesn't necessarily mean<br/><br/>Better.  Rehash the two prior stories into one and you get Terminator 3. The end was only good because it was a given; a set up for another sequel: Rise of the Cash Machines.  In the end it is only a movie and it is only money.  If we don't value money then we don't value what we buy with it.  If we don't expect a good film then we settle for ordinary, something to pass the time.  Time, something else we must not value when wasted on formulaic, predictable, and uneventful films.  I expect more, my time is precious and I work hard for my money.  Therefore I will invest it into DVD's of films of an earlier more creative era.  I'll start by watching The Terminator and then follow that with T2.  I know for sure that they stand the test of time.  Wonder if T3 will too?"
"Quietman77","7","0","0","3 July 2003"," Worth Seeing - Could have been better.
","I'll try my best to keep this spoiler free:<br/><br/>THE GOOD: The two terminators - Arnold knows exactly how to play this character. He manages to make Terminator likeable, even amusing. (Why not? Everyone knows ahead of time that he's a hero.) Still, he never lets us forget that he's a super-badass killing machine. Pretty good trick for a guy in his mid 50s :)<br/><br/>Kristanna Loken, while not quite as menacing as Robert Patrick was in T2 (Who is?), nevertheless does a fine job. She is extremely sexy, and yet, I never took her lightly. Also, I enjoyed those little bits of emotion that the director allows her show. I've been waiting a long time for a Terminator that actually ENJOYS killing, and can get excited at the prospect of finding an unexpected target.<br/><br/>The T-X is a great concept... in theory. Combining both of the previous variants (T-1000-ish shapeshifting metal, covering an armed-to-the-teeth skeleton) is a logical extrapolation of the idea, and COULD have made her the most frightening Terminator yet.<br/><br/>The action scenes involving Terminator and/or T-X were outstanding. Terrific fight scenes, particularly the ""bathroom"" fight, and the end of the truck-vs.-mobile-crane chase scene.<br/><br/>There are a few parts of the movie that genuinely surprised me. I honestly didn't see the ending coming. (In hindsight, I should have.) Also, the explanation of how this particular Terminator came into the the human resistance's possession... Without spoiling anything, let's just say that it was quite chilling.<br/><br/>THE ADEQUATE: This may be a matter of opinion, but I thought the T-X died a little too quickly and too easily, particularly for such potent villain.<br/><br/>The human leads - John Connor (Nick Stahl), Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), General Brewster (David Andrews), etc. were OK, but that's all they were. None of them were able to dominate a scene like Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). These humans NEEDED Arnold on their side to make them interesting.<br/><br/>It's the script's fault, not Nick Stahl's, but I'd hoped for more, much much more, from John Connor. In T2, Sarah Connor was absolutely larger-than-life (albeit insane); I could easily imagine Skynet fearing her. In this movie, we only see faint glimpses of that from John Connor, and IMHO that wasn't enough.<br/><br/>The action scenes that didn't include either Terminator or T-X were relatively weak. Not horrible, but not particularly memorable either.<br/><br/>The film is generally lighter than the previous two, both literally and figuratively. Fewer critical scenes took place at night, and there was more humor. This is both good and bad. The jokes generally worked, thanks largely to Arnold's deadpan delivery, and this movie didn't look or feel like a carbon copy of the previous two, as it easily could have. Still, much of the sense of urgency was lost.<br/><br/>THE BAD: The T-X's capabilities, in practice, were inconsistently written, and sometimes distracted from the story. For example, how can she remotely drive four cars? Even if she is a super-whiz-bang computer, something in the cars has to physically push the pedals and turn the steering wheels.<br/><br/>How can she ""infect"" a computer system that doesn't have any modems or interfaces? I think Arnold says something about ""nanotechnology"" but that drifts a little too far into technobabble.<br/><br/>How does T-X mimic complex machines? Sure, I can imagine her having a blaster and a few critical power tools stored in her skeleton. However, I simply cannot accept her being able to turn her limbs into flame throwers, complicated gizmos, etc.<br/><br/>I'll usually overlook technical details (these are just movies), but not when those details make it difficult for me to suspend my disbelief. Furthermore, none of those capabilities helped to advance the plot in any meaningful way; all could easily have been been written out. The basic concept behind the T-X is more than adequate, without resorting to magic tricks.<br/><br/>Additionally, as other reviewers have mentioned, there are significant plot holes. I won't repeat or describe them here, since they'd be spoilers, but holes do exist. I'm anxious to see the deleted scenes when this movie comes out on DVD; It might help to explain things a bit better.<br/><br/>Finally, as others have said, Linda Hamilton is sorely missed. I don't know why she wasn't included in T3, but hope that the choice was hers, and hers alone. If the producers didn't want her, or if they decided that her asking price was too high, bad call.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: I enjoyed T3, I'm glad I saw it, and I'll see it again. However I'll probably wait until it makes it's way to a second-run theater (ie. reduced ticket price). Once at full price is enough.<br/><br/>Bottom line - Terminator and T2 were two of the all-time great movies. T3 was a very good popcorn movie (particularly during this very disappointing year) but it lacked greatness."

And I was NOT disappointed at all; this movie was one of my top ten movie experiences. The movie had incredible special effects, as you would expect, without being over the top to the point of disbelief. The action was non-stop, realistic, and supported the movie. There were no useless action scenes, just to have action. The acting wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, in fact I thought it was well acted. Being an action movie there wasn't a lot of dialog but when there was the actors sold their parts very well. Overall, I would say this is a great flic, worth the price of admission, and something that I will see again in the theater. I highly recommend it. 9\10"

"djmarkmadness","7","0","0","3 July 2003"," A worthy sequel to a winding down franchise.
","CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS I expected to go to this movie and be extremely disappointed with it. The original director/writer James Cameron was missing, Arnold was getting caught up by his age, and it's been over a decade since T2. Instead I was actually quite satisfied with Jonathan Mostows take on Terminator.<br/><br/>I thought that the character acting was quite well done. Nick Stahl wasn't exactly powerful with his performance as John Connor but this was a good thing because it seemed that the focus of the film was no longer on him anyways. Claire Danes while making a wonderful damsel in distress didn't really convince me that she was to be a key lieutenant of the future but I guess that's how Linda Hamilton's character was in the first film so it's all the more intriguing. Arnold's performance was of course perfect. He easily recaptured the Terminator persona and was even able to pull off some good humor with a straight face. Kristanna Loken's terminator did her job but wasn't really as intimidating as the original T-800 or the T-1000. Maybe because it was a woman this time I don't know. It's most likely the fact that I had the phrase ""been there done that"" echoing in my head since we all knew Arnold would win in the end.<br/><br/>The plot was probably the weakest category of this film. Unlike T2 there wasn't really any good sub-plot to keep the viewer intrigued between explosions. However luckily the key pressure points and a surprise twist ending kept things interesting. Some claim this is just a rip-off of movies like the Matrix because it involves computers taking over the world. Those hippie Matrix fan boys should not be listened to since this has been the key concept for the last 19 years of the franchise!<br/><br/>As for the action, some may complain it's pretty much the same as T2. Why is this a bad thing!? The chase scene alone was enough to give any action fan their fix. Anyone who says otherwise probably doesn't believe the phrase ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""<br/><br/>Overall, I definitely recommend this film. Though not as strong as the first two films, it still kept the Terminator franchise on its feet and had decent entertainment value. It could have been worse and completely spoil the series like a certain three prequel films from a certain popular space fighting franchise from far, far away. If this is the last film, it didn't end with a bang but with a solid satisfying march out the door. If T4 is made then at least T3 held the bridge up instead of letting it crash down. 3 out of 5."
"cantthinkofanid","7","0","0","3 July 2003"," it all depends on what you were expecting
","ok, so we all love T2, and the original was ok, but I think there is something to be said for the new installment of the terminator series.<br/><br/>
I'm going to start off by saying that I Hate CG, but the makers of T3 used it very well in most scenes, some times i even wondered if i was watching something real, or a cartoon, and other times it was obvious, but that's not the point. it's still 12 times better than a certain star wars that will remain nameless.<br/><br/>the only thing i'm wondering about is why they couldn't get Edward Furlong to play the older John Conner. Nick Stahl (who inherited the role) does a close to awful job as the main character, next to Claire Daines, who actually does pretty well with the part she's given. Arnold returns as the Title role; he's been doing the part for so long that i think he's finally got it down.<br/><br/>like 7 out of 9 movies playing at the theatre right now, T3 is a sequel or a remake. one of the big problems with making a sequel or a remake is that the film makers feel as though they must pay homage to the orginals, with things that turn out no better that a pun. i feel that the movie was a little caught up in it's sequel-ness; with lines like ""she'll be back."" and other scenes that were remeniscent of the first 2.<br/><br/>I give it a C- maybe a C. for an action movie, it was ok. for a sequel it was good. acting was pretty bad, but i can over look that. to come up with the final grade."

Also, there was way too much product placement.  The magic of the first two is gone forever.  The Terminator series has turned into predictable Hollywood crap.  While I wasn't crazy about the softening up and kid-friendliness of Arnold in T2, the intensity and energy of that film was undeniable and kept you at the edge of your seat.  This element was absent in T3.  Stahl and Clair Danes just didn't contribute enough of an emotional element to carry the story. T1 was a landmark in action/sci fi films.  T3 is just typical Hollywood. I have to hand it to James Cameron.  He jumped off this sinking ship just in time.

If this make 300 million plus world wide that means look for Terminator 4 sometime soon.<br/><br/>Movie includes 1. One of the top 5 car chase sceans of all time!! 2. Best Destruction from Nuculear war visuals. 3. One of the top 5 scenes at skynet. 4. One of the best cliff hanger endings!! So dont listen to any crap review you might read or think this film might be a let down and go out to a theatre and watch and be amazed again!!!!!!"
"RustyShackleworth","9","0","0","3 July 2003"," Wow! Much better than I expected, good film!
","I went to see T3 with moderate expectations but halfway through the film I found myself really impressed with the third Terminator film.<br/><br/>As expected, T3 has lots of action but much of it is done well in conveying the story.  There is an especially intense vehicle chase and it's been a while since I've watch one on film that didn't bore me to some extent. I've read some reviews that complained that T3 didn't show off a lot of special effects and seemed-scaled back.  This is not the case of all.  One of the good things about T3 is that it doesn't bombard you with lots of CGI and other effects.  And some of the effects here are quite impressive.<br/><br/>T3 also has quite a bit of humor especially in the first half of the film. I wasn't expecting this as much but it was fun and it did a good job of balancing against action.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is perhaps the best asset.  It stays true to the first Terminator film and leaves you thinking about dangers technology going amok and the value of life.<br/><br/>T3 is more a enjoyable action, sci-fi film than the Matrix Reloaded and in many ways better than T2."

","I've seen mixed reviews everywhere, and understandably so.  This is perhaps one of the most hyped-films of the year (right next to Hulk and Return of the King), and quite a few less-than-promising factors involved (no James Cameron, no Sarah Connor).<br/><br/>But let's get to the point:  Was it a great action flick?  Absolutely. Does it make significant headway into the SkyNet storyline?  Definitely?  Did the audience cheer?  Oh yes.<br/><br/>Nit-picky details aside, this movie continued to build, build, build (in a wonderful array of action sequences than truly put you in the seat of danger, and in developing the new characters).  It climaxes with the inevitable activation of SkyNet, and leaves you wanting more in the end.<br/><br/>Great movie.  Perhaps I am not a professional reviewer, but I am anxiously anticipating T4."

","I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but since it is the third in the list of ""Parts"", then it had to suffer the inevitable problem of having the plot already explained in the previous movies.  Other than that, it was a rollercoaster ride, and it could have used Camerins magical touch and more plot.  It was mostly a wow factor movie."

","With little hype and a bad promotional campaign, I expected a jank movie...boy, was I wrong. The special effects are amazing, the TX is 100% bad-ass and the fight scenes are drool-worthy. I even thought the story was well written (for an action movie). I consider this a worthy follow-up."
"J. Ryan","6","0","0","6 July 2003"," Saved by the Story. James Cameron, where are you?
","T3 suffers from the ""Matrix Syndrome,"" the need to outdue and surpass its predecessors with bigger, bolder, more blast-worthy action.  Chases and nitroglycerine abound in this film as characterization is pushed to the background.<br/><br/>To be fair, very little characterization is needed except for the Claire Danes character.  Unless you've been living in an isolated commune for the past 20 years, you know the Terminator.  Arnold's persona has become pop culture myth -- like the Six Million Dollar Man writ large.  Stahl's character, John Connor, is still the ordinary man tormented by his awesome destiny.<br/><br/>T3 does deliver the stunts, the explosions, even the catchy one-liners to which we've become accustomed.  Arnold's performance is stellar.  His charm breathes humanity into an automaton (Gov. Schwarzenegger one day perhaps?). Stahl is competent, while Danes is immeasurably underused.  Note her role as Juliet in Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet -- but hey, this isn't Henry James. Kristanna Loken is good as well, sexily exuding VERY homicidal tendencies.<br/><br/>Yet beyond the action, T3 main point of interest is the story.  While the first 2 films touch upon existentialism and self-determination (""There's no fate but what you make"" is a recurring theme), this film does a 180 and focuses on destiny.  The ending is intriguing, a little 12 Monkeys-que, and certainly depressing.<br/><br/>I agree with Roger Ebert in saying that T3 is really a dumbed down version of its history.  Were it not for the creative ending, I probably wouldn't have been as impressed.  That said, T3 is a worthy addition to the franchise."

","This the best Terminator movie. <br/><br/>The action and movement of the movie is excellent. There are a<br/><br/>few mistakes and maybe some liberty is taken with some of the<br/><br/>action, but they do not take anything from the chase or the fights. I<br/><br/>still don't understand the scene with the magnetic field, but will try<br/><br/>to stretch my imagination still a little more to make sense of it. <br/><br/>
Arnold is not as impressive looking as he was in the earlier<br/><br/>movies, but he still has muscles even if they may not be as big as<br/><br/>they used to be.

Arnold did not seem to<br/><br/>have any new quotes, but I got the feeling this will be the last time<br/><br/>we will see this version of the Terminator.

","At last! the return of an outrageous, rambunctious, tightly paced and funny adventure flick that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't mind being a self-parody.<br/><br/>I am so grateful that T3 does not get bogged down with the hokey mysticism of the new `Star Was' trilogy, the pseudo-techno babble of `The Matrix', and the sappy self-indulgent New Age-ism of the ""Star Trek"" series.<br/><br/>
It's just a good old beat-em-up, shoot-em-up yarn with a simple theme: artificial intelligent machines hate us and they're relentlessly bent on killing us. Period. <br/><br/>Without getting itself sidetracked on boring detail, this trilogy finally acknowledges that the past can't be changed. All the characters are trapped in a time-paradox -- something awkwardly glossed-over in the dismal `Time Machine' remake.<br/><br/>Arnold will go down in history as making more money per spoken word than any actor since silent films. His one-liners are devastating.  What more does a robot have to say? The choice of a female Terminator was inevitable, and pretty Kristanna Loken really plays it straight with a chilling determination."

","This movie was entertaining.  It was not a SUPER GOOD action movie though. There were a lot of good points.  I didn't mind that kid who played John Conner.  I don't think he looked like Reese at all.  I did like the way he stayed STRONG even when the CHIPS were down.  What I did like about this movie was that ARNOLD didn't seem to need any steroids.  He still looks STRONG and said he worked out for THREE hours a day to TRAIN for this movie. That's odd, considering that he was only exposed for 30 seconds with no SHIRT.  However, since it's Arnold, I don't mind.  What I hated, was that Arnold didn't ask for himself to be made a better CYBORG.  If he is a TIME TRAVELER, he could have gone way forward into time and asked for the scientists to make him STRONGER so that he could beat the Terminatrix.  That was a HUGE flaw in the movie.   The OTHER flaw was CLAIR DAINES.  Is she supposed to marry JOHN CONNER and HAVE KIDS?  I hate to say it, but Reese already had a child with Sarah Conner.  The odds of a child being produced after a NUCLEAR WAR are very minimal.  The fallout alone would KILL all the reproductive organs.  I was SHOCKED to see how much Clair Daines has AGED. She AGED very well though.  It was EXACTLY LIKE Linda Hamilton when she became angry with the Terminatrix.    What about where Arnold carried a coffin?  Did you find it STRANGE that the bullets didn't penetrate his LEATHER JACKET?  That was not well thought out.   Also, when The Terminatrix was attracted to a LARGE MAGNET, she got a circular saw out and SAWED the magnetic tube.  The tube would have been so MAGNETICALLY strong, that the circular saw would not have worked!!  Why didn't they show how she got out of that PREDICAMENT?  I found it strange that Termintrix was able to drive that CRANE as long as she did.  I have seen CRANES and they don't go that fast.  They also do NOT have the power to go through as many buildings as it did.  The Terminator girl was good though.  She could have become invisible and been way more effective.  If she has the ability to copy anybody, she should copy INVISIBLE,,,,that would have been the way to go.  Sure, a few flaws in this movie, but ARNOLD delivered a few good lines and the best line was when he said ""DON'T DO THAT"".  What I am wondering, is who will play JOHN CONNER in the next TERMINATOR?  My money is on Rick Schroeder or Paul Reiser.  Noodle Juice man would be good. also."
"John-423","5","0","0","6 July 2003"," A Unworthy and less than stellar ""comedy""... Not The REAL Terminator.
","You know in the last 10 years American film making has suffered horribly in the way that it plays up movie clichés, and things that are perceived as comic relief, this film serves as a prime example of how to take a no brainer and mock what you are actually trying to accomplish. The first problem comes in that Arnold is no longer just a caricature of himself in the publics minds, but now he's a caricature of that caricature in the movie itself if that makes any sense. Having him spout off one liners just for the sake of one liners is really sad, and unlike the typical ""comic relief"" that pollutes films now days its was way overdone in the first hour or so almost to the point I was feeling embarrassed as a fan of the series. It was almost like they were trying to make you forget they actually had a real struggle in the movie and that the t-850 was there to be a joke, hell if that was the case why didn't they just hire Rob Schneider as the threat? LISTEN UP HOLLYWOOD some of us LOVE these kinds of films, why ""fix"" what's not broken??? Comic relief is fine if used right, but as this film goes it was poorly wrote and badly placed. The TX or Terminatrix was pretty lame as well, but much of that had to do with the way she was shot, and not just how bad her acting was... simply put she did not come across as a cold blooded killer like Arnie or Robert Patrick did. The idea of exploiting her femininity to murder is one thing, but they way it was handled is another as the ""Victoria's secret"" scene was made for 10 year olds it would seem. Why the hell would a damn near invincible ""pull over"" for a cop anyway? That really made sense... To have a unproven like Jonathan Mostow direct in Cameron's leave is just ridiculous, the guys a damned hack pure and simple if he can ruin something so good, especially trimming the film down under 2 hours like a good ""commercial"" director. For all the negativity though I will say it had SOME redeeming things going for it, the first of which is Nick Stahl. Stahl was TREMENDOUS in the movie and in many ways the glue that held it together for the first hour, unlike the terrible actor (Edward Furlong) that portrayed him in T2, he had depth and appeal. The last 30 mins are pretty good (even if the Terminator battle was eh...) and the ending gave me chills... Too bad this film was so badly soiled by its directors hand and the poor script, it could have been great 5/10 (Mainly due to Stahl's outstanding performance)"

Yes, it did have a few good plot points and I did enjoy the subtle humouros allusions to the first two movies... especially the PTSD counsellor.<br/><br/>What didn't work for me? Arnold's obviously computer generated chest, and the LAME ending that basically says ""If you want to know the really ending to this story you have to wait for Terminator 4.""<br/><br/>The last movie that pulled this cheap shot was ""Back to the Future II.""

","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) D: Jonathan Mostow. Arnold Schwarzeneggar, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, Kristanna Loken, David Andrews, Earl Boen, Moira Harris, M.C. Gainey, Susan Merson. As it turns out, the 1997 nuclear war prevented in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY had not been prevented at all, just merely postponed. Taking place in the present day, yet another Terminator, the T-X (Loken) is sent back through time to kill the future leader of the human resistance John Connor (Stahl, filling in for the troubled Edward Furlong), as well as several other future military leaders. The long awaited TERMINATOR sequel lacks director James Cameron and stars Linda Hamilton and Furlongand it shows. Despite some great action sequences by director Mostow (who won me over with 1997's BREAKDOWN) and great special effects, the film fails to capture its audience with awe and wonder like the first two. Several twists about the actual war caused by Skynet (talked about in the first two films but never actually shown) are present here and are a neat touch. However, Loken's T-X isn't nearly as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2. Action to spare, but lacks heart and Cameron's touch. Also, the music score by Marco Baltrami just plain sucks (omitting Brad Fiedel's famous TERMINATOR theme until a lousy orchestrated version at the film's end). RATING: 7 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence, profanity, and brief nudity."
"Li-1","Null","0","0","6 July 2003"," The best of this year's summer blockbusters.
","**** out of ****<br/><br/>I feared the worst for Terminator 3.  It's premise is almost identical to T2's (Schwarzenegger Terminator heads back in time to save John Connor), the ads looked terrible, and on paper, this looked like the pitch perfect example of a popular series ruined by money-hungry studio executives.  While I have no doubt the producers of this film acted out of greed, I can safely say my fears were unfounded.  Terminator 3 is easily the summer's best pure blockbuster.<br/><br/>It's been several years since John Connor (played by Nick Stahl) helped bring down Skynet.  But he's still frightened by the possibilities of the future, so he spends his days wandering around, his identity deleted.  Two more terminators are sent back in time, the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), a new design sent to assassinate Connor and his future lieutenants.  As before, a Terminator who resembles Arnold Schwarzenegger is sent as Connor's lone protector.  Added into the crisis is Kate Brewster (Clair Danes), whose presence will play a vital role into the fate of the planet's future.<br/><br/>The possible signs of sequilitis are present here, but despite essential similarities to T2 director Jonathan Mostow crafts the movie with a look and feel that separates it from its predecessors, but does so without betraying its roots.  That's a pretty fantastic accomplishment.<br/><br/>But before I make T3 sound like nothing more than a high-gloss rip-off, the movie does deliver an engaging story filled with genuine surprises and complications.  It works as a continuation of its predecessor's legacy, and surprisingly, this addition never feels the slightest bit gratuitous.<br/><br/>
The action sequences are the movie's highlight, especially an astounding car chase that actually puts the one in The Matrix Reloaded to shame.  Expect shootouts and plenty of explosions, but delivered with flair and energy. The last half-hour is virtually non-stop action, and Mostow maintains a high pitch of intensity.  Most impressive of all is the one-on-one showdown between the Terminators, probably the most exhilarating action setpiece I've seen all year.<br/><br/>What surprised me the most was the attention paid to the characters.  Nick Stahl's portrayal of John Connor is entirely likeable and convincing, blowing all memories of Edward Furlong's annoying performance to dust. Clair Danes, who I've never been a big fan of, is also quite good as the requisite-but-not-quite love interest (I loved the twist involving her character and the Terminator).  <br/><br/>Schwarzenegger puts forth his most memorable portrayal of a Terminator, playing his role with a great sense of circumstantial humor.  T3 is packed with big laughs (the best being the sunglassses bit), thanks mostly to Schwarzenegger's sense of comic timing.  This is his comeback piece, and it's good to see the big lug back and better than ever.  As his villainous counterpart, Kristanna Loken is imposing as the Terminatrix, and bound to drive male teens crazy with her great figure (her nude scene frustratingly shows very little).<br/><br/>Terminator 3's countdown to worldwide armageddon adds a sense of desperation its predecessors were missing.  The suspenseful build-up concludes satisfyingly in an ending that actually surprised and delighted me.  Sure, the set up leaves another sequel a possibility, but I actually can't wait for a Terminator 4."
"wirestone","6","0","0","6 July 2003"," Chases and Twists
","Wonderful fight scenes - after watching The Matrix and its clones, the ""retro"" down and dirty fight style between the two cyborgs are almost refreshing. No Wired-Foo!!!<br/><br/>Wonderful chase sequences - the huge trucks and several blocks of condemned buildings being crushed look much less choreographed than the dozens of sports carts used in 007 and the recent Bond clones.<br/><br/>Good story and screenplay - even though most of the film is devoted to pure action, the actors are given enough screen time to let their characters shine through, especially Claire Danes, who did a wonderful job playing both Sarah Connors of the first two movies of the series (you will know what I mean when you see the film).<br/><br/>This is definitely not as great as the first two Terminator movies. Most actions in the first two take places during the night, and the darkness adds a much more hair-raising air. Instead, almost the entire T3 takes place during the day, and it's just not as scary, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Also, director Jonathan Mostow showcases his skill on action, but he clearly lacks the personal touch of James Cameron. Even though the T-X is more powerful than anything we've seen in most Si-Fi movies, she's just not as cold and scary as the first two assassins played by Arnold and Robert Patrick. The eyes of the first two cyborgs in T1 and T2 send chills down my spine; Christana Loken just doesn't have the feeling of a sharpened blade like her male counterparts.<br/><br/>But still it is a good movie, especially the twist at the end of the film that will force you to reflect on the world and your own life. And I must comment on the makeup artists, who has done a wonderful job make Arnold actually look much the same as in T2, more than a decade ago.<br/><br/>However, the movie left me with a bitter taste in my mouth as I leave the theatre.<br/><br/>--- S P O I L E R ---<br/><br/>The first two movies emphasizes on a single line - ""No fate but what we make"", the twist at the end, even though good for storytelling, totally negates that simple ideal. It wipes the efforts in the first two films clean and basically says that you cannot go against fate.<br/><br/>Not surprising though, as the first two films reflect on the 80's - ""you make you own fate""; whereas T3 reflects on a much more spiritual 90's - ""you cannot avoid your fate"".<br/><br/>No wonder James Cameron doesn't want to be involved with this one."

","I admit when I first heard T3 was in production I was moaning and groaning. I mean I didn't care that Cameron, Hamilton or Furlong wern't involved with the project, but I just didn't see the need for T3, it just felt like a safe bet to be a big pile of feces. This summer has been full of blockbusters that were way better than I expected them to be, X2, The Matrix Reloaded, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and Hulk were all blockbusters that were way better than I expected them to be. Now I can put Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines on that list!<br/><br/>When I saw it during a sneak preview, I knew that I wasn't going to like it as much as Terminator 2: Judgement Day, because T2 has sentimental value (it was the first R rated movie I ever saw). What I got was a fun as heck movie with killer action and a fantastic ending.<br/><br/>This film makes up for not having Edward Furlong or Linda Hamilton by having two equally if not more talented actors with Nick Stahl and Claire Danes. Both of them are very believable in their roles. Of course Arnold is perfect as the T-800 I mean it's the role he was born to play! Nobody could take this role but him, NOBODY!<br/><br/>The new villian, the T-X works half the time. Half the time Kristianna Loken plays the character with a creepy, sadistic quality, and the other half it simply looks like she is mimicking Robert Patrick's performance as the T-1000 in T2. The T-X itself is a totally cool machine idea.<br/><br/>As for the action...it will blow your mind. There is a massive car chase involving a crane which is spectacular. Then the best of the whole movie, and all out wall to wall fight between two Terminators! Watching Arnold and Kristianna throw each other around and through walls was so brutal and beautiful I was ready to give it a standing ovation. I wish we actually had cyborgs that advanced, because I want robot fighting as a sport after seeing the T-800 and T-X duke it out.<br/><br/>The thing I love most about T3 is the ending. It's a real surprise ending, that is dark, and works perfectly. I am glad James Cameron didn't direct this film, because he wouldn't have had the grapes to do this ending.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, in my opinion Terminator 3 is the surprise success of the summer. The film is better than the origional Terminator, yet not as good as Terminator 2, but still worth the price of admission. Now go out there and get terminated!"
"ilovedolby","8","0","0","6 July 2003"," `T3' is a relatively good action/science-fiction sequel that holds true to the original concepts that Cameron created.
","Twelve years ago, James Cameron released one of the most successful and visually stunning action/science fiction releases of all time-`Terminator 2: Judgment Day.' Now we have a sequel called `Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines.' It would seem like another Hollywood action extravaganza without a plot. After all, the characters in `T2' stopped Judgment Day from ever happening, so what's left? Apparently, they only postponed it. So it's once again up to the future resistance of humankind to send back a protector for John Connor and his future wife, Kate Brewster. Although the story line sounds contrived, the filmmakers came up with some good plot concepts in order to continue the series on a level of minor intelligence. The end result is less dark and less hard-core action than James Cameron's direction gave in the first two films. Nonetheless, `T3' is a worthy sequel that has some great action sequences and keeps the story believable. <br/><br/>	`T3' begins in the present day with images of John (Nick Stahl) who lives off the grid in order to keep his existence a secret. At the same time, the machine army of the future sends back a new kind of terminator, the T-X (Kristanna Loken), a female whose mission is to destroy not only John, but also his future lieutenants. As such, the human resistance sends back their own terminator, the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the model designed to protect John and his future spouse, Kate (Claire Danes). Here's the catch. Kate's father, Robert Brewster (David Andrews) is the man who heads up the computer network Skynet. But what he doesn't realize is that Skynet, a form of artificial intelligence, is becoming self-aware. In other words, as soon as Skynet is brought online, it will take over computer networks and mainframes worldwide, and the war will begin. It's now a race to stop not only the T-X from destroying the crucial members of the future human resistance, but also a race to stop Skynet from coming online.<br/><br/>	`T3' had some great action sequences. In particular, a chase scene in which the T-X tries to run down John and Kate with a huge crane truck, as the T-800 hangs on by the crane. The T-X crashes the truck into the sides of buildings and other vehicles in order to stop the terminator from saving John and Kate. As absurd as the scene is, it leads to an incredible crash that will leave one's jaw on the floor of the theater in awe.<br/><br/>	Jonathan Mostow took over the direction of `The Terminator' series, as it was the brainchild of `Titanic' director James Cameron. Mostow's credits include the heart-pounding suspense thriller `Breakdown,' and the World War II submarine flick `U-571.' Mostow's direction is not as hard edged as Cameron's was, but it is certainly respectable. Usually, as the founding filmmaker of a project leaves, the new director may ruin the legacy left by the original filmmaker-a problem that existed with `Jurassic Park III.' Steven Spielberg portrayed an image filled with suspense and intrigue into the dinosaur world created by author Micheal Crichton. However, when Joe Johnston (`October Sky') took over as the director, he created a simple, campy film that couldn't even compare to the greatness of its predecessors.<br/><br/>	It's great to see Schwarzenegger back in action, as well. He was made to be the hero in these kinds of films. And `T3' is a far cry better than his last flick, `Collateral Damage.' In the end, `T3' is a relatively good action/science-fiction sequel that holds true to the original concepts that Cameron created. ***"

","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a storyboard, not much more.  They sketched out the basic plot and brought in the artist for concepts.  The characters were drawn with colored pencils with explosions in the background with great detail.  That all translated directly to the screen.  Each character had the right look.  All of the action sequences were shot from the right angles.  But, they forgot to add the dialog that was necessary to take this from a long action sequence to a good movie.<br/><br/>What's important about the first two Terminator movies is the development of the killing machine sent back in time, the panic and fear of the one or several characters who know what the Terminator can do and the denial of those who won't believe them, and the apparent indestructability of the Terminator, until a novel strategy is employed.  This movie neglects the first two and makes it just a chase to the grand finale.  But, since you don't know the characters, except what you already know about John Connor there's more than one thing missing.<br/><br/>***********************SPOILERS*************************<br/><br/>The movie starts and the T-X begins assassinating young people throughout Los Angeles.  How much extra time would it have taken to add some police investigation of the serial murders.  What do these teenagers have in common?  Maybe something that reveals all of the teenagers will be outside the Los Angeles area within the next 48 hours.  That's integral to the long-term storyline, but it's neglected.<br/><br/>Then the T-X just shows up at the Animal Clinic where Brewster is at 5:30am. Why wouldn't she go to Brewster's home rather than the Clinic. Unexplained.  Obviously Brewster told T-101 that she would be there that night with Connor, so that makes sense.<br/><br/>There isn't the build up, like in Terminator or T-2, where the main characters are hunted by their would be mechanical assassin, and it's really necessary, not just to build tension, but also to build the character of the Terminator.  In this case, there is no personality nor inevitability of the T-X.<br/><br/>The secondary characters are also neglected.  General Brewster is hardly explained.  He doesn't want to give up control to Skynet, but why not.  Give us a little more about him, his program, his staff.  Let us connect to him a bit.  Why does he do what he does at the end?<br/><br/>Introducing Dr. Peter Silberman back into the story was a fun idea, but they really gave him nothing to work with.  That could have been much more useful.<br/><br/>In T-2 the Terminator is used well to advance the future plot and to give background to the audience through narrative about Judgment Day.  Since Brewster is a totally unknowledgeable character, such narrative would help here too, but it's only done in scant detail.  Stretching things out over several days, instead of packing everything into one could have given this freedom to advance the plot.  Adding another important character could have done this as well.  In T-2, the T-101 explains Judgment Day to Sarah Connor and Myles Bennett Dyson.  It adds weight when he tells the story twice, but differently.  The longer time period could have given more chance to advance the story that way, and it would have allowed the background police investigation I proposed above.<br/><br/>The definition of Skynet at the end doesn't make much sense at all.  Perhaps the supercomputer becomes aware and takes control of all networked systems, but for all computers to be part of it, because of software, is foolish.<br/><br/>Finally, ""I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.""  I guess the free will idea Cameron created in the first two Terminator films was thrown out with the bath water.<br/><br/>Since the film was only about 90 minutes, these things could have added flesh to the hyperalloy combat chassis without over burdening the microprocessor."

","!!! WARNING: SPOILERS !!!<br/><br/>""Terminator 3"" is not a great film, but it is a very good one.  Lacking is the intense score by Beltrami, the sense of doom and dread in every shot, and the gritty atmosphere created by James Cameron.  As a technical film, it is expertly handled.  But it is missing its artistic vision.  Jonathan Mostow is a competent (even talented) director--see ""Breakdown"" for an excellent suspense film--but he was given the task of taking care of another director's baby.<br/><br/>In trying to satisfy all the prerequisite elements of the Terminator films, he seems to have sacrificed the essence of them.  They're gritty, violent, doom-filled stories about the end of the world.  ""Terminator 3"" occasionally achieves that sense of defeat, particularly in the final ten minutes.  But with all the mayhem and action sequences, there doesn't seem to be an urgency about them.  It's an excellent summer flick, but don't expect the kind of grandeur that the first two films exhibited.<br/><br/>With that being said, ""Terminator 3"" almost seemed essential (and makes me wonder why James Cameron didn't want to make it).  If, as James Cameron's films stated, John Connor sent his own father back in time to protect his mother, he would not exist if Judgment Day did not occur.  This makes for a paradox--how can someone exist if their father is from the future?  The future must be set, and if the future is set, what we decide can't change it.  It could take hundreds of films to adequately deal with the implications here.  <br/><br/>An episode of ""The Outer Limits"" dealt with this nicely--a woman changed her life by going back in time and ""correcting"" all the problems.  Every time she came back, her brain was forced with another lifetime of memories.  If you've fixed all the problems in your past, there is no reason for you to go back in time.  Your present would be altered without repair.<br/><br/>In all actuality, there could be no movie about the events portrayed in the ""Terminator"" films.  Granted, this is taking it way beyond the sci-fi roots and trying to ground the films far too much in reality.  But hypothetically speaking, the moment a robot is sent from the future, everything would change.  If a robot was sent to the past, and it was meant to destroy a certain person, then its very existence proves its failure inevitable.  If it did succeed in killing a particular person, then the moment it arrives in the past, it would vanish--there would be no need for this robot to be sent back in time to kill that person.  Seeing as how killing the person would alter the future, why would they need to send a robot back?  How could the future be dead-set if it can be changed so simply?  Something not dealt with in time travel films--how does time travel affect the past and present as well?  If you send a terminator back, and they complete their mission, your present is no longer the same, you would not have to send a machine back in time to kill that person--they'd be dead from the previous timeline.  So there must be infinite timelines--and time travel would simply be traveling from one version of time to another.  The theories of time travel really give me a headache if I think too deeply about them.<br/><br/>Another thought: sending something back in time is probably an impossible task.  It is well beyond the limits of my own mind.  If you send someone back in time, it is the present to everyone else.  This would mean to those people that the future is set, that it has already occurred. <br/><br/>
""Terminator 3"" deals with all of this, though hidden beneath layers.  You have to dig to figure it out--it doesn't tell you everything.  That's one of the impressive traits of Mostow's film.  The script smartly gives us the questions, but lets us delve into them.  If John Connor is killed by one of the Terminators, then the future is changed, and John Connor can not send his own father back to protect his mother.  Talk about your mind-warps!<br/><br/>While this is merely just scratching the surface of the paradoxes time travel theory creates, it is after all, just a movie.  ""Terminator 3"" has a decent cast (Kristanna Loken leaves a bit to be desired, although she acts about as much like a killing robot as I would expect one to act), a well-written script, and a talented director.  The action is above par, and sometimes downright brutal.  Best yet, the ending is a downer, a surprise that caught me off guard.  That a big-budget film would attempt such an ending (and intelligently deal with it) makes me feel a little more generous with my rating of the film.  All in all, I recommend this one as a good continuation of James Cameron's imaginative story, although lacking his artistic creativity.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 stars out of 4 (*** out of ****)"

","***Minor Spoilers***  <br/><br/>While watching T3, one cannot help but notice the lack of Jim Cameron's unique touch to the film.  The movie does not feel the same as its predecessor's.  That being said, T3 is still a great action movie and does much to move the series ahead.  I love the fact that Arnold has to start over with the Terminator character.  He does not have the polished interaction with humans that John taught him in T2 and John even comments on that in the film.  The movie also attempts to tie up many of the loose ends left by the first two films when it comes to the whole time travel timeline paradox thing.  It dives right into the idea of fate and how the previous excursions into the past in the first two movies only served to postpone Judgment Day, not stop it.  They threw a few things in about how things got screwed up by Kyle in T1 and the Terminator in T2.  Mostow does an excellent job taking over an established franchise.  The film does not have the same frenetic style and suspense of the first two, but was well written and directed.  While the first two were both groundbreaking films, this movie does not have anything you have not seen before, but does have something the other two lacked, a raw human element contained in action sequences that are toned down to a more realistic level.  This film definitely moves the series along and will stand out as a great movie if it is used as a transition into a film that deals with the future and the war against the machines.  If it is the last in the series, it will be a great end, not spectacular, but solid and well made.  I liked it and I think most Terminator fans will be satisfied.  Surely, what we will need is a mind-blowing 4th film that does contain something we have never seen before, but enjoy this one while it's here."

"StarCastle99","Null","0","0","5 July 2003"," A Great Ride but T-2 is still the one to beat
","Science Fiction like Jello comes in many flavors. T-1 was an amazing film in that it looked like five times the budget. T-2 set new standards in Special Effects and a time travel narrative that eluded to quantum time theory (that is the future doesn't exist, we create it millisecond by millisecond). Both films featured great action set pieces. T-3 is a wonderful way to spend 109 minutes (thank goodness it was no three hour LOTR). It's a bit dumbed down, the film makers knew their demographics and didn't try to over-reach. If you like the other Terminators, you'll totally enjoy this one. Arnold is, well, Arnold. He is a one of a kind and all the others are pretenders. I know the man personally. He is as intelligent and thoughtful an individual as you will ever meet. But no one wants to see that Arnold on the screen. They want ""I'll be baaack"". Yesterday I watched the first two films to prepare me for this one. I knew what to expect. I wasn't disappointed. If there is a 4th sequel don't expect Arnold to be in it. At 55 he's in the words of Danny Glover: ""Too old for this ----."" The other players are adequate, but no one ever gets as passionate as Linda Hamilton in T-2. SPFX were excellent, they've had 12 years to benefit from five new generations of CGI equipment. My advice. Go see it. It's great fun. Please don't take it seriously, the cast doesn't. The only one's who do are the bean counters at the studio, and with $175 million dollar budget who can blame them. 7.9/10"

","Having seen The Matrix, X2, and the Hulk, I can honestly say that I liked T3 the best of all of them. Lots of action, humor and a good story that doesn't feel contrived.<br/><br/>That being said, how does it stack up to T1 and T2? It's hard to say. The first two films definitley have a different look and feel to them. This one seemed more flatly shot and less atmospheric. T2 was such a mind-blowing surprise when it came out that everything before it was blown out of the water, and it has become the benchmark for everything since. Because there are so few surprises left for movies to offer, this doesn't give you that sense of awe, like you're seeing something for the first time.<br/><br/>
It does, however, give you old school action by the bucketload. Cars, buildings and bathroom stalls (you'll see) explode with such reckless abandon that you can't help but enjoy it. And just when it begins to become too much - the story takes a twist and sucks you in. Also, Arnold looks better than he has in years and its great to see him back in his signature role.<br/><br/>Some have said the ending is a letdown. I disagree. Though it may be understated, I think it's the best ending of a movie in a very long time. It doesn't cop out, and leaves you wanting more.<br/><br/>Overall, very entertaining. Arnold's best since the last one."
"The_Core","7","0","0","5 July 2003"," Lives up to the series, lacks suspense...
","""T3: Rise of the Machines"" had some serious living up to do as far as the first two films are concerned.  In my opinion it doesn't disgrace the series, especially in terms of pure action.  However, it is the weakest of the three in terms of both story and sci-fi.<br/><br/>The film, like many other movies with a lot of ""over-the-top"" action, suffers from a curious lack of suspense.  Not that suspense was completely absent, but it takes a strong, coherent story along with powerful acting and believable plot to support a film with this much 'in your face' action, and the film doesn't have it.  Ultimately, nothing much happens, and none of the characters are terribly likeable.  I didn't care too much about what happened to them, in stark contrast to the first two films -- I never felt they were really in any serious danger.  The humor was nice (it really was funny) but always seemed to come at a time when we should have been concerned for the fate of the characters instead.<br/><br/>** A few spoilers **<br/><br/>I also have issues with the Terminatrix, who displayed a lot of unevenness as far as her abilities go... in the scenes just before she's terminated (am I really spoiling anything?) she looks a lot like an advanced T-101, with parts hanging off everywhere -- yet in the rest of the film it's suggested she's at least as advanced as the ""bad"" terminator in T2, which was made of liquid metal.  In terms of Skynet, the idea that the system has no central core and is distributed ""over the Internet"" is both good and bad.. it makes sense to us, yet it's cliched and silly too (and science-wise, downright impossible).<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie greatly.  I was greatly entertained by the action, yet afterward the film just felt kind of hollow and vanished from my mind rather quickly... nothing all too memorable ever happened, and I really feel this movie is ultimately another forgettable summer actioner that will be OK released as a series of DVD's with the first two films, but just doesn't stand up alone as a terribly worthy addition to the Terminator franchise.<br/><br/>By far the weakest of the Terminator series (except for the action, which was great, maybe too great)... 7/10."

","The third installment of the Terminator saga, is awesome on it's own merit. Even though James Cameron wasn't on board for this one, it works well as the third film in the series. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the Terminator sent back in time, Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong as the older John Connor, and new edition Claire Danes joins the ensemble. Kristanna Loken plays the T-X: a female terminator who, believe it or not, is far better than Robert Patrick's T-1000 from the previous film. Director Jonathan Mostow(U-571 and Breakdown) adds a slightly different feel to this installment, often poking fun at the franchise, and topping the previous film in special effects and action sequences. The benefit of this film is that it has been twelve years since T2 and the production technology has improved since then, so there was much more that could be done this time around. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines isn't just a summer money-maker, there are also a few valid plot lines that are now introduced, which  hint the possibility of a fourth film. James Cameron may be the creator and Terminator god, but Mostow does a pretty good job of keeping the franchise alive."

The ending lacks the ""feel good"" sense of the last two, if you can call it that.

There is, however, much more story to be told- maybe in T4? Anyway, vis: the ending, some people will complain but I loved it. It made perfect sense!  And it doesn't kill the franchise!

","Terminator 3 lives up to its predeccesors in respect to its action sequences and to some extent acting. However it's the story line which suffers, and is not developed in T3. The films fails to link the new aspects of what is going on with the other 2 films, mainly because the creator of the first two did not even envision a third. This time the plot concerns John Conner (Nick Stahl) more than it does the Terminator (Sharzenegger) and Conner with the help of the Terminator has to stay alive in order to save the human race on judgement day. Meanwhile a new terminator, Tx is after him to kill him, played by Kristanna Loken. Loken brings much sex appeal and hype to the role, but one can question how believable she actually is a dangerous terminator. Stahl does fairly well in his role, Shwarzenneger is pretty good reprising his role and is very comedic in some instances. Claire Danes probably gives the best performance of the film. The rest do not really matter to the plot except for Kristanna Loken who had little to say and was not the best actress for the role, although she definetely had screen presence.

","How can I put it.  After having watched the film on preview night, I couldn't help to observe that the film was a mixture of both previous films, as far as style, action, comedy, and small elements that distinguish both movies apart.  I knew that I wouldn't be seeing something directed by James Cameron so I was prepared for the absolute worst.  John Mostow has come through, period.  In a year of watching over the top action movies that somehow don't seem believable (ex. Charlies Angels, The Matrix) with really loud abonoxious music instead of a good score, this movie for some weird reason is believable.  As funny as it sounds, it does have alot action, but it doesn't feel over the top with super karate kicks or superhuman moves. Since the movie gives a sense that it really can happen, it's a story line that can be believable.  I'm not going to elaborate on the acting since all you need to know is that Nick Stahl (John Conner) is better than Furlong, Claire Danes does a solid job as a replacement for Sarah Conner, and Arnold is Arnold.  For those people that have voiced complaints that say Arnolds heart is not in this role aren't doing their homework.  Arnold CAN'T BE the same terminator from the last film.  Arnold in this film is a different terminator, but the same model!  If he acted like the previous terminator, then that wouldn't make sense would it.  Arnold came into this film knowing that this terminator had to act differently, so he chose to play a slightly more stoic and darker model.  The pace and look of the film is like T1, with the special effects of T2.  A big thanks to John Mostow for not butchering the film like another director might have, and to Kristina Loken for doing a wonderful job as the T-X.  Go see this movie, now."

I can see why so many people were a bit disappointed that it was more of a B-movie than a mainstream action film.  Perhaps they're right, but that's not what makes a movie good, even though it may do poorly in the box-office. But I do defend this film based on the ending of it, which goes back to the origins of the series.<br/><br/>In itself, this movie was entirely a push to the end to see how Judgment Day actually arrived and there was actually wit on why (little on that later). The action scenes were some of the best I've seen in a summer action movie, even though it was a B-movie.  But the opening sequences were overkill; not even James Cameron made the destruction that long.  Also, the score by Marco Beltrami was nearly non-existent so that made the movie seem like a stunt show than a tense action thriller, even though some were notable (like the Terminator going through a building while holding to the crane).  From the opening credits, it really did feel like a B-movie because there was not one iota of a special effect, nothing (so I guess the $175 million was really spent on blowing stuff up).  The T-X moved like a mannequin doll (which I guess why she arrived in a women's department store with all the mannequin model); there was nothing new or revolutionizing of the model, jut more of a super-advance T-1000.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was not the star of the show but more of a supporting cast member (Nick Stahl and Claire Danes were the real stars).<br/><br/>Even though the story did seem like it took a back seat, there was some actual wit.  For example the T-X hunting down John Connor's ""lieutenants"" that worked in fast food stores and having parties while mom is away (or dead); they would have been great assests to John Connor for the future war. Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) would be John's wife and would also have a significant role for the resistance; I really did like their chemistry. And the most twisted side of it all was the fact that Skynet was never really a system to which Connor thought it was; it was actually a network, which means it was DECENTRALIZED, which meant that there was no hierarchy controlling it.  Hence the term Sky(network), just like the Internet.<br/><br/>
Why am I defending this movie?  If John Connor in the future cannot send his father back in time if there was no judgement day, how could John have existed in the first place?  I was reminded of ""12 Monkeys.""  Granted it could have down a better job with the storyline, but I see why this movie ""had"" to be made.<br/><br/>I give this movie 7.5 out of 10 stars.

There are several places where the movie pokes fun at itself and its predessesors and hey, it makes it that much more fun.  (Come on, you know it had to be a little cheesy.)  For those who want a summary, basicly Judgment Day was only postponed in T2 and the machines, giving up on killing John Conner, have targeted several of his to-be leiutenants by sending back the Terminatrix whose exact model number escapes me at the moment.  Of course, good old Arnie is sent back to stop her and the film gives a good explaination as to why the human resistance would keep sending back this inferior model of Terminator while the machines continue to upgrade.  The end of T3 made the movie completely worthwhile for me.  I don't want to give anything away, but it's not often I applaud a Hollywood film in its writing efforts these days.  The only real problem I had with the movie is that John wasn't played by Ed Furlong, not that Im a huge Furlong fan, but I'm a big fan of continuity... yeah, nitpicky, I know.  Overall, I was very pleased with T3 and look forward to the inevitable T4."

","There were lots of good things about the movie.  I liked the new villain, Kristanna Loken.  Nick Stahl and Claire Danes were good, and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger was on top of his game.  <br/><br/>But the ending didn't seem to fit.  It was like they were filming one day and the director was told he only had five minutes to wrap up filming, so he threw something together.  It's the same feeling I got at the end of Primary Colors (John Travolta as a presidential candidate who was obviously modeled after Bill Clinton)."

","As has been said time and time again, I went in with a low expectation, and came out blown away by how good of an action film this was.<br/><br/> I could go into a detailed commentary on the film, but instead I think I'll just make a few points.<br/><br/> The comedy was definately over the top at times.  Frankly I loved it.<br/><br/> Some have critiqued the TX's design as being more primitive than that of the T1000.  These people may be forgetting the T1000's drawback.  The T1000 can not transform itself into a weapon.  It can't form projectile weapons out of itself.  By combining the liquid metal with an android skeleton, we come up with an interesting mix.  It can repair itself in the manner of the T1000, albeit it with some limitations.  However, it gains the ability to create weapons out of itself.  That arm cannon was absurdly powerful.  The flamethrower was a tad weak I'll admit, but that was a secondary attack.<br/><br/> Something I want to note that I don't think many people pick up on in T2. When Arnold is lowered into the molten steel, the chip and arm from the first movie were destroyed.  Interestingly though, when Arnold was lowered, he had one arm.  The other arm was ripped off by a gear.  That arm was left behind, in the gear.  This is just a theory of mine, but I always wondered what happened to that arm.  Interestingly, on the general's desk we find a metal Terminator hand.  Could there be a connection here?<br/><br/> I did want to briefly comment on the death of Sara Connor's dream that the future is something we can create out of free willed choice, and not deterministic.  It's sad to think that everything is predestined to happen in a certain way.  I hope in the next installment of this franchise, which now seems to be a certainty, that they find a way to return free will to the story.<br/><br/> The idea of Skynet being software as opposed to some sort of mainframe was very intriguing.  It makes the reference to Pandora's Box by the general much more compelling.  There was literally no way to put Skynet back in the box after it was unleashed.  There are several versions of the Pandora's Box myth.  In one version, only one virtue is left within the box, without which humanity would surely have been crushed by all the evils it had unleashed. Hope.  Hope here is personified in the form of John Connor and Kate Brewster.<br/><br/> I'd give this film.. oh.. 4.5/5."

"JAKastner","8","0","0","4 July 2003"," The Moose Hole - Terminator Rises Again
","Let's say you're an average Joe. You have your favorite sports car, a fabulous job, your own house, a beautiful wife and a great family. You go through life without a care in the world. But these things won't last. Why? Judgment Day. Imagine a world of complete darkness where man's destiny is controlled by machines and super computers. Sound familiar? It should because this is the backdrop of the entire Terminator series. The original Terminator cost an estimated $7 million but went on to gross $40 million at the box office. It became so popular on video that Terminator 2: Judgment Day was created, helmed by James Cameron. With a production budget of $100 million, T2 went on to gross $204 million, so it was a no brainer to make another sequel, right? Well, it took them 12 years and a reported $175 million budget but T3 has finally arrived in theaters just in time for the 4th of July holiday. But will Rise of the Machines continue the success of the popular franchise or will this result in its fall?<br/><br/>The story goes that the life of John Connor, the leader of the resistance movement that defeats the machines, is in danger once again. But this time he is not the only target. A T-X Terminator, the most advanced killing machine created by the Skynet network, has been sent to the year 2001 to kill the lieutenants of the future human resistance as well as John Connor himself. But John will be harder to locate because he has been living off the grid for nearly ten years. By having no cell phone, no home, and no real identity, the Skynet network is less able to track him down should the time come. Though he and his mother, Sarah Connor, prevented Judgment Day from occurring on August 29th, 1997 when they prevented the creation of the network, he still lives in fear that the end of the world still may come. He fears are correct as the T-X is looking for him but a T-850, like the one sent to kill him before he was born, has been sent by the resistance movement to ensure his survival. The events that occurred in T2: Judgment Day didn't prevent Judgment Day, it just delayed it. Within three hours, nearly 3 billion human lives will be destroyed in an instant. Now John Connor must team up with the Terminator and his future wife to try and prevent Judgment Day once again. The story for T3 is not as fabulous as the one done for T2 but with James Cameron not directing this time around, did anybody really expect it to be? Having the opening of the film focus on the thoughts of John Connor and then flash forward to a battle between machines and man was a good way to start off the picture. There are a couple of holes in the plot of the film that could have explained why certain things happen within the film but they really aren't a huge matter for the film. The ending to the film was also well done but more could have been shown.<br/><br/>The only returning cast member from Terminator 2 is Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as the T-850 Terminator that he made famous nearly twenty years ago. Once again Arnold works extremely well with this role. Though more of the character was done using CGI then in the other previous films, Schwarzenegger still provides an emotional voice to the character in those types of situations. Edward Furlong, who played young John Connor in T2, was dropped from the project when the studio believed that his drug and alcohol problems would delay production, so Nick Stahl was brought in to replace him in the role. Stahl is the not the perfect replacement but still does a very good job with the character. Kristanna Loken is the new villain in the Terminator franchise playing the role of the T-X Terminator, Skynet's most sophisticated killing machine. She is very plain with her emotion which is good since she plays a machine. The only problem with her character is the questions left unanswered. Her character is made of liquid metal but at one point during the film a part of her is damaged prevent the use of a primary weapon but the film doesn't explain why this happens. But that really has more to do with the plot then with her. Claire Danes rounds out the rest of the main cast as the future wife of John Connor. There weren't that many scenes with in the course of the film that really focus on her, which is good since John is more of the focus, but most of the scenes that she was involved in were well done. The introduction of her character and the whole idea of destiny (her and John meeting and eventually getting married) was a good twist to the story.<br/><br/>Overall, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a good summer popcorn film. T3 doesn't even come close to the majesty of T2 and for several reasons. The dialogue is much less serious then T2 but this was to be expected with James Cameron not at the helm this time around. The plot holes presented in the film also hurt the overall effect. There is no clear explanation on what Skynet is exactly and how it is able to control the machines if there is no core. There are also unanswered questions involving how John Connor and the Terminator are able to enter a secret military area with no problems at all. This doesn't seem to really matter as all Hell breaks loose soon after. The film is also less dramatic then the first sequel and plays more for just action and laughs but that seems to work on its own level. There were many humorous moments in the film with some working like the statements made by the T-850 replying to situations that machines can't understand. But there were also moments that didn't work. For example, the T-X inflates her breasts to get the attention of a cop who pulls her over. This was unnecessary as the cop didn't even seem to notice. Besides some minor complaints, there are many things that work for the film. The fact that Jonathan Mostow makes this his own film instead of just trying to copy what James Cameron did in T2 is fabulous. The action sequences were well done and the special effects were just absolutely amazing especially at the very end of the film. Speaking of the ending, it was a little disappointing that the film makers ended the film the way they did but that allows them to follow up with a fourth Terminator film and not give away too much. T3 may not be the best film out there but it is still a great film to enjoy over the holiday weekend.<br/><br/>My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)"

","Ii have waited for this film for years, and let me tell you, it was worth the wait.<br/><br/> The first time i watched T3, i came out with mixed feelings because all the scenes that i really wanted to see in the film were missing. I was really looking forward to seeing the CRS build T-1s and T-600/800 endoskeletons. Most of all, i wanted to see Chief Master Sergeant William Candy. When i watched the movie, i saw that many scenes were cut out. So, when i watched T3 for the second time, I LOVED IT. Things just fit together perfectly. T3 is definitely my favorite of the trilogy. IMO, it told the coolest story out of the three.<br/><br/> We finally see Skynet's rise to power. Also, the story had heart and it had a soul. T3 was basically John Connor's story. At the beginning of the film, he is a slacker who wants no part of his destiny. At the end of the film, he finally accepts his fate as the leader of the human race. Nick Stahl gave a fantastic performance as John Connor, he made you care for the character and he actually made the character's inner emotional struggle throughout the film believable.<br/><br/> Claire Danes was excellent as Kate Brewster. Kate is very much like the Sarah Connor of the first film. She is an innocent woman who is suddenly taken away from her life and put into a world full of terror and death. Kate is very important to the plot of the film and to the terminator story as a whole.<br/><br/> Arnold is perfect as The Terminator, what else can i say? Kristanna Loken gave a great performance as the T-X. IMO, she was just as terrifying and menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well. The humor worked fine IMO, it was very similar to T2 in this aspect. The humor comes at the right time.<br/><br/> To all the naysayers, this IS NOT a remake or a rehash of T2. It is a worthy continuation of the terminator story full of new and fresh ideas. The ending of the film is just awesome. Its probably the best ending in years. Same goes for the action and special effects. Stan Winston and ILM did an excellent job. Kudos to Jonathan Mostow to staying true to T-1 and T2 and giving us a terrific third installment. Hopefully, he will return for T4, which will be the full future war film. 10/10"

","I went to Terminator 3 with skepticism, having enjoyed watching T2 over and over as a kid (I'm 22). The thing that really bugged me initially about Terminator 3 before I entered the theater, was that there was no Linda Hamilton and no Edward Furlong.<br/><br/>No James Cameron too direct!?<br/><br/>How good can it be??<br/><br/>Having just seen Terminator 3 a little over an hour ago, I can't remember the last time I was blown away by a movie. Arnold is still as cool as ever, reprising his breakthrough role with more stunts that you can expect a 54 year old body builder to take on. The Terminatrix is great and Kristanna Loken takes the role with artificial intelligence written all over her. Nick Stahl has the John Connor role down to a T. The Kate Brewster character had to sink in for a while, but the chemistry between her and Connor is comparable to that of Kyle and Sarah.<br/><br/>However, if you know and love the first two films like I do, you can only get so much out of the third act. It has all the action and explosions that you can expect from a summer action thriller. But there lacks the storytelling that James Cameron was known to carefully mesh into breathtaking action and effects. Without the powerful story telling of James Cameron, this movie is really just about getting away from the bad guy and stopping the inevitable nuclear war. I loved seeing prototypes of the Skynet computers come to life, reconizing them from the first two movies. I was even taken by Kate Brewster's connection to John Connor and events preceding Terminator 2 and the way they hate each other upon knowing they will one day be married. But despite the cleverness, familiarity and even the disturbing nuclear fear that John Mostow brings to the series I struggle to come to the conclusion that Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines is just a way to bring back a loved character. I wish it (the story telling NOT the action) had been better. ** out of 4."

","Before seeing this movie, there wasn't a lot of promoting going on and I'm disappointed with that matter. Everybody's upset because James Cameron didn't put his two cents into the movie. Well, WHO CARES!!! This is what I call a movie. It's been a long time since I've seen a good movie. Especially since this is an anticipated one. I've been longing to see Arnold back with a machine gun in his hand or whatever arsenal he can equip himself with as the lethal and clever terminator. I loved this movie. It beats all the other movies for the summer. Rated R action shows hardcore here. Forget what the critics say about this movie. Terminator 3 lived up to its name. If they didn't like this 3rd one then they can forget about liking the whole series all together.<br/><br/>Jonathan Mostow did a great job. He took on a big project that I think all other directors would have been scared to do. If I saw him in person I'd congratulate him on a job well done. I love the terminator series. I forgot he did U-571. In my opinion Cameron missed out. I don't care if he didn't direct. It's time for somebody to try something new.<br/><br/>Even though this movie costs 175 million to make, it doesn't matter. The action made up for it. The special effects was the best I've seen in a while. THANKS STAN WINSTON!!! I'm proud of that. I'm a martial arts movie maniac. There wasn't martial arts in it, and that just it, old fashioned beat 'em up style (thrown through walls, slammed, etc.) The humor was great too. Only thing that was off was the father of Claire Danes's character. He didn't seem to emotional when he thought she was killed. Oh well, still great movie. Can't wait for the dvd to come out. Last thing, Kristanna Loken did great as the villian and sexy too. GO SEE IT EVERYBODY!!!!"

","When compared to the first and second Terminator movies, T3 is probably average at best.<br/><br/>The special effects were top notch but the movie seemed forced. Whereas the first and second at times grew deep and philosophical (or as much as this storyline would allow), T3 had none of that. It was just action scenes mixed in with ho-hum dialogue to explain what was about to happen next.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 technically was a sequel, but it didn't *feel* like a sequel. T2 could have stood on its own.<br/><br/>Terminator 3, on the other hand, pretty much assumes that the viewer is familiar with the storyline. Old characters (just one really) are shamelessly plugged in for quick appearances that didn't further the storyline one bit. New characters have been added and their histories faked to appear as if they've always been a part of the Terminator world. The movie watched as if it was the last season of some long running television series overdue for retirement.<br/><br/>On the plus side, T3 has some strengths. As mentioned earlier, the special effects were excellent. Also, the writers gave the Terminator some hilarious moments.<br/><br/>This is a short movie and the action moves briskly. Watch it if you're a fan of the series or if you're into awesome action scenes, but don't expect it to be very deep. 6 out of 10."

","When I went to go see T3 today, I wasn't expecting much. This was for<br/><br/>three reasons:<br/><br/>1) Its a modern day sequel based on great classic movies, and most modern sequels suck. 2) It wasn't directed or written by James Cameron. 3) How the hell could the story fit?! IT ENDED IN T2!<br/><br/>So, I went in with not expecting much. God I was wrong. While it isn't as good as THE TERMINATOR or its sequel TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, I say it was very entertaining. The action sequences were good, and the story fit well into the existing time line. The acting was also very good. I was kind of disappointed that Edward Furlong didn't come back to play John Connor, and I was really hoping for a cameo of Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor and Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese (I know he is dead, but he did make a cameo in T2, just watch the deleted scenes on the T2 Extreme DVD), but we can't have everything now, can we? I was also pleased that there were some very funny inside jokes to us Terminator fans.<br/><br/>Also, the T-X was a pretty good ruthless villain, even though she will never compare to Robert Patrick's T-1000 or Arnold's original T-101. The movie also, of course, sets up for a sequel which will be very interesting (I'd tell you why, but then it would ruin the ending).<br/><br/>Overall, it was pretty entertaining and better than expected."

There were some excellent sequences that deserve the proper recognition.  The crane chase was creative and entertaining.  A few other ideas that I won't mention were good, along with the introduction to skynet, but these were not enough.  I didn't feel the same intensity that T2 brought me, or the sense of originality that T1 gave to me.<br/><br/>The movie runs short, less than two hours.  The dialogue seemed a little cheap.  But worst of all, the story was second rate.  For as much money as they spent, they could make sure everything is excellent, not just the special effects.

"felixnlu","Null","0","0","2 July 2003"," Dumb movie, great ending
","As a big fan of early Cameron (T1, Aliens, T2), I was as skeptical as everyone else about this movie. From the opening credits through the first hour, I really had to suppress the urge to walk. Everything looked cheap (where did that 150 mil go?), the ""humor"" was groan-inducing, and the direction was very pedestrian. Worst of all, there were plot holes galore. As I'm sure others have mentioned, why did TX need a gun when her arm was a veritable Swiss Army Knife of a killing device? Also, the time line was completely screwed up with the revelation that Sarah Connor died in 1997. And how did Arnie, John Connor and Kate Brewster just waltz into the military complex? And on, and on, and on...<br/><br/>Then came the ending. A real corker that I did not see coming (especially given how run-of-the-mill the movie had been to that point). I don't know which of the five credited writers we can thank for this, but the ending just does redeem the rest of the movie. It reminded me of an M. Night Shaymalan-type finish.<br/><br/>Arnie looked good, but was just a supporting player. As in T2 when a buffed out Linda Hamilton stole the show, the movie belongs to Nick Stahl and Claire Danes. They did a very believable job with a very weak script. Kudos to the producers for casting scrawny, atypically looking protagonists and NOT teen idol models.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe T3 is worth a look, just to experience the ending. I do find it amazing that the same makers of this film who appeared so lazy with the storytelling, direction, etc. could have come up with an ending as brave as this one."
"mandalore15","Null","0","0","2 July 2003"," The runt of the litter
","If you are planning on seeing T3, do yourself a favor and don't watch the two previous films before you go see it.  Last weekend I watched The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day in preparation for this film. When measured next to its predecessors, Part 3 is definitely the runt of the litter.<br/><br/>That's not to say the movie is bad.  It actually has much going for it. Arnold is back in form as the Terminator.  His ownership of the role is absolute.  The action sequences are nicely done and pack a brutal punch. The performances are good for the most part.  Nick Stahl did a decent job as a burnt-out John Connor, who is now in his 20's and apparently an alcoholic and pill-popper.  Claire Daines makes the biggest transition in the film, from wide-eyed innocent to a hardened woman destined to be one of the few survivors of Judgment Day.  Kristanna Loken is appropriately emotionless and menacing as the advanced TX, but she can't hold a candle to the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) of the second film.  Arnold's nude time-travel arrival is a classic, and probably stands as my favorite Terminator entrance yet.  A cameo by our old friend Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen) is one of the film's best moments (the character of Silberman is the only character besides the Terminator himself to appear in all three movies).  A chase sequence involving a crane truck and fire engine is very impressive, and a fight in a bathroom between Arnold and the TX will have you wincing with imagined pain.<br/><br/>
Still, there are many things which keep this movie from greatness, not the least of which is the total absence of James Cameron and writer Bill Wisher, the architects of the Terminator universe.  Imagine George Lucas being completely uninvolved in a Star Wars film (which some would say would be a blessing, but that's for another argument).  That is the equivalent of Cameron being absent from a Terminator project.  My biggest complaint of the movie is the re-writing of the Terminator mythology to fit the plot needs of this film.  New characters are introduced who now are more important than John Connor to the survival of the human race.  Where did these people come from?  Why have we never heard of them before?  Another plot detail linking Claire Daine's character to the events of the second film feels contrived and silly.  The whole idea of ""no fate but what we make for ourselves"", which was a central ideal of the first two films, is basically thrown out the window here.  ""Fate cannot be changed"" is the theme of this movie. Also, I think this movie is, at times, just too cute for its own good. There are many groan-inducing one-liners and ""winks"" at the camera.  The Terminator is a legendary character in cinema, but this is the first film to really acknowledge that with these contrivances.<br/><br/>Most importantly, this film really feels unnecessary.  Cameron has said himself ""I've told my story"" and that really sums it up.  But since Cameron has no ownership of the franchise, those in charge have decided to push ahead without him, using director Jonathon Mostow instead to craft this very well-done action film.  But the Terminator films have always been more than action, and Mostow never really demonstrates the a grasp of that intangible ""bigness"" that Cameron has...but on two occasions I felt the epic scope of Cameron's films:  the first scene and the last.  Both images were excellent and haunting, making me wonder just what Cameron would've done with T3. Not this T3, but something from his own mind.  But that's not to be, and what we are left with is an entertaining but mediocre Terminator movie.  And with the pedigree established by previous two films, mediocre just doesn't cut it.<br/><br/>My Grade: C+"
"icewars2001","10","0","0","2 July 2003"," Cameron has the action, but Mostow packs the laughs
","I had always worried about someone else taking over the Terminator saga from James Cameron...something on the line of an Indiana Jones movie without Spielberg.  But I needn't have worried.  Jonathan Mostow has done a killer job with the continuation of the series (yes, I did say series and not trilogy)  Similar to the funny parts of Red Dragon, we find ourselves laughing uncontrollably at the exploits of the new T-101.  If anything is missing from the flick, it's the loss of a Brad Fiedel score...the one chase scene is virtually void of music in comparison to T2's canal chase. Would have liked to see how the movie would have been with Edward Furlong back as John Connor, but Nick Stahl does a respectable job---the local reviewer said he seemed like he'd get beat up quickly, but that's the WHOLE POINT...this is the story of how John learns to take responsibility for his inevitable destiny.  Go see this movie...twice."
"level5nerd","8","0","0","2 July 2003"," Good enough (Heavy spoilers)
","Again, there are some very strong spoilers.  I liked this movie a lot -- it was almost as good as the first, possibly slightly better.  The ending, and I won't say exactly what happens, sent some very strong chills down my spine.  The original had an almost perfect screenplay (aside from the fact that Kyle's flashbacks always end in certain death with no explanation of his escape), but there were some problems with acting and SFX.  The second one had no substance whatsoever.  In fact, one of my biggest complaints was that it reworked the handling of the time travel paradox -- in the first movie, the future created itself, while in the second, it prevented itself. They can't have it both ways.  If they had had this as the sequel (with a few changes), it would have been an improvement over the original, maybe even a perfect 10.  Sadly, the second movie dragged down the franchise. 7/10."
"ixzer","8","0","0","2 July 2003"," A Worthy Addition to the Terminator series
","Warning: Spoilers Ahead<br/><br/>After 12 years since the classic T-2, Rise of the Machines has finally been unleashed into the marketplace. However much is missing from this film and that essential element is JAMES CAMERON himself. For the previous Terminator films, Cameron has provided his name to the credits of writer, producer and director. With his complete absence from the third installment, hardcore fans will definitely notice the change in style for T-3. This comes as both a positive and a negative. T-3 does not come close to being as good as T-2, however it is still a solid movie on its own. Its action is exciting and well executed, and it's visual and sound effects are far above average. However the presence of Cameron's humour and action is sorely missed. Perhaps this is because we were so used to him being attached to the first two films that with the addition of Jonathan Mostow instead as director, things just feel a little too different. I suppose one could compare this to Steven Spielberg's departure from Jurassic Park 3 (Lost World sucked, so maybe he was just being smart, but Jurassic Park 3 was the better movie overall). Jurassic Park 3 was handled by Joe Johnston instead and with its brisk running time, the action and humour was quick and fun. T-3 has the same feel to it. Its story is not as gripping and the human emotion is not as strong as T-1 or T-2. But credit must be given to the writers and director for their attempts at matching Cameron's previous works. This film serves as an addition to Sequel Summer 2003, but it's a better than average sequel for the most part.<br/><br/>The acting is decent for a Sci-Fi action film and as stated before, the action and visual/sound effects will keep you entertained. The humour from the three main central cast members of Arnold, Nick Stahl, and Claire Danes is just right (Arnold's one linear are for the most part fun, but maybe a little too used towards the end of the film.). The film is also not overly long, perhaps clocking in at exactly 120 minutes.<br/><br/>My only major problem with the film was its musical score by Marco Beltrami. I don't understand at all why Brad Fiedel was not used again to compose and conduct the musical score. His transition from T-1 to T-2 was amazing. The new score is not horrible; it's just not memorable at all. I left the theater missing the Terminator overture (however it is played during the end credits with less effect than the touching finale in T-2.)<br/><br/>Another oddity was ""Where exactly did Arnie get the shotgun from?"" We see him get his clothes, but when he first arrives to save Katherine Brewster, he is suddenly blasting away at the T-X. An easy mistake like this would have been avoided by Cameron. This is not a big deal, but before watching T-3, I viewed T-1 and T-2 again, and Cameron was quite careful with subtle details. Perhaps a deleted scene with commentary will clear this up, but this sort of problem gives way to the notion ""This movie is pretty clean cut in terms of technicalities, but because of that one noticeable error, it annoys me.""<br/><br/>As for the T-X, I thought she was a sexy robot assassin; however I could not help but feel her improvements as a Terminator were just modified for coolness and not for killing efficiency. T-X does not hold a candle to the T-1000 in terms of presence. For the most part, Kristanna Loken's attempt as a Terminator was well attempted, but falls flat. I never felt intimidated by her and she didn't have that poker face look that Robert Patrick had when asking ""Are you the legal guardians of John Connor?'<br/><br/>I kept myself in the dark for T-3. I didn't want to ruin it for myself. I didn't follow any news from its official website or read magazine articles. I even felt that the trailers and TV spots were poor. But upon watching the film in theaters on opening day, I was satisfied with the end product. It was just a fun film to watch. I wish the film luck in breaking even with its $170 million U.S. budget.<br/><br/>8/10"

"ShewBacka","10","0","0","2 July 2003"," Typical 3rd Entry
","T3 is like most other third entries into trilogies: it has run out of steam. The idea of a futuristic, omnipotent robot being sent back into time to eradicate the head of a stubborn resistance to a future apocalypse was novel in 1984 and was mastered in 1991.  But now it is getting old, just like Arnie.<br/><br/>The following is a step by step analysis of why T2 just didn't work.<br/><br/>SPECIAL EFFECTS:  The notion that after a 12 year impeovement in technology and 70 million dollar increase in budget will ensure superior special effects is a given.  T3 has better special effects than T2.  But that is the only significant category that it scores a win.<br/><br/>VILLAIN:  This was the biggest mistake made by the developers of this film. The TX was not nearly as imposing or fearsome as either of her predecessors. I just don't have the same fear of a woman that I would a man.  Secondly, why would Skynet go back to an exoskeleton robot?!  Robert Patrick's liquid metal was an idea that should have been expanded in this movie, not scrapped.  They should have gone with Vin Diesal, a man who can hold his own with Arnie.<br/><br/>JOHN CONNOR:  Although Stahl was adequate as Furlong's replacement, he didn't have the same edge.<br/><br/>PLOT:  There were way too many holes in this plot.  So many things were left either unexplained or were not elaborated on.  For example, how could Skynet have been created after they destroyed its roots in T2?  Granted, the end twist was clever, and the last 30 minutes were definetely a return to T2 form, but it just didn't feel like a Terminator movie, and too many questions were left unanswered.  Interestingly, hints were given for a T4, and the ending left that door wide open and swinging.<br/><br/>MUSIC:  Music plays a vital role in the suspense of a movie.  So many times in T3, I was wishing for the T2 theme to start playing.  It really would have added to the adrenaline rush that I felt so many times in T2.<br/><br/>In conclusion, T3 seemed like a hastily prepared entry into such an intricately developed franchise.  While T2 is the greatest action movie of alltime, T3 is an adequate sequel, highly entertaining (in part because of the humorous side to it), but nothing more.  It sits nicely alongside the first two, and is by no means a Jaws 3, but doesn't have the chemistry that either of the first two had.  Mostow is not Cameron, Loken is not Patrick, Stahl is not Furlong, and even though Arnie was still Arnie, T3 is not T2."

","I just saw this movie today and man was I blown away. T3 has everything a guy could ask for, hense the title. But where to start, hmmmm...<br/><br/>Let's start with Arnold. The original Terminator really puts life into a movie franchise that has been missing for almost 12 years. He really blew the movie away with his incredible acting and even better fighting scenes. The new John Conner, Nick Stahl, may seem like an odd and unknown choice at first, but he is really worthy of the role of Earth's future leader. He really breathed life into the role, plus he didn't sound like a girl when he screamed. Together, Arnold and Nick really make a great onscreen team.<br/><br/>But moving on to the main reason the movie was so great, the girls, Claire Daines and , especially, Kristanna Loken, were down right hot. Claire Daines replaces the empty role of the fighting machine that Linda Hamilton was in the first two movies. But even her good looks couldn't compete with Kristanna Loken's sexy killing machine that is the TX. Armed with a multi weapon arm, a shape-shifting body, an inflatable chest, etc. Kristanna really proved that the new female Terminator is nothing to be triffled with.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie rocked and is definantly a movie that needs to be seen by any sci-fi or Terminator fan.

","Being a huge fan of the Terminator series I was skeptical about T3.  At first I thought there was no way it could be as amazing as T2, especially since it was being done by a different director.  When I saw the trailer to the movie, my mind changed instantly.  I couldn't wait to see it.  In the end however, the trailer was better than the movie.  Sad... It happened in Star Wars Episode 2, and it happened in this.  The problem was the story. Very weak, not enough of it, and too many parts left unexplained.  This probably is the greatest ""B"" movie of all time, but it could never stand up to T2 or even T1 for that matter.  Why?  No Cameron.  It's just that simple. He created the idea, he knows it best.  Mostow did good with the action, but the story just wasn't up to expectations.  The TX had the potential to be an awesome villain but in the end I think Dr. Silverman could have kicked her ass.  Good action, weak story.  This movie was rushed.  I give it a 5 out of 10."

","The first TERMINATOR remains my favorite film ever. The second is right up there. So as far as film going goes these films mean a lot to me. Is it just me or are big films getting worse by the month. Even with hints of decent stories pictures are so rushed now. Special effects, BOOM, special effects, JUMP CUT, F/X GALLORE, BOOM...THE END.<br/><br/>I miss the days of the eighties action flicks. Even the early nineties hung in there a bit with TOTAL RECALL, TERMINATOR 2 (despite its morality) and NATURAL BORN KILLERS. My point is these films the good ones, the intense action ones...the fun ones all stuck with violence. Shying away from violence teaches us guns and explosions lack consequence. Not to mention it's all fantasy. We're being taught not to have imagination.<br/><br/>The evolution of film ceases to exist. Technology needs to complement not substitute a story (a la MATRIX RE-LOADED and Terminator 3). Hopefully M. Night or Peter Jackson, or some kid at home writing a great story will inspire us."

","To say that the chase sequence, one of the few in Terminator 3, is as good as the highway chase in The Matrix Reloaded is stretching it a bit. I should say this though: The action in T3 is better than the action in any of the previous installments. They do a good job of tying in the previous two movies with references to Sarah Connor, as well as John Connor's lines to T-101: ""Don't you remember me? Hasta la vista? Any of that ring a bell?"" As well as a cameo by one of the supporting cast members of T2.<br/><br/>
I'd say one of my few disappointments with this film would be the opening credits. I was expecting something along the lines of T2, but they went a different route this time, and the catchy Terminator music doesn't come into play until the final credits, but oh well, just one small gripe.<br/><br/>
This movie is definitely worth seeing, and this is coming from someone who goes into movies like this thinking, ""Great, another sequel. It's going to suck."" But I enjoyed myself. They obviously didn't make this movie to get any Oscar bids, but they did cater to the audience, and made sure those who paid to see it had a good time...afterall, isn't that what it's all about?"

"AutoPilot","4","0","0","2 July 2003"," James Cameron: where art thou? The spirit you gave T1 & 2 has been Terminated!
","Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot.<br/><br/> T-3 doesn't have the feeling, spirit or intensity of T-1 or T-2. I say this with a heavy heart.<br/><br/> T-1 & 2 are among my favorite movies of all time. Arnie is the perfect Terminator, and I love many of his movies. This is the first time I've seen Nick Stahl, Kristanna Loken, or Claire Danes, and they all did a great job.<br/><br/> But the magic of the previous films was not there. The movie seemed like it was made by following the script and storyboards like a studio musician playing the notes from his sheet. Done correctly, but certainly not a Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison... and others like them who gave performances that explode with intense passion.<br/><br/> John Conner (Nick Stahl) He's burned out, on the run, doesn't have a plan or any direction, and a total wimp. Not even his Terminator obeys him.<br/><br/> T-X (Kristanna Loken) She's the new Terminator, and like her predecessor, the T-1000 played by Robert Patrick in T-2, she can change her appearance (but confusingly has the hard steel skeleton of the earlier model T-800, that Arnold plays) So sometimes she's liquid steel, and sometimes not, since she can change from female to male. Her face is beautiful and exotic, and she can look very cold, confident, and robotic; but not wicked evil and totally dedicated like Patrick's Terminator of T-2.<br/><br/> Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) Nice close-ups, a beautiful face and good acting, she played her part well. Still, there was simply not the intensity of purpose that Linda Hamilton brought to the previous films.<br/><br/> T-800 (Arnold) Erroneously calling himself a T-101, Arnie, is back! Arnie, of course is `The Terminator,' so it's hard to screw-up that role. But he can only do what the script allows. He plays his part, delivers his one-liners, but is a different Terminator than he played earlier. Same model, but as we all know, the second Terminator played by Arnold, was terminated. So there is no `feeling' between him and John Conner, or Kate Brewester like there was in the earlier films between John and his mother Sara Conner. In fact it seems Arnold doesn't care about them at all.<br/><br/> Music Score: What score? Although Terminator has one of the finest theme and soundtrack music in the history of modern movies, they simply didn't use it. It's like a Star Wars movie without the classic theme song. A major mistake.<br/><br/>Tension, mood, drama, feeling, intensity, story, plot. ooops, completely forgot about all of that. Just cram in as much action and destruction as a movie can hold within one hour and 45 minutes.<br/><br/> Special Effects: At least most of them were real (I hope) as opposed to computer generated. I'm talking about the `Vehicle' chase scenes. In this episode, female Terminator TX remotely controls un-manned police and fire engines, while simultaneously and physically driving a large crane on wheels, laying massive destruction in her path. Many cars and telephone poles lost their lives in this chase scene. While very destructive, it just didn't compare to previous Terminator chase scenes, especially the one in the concrete storm ditch of T-2. Surprisingly, special effects were minimal and not very impressive. The steel Terminator endoskeleton was the same as the original, so nothing new there and personally, I thought the flying robots looked very amateur and out-dated.<br/><br/> The screening I attended was the first public showing in one of Los Angeles', newest and largest theatres. It was of course filled, but the audience reaction was very subdued. A few chuckled at some of the one-liners and one couldn't help but laugh at Arnie's first pair of sunglasses. Another laugh came when the Female Terminator TX saw a billboard with a Buxom model with the words: What is Sexy?' and decided to redirect some of her liquid steel to her chest area and - Viola! Instant breast enlargement! The interesting thing is the very favorable and quite audible reaction was by the females in the audience as they squealed with joy and envy at such power.<br/><br/> In conclusion, I think the movie suffered without the direction of James Cameron. The plot was filled with holes the size of large nuclear craters. The movie was dependant on fast action to carry it, but other than the chase scene near the beginning, it just didn't. The ending was very weak, but its intent was quite obvious - it was a lead-in to Terminator 4. As Arnold likes to say: ""I'll be back!""<br/><br/> The Bottom Line:   Disappointment. Even still, I recommend seeing it because the series, like Star Wars, is a legend. It would leave a void otherwise, and it's necessary to understand future Terminator movies."

Though many critics may claim that the absence of director James Cameron may have influenced the style and feel of the movie, I beg to differ, and must add that Jonathon Mostow has done a great job at elevating the depth of the Terminator series fanthom more. Of all the features that this movie displays, its main appeal comes from its level of realism, which adds to its worth in our everyday lives and its influence on various choices and applications that mankind drives to make.<br/><br/> The cast is mint, fresh off the shelf (with the exception of Arnold, and on a lighter note, a comic relief Earl Boen, aka. Dr. I'm not Crazy but I am going Crazy). Nick Stahl does an excellent job at fitting the role of John Connor, as he is an highly undescisive character that is not obviously determined to save the world, nor denies his existence, but rather, lives to see himself evolve into the leader of the resistence. Clares Daine does a pretty good job at playing newly introduced and old time childhood friend Brewster, but nothing worth noting.  Arnold? Heck, this guy is unstoppable, since he is essentially, body, mind and soul, the living version of Terminator itself. Unfortunately, Loken, falls a bit short in giving the audience that thriller look. Certainly, she is sexy, sleek and even a bit quirky, but I don't think it was really her fault for her lack of thrillism (invented word), but the castings' fault. All in all, she does give it her best.<br/><br/> The first half hour of T3 is sort of an introduction of what John Connor has become since the last installment. John Connor, trying to protect mankind, hides himself from society and becomes a ghost to the world. Not quite, as KAZAAM, TX appears in her little magic ball, etc. etc.. etc... From here on, there is nothing but pure heart-pounding action, and perhaps the greatest scene was the massive 6 car/truck chase b/w TX, T Model 101, Connor and Brewster. The effects in this movie puts Matrix and its successors to shame. It just goes to show that to make something look real, it ought to be real. Anyhow, that's my 2 cents. I give this installment 4/5 stars (relative to 4/5 stars for T2 and 4.5/5 stars for T1)."

","I, like many other people, went into see terminator 3 with a grim face. After all, how could any movie top terminator 2?  Especially with everything that was going against this movie being good.  After watching it though, I am a convert.  Terminator 3 is both an excellent movie experience and a thrilling follow-up to T2.  The only thing that dampened the movie for me were the sheer number of people who sat their hating on the movie. Going to see T3 with loads of amateur ""movie critics"" is a bad idea.  As is going to see T3 with the impression that its going to be anything more than a thrilling action romp through the present day.  In my book T3 succeeds to do everything it set out to and then some.  I definitely rank it a 10/10"
"Skullbussa","Null","0","0","4 July 2003"," Much better than it should be
","Mostow's a hack, Arnold has lost his machismo over the years, and the story of T3 is nearly the same thing we saw 10 years ago in Cameron's T2.<br/><br/>So why is this movie *the* summer action movie of 2003?<br/><br/>Because it avoids using tacky, modern, computer special effects (*cough*...Matrix Reloaded) and instead uses classic Hollywood stunt work and REAL cars smashing into each other.  Because it has a tight narrative that doesn't indulge itself while keeping the audience hostage until the climax we all paid $8 for.<br/><br/>The (surprisingly thin) audience for this flick on July 3rd was only happy to oblige the film with applause and laughs. This movie is great fun, much more fun than Hulk or Matrix 2.  There is something charming about an action movie where the hero actually looks like a hero rather than some pallid dork in a black trenchcoat who is more interested in looking good than pounding their enemy into a pulp.<br/><br/>The best action sequences of the summer of 2003 are in Terminator 3, no question about it. The movie cost $170 million and you see every cent on screen.  Arnold's T-101 takes more and more damage as the film progresses. You first see blood, then scaring with metal underneath, then complex CGI/makeup/prosthesis where you can actually see THROUGH Arnold's jaw structure.  This is Stan Winston's best work in years and proves he is still at the top of his game.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor was always an annoying character and it's good to see her out of the series to focus more attention on John Connor.  Sarah always came across as an anti-social, bitter hippy rather than somebody who has the burden of man's ultimate survival on her shoulders.<br/><br/>
The script is nothing amazing, although it has an excellent ending that gives the film some real gravity.  The film is full of humor and resembles the original Terminator film more closely than T2 in this regard. <br/><br/>
If you want to know what T3 is like think of it this way:<br/><br/>Take T2, strip out Sarah Connor, take out about 30 minutes of worthless boy/robot bonding and ridiculous man/machine sentiment (remember that horrible weepy ending to T2? LOL!), add an Arnold who is less apt to mock himself and a very serious, somber ending and you have T3.<br/><br/>Really the only thing lacking is T1000 from T2. Robert Patrick did a great job, and don't get me wrong...the chick who plays the T-X does a great job as well, but for some reason she just isn't as menacing. She seems to not be able to handle good old T-101 as well as the T1000 could.  I would also really like to see her in a bathing suit."
"allar100","5","0","0","4 July 2003"," inferior
","This was a sad sad attempt to make a another installment to some pretty great films.  First off, they try to add too much comedy to the movie making it a times just plain stupid.  The T-X is great to look at, but other than that, she is cheap attempt to recapture the magic of T-1000.  The sound is off and cartoonish at times, just to name a few flaws.  In my opinion, the only redeemining thing form this film is the ending which I thought was kind of cool.  See it if you must, but it really is a let down."

","Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines is a good movie for kids 14 and up.  I don't really understand why it is rated R except for the strong violence. Arnold does a awesome job at being a bad ass and kicking some machine butt. In the beginning they try to set up the viewers with a little information about what Judgement day is and who John Conner is.  I would however recommend seeing one of the previous Terminators before seeing this film. It is action packed and very funny (in a good way).  Arnold has developed a witty sense of humor in this film and it lets the audience take a deep breath and relax from all the action.  A good movie for guys, girls-only go as a favor to your man, otherwise you'll be bored stiff.  Good film, check it out for yourself... It IS the summer of sequels after all."

In this movie Arnie seemed alot less friendly and I didn't really like that. But hey, everybody wants to have their cake and eat it :D so in my opinion it's a movie worth seeing even for die hard Terminator fans who might not get everything they wanted in it. I give it 8 of out 10 stars.<br/><br/>Good job on bringing the Terminator back to life."

","Given the advance word was so awful, I was relieved to find this to be an entertaining, almost jocular movie at times.  Mostow made a good choice in making this a self-referential flick that borders on near-parody at times, only to lose the levity when the drama required it.  I won't spoil the ending, but this movie has stones, that's for sure.  High art it ain't, but high entertainment it is.  Sure, it's got plot holes you could drive a giant crane chasing a giant fire truck through, but honestly, it's T3, what do you expect?  Sit back, check that film school attitude at the door, and let Governor Arnie remind you why he is who he is.<br/><br/>And damn, Schwarzenegger looks as sculpted here as he did 20 years ago. It's a sight to behold.  I wonder if there's a bit of Bond-O holding things together, but it's impressive nonetheless."

","Of course this is not better than T2, which is the best in the franchise so far. T1 is slightly better than T3 though. The movie just felt too short.

Nick Stahl & Claire Danes did real good jobs too. <br/><br/>The T-X chick did good, though Robert Patrick is still the best villian in the franchise.<br/><br/>The CGI was actually decent when used, & didnt really ruin the movie (i.e. HULK, CHARLIES ANGELS 2).<br/><br/>This is 1 of the better movies to come out this year, so go see it.

","I saw T3 on July 3, 2003 and it was great! The effects were great and the characters! But there was one problem, EVERYTHING WAS TOO EXTREME! Almost everything seemed impossible! Something like the T-X can never exist! I mean a combination of liquid metal and a robot! It's impossible to create such a thing. Even for 2029, it's still extreme. Arnold was the best character and stole the show. The sexy T-X made a great appearance and I give this film a 7. Where's Cameron when you need him? The problem with the second milleniumm, is some of the movies. Matrix Reloaded was horrible! I hated it! X-Men and X2 were fantastic! Spider-Man was awesome! Hulk was extreme!

","Being that 1. James Cameron had nothing to do with this picture and 2. I knew this movie was bound to turn the Terminator series into one big continuity error (which in many ways it already was), I went into the theater today expecting a disaster. Surprisingly though, the end result is pretty good.<br/><br/>My misgivings about a third Terminator film were, ""Didn't James Cameron and William Wisher make it abundantly clear that they resolved it by the end of the last one?"" But the new Arnold model explains that the actions at the end of the movie, ""Only postponed Judgement Day. It is inevitable."" Which explains it. The writing and directing on this film is not as solid as both of its' predecessors were, but they're not bad either. Only problem with Jonathan Mostow as a director was, if Ang Lee had taken this instead of The Hulk, he could have given it the darker Cameron-esque feel to it that it lacks with Mostow. But it is well-done with him.<br/><br/>People don't generally watch movies like the Terminator series for its' Oscar winning acting (and if they do, it's time to get off the reefer), but most of it is pretty good. The T-X is the most interesting Terminator villain, primarily because she is played by Kristanna Loken, whom I'm going to keep an eye on from now one because she's one of the most beautiful girls I've ever seen. Nick Stahl, as John Connor, is a little less successful than Edward Furlong, but he's not bad. Only real disappointment was Claire Danes, because I just don't see her as John Connor's girlfriend.<br/><br/>I'm not going to point out the continuity errors on this, no spoilers, just errors pointed out:<br/><br/>1. When the Terminator, John and Kate come across Sarah Connor's ""grave"" it is marked: 1959-1997. In the Terminator, which is clearly and distinctly set in 1984, Sarah is nineteen. So she would have been born in 1955, not 1959. 2. This movie is set in 2003, but John Connor is said to be twenty-two. In T2, which was set in 1994, he was supposed to be ten, not thirteen, as said in this movie. Although to be fair, the actor playing young John was 13 at the time.<br/><br/>A few nitpicks, but nothing major. Good day."
"medrjel","6","0","0","3 July 2003"," HUGE LETDOWN
","I need to be very careful not to give away anything, but I will state what I feel the major failings are:<br/><br/>1) From Edge of Realism to Comic Book. The thing I loved about the first 2 movies was even though much of it was unbelievable, there was quite a bit of tension and realism to the characters and chases. The problem was that T2 pushed the limits. They decided to go farther, and it just became rediculous. Most of the chases I found myself laughable they were so silly.<br/><br/>2) Too Many rules changed. If you watch T1 and T2 before T3, you will see exactly what I mean by the way the T-101 acted, especially, since it's not supposed to be the same as from the prior movie(s).<br/><br/>3) The theme changed. I feel like the story was going one way in the first 2 movies, and they completely changed their minds as to what to do.<br/><br/>Now, I don't want to say the story was without merit and the ending wasn't good, but it was executed and designed POORLY. It feels more like ""let's revive the Terminator movie just to make it"" rather than ""now, how do we pull it all together?"".<br/><br/>I think perhaps another 6 months to 1 year to work on the storyboarding and scripting was needed to make this a really good movie, because if this was the first movie, there would NEVER EVER EVER been even a snowflake's chance in hell on the hottest day of the year while sitting in an over set to 5,000,000 F all day for a sequel, let alone anyone caring about it.<br/><br/>James Cameron, WHY DID YOU LET THEM DO THIS TO YOUR MOVIE???!!!!! I DON'T CARE IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT, YOU SHOULD OF DONE SOMETHING TO HAVE SAVED THIS MOVIE FROM WHAT HAPPENED!"

","As a movie seen only for Action:  finely entertaining. As a film based on some kind of story:  hardly entertaining.<br/><br/>It's always good when a sequel can stand alone as a story, but T3 would fail (miserably) to do so.  T3 is more of an extended ending to T2, as no effort is made to really set the scene in this movie.  Instead, T3 relies on its previous incarnations for any understanding of what is happening or why.  <br/><br/>As almost everything is recycled, and the only surprise is<br/><br/>the not exceptionally optimistic end, the Who Cares factor<br/><br/>kills the terminators deader than they already are.<br/><br/>So hey, the cars go boom boom nicely.

"art_inme82","7","0","0","2 July 2003"," A good, solid, film; however, the lack of Cameron diminishes it's overall effect.
","The original ""Terminator"" was an amazing film for 1984, the action was unprecedented, the visuals phenomenal, and the human drama a welcome surprise. In 1991 James Cameron shocked audiences by making T2 better than the original in almost every area; creating one of the greatest films of all time. T3: Rise Of The Machines is a really good film; however, the lack of Cameron's directing is felt throughout the entire film, greatly diminishing its overall effect. For instance, the acting sequences in this one are more confusing than the one's in T2; gone are the days of the T-1000(in a Semi) chasing the young John Conner(on a dirt-bike) while Arnold(on a Harley) pursues both of them. Cameron has a way of making audiences completely understand an action sequence, Jonathan Mostow still has a lot to learn.<br/><br/>As T3 begins we don't get any of the classic Terminator music that was present in the last 2 films, instead we get eary music which is very quickly followed by the film's title, ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines;"" which of course is then followed by Arnold's full name, reminding all of us that while James Cameron and Linda Hamilton may be missing, we all came to see Arnold kick some ass. The film has a hard time, at first, making us feel pity or any other form of compassion for, the older and more mature, John Conner. Thankfully by the time John explains to us how his mother, Sarah Conner, died of cancer we've actually grown to like John. Soon after the introduction of John, we meet the new terminator: a Terminatrix, played farely well by newcomer Kristinna Lokken. The TX is an improvement over the T-1000, she can form weapons with her liqued metal skin and she can also infiltrate and control other machines; however, despite all of her advancements she doesn't quite make us shuddder in fear like the original T-101 or T-1000. After all of the new characters have been introduced the movie descends into one action scene after another, while all are good, we still feel like we're covering old ground. Thankfully, just when you think the new Terminator is a little soft, she graphically impales a detective with her arm and then procedes to drive the car from the back seat: With Her ""ARM"" still sticking through his chest! Yes, it was a very disturbing scene. Despite all of the new action sequences, I really enjoyed listening the John Conner's little lectures about the future, fate, machines and his own destiny. They didn't feel ""canned"" in the least, I was very impressed.<br/><br/>By the end of T3, I realised two very important things: (1) I actually care about what happens to John Conner and (2) The storyline of T2 has become ""almost"" completely obsolete; I may be the only one who feels this way, but the 3rd film in a trilogy is supposed to build upon the plot in the ""middle"" movie, not refute it. So there you have it, T3 is a new kind of Terminator movie; it doesn't improve upon the second film, but it presents a new face that's different enough to make the film very entertaining."

","Even if T3 seems to be just a modified remake of T2, that alone should make it worth watching. As a sequel, T3 will undoubtedly be attacked as not breaking any new ground like T1 (in a thematic way) or T2 (pioneering computer imaging), and for dragging out a franchise and career of an actor that some say should have long been put to rest. As a great fan of the other two Terminator movies, however, I have no problem with a 3rd installment that hasn't changed much. It still has thrilling action that even blows away summer block-buster rivals Hulk and Matrix Reloaded, and sustains the excitement through its open-ended conclusion. The dialogue, chock full of one-liners resembling classic Ah-nold flicks like Commando and Total Recall, is a bit corny in spots, but is generally enjoyable. Interestingly, this sequel returns to the gloom and doom theme choice of T1, and not the playful ""boy and his robot"" type of lightness of T2. All in all, this has been the best action movie and best sequel I have seen in a long, long time."

","I went into T3 not knowing what to expect.  I came away not knowing what to think.  <br/><br/>The movie is entertaining, let that be said.  The action never lets up except maybe at the end, where it could have used more punch.  In contrast to some reviews I actually liked the storyline, it just felt like it could have gone on a little longer.<br/><br/>Arnold is as charismatic as ever, even with the low amount of dialogue.  I was a bit disappointed the lengths the filmmakers went to poke fun at T-800. I wished he could have been a bit closer to the meaner Terminator from the first movie in contrast to the ""softer"" one from T2.  There are many laughs in the film and this is welcome.  The first movie was more of a B horror flick and T2 more sci-fi.  T3 falls somewhere in between the previous two in nearly all areas.<br/><br/>The special effects were very good.  The final iteration Arnold goes through in the end is magnificent.  I wished it could have lasted longer. <br/><br/>
With the Matrix Reloaded we had a film that was simply too much.  It also had a story that was so convoluted I really gave up on caring what happens to the characters.  T3 is the opposite in nearly all areas.  It needed more of everything except a few less corny lines.<br/><br/>In the end I am now wishing for T4 and an all out battle.  I hope it comes because like the previous two movies, T3 leaves the audience hanging wondering what is going to happen."

","Arnold is finally back, looks just as great as he did the day he did T2. I was expecting the movie to be great and it was great, however as expected it would not surpass T2. Mr. Cameron can rest easy on that one, cause deep down we all know that nothing can beat T2, unless he decides to do a T4 which would be fantastic.<br/><br/>I loved the action, could be even better than T2's action, but that still remains to be seen. Both Arnold and Kristanna carry the movie very well together, and they definitely have updated their ideas as far as technology goes. Nick Stahl who plays today's John Connor was alright but not great, the thing I am beginning to discover behind his character is he doesn't have much of one to begin with, even when you look at T2 with John you can sort of see the same thing. Claire Danes was pretty good as playing Kate Brewster and had some great emotion in her character.<br/><br/>The only things I didn't like about it was it was missing the feel of soul, of humanity, the fact that machines were going to take over didn't really scare me that much in this one, I guess only cause in T1 and T2 we are told the stories of what happens and we can only imagine it which can be the true horror, but it would have been preferable if James Cameron were to illustrate that actual illusion because I know he can. The movie was too quick, as great as it was, we waited 12 long years for this and I think over 2 hours isn't too much to ask for.<br/><br/>But all that aside, I loved the ending, definately leaves the door wide open for one more, but I don't want to wait another 12 years for it, maybe 5 years at most would be good, but we will for sure be back!"

I don't know if the people in charge just ran out of ideas or the fact that James Cameron wasn't really involved had that much of an impact on the final product.  Regardless, here are my pros and cons of T3: Rise of the machines.<br/><br/>Pros (the smallest list):  Great action sequence and great acting all around from the cast.  Though I wasn't particularly happy with the casting choices in the matter of looks/public appeal/ect...all the actors did a fine job. Especially the in the role of the Terminatrix.  She nailed the cold and dispassionate look down pat.  Too bad they gave her lines like: a seductive ""I like your gun"" and inflatable breasts.  The chase/fight scenes were great.  One scene in particular (crane scnene) was dragged out too long, but overall it was great fun to watch.  Special effects were awesome.<br/><br/>Cons (oh where do I start?):  Arnold, though I adore him, definitely showed his age.  Also, his role had too many speaking parts.  Speaking parts are usually good, but for this character and his monotone voice, less is more. Also, they gave him way too many human characteristics than needed.  The opening scene was real cheesy too.  A badly cosmetically aged Stahl standing on a heap of rubble and pumping his arm like some kind of post-war cheerleader.  Gag!  They also tried to recapture the whole romance/fate thing like in the first but it was too obvious and there was no chemistry between the two.  Add in a few subplots which were never resolved or expanded upon and the story pretty much limped along at a choppy pace. <br/><br/>
One thing I loved about T1 and T2 was that the story itself was told fluidly and at a breakneck pace.  The action was consistent.  T3, on the otherhand, was filled with those tired old dramatic pauses which has the audience either shaking his head or yelling at the screen.  John Connor wasting precious moments staring at liquid metal like he'd never seen it before. Talking scenes and poignant looks that have the characters actually STOPPING in the middle of a chase sequence.  In ""real life"" they would have been wasted!  Overall, it was just waaay too typical of every other bubble-gum scifi/horror flick in the past."

","Okay, this wasn't as memorable as T1 or T2 but for some reason it didn't matter that much to me. I guess I really wasn't expecting much and ended up getting more. I have to say that without Linda Hamilton the film was missing something. She gave soul to the first 2 and her absence is felt. Would have been nice to see Edward Furlong back also but apparently he's chosen a career in drugs... too bad but his choice. Could Cameron have done better? I guess we'll never know. Again, it was his choice not to do it. Maybe he said all he wanted to say in the first 2. He mixes effects and story better than most. It's usually one or the other and he is excellent at both, so yes, I think he was missed. Bottom line... T1 and T2 both had many scenes that are etched in my memory... T3 is missing that. There wasn't one scene that I will carry around with me. That being said... it also wasn't insultingly bad either... so I'd say it was good but not memorable. It had some holes but not enough to sink it. 7 out of 10..."

","Possible Spoiler alert.<br/><br/>This films biggest flaw is that it ignores the message from the first two, ""The Future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."" This film throws that concept out the window. The film's second biggest flaw is the ending, it's too indesicisive, Judgment Day still goes on despite all that happened in T2? Give me a break! Either make the bunker at the end the SkyNet Core, or at least the film shouldn't have foreshadowed that the future could be changed because at the end the future can't. Also what happened to Brad Fiedel's musical score? (Except during the end credits?) Also more of the future war would have been should have been shown besides the overhead shots that rolled before the opening credits. Dissapointing when compared to the first two. But to it's credit it did stick in a cameo from Earl Boen (Dr. Silberman) which was one of the very few redeeming features of the movie. Instead of this you should try wither one of the first two."

","This movie was quite satisfactory as an addition to the other two Terminator stories. The action sequences were exactly what one might expect, and the characterization was similarly as desired. Arnold especially shines in somewhat of an unintended comedic light.<br/><br/>But I couldn't help feeling like this movie was just a very expensive campaign ad in which time was being paid for by the minute in order to remind the people of California who Arnold is.<br/><br/>This movie runs just over an hour and a half and I felt that it was missing something. All the essential plot elements were there, but there was no detail. There were no sub-plots or interesting secondary characters, and the resolution was unnecessarily quick.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there was nothing superfluous in this movie. Every scene drove the action forward and provided entertainment in many forms. I just wish that, with the $200 million budget, they could have drawn it out a bit. Hopefully there will be another sequel soon in order to fulfill the missing element."

But it wasn't intended to be and IS a worthy sequel in what is now destined to be a continuing series.<br/><br/>The only thing that really kind of gets to me after a while is the virtually invulnerability of the Terminators.  Yes, they were designed to be unstoppable.  However, after a while it is kinda like watching a video game with a ""God Mode"" cheat code. Nothing can stop or hurt you, so why do they bother. <br/><br/>We have a BIG screen THX theater in our movie complex.  This, or a drive-in, is the place you need to see a movie like this or the Hulk for maximum effect.

"mf3177","8","0","0","2 July 2003"," He's Back!
","In Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, a film series is established that I never thought should have been established.  I've ranted in depth on my thoughts on The Terminator and its sequel on my webpage, and my hatred for the existence of said sequel should have been a deterrent in my preparation to see T3.  But my appetite for big-budget Schwarzenegger vehicles is one that must be fed, and Terminator 3 is the best tasting film Arnold's made in a while.<br/><br/>James Cameron moved on after directing the first two films, and the reigns are now taken by Jonathan Mostow.  Mostow wowed me previously with Breakdown, a B Movie so simple in plot and so tight in action that it held me in its grasp from opening to close.   Terminator 3 is definitely from the same mold.  The pacing is perfect, the action scenes are relentless, and the philosophical banter (thankfully there's little of it.I was petrified this would turn in to another Matrix Reloaded) is simple and fitting.  Mostow knows that a film like this, like a sorority babe, will not be looked at for its brains.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad thing.  The script allows Arnold to appear much more like a machine than the first sequel, limiting him to short lines that are usually so corny they work beautifully.  The aging Schwarzenegger shows that he has not lost his ability to carry an action film, although the lack of action from his character leaves us wondering how much is left in Arnold's tank. Hopefully we find out the answer in a different role.  More on that later.<br/><br/>Among the other key players, Nick Stahl (from In the Bedroom, which is an excellent movie) shines while taking over the role of John Conner, the future hero who needs protection.  The transition from the wide-eyed youth of Edward Furlong to the unaccepting adult is hard at first, but in the end Stahl's Conner is right on the money.  Claire Danes joins the fray as the love interest who also must be saved for mankind's sake, and is sufficient in her role.<br/><br/>The most publicized addition to the franchise has been Kristanna Loken as the female nemesis of the Terminator, the TX.  The TX model is much more impressive looking under fire than the similar model in T2.  I know many people will regard this as blasphemous, but that liquid metal on Robert Patrick looked LAME!  The TX has all the powers of her predecessor, but looks a lot better doing it.  I'm referring mostly to the special effects, but yeah, the female aspect is cool to see too.<br/><br/>The success however, lies in the direction.  Like Breakdown, Mostow masterfully crafts a film that manages to be both laid-back and wound-up at the same time, feeling simple in plot and hypercharged in activity.  It's not a masterpiece in any shape or form, but it did what I thought it could not - It made me care about John Conner again while keeping me gazing at the pretty explosions and collisions for almost two hours.<br/><br/>
I can't recommend Terminator 3 flat out.  It's too simple to be called anything more than a popcorn flick, and too basic in its action scenes to be called revolutionary in that aspect.  It does add some basic determinism for flavor, and there is a deeper message. But, in truth, T3 seems simply like a remix of the ideas that were used to make T2.  But it's a remix that doesn't succumb to too much `intelligence' like T2 did.  This is no substitute for the original.  But if I have to choose between the sequels, I'll take the powderkeg that is Terminator 3 in a heartbeat over the flashbomb that is Terminator 2.  Check it out.<br/><br/>P.S. - Love the Ending.  It had to take a lot of balls to put that on the screen.  Should be a fitting end to the series.I hope."
"bsdryn","Null","0","0","2 July 2003"," Great addition to the series
","I was skeptical about how good Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines would be. Sure, it's got Arnold, which is probably the most important factor. But there's no Linda Hamilton, no Eddie Furlong, and no James Cameron. He wrote and directed the first two. Could new people take over the series and do it justice? Well my fears were put to rest after tonight. T3 is awesome.<br/><br/>Even though the original date of Judgement Day has passed, John Conner is still struggling with his unknown destiny. But there's not a whole lot of time for philosophizing about fate and the nature of humanity. No need really, since that was already covered very well in T2. This film gets the action started early, and it's on full speed until the end. Everything is bigger here. You haven't seen a car chase until you see the massive action sequences here with so many oversized vehicles. I don't think I've ever seen so many broken windows, overturned cars, and explosions in one movie. The theater was shaking, and I was loving it.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of a sexy female Terminator, and not just because I'm a guy (although that helped). It made for interesting contrast to the previous villains of this series, and made a potentially similar sequel feel fresh. The T-X has all that liquid metal shape-shifting stuff mastered, not too mention plenty of new tricks up her sleeve. If Schwarzenegger wasn't such a cool hero, I would have easily rooted for the Terminatrix.<br/><br/>There's an awesome fight scene between the Terminators, T-X versus T-850. I've seen enough wire kung fu lately, so I really enjoyed this brutal fight where they literally throw each other through walls, floors, and anything else that looks painful. Plenty of computer graphics are implemented in the movie, but it is cleverly shot, and rarely noticeable. I doubt T3 will get the same ""cartoony video game"" complaints that plagued many Matrix Reloaded reviews.<br/><br/>If you like the previous Terminator flicks, and have an open mind about the new cast and director, you should have a great time. There's new catch phrases, as you'd expect. Some great moments of humor too, that really get a laugh against the otherwise serious tone. Your questions (Where's Sara? Why are the machines still rising? Why doesn't the Terminator remember John?) will be answered. And there's quite a few references to the older movies for those who really pay attention.<br/><br/>It's hard to say if Terminator 3 is better than T2. That 1991 film is a classic. Great story and ground breaking special effects. T3 isn't necessary to complete a trilogy, so it could have ended with T2. That's how James Cameron would have liked it. But T3 certainly doesn't feel like it was tacked on to the end of the series to make a buck. It fits very well with the other films, and shows off some incredible effects not possible 12 years ago. All the Terminator films have their own merits, so I can easily foresee my future. I am destined to one day purchase the 3 film DVD Terminator boxed set."

Surpisingly, it was awesome! Arnold was his same old, Kristanna Loken here was a better ""bad"" terminator than Robert Patrick in T2:Judgement Day, Nick Stahl did great job as a 20+  John Connor and Claire Daines, her humble self as usual, did a dignified supporting role as well. Good starcast, good action, smooth flow of the movie, ocassional wisecracks and ""not overdone yet superb"" special affects make this movie definitely enjoyable.<br/><br/>I was honored to see a sneak preview tonight, and indeed it was an honor. Everyone who came out of the 2 theater halls seemed content and satisfied with the third installment of Terminator. Mistow definitely did a good direction and James Cameron wasn't all that missed.

"superfurryraptor","4","0","0","2 July 2003"," Silly and Monotonous
","First off I must confess that I'm not a member of the church of Terminator. I was 5 years old when T2 came out and I missed out on all the hype and excitement surrounding its release. The first time I saw T2 was right before watching T3; I had seen the first movie before. On DVD and 12 years separated from the hype, T2 is a decent action movie but nothing more; I found James Cameron's attempts at creating human drama to be just as laughable as they were in Titanic. Because I wasn't really anticipating this movie, it wasn't a big deal to me when it turned out to be a dud (especially considering I got in free thanks to an employee friend's passes). If you are a fanboy, brace yourself; I haven't seen anything quite so hilarious and sad for quite some time as the shell-shocked, horrified look on the face of a man in the row behind me at the end of the movie; as everyone filed out, he stayed glued to his seat, his mouth slightly open, staring transfixed at the screen like it was some horrible train-wreck. I have a creeping suspicion he was praying for Ashton Kutcher to appear and scream ""YOU'VE BEEN PUNK'D BY THE PUNKERS ON MTV'S PUNK'D, PUNK!""<br/><br/>Before 1999, action movies were about big, brutal fights and explosions. On March 31, 1999, The Matrix slipped quietly into theaters and we all know what happened next. For better or for worse, T3 is a throwback film of sorts. There is, as in Matrix Reloaded, one huge car-chase set piece; it plays out more like director Jonathan Mostow challenging himself to see how much of the ridiculous $170 million budget he can spend blowing things up and knocking things over in a couple minutes, all while shaking the camera around and cutting quickly enough that you have only a faint inkling of what's going on. All the movie's action sequences play out like this; yes, the explosions are big, but none of it is terribly interesting or creative.<br/><br/>I'm not going to bother with the plot, which serves as a vehicle for 1) the effects and 2) the setup for a couple more of these movies than a story in its own right. What some will inevitably call a daring and imaginate shakeup of the Terminator mythos is more a necessarily overcomplex way to milk an artificial conflict out of a storyline that was concluded 12 years ago.<br/><br/>This is a franchise exercise and a calculated move, not a film. If that doesn't dissuade you from seeing it, since 90% of Hollywood's movies are that way, hopefully the fact that it's a bad one will."

Shows ya how often I get out.<br/><br/>I'm surprised that the theater wasn't jam-packed - I walked right in and hardly anyone was there at the 8 PM showing.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film with Nick Stahl (John Connor).  He portrayed Connor as I believe he should have been, but won't give any spoilers as yesterday was the first showing.  He definitely out-acted the pubescent Connor in T2.  Just the lack of the squeaky cracking voice was reason enough to like him! LOL<br/><br/>I can't say that Kristanna Loken (T-X) really had the latitude to do much with this role what with it being an emotionally void machine, but then again Arnold's T-100(?) had a lot more personality, if you will.  I don't think this is a 'spoiler' but I kept noticing how perfect Loken's T-X looked regardless of how often she met physical impacts - not a single hair was out of place!  I know, it's because she was a machine meant to look that way. Actually, I found it commendable that the production crew made certain that particular detail was not overlooked.  There's so much going on in this film that I'm sure many, including myself, will see it numerous times since I was so engrossed in it that it appeared to end too quickly.  Who knows, perhaps on DVD the deleted scenes and/or Director's Cut will make for even more an enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>Well, enough of that.

","Terminator 3 is really based on scripts that have been flying on net since 1999. Some of the scripts that this movie is mainly based are called T3:Armageddon and its many versions over the years.(Personally the older versions were great) Those scripts call for Arnold Terminator back right before skynet takes over and with Linda and young John he helps them to survive through nuclear holocaust and then fights along Johns side. Now the T3 movie itself is very close to this script. John is saved and Arnold terminator ensures John survives the holocaust but of course his mother is already dead for while. Anyways, the movie itself is on fast pace with battles between T-X and Arnold as John and his future wife(Claire) basically are running away. The action sequences are good. The best part of the movie is when skynet is turned on and together with interacion of the global virus it takes over. Early prototype machines take over in the military building that John gets to trying to prevent judgement day. That's when Arnold gets to fight his precedessors for once and not the advanced TX. Kick ass. However, I wish we would see more of the Skynet taking over. Further the scripts that have been flying on the net explained why Skynet computer system actually turns against humanity. In this movie its not explained, although if you read the scripts you would understand possibly what the virus really was:)(hacker who admires world power and have Hitler for his idol). But, back to the actual movie. It seems that instead of showing us the judgement day and post battle to save humanity Jonathan Mostow decides to widely extend the TX vs T101 battles and finishes the movie on guess what(judgement day) so it's a perfect setup for T4(post nuclear warfare between men and machine). This should and could have been succesfully done in one movie, T3, but at least T3 takes the right direction. I was afraid this movie is gonna bring another ending where they think they prevented judgement day, thank god they didn't."

","This is in no way a summary of the movie, merely a review.  Like all fans of the first two films, I really wanted to like this movie.  I thought the trailers sucked, but it seemed to be getting a positive reaction, so I watched it with an open mind.  Unfortunately my fears wear confirmed about 15 minutes into the movie, this one just plain sucks. Basically, if you're looking for your run-of-the-mill disposable Hollywood action crap, go see it, you'll enjoy it; everyone else, keep reading as to why this movie failed.<br/><br/>I will start with the pros of the film (there are only 4).  1. NICK STAHL, easily the best part of the movie, a great John Connor.  2.  THE END, shockingly it wasn't a happy one, but it seems forced and is too little too late.  3.  THE STORY, actually it wasn't that bad, but the execution was awful.  4.  SPECIAL EFFECTS, as always with Stan Winston, he delivers top notch make-up and FX.<br/><br/>On with the bad.  I know you weren't supposed to view this as a James Cameron film, but here's what I have to say to the people who think he's replaceable (this might be a stupid analogy, but I think it works).  When a band gets a new lead singer, everybody tries to make themselves believe it's the same band and just as good as the original, but it's not, most of the time it's subpar.  That's the problem with this movie, it's not Jon Mostow's fault, but he is not James Cameron.  James Cameron has a gift in delivering kick ass movies that center around story, not special FX, few can pull it off as is evidenced here.  Essentially, you don't HAVE to have Arnie to make a Terminator picture, but you HAVE to Cameron.  As I said the story wasn't that bad, but in the hands of Mostow it sucked.  Cameron could've done wonders with it.  You feel Mostow is just looking for another reason to blow s*** up rather than focusing on developing characters you care about.  You don't even care about Arnie in this movie cuzz he doesn't f***ing DO ANYTHING.  You really get the sense that the studio wanted a short combination of the first two films, nothing more, and that's exactly what you get.  No memorable scenes, a rehashed basic plot, a villain who is laughable, and lots of lame ass explosions.  I know it comes down to the almighty dollar and that's why this film was made, but for the love of God, I really feel that once the studio learned Cameron wanted nothing to do with it they should've stopped.  There's my two cents.  Just pray there's not a 4th."

","I'm just going to make this short for now because I am very tired.  I just came back from seeing the ""sneak preview"" and I have to say that this movie should have never been greenlit.  Most of Arnold's dialogue were horrible but that wasn't the biggest issue of the movie.  The main disappointment is the lack of a strong story.  With a better director this movie could have been significantly better.  T2 had a great story and ended perfectly. The story ended so well that it closed the story preventing the making of a sequel which obviously didn't happen.  The ending of the movie doesn't necessarily leave it open for a sequel but there is a chance that there could be.  And if there is a sequel I hope I would have the chance to direct it, which I highly doubt.  But it is nice to dream.  I already have an idea on a possible sequel that would have a strong story and would be able to close the saga. But anyway I do recommend this movie to fans of the previous films so your knowledge may expand on the Terminator universe."

","T3 was an amazing experience. I saw an advance screening of it tonight. I believe it surpasses it's expectations. Compared to The Terminator and T2, T3 is action-packed to the bone. Props go to the special effects team. I knew the action in the movie would be incredible. What I was concerned about coming into the theater was whether the plot would be strong or weak. After all, in T2, Judgment Day is prevented. Or is it? We learn early on in the movie that it's only delayed. The war with the machines is inevitable. The plot is complex but understandable. It's not like The Matrix Reloaded. Too keep things short and sweet, T3 spells the sad truth about mankind. The ending brings a tear to the eye. It made me think about how fragile life is. ""The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."" Think about it. Then go see T3."

","I can't believe it. After five years of reading through rumours and gossip, it has finally been unleashed. After a year of antcipating this movie and watching the previews over and over again ""it is time"". Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is here, and holy crap did come in style.<br/><br/>This movie blows all of the other summer movies away.<br/><br/>Before I go on, I must say this; MINOR SPOILERS (nothing drastic) will be given away.<br/><br/>The movie opens with John Connor now in his 20's. He's living off the radar, and moves around a lot. He sort of a has been now. Since they stopped Judgment Day from happening ten years previous, he has nothing to live for really. However, he's still paranoid and never forgets what his mom taught him. But now another, highly advanced terminator (Kristana Loken) has been sent back to, well, terminate him. The T-X, as it's called, goes around and kills all of John's future Lieutenants. The T-X also goes after a girl named Kate Brewster (Claire Daines) who we find out has a very important role in the future war. The Human Resistance was able to send back another Terminator (Schwarzenegger) to protect Connor and Brewster. But which one will reach him first?<br/><br/>Now, I'll get to the good stuff in awhile but first I want to mention the casting. The casting of Nick Stahl as Connor was great. I first saw Stahl in the Mel Gibson directed movie The Man With-out A Face. Then Stahl was just a kid, but he did a great job in the role he played. Stahl replaces Edward Furlong in the role of Connor and he does a great job at it. His performance is brilliant and the way he captures the character of a guy who knows that the world could be destroyed at anytime is excellent.<br/><br/>The casting of Claire Daines as Kate Brewster was a smart move as well. I can't actually think of any other actress who would fit in this role. As much as I like Natalie Portman, I don't think she would have been believable in this role, and it would have just been her doing her Star Wars bit again. Daines and Stahl have some great chemistry on screen together and that really helps the movie. That's one thing that can always hurt a movie if people are supposed to like each other. Bad chemistry is noticeable, and it distracts from the picture.<br/><br/>Now onto the choice role of the T-X, Kristana Loken. While she doesn't play the character as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000 character in T2, she does do a good job, at being the, sort of, innocent cute girl. She actually surprised me and did a good job. She's not a scary character, which is a shame, but she's a tough one. I wasn't to keen on the idea of a female terminator, I though it would be handled wrong, but I was wrong. I suppose that's what I get for under-estimating Jonathan Mostow, who did good job with this movie.<br/><br/>Sure T3 isn't as good as the first two. I didn't expect it to be, and it doesn't bother me. First of all, it's a different director and writers. The James Cameron Terminator movies are far superior to this one, but this one is still a worthy sequel.<br/><br/>Mostow, who directed the great Kurt Russell thriller 'Breakdown' and the tense submarine thriller 'U-571', handles this movie really well. He pays homage to the original Terminator movies as well as adding his own spin on it.<br/><br/>This one isn't as 'dark' as the other ones were, but it still works. I have said for awhile now, that this movie will either crush Mostow's career, or give him the respect he deserves. And it looks like I'm right.<br/><br/>
Mostow has an eye for action, and a well placed eye that is. Most of the action in this movie is way better than most of the other action in any of the previous summer action movies.<br/><br/>And another good thing is it never lets up. The action just keeps coming. What a thrill ride. The massive car chase near the beginning was brilliant. I said the Matrix: Reloaded car chase was good, but this one is far better, mainly because it uses REAL cars and real stunts. It doesn't rely on CGI to make explosions and cars crash.<br/><br/>The first car chase, or rather truck chase, is fun and thrilling. It involves a crane truck and Arnie chasing the T-X on a police motorcycle. It's too much to talk about it, but it's great. What I also liked about this chase was something very subtle. The chase started a night, but it ended during the day. I loved the fact that Mostow decided to have the sun come up during the chase. I don't know why. Probably because most car chases either happen during the day or night, never in between. It was a nice touch. Lame I know, but I liked it.<br/><br/>The rest of the action is skillfully done and it was some neat stuff to see. A fight between the Terminator and the T-X had me worried for a minute that Woman's Rights Activists might sue the studio because of the beating Arnie gives the female T-X. But then she fought back, so I guess it evens the score.<br/><br/>Also, I must mention Stan Winston. He worked on the previous two Terminators and even won an Academy Award for make-up and special effects on T2. He returns here, and does a stellar job. I love seeing the battle damage on the Terminator, with the Terminator skeleton popping out and flesh still hanging on. It's really neat make-up and job well done. I think another Academy Award might in sights for Winston.<br/><br/>Now there was a lot of humour in this one. I laughed at a lot of it, and it was nice to kind of see Arnie play around and make fun of himself on screen. Like just after he gets his outfit and what he does. It was stupid, but I will admit, I laughed. It was harmless, but it could have done with-out it.<br/><br/>Now, there were some things that I didn't like about T3. Yes, I know, hard to believe, eh? I didn't like some of the dialogue. It was weak at times, but all the goodness about this movie makes up for all the bad.<br/><br/>I also didn't like the fact the classic Terminator theme was absent through out the whole movie. Now Marco Beltrami did a god job composing the movie. The soundtrack was great, it's just, I missed that Terminator theme. It's such an awsome theme, how could he not use it? Sure it appears in the end credits, but still?<br/><br/>The story moves along at break neck pace and keeps rolling and rolling. The movie does slow down from time to time to explain things and further the story as well. I don't want to say anything about the story in general, but what I will say is that it's pretty good.<br/><br/>In Roger Ebert's review he said `The ending must remain for you to discover, but I will say it seems perfunctory'. I disagree. I liked the ending. As did Ebert's reviewing buddy Richard Roeper. It does leave questions out there, but it also seems to say that, no matter how much we try, we are always doomed. You can't stop something from happening that's supposed to happen, you can only postpone it, and wait until it arrives to do what your fate has chosen for you to do.<br/><br/>The ending was good. I liked it. I don't care what anyone says about it, it was good.<br/><br/>So, now my closing comments, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a summer action movie that delivers. It doesn't have a complicated storyline that makes you stop paying attention and makes you just want to leave the theatre so bad (Matrix Reloaded). It doesn't rely heavily on CGI like the Matrix did, and when it has CGI, its damn good. It's not as noticeable or poorly done like the Matrix and Hulk were. It also has non-stop great action.<br/><br/>It's a great movie and I know I've said this before, but I recommend seeing this. Go buy a ticket, buy some popcorn sit down and enjoy the lame, but fun, humour, the action and spectacular visuals.<br/><br/>I have to say it, but Arnold is back everyone, and he's back in full force. Terminator 3 is here, and now its time for King Conan."

Cameron's presence was missed on this film, but Mostow did a job well done and can hopefully spawn a sequel of two off this story line.

","*Spoliers* I just got back from seeing T3 tonight.  At first I was not sure whether I really loved it or I really hated it.   I have since decided on the former.  I went into the movie with a very hopeful yet skeptical attitude.  Ok, the movie.  At first I was afraid that my fears were coming true (the stupid sunglasses, talk to the hand - which actually was incredibly funny to me). The T-X made me quite sketical at first because she is so hot that I could not think of her being a mean ass. Then when she connects to the net through her phone I thought ""oh d*mn."" From then on out she is a bad*ss.  The chase through LA is hands down awesome.  Much better than the Matrix Reloaded chase (though not as long).  The Terminator is very good.  If a little more emotive than he should be.  Things about the movie that I really loved: Skynet coming online was so cool. There really wasnt much to it, but just knowing that it was happening was so cool. Conner realizing that judgement day cannot be averted was very good.  I also liked how the machines came to realize that just as judgement day itself could not be avoided, neither could John Conner, so instead they aim at the less important parts in an attempt to lessen the sum - the future generals that serve under Conner. At first I did not like how the movie ended, with the bombs dropping right at the end.  But in retrospect I think it was good that way.  However, it also necessitates another sequel.  I was sorta hoping for some closure.  But I was also itching to see everything blow up. Which also did not really happen.  But I guess that really was not all that necessary. There were a few other bad things.  First of all, there was just a little too much corny humor. Some would have been good, but not as much as was in there.  The sarah conner part was rather lame, in my opinion.  I wish they would have explained some more how the main players all happened to find there way together at the kennel.  The movie sorta throws out the whole ""no fate but what we make"" thing.  However, I think that is a good thing though. Lastly, I was hoping that Mostow would throw in something about Uncle Bobs left over arm at the end of T2.  All that being said, I am very pleased with this movie. 9 out of 10."

","Moviegoing auidences have been waiting twelve years for Arnold Schwarzenegger to come back to the role that made him famous and the question remains; was it worth the wait? For me the answer is yes and no. First I'll focus on the yes part of the movie. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines delivers it's share of action and special effects which in the summer time is why we go to the movies. Nick Stahl whose is  a very talented actor takes the role of John Connor from Edward Furlong and does it well. And the T-X played by the sexy Kristanna Loken is meancing and a smooth bad ass bad guy. Fianlnly Jonathan Mostow handles the action sequences very well in the film. The chase sequence in the film is one of the best I've seen from the three movies he's directed . Now let's focus on the no part of Terminator 3 that will upset many moviegoers. Terminator 3 has two main probelms that makes the film pale in comparison to it's precassadors. The first being the lack of storytelling that trio of screenwriters John Brancato,Michael Ferris and Tedi Sarafian can't seem to capture that Cameron magic which affects the direction of the talented Mostow. The second problem is the familar score by composer Brad Fiedel which is gone from this film. When it comes to the females in the film Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken both kinda gives a paper thin performances. Danes over does the damsel in distress role and Loken is nothing more than eye candy (but damn does she look good). The film won't please all tastes but if you want mindless entertainment then check this one out. Hopefully the inevitable Terminator 4 with Nick Stahl in the lead will be an improvement over this one. It's not that Terminator 3 is a bad film it just wasn't worth a 12 year wait. Mt final verdict on the film is ** 1/2 stars."

","****Plot Points In This Review****<br/><br/>I went into Terminator 3 with high hopes and high expectations.  What I left with, was the same feeling I had after viewing Alien 3 for the first time. It had somehow accomplished nothing more than tarnishing the two films that had come before it. Through two Terminator films, we were led to believe that things that happen in the future could be changed, that certain things didn't have to be inevitable.  With Terminator 3, we find out that was all nonsense, that there was no reason for the existence of the first two movies at all, because what's going to happen is going to happen and you can't do a darn thing about it. (just delay it for a while till we can get the next movie made).  So what we end up with is three movies from the George Lucas School of prequels, though we didn't know it till now.  Thanks, but no thanks for cluing us in.<br/><br/>There are plenty of exciting action and chase sequences in the film, and they do grab your attention while they are on the screen.  Still, they are nothing more or less than we've seen in any other Summer Blockbuster, so I can't recommend seeing this movie on that alone.  Schwarzenegger does his usual fine one note job as The Terminator, but Nick Stahl's John Connor is so wimpy, we long for Edward Furlong to pop up and give him a swift kick in the pants.  Clare Danes as Kate Brewster, Connor's future wife, is by far more interesting, and you begin to wonder how John Connor and not her ever became the one to lead the rise against the machines.  It almost makes you glad that in the future a Terminator does take out John Connor.  I for one would feel a lot better about it if Kate were leading my revolution. Kristana Lokken, despite not having much to do except morph, is menacing enough, but no more or no less than Robert Patrick was in the previous film. She just has the advantage of having a few more tricks up her sleeve.<br/><br/>Will there ever be a Terminator 4?  Could happen I suppose, if this one makes the major dollars as the previous films did.  Trouble is, we now know the ending, and as in the Star Wars prequels, when you know what is going to happen, getting there just isn't that much fun anymore."

","Spoilers Warning...<br/><br/>Terminator 3 defies logic on so many levels.  First of all, I have the same initial question with T-3 that I did with T-2.  Why on earth does the future John Connor (or military personnel) continue to send old, obsolete model cyborgs to save him in the past?  Wouldn't it make sense to send the same updated, slicker model that was sent to kill him?  And why does the female T-X pump up her clevage to flirt with a cop?  Isn't she the Terminator?? Why does she need tricks to get his gun?  Just take it like you do everything else!  Speaking of the cop's gun, why does she even need a gun? Her arm can shape into a gun, a rocket launcher, and a flame thrower.  And why does she need to taste a bloody woman and bloody gauze pad to identify people?  Isn't her tongue made from the same synthetic material her finger is?  She should taste it as soon as she sticks her finger in it.  She also murders a guy in a drive thru burger joint, but the window is on the right hand side.  Why?  Isn't this America?? And what happened to her mission to destroy John Connor's future lieutenants?  She abandons that idea early on and decides to pursue John Connor and his future wife for the duration of the movie.<br/><br/>T-3 is a poor movie with a convoluted plot, uneven pacing and boring action. The ending is anti-climatic and the film in general feels small and incomplete.  It ends with a door open for a sequel, but I am not looking forward to it.  T-3 is simply garbage."

","So here's the thing... Jonathan Mostow is a good director, and T3 is aa good movie. Mostow however, is not James Cameron, and T3 is half the film that T2 is.<br/><br/>T3 reminded me of The Matrix Reloaded: Awesome special effects, robotics and CGI. Great editing. Poor story. T3 has no heart, no real substance. Fans will be suprised by the twist-ish ending, but this film did little to move me emtionally, as T2 did.<br/><br/>I was only 11 when T2 came out. It remains pretty much my favorite film, and I compare its perfection to everything I see today. T2 is stylized and smooth. In the early days of computer generated images, T2 blew my mind with its then-new morphing technology. The T-1000's morphs were so smooth, so fluid, and so simple. While T2 had a lot of effects shots, it focused mainly on the morphing, which made it all the more impressive. Less is more, no?<br/><br/>I read somewhere that T3 had 400-500 effects shots, and as in Reloaded, it was overkill. There was very little dialogue, and the relationship between John Connor and the Terminator is barely showcased. The real star or T3 is the TX. I sat in a theater with about 200 horny straight college guys, and undoubtedly, their favorite part was the shot of the TX's boobs.<br/><br/>
T3 relied heavily on cliched and corny humor. In one scene, the Terminator puts his hand up to a cop and says (In Ah-nuld voice) ""Talk to da hand."" Of course, it was funny, but pretty disappointing.<br/><br/>Everytime I watch T2, I am fozen by the scene in which the Terminator tells John Connor that it is in man's nature to destroy himself. This powerful message has stayed with me to this day, and I can safetly state that Terminator 3 is a poor follow up to Terminator 2.<br/><br/>Overall: (3 out of 5)<br/><br/>Cast: 3 (And 2 are for Arnold) Visuals: 4 (Too many CGI shots!) Sound: 3 (I didn't like the mix) Plot: 1 (LAME, lame, lame) Stylization: 2 (Typical half-assed 2003 movie) Effects: 5 (I love REAL robots. Lots in this film!)"
"Starving_Screenwriter","8","0","0","1 July 2003"," No fate but what we make or inevitability?
","I've loved the first two (especially the second) Terminator movies ever since I can remember.  I was only six years old when I saw the first one. This was because my parents left us with a babysitter who was not supposed to show us the film, but did anyway.  If I still knew who that man was I would thank him today because at age six I was scared of the Terminator but loved Arnold Schwarzenegger.  He is still my favorite actor today.<br/><br/>In the first two, the story is very similar, but the second movie gets deeper in thought.  The quote, ""There is no fate but what we make for ourselves"" was a theme, so to speak, and it worked well.  The machines sent a Terminator through time to change what the future had brought. Apparently John Connor is supposed to be the leader of the human race, and the machines feel he is going to be there demise.  Since he is such a powerful leader in the future, they feel it be best to go back in time to destroy him before he becomes such an influential and strong man.  In each movie the Terminator fails, but the machines appear to become more advanced (since model 101 was replaced with 1000 from the first to the second).  At the end of T2, we get the idea that it must be the end, and Judgment Day was no longer in the world's future.<br/><br/>Enter Terminator 3.  The ""theme"" in this movie is almost a contradiction to T2's theme.  (semi-spoiler)  The Terminator explains to John that Judgment Day is inevitable, and that John's fate is to become the leader of the human race.  Therefore no matter what they do Judgment Day is still going to happen.  The one thing that confused me was the fact that there was still a Terminator sent back to try and destroy John Connor.  If the future is inevitable, then why send a machine back when they know it's not going to work?  Maybe the idea that the future happens only one way is not true, but rather just a speculation.  Whatever the outcome may be, the machines do realize the importance of John Connor and will try almost anything to terminate him.<br/><br/>The end of the movie was great, and I was quite amazed and shocked at it. I wasn't expecting it at all, but loved it just the same.  The movie is also great because it lives up to the Terminator name.  The special effects are mind-blowing and the scenes are intense.  If you liked T2, you should definitely not wait to see this one.  Besides, you want to see the fourth one as well, don't you?  You decide, is it fate or inevitability that Terminator 4 will be in our future?"

","This review does not contain any spoilers, please don't worry about my ruining the film for you. The Film itself is a spoiler!<br/><br/>I grew up loving the first and second films, high quality writing made up for the first film's lack of a budget, and with the second film the original author's came back and did themselves proud, by keeping it up. They knew the film would be a spectacular hit and decided to go for broke, on not just the effects, but they kept up the quality of the exposition. In 1991 we all went to the theater in our town and sat back for what was truly an enjoyable evening of Sci-Fi smash bang Fun. It truly was just that. James Cameron and William Wisher actually cared about keeping up the level of storytelling that the first film started. They are to be commended for this. The third (and by extension) the fourth installments are quite obviously the result of focus groups and Corporate decision making, they squeezed out the truly creative people behind the first films (except Arnold & Stan Winston) and what is left on the screen is truly sad, rehash rehash and more rehash. Once I had heard the news that Cameron and Wisher would not be involved, I started having doubts, but never the less I went to the theater with and open mind. It was less than an hour into the screening (Sneak Preview) 7-1-03 that I found myself looking at my watch to see how long the film had been so far. This is not a good sign. We all know that a good and inte resting ""Movie"" draws you in and makes you forget you are watching a film. Terminator 3 rise of the Machines fails to do that. This films constant reliance on humor and big budget effects don't make up for the fact that the writers wrote a scrictly formula flick here. I'm genuinly surprised that Arnold did not refuse to do this film without good creative support, but a 30 million dollar paycheck is hard to turn down. That brings up another question the studios were willing to spring for Arnold, so why not all of the other fine actors that should have been a part of this. Paramount made the same mistakes with its 5th (and worse) of the Star Trek flicks (""If you slap it together-They will come) Put a Big Name Star in front of us and we will mindlessly fork over our hard earned cash to see it. Hollywood needs to learn this lesson again folks, a true fan of the Terminator films will know what I'm talking about.

And it's unfortunate that during those twelve years very little creativity went in to crafting the story for this latest installment of the Terminator saga. Don't get me wrong - T3 is a perfectly serviceable summer action movie, full of the requisite stunts and ""how'd they do that"" effects we've come to expect.  But you can't help getting a ""same old, same old"" vibe as you watch the movie unfold.<br/><br/>The movie is essentially a competently directed, paint-by-numbers and somewhat tighter-paced retelling of Terminator 2.  All the elements are there - Arnie arriving naked and getting his leather clothes, check.  The evil terminator also arriving naked and killing some people without mercy, check.  Slow-motion shot of Arnie when he first meets young John Connor, check.  Extended driving sequence in the desert, check.  Massively destructive truck and bike chase through L.A., check.  Against better judgment, going back into the heart of the beast to try and stop the rise of Skynet, check.  The few new twists that are thrown into the mix, notably the Claire Danes character of Kate Brewster and the new Arnie's relationship with the new John Connor, attempt to shake things up but don't really succeed in lifting the veil of staleness.  Notably absent is the emotion of the second film, as the pace never slows enough to allow the characters a moment to breathe, let alone relate to one another.<br/><br/>It seems that the story began with the creation of the newest nemesis in the saga, the T-X, and grew around that.  She's basically a distaff version of Robert Patrick's T-1000 with a few new surprising powers (which aren't exploited nearly enough).  Newcomer Kristanna Loken is appropriately menacing and relentless but does little to really distinguish herself in the role.  She's certainly a sexy lady but it seems that any one of a hundred gorgeous blond actresses could have done the part with the same results. Some sharper writing, more dialogue and even a more emotive T-X could have created a more original and more memorable villainess, instead of a mere T-1000 retread (albeit a more curvaceous one).  As she is, the character of the T-X mirrors the rest of the film, and it feels like a wasted opportunity.  However, Hollywood always has trouble creating great female villains who aren't over-the-top campy, too mannish or overtly nymphomaniacal, so there are no surprises that this is another failure.<br/><br/>Overall, the best that can be said about Terminator 3 is that it is an adequate film.  Some amusing moments, some entertainment, but nothing groundbreaking, nothing truly imaginative.  Sticking to the formula for safety's sake.  If there is a sequel (and without giving too much away, it can be said that the end of this one practically guarantees it) it would be nice to see a completely fresh take on the saga instead of going for the usual two-robots-come-back-through-time, one-to-destroy one-to-protect formula that has with this movie been drained of all its creative juice."

","I strongly suspect the prior commenter either has a specific financial stake or is otherwise tied to the ""biz.""  Straight up, this is a light and entertaining film.  I don't feel ripped off, but I won't give a strong recommendation to my friends.<br/><br/>On a plot level... To me, T1 was gripping.  It generated fear.  I would not use those terms for T2, but there was still some intrigue and uncertainty, and some angles to the plot.  T3 didn't have any of that.  No one in my theater feared the villain or expected it to succeed.  In fact, even when the plot placed the bad guy in a close position to Terminate (within 10 feet SEVERAL times!), nonchalance followed, permitting escape.  Obviously in T1 the villain was relentless and unwavering.  Though I felt T2's villain was not as terrifying, I must give that he was relentless and if he got close he would execute immediately.  Yet in T3 - I just have to call it nonchalance. Not scary at all!<br/><br/>Arnold holds up his end and if he's what floats your boat you'll be fine with this.  But make no mistake - this is not James Cameron level material. It's not awful, but don't expect anyone to be swept off their feet by this.<br/><br/>One more technical note: if you don't instantly recognize the opening and closing theme music from T1, disregard this.  I would say to the directors and producers of T3: shame on you.  Brad Fiedel's composition would have lifted this whole affair - as great scores can, turning scenes into emotional experiences - but Brad and Cameron will do doubt share their quality in other projects down the road :)"

","THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR HAS ARRIVED!  This was an absolute excellent movie and perfect new addition for the Terminator series.  The style and editing is kept in line with the previous' films design yet is expanded upon through action that is not-stop and unlike anything you've ever seen.  Besides that, THE SCRIPT IS BRILLANT.  It clears up ALL the plot holes you may have been wondering about from previous films such as ""How the heck can a whiny civilian kid end up being the future leader of the human military resistance?"" and ""Does a 'terminator' being sent back to the past change the future timeline everytime one is sent back?"".  The new characters perfectly fit the series and add incredible character development and archs to their personality.  T3 is an absolutely vital addition to the series and features SOME OF THE BEST ACTION SEQUENCES EVER CAPTURED ON FILM.  It also has a major emotional pull and some great dramatic scenes as characters live, die, and go through major changes before your eyes.  The acting is top-notch. Expect Loken and Stahl to become major stars after this one.  There are many twists and turns along the way too - THIS IS JUST ONE ROLLERCOASTER RIDE THAT NEVER LETS UP!  GO SEE IT AS MANY TIMES AS YOU CAN - YOU'LL LOVE IT!"

","but leaves too many plot holes unfilled.  No shortage of action or Arnold one-liners.  The story is plausible, and is an interesting twist (especially the end) to the saga.

","I had low expectations for this film. I thought Nick Stahl would fail as John Connor, Kristanna Loken would fail as a beleivable villian and the plot would be cheesier than the Hulk's, but I was mistaken about all of the above. The action was up to par with T2, and the plot did not disappoint. The T-X was not as imposing as the T-1000, but still a formidable foe. And although I did not forsee this as a possibility, a Terminator 4 would suit me just fine. It's good to see Arnold back in the saddle."

","Terminator 3 deserves its place beside Terminator 1 and 2 as the great cinematic epic that it is.<br/><br/>I entered T3 with zero expectations.  I left feeling relieved and overjoyed -- ""they did it,"" was my only thought.  ""They made the sequel I would have made.""  And they really did.<br/><br/>Whatever the critics say, know this: even James Cameron approves of Terminator 3.  It carries his vision forward perhaps as faithfully as he himself would have done.  There is the landmark humor, action, and, above all -- story.<br/><br/>I have read complaints, from some critics, who seem to think T3 was meant to be a perpetually extended version of its predecessor, T2.  No.  T3 is in new hands; spawned entirely by new brains.  The ideas are fresh, and the scope? -- Extraordinary.<br/><br/>It is perhaps the best Terminator movie yet."

","I was able to see Terminator 3 in an early screening.  I had been waiting 12 years to see this movie.  This was the equivalent of a new Star Wars movie to me.  Of course jumped at the chance to see it early.<br/><br/>I must say that I was disappointed.  The movie was obviously not directed or written by the notoriously anal and creative James Cameron.  The first two movies were very plot driven which made them fantastic science fiction/thriller/action movies.  This was driven mostly by the goal of having large chase scenes and setting up the possibility of a sequel. The story didn't flow and felt forced at points. Some scenes were very cool, and the acting of Claire, Arnold, and the female terminator was very good.  The new John Conner left something to be desired. Overall the movie was fun to watch because Arnold is always fun to watch as the terminator, however I didn't find it very thought provoking at all. And the ending surprised me.  I won't give it away, but I didn't expect what happened to happen. But go see it for yourself.  Maybe James Cameron will come back to do the fourth."

","It is plain and simple. Terminator 3 far exceeded my expectations...<br/><br/>Looking at the figures, the film was not directed by James Cameron, not composed by Brad Fidel, had hardly any of the same actors in it and yet...was amazing.<br/><br/>This film contained some of the greatest action sequences seen on screen, was well acted, and had enough plot twists to keep up both the physical and psychological attraction of the viewer.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest attribute of Terminator 3, is that the film pays tribute and recognizes its roots. Many of the situations in this film are similar, yet do not simply repeat the formula of the first two films. Yet, at the same time the plot recognizes and uses all of the elements of the Terminator story to create a realistic, exciting, and ultimately depressing film which will be sure to stand the test of time for many years to come."

","This movie is the epitome of how bad sequels can get and just how good James Cameron really is! The movie utterly spits in the face of T2 with carbon-copy sequences (opening scene, cemetery shootout, and the tanker chase) that reek of campy humour. Just take a look at Earl Boen's character who was given a rude awakening in T2, much to audiences' satisfaction, and in T3 is brought in for a quick cameo that completely mocks his role in Judgment Day! And for the biggest shame of all: the Terminator is no longer an unstoppable, ultra-violent, killing machine, but a one-liner spouting gentle giant! And the TX! Well if trying to imitate Robert Patrick's vicious T-1000 (and poorly, at that) and inflating one's bust while wearing tight leather is scary, than slap me senseless because I was too busy laughing! And let's not forget the complete lack of interesting characters and a story that at least concludes instead of opening up room for ANOTHER sequel! Maybe that sequel will be written and directed by James Cameron, star Linda Hamilton, and maybe even bring back the drama from T1 & 2."

Excellent story, great acting (especially the T-X), and an absolutely amazing ending.  Kristanna Loken builds upon Robert Patric's emotionless killer T1000, and makes the T-X one of the best evil nemesis's ever.  Arnie looks great.  Other than the story, the thing that really stands out is the effects.  Rather than relying on CG, the majority of the action scenes have the look and feel of reality, whether they're created by miniatures, or good old-fashioned stuntwork.  Jonathan Mostow has done the series proud, let's hope T4 isn't too far off."

","T3 was a decent film despite the fact that I entered the theater with the false pretense that Mostow would be able to imitate Cameron's style in T1 and T2.  The only reason I could see the need to have a Terminatrix was for the sex appeal.  Had Robert Patrick (T- 1000) been brought back, the film would've been equally good, if not better. There were definitely some moments where Ahnold's one-liners were just hilarious. I would've liked to have seen a slightly stronger ending.  You'll never forget Sarah Connor driving off into the desert, or Ahnold sticking up his thumb as he's getting submerged in the hot steal.  But nukes being launched everywhere?<br/><br/>Not sure if this will conclude the Terminator legacy, but if they do make another one, I'll definitely go see it."
"IMSandman","10","0","0","2 July 2003"," Great 3rd Movie!!! Go see it!!!
","I just got back from seeing T3 and it was all it was hyped up to be and then some.   The action sequences in this movie are outstanding.  It is great to see a movie that relies more on stunts (whenever possible) than special effects for a change.  <br/><br/>The movie takes place from where the last movie left off and stays in context with the storyline from the previous movies.  <br/><br/>T3 also provides more ""comic relief"" than the previous two.  While some of the jokes were very cheesy, they were well placed and provided some humor to the film, similar to something out of the Indiana Jones' series. <br/><br/>
The female terminator was a good villain (and hot).   The action sequence where Arnold gets ripped through a building on a crane is one of the best ""chase"" scenes in recent memory.  A bit of trivia is that the movie was overbudget and Arnold paid $1.4 million out of his own pocket to have the scene shot.  <br/><br/>Finally, the best part of the movie, and the reason why I am giving this movie such a high score, is the ending.   The ending is brilliant and I would encourage you to see the movie as quickly as possible before someone ruins the ending for you.  <br/><br/>Placing this movie in the action genre, I would have to give it 10 stars since this movie certainly fits in the categorial rating of ""excellent."" The action is exciting and original, the plot is solid and the ending is outstanding.   Alliteration:  Another Amazing Arnold Action Adventure."

","Ok, I expected this movie to be a total flop, and I was wrong.  It had good action sequences, a tolerable plot, and decent acting.  Overall I enjoyed it.  Will I see it again, though?  Probably not.  The first Terminator movie was revolutionary because of its effects and its plot; I thought it was far ahead of its time.  The second movie, while nothing exceptional in the story department, had some great performances, and completely over the top action, simply because of the number of memorable sequences.  The visuals were amazing, and come on...the T1000 has to be one of the greatest ""silent"" villains ever seen on the screen.  Here, T3 lags far behind; in no way does it push the envelope compared to other current movies.  The action, while well done, is nothing new.  The characters are no longer memorable; the new Terminator is nowhere as cool in concept or on screen as the T1000.  The movie also lacks the grand scope of the first 2; it feels short.  In fact, it feels mostly like a set-up for another sequel, this time finally taking us into the actual war."

","I've seen Matrix, X-men, the Hulk, and even Finding Nemo.  I loved all these movies, but I think that T3 is the best movie of the summer.  It had a better story than the Hulk, more action packed than X2 and more consistent(computer graphic wise) than Matrix.<br/><br/>It was exciting from the very begin.  The first car chase seen was jaw dropping.  I swear my mouth was opened the whole time from amazement. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time. Most of the computer graphics actually looked real.  There are very few movies that have looked as good.<br/><br/>There are problems though. It is not as good as the first two.  Allow there are better action scenes, the character development is lacking. In T2, you can sense a closeness between Arnold and John, but it just wasn't there in T3.  Also there was little chemistry with John and lover interest Claire Danes.  Danes is also suppose a close relationship with her father in the movie, but they don't develop it enough for you to care.<br/><br/>Despite that it is a well made movie.  My advice, if you want a story as good as the first two, don't go.  This movie is not going to win any oscars. If you love a good action movie, this is a must see."

","My hat is off to Mr. Jonathan Mostow, who does an admirable job in following up James Cameron in the newest addition to the Terminator franchise. Made twelve years after the the previous, which was made seven years after the original, The Terminator keeps coming back for more, this time in the form of a woman Terminatrix (played by Kristanna Loken).  John Connor (Nick Stahl) must once again be protected, this time by not only the Terminatrix, but also from Judgement Day. Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) is also under the protection this time around by Ahnuld. <br/><br/>The action sequences in the movie are tremendous, showing us all what the reported $170 million budget was used for, especially the chase scene early on in the movie. <br/><br/>Without going into too many specifics, I found this movie to be especially enjoyable because it took risks. You will not understand what I mean until you see the movie, but the writers and director took some chances with this movie; something that is rare for a movie with such an enormous production budget.

Oh, and by the way, the story was pretty good too with a little twist at the end. When I go into a movie I don't nitpick- I just want to have a good time. Only fairies nitpick....

The original trailers for this film didn't alter that impression.  I had the feeling it was going to be lackluster.<br/><br/>Was I ever wrong.<br/><br/>The Story starts with ominous music by Marco Beltrami, quite a departure from the classic Terminator Score by Bad Fiedel, but it's fitting, after all this is a new story arc.

It was not as good as Terminator 2. The movie lacked a few things to make me say it was one of the best movies ever (as T2 is my favorite movie of all time). The biggest item it was missing was the depth of Terminator 1 and 2. It was missing a soul. The movie seemed REALLY fast, the first 30 minutes were paced very well and then it was sent into overdrive from there. Arnold's character of the T-101 was good, but come on, way too many funny lines and he's not as ruthless as he should be!  My biggest complaint though is the music.

I thought Edward did a terrible job in T2 - Nick portrays the character awesomely - Danes does a good job also.  I do miss Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn though.  The stunts and effects are astounding - I actually saw stunts performed that haven't been done before in all other general action flicks.  Overall - I was very impressed with the cast - I thought it would have been more effective to have used Vin Diesal or someone else as the other terminater besides the female.

James Cameron, the director of the first two Terminator movies was not going to direct this one, and the actress who was playing Sarah Connor said she didn't want to return.  I have to admit also that when the first T3 trailer came out i booed it(as did many other people who were there that night.)  But soon the trailers kept looking better and better and i thought maybe it wasn't going to be so bad.  Still though i kept low expectations(which i think every fan should have of cult movies). I saw it today, and it keeps getting better and better to me as time goes on. Although it repeats many things from the first two, i think it was well done, especially in SFX dept. Any fan of terminator should see this, and although it's not as good as the first two, it's worthy of the terminator name."

","This movie is precariously balanced between being a hit and being a flop. Here's why; its a good story, with great special effects, however, it lacks significant new intrique.  The movie has also come on the scene late.  The Terminator audience may have lost contact.  Although, I didn't.  If you enjoyed the prior two movies, you should enjoy this one as well.  I don't know; however, if you need to see it more than once. I am debating on seeing it again."

Another issue is T3 reckons many T2 set ups, though with some interesting twist, which is not bad.<br/><br/>The movie is not very long, thus lucks some insight development of how and what is the future.

"Barry_the_Baptist","6","0","0","2 July 2003"," Brilliance is irrelevant; a serviceable action film.
","Given all the impropitious factors that were stacked against this latest installment I think the film works reasonably well and has at least the visceral appeal that a 170 million dollar blockbuster should have. Yes it lacks the artistry and elan that Cameron brought to the first two installments and yes it does simply rehash and expand previous action sequences that made the first two films so enjoyable. However I found the acting to be serviceable and the human element was palpable enough to the point where it did not feel like a completely boneheaded action film. My main qualm with the characters was with the TX who was not fleshed out enough and not nearly as menacing as the T-1000 from the second film. The majority of the action sequences serve to simply entertain us and do so in spades. However they were also a way to mask the fact that the story was incredibly thin and the dialogue laconic and derivative of the popular catch phrases established in the first two films. But in conclusion it must be noted that outside of the context of the first two films this is a summer action movie that entertains and even makes fun of itself to the joy of the viewer. The action thankfully does not really too heavily on CGI effects and ends up boing much more entertaining than 'The Matrix Reloaded' or 'The Hulk' by action standards. Compared with the first two films it is no more than a road movie with action sequences and minimal sci-fi elements thrown in. Not entirely forgettable but the second one is still by far the finest of the three. 6 out of 10, worth a look for entertainment purposes."

","I didn't really know what to expect from ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"".  I hadn't hyped myself up for it, being that I loved ""T1"" and liked ""T2"".  So I went to see it today and I was pretty blown away by it. Clearly James Cameron, who directed both ""T1"" and ""T2"", is not here to direct ""T3"".  Jonathan Mostow, who I have never heard of until this film, really knows how to direct a ""Terminator"" film.      <br/><br/>I should tell you all that there is definitely going to be a ""Terminator 4"". Do not let the films title ""Rise of the Machines"" mislead you in any way, since by films end, the machines have risen and the war has started.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is good as always, as is Nick Stahl (filling in for Edward Furlong) as John Conner.  Claire Danes, who I have never really paid much attention to (other than ""Romeo & Juliet"" in 1996), is also pretty convincing too.  Of course, the real light here is Kristanna Loken as the T-X, who is even better than Robert Patrick's T-1000. <br/><br/>

","OKay... I wasn't expecting Days of Heaven.  <br/><br/>Terminator 3 is hollow and overblown and did not interest me from the opening shot.  Too many characters and elements were missing from the story for this installment to be interesting.  The script was contrived, weak and all over the place.  There was nothing ground breaking about the film; although the action was consistent.  The film lacked atmosphere. The direction was a let down and a cover up.  At least, Cameron had a vision... Jonathan Mostow hardly has a clue.  There was no story just mayhem.  The story line was weak and uninspired... I can't believe it took five writers to come up with that script was an end product.  <br/><br/>ACTUAL DIALOGUE: ""There's my father's plane! I trained on it!"" <br/><br/>The plot was just a bunch of contrivances to paste and thread together action scenes.  I think more time should have been spent in the Animal Hospital -- the only original idea in the script.  Granted it's inexplicable... but I admire the bold choice in a movie that made NO OTHERS. EVEN the FX in T2 were better.           <br/><br/>The new characters were boring and uninspired.  John Conner was hardly inspiring as the savior of mankind.  The sending of a new Terminator should have been developed more.  Why is the new Terminator sexy?  I mean that's pointless.  Do something with the sex appeal.  The big problem is you can't take any of the Terminators seriously.  Ah-nuld is too funny and the other is way too sexy.  Robert Patric in T2 was vastly superior in so far as his performance.<br/><br/>The biggest let down was that Ah-nuld NEVER REALLY KICKED ANY ASS.  He just made corny jokes. There were funny jokes but funny jokes do not a good film make.  I wanted my money back.  Unfortunately, Henny Youngman won't be around to make the eventual Terminator 4 as he would make a great Terminator to duel with Der Ah-Nuld.             <br/><br/>As a whole, the film lacked so much that I saw no need to end it... it was phony from the start.  170 Million Dollar Opium for the mass-market masses (and the 1rst Terminator was a lo budget Cult Film and vastly superior).    <br/><br/>

"kgprophet","6","0","0","2 July 2003"," Mindless fun - but disrespects T1 & T2
","It seems that this film is the victim of trying to stuff as many 'what if this happens' into the script to the degree that it is no longer a movie, but a 'puff' piece trying get your attention in any way possible.  It's like all these reality shows trying to one-up each other (Who wants to Marry a Survivor Idol).  Many sequels have turned into disappointing rehashes. Alien 3 destroyed the feeling of having emotionally vanquished the big bad bugs by killing the girl and tossing Ripley back in the fire.  Godfather 3 should never be considered a legitimate successor to GF1 & 2.  When a sequel feels the need to outdo it's predecessor, it begins to lose credibility.  The most obvious problem is that, while the first film creates a successful 'formula', and the second film takes the formula and pushes the envelope, the third film can't do anything without feeling like a repeat. <br/><br/>
Indeed, T3 turns into a comedy, because everything it does as a different take on the formula is a joke.  This is too bad,  since you are dealing with a mass murdering cyborg, nuclear armegeddon,  and main characters fighting within inches of their lives.  One scene, the 'new' John Connor pleads for Arnie to help stop Skynet, Arnie replies with a dumb one liner that takes all the air out of what could have been a tense and gripping moment.  Same thing for any moment where we are supposed to take things seriously.  You can't,  so you don't feel the anxiety when lives are in danger. <br/><br/>
T2 had this tenseness,  you cared about their survival.  In T3, you already know the score.  When Arnie first runs into John,  he is scared and asks ""Are you going to kill me?"".  Of course not, we already know he is the good guy from T2.  And so on.  Just like Alien 3 & 4,  you feel you are in an alternative reality,  it has the same characters, same situations,  but it doesn't ring true.  <br/><br/>So we are only left with appreciating the stunts and special effects.  The action sequences are fun, thank God (shame on you, Hulk).  The pacing is very good (to the point that it deliberately leaves out some necessary mechanics of the story).  It clocks in less than 2 hours (something that other blockbuster movies should adhere to).  The third act propels the story very well, although the convenient daughter-of-a-Military-General-who-heads-a-secret-program arrangement reeks of cliche (hmmm...such as ""Hulk""?). <br/><br/>
I'll admit I had fun,  something some movies have forgotten about (Stars Wars 2).  I wish T3 could've taken itself more seriously.  But I agree with many other reviewers on this website that it has desecrated James Cameron's creation, (""No Fate But What We Make"" - guess not).  So I guess I like this film,  but it's no T2.  <br/><br/>I give it a 6 out of 10."

","Wow! This movie is an experience like no other. It was wonderful to dive into world of this story again and meet the Terminator as crazy as ever, John Connor and all the surrealistic but great elements of this science fiction. Car-chases get a whole new and deeper meaning and all Femme Fatale of history grow pale compared to this one. Cameron's elements of story-telling are kept alive and embraced. The humor was not far off either. So I must say, this is one of the best action movies in a long time. Compared to the first one, this one lacks the originality and surprise, but in other ways it is as good as both the predecessors, if not the best."
"janyeap","Null","0","0","2 July 2003"," So, it's about the Terminator hunk getting to match the hunks of machines...
","Well, Arnold does prove he's still in shape   at least to take the strip! Cyborg T-800 is back to deliver the stunts this brawny hunk can best put on screen: pound, lift, throw and clash against objects with loud, heavy bangs! But how does his stature compare against other hunk machines  to capture the loudest thuds and bangs? One can expect this flick to be a noisy, busy film that leaves the environment with wastes and debris.<br/><br/>All this film offers are the non-stop sequences of intense chases, clashes, blasts and fuming blazes, cut in such fast paces to disallow room for emotional suspense. Admittedly, this film does have the most creative designs of vehicles and machines and captures the best effects when everything, including metallic heads, bang against each other. Doesn't that surge up memories of kids ferociously bashing up their Dinky toys to see what they can wreck and how much noise they can produce? Hey, whatever happened to the concept about humans destined to face Judgement Day because of the rise of evil machines? Or is this just about one John Connor who has to keep running for his life? The character development in this film is lame  it doesn't offer me reason to believe Connor's survival is relevant to the human race. I guess this film is telling us that humans are mostly in rehab!<br/><br/>This sequel is over-streamlined with references to its two predecessors - with only a few new turns. The dialogue is simple  always giving prompt to predictable actions that follow. Arnold, in his guttural voice, gushes out many one-liners. Perhaps, the poor cyborg would be mumbling and jumbling up his speech, if he's given the opportunity to voice a mouthy bit. <br/><br/>
Nick Stahl may be cute as the young adult, Connor. But he can't match the cool Colin Farrell to mesmerize me. Clair Dane's Kate Brewster looks like a young version of Laura Bush.  Kristana Loken - more superior, new TX killing machine  but T-1000 has more memorable and interestingly complex characteristics. Not that it matters that Loken's TX has a pretty face?  She swings in to various forms, morph, dissipate, and turn into metallic energy. When she takes the human form, she walks like a robot and keeps her face emotionless. Boy, she's harder to kill than Willard's rat, Ben!<br/><br/>
Evil Terminator comes to kill John Connor, and good old Terminator Arnold swings into the scenes to protect him. Changing the terminator into a girl ain't enough to keep the story captivating. With a budget past $180 million, I would have expected to see more realistic bodies hitting clashing against the various objects. Instead, those, flung in mid-air, seem more like rubbery dummies dangling in space before their images disappear from view. Jonathan Moslow's prop sets and special effects lack exuberance and wonder as a result of the overwelming repititions of clash and bangs. Just a chaotic mess of over-the-top crashes and explosions that gives little room for me to gasp with suspense and emotions for their characters!   <br/><br/>
So, don't expect any hidden meanings, or expect the dialogue to arouse any exciting analysis discussions!  Don't expect to find any hidden agenda. Everything is what exactly flashes out on the screen. Not surprising, Arnold's voice booms out more easy-to-remember one-liners in this film. The special effects are not as dreamlike as those effects in Matrix 2. They are bold and fast-paced - there's not a moment spared for anyone to detect flaws! Yep, they work well for an action flick, allowing the viewers to be mesmerized with loads of chases and explosions. The story is pretty staid. For a dark subject like Judgement Day, I'd actually expected this sequel to carry deeper surreal themes. Arnold's character may be given more human emotions, the characters, but over all, all the characters lack interesting traits. It's definitely a film that's simply made busy with action sequences to keep me engaged. OK, I did have a hell of a good time watching the explosive stunts!       <br/><br/>And so, about Skynet's attempt to fulfill the apocalyptic prediction... whoa I guess Arnold will hope to get us to see T4... unless he should be trapped with duty in his attempt to save California!  <br/><br/>Watching this movie makes me realize how artically awesome the GCI aspects of Hulk is! <br/><br/>D"

","First of all you should see this film before reading any reviews, not because I'm going to give you any spoilers but simply because this is a very enjoyable movie and worth seeing before discussing. <br/><br/>This is a film that loves being a sequel and there are not many third outings that come anywhere close to the first two movies usually. In many respects T3 is more similar in tone to Alien 3 than any other sequel, in that you get the impression that Mostow has gone out of his way to not only include the jaw dropping action of T2: Judgment Day, but also the pure Tech-Noir quality of the 1984 original and although he can't top either of these classics he gets a pretty good combination effect. With a new Terminator we get new plays on favorite jokes (don't you remember Hasta la Vista?'), new twists on familiar routines (such as the naked Arnie appearing in time for ladies night) coupled with a sense of dread and uncertainty that fits with the current fears of an unstoppable military power. Nick Stahl (as John Conner) who looks like he wondered out of Detour' (US/1945) is a deadbeat on a motorbike eking an existence on the road from town to town, he feels that the apocalyptic future he was destined to be part of has been avoided, but has left him without a purpose. Then Arnie shows up and informs him that Judgment Day is round the corner. Can he stop it this time? Is he still the savior? With Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) as (surely more than love interest!) an initially unwilling accomplice, they try to avert the coming Armageddon and outrun the T-X (Kristanna Loken) an upgraded liquid metal Terminator in NEW ultra deadly Scandinavian female form! As many other critics have pointed out there is a lot more humor in this film and Mostow may not have the masterstroke quality of James Cameron BUT he knows what this franchise is all about:       1.   Trading in on Arnies' one-dimensional UberMensch acting style for all it's worth. He still looks fantastic and you can really revel in his juggernaut bravado.       2.   Countering his nonhuman persona with the more human characters through humor (of which there is plenty) but more importantly independent thinking (limited as that is for Arnie) 3.	The look, the style and the feel of a leather jacket (as epitomized by the choice of clothing of both Terminators) and cool dark shades.<br/><br/> There are a few misfires from this Uzi of a movie however but nothing that misses the central body mass. The main one being is why Claire Danes in this film? You can see that she's really struggling to get something more out of her character from every tragedy that hits her, but she just gets swept away by the next spectacular set piece. The music is dull but unobtrusive so loss there and some of the deeply meaningful dialogue moments feel like they were lifted from a daytime soap. Arnie gets in some good one liners, some of them on target but quite a few off center and that's something you feel Cameron would have left on the cutting room floor) All in all though this is the exemplary expensive summer movie you would expect with a lot of thrills and a lot of laughs. Mostow however has a put a devil of a knot in the tail of this movie and he may not be James Cameron but he deserves more credit for pulling it off with an elegiac grace.<br/><br/>(Vote: 8/10)"

"Mr Parker","Null","0","0","2 July 2003"," This movie sucked!!! I mean it really sucked!!!
","Good. Now that I've gotten your attention, I'd like to say a few things about the movie, which I had the pleasure of watching last night.<br/><br/>
I LOVED IT! Let me get some minor quibbles out first.<br/><br/>It's immediately apparent while you're watching the movie that Cameron's touch is missing. There's something about watching a Cameron movie that never lets you forget who it is that's directing it. I think the one detail that makes it the most obvious in this flick is the acting. I've heard that Cameron is a real stickler for getting a performance out of someone in the exact way that he wants it and say what you want about the first two Terminator movies but the acting was excellent across the board on the both of them, save for the corny emotional moments that popped up from time to time in the second one. I kind of felt like the acting in this installment was not really focused upon. Don't get me wrong, it's actually pretty good, especially Nick Stahl as a worn down John Connor. Overall though, it sometimes felt like I was watching an original Sci-Fi channel movie on occasion. Other gripes I had with the flick were the occasional ""funny"" moment that was anything but. There were a couple of holes that left me shaking my head (case in point, when John and Kate (Claire Danes) go to see her father at Skynet, I would've thought that getting into a military installation with loads of weapons would've proven more difficult than just walking in but again, it's forgivable). The T-X made for a good villain but hats off to Robert Patrick's T-1000. Aside from Arnold's original Terminator, he made for the most menacing Terminator yet. I will give Ms. Loken her props, she was convincingly ruthless when executing her victims.<br/><br/>Enough with the gripes. Let me tell you what makes this movie fantastic. Let's just get it out of the way right now and say that the action in this movie is jaw-dropping. The future scenes were awesomely realized. That chase you've seen in the trailers with the crane truck and Arnold swinging off of it? THAT ONE SCENE DESTROYS THE MUCH HERALDED CHASE SCENE IN MATRIX RELOADED. And that's just one of the scenes. There is a lesson to be learned here, filmmakers. The less CG effects you use, the more realistic everything becomes. Remember that truck chase in the canal in T2? Exactly. While the Matrix did show off some nifty little effects, the sense of danger achieved in the T3 chase is much greater because of one simple thing. Most of it was done for real with real, bonafide stuntwork. The CG that was used in the sequence isn't painfully obvious when you look at it and like other CG heavy action movies, doesn't take you out of the realism. And isn't heightening the sense of fear and danger for our heroes the main goal here? As of late, I think too many movies are depending on CG these days to sell them and I give this movie a big thumbs up just for keeping the CG use down to practical levels. This movie is loaded with action and unlike T2, it never drags. T2 is an amazing film accomplishment but you've gotta admit that the middle of the movie is a bit too slow. Not here. There's enough action here to keep anyone satisfied but thankfully it doesn't go into the ""too much action"" territory that films like ""The Mummy Returns"" have ventured into, only to come out with headache inducing results. <br/><br/>The movie clocks in at just under two hours, a perfect length for the story presented. As for the story, you'll walk out of the theater realizing that this movie was done with a great amount of respect for it's predecessors. I don't want to give away any details but trust me when I say that this film fits in perfectly with the other two. There's a sense of despair and dread that grows and grows until ultimately, you realize the scope of what's being played out before you. I loved it and I'm really happy with the way the story turned out. I liked all of those little ideas and nuances that pop up and make you smile in wonder. It may not be as ""smart"" as the second was but it still holds it's own.<br/><br/>I never got the sense that this movie was made strictly for monetary purposes and that in itself makes this film an above average sequel. How many sequels are actually above average, let alone a second sequel? I love the fact that director Johnathan Mostow pulled through with this. I, like many others, was very skeptical about whether or not he could pull it off and believe me, he does. Cameron might've been able to deliver a tighter film but this movie doesn't ruin the memory of the first two for me, so I'm not going to complain. <br/><br/>I don't know if I've covered enough in this review but I'll just finish by saying that Arnold does not disappoint with what has become over the years, his signature role. He plays the role so comfortably that it's hard to believe that it's been over ten years since we last saw him. One-liners aside, it's good to have you back, Mr. S. <br/><br/>Rating: **** out of *****."
"bdotson","3","0","0","1 July 2003"," It's just a movie
","Uhgg. Where do I start? I watched T3 last night. Now, I'm a HUGE fan of the first two. They are amazing films that still hold up after multiple viewings. In, fact, last weekend I watched The Terminator and T2 in preparation for my viewing of T3. Perhaps director Jonathan Mostow should have watched them before he began filming, because he apparantly has never seen them.<br/><br/>I absolutely refuse to acknowledge T3 as part of the storyline. T3 is bad. I mean, Highlander 2 bad. Not only was the storyline bad, but so was the filmmaking. This mess was just a bunch of action scenes very loosely strung together by a thin story. What made the first two movies so good? The Action? No. The Effects? No. Certainly the action and effects did give those films another level of enjoyment, but what made them good was the story. T3 seems to think if you have action and special effects, you don't need a story. Well, without a story, you have garbage.<br/><br/>SPOILERS WITHIN T3 is full of unexplained scenes. In fact, some scenes actually jump to different geographical locations without ever explaining how the characters got there. (For example- John, Kate, The Terminator and The TX all show up in a high security military installation without ever explaining how they got there.) The characters seem to randomly show up whenever it's time to have an action scene. Hey, who needs a plot. We've got stuff to blow up!<br/><br/>There are severe inconsistencies from the other two films. Taking what we know, the first Terminator takes place in 1984. John Conner's voice over dialogue at the beginning of T3 specifically states that he was 13 during the events of T2. Now, assuming John was born in '84, or '85, that would place T2 in the year 1997, obviously before August, because, as we know, that's when Judgement Day is. In T3, Sarah Conner's gravesite places her year of death in 1997. John explains that she died from leukiemia, exactly three years after she was diagnosed. Since she was diagnosed after the events of T2, well, then, her death should have been around the year 2000. Apparantly, the writers can't count.<br/><br/>The Terminator from T3 has specific traits that the Terminator from T2 developed (example-finding car keys in the visor) how is that possible if he's a different terminator?<br/><br/>T1 and T2 both follow a very specific time travel philosphy. T3 completely ignores the rules of time travel that were layed out in the first two films. T3 complety screws up the time line.<br/><br/>The music flat out sucks. The music in the first two films were very important components. Brad Fiedel's music is absent from T3, and the music they did use is awful.<br/><br/>T3 just doesn't fit. It's not consistant with the other two. The look is different, the music is different, and the story is different. It just doesn't belong.<br/><br/>I know what you're saying. ""It's just a movie"". You're right. T3 is ""just"" a movie- and that's exactly what's wrong with it. T1 and T2 weren't just movies. They were something more. And if you're going to continue something of that magnitude, you'd better do a good job. Jonathan Mostow has failed. All he succeeded in doing is making another shallow Hollywood action movie. Jonathan Mostow, you should be ashamed of yourself.<br/><br/>(James Cameron, if you're reading this, you have my permission to kick him right in the shins. Your creation has been disrespected and ruined, and I am sad.)<br/><br/>My advice, skip this movie altogether and watch the first two again."

","T3 is a solid final installment (or so we think) of the Terminator series. The plot pretty much works, the action is consistent throughout the movie and the ending was actually pretty good as well.<br/><br/>The acting was generally weak. Casting for this film, outside of the 2 Terminators, was not done well. However, Arnold somewhat makes up for the weak acting by providing some rather comical one-liners throughout the movie that bring a smile to your face. Kristanna Loken also does a great job as the 2nd Terminator. She was every bit as good as Robert Patrick in T2, and he was a hard act to follow.<br/><br/>Overall, T2 was the best of the 3 movies, not T3. There is nothing ground breaking in T3.

There shouldn't be humor like that. That's just wrong. They should have at least up graded his power and computer level. I felt like he was an old Dos machine the whole time watching it.

He never really has kicked ass if you think about it, what the hell man! I'm thoroughly in a state of disappointment. Why did they have to make so many new things, like making him a whole other different terminator? It looses its sentimental value you lived up for watching. I disagree with so many things in this movie. It literally had no potential. I can't help but feel sad with all this. James Cameron should have done it. It is his work, not someone who's done a dumb comedy back in 89, some action movie with Kurt Russell in 97, some TV. Movie, and a very repetitive submarine movie. Why?? I just don't get all this.

It seemed like a movie for the sake of an action movie. Total rehash. It goes to show the total lack of planing for sequels. I would say this should have been called Judgement Day, not T2.

There's not much character development, there's no real message, and it doesn't really feel as much as an event as the previous two.

But the truth is that Terminator 2 was basically a retread of the first Terminator, right down to its ""here's another truck over-turning"" third act.  What Terminator 2 had going for it was the raw power and surprise of a pumped up Linda Hamilton; plus the new CGI morphing effects that brought the T-1000 to life; and the fresh twist that Arnold was now the ""good guy.""  Still, at the end of the second film, we basically were back where we started, with the nuclear armaggedon again supposedly stopped.  It lacked real scope.  Terminator 3 finally takes us somewhere new in its final minutes, and this is what really elevates an okay action retread a bit higher making it a worthy sequel--especially if it means we finally get to the good stuff in the fourth film.  Mostow is a bit of a journeyman, without much grace or artistry.  The female T-X makes less of an impression than one would've hoped.

In fact it would be hard pressed for anyone to have made a better sequel! <br/><br/>Film starts about ten years after events of T2 with an adult John Connor (well played by Nick Stahl) who by fate intersects with former schoolmate Kate Brewster (Claire Danes also quite good). Enter the Terminatrix who is a bad ass female top-of-the-line cyborg who can do the liquid metal thing and ALSO control other machines. In fact, the whole premise of the movie's title is faithfully developed as the dreaded Skynet (alluded to in the first films) begins to take shape as a new defense net with some bugs to work out. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the original Terminator sent back in time to rescue Connor AND Brewster! The plot thickens a bit to a surprising conclusion that is open for, dare I say-T4?<br/><br/>Special effects are outstanding. The $170 million budget is all up there. And there are some cute references to the previous films with Arnold getting the best lines and retorts.  He looks great and does what amounts to a comeback film.  The pace of the film is steady and interesting. In fact,unless you were a hardcore fan, the average moviegoer might not detect that almost none of the principals of the first two films signed for this one. <br/><br/>OK, James Cameron set the bar very high especially with T2, but you have to give credit to a fine effort here.

","I was able to see a preview of T3 and was excited for a lot of questions to get answered, but I didn't get much for all my enthusiasm. Arnold is plastic this time around and not very machine-like at all. The female terminator is a nice change of pace, but she is just that: a woman instead of a man to kill John Conner. Only Nick Stahl was any good in this movie. And he tries to create that same sense of fear and danger that was apparent in the first two terminator movies, but for all his effort it isn't there.<br/><br/>
If you are looking to watch something close to a James Cameron movie you may be very disappointed. But if you are looking for computer generated effects, not as much action as the previous two movies, and not have anything really answered from the second movie, then this may not be worth watching.

","Well...coming into the theater I was not very optimistic. I'm a huge fan of the Terminator films, especially the 2nd installment. When I saw the trailer with Arnold saying ""She'll be back"", I thought for sure this was going to be one hell of a bad flick. <br/><br/>I actually really liked the film. Although Cameron didn't direct it and Edward Furlong didn't reprise his role as John Connor, I enjoyed the whole movie. Nick Stahl gave a good performance, and Claire Danes was also pretty good. It's hard to complement the performance of two actors who don't even have facial expression...well, I guess it must've been hard actually to make all those action sequences without showing any feelings, so I'll give them that. Kristanna Loken is very sexy as the TX, but also very deadly, I really liked her character. <br/><br/>Sure, there were some dumb punchlines, such as the much anticipated ""She'll be back"", but although this movie is a serious action movie, there were some amusing scenes which didn't fail to make people laugh, just like in Terminator 2. <br/><br/>I was only disappointed that Sarah Connor's philosophy (The future is not written. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves) is proven untrue in this movie. I believe strongly in this philosophy and I find it deceiving to see they're ruining it in this film. Sorta like a christian who watches the movie Dogma...hehe. <br/><br/>Overall this is a really good movie, for every Terminator fan, for every action fan, sci-fi fan, etc...If you want to see an action packed summer movie, TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES is the one you should definitely go watch."

","I really loved Terminator, but  Terminator 2 was kind of a disappointment. Moments full of action, sometimes very slow (and almost boring) and no story at all. <br/><br/>However, for  Rise of the Machines,  Mr. Mostow, the same who was able to do something with acceptable with Jurassic Park III (another extinct franchise), came to the rescue and got something sometimes better, sometimes (particularly by the end) darker and overall funnier than both predecessors.<br/><br/>
Two Terminators come back to the past to defend/destroy the future resistance. The obsolete but still useful T-1 (Arnold better than ever) and the new model (Kristanna Loken) whose more interesting advantage is her ability to control other machines.  The future has changed, but judgment day is still unavoidable, and the importance of the players has somewhat shifted. John Connor is one of the targets, but there are others as important as him.  Also, this time the story has a couple of un-exploited but interesting twists and the darkest ending of the series. <br/><br/>
Arnold character, has a lot more development than the previous films.  He owns almost all the jokes and together with Claire Danes completely controls the screen.  Nick Stahl is sadly not on the same level. While Edward Furlong (on the same character in T-2) looked like a future leader, Nick looks like a future looser, not near the fighter he is supposed to become.<br/><br/>The action, this time deserves special mention. The first car chase is worth the price of the ticket.  MATRIX looks pale in comparison and the special effects does not look `digital' at all. This seems to be real cars and buildings destroyed. If really it was a trick I am buying it.<br/><br/>My only complain (aside from Stahls character) is the restrain of some scenes.  It looks that they really targeted the PG-13 (the movie is rated R), and failed, but the feeling is that they could have go further but they didn't.<br/><br/>This is a 4.5 stars over 5; I hope they keep the same quality on Terminator 4."

","Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as the cybernetic half-human half-machine terminator in this sequel to the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This film begins just like its predecessors, two terminators are sent back through time. One is sent to protect members of the human resistance (Schwarzenegger), and another is sent by Skynet to terminate those who in the future lead the human's against the machines.<br/><br/>
     Those who saw the first two films may be wondering how Skynet survived considering it was supposedly destroyed, and the global nuclear attack known as Judgment Day prevented. According to this film, Judgment day was only put off by the actions of John and Sarah Conner ten years earlier. This knowledge leads to a predictable story as a now adult John Conner, now played by Nick Stahl, must once again try to stop Skynet from being created while on the run from a more advanced terminator, the `TX' played by Kristanna Loken. Sarah Conner who was played by Linda Hamilton was not in this film, and the writers attempted to fill this void by adding Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), one of John's future Lieutenants and love interests. <br/><br/>     The movie did very well in one area: special effects. The chase scenes between Conner and the TX nearly matched the level of intensity present in the second Terminator film. Unfortunately, the hole left by Hamilton, and Edward Furlong (John Conner in T2) was not filled by any of the new talent in this feature.  It led to a lack of believable emotion, and for me indifference towards the characters fate.  <br/><br/>     T2: Judgment Day was well acted, well written, and it contained special effects that were ahead of its time. Much of the credit for that goes to writer and director James Cameron. His absence from the third film hurt it deeply...what could have been another epic blockbuster unfortunately is just another average sci-fi action flick."

","Terminator 3 has several strengths.  I think the actor playing John Connor is very good.  Claire Danes is very good as the woman caught up in the mayhem.  The movie also has very good action scenes.  Best of all, it comes in at about two hours, which comes as a welcome relief for those who thought movies like ""Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Hulk"" would never end.  Therefore, I recommend this movie.  However, the movie is not as good as the first two movies, which are classics.  As good as the actor playing John Connor is, he is not as good as Eddie Furlong in the same role in ""Terminator 2.""  I also really missed Linda Hamilton who anchored the first two movies.  The new villain in T3 is not nearly as menancing as the T-1000 in ""Terminator 2"" probably because Robert Patrick is a better actor than the one they have in T3.  Finally, I was not crazy about the ending.  I will give nothing away, but it is a real disappointment.  I honestly don't know how audiences will respond to this ending.

","Jonathan Mostow's (`U-571') `Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' effectively predicts the near-decimation of the human race by machines through their invincible weapon, computer software.<br/><br/>The hope is that John Connor (Nick Stahl, `In the Bedroom') and his lieutenant, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes, `The Hours'), can repopulate the resistance with the survival help of Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-1000 robot, which is truly `back' from 2029 by way of a time machine.<br/><br/>The new T-X killing machine is a superior female whom Arnie describes as faster and more intelligent than he, a moment of truth I found endearing and a tribute to the overall sophistication of the film, which also has Arnold reprising many of his famous one-liners with tongue firmly in cheek and about as dry as the Mojave Desert.<br/><br/>It's that female robot that so intrigues me: Athletic-looking  Kristanna Loken inhabits the role like Naomi Watts on steroids, a blonde who can morph in a second, sometimes into an even more voluptuous lady to avoid a speeding ticket. She throws Arnie around like a stuffed animal, he looking pectorally perfect in advancing middle age, but more than this she figuratively establishes the evolution of women as superior to men in the future.<br/><br/>Because of the egregious number of explosions and weapons in general, `T-3' misses the opportunity to build further on Arnie's wit, the theme of computer enslavement, and the emergence of women as an invincible productive and destructive force. It doesn't come close enough to George Meredith's observation that the ""God of this world is in the machine, not out of it.'<br/><br/>`T3' does outpace, however, the narrow genetics of `Hulk,' the impersonality of `Xmen,' and the inscrutable plot of `The Matrix.'  It also wins the race for the best race of the year, in which a giant crane on a truck levels a building while jousting with a fire truck.<br/><br/>I wanted more thought in this film and less action.  After all, I am inextricably welded to the challenges my computer offers me everyday, hoping someone will tame the ever-expanding gigabytic tyrant. Alas, it's not T3 who will save me but maybe my 800 Gateway number. However, the film is much more fun than a morning making that call."

","I'm a huge fan of ""The Terminator"" franchise.  I saw the first one when I was 10 years old and it blew me away to say the least.  I was stoked to see T2 and it exceeded my greatest expectations.  When I heard that they were finally making a third film, I was thrilled.  However, I became concerned when all the problems with the film began even before the production started.  Jim Cameron not being involved made me very apprehensive about the integrity of the story and its themes about humanity and technology.  I didn't want T3 to be just a shoot-em-up action pic which the summer usually carries.  I had read Arnold saying that he wouldn't be involved in the film unless Jim Cameron was involved but when he signed without him I figured that it was either a really good script which did the first two films justice or the $30 million paycheck (I hoped it was not just the second but Arnold doesn't really need the money so the script must be descent).  The female Terminator seems a little contrived to me (through the process of elimination, it's the next antagonist that brings a new twist to the series, since the first two villians were males and Schwarzenegger had to be the hero again).  Kristanna Loken sure looked the part: tall, seductive with killer eyes and a menacing presence.  But, can the audience buy a woman ""out-manning"" Arnold.  I was pleased that they decided not to cast Eddie Furlong as John Connor.  Nick Shahl is a good actor with a couple good credits on his resume (In The Bedroom, Disturbing Behavior).  Jonathan Mostow was a strange choice I thought as director, given he only has a couple credits to his name, both with only moderate success (Breakdown, U-571).  Although, without Jim Cameron, the director is no longer a sell point anyway because no one can match his venerable appeal to sci-fi fans.  Warner Bros. just needed someone who was passionate about the project and didn't want to run it into the ground.  If Mostow took the job, he must truly believe he can pull it off. With all these pros and cons on my mind, I was very curious, nervous and excited going into this movie.  I saw the film at a private screen for the Tonight Show staff on the WB lot last Monday (June 26).  IT BLEW ME AWAY. It delivers on most fronts.  The action is intense.  It has a lot of physical stunt work which I believe to be more amazing then CGI stunts (like The Matrix films) because it comes with greater realism and bigger stakes. The special effects do not disappoint.  The T-X is very cool.  She can manipulate any machine and use them to work under her control.  She can shape-shift like the T-1000 in ""T2"" (but she is still a metallic unit under her organic guise).  She can manufacture weapons with her arms (flame-thrower, rocket-launcher).  And she isn't too hard to look at either. She was sent back through time to take out John Connor's mission partners from the future since John Connor cannot be located (he's living off the grid leaving no physical evidence of his existence whenever he goes). He's totally paranoid about this future and dreads what he knows about it.  The T-X happens upon John while attempting to terminate his future wife and parnter-in-arms (well played by Claire Daines).  But the T-800 was sent back to protect John again and he gets to John first (but barely).  The first meeting of the two Terminators culminates in a spectular car chase with a gigantic crane truck through the streets of downtown LA.  It's one of the many fantastic action pieces in the film.   The movie is basically a cat-and-mouse game between the T-800 and company and the T-X (similar story to the first two films).  This film still has the plot line about Skynet and its imminent self-awareness which actually is set to happen on the same day the film take places.  This adds great tension and suspense to the story since time becomes such a critical factor for John.  Can he once again prevent the rise of the machines and circumvent his destiny?  According to the T-800, Judgment Day has just postponed by the events which took place in ""T2"", not prevented.  John doesn't want to be the leader of the human resistance again the machines and chooses once again to stop Skynet while still trying to evade the T-X who is hot on his trail (again, another great tension-builder).  Before I continue, I need to mention one point which still bothers me a bit about the entire story behind ""T3"".  If at the end of ""T2"", all evidence of the existence of the Terminator was destroyed in the boiling steel and Cyberdine Labs was completely eradicated, how did the T-800 and other models of Terminator get invented this time around.  At the end of ""T1"" there was the wreakage of the T-800 in the hyraudlic press which inspired the creation of the hardware.  But, all that is destroyed in ""T2"". I'm willing to forget about that hole in the story since the film was so good and worth making, but it's worth mentioning anyway.  ""T3"" does lack the strong bond formed between the Terminator and John which is something that made ""T2"" surprising dramatic at times and made its ending more tragic and memorable.  But even though ""T3"" doesn't work on all the same levels of ""T2"", the film focuses much harder on the levels it takes on and makes you forget about its lack of drama.  The film has an ending I did not expect and I believe that it was the best way to end the film.  I won't spoil it for you but you won't see it coming.  I really hope that people will go see this film because it deserve to do well at the box-office.  I don't think the advertising does the film justice and may deter a lot of people from seeing it (it looks a lot like a typical summer blockbuster instead of a good film).  I wish they ran a few  trailer which toned down the stunt work and special effects and dealt more with the story and the themes so people can see that it actually has them.  Good word of mouth is what is going to fill the seats in the theater.  It will open well, I think ($75 million over the 5 day week) but it's staying power will rely on both good reviews and repeat business.  I am going to see it again this weekend and urge everyone who liked the first two not to miss the third installment.  It will not disappoint, I promise."

Maybe because it's set in the real world, I don't know. When I had the opportunity to see a preview of Terminator 3, I thought I was bound to be disappointed, not least because the director Jonathan Mostow made the appalling U571. But I was enthralled. From start to finish, I couldn't tear my eyes from the screen for one moment. Much of the film is similar to the first two, in that there's an evil Terminator after the good guy with someone from the future to protect them. Cue high adrenalin car chases, stunts, explosions, etc., all done with panache and good humour. But there's more to this movie than its predecessors, more than just simple chasing. There's a bigger picture, about fate, about the<br/><br/>relentless march of technology and the naivety of the American military.<br/><br/>Quite simply, it's an interesting film. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are believable and have good chemistry, Arnie is entertaining, with some great one-liners and the female Terminatrix blends in without any problem.

This is the worst kind of sequel, in that it kinda poisons the memory of the films that came before it a little bit, negating the perfection they left in their complimentary tales. <br/><br/>But there's more bad than that. Nick Stahl registers zero as John Conner, and Claire Danes is miscast in a thankless role to begin with. Arnold is back in the groove, but it's schtick by this point because the script feels so desperate and forced as it tries to take the franchise in a new direction. The ending is just sour and rotten and corruptive of the mythology that was nicely tied up by the films before it. <br/><br/>T3: No fun, no smarts, no good. This is Hollywood at its worst: Milking a franchise that should've logically stopped at sequel in order to generate a few more hundred millions."

","Terminator, the original was a great movie. It was dark and atmospheric. The acting was excellent. I felt Michael Biehn(sp) and Linda Hamilton's characters had chemistry together, the story was good and the action was amazing.<br/><br/>Terminator 2 however, blew me away! How the characters had grown! The future still dark... The action sequences were even better! I waited, and waited so hopefully for the sequel... then finally I saw it, and it had nothing in common with the first two serious films other than the vague following of the plot. The whole film was a joke, and if it had been marketed as a farce or comedy I may have liked it, but it was presented as a serious sequel somehow! The female terminator was hilarious, not menacing... the original terminator looked ready for a rest home, The guy who took over Furlongs part was also very amusing with the dumbo ears and white hair when they show him in the future and the girl was a waste of film altogether... she screamed well, I guess...I'd have to give her that...<br/><br/>It was noted on Linda Hamilton's website that she refused a small part they offered her in the beginning because she said the film had no heart or soul or something like that, and she was right. The first two did and are classics, the third, well, it should never have been made, but the greed and the lack of talent are great in this world..."

","Wasn't the entire point of Terminator 2 that 'there is no fate but what we make for ourselves'? It was a good message, as humans have always had the tendency to deal with their anxieties by attributing inevitability or some sort of cosmic plan to future events. While this may be true, I find it most prudent to subscribe to the view that the future is not set and that it is in our hands. It allows you to live your life to the fullest and to die knowing you spent your life trying to make a difference.<br/><br/>I loved the ending of T2. The sacrifices made by the protagonists have proved that future CAN be changed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when a sequel promises a safe way to earn lots of money, it does become inevitable.<br/><br/>So what is the message this time around? That future is inevitable anyhow, and no matter what you do the universe has conspired to entrap you and make you a helpless pawn in a grand scheme where life, death, even love are pre-determined. This is a rejection of everything the previous two (excellent) films have stood for.<br/><br/>Having rejected the essence of the previous films, T3 goes on to reference more marginal elements from them, because that's what the audience wants, right? Give us Arnold as the Terminator, give us those beloved references. Let us re-live some of that past awesomeness! But it's a pale copy. The film does not feel genuine in any way, and it is less competently written and directed than the previous installments. The antagonist is a useless bimbo that is in no way menacing, and the protagonists are made to say stupid lines and either sit in the back of a van or run around aimlessly.<br/><br/>So what is good about this film? Well, Arnold, of course. He is the reason we are watching this. The rest is just nonsense we have to endure so we can see Arnie do his stuff. And he delivers, although he can't do anything to fix a poorly written script.<br/><br/>Going back to the script, now we learn that Connor's wife is suddenly a major player in the resistance, which was never even hinted at in the previous films. Moreover, their children too are important. You can just tell they are making up stuff just so they can squeeze in new characters and make it possible to extend this franchise forever. And the original myth about John Connor? Who cares. If we think we can make another sequel by inventing Connor's relatives, ex-wives, cousins, children, grandchildren, math teacher, pet dog, etc. we will shove these characters into the plot.<br/><br/>As we have seen, T4 further distanced itself from the original film and now anything goes. As long as there is a robot that looks like a human skeleton in it, you can call it a 'terminator' movie and start making money.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that T2 was the end of this story. It was nicely wrapped up by the creator of the original film and there was no need for a sequel, or a prequel, or a reboot. It's time for filmmakers and studios to start creating original stories and characters and stop cynically exploiting the original work done by true filmmakers decades ago. We need to start voting with our feet and avoid movie theaters in protest. Get yourself a blu-ray of the original film and watch it at home with your friends or family."
"kuarinofu","5","2","5","18 February 2020"," The beginning of the end
","Re-watching this film in 2020 after all the sequels and re-quels makes so much more sense since it gives you a clear picture of when and where it all started. I'm talking about the parasitism of the Terminator franchise.<br/><br/>Obviously, every film after the first one is the same exact film, yet if Terminator 2 was a superior big-budget refined version of the first one, every other film after it was just a lesser version of T2 (except for Salvation, which was a slightly different take but still bad).<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, when I watched Genisys in the theatre I thought that this idea of re-shooting the classic ones frame-by-frame is just a sign of creative bankruptcy that the franchise has come to.<br/><br/>Then Dark Fate came out, and it was exactly the same film as T2 scene-by-scene with different backdrops and CGI. There was little to no original content in that. I have a detailed review of the Dark Fate as well.<br/><br/>And now, after re-watching Rise of the Machines, the picture is finally clear in my mind. The franchise was never supposed to live past T2, the story was over, and this film shows it.<br/><br/>Rise of the Machines is a cheesy badly written rehash of T2 with horrible CGI that was never good and doesn't hold up in 2020.<br/><br/>There are some redeeming factors like the insane car chase with actual physical stunts which looks great even in 2020, and the ending was surprisingly good for a horribly written story like this.<br/><br/>And of course, Arnie was great to look at, even though his character is a comically large dumb robot, which is what our beloved Terminator has become after this film in all the sequels that feature real Arnie, both Genisys, and Dark Fate made him a joke as well.<br/><br/>There should have never been a T2 sequel. We stopped Judgement Day but found ourselves in a Garbage Day."

","Considering what happens at the end of 'T2', everything that happens in Terminator 3 is impossible (don't even get me started). This fact alone should be a good enough reason why not to make this movie and rob the other two films of their dignity. Terminator 3 does practically everything wrong, but the worst thing it does is leave the story open for Terminator 4 (or what we now know as Terminator Salvation)<br/><br/>The best way to summarize Terminator 3 is to say that this movie shows us how the war between man and machine begins, and how John Conner becomes the one who is destined to save mankind. This may sound like an exciting premise, but it results in a movie that does not belong anywhere near Jim Cameron's genius creations. <br/><br/>The script is rubbish. It literally steals plot points from Terminator and T2, and then attempts to make a better movie out of them by adding more mindless action and special effects, neither of which is remotely useful to the story. Instead of being thrilling and epic, the action sequences are confusing and rather dull. The acting is terrible, and the characterization is even worse. The protagonists do virtually nothing but fight, and fight, and fight, and try to survive. It all happens so fast with no character interaction, no suspense, no adventure, and no emotion. Terminator 3 isn't worth your time."
"Anonymous_Maxine","Null","2","5","6 November 2008"," Definitely inferior, but it's not THAT bad
","So yesterday I watched Under Siege 2 and today I watched Terminator 3 for the first time since I saw it in theaters when it was first released. I remember being hugely disappointed when I first saw it, but I noticed that I enjoyed it much more the second time around. It's better than I thought the first time I saw it, but it should be noted that there is no arguing with the fact that, even though it does a good job of furthering the Terminator story, director Jonathan Mostow is just not taking it very seriously. <br/><br/>That becomes clear almost immediately, as the Terminator walks into a bar during ladies night and has a run-in with a gay dancer, ultimately walking out of the bar clad in leather and putting on a purple pair of glittery star-shaped sunglasses. The entire movie became one of those rare theater experiences where everyone is laughing out loud and making jokes about the movie but nonetheless enjoying it, and no one seems to mind all the talking and giggling. <br/><br/>It's immediately clear that Arnold is just not the same guy he was only ten years earlier. For some reason, he seems a lot more than ten years older here than he was in Judgement Day, and to make matters worse, his English seems to have slipped. His accent is much stronger now than it was before and it affects his performance. It's hard not to laugh out loud when he approaches Claire Dames and says, ""Catherine Broo-stuh?""<br/><br/>In the movie's defense, I loved the addition that it made to the Terminator story. We are given believable reasons for why there are still terminators even after the only chips were destroyed at the end of T2, and the ""rise of the machines"" is also well presented.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie is the casting. Claire Dames is good in her role of Catherine Brewster, a key element of the humans resistance against the machines, although she is just a little too recognizable. But Nick Stahl? Are you serious? From the very beginning of the movie, where he is shown as an older man in the future, Stahl is wildly miscast as John Connor. <br/><br/>Why didn't they just cast Eddie Furlong again? He's not the same guy he was back in 1992, but I can't imagine anyone else fitting the character as well. And surely he wasn't too busy, unless he was more interested in acting in the disappointing and instantly forgettable crime thriller ""3 Blind Mice"" than making another Terminator film. Such a thing hardly seems possible.<br/><br/>The other problem is that Kristannak Loken, who is undeniably beautiful, just doesn't understand the nature of her character, nor does director Jonathan Mostow. In the original film, Reese explained to Sarah Connor that the first Terminators had latex skin and were easy to spot, but the new ones had real organic tissue and looked exactly like normal humans.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, every time the Terminatrix is on screen, it's hard not to picture Mostow just off-camera saying, ""Do it again, and this time, try to act more like a machine!""<br/><br/>Wasn't the whole point of the newer and better Terminators to look and act more like humans and not like machines? At any rate, it just comes off as over-acting here. <br/><br/>But still, like the new Indiana Jones movie, the entertainment level is high, and there are certainly some good moments, like the Terminator telling John, ""Desire is irrelevant. I am a machine!""<br/><br/>I have a feeling that part 3 is going to be a low point in the series, which I'm not sure when it will end. I am thrilled to know that Christian Bale will take on the role of John Connor in Terminator: Salvation. It looks like the series is heading in exciting new directions"
"Danielramos16","5","2","5","22 June 2008"," Too many flaws
","I Love The Terminator films! they are truly unique & revolutionary, why? They were a perfect mix of Sci-Fi and action that had a dark & chilling tone to it. It was almost a warning to humanity about our over reliance on technology. Now we have this new chapter in the saga, Terminator 3. After leaving the theater I left feeling man that was awesome, but afterward I really started to think about the movie and how it compares to the first two films. For all it's great action & adventure it just isn't on the same level as The first two. Many fans will be upset cause it doesn't offer what we loved about the other films.<br/><br/>1.) It took too long to make Terminator 3: Arnold is the only actor who can be The Terminator, but now he's getting too old and can't be expected to continue being the terrifying cyborg much longer, not to mention he has become involved in politics so his dedication to making good Terminator films is gone. Also James Cameron wasn't back to direct, Big Problem! James Cameron was a man with vision, he knew exactly how to make The Terminator movies. I'm not sure why he didn't come back to do T3 but he hasn't done much directing in a while. Had T3 been made earlier not only do I think Cameron would have had the energy to direct, but he and Arnold could have come back with time do do a fourth. <br/><br/>2.) Bad tone: This film almost seems like a parody of the Terminator Films. It's far more comical and less serious in tone. Like I said before The Terminator films are darker, more grim, and have a clear morale message.<br/><br/>3.) Poor Casting: I hated Nick Stahl as John Conner! he came across as whinny, immature, cocky, and self-absorbed. I mean come on he's suppose to be the leader of the Human Resistance that saves humanity! grow up already! He seemed nothing like Edward Furlongs's John Conner in T2. Claire Danes seemed miscast, this isn't her kind of work and she too came off as whinny & immature. Kristanna Loken is Hot as hell, but she's no Terminator. Having a female as an evil Terminator just seems too awkward, she just wasn't intimidating like the original Terminator or the T-1000 (T2). It was wonderful to See Arnold as the Terminator, he was great as usual.<br/><br/>4.) Bad Dialogue: Too comical, and stupid. Couldn't take seriously.<br/><br/>5.) A crap Story Line: Too many plot holes. I mean the time line didn't add up, when compared to events of Terminator and Terminator 2. Ultimately the writers wrote a script and came up with a story that underachieved. The Terminator films tapped into societies deepest fears about Nuclear War & artificial Intelligence, the film makers were more concentrated in action, entertainment, and awesome special effects. It also failed to deliver what we really wanted out of T3. I wanted to see the chilling & terrifying recreation of Skynet in the aftermath of T2. Not to mention the other movies were kinda scary with the take over over the machines, T3 failed to capture the true horror and the terrifying possibility of a machine take over, I Robot was better doing that! <br/><br/>So what was so great about T3? well the action sequences were fantastic, better then that of the first Terminator but not as good as Terminator 2. Personally I'm glad that Judgement day happened, humanity just had to push it didn't they? After the event's of T2 when Skynet was destroyed it should have ended there, but mankind rebuilt skynet so there for humanity deserved to be pushed to extinction for it's ignorance & stupidity in redeveloping the computer that would destroy them. T3 did deal with our anxiety of future events, cause let's face it we are fearful of what the future holds for us. No matter how hard we try, we cannot avoid our destiny and that has been the one constant about the Terminator movies. And then of Course there's Arnold, without him this movie would have really sucked. T3 was missing many of the people & elements that made Terminator & Terminator 2 so legendary, but Arnold has always been the key piece of all three films. Terminator 3: Rise of the machines was a great action adventure film, it was fun & entertaining, but unfortunately it's just not on the same level as the other two.<br/><br/>Now with Terminator 4 coming out sometime in 2009, Arnold as I thought will not be reprising his role. I now fear the Terminator series will take a further nose dive."
"epatters-3","3","2","5","25 May 2008"," Terminator 3:Rise of the Crap.
","Crap. Just crap. Terrible dialogue. The first 2 were great but this is just a big piece of crap that is only fit for idiots that are fans of Battlefield Earth and people that think that every sequel is better then the previous installment. The Termanatrix sucks. The T-1000 is a better Terminator then that one. The TX is played by a frigging female. Terrible performances except for Arnold's. But that does not stop it from being the worst in the trilogy. Sarah Conner is dead. I think that Jonathon Mostow should be ashamed of himself for ruining(for give me) the series. If you have only seen the first 2 and you think you have seen it all then your right. You have. This one is so skipabble that I think that the movie thinks that the extreme dumbness of the movie is amusing. If you have not seen any of the Terminator movies then watch Part 1 and Part 2. Skip Part 3. I do not recommend you on buying this film. I do not recommend you renting this film. I do not recommend you on watching this film. In my opinion, the series is still 2 movies. I enjoy to pretend that this film was never made. It should have never been made. The 2nd worse time travel movie, next to Time Chasers. Avoid this piece of crap at all costs. Terminator 2 should have been the last one. Personally, I would like to send a Terminator back in time to stop this movie from being made. That is how bad this movie was. Just stay away. If you think that all sequels are better then one before, then this is for you. otherwise, just stay away. 3 out of 10 stars. Another CGI piece of bullcrap. If you have only seen the first 2 then you have seen it all. Do not watch this. I am doing you a favor. Please do not watch this. Thank you."
"laurapalmersdead","9","2","5","7 November 2007"," Better than T2
","When I heard Jim Cameron wasn't directing this version of The Terminator, I dismissed it as a money-grab flick. I was stunned to find out how good it was. The attraction of the Terminator films has never been in the excellence of their FX, but in the brilliance of their time-turning plot twists (which we could discuss for DAYS). Based on that criteria, I think this is almost as good as the original, and far superior to the FX-laden but plot-challenged T2. The ending is incredibly, and suitably, fatalistic. Having said that, the FX in this film are great! And best of all -- no Robert Patrick to stink things up! Absolutely brilliant!"
"jford-19","8","2","5","5 September 2007"," A solid if flawed follow up
","A lot of people thought this movie was a bad idea before it even materialised which meant that there was always going to be hostility to the finished product. Personally, i thought it was a cool idea - provided the filmmakers could come up with a good story. The end product beats the expectations of the haters but falls short of producing a truly amazing follow up.<br/><br/>The plus points of this movie are the amazing fx and chase scenes. The crane truck chase is one of my favourite action movie scenes ever, and is timed perfectly. The story line has been pushed along, with the realisation that Judgement Day cannot be stopped. This comes true at the end of the film with the bombs going off while some gentle classical music plays in the background. It's incredibly poignant for a Terminator movie and a great way to end the film. And of course, seeing Arnold as the now iconic Terminator when we all thought he'd bogged off to be a politician is a very welcome sight.<br/><br/>There are however, a lot of niggles that add up to a fair amount of disappointment for the true fans. Nick Stahl takes some getting used to and Claire Danes is just terrible with her granny hair cut and bad clothes. The return of Dr. Silberman is unnecessary, as is the gay sunglasses joke. <br/><br/>The most annoying aspect is in the continuity - the van that the good guys are driving hits at least 2 other vehicles at high speeds and gets squashed between 2 cop cars as well as being spun 360 yet when it is seen afterwards for a good few scenes it is intact! I can't believe this terrible blooper made it through! Its so obvious, even on first watch that it spoils the film for me.<br/><br/>Yet despite it's flaws T3 is a good solid action film, just like the recent Die Hard 4.0 - you know what you're getting and OK its a bit old hat, but for thrills alone it's definitely worth a watch."
"ad-thompson","5","2","5","5 March 2007"," Not Really Worthy Of Its Predecessors
","When the first 'Terminator' movie was released in 1984, the special effects were not that impressive, but the film had enough low-budget energy, enthusiasm and imagination on show that it made up for what it lacked from the technical aspects. 1991's mega-budget sequel was in many ways similar to the original, but with the wealth of spectacular, ground-breaking special effects on display, nobody really cared. <br/><br/>This belated second sequel, however, brings nothing new to the formula other than the addition of a female 'Terminatrix'. The ageing Arnie is no longer the mean, lean fighting machine that was so threatening twenty-odd years ago, looking more like an awkward old relative that just keeps hanging about. Former model Kristanna Loken does a decent job as the 'Terminatrix' (or 'T-X'), although she doesn't really have to do a lot of acting other than looking mean and emotionless. (She looks fantastic, though!). Nick Stahl as John Connor lacks the charisma that Edward Furlong brought to the role in 'T2', but the faithful Claire Danes does a fine job as the love interest, Kate Brewster. The script, though, insistent on giving Arnie a constant stream of one-liners referring back to - or parodying - the previous two movies, only serves to keep reminding us how much better James Cameron's originals were. <br/><br/>It does have its moments - there are some spectacular action sequences to be seen - but most of the time it only echoes what we've seen before. It may be worth seeing if you're an avid fan, but in the end it all feels a bit pointless. Rather than ending the series with a bang, it could have gone completely unnoticed."

","I loved this movie. I don't exactly know why I liked it so much, but I think it was just about everything.<br/><br/>I liked the second movie, but I that T3 had a higher level of sophistication and maturity as it ought to. There is nothing finer than a well produced movie with a full orchestra and a good, well presented theme. The themes in the first and second movies where transparent and never narrated, but if you look at T3, you will notice that the theme is so prominant that not only is it included in the subtitle just as in the second movie, but also the theme is narrated by John C. which I think is very important for setting a mood and I would say is appropriate in a sci-fi movie such as this one. Throught the whole movie character developement is strong. Arnold's character is used as both a metaphore of total annihilation and a foil for Nick's more fleshy character, John. Briliant. Additionally, the movie has great visuals and the action wasn't so quick that the projector couldn't keep up. The action was however largescale and very exciting while believable.<br/><br/>My only beef with this movie is that it was too good to only be 120 minutes long. That's what a lot of people have been complaining about and I think they're 100% right. Let's hope the DVD has lots of extra scenes!<br/><br/>Good Day!"

"Terminaisha","1","2","5","15 August 2003"," What the hell was that?
","After seeing T2 on video, complete with directors cuts, I though T2 was the best movie I'd ever seen in my life. Emotion mixed with action, complete with plot and believeable characters. Great! So I was all hyped up when T3 came out, and went to see it at the first showing in my cinema... I came out thinking why was that so good? Where did the $185m budget all go? It was all just blowing stuff up. Even the T-x was a disappointment- she just didn't seem that much more advanced (compared to the T-1000). And John... the way he acted just didn't seem like John! He wasn't the way I thought he'd be... Basically, I thought T3 was pretty rubbish, and to me it was a big disappointment. The storyline was... well, nonexistant, the dialogue (especially from the T-800) sounded forced and like they were just going for the jokes. Terminator is not a comedy, so don't try and make it one! Any humour that should be in it comes naturally. And that's about all I have to say..."
"Win14Gipp","1","2","5","7 July 2003"," My God, did this suck
","The story was dark enough from beginning to end to make Eugene O'Neill cringe. The acting was nonexistent, and the script seemed geared mainly to get the viewers from one overblown set of special effects to the next. (SPOILER NEXT) And the idea that the very place that has been squirreled away in the middle of nowhere and prepared specifically for a nuclear disaster would A) be deserted at the moment of truth and B) have nothing but a ham radio and a podium for the President to speak at is ludicrous even by modern-movie standards. I am normally a fan of Schwarzenegger's work, but this one had me wondering how badly he needed the paycheck."
"Asteri-Atypical","3","2","5","6 July 2003"," Decent action but doesn't live up to the Terminator legend
","All the action but almost none of the story...<br/><br/>The Hollywood pattern is alive and well in T3.<br/><br/>What pattern?  That Hollywood cannot follow up classics with similar quality.  That Hollywood cannot remake a movie or a legend and preserve the power or depth of the original storyline.  That Hollywood will almost always place effects and action above good storytelling.<br/><br/>T3 had good ""Terminator action"".  As we would expect with T3's budget and current FX technology, the fight and sequences were great eye candy. Certainly, that's one ingredient of the Terminator movies.  However, unlike T2, there was nothing groundbreaking or cutting edge here.<br/><br/>As for the story; well... let me not belabor the details.  That would not be fair, as T3 made itself such an easy target.  Suffice it to say the story doesn't live up to the two Terminator predecessors.  The overall story was pale, indeed, compared with T1 and T2.  Add to that more plot holes that a T-800's flesh covering has at the end of each movie.  Even the dates don't add up when John talks about his age as various events occur.  It was a barely above average plot with very little care given to the details. Barely above average for movies in general; but T1 and T2 were well above average.<br/><br/>The directing struck me as average.  Sure, there were some great action sequences, especially in the chase scenes.  Nonetheless, the camera angles, the lighting, the gripping photgraphy; all those elements which Cameron added in T1 and T2 just were not present in T3.  The overall ""artistry"" was competent but inferior to T1 & T2.<br/><br/>Acting was decent, with the exception of the T-X.  Loken had the look and knows how to strike a pose but when she spoke, she just didn't grip me. Neither her voice nor articulation added to the mystery or the menace which should be the T-X.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie worth watching.  As I mentioned, the action and FX are good.  There are some great lines and a couple moments of visual humour.  Where this movie fails is that it does not live up to its legend, especially after a haitus of many years.  Indeed, it was reminicient of Star Wars Episode I in that respect.<br/><br/>Utlimately it's worth watching but I would consider this installment to be a major letdown considering that we waited 12 years hoping for a movie of at least similar quality to T2."
"MsCarla21","10","2","5","28 November 2003"," A good fun movie
","Well its no Terminator 2 Judgement day which still rates as the best of the trilogy, but its still a good film.  I think why I personally like it so much as it completes the movie cycle.  In the first film we when shown glimpses of a possible future and same in T2, but in the closing momments of T3, we see the cycle complete as the Skynet takes over and starts the nuclear holocaust.<br/><br/>My favorite moment has to be the ending, in the 2nd film we had hope for the future, and up until the end of T3 we had the same hope.  All that changes the moment they realise that they are in a bunker.  I personally felt the angst as they knew that there was nothing they could do to stop Skynet.  I had tears in my eyes as the missiles launched and we saw humanity reduced to shreds, it was a powerful emotional ending.  Director Jonathan Mostow should be congratulated for a risky ending which works.<br/><br/>In order that we can enjoy the first two movies, this ending which was a total shock has to happen.  The script I confess is a little weak and it does lack James Camerons magic touch, but i did enjoy the film and I really think its a good one to end the series.  I love the terminator movies but I think it should end here.<br/><br/>I personally rate 3.5 out of 5, not the best but still a good movie."

","This movie is really, really bad.  It is horrible in comparison to the other ""T"" movies.  I don't know how this thing is up to a 7.0 out of 10.  Where do they get these actors.  The only one who is even remotely convincing (and she was indeed remotely convincing) was the Claire Danes chick.  What a horribly scripted film.  Arnie's lines remind me of that Vanilla Ice movie; bad one liner after bad one liner.  The T-X girl doesn't even have a line. And why was she supposed to be more impressive than the T-1000?  Because she can hotwire a car?  And did they really kill her off the same way they killed Arnold off in the first Terminator?  You have GOT to be kidding me. The only potential saving grace is the fact that this movie is so bad, that there is a lot of unintentionally funny moments, such as the T-101's ""moral dilemma"", and a lot of the plot is comically bad.  Talk about corny.  Can Arnold even act?  I have seen a lot of his movies, and he tends to play the wooden meathead with limited vocabulary very well.  I believe we saw it in T1, T2, T3, Kindergarten Cop, Twins, Commando, and every other movie I've ever seen him in.  ""She'll be back"", ""I'm back"", ""Talk to the hand"":  If these phrases are what you want to hear over and over, then by all means, go see this terrible movie.  I believe I've heard them enough from 9 year olds imitating this movie, that I can't believe I wasted my time watching it.  At least I didn't pay for it.  I give it 2 out of 10, and that's only for the unintentionally comedic plot points."

"Leofwine_draca","8","2","6","11 November 2016"," Not up to the level of the first two, but it's still a great sci-fi action flick
","To start off with, TERMINATOR 3 is just not up to the level of its two predecessors. The first two films in the series were classics, skilfully made by James Cameron with an eye for perfection and detail, timeless masterpieces to be watched over and over again. Watching Arnie progress from vindictive killer to humanitarian robot was a great emotional experience and one that my generation grew up with. For TERMINATOR 3, all of the emotion and drama has gone; what we're left with is just another action-orientated summer blockbuster, albeit a very good action-orientated summer blockbuster. No more subtext or detail; no more perfectly-crafted movie. But the action – the action alone makes this a must-see.<br/><br/>The plot is basically the same as that of TERMINATOR 2, at least for the first two thirds of the film. There is a heck of a lot of action packed into a relatively short time. Wicked shoot-outs with police in a graveyard, the mother of all showdowns between two machines in a lavatory (amazing stuff), people being executed in cold blood, plus much much more. The violence has been toned down but the film still packs a brutal edge – watch out for the stomach punch to see what I mean. By far the greatest action sequence is the exhilarating crane chase, which is absolutely classic, one of the best chases I've ever seen; truly the highlight in cinematic viewing this year. A real pulse-pounding thrill-ride which makes up for any deficiencies the film might otherwise have. Director Jonathan Mostow cut his teeth on the thriller genre with the little-seen but very good Kurt Russell starrer BREAKDOWN, before going on to make the superior submarine epic U-571. All these films have had great direction and very well handled action, making Mostow once one of the most promising action directors in today's cinema.<br/><br/>Back to TERMINATOR 3. Arnold is back, inevitably, and he's older but still in great shape. His terminator here is colder, less human, but with a fine line in quips and one-liners; indeed most of his dialogue is monosyllabic, quotable stuff. He doesn't really get time to connect with the audience, but he holds his own in the action sequences, and to see an actor returning to his best role after a somewhat lean period is a real pleasure; hats off to Arnie for making this film work. Linda Hamilton is gone now but long forgotten; her character had nowhere else to go. Claire Danes plays a younger version of the Sarah Connor-style fighter, and is pretty good. But the best performance goes to Nick Stahl as John Connor, playing a mentally scarred drug addict going through some very hard times.<br/><br/>Kristanna Loken is all right as the Terminatrix, although its hard to see her as a serious menace. The clashes between her and Arnie make for classic entertainment, and I especially loved the hard-hitting sound effects which accompany them. Other things to watch and listen out for are a welcome cameo from Earl Boen (the only other actor to appear in all three films with Schwarzenegger) and Marco Beltrami's effective orchestral score; it's sad that Brad Fiedel's classic theme is relegated to the closing credits, but to be fair Beltrami does a good job and I'd like to see him go far. The finale of the film moves into new territory (instead of just being a rehash of the TERMINATOR 2 plot) as the machines come to life, leading to plenty of mass destruction and gunfire; excellent again. Special effects (both mechanical, pyrotechnic, and CGI) are remarkable. The moment where Arnie struggles against his programming is good, even if it does show up the star's limitations. In comparison, the final showdown between the two damaged robots is far too rushed and unmemorable; you barely have time to register what happened. The way is paved for a fourth instalment with a downer of an ending which is the most unexpected and remarkable thing in the whole movie. TERMINATOR 3 isn't a great movie by any means, but instead a good movie with some great action and only a few flaws. Check it out."

","So we're through with T2, probably the best sequel ever came out... Now it's time for the third one in the franchise: Rise Of The Machines. Before watching this film, I took a look at the cast, writers and the director. When I noticed the changes, I knew I'm going to see an average Arnold film. It wasn't better than my expectations, nor was it worse than that. I'm just glad it's not awful. Let's start with the positives first: The directing is pretty great, the script is also good, the dialog was good at best, the action was fantastic and the comedy was well-handled. Now the let's talk about why it's not perfect: Some characters didn't get as much screen time as they should've, the first 40 minutes (!!!) were just an unexplained action exposition, the story wasn't that great, and it was pretty hard to feel bad for their characters, even though we learn about them as the film progresses. Overall, it's a pretty awesome action film. If you're only looking for awesome action scenes and comedy, you won't be disappointed. If you want a good story and expect to see what made T2 one of the best action films ever- forget about this movie and move on."

","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003): Dir: Jonathan Mostow / Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, Kristanna Loken, David Andrews: Money all over the screen without a shred of screenplay worth its budget. It is about man at the mercy of what he created. In this case the audience must suffer for what was created here. It repeats the same exhausted setup with hero and villain terminators falling to earth. What follows are endless scenes of violence with an ending that bears reference to the much better original. Director Jonathan Mostow previously made a much better thriller in Breakdown but here it is the production that matters. This is easily the worst film in the franchise and nowhere near as good or even provocative as the original film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is still effective as the terminator sent to protect John Connor and Kate Brewster but the issue here is that he is merely reciting what he has done before and better. Kristanna Loken as a female terminator is a great thought but its seductive nature is nothing more than a joke. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes as John and Kate are hardly interesting. They have all the personality of a rusty nail. The film exists mainly for its budget if anything at all. It seems to terminate everything else. Linda Hamilton's presence is sadly missing but then again, so is the screenwriter's. Score: 3 / 10"

","This is a dire movie, it's so bad I do not even consider there to be 3 Terminator movies. It has been made simply for the money (look at its certificate compared to the first two, its clearly aimed at the bigger target audience); it's been made for the sake of being made. It is an insult to the first two excellent movies. Personally I would of preferred it if they simply left it at two movies, this third instalment makes fun of a lot of the stuff that made the first two movies cool. It is more of a comedy than anything else and a bad one at that. Its rating certainly doesn't reflect this movies quality (or lack of); I think it gets a lot of votes from kids who know nothing about the original movies and just like it for its big budget special effects. <br/><br/>Watch this movie once and then burn it."

Static dialogue and conflicting emotions does not a great movie make. I'm sure everyone got paid well and there's food on the table, that's great, but if the movie industry ever wondered why people pirate movies its so that we don't feel so ripped off when we shell out 15$ for a mistake. The most entertaining part of the movie was counting the explosions with my cousin, cause then we came up with explosion subcategories. Explosions that are caused by realistic existing incendiary devices ie. gas pipelines, and then there's the non realistic ie. dirt and concrete. Apparently concrete and dirt are actually flammable, huh."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","2","6","20 March 2006"," Not as good as I had hoped, not as bad as I had feared.
","This was a real 'middle of the road' movie. It was not as good as I had hoped but it also was not as bad as I had feared at the same time. Like most other people, I was skeptical about this movie. I mean Terminator 3 without James Cameron and Robert Patrick as villain but an yet inexperienced director and girl as villain instead? I feared the worst but at the same time I hoped that the movie might become as good as it's predecessors ""Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". It surely had the potential and budget for that. In the end ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" might not be as good as the previous two Terminator movies but at least it's just as enjoyable.<br/><br/>Basically this movie is just a great action-flick. I already knew that Jonathan Mostow was capable of directing a good action movie after seeing ""U-571"", so I might not had been as skeptical as most others about Mostow directing this movie. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" also is a wonderfully directed action movie that has some highly memorable and well constructed action sequences in it. It really is due to Mostow's skills that this movie is better than the average action-flick. The movie features so great shootouts, fistfights and car chases, of which the one with the large crane truck the most memorable one. The high budget is notable in the movie and lots of stuff blows up and gets demolished. Budget well spend in this case, I say!<br/><br/>It's not the story that makes this movie a good one. Even though it by no means is a bad story, it just lacks any real depth and emotion. The movie however sets things nicely up for a ""Terminator 4"" movie. I for one, am really looking forward to this movie, if it ever gets made. I also certainly wouldn't mind seeing Jonathan Mostow returning to direct, if James Cameron is not available/won't do it.<br/><br/>The movie is well cast. Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role of 'The Terminator'. He however is given a lot more dialog this time, which perhaps was not the most wise choice, since Arnie's acting skills are highly below average. But perhaps that's also part of the charm. He yet again delivers some cheesy one-liners and the movie as a whole is surprisingly comical at times, especially when compared to the previous two Terminator movies. I think it's great that they actually picked an actor to play John Conner, who actually looked like Edward Furlong, who played John Conner in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". Nick Stahl is a great new John Conner. He also has some nice chemistry with his love interest played by Claire Danes. Kristanna Loken tries very hard to surpass Robert Patrick's performance from ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" but she unfortunately hasn't got enough charisma for that.<br/><br/>The movie is just nothing more than an awesome action flick. Action movie fans will absolutely love this movie. But the movie does get a git unnecessary violent at times. The movie features lots of killing of innocent persons. It's a bit too much and over-the-top perhaps at times, even for my taste, even though I'm used to seeing a lot worse in some movies. This movie simply just didn't needed that. The special effects of the movie are just great and work convincing. The nice action musical score is from Marco Beltrami. Marco Beltrami is a great and talented action movie composer that hasn't yet got the recognition which he deserves.<br/><br/>Perhaps not as impressive and good as the previous two Terminator movies but as an action-flick this movie is just totally awesome!<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Read the posting by ""J Akerberg from Sweden"" and agreed that T3 peed all over the original Terminator movie. Dialogue and acting was atrocious. Special effects were good, but then we've all learned to expect that these days with the amazing advances in computer animation, etc. However, T3 was fraught with so many technical mistakes. Anyone notice the huge white ""X"" in the middle of an intersection when during a chase scene, the car spun about in the middle of the intersection - obviously directed to do so on the conspicuous X. What about when the Terminator (Arnie) was walking back and forth at a campground fetching weaponry while John Connor and what's her name yapped. That scene must have had live audio recorded because with those heavy combat boots Schwarzie was wearing, his voice jarred with every step. If he was the robot he was advertised to be, his voice would not falter while he walked (oh, unless someone wants to argue that the machines had thought of every way to emulate human physical dynamics). No. Had real thought been put into this movie, it could have been much better and much scarier. I loved the original Terminator movie. This sequel was (as my gut instinct told me it would be) a disappointment. So I just sat back and enjoyed it for the FX and I replaced some of their dialogue with my own ideas that would have made it funnier. Some business, this Hollywood. It seems to make money on whatever it stamps out of its assembly lines. Just goes to show how low the American public's expectations are."

","The day before its opening in theaters, I was just so excited. Terminator 3 who could believe it, it was amazing, could it be even better then Terminator 2? The answer was, NO!! What a disappointment, I felt like sh*t after the movie finished. What did they do to it!! Terminator was no longer the serious and heroic character, he was a stupid clown in screen! They messed it up. The movie s*cked not a little, but just a lot! Great special effects indeed but almost all day light scenes, comic and stupid look for terminator, lost characters, no emotion, no intensity, no fear, nothing. All the great master piece created by James Cameron in Terminator 1&2 was lost! I'm sorry to say but if you have not seen the movie and loved the first 2, don't watch it, trust me! This movie was made with one thing in mind, MONEY. They did not care about the story, the thriller or the characters. Just the money. NO wonder Cameron did not direct the third part, he wrote the story for and to finish in 2 movies, they just wrote on top to do the third one!<br/><br/>Terminator 3, is not just the worst of all the terminators but a waste of time to watch. Other low budget action flicks, including Terminator 1 itself do 10 times better than this. I just hope that they do not go for Terminator 4, I would not take the risk to see it.

There really isn't anyway they can top the previous movies without going overboard in one department and lagging in more critical ones.  T2 proved that.  How many different ways can they make the same car chase?<br/><br/>Jonathan Mostow is competent as a director, but he lacks James Cameron's legendary touch.  ""B-o-o-h-o-o.""  Arnold, to quote Danny Glover in ""Lethal Weapon"", is 'getting too old for this sh**'.  His Terminator role lacks the villainy of the first movie or the sympathy of the second.  Everything else is unfamiliar and inferior.<br/><br/>Overall, an unnecessary sequel.  Correction, make that an unnecessary sequel with a tremendously overblown budget.

","Terminator 3 has the misfortune of following up on Terminator 1 & 2: an impossibly difficult task that can only result in shortcomings if James Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd and Linda Hamilton aren't even touching this production at all. Terminator 3 is a noble if fatally flawed follow-up on two of sci-fi cinema's greatest stories; there was no way Terminator 3 could follow up on the T-1000 in Judgement Day and the story there was wrapped up just nicely. So where was the real need to continue? Well, it was because Judgement Day was a box office tsunami: and they HAD to do a sequel in some form I guess.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 is a well-meaning but overly-stuffed and pandering venture in the Terminator canon. It's loaded with fan-service in reference to the first two Terminators: there's that psychologist from the first two movies, and the T-800's pacifism in T-2 is visually referenced in the form of 'Human Casualties: 000' screen-text from Arnie's point-of-view. Noble efforts, but it's unnecessary if it doesn't add anything new to the story.<br/><br/>T-3 is okay.

Nick Stahl arguably does a half decent job in furthering the John Connor story, would it have been better with Furlong? Who knows.<br/><br/>The story was a gift really, as we prepare for Skynet becoming self aware. This is what the story arc has been leading up to.... Judgement Day. It's also the 1st time that we hear that it's not been erased but just postponed, something that other sequels including Dark Fate would borrow to explain and justify their existence.<br/><br/>The addition of a female terminator in the TX is an interesting twist and an evolution on what had gone before, she was certainly played straight in a similar vein to Robert Patrick's T-1000.<br/><br/>The same can't be said for Arnie who is playing it for laughs at times almost as a parody of the T-800 he first portrayed. This is probably my main issue with this film, as the franchise looks to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Shame.<br/><br/>The ending was an interesting twist on the narrative that had been built up, judgement day can't be stopped only survived. I didn't see that coming and I was surprised. This set the franchise up for John Connor truly leading the resistance. Something that we kind of got in Salvation, kind of.<br/><br/>So, should you see this movie? Yes it's an interesting study on how to take a movie franchise on after two cracking instalments and the departure of arguably the main reason for that success.....James Cameron.

John says in his closing narration that Skynet no longer has a single, central location. It has dispersed itself over the internet into millions of computers. Fine.<br/><br/>Except I'm fairly confident that the internet would stop working in the event of a global nuclear war.<br/><br/>Most of the computers in the world, like most of the people, are in cities. And those computers would be destroyed along with everything else in those cities when they were nuked. Not to mention that most of the infrastructure that connects those computers would also be destroyed.<br/><br/>Most of the computers that were not physically destroyed would be rendered inoperative by the EMPs from hundreds of nuclear detonations. Not to mention that most of them would lose power as well.<br/><br/>Skynet is a computer program. It can't survive without electricity, and a computer with enough memory to contain it. If it dispersed itself across the internet, and then nuked most of the technology that makes the internet work, it would essentially be committing suicide.<br/><br/>That's my two cents about that."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' is the sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The movie is directed by Jonathan Mostow. The story is written John Brancato, Michael Ferris, and Tedi Sarafian. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, and Kristanna Loken. The movie takes place many years after the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. John Connor, played by Nick Stahl, is living off the grid. Skynet re-emerges through a new model called the T-X to assassinate John Connor's lieutenants. The threat of another Judgment Day becomes inevitable as the threat of Skynet still looms.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is an unnecessary sequel. The movie simply did not need to be made after the conclusion of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The second Terminator movie had ended the franchise in a satisfying way. The sequel is still serviceable. The movie is well-directed for the most part. There are fun and exciting action scenes in this movie. The truck chase scene is one of the highlights in this movie. The cast overall do a good job. The movie is still serviceable and the movie as a whole suffers from lack of a reason to exist.<br/><br/>The villain in this movie is the T-X. The new terminator is a hybrid between the T-800 and the T-1000. The new terminator assumes a female appearance. The terminator is set up well throughout the movie. The T-X is able to maintain an intimidating presence, but it is not nearly as strong as the T-1000 in the previous movie. There are interesting aspects that the T-X has such as advanced weaponry that it possesses from the future. The movie makes this abundantly clear and focuses on it. However, the alien-like quality of the T-1000 is missing here and that ultimately causes the villain to suffer.<br/><br/>The movie does not have John Connor as the solo protagonist. Katherine Brewster, played by Claire Danes, and the T-850, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, also share the role of the protagonist. The movie commonly moves between these characters and the lack of true focus on John Connor can be distracting. The movie should have been more about John Connor, but he does not embark on a memorable character arc in this movie. John Connor has the arc of being the savior of humanity. It was not satisfying to see it as there was nothing special to see about it. John Connor simply accepts his fate and becomes the savior. Katherine Brewster on the other hand goes from a vulnerable woman to someone that takes a stand against the machines. This arc was slightly more satisfying but it suffered from lack of focus. The entire story did not work well. The T-850 is a centerpiece and the character development of the T-800 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day is copied over to this movie. It did not make any sense for this T-850 unit to behave the same exact way as the T-800 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Even knowing that Katherine Brewster had sent the T-850 unit back, it felt like there was no reason for its behavior to be the same as the previous movie.<br/><br/>Jonathan Mostow does an admirable job trying to create a Terminator sequel. However, the sequel does not have the same impact as the second movie did versus the first. I would still recommend the movie despite this flaw.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

","Terminator 3 (2003) Review<br/><br/>Follow up to T2 several years after they prevented Judgment Day John Connor is in his mid twenties and his mother Sarah Connor has passed away. Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong (most likely due to his recent drug hiatus) Stahl is actually quite good in the role. He plays him as a conflicted lost person who has nightmares about the apocalypse. Arnold is back and remarkably hasn't aged a day since the twelve year gap from last film. He once again plays the good terminator but this time to protect someone else too. Now of course Arnold is brilliant in the role, he was born to play this character and he always gives it 100%. The film elevates every time he's on screen. <br/><br/>The villain is female but this time is a step back from the last one. The T-X played by Kristina Loken isn't as terrifying as the other villains but is still very deadly. She seems like downgrade as she has an exo-skeleton with a liquid metal exterior but thankfully she can still imitate other people. We all know that exo-skeletons can be destroyed a lot easier than the T-1000 which was purely just liquid metal. But there are a few interesting things to her in that she can manipulate machines and vehicles to wreak havoc and she also has a built in gun which looks really cool. <br/><br/>Director Jonathan Mostow who previously helmed the Kurt Russell thriller Breakdown does a more than average job here. It's clear he wasn't in full control with so many producers breathing down his neck telling him how to make the film. He does his best with the often silly script by John Brancato and Michael Ferris. One thing he delivers well on is the action sequences. <br/><br/>T3 is full of great action scenes from two chase sequences, a police hold up which goes awry and an exciting bathroom fight. However some of these action scenes are exaggerated to the max with some of them going on for far too long like the bathroom fight and the first chase sequence. There is an awful lot of CGI - One scene where the terminator has to reconnect his head would have looked a lot better had it been done with animatronics. The bathroom confrontation between the two terminators also looks very cartoonish at times. There's a nice use of practical effects in parts but it ultimately relies on some often dated looking CG animations. <br/><br/>The majority of the time it delivers but there are too many self deprecating moments from the often cartoon like sound effects and the constant self referential gags to the first movies. There are a few dumb character moments, some annoying characters and it's peppered with one too many cheesy one liners like ""Talk to the hand"" and ""I like your gun"". But the film redeems itself running at a brisk pace of 100 minutes it has some good character interactions, effective action scenes, great cinematography and a surprisingly sombre ending. It's not a classic like the first two but it's far from terrible."

","This might actually have worked, if only some very bad CGI decisions were not made and most of all, now, a 15 years later, it is clear that the soundtrack is absolutely horrible. The score messes up everything. Not only does it not match the size of the picture (scenic size, music is too static and too close, making the image look small) but also it is wishful, meaning that the score is trying to add emotional aspects that are improper and unfitting to what is actually displayed. Someone might have been really really excited to do this score and might have had an overenthusiastic producer, but the central idea of the movie was not understood. If the score had been more traditional and not overexcited, the whole title could have been a decent 7.8

","The third film in the ""Terminator"" franchise deteriorates to the level of cheap action SF. (When I say cheap I'm not referring to budget, of course.) It does not bring anything new either in the story nor visually, but copies the previous film with essentially insignificant variations. Action scenes are greatly done, but since the film is virtually reduced to an endless series of explosions, it soon becomes tedious. Nick Stahl, in my opinion, is not an adequate substitute for Edward Furlong, Clare Danes is made for romantic movies and she was thorn in my eye through the whole thing, absence of Linda Hamilton feels too much, and the Schwarzenegger performance is weaker than in previous movies, although this is more to the script than to him. Practically the only thing worth watching in this movie is the beautiful Kristanna Loken in the role of the latest Terminator model.

","Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as The Terminator in ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.""<br/><br/>When I was 13 back in 2003, I first saw this and was quite blown away by it. I had to a least see it twice, but a couple of years later I started to sour from it. Even my mom said it wasn't as good as the first two films, and I had to respectfully agree it's not.<br/><br/>However, recently a couple of yeas ago I have found myself starting to like this film again.<br/><br/>This may contain some spoilers.<br/><br/>The year is 2003. The newest nemesis from the future arrives in the form of a woman this time, The TX.<br/><br/>She is here to eliminate John Connor's Lieutenants to ensure the machines victory.<br/><br/>Later the Terminator arrives and teams up with a now adult John, he informs him about the TX and how he is not sure if he can defeat her, along the way they find a young woman that is a veterinarian and that her fate is linked to john's.<br/><br/>With time running out, they quickly learn the young woman's military father is unknowingly about to activate Sky-net it's self. Which actives the rise of the machines.<br/><br/>A weak entry in the franchise but usually third parts are, let me into the positives here.<br/><br/>First I would like to say Arnold Schwarzenegger was great in his return to his famous roll. Even though this version of the character is a little less friendly form his T2 counterpart. Arnold was still cool as always.<br/><br/>The action scenes were very good here, lots of expositions and gun battles. The vehicle stunt work is amazing and quite impressive with very little CG. Even the CG work is still good even by today's standers.<br/><br/>Now for some of the negatives, now this dose not apply to everything else in the movie, just some things.<br/><br/>Kristana Loken is OK as the TX character, however I mostly blame the writers for this. They just made her a sexy character that's all brawn and no brains. Not that I don't like her being sexy because I do, It would have worked out better if she was more scary and intimidating.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl is OK as John Connor, but I feel ether he wasn't written well enough or if it was the actor I can't tell.<br/><br/>Claire Danes is pretty good as Kate Brewster, but she wasn't given enough to work with.<br/><br/>It has it's flaws but, I still think I does the job, it's still entertaining. I know some people sort of hate it like I did for a time, but It's a cupcake. It's a nice frothy cupcake and if you look at it as that it can be a wonderful piece of froth.<br/><br/>I give it a 5.3/10 it's not bad more of a so-so action thriller, but it can be a real good time in the right mind set. If your a fan of the franchise give it a look."

","Coming Soon- Terminator 4 : Warriors of the Wasteland ???? Not really, I just made that title up....

After all, didn't Jim Cameron have a breakthrough success with ""ALIENS""...and he didn't produce the first one... so I kept an open mind<br/><br/>This one had much more humor in it than the 2 previous films, the whole theater erupted with uncontrollable laughter at the ""TALK TO THE HAND!"" scene at the beginning of the film. The chase scene was great too (MATRIX 2's chase scene blows T3's chase Scene away). and yes the plot did have some holes.... but I can over look those holes because the plot holes seem to be what keeps the story line going from one film to the next (in other words, plot holes are a necessary evil if you want to keep the story going).<br/><br/>I couldn't help but feel like this film was acting as a bridge story that is setting the stage for future Terminator movies (probably without Arnald)that will take place in the futuristic post nuclear war landscape where humans are fighting the war against the machines....<br/><br/>In a strange kinda way, I hope that is exactly what is happening with this franchise... we'll see in the future<br/><br/>I give this film 7 out of 10 stars -go see it, its pretty good"

So it's not a bad movie or good movie, it's a middle movie the Bad: The effects look like a cartoon and from a kids show like that green lantern show on go and Cartoon Network, too much making fun of itself and not taking it seriously, it sort of ripped off T2 because 2 terminators ones evil ones good kill each other in the end and THEN WE dramatic ending The Good: The Action with the truck flipping over and the exploding Arnie-Bot into the shed and THE ENDING IS SO SHOCKING AND DRAMATIC and the chase scenes are stunning Don't hate on me if you say it's a great movie. I personally think this movie is NOT garbage and rather just an entertaining popcorn exciting action movie and well I don't think it stands near T2 but rather just in the middle half between The Terminator and half before the terminator so this. T3(half) T1 T3(half) T2. I would recommend it just for entertainment and those who like action and explosions and one liners."
"grintemcstinger","6","1","2","13 August 2015"," How many times does he intent to say ""...back.""?
","Terminator 3, what can I say... It's probably one of the most difficult movies to have humble expectations first time around after seeing the previous movies of the franchise. How can you not expect it to be great as the prequels were - this is The Terminator we're talking about, right? Right?<br/><br/>Ever since seeing Terminator 2 I always wondered if there would be another entry. How would they follow it up and possibly top them? As time passed there were various rumors here and there, but never anything concrete for a long time. James Cameron was involved, then he was not and so on and so forth. There were comics that I found to be quite interesting and served as tie-ins to both T1 and T2, in which you would for example see where the T1000 got his look from and what happened in the future war with its own twists and turns of events. I found it to be solid material that could be used for reference when making a third movie. After all, the future where the war with Skynet is happening and both Kyle Reese and the terminators are send back in time is the least covered part in the previous movies, and at one point did happen either way, wherever it was avoided in T2 or not. So to me it was the only logical way a third one would've been made, if at all, and it sort of would be both a prequel and sequel.<br/><br/>Then, after a too long time when the hype kinda laid down, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines came along, and right of the bat it looked like they didn't have any new ideas. Even from the trailer I could tell that they were playing it safe and pretty much rehashed the second one. Watching the movie for the fist time was like playing the waiting game, when would something wow me? We're still stuck with the same, old characters that are supposed to be humanity saviors only this time completely without any notable development towards it. And when the end-credits rolled I was left unimpressed and thought to myself ""well, that's just a so much weaker version of T2"". It didn't do anything new, at all. At that time I couldn't even point out a single thing that stood out to me. It was just one giant ""meh"". <br/><br/>Thrill and fear - completely gone. Creativity - huh, what!? Character development, emotions, purpose - not much here. Moving and powerful music - absent. Fear inducing and horrifying villain - nope, you just get this sort of T1000 with T800 parts and gimmicks tacked on that's here just for the action. No message, no meaningful conflict, no nightmares, no deeper meaning, nada, niente.<br/><br/>Instead of everything mentioned you get: good action with some notable scenes and enough oomph. Campy humor that is often too much on the nose and more than once feels like a spoof of the second movie, almost reaching Scary Movie-like levels in some scenes. And a overabundance of the same one-liners now with slight variations. Seriously, people loved them in T2, but that wasn't by far the main thing. It was rather the cherry on top and way better implemented in small amounts and way more natural. Here it seemed that everything happening is for the purpose of forcing as much as possible of them down your throat and blowing sh*t up for the sake of blowing sh*t up. It's like they misunderstood or didn't bother to understand the appeal of the Terminator movies and just went with the f-yeah action.<br/><br/>But after watching it a few more times I came to appreciate it for what it is. Had it been completely unrelated to the Terminator saga it would be much easier to enjoy it and pass it as a decent popcorn action flick. The main problems are the truly giant steps it has to fill in and the pressure while making it must've been immense. Jonathan Mostov actually does a fairly competent, sans the humorous parts, job and at certain times it does feel slightly like a Terminator movie. Its the writing that is just so incredibly lazy. Maybe it was indeed the smarter move in playing it safe as the perfection the previous movies achieved is truly something that does happen very rarely, so it may have underwhelm either way. It's not a bad movie, but it just tremendously pales in comparison and is hindered by having to live up to two of the greatest movies of all time. The ending is solid and a good way to lead into the dark future - it fits surprisingly well into the whole saga, however anything before that was, sadly, completely unnecessary and spread thin to the movies run time."
"Tyson14","7","1","2","19 July 2015"," Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" Rises To New Levels
","The film picks up a number of years after the last feature as we see John Connor (Stahl), future leader and Saviour of the human race, in his mid twenties (I'd guess), living 'off the grid' since the events from the last film (if you haven't seen the previous two films I don't know what the heck you're doing here, but whatever...). Turns out 'judgment day' was not averted, as initially thought at the end of the 2nd film, but only postponed, as Skynet is around in some form, as indicated by the arrival of a Terminator robot, a model T-X played by Loken. It seems now the future is populated by really hot and sexy blonde robots with definite feminine characteristics...homina, homina...soon after we see another Terminator arrive, the muscled one we're more accustomed to, played by Arnold. Seems the T-X model, or Terminatrix Bot has been sent back to target Connor, but if it can't get to him, it's supposed to go after those who would be his lieutenants, including that of Kate Brewster (Danes), whose father, played by Andrews, just happens to be some military bigwig in charge of the program which will eventually become Skynet, the artificial intelligence that will eventually take over the world, exterminating the human threat. Make sense? Probably not...anyway, given this new threat, someone from within the resistance from the future decided to send back an Arnold robot to protect whomever needed protecting, but its task a difficult one given the sophistication of the T-X model, which is essentially an enhanced logic weapons systems cybernetic combat infiltration unit with nanotechnological transjectors inside a titanium battle chassis surrounded by a mimetic poly alloy...whew! So what does all that mean? Well, it can manipulate machines under computer control, tap into communications systems, and produce weaponry from within, including a wicked plasma cannon from its arm, among other things. Things aren't looking so good for John (or the human race, for that matter), but did I mention the Terminatrix is really hot?<br/><br/>Given the fact Terminator 2 made as much as it did at the box office, I'm not surprised someone decided to continue on with the franchise, despite the fact the story had been pretty much wrapped up at the end of the second film. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines does try to fit itself within the continuity of the previous two films, and, on the surface it succeeds, but once you start picking at the loose threads, there are inconsistencies (then again, when we're talking about time travel, who's to say what could and couldn't happen?). Now, I'm not going to go through and relate all the bits I thought out of place as I'm sure many have already done so, and done so a lot better than I could have, but I will say if you take this movie at face value (a straight up action film), you'll probably have a lot more fun. There was one bit that really bothered me, though, and that was when John, Kate, and the Arnold Bot were trying to contact Kate's father, who just happened to be secured away in some top-secret military installation. One minute they're driving towards the place and the next they're inside, talking to Kate's father...I suppose the Arnold Bot could have bypassed the security somehow, but it all seemed rather convenient, especially given the circumstances. I did like the whole bit about a widespread virus running through the Internet, where it came from, and its ultimate purpose. The characters in this film seemed to take a backseat to the action, as none are really developed as much as they were in the previous films. Perhaps the filmmakers were relying on the character development already out there from the earlier films, but given so few characters carried over, this didn't work out so well. One of the biggest weaknesses in the film, in my opinion, was that of Stahl's character of John Connor. There seemed to be an awful lot of inconsistencies indicating perhaps this wasn't the same John Connor as was in the previous movie. I'm not a big fan of Stahl (he reminds me too much of Giovanni Ribisi, whom I care even less for), but I thought he did pretty well in the film Sin City (2005). As far as Danes, well, she looked good, but her performance was limited by her role, as it was written. While the plot and the characters may have been half-baked, at least the action was balls out. My favourite bit involved a car chase sequence featuring a gigantic crane truck barreling through city streets, causing massive amounts of destruction. Another great bit was when the two Terminators were fighting each other within the military base, and the Arnold Bot uses a urinal as an offensive weapon. The first time I saw this film and the ending was presented I found myself saying ""What the f***?"", but, after watching it again last night it did seem to make sense in terms of the story presented. All in all I thought this a great action film, but in terms of a sequel to the Terminator series, it was so-so...I'd agree with Cameron that there really wasn't anything left to tell in the story, but if there's a chance to make money, you know Hollywood will capitalize."
"Robert_duder","8","1","2","18 April 2015"," In its own right, its a ton of fun
","Terminator 3 is a total departure from the first two films. It perfectly fits the storyline and doesn't create too many glaring plot holes from the first two films. The problem is that there is a distinctive lack of brilliant artistic vision behind it. This was made to cash in and is made to be a mainstream action/sci-fi flick. Taken at that value...I love it. Its fun and campy and absolutely non-stop action packed popcorn popping fun. If you love Schwarzenegger like I do...this is bread and butter for fans of his. He comes back swinging as his infamous Terminator role. Much like Terminator 2 there is a lot of campy scenes and they feel just a little more campy this time around but for some reason campy works in the context of this very real world they create. I think the cleverness behind Terminator 3 is that the action is so good and the pace is so fast that you forget its not as clever as the previous two films. This is all about Arnold and continuing the story and sort of a much expected prologue to Judgement Day. I think it would have been a very different film had James Cameron returned to direct but it is what it is and I enjoy it!! <br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the Terminator. He is more robotic this time and the low brow humour is toned down but it is lots of Arnold. If you look up the easter eggs in place for fans you'll enjoy it quite a bit. It isn't his most charismatic role and definitely not his best turn as the Terminator (I hope that is still to come with Genisys) but it is still great. While I'm not fond of them having a different John Connor every single time...Nick Stahl actually is really great in the role. He is very serious and brooding and plays the part well. His John Connor is a drifter, trying to find his way in the non-Judgement Day world and you actually believe he could become the Saviour of mankind. He doesn't have NEAR the chemistry with Schwarzenegger that Edward Furlong did but he still plays a good part and leads the cast well. Claire Danes is an interesting character and she plays the part well. She does have good chemistry with Stahl and Schwarzenegger and I actually wish she would come back to the series at some point playing Katherine Brewster. Kristanna Loken is interesting in her role. I always thought this would be her breakout role but she sort of slipped into B-Movie obscurity. She is actually extremely effective as the villainous and deadly T-X. She is stunningly beautiful but there is something campy about her performance too. Still she has few lines and her hand to hand battles with Schwarzenegger are excellent. They make worthy foes and while she isn't near as effective as Robert Patrick was but it works. While they manage to write out Sarah Connor, her spirit is alive and well in the story.<br/><br/>If you hold Terminator 3 up against T2 then you will hate...plain and simple. Terminator 2 is easily one of the best sci-fi/action films ever made period and this is a far cry from that. But...its far enough after that film that if you watch it for sheer fun then you can find plenty to enjoy. I'm not sure why they put Jonathan Mostow at the helm of such a potentially big entry in the franchise. He just doesn't have the proper experience. He does alright but when you consider one of the best directors of all time practically created this franchise, you can't hand it off to just anyone. The special effects are a HUGE step down and the CGI is nowhere near the standard T2 set (which is funny considering it was a dozen years later.) I'm trying very hard to hold Terminator 3 on its own and not compare it because I love this movie!! Just have fun with it and enjoy the continuing story because it works and it has a ton of action and its not nearly the mess so called ""die hard"" fans make it out to be. Its a step down but still fun. 8/10"

Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't there because for the Shakespearean soliloquies but just action scenes and cheesy one- liners, and he does those well.

"mrrockey","5","1","2","15 March 2014"," Entertaining but Soulless
","When it comes to sequels, third's not always the charm. In fact, it rarely is. For some reason, Hollywood can SOMETIMES get #2 in a series right but rarely #3. And Terminator 3 is, considered by a lot of people, not to be an exception to that rule. Fans seem to generally hate this one, calling it the first nail in the coffin for the franchise with Terminator Salvation being the next. But is it really as bad as people have claimed? Let's take a look and find out!<br/><br/>The plot takes place seven years after the second film where Sarah Connor has died of leukemia and John now lives off the grid, like a homeless bum. Even though they destroyed Cyberdyne Systems and supposedly stopped Judgment Day, John still feels unsafe and paranoid that it'll eventually come and he'll have to fight for the fate of mankind. It turns out that Judgment Day was never stopped, only postponed as two Terminators come back in time, one to assassinate John, and one to protect him.<br/><br/>I remember reading somewhere that Linda Hamilton was offered to reprise her role as Sarah Connor in this film but declined and called the script ""soulless"" and that pretty much sums up the entire film for me. While it's not as bad as a lot of sequels out there, or even that bad of a film in general, it just feels soulless and empty. Terminator 2 was really the finale of the franchise. They destroyed Cyberdyne and basically prevented Judgment Day from ever happening so there really was no need for a sequel at all.<br/><br/>Speaking of T2, this film is also severely lacking in creativity. It basically rehashes all the same plot points of T2 except without Sarah Connor, and contradicting the message in that film(more on this later). Now, you could argue that since T2 borrowed a lot from the first Terminator as well, it's not that big of a problem but the thing is, T2 developed the characters further, it expanded the universe, and it explored the themes of the first film deeper. This film doesn't do any of that, it just uses all the same concepts and ideas except now, the message of the second film about how humanity isn't doomed by fate and how we can change it, is now replaced with ""it's destiny"". It could have been an interesting concept to explore, about how humanity is destined to destroy itself someday, but it just feels like an excuse to continue the franchise and make more money in this case.<br/><br/>Okay, so I just basically tore up the film in the two last paragraphs but why don't I hate this film? Well, plain and simply, it's entertaining. While it's certainly not as thought-provoking as James Cameron's films, it still works as an action movie. The fights between the Terminators are brutal, fast-paced, and intense. There's a scene where they fight in a bathroom and they smash literally EVERYTHING in that room. It's so over-the-top, it actually becomes sort of funny at points. The pacing was fairly quick, never leaving the audience bored much and there's some decent suspense throughout(nothing compared to the first two, though). The film also LOOKS quite good. The cinematographer, Don Burgess, did a good job recreating a similar look to T2 and while the CGI isn't quite photo-realistic, it was used REASONABLY and there was a good use of both practical stunts and animatronics as well so I won't fault it too much for that.<br/><br/>The cast is just sorta hit-and-miss here. Arnold is more emotionless this time around, no longer the caring father figure to John and it works since John is no longer a kid. Nick Stahl oddly plays John whinier as an adult than Edward Furlong did as a child but nonetheless, Stahl does a good job playing a man trying to escape his own destiny. Claire Danes does OKAY as Kate Brewster, but her character was just sort of bland and uninteresting throughout to the point where her performance was ultimately forgettable. Kristanna Loken is again, sorta bland and forgettable, which is a shame considering that she's the main villain of the film. She just lacks any sort of menace and isn't in anyway intimidating throughout the entire film and it really feels like she only got cast for the sake of sex appeal.<br/><br/>Director Jonathan Mostow seems capable but he lacks the attention to detail James Cameron has and he doesn't seem to put the same level of nuance in his film. He just seems more interested in getting us to the next action scene and less interested in the human elements that made the first two films so fantastic. But the thing he seems to struggle with the most is humor. This film just goes way too far at times to the point where it feels like downright parody. Do I even HAVE to mention the part where Arnold gets his clothes from a male strip club? Thankfully, the humor gradually died down and became more subtle as the film went on.<br/><br/>Overall, if you just want a fun, brainless popcorn flick that just happens to be a Terminator film, you'll enjoy it. But if you really want something meatier and more intelligent, than you should probably look somewhere else. This is just another Hollywood cash-grab sequel. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm gonna give it a 5/10."
"Jnarup24","5","1","2","16 December 2013"," Third Time's kinda the Charm...
","This movie, in my opinion, is extremely underrated.<br/><br/>It really isn't that bad at all. I'm not saying it's the series savior, in fact I think this movie is nothing compared to T1 and T2, but I'm just saying it's okay as a whole. The action is good, it kept me entertained throughout, and that sequence in the beginning when the T-X gets in a crane truck and chases John Connor is just awesome! What I thought to be the big plot twist was in the end when the T-X reprograms the T-800 to kill John actually kept me in suspense. Overall, the action sequences throughout the movie are done very well. Again, this movie is no where near the series savior. The acting has it's up and downs. Like I said, the crane scene was great, but after that the movie becomes extremely dramatic as they drive through the desert. It gets even more dramatic when John holds up a gun to his head just because Terminator won't do what he wants. Seriously? Quote Kyle from T1; ""It can't be bargained or reasoned with"". The acting...meh. It's OK throughout. Although it becomes obvious at sometimes that certain actors don't want to be there. The plot, for what it is, is OK. In my opinion this movie should have never happened, when in T2 they stop judgment day. This is mentioned in the middle of this movie, but never even questioned again. But, we got kind of a reason for this movie, whatever, let's move on. One thing that bothers me is that the killer Terminator is in the form of a girl (by default). I'm not against girls or anything, I just think the Terminator movies have a tradition of the Terminators being in the form of a boy by default, so the T-X doesn't really lead up to the franchise. Still, I kinda like that twist. This movie is good, but I still think the story ends at T2."
"Prichards12345","6","1","2","5 May 2012"," A Journeyman Terminator Movie
","The third movie in The Terminator series came very late in the day, and while it has some explosive, well-done action scenes and the odd dose of unexpected humour (Arnie in the Elton John-style sunglasses) it's easy to see the imagination and grasp of character the first two movies had has gone.<br/><br/>It isn't a bad film taken on its own and its unexpected ending works quite well; other than that it's just a long chase movie. It's a pacey but rather soulless film, indifferently acted and with poorly conceived characters. Some tension is generated by female Terminator Kristanna Loken's first attack, but even this just descends into formula after a while. We've been here before in the earlier movies, and they did it a lot better.<br/><br/>What the film really misses is James Cameron's ultra-smart direction and sassy grasp of narrative. I'll be honest and say I don't care much for Titanic and Avatar but his two Terminator movies, Aliens, and The Abyss are much admired genre classics. Johnathon Mostow's effort, in the end, does not join them."

","This third entry in the Terminator series finishes off Arnold Schwarzenegger's involvement, and also brings the Skynet/Judgement Day story full circle. It turns out that the destruction of the Terminator chip at the end of Terminator 2 did not put Skynet off trying to terminate John Connor: nor did it stop Judgement Day, it simply delayed it.

John Conner (played here by Nick Stahl) is living a hobo-type existence off the radar. Sarah is dead from cancer, and vet Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) gets caught up in the running and trying to escape (it turns out that her involvement is very much not the accident it appears to be.<br/><br/>This film is much more of a romp than 1 and 2, with some elements definitely played for laughs (the reappearance of Earl Boen's psychiatrist Dr Silberman, for instance).

","Terminator 3: Rise of the machines is a good big-budget action.Shot in wonderful locations in and around LA,breath-taking stunts and cutting edge visual effects.But as a huge fan and admirer of the franchise,I should say I was disappointed on watching this one.<br/><br/>There are many reasons why I was disappointed on watching this one,the first being that it lacked the surreal edge that the first two films had giving you that scare as well as a fine thrill.Nick Stahl showed promise playing the role of john Connor but he had innocence written all over his face.I would have been really happy if furlong had reprised the role himself.Well,Arnie...looked way out of shape,guys who are reading this might disagree with me on this but I will elaborate it fairly..In the first two movie he was a towering 6'1-6'2 demolition man who had that grizzly killer look but here he has shrunk beyond imagination to a 5'11 and appears really odd and you can make out some sort of a difference.Plus the comical one-liners make him seem more like a clown.Even the specifics of the story have been badly altered for example,when Arnie is re-programmed by the T-X,he is about to kill Connor but Connor reminds him about his mission and that he was about to fail which gives Arnie a reminder and he shuts himself down.I found this absolute crap,because Michael biehn who brilliantly portrayed Kyle Reese in the first installment clearly stated that ""It cant be bargained with,It cant be be reasoned with!"".<br/><br/>Well the saving grace of the movie has to be without doubt,the T-X,kristanna loken beautifully played out the role and she looked just the way she had to : A crafty,censual and deadly female terminator.If there is one thing that I respect the production crew for,it would definitely be their idea of choosing a female opponent.Because it was perfect to see a female to kick some action into it.And it was amazing to see Arnie go up against a female opponent who was taller than he is and certainly looked much more deadlier than he was and it was simply amazing to see the T-X take Arnie to town and for me the best scene of the movie other than the car chase was the scene where she decapitates Arnie.<br/><br/>Well fans of this movie will definitely hate this review but as an ardent fan of the franchise I deeply felt Cameron's legacy had a much better thing in store.Its a well-made action film but not a true-blue terminator flick"
"brando647","6","1","2","14 December 2009"," Unimaginative Sequel Fails to Bring Anything New to Series...
","One of my biggest pet peeves in modern film is the creation of completely unnecessary sequels to fantastic movies. Here, we have a prime example. In my opinion, the TERMINATOR franchise would've been better off if it'd ended with the conclusion of James Cameron's TERMINATOR 2; I really wish he'd gone with his original ending showing how Judgment Day had been avoided, thereby putting a halt to future installments. Sadly, this was not the case and in 2003 Jonathan Mostow brought us the third film in the saga. The plot is nothing we haven't seen before in two other films: the future finds the human race at war with the machines (run by Skynet) and again, an attempt is made to put an end to the human resistance movement before the war ever starts. Skynet sends a new, upgraded model of Terminator to 2003 to kill John Connor, Kate Brewster (his future wife and second-in-command), and his future lieutenants. In response, the future resistance sends back another T-800 Terminator to protect him until Judgment Day passes.<br/><br/>So, essentially what we have here is TERMINATOR 2 all over again, without some of the best aspects of what made the second film so great: James Cameron's writing/direction, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, etc). The new villain, the Terminatrix, is basically a higher-tech mash-up of the first two (a weaponized endo-skeleton and a morphing liquid metal alloy) except this time it's a woman. Too much of the film feels like a rehashing of everything we've seen that most of it is forgettable until the final 30 minutes. Once Skynet goes online and Judgment Day officially arrives, the movie becomes more entertaining as we see early Hunter-Killers and T-1's rampage through a military base. The battles between the Terminators are impressive and fun to watch, but the film wanders a little too far into camp for my tastes. Some scenes, particularly the T-800's arrival in a roadside bar for ladies' night, may elicit chuckles from some but had me groaning.<br/><br/>One element that fails to live up to the first films are the performances of the cast. With the exception of Arnold Schwarzeneggar as the T-800 Terminator (he invented the role and he really can't go wrong), the cast doesn't strike the same chord. Nick Stahl does a decent job as John Connor and seems to be a suitable replacement for Edward Furlong but Claire Danes (as Kate Brewster) spends the majority of the movie freaking out and Loken (as the Terminatrix) tries to invoke the cold, soulless killer that was Robert Patrick's T-1000 but never quite has the same effect. If a third Terminator film was really necessary, I wish Mostow and the writers had gone a little further and tried to create a unique story to grab the audience's attention, rather than feeding us the same old formula (especially with the utilization of Judgment Day as a plot point, there's so much potential there). You won't be bored by TERMINATOR 3, as it's a halfway decent action movie, but fans of the franchise who were hoping for an explosive follow-up to Cameron's T2 probably won't find what they were hoping for."

","Terminator 3 (T3) often gets a bad rep but I think it's caused more by the greatness of T2 and how it was difficult if not impossible to beat. I didn't like how Skynet was still active even after the events of T2, it seemed to negate most sacrifices made by the protagonist and to slap the director James Cameron's work in the face (shades of Alien 3 here). However, without that, there wouldn't have been a T3 so I would have been quite satisfied if a simple explanation had been given. As it is, I had to check Wikipedia for that. The new director straddles a fine line between rip-offs and homages having at first trouble finding its own voice. It didn't feel as exciting and fresh as T2. The plot and directing were good but not as inspired as T2 either.<br/><br/>The terminatrix was not as good a villain as the T-1000, something was missing. Arnold was still in fine form but did look older than previous films (which is unavoidable I guess ;). The actors playing Connor and Kate Brewster were quite good. The first chase scene felt a bit overlong but you've got to admire the stunt work and I don't remember that kind of truck being used in a chase before. The film and action does pick up in the second half making it more suspenseful. I loved the fight between the Terminator and the Terminatrix when they were bashing walls. I thought that was great. I also loved the bold ending very much as it's kind of surprising while also closing the big loop hole left at the end of T2. Overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit, more in the second half than the first. It's worth renting or purchasing if you're a action sci-fi or Terminator collector.<br/><br/>Rating: 7 out of 10"
"Bjelke90","6","1","2","21 April 2009"," How such a right movie can become so wrong
","When I first read that Terminator 3 was being developed in mid February 2002 I jumped off my chair and cheered loudly. I remember the anticipation for the movie being huge. I was watching trailers, following updates here and on other sites on a weekly basis up until the release of the film. So I entered the cinema, only to see that someone in production didn't share my opinion on what a Terminator film is all about.<br/><br/>A Terminator movie to me is all about the frightening, unbelievable, yet realistic story about men creating it's own doom by making smarter and smarter computers and machines. It's about the story and adventures of Sarah Connor and John Connor. It's also about having the most hardcore villains ever in firstly Arnold Schwarzenegger and secondly Robert Patrick. In the same way that Keith Richards playing guitar in the third Pirates of the Caribbean movie the casting of a Terminatrix beating up Arnold Schwarzenegger sinks a landmine into the heart of the movie. Now, Kristanna Loken is a beautiful woman, and also good at what she's doing in this film. It's only that the role she's playing doesn't work for me. I know that her role is a superior model to Arnold's and I have to think deeper than this, but there is just no way that it looks right to me when a beautiful woman kicks Arnold Schwarzeneggers but. It's a totally wrong decision in my opinion. That was the saddest part of the movie to me.<br/><br/>And while we're at it. There's about one or two jokes in some scenes in the first two movies that never ever makes the film cross the line to being a comedic film. At parts, this movie truly is comedic and even silly. It doesn't feel like it has the right tone for a Terminator movie.<br/><br/>The casting of Nick Stahl as John Connor isn't a perfect choice either in my opinion... He's not that good of an actor and doesn't even look like Edward Furlong a few years into the future from Terminator 2. That's why I'm so glad they cast Christian Bale as Connor for the new Terminator Salvation film since he's a much better actor and looks way more like Furlong than Stahl does.<br/><br/>Now to the good parts of the movie. Apart from the to me obvious flaws of the movie that I presented it does have glimpses of classic Terminator quality. The core story, Terminatrix aside, is actually good. The Directing is good. Claire Danes is brilliant as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger. Kristanna Loken is good at playing a Terminatrix, it's just that her role is hopeless to succeed in my opinion. So that's a really double-edged sword. I don't think there's any woman that could have done it any better. The music arrangements are good and feel like a Terminator movie and so are some of the action scenes. I recommend this movie to those who likes to see big explosions and high speed chases, without thinking too much about what's really going on."

","I'm a huge Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, or at least I was. Politics aside, I've enjoyed most of his films, even if many of them were basically no-brainer, popcorn action flicks.<br/><br/>By all accounts he WAS a huge action star back in the day, but even with all the bodybuilding he did to get ready for T3, I still wasn't buying him as The Terminator I enjoyed from the first installments anymore. Everybody ages and even after most of the budget seems to have gone to pancake make-up and Oil of Olay to cover his wrinkles, I'm still unconvinced. I really, really wanted to give him a chance to reprise the role he so superbly fit back in 1984 and again in T2, but it's 19 years later. In the end, he's a 60+ year-old guy with a great build for his age.<br/><br/>As for the story; it was OK. I've certainly seen better sci-fi and action films. Did it add much to The Terminator universe? Not really. It did accomplish the feat of tying up some lose ends as to how John Connor survived the nuclear attack that is necessary for there to even be a Terminator plot line. I'm not sure that the movie could have been made without Schwarzenegger somewhere in the mix, but I guess we'll all find out when T4 opens.<br/><br/>The characters themselves were fairly cardboard and underdeveloped. Thankfully the first two movies gave some background because this one really did not help it along. I can say the the addition of a female Terminator was an interesting twist and broadened the scope of the Terminator world.<br/><br/>If you loved the first two as I did (I've seen The Terminator at least 100 times), you'll need to see T3, just don't get your hopes too high."

","Ever since the grossing success of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, fans pleaded and wished for another Terminator movie, me being one of them. Now I regret it. Terminator 3 was just junk basically. If I could sum this movie up with one word, it'd be junk. They're so many things wrong with it, the movie itself just has mind-less action, a female villain, ridiculously unfunny scenes and humor. Really, a character and series like The Terminator, never should have humor, and mind-less action mixed together because it results in a disaster. This movie felt it had to be made, like the fans couldn't see it end at Terminator 2; but we waited too long, so much has changed; it could never live up to the standards as the first two. Terminator 3 is a major disappointment, and sort of adds embarrassment and negativity to the first two movies. Terminator fans I suggest you give it a watch, just to see how much they've done to 'ruin' the series."

","Don't get me wrong, the movie was still pretty good. It just paled in comparison to the cinematic artworks that were the first two films.<br/><br/>The story was on the weak side here. A female terminator called the T-X (played by Kristanna Loken) is sent back to kill John Connor (played by a stale Nick Stahl). That's not a rip off of T2, right? And also like T2, an even further outdated T-800 (somehow called a T-850)(Arnie again also) is sent to protect him and his wife who was never mentioned before, Kate Brewster (played by a boring Claire Danes). Apparently Judgement Day wasn't stopped, making T2 completely useless.<br/><br/>The effects were good but over-used. Especially in fight scenes. Also, T-850's clothes were sort of goofy, as well as his attitude. He was just too robotic and not even in the sense that he was supposed to be. He seemed to be reading cue cards and not trying to be a robot half the time. John Connor was very weak here, as well as Kate Brewster. I hope she will be omitted from the so-called ""script"" of the upcoming Terminator 4.<br/><br/>OK, I can't stand to talk about this pathetic excuse of a Terminator movie anymore. I'm gonna go watch T1 and T2 and pray for forgiveness for even considering this movie to be in the same league as them.<br/><br/>5/10."

","It's such a pity that Hollywood seems almost incapable of realising when a franchise has run its course. So, they go on. And on.<br/><br/>Two terminators were quite enough. The first was a creepy, almost B-movie horror flick - simple, but eminently well presented. 'Judgement Day' on the other hand, was a truly epic work of science fantasy. Between the two they used up all of the ideas associated with the concept. There was nothing else to play for. So why then not finish on a high note? <br/><br/>Because there's still money in it; that's why. Like prospectors mining gold, they just can't accept that the vein has run out.<br/><br/>OK, what else can we do that's new? I know; how about a female terminator? We can always build a story round that. Yes. Actually, the T1000 of 'Judgement Day' was itself capable of completely mimicking any human females it killed, so what was the point of a dedicated design? I won't go on. Objective critics have seen all of the movie's shortcomings. Only nerds sat back and gaped in awe at this one.<br/><br/>Yes; the new effects were excellent. The tanks that had a hint of 'Robocop' about them were highly believable hokum, as were the flying machines. But we'd seen them all before, just fewer in number. The acting was plausible but hardly set the screen on fire. Arnie actually looked bored in this outing, which is something of an acting revelation for him. And the script was - well - cheesy.<br/><br/>Judgement Day it transpires was, after all, unavoidable. It took an extra two hours of repetitive, rehashed celluloid mayhem of slaughter, truck-chases, and shattering glass to tell us that? <br/><br/>I don't think so.<br/><br/>Watching inadequate sequels to favourite movies is rather like seeing old friends dying from some wasting illness."

"hasosch","7","1","2","24 December 2007"," Transputing Terminators
","Since the 1930ies, Science fiction, the ""genuine American fairytale"" (Gotthard Günther), has anticipated a world determined by computers. The about six generations of computers built since Zuse share that they are unable to deal with circularity, i.e. self-reference, re-entry, autopoiesis, etc., because they are constructed according to classical logic which does not allow, e.g., a statement like ""I am lying"", since this statement is true when I am lying and false when I am not lying, i.e. it is true when it is false and false when it is true. On similar reasons, comments about sentences are excluded, e.g. ""This sentence is true/false"". When we hear now, in ""Terminator 3"" (2003), a sentence like ""My command is to protect you"" or even stronger: ""Get away from me ... I have no choice ... I cannot control my functions ... I am a machine"", then it is clear that in the case of terminators, we have to deal with a trans-classic logic and hence not with simple computers but with ""trans-puters"", i.e. with computers that allow self-reference because the logical law of the Excluded Middle is abolished.<br/><br/>From the above quotation it is also clear that when a machine says ""I have no choice ... I am a machine"", it is self-aware on what it is, i.e. it has its own will. Its third logical value besides position and negation after the abolishment of the Law of the Excluded Middle allows this kind of machine to realize the difference between its program and its intent to react appropriately in a certain situation. Not even the newest computers can realize that, since they follow a logic in which the Law of the Excluded Middle is still valid. Here we also find the profoundest reason why terminators are that human-like (and, conversely, why they like to appear in human-like shape and sometimes lead to ""hermaphroditic"" creatures like ""cyborgs"", ""androids"" and others): Control of will is hitherto still a feature by which humans are differentiated from machines. If we now watch terminators, we see that trans-puters presuppose formalization not only of cognition (like classical computers do), but also of volition. But formalization of volition would imply that from a certain point on the computer would transgress its constructor. There would not be anymore, as in classical computers, a symbiosis between constructor and construction.<br/><br/>Such ""poly-contextural"" computers (a term introduced by G. Günther during his work at the ""Biological Computer Laboratory"" of the University of Illinois) with both formalized cognition and volition would fulfill Norbert Wiener's claim for Golem-like ""human-machines"" uttered in his book ""The Human Use of Human Beings"" (1950). However, from a general point of view it is strange that cybernetics, which was established as a science since the Macy conferences in New York (starting in 1946) and is nowadays practically extinct in the academic world, seems to survive in Science Fiction which, in its turn, is anticipating future computer generations. But since ""control"" is a core-term of cybernetics, this science may perhaps become revitalized in times where whole continents are menaced by terrorism. If this is true, one should, however, not forget that total control must not only concern the reign of cognition but most utterly the empire of the will, too. Since this must not be done as in the case of Dr. Mabuse whose aim was simply to replace the will of humans by his own, but in allowing a machine to have its OWN will, the concept of formalization of volition only will imply both control and freedom."
"DavidSim240183","5","1","2","12 November 2007"," The flawless Terminator series finally hits a snag
","James Cameron's Terminator films are classics. The original was an exciting, pulse pounding adventure. A gritty SF film with a sharp edge. Then with Terminator 2, he took the framework of Pt 1, and expanded it out into an epic-sized masterpiece. We've had to wait 12 years for a third instalment. But without Cameron in the director's chair, this has had a domino effect.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is not all bad but its a major disappointment after what we've seen beforehand. This time the director is Jonathan Mostow. And he doesn't have the intense style Cameron brings to his action films.<br/><br/>In spite of his over-sized ego, James Cameron is an excellent action film director. His films always have an exhilarating kick. Mostow on the other hand merely 'borrows' from Cameron. If the setpieces in T3 feel eerily familiar, that's because you've seen them in the other Terminator films.<br/><br/>T3 is not a direct rehash of Pts 1 & 2. It has got a slightly different plot. But at its heart, its about the same thing. Two Terminators from the future are sent into the past. And their objective concerns John Connor. One to protect him. One to kill him.<br/><br/>Aside from Arnold Schwarzenegger, the thread of the Terminator trilogy has always been John Connor. He was a target before he was even born. Then when he was a child. And now as a young man. Gone is the surly Edward Furlong. Now in the role is Nick Stahl.<br/><br/>This was the first film I'd ever seen Stahl in. And to say he's disappointing is putting it politely. It's hard to believe this is the person Edward Furlong would grow up to be, and someone who will go on to be the leader of the human resistance, much less the saviour of the human race. Stahl is a positively wimpy John Connor. It's all the more surprising especially after seeing what a good actor Stahl is in films like Sin City and the underrated Disturbing Behaviour.<br/><br/>T3 has slightly adjusted the plot for this latest instalment. But not by much. John Connor is again targeted for termination. But he's not alone. His future lieutenants are also on the chopping block. One of them is also his future wife, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), a humble vet who gets roped into Skynet's latest assassination plan.<br/><br/>As for the Terminators, Arnie is present and correct. But the newest addition, and the one spark of originality the film has is a female Terminator, the T-X (Kristanna Loken).<br/><br/>Loken is sexy as hell in red leather, but she's disappointing too. She never generates a threatening presence the way Arnie or Robert Patrick did. She's supposed to be emotionless, but she's just too emotional in her inflections. She even smiles. And when she does downplay her emotions, she's just bland.<br/><br/>Claire Danes isn't much better as Kate. I suspect she's Linda Hamilton's replacement. Nick Stahl almost says as much when he compares her to his mother. This is untrue. Hamilton had a startling presence in T2. She was always believable when packing a rifle. Danes struggles to make the part her own, and ends up buried in the A-list action sequences and special effects.<br/><br/>The film's one ace in the hole is Arnie. At least he comes off with a degree of respectability. The Terminator is a role Arnie could do in his sleep. But thankfully he doesn't sleepwalk through the role. His cold, detached observations are surprisingly funny. Like Pt 2, he's been reprogrammed as a good Terminator, but interestingly, he's allowed some ambiguities. Things he was never allowed in the previous films.<br/><br/>Although he's John's protector, he doesn't have to follow his orders. He can outright refuse if he wants. He is even capable of lying. Those are moments pleasantly reminiscent of his acting in Pt 1. Which made me realise how much I missed him being an evil Terminator. Arnie's OK as a good Terminator, but he's great when he's bad!<br/><br/>At least the special effects are up to scratch. Most of them involve the T-X. She can form guns, revert to liquid, and even control machinery. As well as effect a few improvements in the chest area! But impressive as these effects may be, they don't come with the awe the T-1000 had when he assumed the pattern of a tile floor. Or gathering his shattered bits into a puddle and reassuming human form. The T-X is technically proficient, but she's curiously unremarkable.<br/><br/>The action scenes are on a par with the previous films, but they don't feel as thrilling. The most spectacular is a high speed chase involving an artificial crane, remote controlled police cars, and LA's rush hour traffic. But the action doesn't enthrall you. It's mindless, crash-bang-wallop chaos. You somehow distance yourself from the action on display. It never grabs you by the throat the way James Cameron's action sequences did.<br/><br/>One thing that is different about T3 is the fact that the war against the machines is about to begin, hence the title. There are a few nifty scenes involving the first wave of Skynet's robotic legions, including robots that stalk the corridors while searching out their prey. And I did like the way the film doesn't wimp out on us. The war begins in earnest, even if it never shows the devastation of our world being destroyed, making way for the terror that's to come.<br/><br/>But still, Terminator 3 never really flies. There are nice ideas here and there, like the T-X trying to deprogram the reprogrammed Terminator, but T3 is very underwhelming. James Cameron's absence had more of an effect than I thought it would. When Mostow tries to emulate Cameron, the results are just embarrassing. A shame this once great series seems to have run dry. Let's hope the next instalment is an improvement."

It has nice action scenes (even though at least one of them is a bit over-length), and the lovable humour unique to the terminator series is present. It's a great movie well worth the franchise."

","**possible spoilers contained** Terminator 3 was roundly slammed by critics and fans alike, but having waited 12 years for it, I was prepared to enjoy it no matter what, and was actually pleased with the results.<br/><br/>It's been 10 years since the events of Terminator 2 and John Connor has managed to avoid any traceable records, living ""off the grid."" When the new Terminator, a femme fatale played by Kristanna Loken arrives and kills off some of his schoolmates, it's up to JC (get it?) to save humanity, with the help of Good-Guy Terminator Arnie, and Claire Danes as former girlfriend/future wife. Violent Oedipal imagery abounds, when we find out the empty ""womb""/tomb of his mother, MIA Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), contains some heavy artillery. The film, which is basically a chase movie like the first two, ends on a down note. Where T-1 and T-2 were hopeful about the fate of humans, the final installment lets us know that we'll all be responsible for our destruction.<br/><br/>While not nearly up to the standards of special effects and intelligent narrative set by the first two movies, T-3 was a cut above most bonehead action flicks, and it still manages to make the audience think. It certainly missed both James Cameron and Linda Hamilton (whose ignoble death was not befitting the mother/Amazon we loved from T-2: ""There are 206 bones in the human body. That was one.""). I'll continue to love the series, because it's compelling and smart without losing the action, and I look forward to the next one. I'll bet Arnie won't be required, since digital imagery has come a long way. We'll see."

","T3 is a very well made movie with amazing action and awesome special effects. It had very big shoes to fill and in my opinion Mostow delivered a good (not great) film. Sure, it could have been much better but it also could have been much worse. <br/><br/>The TX is excellent. Kristanna Loken does an impressive job. She's not as scary as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2, but she still delivers. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are alright. It's great to see Arnold as the Terminator again! Although he messes up a few lines, it does not hurt the film.<br/><br/>The problem i do have with the film is the comedy. Sure, some jokes might be funny, but it's not at the right place in a Terminator film. The movie should have been darker and more serious.<br/><br/>One other thing that bugged me was mistake they made about John's age. In T2 John is 10 years old. But at the opening of T3, John says he was 13 during the events of T2. I cant imagine them making a mistake like that. <br/><br/>Overall, T3 is a solid entry in the franchise and i highly recommend it to action-fanatics.<br/><br/>8/10"
"ueykgqbmsjlxtf","4","1","2","17 January 2007"," A Total Failure
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is, quite frankly, a failure.<br/><br/>Let us start with the inferior special effects: Given that the film cost 187 million dollars to make, one would expect superior quality special effects, or, at least, high quality. However, it was not delivered.<br/><br/>A terminator exists for one purpose: to kill. It is relentless, brutal, and every feature of its design is meant to facilitate more efficient killing. As a special effects artist, one should create imagery that captures this idea... So.. my question is... how exactly will those glowing lights help a terminator kill??? both terminators have an EXCESSIVE amount of glowing, Christmas-tree like features. the T-101 has red and green lights inside its chest, and the T-X is practically a walking blue LED. It reminds one of geeky PC with UV lights rather than a killing machine.<br/><br/>we will also note that the T-X comes with tiny a rotary saw!! i mean, come on!! the giant stabbing sword of t-1000 provided a much better visual representation of brutality. Big, sharp, pointy objects looks menacing, blurry round things doesn't, especially when it's about 2 inches in diameter and comes with the sound FX of a dentist's drill.<br/><br/>the physics is horrible as well, in the hand-to-hand combat scene, the T-X manage to throw T-101 for 10 meters without moving back an inch. And no, it doesn't make T-X look strong, it makes the entire scene look artificial, like a bad kung-fu movie. There is also a scene where the T-101 pulls open the door of a safe: not only is that physically impossible (if it were a real safe one most most likely pull the entire safe out of the wall) but the scene also fails to convey the message that the terminator is strong. To covey strength visually, one need to establish visually that 1) something is difficult to do and 2) the character does this difficult thing, so he/she is strong. Throughout the film the terminators perform feats of strength way too effortlessly, which takes away the realism. (in comparison, Robert Patrick's hand to hand fight scene in T2 was much much better.<br/><br/>There are two more scenes that bugs me visually. One is the scene where T-X sends electric signals to police cars. the computer generated graphics looks like something from the 1980's. the other scene is where cathrine bruster shot T-101 and T-101 spits out the bullet. If i had designed that scene i would have had the bullet tear off a large chunk of T-101's cheek, making a wound that looks like a menacing grin while revealing its metal mandible, or better yet, tear off a piece of T-101's eye.. or, at the very least, show some blood... but nooo.. the T-101, simply catches the bullet with its mouth.. like.. some parlor trick... sigh..<br/><br/>Aside from the special effects problem, there are script problem as well.. ill place humor is a huge problem in this movie.<br/><br/>T-101 saying ""talk to the hand"" is just not funny.<br/><br/>T-101 wearing star shaped sun-glasses.. not funny either...<br/><br/>T-101 saying ""excuse me"" to T-X: not funny.<br/><br/>cathrine bruster punching T-101 in back the same way that most girls punch guys when they are flirting with them: what is this: a romantic comedy? T-X saying ""i like your car"" ""i like your gun""... just plain weird.<br/><br/>T-X breast enlargement: serves no purpose. (she was gonna kill the cop anyway, not like there is a NEED for deception and doing things for no apparent purpose destroy the whole image of the Sparthan, cold blooded killing machine.) T-X always walking like she was on a catwalk.. neither funny, nor sexy, nor cool, nor menacing.<br/><br/>T-X having a strange curious look before using her remote control ability: just plain weird to see cold blooded killing machine with the look of curiosity! In short.. the film sucks..."
"MinorityReporter","5","1","2","15 January 2007"," One of the worst action movies of the decade!
","My first question in regards to reviewing this movie is 'why'. Why did they decide to continue a story that had been finished? Why did they not get James Cameron to direct? Why, why, why? Obviously the answer is money. They wanted to use a formula which generated big box office, which it did. Unfortunately this movie completely shattered the point of the previous movies, which is very hard to do. Usually when I talk about the terminator series I casually ignore this third installment about which is hard to say anything flattering.<br/><br/>First of all following in the footsteps of James Cameron is a hard thing to do. After all Cameron wrote and directed the first two installments in the franchise and did a wonderful job. He created two of the best action movies I have ever seen. In comes Jonathan Mostow who has but a fraction of Cameron's talent. To be fair there isn't a lot Mostow can do with the material he is given. The script seems rushed and casually ignores what made the previous movies so successful. Why the heck wasn't Linda Hamilton brought back. Her character should be treated with more respect than this. Once again the movie never should have left the drawing board.<br/><br/>Acting wise the film has taken a huge step down. Schwarzenegger received an enormous pay check to return in this second sequel and you feel the lack of interest from his part. His performance is the least of my concerns regarding the acting, however, and Schwarzenegger gives a decent performance as he still has the stiffness and commanding presence required to be the terminator. Nick Stahl is brought in to play John Connor and while not my primary point of critique he is still frightfully dull. I don't understand why they didn't just let Edward Furlong reprise the role. Claire Danes is equally dull and much of her acting seems forced and unbelievable. Stahl's and Danes' chemistry in the scenes where they bond is pretty stale and lifeless. You don't feel the tension there was between Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. My primary point of critique is in the choice of villain. Kristianna Loken's villain, T-X, has none of the menace that T-1000 had or that Arnold had in the first film. It's hard to get too excited in the showdowns between her and the protagonists, sadly.<br/><br/>Effects wise the movie has also taken a step down. Obviously the effects are more complex but they have lost their edge. While the effects were impressive they were outmatched this year (2003) by The Matrix sequels and The Return of the King. Terminator has in one stroke been reduced to second fiddle and provides only adequate CGI. One misses the ingenuity of the effects revolving around the T-1000. Once again, what a shame.<br/><br/>All in all Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a massive disappointment and the series really deserved more respect than this piece of garbage. One of the worst movies of the year and definitely one of the worst action movies of the decade.<br/><br/>3/10"

This is a fun, action packed film, but it doesn't live up to the first two.<br/><br/>James Cameron is no longer the director, which is the film's first problem. Next, the style is too different. A lot of comic relief was put into the script, and at some points it was highly unnecessary. The story in this movie only manages to confuse anybody that was paying attention to the second film. There are too many questions that go unanswered at the end of this movie. What I did like about this movie was that it finally showed us how the war started, and that was really cool to see. I also liked all the references that were made to the second film, like when John Connor asks the terminator if he remembers ""hasta la vista, baby."" Some of the humorous parts got a good laugh out of me, but it just got to be too much at some parts.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good. Arnold played the role that he created perfectly.

This was written by Cameron wasn't it? Did he decide that this was going to be comedy instead of sci/fi action. Or where those lines added behind his back by the diector? I have a feeling that they were suggested by Arnold during the shooting and that Mostow is such a pansy that he didn't stand up and refuse to have those ridiculous lines in the movie. Don't get me wrong I love Arnold but I have seen interviews where he attempts to be funny and they turn out surprisingly similar to the chessy feeling of T3."

"jamesrovira","6","1","2","29 January 2006"," Good, but not good enough
","It's a good, entertaining film for fans of the previous two Terminator films, but it doesn't make enough of an effort, so ends the series on an anticlimactic note. For example, the new Terminator of the second film was a dramatic improvement over the Terminator of the first, while the villain machine of T3 is the same as the previous one with the exception of being a female machine that accessorizes.<br/><br/>The adult John Connor has less juevos than even Claire Danes' character, who surprisingly impresses in this film as she does in all her work. I didn't expect her to do well in an action film and she demonstrated herself to be capable of some of the moxie of a Uma Thurman or Angelina Jolie. I hope she makes more action films. Unfortunately, in this film the action sequences make no attempt to go beyond anything accomplished in the previous two films. There is one exceptional car chase scene that rivals the freeway chase scene of the Matrix trilogy, but this expected device is the film's highlight.<br/><br/>The film departs philosophically from the previous two: human victories were previously believed to create an open ended future. This film, in contrast, ends on a fatalist note; the future is determined and our only responsibility is to survive. For this reason this is possibly the last film in the series; all that is left is to depict the human/machine war after Judgment Day or the future they build after beating the machines."

","My next comment will get all James Cameron fans angry, but then again that is entirely their problem. I liked T3 better than T2.<br/><br/>Sure, there are plot holes in T3 where you could drive a truck through, in fact I think they do in couple of occasions, but the bottom line is, that I was entertained more by this film than I was by T2. The main reason is, that I've never been found of Edward Furlong in the role of John Connor. I thought he was a bit annoying character in T2. In T3 John (Nick Stahl) is still a bit whiny, but he wasn't as annoying.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton didn't return, which was a bit shame, but luckily the movie works without her. Claire Danes substitutes as a female hero, Kate Brewster, who resembles Hamiltons original role from T1 as a woman who doesn't first believe, but soon gets the situation.<br/><br/>Arnold is back of course, as a protector as in the T2, but now he has more attitude and his role is actually a lot better than it was in T2, at least I liked him more as a ""don't mess with me"" kind of a robot.<br/><br/>Kristianna Loken is more modified liquid circuit Lisa, who this time is able to generate weapons out of her limbs, as in energy guns, flame thrower and such.<br/><br/>T3 is nonstop action from the beginning to the end. The pseudo philosophical aspects of two previous Cameron films have been dropped almost completely and the action scenes have grown bigger and more showing. There are couple of hilarious action scenes as well and Arnold's Terminator is a bit more comical, but not too much.<br/><br/>As said, the movie has a couple of scenes which could have used more plot, but overall pros win over the cons.

"ruibento","3","1","2","6 September 2005"," Terminator 3 - the machines do rise, but the movie lets down
","Responsible for James Cameron's career boost, back in 1984, was the dark action-meets-horror ""The Terminator"". More than another thriller, this was a mark on the history of cinema, not only for its special effects and action sequences, but for its innovator story and plot. The idea of a terminator that came back from the future to murder the mother of a boy who would become the leader of human resistance in a few decades caught everyone attention. Seven years later, James Cameron did what most directors are unable to: the sequel to ""The Terminator"", named ""Terminator 2: The Judgement Day"", surpassed the first film. With the intelligent twist of turning the first film's villain into the second one's hero, along with the introduction of the teenager John Connor and the ultimate villain T-1000, drove this film to the top, making it one of the best action / science-fiction pictures of all times.<br/><br/>Because of all of this mystic surrounding the Terminator series, I was ecstatic with the announcement of the release of a sequel to the series, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"". Eventually, my expectations lowered a little when I knew James Cameron wouldn't be involved in it, although John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris (responsible for David Fincher's underrated ""The Game"") and Jonathan Mostow would be directing it.<br/><br/>Ten years after Terminator 2, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) died of leukemia and John Connor (Edward Fulrong / Nick Stahl) became a recluse, always isolated from society. This introduces the new chapter in the Terminator series. This time, the T-850 Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) travels back in time to protect not only John Connor, but also a woman whose name is Katherine Brewster (Claire Danes) from another enemy: the terminatrix T-X (Kristanna Loken). But who was this Brewster character and why would the T-850 want to protect her? The answer is simple: she was going to marry John Connor and have children with him. Together, they would lead the human resistance against the machines in a not-so-distant future.<br/><br/>Unfortunantely, it's when the existence of the terminators is justified by the authors that the plot reaches mediocrity. The excuse found for the return of the terminators is no other than fatality, the inevitability of destiny. Besides bringing up a lot of philosophical issues, this «plot twist» makes us think that all the efforts of Sarah, John and the T-800 to destroy the Cyberdyne building were completely and utterly useless. And it also makes ""destiny"" a fact and not an open discussion (like the existence of God, for that matter): Terminators were meant to exist and there's nothing anyone or anything can do to stop it, it's just fate. A poor excuse, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The key-character, the T-850 (and not the T-800 as in the previous two films) is also a little disappointing. Why? After becoming a complex and almost touching character in Terminator 2, with a great chemistry between him and John Connor, the Terminator is little more than a machine and there's not the least sign of a relation between him John. This fits the plot created for this film, but it takes out something that was fundamental for the success of ""Judgement Day"". The only point where the authors tried to add a little humanity to the machine was when he had to face the duel between what he was programmed to do and what he «should» to: the results was terrible. At the same time, it's undeniable that Schwarzenegger's performance did put a lot of charisma into the character and it was very good to see him playing the Terminator once more. It's very hard to believe that Arnold is in his 50's, due to his great physical shape. On the other hand, the terminatrix T-X causes very little impact, despite her great attributes as a killing machine (the arms that become lethal weapons, the ability to connect to the internet and doing DNA exams in the blink of an eye, etc). It's impossible not to compare Loken's T-X to Richard Patrick's T-1000 and the second one is a clear winner. The T-1000 was a much more menacing character than the T-X and this is probably not just because of the actors, but because of the atmosphere of this film: it seems to be shot in daylight all the time, meaning that it does not have that dark side that were obvious in the other two films and were part of their greatness - the two first Terminators were thrillers and this is absolutely just an action movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, despite the poor story and plot schemes, Mostow tries to draw the attentions off the plot and on the spectacular action sequences. And this is where the film's strength resides, even though the action reaches its climax early in the film. In conclusion, the third film of the Terminator saga is a close cousin to Terminator 2, since exploits the same theme of the good terminator who travels back in time to protect John Connor (and, this time, Kate Brewster) and the bad terminator who tries to do the opposite. Unfortunately, I have to admit that this was a disappointment, mostly because of its weak story and plot, but also because of the film's atmosphere (not dark at all and doesn't make you sit on the edge of your seat like the first two films did) and the lack of charisma of both John Connor (not because of Stahl's acting, but because of what Connor grows up to be; nevertheless, I would definitely like to see Edward Fulrong playing John Connor once more - after all, it was his character) and T-X. In my opinion, the emotional appeal of the terminator series along with the action sequences rescue the movie from complete failure."

I know it's devoid James Cameron and some feel that this film lacked his vision and leadership. But somehow, I feel that Cameron has lost his ability to tell a story without a $100+ Million dollar budget. I like this story because it relies on and clings to the original premise unlike the second film. To me, T2 was all about eye candy and had very little to do with story. T3 returns to the gritty hard-core reality of a post-nuke world at war against SkyNet and the machines. I get chills at the end. I also love the return of the Love Story element. The first film is a love story as much as it is an action film. THat element was totally lost in T2. Congrats to the producers and all for returning the franchise to its roots."

","When seeing the trailer the first time I was astonished, it really gave me this wow feeling, and I was looking forward to see the movie. But after seeing the movie I felt betrayed, betrayed form the big Hollywood studio. And again, they showed only the best scenes from the movie. Ohh, no, not the best scenes, only the best key frames from action overloaded scenes.<br/><br/>The runtime is too short, not even 2 hours of action was presented to the public. After the 2hour and 22 minutes of Terminator 2 I thought this third part, where the end of the world starts, will be as at least 2 hours long. Because of this lack of time the story is told a bit too fast. One action scene is right after the previous one, there is no time to think about the seen, no time to cross-link the first two parts with this third one. The talks of John Connor, where he explains where he was and what he was/is doing, well the story tellings, is simply flat, dry and monotone. Yeah, I could say it's boring. You get the info you have to know but it seems that there is no feeling behind that, it doesn't give the feeling that John is the"" man of the future, the one and only. . .<br/><br/>The effects, some are realistic, some are not, even Terminator 2 from 1991 has more realistic effects than this one. I'm talking here especially about the cemetery scene where T-X flies on this gravestone. How the stone brakes and the dust this little accident makes is absolutely fake and this fake is visible, even from miles away. The car chaise, it's fine, but hell, did the this scene where all those buildings got demolished really cost 25$ millions.<br/><br/>The cemetery scene with Kate, the doc and the police . . . well it's to boring. Kate being at the SWAT truck, talking to the doc, being very excites, under shock, talking nonsense, the doc offers her some chill pill ( something to calm her down ), Kate takes the pill, hold it in her hands, in the other hand some water and starts telling the doc what's up. Then she mentions the name John and some huge, and the doc asks who this John is. Kate says, John, John Connor, an old schoolmate"" and then the doc goes blank. You men John Connor, son of Sarah Connor""  Yes""  And this huge guy, and here comes the description of Arnie, calls himself a Terminator""  Yes, but how do you know that"" . . . and then you hear some explosions and machine guns firing. The doc turns around and sees the Terminator . . . doc shows his wondering face and says No, not again"", takes the pill away from Kate, drinks it . . . takes another pill(s) from drinks them and then runs away. . . Kate runs after him wondering how the doc knows this bullet eating giant and tells Kate the past contacts with this Terminatora and this is where Kate should realize that it's true what John was talking about . . . this small scene, told slowly, and wisely could have made the movie a bit longer and brought some break before the next big block of explosions and fight scenes To the ARMY, well the general and co at this Computer Defense center or whatever it is act like the generals from the movies Under Siege 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The scene where T-man is reprogrammed to kill John and John is telling him not to do it, the inner fight that the Terminator has, is simply childish and very predictable. It is somehow the low, not Terminator like.<br/><br/>It's also funny how two people in their mid 20's can escape from human killing machines, but the well trained, educated military people are killed within a few seconds. I thought in such high security facilities only the best of the best can be the guards. O.K., a lot of computer programmers, scientists and engineers are working there, but it's simply stupid that they get killed.<br/><br/>It seems like Jonathan Mostow used the analogy, the time-line, the art of T2 and tried to copy it to the new is story. Tried to make the same things but really failed."

","I loved the first 2 films and I was very excited about the possibility of a T3. After T2 I figureed things were over. When I heard the rumors of a T3, I wondered how it could be possible after the way T2 ended. Was there another chip, was there something left at the metal plant, etc. I was curious to see why. So I was understandably shaken when the premise for the whole film was summed up in 1 line. I felt like getting up and walking out at that point. There was no real tension, not much terror and how scary is it to have a supermodel chase around a dude, his future wife and a robot? . I think the franchise should have ended after T2 and this was an obvious attempt for Arnold to get 1 last great payday before going into politics full time."
"Corky1984","Null","1","2","22 April 2005"," Should have been better
","This is another of those films that promised the world, but didn't deliver. Granted, its not bad, but it should have been so much better. The story and acting are all generally fine, but what is lacking is the biting violence of the first movie, and to a lesser degree T2. By going for a 12A rating, the team behind this accepted that it would have to be very tame so little kids wouldn't be scared. That is where it goes wrong. This film should have been an 18 without question. The action scenes are quite entertaining, but they never go far enough, and there is a scandalous lack of gore for a film claiming to be from the action genre. T3 summarises what is wrong with so many of today's films, they are antiseptic, pale imitations of their 80s forebears. Had this film been made in say, 1988, I have no doubt that whilst the special effects would have been much worse, the film overall would have been vastly more action packed. Arnie is on top form as the Terminator and the support stars are all fine, but when you look back at T1 and T2 you realise that this is not in the same league. Arnie should also have been in this film more often, that he wasn't detracts from the film. A missed opportunity."
"DrLex","6","1","2","30 March 2005"," Redundant
","I watched this movie, knowing that after T2 the only possibility to make a sequel would be to break with the existing storyline somehow and come up with something as 'Hollywood-plausible' as the trick used to justify ""Alien: resurrection"". So I expected nothing more than an action movie, probably combining elements from the two previous movies, using more special effects, more spectacular explosions, and contemporarily adding the obligatory woman beating up men. And I was kind of right. The one-liners were there, the spectacular chases, the CGI effects, the explosions, and a female terminator sowing death and destruction and grabbing Arnie in the crotch. <br/><br/>*WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW!* <br/><br/>I won't go into detail about all the holes in the plot, because this has been done in countless reviews before. Something I haven't read during a sampling of the thousands of reviews, is that at the end, Connor says something like the Terminator has tricked them into the nuclear shelter. This would fit with the dialog right after the chase in the funeral car, when the Terminator at first didn't seem to want to change its objective of leading Connor and Brewster to a safe place in Mexico. Maybe it knew about the Crystal Peak shelter and tricked them into believing they could take out Skynet, but actually lead them to that shelter. However, the only reason why they went there, is that Brewster's dad said the Skynet mainframe is located there. Or maybe I was so confused about all the other plot holes that I got this wrong, whatever. <br/><br/>One thing I don't understand about many of the reviews here is that people find it so obvious that this movie ought to have a T4 sequel. Maybe they didn't catch Arnie's last phrase ""We'll meet again"" which IMHO only refers to the fact that Connor will be killed by this very terminator in the future, as explained during the conversation in the van. Actually I believe this movie has literally blown up every chance for an interesting sequel which still has something in common with the Terminator movies as we know them. The earth is nuked, which only leaves an opportunity to make a movie which is one long battle scene in a post-apocalyptic world, the kind we saw a few of in the first two movies as flash-forwards - or flash-backs if you want. In other words, this would be something like Mad Max but then with dimmed lights and robots, which are so numerous and strong that it'll require loads of 'Hollywood-plausibility' to avoid the only real plausible outcome, being the eradication of humanity. There is no room for anything of the stuff that made the first movies interesting. But apparently, many people want to see robots beating the crap out of humans during two hours until they are all dead. Well, I don't. Not even Cameron would be able to make an interesting movie out of that. <br/><br/>Overall, I found this a redundant addition to the two existing excellent movies. It didn't work as a sequel, nor as a tribute, nor as a parody, only as an action movie to pass the time on an otherwise boring evening."

","While I had been hoping that James Cameron would be back to repeat his fine work with the 'Terminator' series, I was not disappointed with Jonathan Mostow's version of the latest installation. The only thing I would have added was the start of the future war - in the post-nuclear-attack world, where the human resistance starts to fight the horrifying machines of Skynet.<br/><br/>In this latest addition to the Terminator series, the CSM-101 (Schwarznegger) returns again to protect John Connor (Stahl) - now invisible & untraceable - from Skynet's latest assassin droid, the T-X (Loken), a frightening machine with multiple onboard weapons and the ability to control other machines from a distance. Additionally, Skynet has already begun its stealthy takeover of computer systems, in the guise of a computer virus. In a series of frightening and near-lethal encounters, John meets up with his future wife and co-leader in the resistance, Kate Brewster (Danes). With the T-X unable to locate John, she starts by going after future prominent figures in the resistance, one of whom is Kate's dad, an Air Force General in charge of Cyber Research Systems - which includes Skynet. They also discover that it is too late to stop Skynet from starting the horrible nuclear war that is the prelude to the war between Skynet's machines and the human resistance. However, they decide to try to at least protect General Brewster from the T-X, as the Terminator reveals he is an important resistance figure - making him a main target of Skynet's assassin droid. When they reach CRS, they discover that General Brewster's bosses in the Pentagon have lost all control of their military, courtesy of the Skynet virus that has cut them off. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has ordered Kate's dad to uplink Skynet in the hopes of killing the virus. Despite Brewster's reluctance to do so, he complies - and Skynet takes control of ALL the U.S. military, including the nuclear subs and missile silos! The T-X appears and guns down General Brewster, but he escapes along with John & the others to his office, where he warns Kate & John to head to Crystal Peak - supposedly the system core of Skynet. John & Kate escape to the hardened facility and enter, aided by clearance codes carried by Kate's dad. After a narrow escape from the T-X, in which she meets an ugly end, they descend several hundred feet into the mountain to discover it is nothing more than a command center for General Staff and VIPs. The President, Congress, Cabinet and Joint Chiefs never got the warning, however, and John & Kate are alone in the structure. Seconds later, alerts pour in from all over the country, as Skynet launches the USAF's ICBMs against targets in Russia & China. In a frightening end sequence, missile trails criss-cross the sky as Russia & China launch their counterattacks, and all over the world nuclear mushroom clouds erupt. Judgment Day has come - and soon, the war against the machines will begin.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of an 'opening' sequence about the future war, it still leaves open great potential for a Terminator 4. The characters of the future war are introduced to us in a way that makes them believable and real. It will be interesting to see how the CSM-101 Terminators figure in the future war - we are given some hint of this in future war sequences that show huge platoons of CSM-101s deploying from Skynet bombers against the human resistance. Bring on Terminator 4!"

","T2 was just a snotty family movie, but you must admit it was a high-quality snotty family movie. If somebody wanted to defile everything with a gloomy hopeless secondary concocted thing (and nobody had any doubt that it would be a gloomy hopeless secondary concocted thing), they could at least try and make a high-quality one. And what did we see? We are absolutely lost in time-travel and alternative universes. That's very good. If we were not lost, we would clearly see how stupid all this stuff is. I will kill you in the future, because you will trust me after the story that was in the second film. All right. I'd like to see how he trusted him after he had told him (in the third film) that he would kill him. Or was it in one more alternative universe? Naturally, it was, in that universe all these young people had not been killed. And what will he do without them? Down with them, it's his problem, there's no fate, but he is doomed to save the humanity, so don't be afraid, he will save it! Schwarzenegger. We all know, that all his heroes are in fact one and the same hero, and he has only two ways in this situation: self-parody and self-plagiarism, and while the first is fun, the second is annoying. Now we see that he invited the third way: plagiarizing parody. Who needed it? Not me. It was just another way to make a connection with T2, and it didn't work, because it is a different film in a different era. Then, it is just badly done. Yes, they crashed much more cars, but why the chases in the first two films are as much more thrilling as less cars were broken there? They could just have rolled all those cars off a cliff without shooting it - with the same use, maybe, even with more use, because they would at least have had fun themselves. So many details that don't fit each other, the first two films and the reality, that it would be an even longer post if I tried to recall all of them. I still hope some of them are just a problem of the translation, but the other cannot be. Why such crude work? You probably remember that moment it T2, where a song begins with a new scene, ""Bad to the bones"" or something like that. What we find in this film? Another song, switched on in a somehow similar frame. But that one was as organic as a fragment of a song in the middle of a movie can be, and this one just strikes eardrums with no sense. All this ""primary weapons"", broken lavatory pans, fragile flying machines, mysterious blinking stands... It resembles a cheesy shooter video game much more than a film. Maybe, it was their primary target: to make a film easily transforming into a video game. But I am not going to play this game, neither I want to see the film many times."

","T1 was great, T2 a worthy sequel but T3.....? I don't know where to start, is it the non-existing plot, the bad acting or the ignorance of details which I disliked most? There are so many senseless moments that I just name a few of them: There is a scene where the T-X is lying on the roof of a car with her target John Conor sitting inside. As we see in almost every scene the pure strength and power of T-X is incredible, so what should be easier than simply destroying the roof and killing John Connor? But what is she doing? Relaxing on the roof (maybe she wanted to get a tan) and trying to saw the roof. I mean, why not pushing through the roof? A really big flaw in the story: after Skynet has taken over control robots kill all people in the military base and control the entire building. Only John Connor and his future wife survive, find a plane and fly away. Fly away? Where have all the robots gone??? Also it was interesting to learn that coffins and cars are bulletproof by default. And so it goes on and on.... Of course the special effects were good. The best one was definitely to let Arnold look like as if the last 20 years did not happen. He really didn't give the impression to be 50something.<br/><br/>Nevertheless I give it a 5 because the action is quite entertaining. Unfortunately there is no single moment where T3 can hold the standard set by its 2 predecessors."

The Terminatrix, being a hot woman,is a good innovation ... the FX they put on her are fancy,not cutting edge as in T2, but they'll do (i mean the 2 or 3 special effects).She doesn't have to do much, I wouldn't call it even acting, you can write all her lines in this movie in a paper as small as a bus ticket.

","When I first heart that T3 is coming out in Theaters, I was thrilled. I loved the first 2 films and was anxious to see the sequel. I am so glad that I never found the time to watch this movie in the movie theater. I rented it on DVD and what I found was a very average movie by today's standards. Similar action scenes were done before, and the soul of each character was missing. My biggest complain is how pathetic they made John Connor. Correct me if I am wrong, but wouldn't you think that a kid from Terminator 2 would turn out like he did in T3? Not for a minute. Brave 13 year old John Connor was now a 22 year old wimp. Give me a break, what happened? I am to believe that he would lead the army of people to victory against robots in the future? Come on, be serious. The chemistry between Terminator and John was non existent. There was no chemistry even between John and his wife to be. All this was a compilation of action scenes. I must admit that there was plenty of action and very good special effects. This movie was not directed by James Cameron, and it shows. Sequels generally don't work. Terminator 2, however, was better than Terminator, but Terminator 3, in my opinion, is not even close to being on the same level as Terminator. I never thought to regard Lethal Weapon 4 or Bad Boys 2 a better film than T3. I expected way more from this movie and was very disappointed to see Arnold beaten in one scene at the end. The ending was cut abruptly, probably because they want to make the next Terminator movie. I bet they won't even use Arnold next time. It'll probably be something like 'Starship Troopers', except with robots."
"red_core","8","1","2","1 July 2004"," compact, exciting, perfectly executed
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a rare occurrence. It's a third entry to a universally revered and critically acclaimed blockbuster action film series. And yet, it's far more taut and far less ambitious than its prequels. Too many big-budget sequels try to outdo the masterpiece(s) that preceded them by being bigger, badder, longer. In the end, such sequels often underwhelm or fail. Star Wars, the Matrix, the list continues (Lord of the Rings is an exception; ALL THREE films comprising the series are huge and ambitious).<br/><br/>Terminator 2: Judgment Day was a huge, ambitious, ground-breaking sequel to a small, well done, highly-successful production. But in its ambition and scale it succeeded brilliantly, making probably the greatest action film of all time.<br/><br/>T3 doesn't try to be another T2. Its running time is about 90 minutes (compare that with 2.5 hours for the previous entry). Much of the cast is gone, and James Cameron is replaced by some outside screenwriters and Jonathan Mostow directing. Thoughtful ruminations on the nature of man are cut down to some intense, less sweeping in scope, much more personal conversations. The action is almost non-stop, and the sense of urgency is there in every single frame. The result is quite a sight to behold, for any action fan. It's as if the makers of T3 decided to take what made T2 so unusual and throw it away, somehow making this fact a strength. T2 was a great film, but it could be slow in parts (especially the director's cut) and was tough to digest. T3 isn't a great film, but it is excellent, nonetheless, and the pacing is its greatest strength.<br/><br/>T3 is set ""today."" John Connor (now played by Nick Stahl) is in his early 20s, and the date that was to be Judgment Day (nuclear World War III) has passed. His mother is now dead from natural causes, but to her dying day she knew that the machines must not get to her son. The usual time-travel paradox rears its ugly head here, but we'll ignore that. John, who never wanted to be savior of mankind, nevertheless ""lives off the grid"" so that there is no computerized way to get to him.<br/><br/>Ostensibly, there is no Judgment Day, there is no SkyNet, and there should be no machine menace. And yet, a female-looking terminator (the T-X) is sent through time. She starts methodically clipping teenagers (for what reason, we don't know).<br/><br/>The trusty T800 (Arnold, again) also reappears. Clearly he's there to protect John, but his other motives aren't quite known. In any case, soon John Connor, T800, and a seemingly random female veterinarian (Claire Danes) are on the run from from T-X, the law, and who knows what else.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away any more of the strong plot, which is revealed primarily through terse conversations with the good terminator. I'll just say that the plot is well done -- especially considering the hole the T2 ending put the writers into -- and the ending is outstanding.<br/><br/>The plot's fine, but it's the pacing and action that are the true strength of the film. You see (this isn't much of a spoiler, since it was all over the trailers), Judgment Day is *today*. That means our friends have 2-3 hours to do something about it, or else.... The action starts immediately and doesn't really stop. (Case in point: Watch for the VERY FIRST TIME T800 and T-X meet in a scene. The directness of the T800's approach is quite amusing.) There are multiple car chases and many fights. In particular, one of each stands out. First, there's a scene where a mobile crane, with T800 on top, is driven THROUGH several city blocks. It's really something to behold. That is, it's impressive until the finishing stunt, which is simply staggering (even if it could, in principle, be CGI). The other standout action sequence is the T800-T-X hand-to-hand combat scene. You'll see T-X (an attractive, slender female) throw T800 (a hulking body-builder) through several walls in ONE throw. Then you'll see said bodybuilder break a urinal on said model's head. Of course, it wouldn't be a Terminator movie without a SWAT team trying to stop Arnold with bullets, which is always fun due to its futility.<br/><br/>The actionless moments, while few, carry plenty of dramatic weight. John is a reluctant hero, played to perfection by Stahl. Danes is amusing as an action heroine, but her good moments are while she's still just a vet. Arnold is perfect as the Terminator -- in fact, better than ever (and, while he's got a few lines on his face, he's perfectly buff, just like in 1992). He delivers his lines, whether serious or humorous (and there is lot of, perhaps too much, humor) in a perfect dead-pan style. The script, thankfully, doesn't give him anything sentimental (human) to say (correcting one of T2's greatest weaknesses), so he doesn't struggle at any point. The emotional connection between John (or whoever) and T800 is never really explored in depth, avoiding that aspect of the previous film (again, a good move).<br/><br/>The rating I give to this film is 8/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD action film (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that get high scores) needs their head examined. I give it another point because what it does attempt to do it accomplishes so easily and perfectly. (For reference, I gave T2 a ten.) Any true weakness it has is simply that it's just an action movie, and that's it. It's hard to say anything bad (other than nitpicks) about the film itself.<br/><br/>P.S. Some of the later comments on this movie really leave me speechless. You'll get no argument from me: T3 is certainly not T2. But it's not trying to be T2. I know, you don't care what it's trying to be, you just want to be entertained. Well, that's what the film delivers. Any serious comparison (where one wishes T3 was more like T2) to the 2nd Cameron opus is misguided, and only serves to confuse oneself. I wish I could recommend you not to watch T2 before watching this film, to give you a clean slate. But I cannot, since T3 clearly assumes knowledge of both of its two prequels, at least plotwise."

","There are really no words to explains this pathetic waste of a movie. Without James Cameron and Linda Hamilton on board for this latest installment you had to assume that this movie wasn't going to be as good. Don't get me wrong I am probably one of the biggest Terminator fans out there. I followed the storyline from T1 and used that to understand T2 which made for a very good plot. However, T3 comes along, and you can't hope but to think that Director Johnathon Mostow had NO concept of this film and forget the essence of the Terminator Franchise (I.E. Arnold in T3 mentioning his model number as T-101 when in actuality it's T-800 Model 101) I mean whoever wrote this film obviously didn't pay much attention to the other two films.

","No Cameron, Arnie being a tad older and the fact it was twelve years since T2, while I was looking forward to Terminator 3, I was also a bit of wary, but I shouldn't have been. Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines is fantastic, a spectacularly entertaining blockbuster ride that continues the story with respect, great action, a knowing sense of humor and with a seriousness that doesn't drag the film down. Mostow may have seemed like an unusual choice to direct (someone more along the lines of John McTiernan or Ridley Scott would have more accommodating I would have thought), but he does justice to the first two, continuing the saga of John Connor in a way that more than respects the fineness of the first two films.<br/><br/>Essentially the film is a mixture of the first two installments, more so the second one, in the execution of the action sequences (huge chase scene, cyborgs beating each other to a pulp), but like the first one, Mostow favors a more pessimistic tone to the film, giving the film a sense of approaching darkness, especially in the final minutes that is both shocking, touching and moving, in much the same way as Cameron did in the first Terminator film. Mostow does not just put Connor in danger again, have him stop judgment day again and have him live happily ever after again. No, he layers the film with twists and turns such as the fact that the machines' strike on humans was merely delayed and that Connor is now dead in the future, that it his future wife, Katherine (played by Claire Danes) who has sent the T-800 back to save John. <br/><br/>Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong and he is a good replacement, perfectly playing the part with a brooding intensity. Danes is charming and if there is a fourth film I hope she will be in it. Kristanna Loken is great at the T-X. Playing the part with a cold blooded humor that is fantastic to watch and lastly there's Arnie. Let's just say it's like watching someone ride a bike after having not done so for many years. He clearly hasn't forgotten (talk to the hand is right).<br/><br/>All in all Terminator 3 is terrific. A surprising joy from start to finish, one hopes that a forth film will be left alone because as it stands this is a perfect little trilogy."

","For all of you who are interested in renting out this movie, I recommend you do it with the lowest expectations.<br/><br/>Here are some spoilers: 1)  it's an exact copy of #1/#2 I mean, they even use the SAME EXACT PHRASES to try and get you nostalgic for the first 2 movies (which were awesome)<br/><br/>2)  The plan/strategy is not cohesive/inconsistencies in plot: First they are going to protect the other members of the resistance, then they don't and they let them die. Other problems:  Why not send back terminators to just search for John Connors--even if they don't know where he is now?  And why is this version of this terminator (terminatrix) is so stupid (speeding on highways, etc.)? And why not go back to an earlier date (again) to get John Connors?<br/><br/>
There are a lot more spoilers, but I don't want to take away all the fun...<br/><br/>Seriously, do yourself a favor and just wait until there is no other movie you want to see before wasting your time here."

I OWN Killer Klowns from Outer Space. I do NOT own T3.<br/><br/>Nuff said? No?<br/><br/>It is the epitome of puerile. It is under-dramatized, the script is nothing more than cliché after cliché and the focus of the actor seems to be somewhere in the distance, rather than on the situations to which they are supposed to be subjected.<br/><br/>The ""Terminatrix"" was a cool idea, and she pulled it off with a bit of panache and talent. But the effects and function of the T-1000 (Played excellently by Robert Patrick in T2-Judgment Day), were far superior, as was the story line and the direction of the cast.<br/><br/>It's amazing to me to sit in a theater after shelling out a load of money to see a star-studded cast walking around seemingly without any sense of purpose or direction.<br/><br/>It was a sorry, slip-shod excuse for a sequel to the first two movies, which were excellently done and extremely well made, well written and directed by a Master; James Cameron.<br/><br/>On the lighter side; however, the rumor going around the web concerning Mr. Schwarzenegger's having paid out of his own pocket to film the crane scene is a nice thought. I wonder if it's true? Does anyone know?<br/><br/>And, I am looking forward with (only a small degree now of...) hope for the future run of War of the Machines movies which are now made possible by the storyline.<br/><br/>I can only hope someone comes to their senses and brings back James Cameron to do them.

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>T3 is a belated prequel to the 1991 sequel,also starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.Returning to the role that set him on the road to international superstardom,Arnie here reprises his role as the machovelian Terminator.It's hard to say whether or not the first two films director,James Cameron,had it in mind to make this third instalment,or whether this is yet another idea for a movie thought up by unimaginative Hollywood execs unable to come up with original ideas and so just resorting to resurrecting long dormant franchises (although the first sequel did come seven years after the original).But all the same,he isn't and in his place,we have Breakdown helmer Johnathon Mostow.Whether or not this is because Cameron was dissatisfied with the outcome of the script is unknown,but Mostow is a competent enough director as his past efforts have shown.One thing his film is lacking,though, that was dominating Cameron's first two and pretty much made them indistinguishable,is the dark feel that set the scene,in it's place a more lively,jolty feel that will either make or break the film for you.Although,the film's plot just seems like a rehash of the last one with a few things thrown in for window dressing.It's also got to contend with underwhelming set pieces,lifeless humour and rather unappealing dialogue.There are some clever ideas here and there (which are never explored to their full potential though) and there is the gorgeous Kristanna Lokken to add eye candy to the proceedings (she can come and terminate me any day).But overall it has to be described as a rather pointless experience that's box office performance will probably warrant a follow up but which certainly doesn't get your appetite wetted for it's arrival.**"
"thestorm_50","10","1","2","6 August 2003"," Worthy to the Terminator franchise!
","I have been following Terminator 3's progress since day one. And the day came when I finaly saw it. With out a doubt a masterpiece. But it took more then one viewing to see Mostow's vision.<br/><br/>Too much these days people need them to explain a story by words, and dialouge, like your mother telling you a bedtime story. T3 is one of those deeper movies that once you look past the action there are some deep thoughts, and morality issues it talks about. I love where they took the story, and the character's especially John.<br/><br/>Thoguh I am mad to know as a huge fan I followed T3 from day one, watched every interview/set report ect. There was about 40 mintues cut from the movie. Including:<br/><br/>-10 Minute Future War Sequence.<br/><br/>-An Alternate Opening Credits with the T3 song from soundtrack.<br/><br/>
-From some people/the book there was a little more of the stripper joint, and the T-850 did more dammage to the bouncer.<br/><br/>-A few more scenes like more of the T-850 grabbing his shotgun after running over the T-X.<br/><br/>-The T-X killing Liz Anderson a 10 year old girl.<br/><br/>-T-X and more of her and the cop like her saying the exact speed she was going.<br/><br/>-The T-X going to Bill Anderson's house, and breaking in.<br/><br/>-More of the champion crane sequence you can tell easily by the editing.<br/><br/>
-Way more talk in the Tundra with John and the T-850 talking about Judgment Day and the upgrades the T-850 has.<br/><br/>-A little more of the store scene, the T-850 grabs the glasses.<br/><br/>
-More of John talking in the back of the Tundra with Kate.<br/><br/>
-Flashbacks of young John and Kate, we could tell from IMDB's young John in the credits early on.<br/><br/>-From old set reports and eye witnesses I think the T-850 disabled or maybe even killed cops originaly in the graveyard shoot out because they talked about how he did kill people in that scene long ago.<br/><br/>-More of the Graveyard chase, the T-X right behind them and John is shooting at her.<br/><br/>-Way more of a slow scene what it was we may never know from the book either the author of the book said he had to change the versions so many times. That is why it was delayed from June to late July because WB changed it so much. But I think there was much more of a slow desert T2 kind of scene between John and Kate and the Terminator. Just more talking.<br/><br/>
-So so so much more of the CRS Labs. Showing how the Terminator's survived and Skynet. And all of the early prototypes being made including the 101 from the real human Arnold Sgt. Candy.<br/><br/>-Shows how the T-X gets to the CRS labs with the chopper and gets in.<br/><br/>
-How Kate/John/T-850 get into CRS, she calls him Uncle Tom. The T-850 shoots some guards in the knee caps.<br/><br/>-More of the T-850 talking to General Brewster about the line he said 'I was made here.'<br/><br/>-Extened Bathroom sequence where they accually go through the floor.<br/><br/>
-You can tell by editing and the book that originaly they had Kate/John fight a T-1 as well, or at least run from it. But they cut it out.<br/><br/>
-Shows from pictures that we see the T-X get out of the particle accelerator and she sees the disabled T-850 standing there and she jumps in the chopper. As she saw John/Kate take off.<br/><br/>-Now this scene I gathered from set reports and old talks. I think originaly the T-850 came on line and walked across the air strip with the T-1's shooiting everyone and he is in the midst of it all walking to the big chopper. -Way more of the accual 'Rise of the machines' more of the T-1's killing everyone.<br/><br/>-Alternate End fight. From set reports and interviews with Stan/Arnold and Larisis or what ever said the same thing I heard. That there was originaly a huge tunnel chase where the T-X in full endo form ran after the T-850/John and Kate. And it was more of a epic battle between the two. Very expensive but cut sadly enough.<br/><br/>These were things we either got from set reports ect.<br/><br/>There was an alternate end fight, it will be in the DVD/Game it self.<br/><br/>
Though it stinks that these cuts were made the movie was still worthy of the franchise. James Cameron thought so, he loved the movie. And we all know James does not just say things to be nice.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines 9.6/10<br/><br/>Highs: Great story, depth, and some serious issues talked about. Great acting and dialouge and ending.<br/><br/>Lows: Too much cut, not enough of everything. Lots of the detailed story scenes were cut.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: A great film on every level. Not as good as Terminator 2 but I doubt any movie will ever accomplish that. That is a hard feat. But Terminator 3 is one of the best movies I've seen in years, and so worth the long wait."

"Atra","1","1","2","30 July 2003"," A turn for the worse
","Personally i found both the first and the second film quite enjoyable, not the greatest films i´ve seen but good nonetheless. When i first heard that T3 was in the making i was actually quite pleased and thought that after such a long time they would have developed an interesting plot. What i was expecting was a much darker film than the first two, and perhaps one that would be more of an epic, great battles between men and machines, more thoughts and reflections concerning the issues that lies as the foundation for the movies. I was however, greatly disappointed with this film for more than one reason.<br/><br/>Firstly i found the humour awfully misplaced and inappropriate. I couldn´t believe that they would do this to a movie that quite naturally had high demands from the audience, to me T3 is close to being an action/comedy, and that´s not meant in a good sence... Secondly the story is just bizarre, it´s all action and nothing else, mindless action with no substance. Maybe my expectations were too high but i just can´t help being so disappointed, the underlying theme and thought behind this movie could have made it great, but right now i´m thinking that the time i spent watching T3 is never coming back to me, makes me a little bit angry actually...."
"CSe7en","10","1","2","3 August 2003"," Rise of the Mostow/ Extremely brave piece of storytelling. (Spoilers)
","I don't know what I was expecting with this installment of the popular Terminator franchise. I really enjoyed Mostow's previous films 'Breakdown' and 'U-571'. But it was not the look or the direction of the film that worried me but the story. The early premise of the film seemed to be an exact replica of T-2 but less Linda Hamilton an older John Connor with love interest and a sexy, beautiful and more effective killing machine T-X. I imagined that once again Judgement Day was going to happen and once again Connor with protecting Terminator would save the day.<br/><br/>But the script with a wicked sense of humour was brave and original, well mostly. I loved the ending and I wasn't expecting it, I thought we were going to get a soapy ending. I was fascinated by the destiny of man and whether they can do anything to stop it even when the characters are clearly told it. It was also leaner, I thought that Cameron in the writing process may have spread out the idea of the Terminator having a split personality over his operating functions.<br/><br/>By the way Arnie looked the best he ever has in his leather threads. Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken are extremely sexy in differing ways and I felt Nick Stahl played John Connor very well as a neurotic young man with the burden of the fate of humanity on his shoulders.<br/><br/>There was maybe one major goof the two scribes made though, and I don't know if they were just treating the audience as idiots. But in the camper on the way to Robert Brewster the issue comes up that the Termiantor has been sent back not by Connor but by Brewster a future leading General in the Resistance. Why Brewster and not Connor because in 2032 Connor gives the order for the Terminator of Arnie's type to terminate him. Connor says something on the lines of 'who killed me' and the Terminator says 'I did'. Well so far during the film the Terminator has expressed on a number occasions how he has come of an assembly line and has nothing to do with the 'Uncle Bob' model sent back in 1992. The Termiantor in T-3 has no way to get back to the future and he surely knows his fate at the start of the mission and if he has nothing to with 'Uncle Bob' he will have nothing to do with the Termiantor that will do the deed. Arnie later says to Connor 'Thank you' for holding up the automative door and Arnie say 'We will meet again'. But maybe that is understandable because that Terminator though not sent back by Connor probably met him in the future.<br/><br/>Will there be another Termiantor film, well 'there is no fate except for what we make it'. So I suppose if everybody gets to the cinema and sees this film as many times as possible the better the chance of T-4. Would I like to see another Termiantor post 'Judgement Day' you better ya. The chances it would be a major turkey increases but if they get the brilliant Mostow and the same scribes it should be alright. But first I am looking forward to the remake of 'Westworld' with the Arnie and the T-3 scribes."
"estern","10","1","2","31 July 2003"," Fantastic Action/Sci-Fi Film
","I wrote a comment earlier on this film and feel compelled to write another. I really love this movie.  I can understand the people who say that it isn't as good as T1 or T2 and what have you, but who can honestly say that Arnold has made a better film than T3 since his last collaboration with James Cameron?  Seriously, folks... True Lies was released 9 years ago!  T3 breaks the string of bad/mediocre Arnold flics.<br/><br/>Some people have really gotten onto the screenwriters for T3.  News Flash: T3 was as inevitable as is the human race eventually destroying itself.  The writers did what they absolutely HAD to do to have the series make sense. T3 did not render the previous time travel philosophies of T1 and T2 irrelevent.  T1 said that time was cyclical.  T2 said that some things can be changed.  T3 said that some things can't.  How does T3 conflict with T1 and T2?  Simple answer is it doesn't.  It simply says that some things no matter how much you want them to, cannot change.  Destiny.  There may be no fate but what we make, only within the confines of a certain set of rules.<br/><br/>In sum, T3 is a great film.  But for the comparisons to T1 and T2, I would say it's near flawless.  I think that the people who are criticizing this would be best off going back to watching such masterpieces of cinema as the Bridges of Madison County and Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood.  As Arnold says on the commentary track of Conan the Barbarian, ""if you believe that (people who like those movies would like T3) you also believe that there're Richard Simmons Jr's running around!"""

But ignore this weakness, everything is perfect.T-X is really a dangerous and hot and beautiful killing machine. I am wondering why there are some saying that T-1000 (T2) was more dangerous than T-X. She is ,T-X, is faster.And T-1000 did not have any gun and he could not bend his shape like T-X can.One more thing and is the most dangerous thing about T-X is she can control and give orders to other machines.This is very obvious, even Terminator was under her control to fight against John Corner.So do you guys think this female machine is more dangerous ? In T2, there was only one bad guy (T-1000). In this time, there are lots of killing machines controled by T-X.<br/><br/>There are lots of hot actions that worth to see.I am very impressed when the two ultimate machines fighting each other. And when they chasing each other on the roads.And I think the end is very good.It gives us some to think of such as we are killing ourselves by our weapons and machines....Every actor in this film , I think, has completly accomplished their roles.Congratulations Go Cameron, I am waiting for T4.

","'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' has an approach a little different than the first two Terminator-films. 'The Terminator' and 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' had some humor but most of all it had great action with beautiful special effects and they were meant seriously. It had some ideas about time traveling that made the movies more interesting. This second sequel does not take itself too seriously. The special effects are there, but the way they play with the time traveling this time is just too much. Fortunately there is some great humor in this one, another sign that you must not take it too seriously.<br/><br/>I had a feeling the story didn't matter much, which it did with the first two. Everything was made for some thrilling moments, pretty well done, some great special effects and some nice humor. The new terminator called Terminatrix, played by Kristanna Loken, is nice but the Arnold Schwarzenegger from the first and the Robert Patrick from the second film had something Loken is missing. I didn't like Nick Stahl as well. Edward Furlong was so great in 'T2' that Nick Stahl almost looks bad. The scenes with him and his future wife played by Claire Danes are sometimes a little annoying.<br/><br/>May be it sounds like I didn't like the movie very much. That is definitely not true. Because it is a sequel I compare with the other movies from the series and it can't win from those first two movies. But compare it with almost any other sci-fi action movie and this one is better. It is very well made, has suspense and humor and Schwarzenegger is back in the role perfect for him."

There are SPOILERS following in this text so don't read it in case you haven't seen the flick!<br/><br/>It's far better made than T1(no wonder...)and also has a better storyline, etc. but the Terminator-Feeling just didn't come up.<br/><br/>Arnie is far too tame. He wasn't as menacing.............. The R-Rating also is a joke. I mean part one was very violent,part 2 toned down the violence(there were short and effective bursts of violence), part 3 only got the R because of the infamous ""killing the detective"" scene and for the nudity. Arnie was not responsible for any of the movie's violence.

In fact, I don't think I've ever been so impressed by action scenes in some of the more recent movies. Watching that bathroom fight, I started thinking to myself,""You know, I don't care if you are a machine. That had to hurt!"" As for the performances, I can't say enough about Arnold. The new character I liked the most was Claire Danes' Kate Brewster. I really felt for her character. Her fear, her grief and her confusion. She really gave a great performance. Nick Stahl was good, even though he looked nothing like the John Connor in the previous film. Kristanna Loken is awesome as the T-X. I didn't think her character would be as ominous as the previous Terminators. I was wrong.<br/><br/>If I have any gripes, it's the pacing. This movie just jumped too quickly into the plot and it leaves some questions unanswered. I want to know how Arnold got his shotgun and how he found John and Kate at the beginning. But the ending more than made up for it. It really made me think. In fact, I better turn off my computer now before it's too late! I'll just leave by saying this: They can make as many action movies as they want, but none will ever top the excitement and entertainment of the Terminator series. Bring on T4! 10/10"
"eckhouse24","10","1","2","13 July 2003"," Arnolds Back!!!!!
","Terminator 3 is fantastic. The best film of the summer and proves that Arnold still looks good in an action film. <br/><br/>I'm not going to sit here and give you the plot, you can read that in the other posts. What I will tell you is that some of the people who bashed this movie are wrong.<br/><br/>I first heard someone say that Terminator 3 is nothing more than a prequel to the Matrix. I beg to differ. The whole Humans vs Machines in the future came about in the first Terminator, back in 1984. If anything, the Matrix is just a sequel to the Terminator series, going beyond 2029, or 2032.<br/><br/>
As for the comedic tone, I saw the film 3 times all ready, and each time I have seen it, all the jokes seem to have gotten a great response. As for the Action, I think all in all, people were treated to something more than a few slow motion kung fu scenes. Terminator 3 refuses to go the way most action films have gone. Having a movie directed towards a well choregraphed fighting scene. <br/><br/>Granted, Terminator 3 seems to be missing about 20 minutes of film, which is why the story does seem a little rushed, but at this point in the series, we don't need much character development. We know John Connor, we know the Terminators, all we really needed to know was Kate Brewster, and we get all that information in the middle of the film...<br/><br/>As for why Arnold doesn't shoot one person while carrying the coffin, all though in the past(or future) Arnold killed John, is it impossible to believe that Kate Brewster while reprogramming the terminator, programmed him not to kill humans.....Just an IDEA<br/><br/>All in all **** out of ****- This film delivers for me."
"abhor","1","1","2","10 July 2003"," Terrible
","Let me start by saying that like many, I am a great fan of previous Terminator movies, and when I heard they are making a new Terminator I was very enthusiastic and imagined all the huge possibilities that movie could have.<br/><br/>When I first saw that Terminator 3 is not directed nor written by James Cameron, my hopes came a bit down. When I saw that role of the evil terminator would be played by a model who has no acting experience I began to get the feeling how this movie would be. I tried to prepare myself for the failure for a long time. But nothing could prepare me for this... The movie was awful. I don't think I have ever been disappointed in any other movie this much.<br/><br/>In T-3 they do everything I hoped they wouldn't do. They have added totally unnecessary humour in spots that it doesn't fit in at all. The script is terrible, and whole movie has no content. The movie totally lacks the dark and somewhat distressing feeling the previous Terminator movies had, especially the first one. When watching T-3 at some points I thought if they are serious about this movie at all. Kristanna Loken:s roleplay is plain annoying, every time she comes to screen she does something stupid... She has lines that a robot surely wouldn't say. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a bit better, but it's obvious that Cameron was the one who was keeping both the story and Arnolds roleplay together. Writers have tried to find new ""legendary"" comments but fail with an embarrassing way.<br/><br/>Jonathan Mostow:s amateurish directingwork combined with low-class storywriters has made a sequel that totally ruins Terminator series and disrespects its great predecessors. All I can say is I hope I would have never seen this movie. If they do any more of these terrible sequels to get money by abusing the name, I will not watch them."
"twist1980","10","1","2","10 July 2003"," Very impressed
","I was a huge fan of the first two movies, and when I heard that they were making a third I was very excited.  Naturally, before the movie I read different reviews, many which criticized the action sequences in the movie. They compared them to The Matrix and said that the technology did not match up.  Well, I would think that anyone that has seen Terminator would know that it is not about ""Matrix style"" fighting.  I thought the action sequences were great and the interaction between the old and new characters was fantastic.  I don't know how many times I've sat through a movie, and whether I enjoy it or not, sit there and think...how mich time is left??  At the end of Terminator (which is 110 minutes long), I was couldn't believe I had just spent 2 hours in a theatre.  It completly flew by.  They left the movie open for one more, hopefully they will take care of that opening.  I would advise anyone to see this movie."

","The film runs close to 2 hours but with the pace of the action and the interesting storyline I found the movie to be over so quickly.<br/><br/>
You can tell right away that T-3 was directed by someone different than the previous two. There is a different style. This movie has great atmosphere and doesn't take itself too seriously. The characters poke fun at themselves which makes this movie seem very fresh even though it is a 3rd installment.<br/><br/>After a long dry spell and some health issues, ARNOLD is BACK!!! He makes his entrance into the movie with a nude scene similar to the opening of the prvious two Terminator's. You'll probably think as I did...""Wow, he looks ripped for 55!!!"" He has shrunken from his prime. You don't see much of Arnold's muscle after the first scene. He wears heavy black leather which can make one of those anorexic Tyra Banks model wannabe's look big. Most of Arnolds fight scenes are actually chasing scenes not requiring him to do much physical activity. Sure he is hanging from a crane be dragged through buildings but we all know that those are special effects...and not really him, let alone any other Mr. Universe.<br/><br/>Said all this the movie is fresh, very entertaining and is the best of the big action movies so far!!! It does it's job and makes a case for a T-4. One question...if Arnold loves Hummer's so much why is he driving a Toyota Pick-up the whole movie? It would have been much more entertaining to see him ripping around the streets in one of those new Hummer H2's...GM could have brought out a special edition and call it an H3. You saw it in T3 now you can own your very own H3. Come on!!!"
"Droogie502","10","1","2","9 July 2003"," Best Film Of The Summer!!! Listen To Me!!!
","Just as everyone else, I walked into the theater very skeptical, pretty doubt ridden about this 3rd installment. You all know the reasons, I'll skip those. At age 24, I now have matured as a filmgoer in the sense that I can really indentify a well made flick when I see one. Listen to me when I say that T3 is not only the best film of the summer, but of the best of the year.<br/><br/>Those out there that are tired of CGI dominated action flicks will especially appreciate the large, large amount of stunt work done to avoid as much CGI as possible. The film has more action sequences than any other action flick before, and the best part is none of it is overkill, it's all necessary for the plot. The screenplay really blew me away, it was reported that Schwartzenegger went through several scripts until he found the one that struck him hard. I will not give anything away but it really allows for great acting turns from the whole cast (Schwartzenegger is in absolute top-form) specifically Mr. Stahl and Ms. Danes who have incredible chemistry.<br/><br/>Matrix Reloaded, Hulk, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and other soon to be big budget dissapointments cannot hold a candle to T3, proving once again that a Terminator flick will always destroy every other entry into the sci-fi genre. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the T-X Ms. Lokken who is blazingly sexy and dangerous, was a great casting call. I rate this film a SOLID 10 OUT OF 10, it was definately every second of the 12 years we had to wait, so get out of your seat and shut down your computer and get your keister into the theater, for 109 minutes of the most fun you can have!!!"

","It's entertaining, it doesn't drag, it lacks cliches, the script is clever and witty, the acting is good, the characters' actions are plausible, the ending is original, and overall the movie is better than the previous two Terminators. Wow! Just when Matrix Reloaded had made me completely lose faith in the sci-fi / action movie genre, T3 comes as a refreshing, pleasant surprise."

","I recently watch T3. And I didn't know what to expect from this movie or anything! I believe that it isn't BETTER than T2 but just as good as - BUT TOO SHORT. I think TX was brilliant and the new Terminator was good (darker than the last Terminator etc.) John Conner was ok I suppose yet disappointing not to see Edward reprise his role.<br/><br/>The ending, I must say was quiet sad in a dramatic way, considering the EFFORT they put in to save the world was pointless ONLY to realise that they couldn't save anyone...<br/><br/>-- BUT!!!!!<br/><br/>Now that he knows of these events. I'm sure he can send someone back to prevent SKYNET EVER going online - That would be his mission and he would surely save everyone. Its OPEN for a fourth installment and I must say that I loved TX - Kristanna was AMAZING and SEXY! The terminatrix was sexy. Not often you meet a girl who can make her breats bigger.<br/><br/>The Special FX was great. I wasn't sure if the future sequence were all models of CGI - They were good but I didn't like Nicholas playing older John in the future...I like the fact that the Terminator that killed future John protects the past John (that's funny) - It has its humurous moments. The ending IS FANTASTIC from the last 2.<br/><br/>Don't expect it to be better than T2. Just sit and enjoy it all - A fantastic sci-fi film. Maybe a classic...dunno. Be entertained - I think most original films have past now. At least it isnt falling like my favourite ALIENS franchise. That needs to be saved.<br/><br/>Fatastic. But my favourite is the ending and the TX.<br/><br/>9/10 JUST SIT BACK and enjoy it."

","I'm going to try to do my best to make it sound like I'm not on Arnold's payroll.  This was quite a remarkable movie. I liked it better then T2 because I thought the dialog was better in some places.  T2 has in inkling of cheesyness in some of the dialog, but nothing that reaches the heights of cheesyness we had to endure with Cameron's Titanic.  I also though it had more solid acting, for the most part. Kudos to Arnold for being able to whip himself into shape for this role! Does this man ever age? One thing I wondered about is why they never explained why this cyborg was female.  Also, isn't it a step backwards from the robot we saw in the last movie?  I thought the liquid metal guy was much more scary. Despite these niggles, it's still a great flick."

Thank You Arnold Schwarzengger. Thank You Warner Bros. Thank You Mostow. You guys promised we would not be disappointed and you were right....TERMINATOR 3 HAS BECOME MY FAVOURITE SCI-FI MOVIE OF ALL TIME. CGI is used sparingly...70 % of the stunts were done by Schwarzenegger himself...hence him getting injured frequently. The actions and effects look real......BEACUSE THEY ARE REAL.

"stamp1","10","1","2","6 July 2003"," This Movie Was Perfect-Ignore ANY NEGATIVE Reviews!!!
","This was probably the best movie ever made! Period. Maybe better than Finding Nemo, or The Lord Of The Rings movies. Definitely better than the Matrix movies. It was a 15 out of 10 rating-wise. <br/><br/>It had non-stop action for 2 hours. (No boring philosophy discussions for 20 minutes at a time to slow the movie down.) It was hilarious!! Lots of funny one-liners and sight gags, Arnold is getting better as a comedian. The Special Effects were unbelievable! The BEST EVER!!! The best vehicle chase scene in a year filled with movies full of chase scenes!! (The chase scenes in this movie were BETTER than the one in the Matrix 2 Reloaded, better than ones in 2 Fast 2 Furious, The Recruit, or even Cradle 2 The Grave. Or The Bourne Identity from last year.) The newest female terminatrix was the best ever, even Arnold (an emotionless robot) seemed to fear her, because she was undefeatable it seemed. (You'll have to see the movie to find out if she was ever defeated!!). The movie had lots of scary parts where we think the good guys will die, and the evil bitchy terminatrix will destroy everyone. (I loved how Arnold converted their car into a convertible topless car.)<br/><br/>So there you have it: Non-stop action, greatest FX ever, greatest vehicles chase scenes ever, funniest action film of all time, Arnold in his finest film role ever, perfect script, scary, EXCITING, a SURPRISE ENDING!!, great evil parts, and the ending was not totally happy, but it was sort of a downer, but still there was hope (for the world, and for another sequel too!) The most PERFECT movie ever made. But after watching this movie I am afraid of the internet!!!<br/><br/>I could not think of any way this movie could have been improved, EXCEPT if it had free admission!! I thought the most hilarious line was Arnold's ""Talk to the hand!"" You'll have to see the movie to understand why this line IS SO FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"zetes","8","1","2","5 July 2003"," Falls short of the first two in intelligence, but it's excellent summer fare
","It doesn't quite reach the levels of the first two installments, and, indeed, it often seems like little more than a quick cashing in on those films, but Terminator 3, for everything it's not, proves to be one of the most entertaining summer blockbusters in recent memory. The action sequences are a lot of fun; they are unbelievable and preposterous, but that doesn't detract from the visceral entertainment they provide. The Terminator and his enemy, the T-X, get the hell banged out of them as they are hit by numerous vehicles, are thrown about, and live through enormous explosions. The T-X does lack the menace of Arnold Schwarzenegger's original Terminator and the liquid terminator of T2, but, heck, I'm all about sexy terminatrices. Kristanna Loken is not a good actress, but she's sexy. She gets to wear red leather through the whole movie, and she can even increase her bust size on command. This film has a great B-movie quality to it in that way. An element of humor has been added to this film. In a way, I like the seriousness of the first two films. Terminator is a study in narrative economy, and it doesn't take time out to joke. Terminator 2 sticks to its convictions, however paranoid, and that was refreshing for a film of its type. Terminator 3 is a little smarmy with its humor, but, for the most part, its jokes succeeded in making me laugh. I love how he gets his leather jacket in this movie is very funny. I could have done without the endless parodying of Schwarzenegger's famous lines from the first two films, especially `I'll be back,' which has a dozen variations here. As for the acting, not much is required, of course. I'm very upset that Ed Furlong isn't back for this one. What better did he have to do? Nick Stahl is a poor replacement, and this is probably my major complaint with the movie. Clair Danes is a weird creature. I've always been biased against her ever since she starred in My So Called Life. She isn't a particularly good actress, but she's been improving, however slowly. What's especially odd is that she's actually getting more and more gawky as she ages. She was beautiful as a teenager, and, while still very attractive, I'd take the younger version. I suppose it's unfair to critique her looks. Her performance is fine. Nothing special, as with the other actors. The script generally writes itself (it's more or less a constant chase, much like the first movie), but it does have an inspired third act. If you enjoy action movies, jump into a matinee, enjoy the air conditioning, the popcorn, and the explosions. 8/10."
"craig.tuohy","8","1","2","27 June 2003"," By god they did it!
","I entered last nights screening of Terminator 3 with utter trepidation. No Linda Hamilton, No James Cameron and no skynet. I wasn't sure how they could ever continue the story when Judgement day was avoided at the end of T2.<br/><br/>Thank god though, they did it. By the skin of their teeth they managed to convince. It didn't look good at one point. The movie starts fairly drably. Some tired clichÃ©'s are rolled out. People's shock at seeing a naked person walking at night, Arnie kicking some ass, leather, sunglasses (with a neat twist). What hits you straight away is that this movie is a product of 'new' hollywood. The camera is shy of any on screen blood letting and manages to cut away just before the rot sets in. While obviously a concession to the censors, it does also have the knock on effect of watering down the brutality of the terminators. You just don't get that sense of ruthlessness that the movie's predecessors had.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the next emotion you get is one of total dissapointment at the new Terminatrix. Her entrance is cringeworthy. I'm not sure how a wooden Terminator is supposed to be scary, but this new villain is so devoid of personality It has the most detrimental effect to the power of the machines. At this point I thought all was lost but from here on out things only get better.<br/><br/>We meet John Conner, and it is a very satisfying introduction. John has been permanently scarred by the events in 1991. And has lived a life of solitude and anonymity to avoid being tracked down by any remnants of skynet or the machines. Fat lot of good it did him as fate puts him right back into the path of destruction. And then the chase begins again. And what a chase it is. John hooks up with a girl from his past by means of a plot contrivance that isn't anywhere near as hard to swallow as it probably should be, and they both do a runner together (reluctantly at first) under the protection of the haggered and obsolete T-100. This iteration of John conner (played by Nick Stahl) is very convincing. He looks like a man who has been alone for most of his life. A man who misses his Mother yet resents her at the same time. And when he explains to Claire Danes's character Kate Brewster what is going on, there is a glint in his eye that suggest that although he fears that it is all beginning again, he is quietly satisfied that he maybe isn't crazy after all, and more than that, that he isn't alone anymore.<br/><br/>One of the beautiful things about this movie is that Arnie's age, iconic status as 80's action hero and subsequent fall from grace all add up to make him the perfect Terminator for this movie. Hopelessly outdated by the new bells and whistles terminators, past his prime and unloved, the movie sometimes seems like a metaphor for Arnie himself. Seeing him throwing a CGI monster through walls and numerous panes of glass is almost like a the old guard saying ""yes, you have all the fancy gadgets and computer power, but at least we didn't mind getting our hands dirty"".<br/><br/> >From the moment the chase begins, it doesn't seem to end. It is action all the way. And boy what action. CGI is used sparingly and cleverly. The show off camera trickery is kept to a minimum and it all has a very old school feel. In fact, it all feels very true to the Terminator universe. Pulsing music rather than full blown orchestrations, mass civil destruction, utter disregard for subtlety, the action scenes in this movie easily stand up to those of any of the other movies. And they seem far less contrived to boot. My only criticism would be that they were all that little bit too familiar. Chases on bikes, trucks, helicopters etc. These are all conventions of the Terminator universe that T3 happily borrows, but the movie seems reluctant to invent any of it's own.<br/><br/>The one convention it does try to instill, or maybe develop from T2 is morality. There are scenes where the Terminator is forced to make Moral choices and show traces of humanity. While some in the cinema found this all a bit ridiculous, I actually found it fairly touching and a nice addition to the story. Arnie's internal struggle almost seeming more than that of circuitry and processing power.<br/><br/>About the story. It's the strongest of the 3. By all rights it should be laughed right out of town, but they actually get away with it. The existence of skynet and the rise of the machines is brilliantly explained using some very clever twists and reflections of current society. In fact, I would like to have seen more of this side of the plot. It is only there to facilitate the action set pieces but it had enough weight to carry the movie into more philosophical territory, rather than just another (albeit very good) chase movie.<br/><br/>There are faults with the movie. I kept waiting for an explanation to why exactly the newest Terminator is a woman. Something about it being easy for her to infiltrate the very male dominated society of the future, or mans one weakness being their libido. Anything would have sufficed and the material could have used some philosophising on mans weakness to the opposite sex being it's biggest downfall in the war against the sexless machines. Alas, no such reasoning is given. It is just accepted and john Conner refers to her as 'The Terminatrix' as if she is an old family member. Also, as the arch villain, she just simply is not very menacing. Partly due to woeful acting and a script that is wholly recycled from Robert Patricks turn in T2, but also partly due to the fact that she is actually a bit.rubbish. Why, after the liquid metal killing machine of 1991 do the machines go back to making an exo-skeleton robot? It simply makes no sense. She seems like a model way down the evolutionary chain from the T1000. Even her flamethrower hand is far from intimidating and more reminiscent of the teachers in the B-movie schlockfest 'Class of 1999'.. Also, humour. Arnie has too many one liners. The Terminators are a girly girl and a stand up comedian. How scared do are we supposed to be? We want ruthles, not sexy and cute.<br/><br/>Also, if I have to see another secret underground base in a movie I'm gonna shoot someone. Hoolywood take note. Audiences aren't impressed with styrofoam rocks and banks of flashing lights. Setting the final act on a dodgy set with bad Doctor Who style robots will impress noone. Just once I want to see a movie like this end in a big tropical forest or a desert. Anywehere that doesn't have a self destruct sequence and really annoying alarms.<br/><br/>Other faults include plot goofs that make certain meetings and situations unbelievable. For example, Claire Danes's character has to go to her place of work at an ungodly hour in the morning, whereby the Terminatrix shows up to execute her. But why would the Terminatrix go there in the middle of the night when her target is not supposed to be there?<br/><br/>But all these are small niggles swept under the carpet by the majesty of the denoument. I won't ruin it, but the ending is ballsy, jaw dropping and unexpected. Not only that but it does 100% justice to the integrity of the series. It marks the end of a chapter and it does it in style. They could never make another Terminator movie and the trilogy would go down in history with the Star Wars' and the Die Hard's (as apposed to the Alien's and Jaws'), or they could make another and take it in a whole new direction. It is a truly great ending. Not just satisfying and fitting, but great. The kind of ending people will talk about in 10 years time.<br/><br/>I'm very happy to report that the story is what makes this movie work. Which makes a surprising change for a summer blockbuster. I had very little faith in this movie, but it sits proudly alongside the first two to make one of the best action trilogy's in hollywoods pantheon. What a relief."

","Schwarzenegger is great and funny, but the guy who played John Conner was a bad casting choice. I hate to be negative, but I'm not sure what his appeal was to the casting directors - his acting skills were subpar (didn't seem emotionally connected enough at times) and he seemed sooo different from the younger John Conner they had in the second Terminator movie. I didn't find it believable that they were supposed to be the same person. There'd been all this build up to ""the great John Conner"" over the previous Terminator movies, but I was so underwhelmed by this actor. Linda Hamilton's absence is also greatly felt. Maybe she could've helped carry the movie - Clare Danes and the guy who played John Conner just can't pull it off in my opinion. Schwarzenegger is perfect for comedic effect, but he's not really ever the protagonist in these movies in the traditional sense, even though the series was named for his character. He was the best part of this movie; it's saving grace, I guess. Overall, it's an okay movie, but the first two Terminator movies were way better."

"OllieSuave-007","6","1","3","16 May 2014"," It's OK, just missed the mark.
","It was nice seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger back in action as the Terminator for this movie, still fresh and funny with his funny one-liners and quick wit, and still proving he can kick some major butt. The events of Terminator 2 have only delayed the completion of Skynet, which has sent the evil T-X (Kristanna Loken) to assassinate the future officers of TechCom and eliminate drifter John Connor (Nick Stahl). But the Resistance sends a T-800 (Schwarzenegger) from the future to the present time to protect drifter John Connor (Nick Stahl) and stop T-X.<br/><br/>This film has the same destitute, war-fearing atmosphere as in the previous films. There are some intense action and cool special effects that highlight a slew of spectacular new weaponry the Terminator and T-X possess. The cast of characters is nicely assembled, with Stahl and and Claire Danes doing a decent job in portraying John Connor and Kate Brewster. The plot, however, lacks the urgency and suspense of the previous films and didn't have much character development, which would have made the characters more memorable and sympathized; you don't learn much from their backgrounds. The story didn't offer much originality - it basically rehashed SkyNet's continued threat to make Judgement Day happen, making this film just a mesh of action with limited drama.<br/><br/>Overall, Terminator 3 is a lot of sci-fi action fun, but misses the mark in story and character developments.<br/><br/>Grade C"
"HawkHerald","3","1","3","29 December 2013"," Too Little, Too Late
","If there was really going to be a movie showing the events leading up to Judgment Day then it should have been in theaters between 1993-1995. As it is, this abomination was scrapped together from sloppy remnants. Only a still buff but dated looking Arnold Schwarzenegger as returns the T-800 sent back to stop the T-X from murdering Kate Brewster (Claire Daines) and John Connor (Nick Stahl). The T-X (Kristanna Loken) is an endoskeleton with built-in weapons, the same ability to change appearance as the T-1000 and she can control machines. She commandeers a woman's convertible, cop car and several construction vehicles, and begins killing John Connor's future Human Resistance lieutenants. Her ultimate mission is to infect America's computer controlled nuclear arsenal with a virus that would launch the United States' nuclear weapons. John Connor has been living a nomadic, off-the-grid lifestyle since the T-2 events. His narration mentions that Judgment Day never happened and though he and his mom had destroyed Skynet in the past, he never shook the feeling that something terrible happening was inevitable. The movie starts out well but ends being filled with bad jokes, a weak story and even worse performances. Claire Daines was badly miscast and grows so annoying you end up cheering for the T-X to waste her. Nick Stahl is an underwhelming John Connor, boring but not terrible. He looks like a homeless stoner expecting to wake up from a bad trip. Schwarzenegger is playing a role he knows very well but that's not exactly a good thing since he's rehashing an old character for a fat paycheck. Kristanna Loken is a beautiful woman and that's about it, she's a non-acting performer in this. This movie was the end of The Terminator as a relevant franchise."

There is a reason one of the main characters played by Linda Hamilton turned down the script.When she declined they killed her off,said she had cancer and put guns in her casket.Need I say more?Arnie tells more jokes rather than acting like a machine.The villain or Terminatrix is a mute model that offers nothing.This film marks the start of the reboot,remake and rehash of classic movies.The sad thing is Cameron wanted to do it but wanted more time.His disappointment reflects the majority of fans including me.Anyone who liked it all I can say is I hope you enjoy transformers 4;)"

","Standards which it could never achieve, and wasn't really meant to anyways. As a brainless action flick, it's very well made. The crane chase, no matter how implausible, was amazing and is easily one of the best chase scenes of the decade. The film's main problem, for me at least, is that it spends it's best action scene too early on in the film, and everything that came afterwards was just OK. Still, it's a good action film, and I believe people have come to respect it more after witnessing the travesty that was Terminator Salvation. Just don't go mentioning T3 in the same breath as it's predecessors.<br/><br/>PROS: <br/><br/>-Crane chase, crane chase, crane chase! Brilliantly set up and shot, and incredibly thrilling. This is the one point where T3 almost matches the heights of the first two films, and what it SHOULD be remembered for. Yes, it is highly implausible, but that's not the point.<br/><br/>-Arnold is amusing, almost playing a parody version of his previous Terminator roles. You can tell he had fun.<br/><br/>-Kristanna Loken makes for a good villainess. She doesn't even touch Robert Patrick, but she brings enough menace to the table to actually feel like a reasonable threat.<br/><br/>-Ending. I'm not gonna spoil it but it is fittingly dark. Gotta give the director props for not coping out on it.<br/><br/>CONS: <br/><br/>-Nick Stahl. Dull. Flat. Boring <br/><br/>-Claire Danes. Dull. Flat. Boring<br/><br/>-The scale/size and quality of the action scenes following the crane chase took a big nose-dive. They are OK, but that's just it. Only OK does not pass in a Terminator film. I get the feeling that most of the film's budget went towards the crane chase, as everything else feels lackluster by comparison.<br/><br/>-This is the biggest flaw for me. The musical score. Where in the hell did that AMAZING and GOD-LIKE score from T2 go? No, those are not overstatements. T2 literally had one of the greatest scores in film history (Brad Fiedel's masterpiece), and I'm just dumbfounded that the creators of T3 seemed completely oblivious to this fact, because T3 has an almost non-existent score. What actually is there is very flat, dull, and BORING. Why oh why did they not try harder in this department?<br/><br/>In closing, Terminator 3 would have gotten MUCH more praise had it not been a Terminator film. 7/10 for this entertaining blockbuster."

It would have nuked out its own Requirements to exist by destroying mankind with nuclear weapons. So ""The rise of the machines"" would have been the end of any advanced machine and technological progress on earth.<br/><br/>Instead, in Reality, the growing Power of Machines over Mankind is exercised through shaping Society according to the needs of Machines and Technology, not by simply destroying human Lives.

","Ever since I've seen this in theater and most recently on cable, I thought ""this is just like Michael Bay's films"". And that thought serves me right; T3 is just like Bay's steaming piles, only difference is it's not directed by him. But for some inexplicable reason, the director chose to follow in Bay's footsteps and ends up making this film as if he looked through his anus for inspiration. Was they sleeping together when they made this? I can't say for certain, but maybe if I get or borrow a friend's copy, pop it in my DVD player and turn on ""Director's Commentary"" I may find the answer to that question(and thus will most likely return it back to the store or friend when done with such film). This is one of those films you find at a cheap motel in some seedy part of of a city populated by unspeakable horrors of ""society"". Not a guilty pleasure by any means, but you get the idea.

","Spoiler alert! Please be advised.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 was one of the most elaborate trailers (for Terminator 4) that I've ever seen! They should have cut this film down to twenty minutes, and added the content that they will be using in T4, but then, that would only give them one box office cash-in to look forward to, wouldn't it? (Ignore the fact that there wasn't enough content in T3 to compose a mentally gripping feature).<br/><br/>I can get over the fact that the story had no real point. Do any of the Terminator films really have any mentally or spiritually beneficial message? No. It's not expected from a film about machines that kill people. But it is a frustrating experience to sit through two hours of fluff and exploding cars only to discover that you'll have to wait for T4 in order to get to the action that the T3 trailers promised you.<br/><br/>If you're a die-hard Schwarzenegger fan, and a sucker for the Terminator franchise, and you have a thing for Kristanna Loken, well...you'll probably still be disappointed, but like the droves that delivered a $150 million box office for the film, you'll probably still put yourself through the painful experience, so when it's over, just remember: you were warned.

But True Fans like us treat this Spin-off as a funny Forgettable Crape.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Spoilers******)<br/><br/>""T3"" is the highly anticipated installment in one of Hollywood's most innovative and celebrated franchises, originated by writer-director James Cameron with the 1984 cult hit The Terminator. With the blockbuster 1991 sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Cameron redefined the science fiction/action film hybrid. <br/><br/>This movie was from the minds of John Brancato, Micheal Ferris and Tedi Sarafian. From their story, director Jonathan Mostow raped Cameron's baby, by rechanging the last epic.<br/><br/>A decade has passed since John Connor(Nick Stahl) helped prevent Judgment Day - the day Skynet's highly developed network of machines was fated to become self-aware and destroy mankind. But August 29, 1997 came and went without incident, despite Skynet's twice failed attempts to kill Connor and wage war on humanity. Now 22, Connor lives ""off the grid"" - no home, no credit cards, no phone and no job. No record of his existence. No way he can be traced by Skynet. Until..<br/><br/>Skynet's most sophisticated cyborg killing machine T-X(Kristanna Loken) sent back through time to complete the job left unfinished by her predecessor, the T-1000. And she is exponentially more powerful, dangerous, destructive and beautiful than every Terminator that has come before her. <br/><br/>But this time, Connor isn't the only target on Skynet's hit list - unsuspecting veterinarian Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) will see her distant past and promising present collide with an unimaginable future. When Connor and Kate realize that Judgment Day is rocketing toward them - with only three hours between them and the end of the world - their only hope for survival is a replica of the cyborg Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) Connor's mysterious - and now obsolete - former assassin. Together, they must forestall the looming threat of Judgment Day or face the fall of civilization as we know it.!<br/><br/>By watching this piece of disaster I thought, for what reason this happened? Did Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna get more Greedy this time? Or Arnold wanted a Cinematic boost before his political debut?<br/><br/>First of all absence of James Cameron in every sense. His characters were treated badly, the Terminator punch lines were now reduced for comic relief, his visionary world turned upside down. <br/><br/>The soul of the movie was seen as a big round hole when it comes to music. The absence of Brad Fiedel, in which the classic ""Clank"" sound gives the signature of Terminator, is thrown out in this version. The new replacement for Fiedel (Marco Beltrami) was the worst part after Mostow.<br/><br/>Without Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, or even William Wisher Jr. (Cameron's co-writer) director Jonathan Mostow managed to bring a Science Fiction tale in a greater level and fails miserably. The early draft storyline was John Connor as a successful computer programmer, who ends up being instrumental in the activation of Skynet. <br/><br/>Nick Stahl tried his best to bring up the matured John Connor who transformed as savior of the world but was not convincing. The Strength of all Terminator movies was that they had a strong villain but this one break that rule. The neither TX character nor Kristanna Loken has the charisma of the Dark Force which was portrayed powerfully by Robert Patrick & Arnold in the Original movies.<br/><br/>The only strength to the movie was Arnold himself even though he agreed to do this lame chapter. Please don't do another Terminator movie!<br/><br/>I give this movie 0 out of 10.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines = Terminator For WHAT ?"

Where were they when Skynet took over? Everybody is getting killed and there are no soldiers anywhere to be found. No security whatsoever.<br/><br/>Then, why did Connor leave the base? That's where Skynet is based and they could have just blown up all the mainframes and put a stop to Skynet.<br/><br/>I don't even get how Connor gets killed in the future. Does anybody actually understand the circumstances surrounding his death? It was not properly explained.<br/><br/>None of this makes sense. It was a poorly made movie and as Cameron said, Terminator is a movie of the 90's. We've seen it all before and if they were going to make a sequel, they should have made one that made sense.<br/><br/>

I'm glad I didn't see it at the theater. Most of the chase scenes are rather boring since it's nothing new.  And the new TX doesn't do a lot of cool stuff. Plus, this movie was made like a pg-13 film. There were only a couple of scenes that made it an R. The terminator films are R movies because they have blood and violence. In T3, there is a lot of violence from machine guns, but the only real blood involves the TX sticking her arm through a cop while he's driving.<br/><br/>There is a cameo from the doctor at the psych ward in T2. He just runs off when he sees Arnie. There was so much potential for a big laugh there, but we didn't get it.<br/><br/>And the way Arnie dies here is so uneventful as compared in T2. In T2 it was moving, but we don't even see him die on screen here. The ending does set itself up for a sequel that has a lot of potential, but they don't need to make it if James Cameron won't do it.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you are someone just dying to know what happens next in the terminator series, than check it out.

","A ""Terminator"" film without writer-director James Cameron seemed doomed from the start and sadly the prediction would ultimately become a reality. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" picks up several years after the events of the second film and John Connor (Nick Stahl) has become little more than a nomad, constantly moving around because of the fact he does not feel safe anywhere. Even though everything was supposedly solved at the conclusion of ""Terminator 2"", Stahl cannot help but feel that danger still looms. He is of course right as a new terminator (in the form of the strikingly beautiful Kristanna Loken) comes into the picture and chaos strikes. Naturally Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as a re-programmed terminator sent from the future to protect Stahl at all costs. Also along for the ride is engaged veterinarian Claire Danes who has an important role to play in the future. Skynet (ran by David Andrews, who is also Danes' father) is still the governmental entity that must be stopped, altering the future for good. ""Terminator 3"" struggles the whole way through and nearly won me over anyway with fast-paced action and clever one-liners. However, the direction by Jonathan Mostow (a film-maker who does not hold a candle to Cameron) is never very clear and the writing staggers throughout. The final moments of the production are a huge downer too and it is made blatantly clear that there is always a chance for more installments. I was very close to giving ""Terminator 3"" a marginal thumbs up, but the ending was such a mess that it soured me on that notion.

James Cameron is out and Jonathan Mostow is in.Mostow actually pulled it off!His direction was very good and I think the project was directed right.How Cameron would have directed and handled this new Terminator movie is unknown.I do hope there will be a sequel with the same cast.I think what I said above about it not being special is because I only saw it once.Overall it had plenty of fights between the Terminators and in the action scenes there was so much damage with chase scenes and it was never boring that I think it should satisfy most Terminator fans and even if your not a Terminator fan but love Arnold and action movies I think you should give this a look! I strongly recommend it!<br/><br/>I bought the movie Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and in My opinion its is just as good and action packed as the other two. This one has a whole bunch of incredible action! Arnold was great! Nick Stahl and Claire Danes were good! I really liked Danes! Kristanna Loken was awesome as the T-X Terminatrix! She was the perfect choice to play this great villain! I hope to see this awesome looking woman in more action films in the near future! David Andrews and Earl Boen were good. The music by Marco Beltrami is excellent an is arguably the greatest score ever composed in My opinion! If you like Arnold and the other Terminator films and have not seen this movie then don't rent but buy this immediately because I strongly recommend it!<br/><br/>Movie Nuttball's NOTE:<br/><br/>Watch the the end credits for the original Terminator theme performed by Marco Beltrami! Also plays the cool song called ""The Current"" performed by The Blue Man Group featuring Gavin Rossdale! Its an excellent song!"

","Terminator 3 (2003) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>With Judgment Day looming, another Terminator (again played by Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) who is now a pill taking junkie. The two must also protect another woman (Claire Danes) from a new form of killer in the T-X. This third film in the series gets mostly mixed reviews but I found it to be the perfect way to end the original series and a great way to start up the battle of the future. The movie has some flaws in it but overall this is everything a summer blockbuster should be. We get some nice characters, good laughs and plenty of non-stop action but we also get a good story thrown in as well. I do think the story is a step down from the previous film but then again so is everything in this movie. It certainly doesn't live up to the previous film but not too many can so that's not a reason to bash this one. In terms of action this thing is a homerun as we get one great sequence after another. The highlight of the movie has to be the crane sequence where Schwarzenegger gets attached to it and they make for some great damage. This entire sequence is jaw dropping and really packs a terrific punch in terms of action. I also loved what they did with the ending. I certainly won't ruin what happens but I thought it was handled in a very good way and didn't pull any strings. The one flaw in the movie is Stahl and Danes. Both are fine actors and both are fine here but to me we needed people a little stronger or perhaps their characters should have just been written better. Schwarzenegger is in good form and has plenty of nice one-liners as well. I'm not sure if this will ever gain the classic status of the previous two films but it's a good way to end the original series and we'll just have to see what the future films, taking place in the future, holds."
"SilverCentri2009","5","1","4","18 April 2020"," So much potential that went unfulfilled
","Since I first saw this movie in theaters back in the summer of 2003, I've had mixed feelings about it since then. For many years, I thought it was great, not as good as the first two, but good enough on its own. Granted, when I first saw it, I had only recently watched the original two films so I was not a hardcore fan of the Terminator franchise at that point. As the years went on, I began to better appreciate the quality of the first two films, and unfortunately, Terminator 3 really lost it's shine. There were some good parts but they were far few in between nods to the first 2 movies and goofy humor that did not work with this film, given the circumstances taking place.
In 2004, a decade after the events of Terminator 2, Judgment Day was averted, Sarah Conner is dead, John is a ""living off the grid"" for fear that Terminators may still come after him from the future. And one does. Only this time, he's not the only target. John's future wife, Kate, is also on Skynet's hit list. And she also happens to be the daughter of the guy who oversaw the creation of Skynet. And Judgment Day is also taking place... on the same day.
The problems with this movie is that it had a lot of potential to be great, maybe not greater than Cameron's duology, but close enough to them. But the people behind this film didn't seem to care that much about it. The start of the film is a big hint. They screwed up John's age. In the narration, John says the machines tried to kill him when he was 13. He was 10 in Terminator 2. Judgment is inevitable but there is barely a discussion about it. The whole climax of T2 was based on preventing Judgment Day and the characters just shrug it off. No explanation of how Skynet still came into being, how any of Miles Dyson's research survive when they blew up Cyberdyne, nothing. Judgment Day is happening within hours and the characters don't find out until halfway through the movie. I guess that wasn't important enough to bring up until after the ""talk to the hand"" gag and all the other pointless humor. And that's another thing, the humor was so out of place for this film, especially considering that 3 billion lives are at risk of being wiped out. And this is just to tip of the ice berg.
Now, these could be seen as nitpicks but during the commentary for the film, the director (not Cameron) states that he doesn't know why Terminators arrive from the future naked. This was explained in the interrogation scene in the first Terminator film. The way how the director ignored basic lore established in the previous films makes me furious. How did we end up with people who cared so little about this universe? It's something to this day that still has me shake my head in disappointment. And it's another reason why Salvation has garnered more appreciation (the people working on that movie actually cared about the universe Cameron created).
The character of John Connor was okay, I can find it understandable why they made him the way he was. Kate Brewster was tolerable, I mean was Claire Daines the best actress they could find for the role? And of course, it was great seeing Arnold back as the Terminator even though at this point, his age was very apparent here. Kristina did a decent job as the Terminatrix, though the TX was not as menacing as the T-1000. I was disappointed Linda Hamilton didn't come back as Sarah Conner but when I found out why she refused to be in this movie, I totally understood her decision. She was barely going to be ion it and was going to die and the characters were not going to mourn her. Is it really too harsh to say the people behind this movie didn't care about it, when they were going to write the character who was the heart of the franchise in such an insulting manner.
There were some good parts such as some of the action scenes. But a lot of those were underscored by the badly placed humor. And the movie did not have the gravity of the previous films, even though there was much more at stake in this film. Even though it came out over a decade after T2, T3 has aged worse. It feels like a made for TV movie than a feature film. The ending was the best part. It was a good shock and great setup for a sequel. If only 90% of the movie was just like it.
What should have been a great addition ended up being a forgotten, lackluster entry in a dying franchise."

","(12/29/2019). For me, this is the 2nd worst film in the entire 6 volume ""Terminator"" films. If you go by numbers, only ""Terminator Genisys"" (2015), is the absolute worst, simply because the crew & director took it completely seriously. It is absolutely woeful. On the other hand, this film is far too comical. For me, I like the original film the most. It was made in 1984. This was a time when James Cameron had very few resources. However, as a result of the commercial success, 2 years later he released ""Aliens"" (1986); the sequel to Ridley Scott's brilliant 1979 film (""Alien""). Highly successful commercially, plus Sigourney Weaver got a ""Best Actress"" Oscar nomination. 3 years later he made the most commercially successful of all the ""Terminator"" films with ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" (1992). For Cameron, the rest is history. Next came this film, then (the 4th) ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009) which was very well cast (but no Arnold!), plus it had a decent script. Then the aforementioned (horrible) 5th film, ""Terminator Genisys"" (2015). Finally, after 3 different directors had poor to mediocre success, James Cameron returns to this genre. It is after he has made ""Titanic"" (1997) and Avatar"" (2009). Only now he has both Arnold Schwarznegger and Linda Hamilton in the 6th (and hopefully last) film in this series with ""Terminator: Dark Fate"". It was just released (Nov. 1, 2019) to mixed reviews. Regardless, this film has a few decent moments. I do like Arnold, Nick Stahl and Claire Danes. Also, it gave Kristanna Loken a big break."

","The third movie of the Terminator Saga was not directed by James Cameron anymore but Jonathan Mostow. The movie also changed its studio from Metro Goldwyn Mayer into Warner Bros. Pictures.<br/><br/>It is a lot like the second movie: Judgment Day. A terminator was sent to kill John Connor again. The last movie we had T- 1000 and then it's T-X, a completely new terminator. After dying in Judgment Day, T-800 had returned and took some punk clothes and sunglasses, just like the first two. It should change I think.<br/><br/>Everybody loved to see a terminator movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger and he made his third debut in the third movie. However, I wasn't impressed with the plot that T-800 wasn't a series 101 but a different one, a protagonist with a dark and strict character. He forgot everything John taught him in Judgment Day: the smile, Hasta La Vista Baby and more. I was really disappointed with that fact. John Connor wasn't played by Edward Furlong anymore, the role changed to Nick Stahl, who had been known for being in Sin City (2005). The performances weren't as good as the previous two but they weren't terrible. Schwarzenegger wasn't trying his best for the third movie so I think the best performance here was Nick Stahl's John Connor. He was excellent making the character Katherine Brewster played by Claire Danes agreed to be on their side. It's great to see the two together.<br/><br/>The really big problem here was T-800. He knew too much and he kept predicting futures. It's not necessary to or maybe he shouldn't say it. It's like spoiling a movie with great contents. T-800 said the two got married, John would be terminated in 2032 and more things that we wouldn't want to be spoiled. When T-800 revealed when John Connor dies, it was the stupidest thing to say. And it got worse when T-800 revealed the killer,...him. I called this the biggest issue in this movie. It's really terrible and I hate it! See, that's why this one's the least popular of the Terminator Saga based on IMDb (6.3/10).<br/><br/>However, I don't hate the other parts of the movie, they were good. The CGI was okay and so was the cinematography. The action sequence were epic and instead of saying his words (Hasta La Vista, Baby) to kill T-X, T-800 said: ""You are Terminated!"". That would explain that T-800 completely forgot about what John had taught him in Judgment Day.<br/><br/>It's not one of the bests in the Saga, but it wasn't too bad. I'm looking forward to see more: Terminator Salvation, Terminator Genisys and Dark Fate. I'm starting to like this franchise.<br/><br/>Ratings: 6.8/10"

"MaximumMadness","5","1","4","2 February 2017"," ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines""- A soulless retread of previous films, but still fairly entertaining.
","Sometimes, a series just isn't meant to continue. After delivering a solid and exceptionally well-made Sci-Fi thriller with 1984's ""The Terminator"", director James Cameron followed it up with one of the greatest action films ever made with his 1991 sequel ""T2: Judgment Day."" But it would be twelve long years before a third film in the iconic franchise. Twelve years of rumors and speculation and hopes and dreams on the part of film-goers the world over. But when details on the production of ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" started to emerge, fans grew noticeably (and rightfully) concerned. Especially with the loss of series creator Cameron, here replaced with director Jonathan Mostow and a small army of screenwriters.<br/><br/>Would it live up to the long-building hype? Could it come even close to matching the essentially perfect quality of the previous films? Would it be another great installment in the franchise?<br/><br/>Well, despite an upfront warm reception from critics and general audiences, the answer to these questions in retrospect is sadly a resounding ""No!"" While ""Terminator 3"" is far from being a terrible film, it's unfortunately a painfully generic and often soulless retread of the far superior second chapter, filled to burst with contrived winks and nods tossed in to win over fans... but never feeling necessary or even particularly fulfilling. Yes, it is entertaining enough to warrant a one-time viewing. But on the whole, it's just a prime example of an unneeded continuation to a perfect and self-contained tale.<br/><br/>We pick up some time after the previous tale, as John Connor (Nick Stahl) has grown paranoid about his future, and lives ""off the grid."" However, he is forced to face his possible destiny as a savior of mankind once again when a new Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arrives from the future to protect him from another threat- the T-X (Kristanna Loken), a new model that combines liquid metal with an endoskeleton armed to the teeth with future-weaponry. At the same time, a mysterious computer virus is striking all over the world, and the military contemplates using the newly-completed Skynet system to eradicate it, not knowing the power that Skynet has and the destructive consequences its activation would cause.<br/><br/>To give the film credit, there are some elements at play that do indeed work. Schwarzenegger is a joy as always, and it's a blast seeing him reprise what is perhaps his most well-known and beloved role on- screen. The rest of the cast plays their roles well, and there isn't really any sore thumbs. Mostow also delivers some genuinely thriller sequences of action and adventure, including a phenomenal and wildly explosive car-chase early on that still holds up well to this day and is one of the best sequences of the entire franchise. I also thought that despite not quite matching the high- bar set by ""Judgement Day"", newcomer composer Marco Beltrami does an adequate and admirable job with the film's score. He gets the tone quite well, and while his themes are never as memorable as Brad Fiedel's prior work, it gets the job done with style.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some great action and performances can't really overcome the biggest issue, which is that this is a really bland and blatant inferior copy of what's come before. Too much of the film is devoted to just trying to match the last film beat-for-beat, to the point it feels borderline condescending. To try and avert this, Mostow and the writers pepper in comedic subversions, but they just feel contrived at best. (Do we really need to see Arnold wearing a male-strippers ""Star Sunglasses"" as a gag?) The film feels without soul or identity because it plays it far too safe for its own good. And thus it can be tedious to sit through on a second or third viewing.<br/><br/>There's also just a slew of issues I have regarding the general writing and production. The film's pacing is a bit of a mess, and key segments feel left out and poorly established. The idea of the villain being a female Terminator is fascinating and could work, but Loken comes across as miscast looking back. She lacks menace and plays the role a bit too ""sexy."" (They really needed someone like a Lucy Lawless or an Uma Thurman in this role.) And it lacks the polish of Cameron's work with flat cinematography and sometimes uninspired choices in shots and composition.<br/><br/>Still, it's not a total loss. The story is just solid enough to be worth checking out, the action is great and it's good fun seeing the Terminator back in action. It's not a great film, but ""Terminator 3"" also isn't objectively terrible. I say give it a shot once if you're curious, because there is some definite fun to be had. But I'd mainly suggest just sticking to the first two.<br/><br/>I give ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" a mediocre 5 out of 10."

","The first 'Terminator' was basically a sci-fi slasher flick. Dark, relentless and scary. The second one was more cerebral and polished, trading terror for white-knuckle action. 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' is merely a generic summer popcorn movie. The script is thin, recycling old ideas without any of the careful craft that Cameron originally put into them. Also missing is the crucial relationship building that gave the first two films their heart.<br/><br/>Arnold returns, looking remarkable for a man in his late 50s, but his Terminator here lacks the cold menace of the original or the sly wit of his 'T2' counterpart. Nick Stahl is surprisingly effective as John Conner, but his character is unfortunately underwritten. ""Heroine"" Claire Danes mostly just screams and villain Kristianna Loken is nothing but eye candy as the eye-rollingly named Terminatrix.<br/><br/>Though it breezes by at a fast clip, 'Rise of the Machines' is a weak and uninspired successor to the two legendary originals."

"robotbling","1","1","4","12 December 2011"," True Terminator fans will HATE this movie
","(www.plasticpals.com) Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the best sci-fi action movies ever made. It was a perfect blend of all the right ingredients: a gripping story; spectacular action scenes; bleeding-edge special effects; and it managed to spin on its head the age-old adage that a sequel cannot, by definition, outdo the original. James Cameron made a masterpiece, and I doubt you would disagree. So when Terminator 3 was announced – and that James Cameron would not be directing – alarm bells started ringing.<br/><br/>James Cameron had already proved with Aliens that a sequel to a great film by a different director can actually work. So it's not like Terminator 3 had to be bad – but unfortunately, it is. Sarah Connor, the 2nd most important character in the series next to the Terminator, doesn't appear in the film. T3′s excuse for Linda Hamilton's non-participation is that Sarah died of cancer a few years before the events of T3. If this is true, who is going to train John to become the leader of the resistance? The John we see in T3 isn't Edward Furlong (who wisely passed on the role), it's Nick Stahl, and he doesn't seem prepared to lead a revolution against Skynet at all. He's a total loser who basically ""lives off grid"" to protect his anonymity in the event another terminator comes back to kill him. And it's made clear from his complete lack of reflexes, let alone military skills, that he hasn't spent his time on the edge of society wisely if there's an apocalypse coming.<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger reprises his role of the T-800, and who can blame him? Well, I do. I blame him because if he hadn't signed on to this trainwreck it probably wouldn't have gotten financed to begin with. Arnie's return for one more milking at the cash cow was a disgrace. His adversary is a female dominatrix terminator called the T-X, played by Kristanna Loken.<br/><br/>Kristanna LokenShe's sexy, but her athleticism is a bit too obvious for the part – ironically, Claire Danes would have made a more interesting casting choice. Besides the fact that the T-1000 was a much better (and seemingly more advanced) villain, the idea of a female terminator is wasted on this film. She isn't even liquid metal, which would lend itself nicely to the sanguine female form (as evidenced by Dural from SEGA's Virtua Fighter), and would lend weight to the idea that a smaller, more agile model could tango with the lumbering lugnuts T-800 model.<br/><br/>Instead, Claire Danes gets caught in T3′s web of fail as John's would-be girlfriend, Kate Brewster. In an unbelievable coincidence, Kate happens to be the daughter of the military commander of Skynet. And the guy who penned that has the audacity to call himself a writer! Terminator 3 also delights in taking a giant dump all over the hopeful optimism of the first two films. A recurring idea in the first two stories is that the future is not set. No fate but what we make. This concept is destroyed in T3 when we are shown that regardless of the characters' actions Judgment Day is inevitable.<br/><br/>If this was just some throw-away action movie I wouldn't care that much, but as a kid who saw T2: Judgment Day at around the same age as John Connor in that film, it left a lasting impression on me. T3 has no excuse to suck. It could have been a bullseye but it completely misses its target, shooting itself in the head. Do yourself a favor and forget this film ever existed."

I'm trying to force myself with mental back-flips into somehow making this movie not the worst film I had ever seen. The only thing good this film did was judgment day. But, that would have served better as a two or three minute prologue to T4 and T4 could have been T3 and things would be much better.<br/><br/>(Judgment day was pro-longed but not stopped, now to the movie.) The movie tries to be funny, and falls on its face by taking treasured scenes and turning them into half-baked and crappy jokes. It tries to change storyline, in all the wrong ways. Everything feels forced. You almost wish that Arnold will stop talking because everything he says just destroys any sense the previous two movies every made. (Not that they were perfect; but T3 took 'creative liberties' to an obscene level where they were pulling crap out of their butt left and right and not even checking if it had any dramatic reason to be there, make fans happy, or even make any sense.) The took my child-hood hero that was emotionally strong and turned him into a whiny a** drug addict. I grew up watching T2 and playing with T2 toys sense I was about five. As I got older, I saw John as a role model of emotional maturity; someone with strong leadership skills that I would someday want to be.<br/><br/>Now he's a whiny little b**ch for some reason that has never really been explained. He never was before. Had no reason for becoming. It's not like he was unstable and this was in the cards. Of all the characters in T2, T1 even, he was the most emotionally mature and most level headed; even talking his mom down from killing a man.<br/><br/>Now? Now he'd go pop some dog neutering pills and be out for hours. Wow, did the writer have nothing better to do than defecate on my childhood? The Terminator series has always been about making your own fate, your own future. That's how things really work. That is a large part of Spirituality. The movie itself even shows that the future was changed. Skynet was set back, that itself is a change. So why does the film go on and on trying to refute how things really Spiritually work, how they worked in T1, how they worked in T2, and how they work even in this film. It just seems that John was just such a whiny runt that he gave up on saving the future.<br/><br/>I almost wanted the Arnold Terminator to shoot John dead in the movie so he would just stop whining so damn much. Boo hoo, the future, boo hoo, his life sucks, boo hoo. How did John go from emotionally stable leader to emo drug addict thumb sucker? This film felt like those making it took personal pleasure in taking everything the first two films had ever done well, and every way positive they touched my life, and just shredded it.<br/><br/>Part 4 does a great job it trying to put a coherent story back together after 3. I like Part 4, actually. At least it understood what it was supposed to be. But it had two classics to stand up to and a lot of baggage from 3 to deal with. So, I think Part 4 did the best it could considering and I like Part 4 a lot.<br/><br/>As for Part 3, it was just sad."

T3 has nothing to add to them. T2 ends on a positive note, building a fragile hope that the future might not be lost, and T3 smashes it by not only showing that the apocalypse was inevitable all along, and nothing the earlier two movies accomplished amounted to anything, but also shows the nukes flying and the world ending, substituting hope for mindless destruction.<br/><br/>I am constantly revolted that people seem to think this movie is a valid part of the Terminator series. To me it feels like fan fiction, an untrained artist lacking a vision of his own finger-painting his unskilled additions on the Last Supper.

","I went to see this film not expecting much and yet this film still managed to deliver even less that that.  This was by far the biggest let down since Warners let Schumacher loose on the Batman franchise.<br/><br/>Firstly, when did the Terminator films become comedies.  True there were a few jokes in T2, but this was criminal.  From Arnie donning the Elton specs to ""I'm back"" I was cringing throughout this hell.<br/><br/>Next, I know it's impossible to watch a film about time travel without noticing flaws, but this film was beyond the pale such as the fact that Cyberdyne has been destroyed yet the Terminators still resemble Arnie and have the Cyberdyne serial no's.  Plus there were all the classic story flaws such as the TX being a vast improvement on the t-1000.  OK, I might be wrong but she seemed to take a beating, from her weapon malfunctioning to being crushed by a helicopter (the T-1000 walked away unscathed from a helicopter crash in T2).<br/><br/>I don't mind a few plot points being delicately nudged into a film, but this was shocking.  Where did Arnie's explosive cells come from.  Surely this would have been a hazard when he dropped into the lava at the end of T2. My favourite by far, though, was Clare Danes shouting, ""it's my father's plane, I trained in it"".  Phew what a relief, if she hadn't they never would have made it to the thrilling finale.<br/><br/>All in all this was a shocker, from the stilted screenplay to the shocking filming (no need for slow-mo every scene Mostow).

James Cameron, co-writer and director of those first two, knew right away how to do the action sequences, how to make them exciting, and even how to top himself in the sequel.  But what he was keen on was the story, the characters- for a world such so hard-edged and desolate as in these films, the overall humanity has to be all the more noticeable in order to feel for the main players.  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was made without anything to do with Mr. Cameron, and because of that there is a slight feeling of aloof, even as Jonathan Mostow and his writers try their best to make an impact on the saga of John Connor and the Machines.<br/><br/>
Here's the good news- the action in this film is still exciting, in the sort of dumbdy-dumb dumb flow of this season of movies, and one of the pleasures of seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger in nearly all of his films is that he can bring a laugh and a grin at the most dire of sequences, not to mention his catch phrases (some are corny ""She'll be back"", others are amusing ""Talk to the hand"").  And the new Terminator (T-X), played in a strikingly impervious and sensual efficiency by Kristina Lokken, is a good counterpart for the model 101.<br/><br/>The bad news is that there isn't as much to take in as far as interesting new roles and situations and such, the dialogue revels in cliches instead of juggling around with them as in the other 2, and the actors who play them aren't the wiser- Claire Danes as Kathryn Brewster is convincing to a point, pushing the thankless boundaries of the helpless maiden; Nick Stahl's Connor looks and acts as much like Edward Furlong as Jodie Foster looks and acts like Julianne Moore, and the purpose for Earl Boen's Dr. Silbermen is purely for gag value at this point.<br/><br/>The story-line takes us in this chapter as that this is the new Judgment Day, with Sky-Net on a roll to domination.  Fair enough, but the writers don't overcome any of the subtle, and not so subtle plot-holes.  For instance(s), after the Terminator goes out of the funeral parlor with the casket, gets shot at by bullets that don't leave a mark on him (which did in the last films), he shoots back and explodes some cop cars and then reading on his monitor that there wasn't one human casualty.  The reasoning for the Terminator not committing any human casualties worked in part 2 since young John Connor made him swear not to kill anyone, and in this one it isn't the same Terminator as in that one, so why is he still an ""anti-terminator terminator""?  For an R-rating there is something fishy about Arnold as a semi-pacifist trapped inside of a cybornetic organism.  And Sarah Connor dying of leukemia in 1997 will be a bit of a contradiction as to what's mentioned in the T2 book.<br/><br/>And yet, these I suppose are my problems with such a film, and I can guess I am probably not the only one with them.  Indeed even the most shallow of movie-goers will see this is the least effective of the three in the now Terminator trilogy.  But for this summer's crowd of movie-goers, being fed the assembly line of sequels and re-fashionings of part efforts, it's certainly not indigestible, and it may keep some hoping for a part 4.  As Mr. Connor says in the film, ""there is no fate but what we make of it"". Grade: B"

","This movie was so not worth a watch.<br/><br/>Summary: We speed up in time and join the loner John Connor, now an adult unaware that his time is approaching to take control of his life and the lives of others to survive judgement day. A new terminator, the TX has been sent back to destroy all those who were commanding officers under John Connor, but John, along with the help of an allied terminator go on a rescue to save his future wife from being killed by the new improved terminator TX and to stopping judgement day.<br/><br/>The ending is not what you would expect, the new TX was very cool although she had 2 lines in the whole movie and as for the rest of the cast, Arnie is back butt naked again as the allied terminator, but apparently isn't the same one that died before... he's a new one and he only takes commands from Kate Brewster... John Connor's future bride, but the kids here have some history, which Kate keeps bringing up at odd times. The first Terminator movie rocked, the 2nd one rocked more but the 3rd one rolled over and died. The only highlight is the new TX, who is described by a close friend of mine as being ""hot"". I've rated this a 4 out of 10, but just barely."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","5","28 June 2015"," An Unrefined, Unimpressive & Unnecessary Addition To The Terminator Saga.
","An unrefined, unimpressive & unnecessary addition to the saga that was fully told by James Cameron in the first two films, Terminator 3: Rise of Machines arrives as the second sequel to an already finished series that tries to kill the validity of a highly influential franchise & succeeds to a certain extent, and remains one of the most disappointing sequels in cinema history.<br/><br/>Following the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the story of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is set in the year 2004 in which Skynet once again sends another Terminator back in time to kill the future high-ranking members of human resistance after it is unable to locate the position of John Connor while a reprogrammed T-850 model arrives from the future as a protector of John & his future wife, Kate.<br/><br/>Directed by Jonathan Mostow, Terminator 3 is an insipid, stupid & inferior sequel that lacks everything which made its predecessors two of the most groundbreaking films in the genre of action & sci-fi. The screenplay is marred by its poor storytelling, dull dialogues, complete lack of depth, terrible characterisation, forgettable villain & soulless action, which gets even worse with the lifeless performance its cast puts up.<br/><br/>Despite the advancement in filmmaking technology over the years, its technical aspects are no match to the first two chapters of the franchise. Camera-work is all over the place, for it is impressive in a few sequences & absolutely dodgy at other moments. Editing makes the film a tedious affair to sit through, visual effects is highly inferior in comparison & the score by Marco Beltrami isn't that captivating either.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Kristanna Loken & Claire Danes and not one of them manage to leave a lasting impression. Schwarzenegger's character is ineffectively handled, Loken's T-X is a major step back after the indestructible T-800 of the first film & the invincible T-1000 of the second while Stahl & Danes are very mediocre in the roles of John Connor & his future wife Kate, respectively.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is one sequel that had no reason to exist other than to dent the legacy of the remarkable universe its first two films created. It only goes on to show just how vital James Cameron's input was to this series & without his vision, it's just another cashgrab sequel trying to milk out the franchise for all its worth. The film sure has a couple of stunning moments but for the most part, the process of sitting through Rise of the Machines feels wholly redundant. Worth skipping."
"MovieAddict2016","7","1","5","21 July 2003"," Coming from a sick fan who's been waiting a minimum of five years to see this film, let me tell you...it doesn't disappoint!
","A little low-budget film named ""The Terminator"" hit the streets in 1984. This extremely low-budget actioner was about a machine ""terminator"" sent back in time to assassinate, or ""terminate"" the soon-to-be mother of the future world resistance leader, who would fight back against Skynet's machines who would fight for their dominance of the earth.<br/><br/>19 years later, and one sequel later, comes ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" the massive differences between the original film being the budget, special effects, and action pieces. Being a long-time ""Terminator"" fan, of both ""T1"" and ""T2,"" I can tell you this baby don't disappoint. I have been one of those nerds on the Internet who had an old desktop wallpaper that said ""T3: Summer 2002"" on it. I have been waiting for this flick for years and years and years, a minimum of five years at least. When production finally started, and was delayed to 2003, and started again, I held my breath and expected the best. After the trailer I expected the worst. Now I got the best. This film blows you away, it's the best sequel of the year and James Cameron's absence from the film, though visible, doesn't hinder it.<br/><br/>Judgment Day never happened. The world never got hit by nuclear bombs, the machines took over, and now a twenty-something John Connor lives ""off the grids,"" with no home, no telephone, no nothing. Just in case the machines happen to take over one day in the future and try to assassinate him again.<br/><br/>Of course, the machines DO come back again, as without them there would be no sequel. One is a sexy terminator called the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), whose mission is to assassinate John Connor's future lieutenants and his future wife, a current veterinarian, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), since the machines can't find where John Connor is (that's where the off-the-grid stuff comes in handy for him). However, John Connor happens to meet up with Kate Brewster the same night the TX tries to kill her (and now him since he is a primary target for termination), but the T-800 model cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is also back to protect them, who has been sent back in time by Kate Brewster in the future after the protection cyborg murdered John Connor...in the future, that is...err...confused yet?<br/><br/>Wow, what a thrill ride. Give me a moment to catch my breath. Action non-stop throughout, great special effects, everything. It's nowhere near as great as the first two films, but as far as summer sequels go, this ranks in as one of the best.<br/><br/>Arnold is back in fine form after ""End of Days"" (I liked ""The 6th Sense"" and ""Collateral Damage""), and for a brief moment in the film (when he throws Kate into the back of a truck), the way he is outlined against the night sky makes him look just like he did in the first film. His haircut is very much the same in that shot. Anywho, he's back.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl takes over for druggie Edward Furlong in this installment, and by George he is great! Claire Danes doesn't do much but scream and run around and look pretty, but there's more purpose for her being there than in most movies like this.<br/><br/>Like I said before, James Cameron's absence from the film IS visible, but new director Jonathan Mostow does a great job of taking over from him. The film is lacking some of the human elements that made the first so great, and it feels more like a regular action blockbuster than the predecessors. ""T2"" set a new level for action films; ""T3"" is more of a follower than a revolutionary film such as the first two. The special effects are impressive, but just like all the other films out there nowadays. ""T3"" in no way is as vicious, dark, or amazing as the first two films, which are both some of my favorite films, but Jonathan Mostow has done a great job handling Cameron's baby, and it shows, making ""T3"" neither disappointing nor bad; it's the best film of the summer, and one of the best action films in a long line of dull flicks. <br/><br/>And in conclusion, I can honestly say that he'll be back. Trust me. So stick around. When he's back, I'll be back. But for now, hasta la vista, baby.<br/><br/>4/5"
"mynystry","2","1","6","6 September 2017"," They tried, and they failed
","For some reason I didn't watch this until now, I knew it was crap.<br/><br/>I only give them one extra star because actually they COULD have done a decent film; They somehow made up a story that could have worked out. But they were not able to execute it in a decent way.<br/><br/>Hey idiots, it is the rise of the machines, the end of the world... The director couldn't nail it, he fell very, very short to the challenge."
"Idiot-Deluxe","3","1","6","26 March 2017"," Yeah, because everything after T2 is just great. And here's where it began.
","Arnie was ill-advised to make this one.... if logic or integrity meant anything that is.<br/><br/>When it comes to The Terminator franchise, it's like this: No James Cameron = No Good..... and one of them doesn't even have Arnold!<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, the third chapter in the Terminator saga (which should have NEVER been made in the first place) hit the theaters in the summer of 2003, a whole twelve years after Terminator 2: Judgement Day (the best Terminator movie) and not surprisingly it predictably proved to be a very disappointing sequel. But why? First of all the whole premise of the movie seems forced and illogical, if you're at all familiar with the ending of the second film, the very existence of a third Terminator film is absolutely nonsensical. But at the time (the 2000's) most of Arnie's movies were bombing, so in a forced and desperate effort to reverse his sagging box-office appeal, he decided to play his last remaining ace card: The Terminator franchise. And why not, it had always reaped glowing results in the past, however, James Cameron wisely and with clear-headed logic wanted nothing to do with a third Terminator movie. Evidently the director of the first two films hadn't forgotten how the second film ended, but it's star obviously had. And I must say for a physically demanding role like The Terminator time is not an ally; yet Arnold took twelve years off between T2 and T3 and another 12 years between T3 and Genisys..... rust is forming on the Terminator.<br/><br/>Let's briefly recap the events of the end of Terminator 2, in the films finale through the actions of John and Sarah Conner, Miles Bennett Dyson and a certain re-programmed T-101, every existing scrap of technology that the franchise is based upon (i.e. Terminators of various models and Skynet) was utterly destroyed when the Cyberdine Building was blown up in a massive explosion; and thus effectively erasing the cause of Judgement Day from existence thereby preventing - The War Against The Machines. Which also at the same time should have logically ruled out any possibility of another sequel. BUT, according to this movies logic, none of that happened... and the best reasoning they could come up with was ""You only postponed it, Judgement Day is inevitable"" and then Arnie proceeds to back up his illogical reasoning with some additional drivel about more Terminator's being sent back in time, that are programmed to seek out and terminate certain people who would eventually go on to become military officers in the future, during The War Against The Machines..... but we.... in the second film.... oh never the hell mind!<br/><br/>To be fair and seeing as how this is a Terminator movie there are a few great action scenes, but the films poor casting (in the roles of John Conner and Katherine Brewster) and it's aforementioned ludicrous plot doom it from the get go; and as a result T3 is nothing more than huge, disappointing, illogical mess of a movie - which should never had been made. Another of T3's failings is the films pathetically lame attempts at humor of which almost all fall flat. On the other hand one of T3's few bright spots would have to be Kristanna Loken, she is simply terrific in her role as the ""T-X"" (the bad Terminator), I find her overall design to be absolutely stellar. You'd certainly never suspect such a lovely looking lady would be so fiendishly deadly. And there's another thing about our deadly little Terminatrix, does any else think that Kristanna Loken bares a striking resemblance to 90's porn queen Jenna Jameson?<br/><br/>In the end Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a poorly conceptualized sequel and it represents the first (of several) blemish's to a once great franchise. At the heart of the matter, I can easily conclude that T3 and it's other more recent sequels (which are even worse) are the products of illogical thought, that are powered by nothing other than greed - and perhaps a faulty long-term memory. Why else would they keep making these utterly disgraceful POS sequels. ""Dark Fate"" anyone LOL! BOMB!!!<br/><br/>It takes Arnold AND James Cameron BOTH for this to work, the Terminator series ended with the second film, 26 years ago - anything and everything to do with The Terminator beyond that point is nothing but cyber-trash and money motivated box-office greed.<br/><br/>Stick to the first two films, they're more memorable and ""more better"" in all ways possible."
"dbruce-89348","2","1","6","2 August 2015"," Not true to the original creator's vision
","Okay this movie really disregards the previous ones in the series. Terminator 1 & 2 basically said Judgement Day could be prevented whereas this movie basically says it could only be postponed. So what was the point of the first two movies of doing all that fighting against the terminators if it would only lead to Judgement Day getting postponed?<br/><br/>Lines of dialogue where really cheesy, I mean the terminator says to a convenience store clerk who confronts him for shoplifting, ""Talk to the hand."" Seriously. <br/><br/>The film also felt like it was directed by Michael Bay rather than Johnathan Mostow due to all the freaking explosions and other excessive destructive special effects. Yeah I know there's going to be destruction inherently because that's what the war of machines is about but to have all this repetitive focus on it makes it annoying and boring rather than cool and emotion grabbing.<br/><br/>I felt John Conner and Kate Brewster were rather lame characters in this movie, I mean I just didn't feel the awesomeness that they were supposed to portray. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, the plot, characters, and dialogue of the movie SUCKED and didn't hold true to the previous movies. The music, effects were about the only thing that were good."
"alindsay-al","3","1","6","1 July 2015"," a really poor sequel that shouldn't have been made
","after the phenomenal sequel judgement day it took twelve years for the third film in the franchise and I wish it never happened and they should have left it with just the first two films. The premise of this film sees a terminator sent back in time to protect John Connor and his future wife from being killed by a future terminator and also to try and prevent judgement day from truly happening. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the terminator and even though he does an alright job this is not the same performance as the terminator as before. He just seems like he is exhausted at times and can't be bothered and this was the first film where they really started to parody the terminator and make him a joke. They recast John Connor with actor Nick stahl and he just was not a good fit for the character. I understand where the character was he just didn't portray him very well and he didn't develop at all in the film and i never saw him getting closer to the leader of the resistance. Claire Danes is in the film and she is alright in the film and develops in the film with her performance being good. Also the villain the TX was a good villain and the character was perfect as the evil terminator of the film. The story didn't work either with it becoming way too convoluted and to a certain extent it takes away from the previous films. It has some decent ideas but really fails to deliver them and I feel like the characters didn't grow on me that much. The script is awful with the dialogue not hitting with any of the characters and they don't allow the characters to expand and become more interesting like previous films characters. There are some pretty cool action scenes like the truck scene and the church scene but then there are some over the top cgi scenes that just look really bad. Overall this is a poor film that you won't like unless you are a huge terminator fan and very forgiving."

","Terminator 3: Rise of the Stupid Movies. Sorry. I'll behave. Terminator 3 disconnects itself from the path of Terminator and Terminator 2, and goes its own route. This time, its a female terminator. She's much more advanced then the T-1000. She can inflate her chest to any size she wants! CAN T-1000 DO THAT!??? All joking aside, this is a fair but unacceptable shake at the Terminator films, and certainly not the worst one. Dialogue is pretty flat on this one. No quotable lines, nope, not one. Arnold is much less energetic, don't think I didn't notice, and no, don't come up with excuses ""Well, he's old."" It's not an excuse. Maybe they should have made the movie a little closer to T2, now where's your next excuse? The ending seemed generic, almost anti climatic. It doesn't even feel like a Terminator movie to me. And the violence has even been toned down, don't think I didn't notice. Verdict is in. JUDGEMENT DAY! My judgement? Get out of here, Terminator 3. At least its better then Terminator Salvation, I haven't gotten around to watching that one yet. Was the movie so bad that Arnold didn't even show up in it? What about Dark Fate? It couldn't have been THAT bad!!!"
"silverton-37959","4","1","7","12 January 2020"," Almost OK, kind of.
","This is the weakest film of the terminator franchise. Casting Claire Danes ruins it for me, because I can't stand her facial gymnastics. I guess they cast Nick Stahl because Edward Furlong had become a chubby little couch potato by the time this was made. That means that there were only three characters of any substance, since the female terminator wasn't even a presence onscreen.<br/><br/>This film misses by only about a half a mile, since it at least adds a little to the storyline, though many watchers just skip this one and it isn't missed in the overall scheme. Arnie is the only actor in the cast, which really defines just how bad the casting is.<br/><br/>If you're going to binge the entire franchise, you can skip this one and have a better overall experience."
"gaxiola_fk","3","1","7","27 August 2018"," The third part of the terminators
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines by Jonathan Mostow (2003)<br/><br/>Well, we have here the third movie of the franchise, not particularly popular.
This film is like an attempt to continue the story with an economic interest behind, which killed the film.
Despite some good things and details that really wanted to continue the story, the development of it is completely boring. Starting with the plot that is the same as the last movie, is all about sending a terminator back in time to destroy Skynet's future menace and humanity sending another to frustrate Skynet's plan.
About the characters and acting, I don't know if is the script or the actors but any of the characters were engaging than Arnold. John Connor is completely changed from the boy that he used to be in T2, an unafraid and smart kid that challenge the world, the mental change could be justified by his possible future but come on, he would be a world leader. Kate Brewster is a simple vet that got in the middle of the fire, we have to accept that is all a coincidence that she met Connor again; and she is more like a mother than Sarah Connor. Obviously, they both were in different situations. And finally, the T-X, a character with no color, I know that it's a killing machine, and I don't care about her gender but the scenes that she provoked were very random, specially the scene of the destroyer truck.
The action is nothing compared with previous movies and popular action movies, nothing creative that no one will remember.
Despite all that, I like how they finally proceed in this movie to the judgment day, the nuclear war that changed the path of humanity and started the events that started it all.
In conclusion Terminator 3 is an attempt to continue the saga, with a big failure in it, could be that we don't have Cameron directing it, maybe that's what make the substance in the movie. Absolutely not recommended, not even Terminator fans."
"jessegehrig","2","1","7","2 August 2015"," What ever it's called
","Is this the mediocrity we have enshrined? This is a beloved movie, like people saw it and they walked away with the conclusion that T3 was the best of the bunch. It features soul-crushing hollow Schwarzenegger humor, did I do something to deserve that, am I being punished? Relies on special effects because I guess writing is hard? I like how all Terminator movies center around John or Sarah Conner, like there is nobody else who could possibly be involved, every single f*cking movie, John or Sarah Conner. The comic books aren't like that. Yes, there are Terminator comics and yes, they are really good, and by and large none of the comics have much to do with the Conners. Read the comics, skip this piece of sh*t."
"generationofswine","1","1","8","6 August 2019"," An Honest Review
","Well... I kind of feel like giving this 10 stars based on Salvation and, especially, Genisys. I mean, in retrospect, compared to those two, it actually feels like you are watching a really good movie doesn't it?<br/><br/>It has a plot that actually makes sense, and, unlike Genisys, it fits into the greater Terminator story without changing everything just to, well, just to change the entire canon and story for the sake of... what? I honestly don't know.<br/><br/>However, when you compare it to Terminator and T2, it actually seems like you are watching a horrible movie. Nick Stahl was possibly the worst person to play John Conner they could have cast, Sarah Coner is gone (and with her the protagonist everyone loved) and Claire Danes just doesn't seem to know what she's doing in the film.<br/><br/>Not only that, but Stahl comes across as the worst possible leader on earth... and he's the one that is supposed to be the legend that finally beats the machines? Seriously? Him?<br/><br/>It might have been better if the Terminatrix was in it for more than a blink of the eye, but she kind of takes a back seat to everything else that is going on and leaves us wondering why they even added her into the movie.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's not a good film. However, compared to Salvation and the typo, it comes across as a masterpiece."

The jokes aren't funny and they're self referential. The high-speed chases only pause for breath now and then. None of the characters convince, although Claire Danes is a decent actress with strong features a bit too fleshy to qualify as beautiful by Hollywood standards, one of the reasons I find her appealing. And, as I say, she can act too, as she did in Coppola's ""The Rain Maker."" But she has no more of a chance here than any of the other performers, maybe less because her character has been shoehorned into the plot.<br/><br/>The explosions are bigger and better. And why not?

I really believed that it would not be worthwhile, but indeed it is a great sequel. I was afraid that this third part of this excellent story could be as terrible as the sequences of Matrix are, but using state-of-art special effects, lots of action scenes and a good story, it is an excellent entertainment.

"fernandoschiavi","7","0","2","22 May 2020"," ""T3"" represents a clear drop in the series' quality standard, since, despite having good action sequences, it gets complicated whenever the script tries to develop the story
","Twelve years after the release of the classic second film in the franchise, a new adaptation would continue with the main plot after a change in the rights to the franchise. In her divorce from James Cameron, Linda Hamilton asked for the rights to the ""Terminator"" franchise, which she then resold to Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna of the bankrupt Carolco. The duo's new company, C2 Pictures, financed this third film, causing confusion and at the same time expecting fans, as ""The Final Judgment"" was planned to end the story started in the first film. The story even ends with this idea, since Cyberdine (the company where Skynet would be developed) and all the evidence that could lead to new research to develop an intelligent and independent computer system had been exterminated. Curiosity was how the story would be conceived.<br/><br/>Directed by Jonathan Mostow and with only two actors returning, Schwarzenegger and Earl Boen - who makes a brief appearance as Dr. Silberman - the story of the third film takes place ten years after ""The Final Judgment"", with John Connor (Nick Stahl) living nomadically after his mother's death from leukemia, and two exterminators being sent to the past, one to protect John and his future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) and the other to kill future members of human resistance.<br/><br/>Even with good ideas in the action part, the script by John Brancato and Michael Ferris manages to continue the plot of the second film, but it misses by discarding some pillars of the series and by bringing unforgivable holes that take the unit from the series as a whole. The temporal comings and goings always leave immense holes in the best of cinematic fiction scripts. In the case of ""Terminator 3"", there are striking discrepancies. One is especially in relation to the Schwarzenegger Exterminator. After transforming itself into a complex and moving figure in the previous film, the T-800 (now T-850) becomes a mere accessory in this third part, practically becoming an adjunct. There is no sign of chemistry and the dynamic relationship between the cyborg and his protÃ©gÃ©s here - but that is justified because it is a new model. However, the Exterminator acts in a contradictory way: at a certain moment, for example, he clarifies that it is not the same android seen previously, but just another example of the same line (something logical): however, he avoids killing humans and, in a certain scene, opens the hood of a car to look for the keys to the vehicle - two things he had learned in the second film.<br/><br/>In contrast, Kristanna Loken has little impact like Terminatrix: although she has far more resources than previous villains (being able to access the Internet, perform DNA tests and turn her arms into powerful weapons), the cyborg does not act with the same determination unforgiving of the T-1000. The beautiful actress just does what is expected for this type of character and never really threatens the lives of the heroes. Initially, the difference in the plot consists of the mission of T-X, which includes the murder of all the human resistance generals of the future. However, a casual encounter with Connor and Kate Brewster, his future wife, will cause her to pursue him for the duration of the tape.<br/><br/>However, the story of how John Connor has been living in recent years, especially after his mother's death, is an idea that works: traumatized and depressed, the boy is a fascinating character, since the weight of his destiny (and the glory associated with your future leadership) simply prevents you from enjoying the present. He must carry the weight of being someone he is not yet; he must live waiting for his destiny to come true, contenting himself with the mediocrity of anonymity while the future does not arrive. And what is most painful: in order to fulfill his glorious destiny, John must witness the end of the world, which is still a tragic irony of destiny. The subject is, in short, the anxious and sad veteran that his mother was in the previous film - and therein lies the main strength of this new chapter.<br/><br/>Jonathan Mostow is able to present a typical product for large audiences, with a lot of action, electrifying sequences and moments of adrenaline, which leave the viewer unable to breathe, highlighting the chase scenes involving a crane, a fire brigade truck and a car, in addition to the escape from the cemetery where Sarah Connor's tomb was located and, obviously, the entire final sequence inside the government facility where the rebellion of the machines commanded by Skynet against humanity would take place. Still, it is still unfortunate that the best sequence is the chase that takes place at the beginning of the story, since the rest of the projection can never match up in rhythm or tension.
The director manages to recreate this beaten universe with a correct development - there are repetitions within the film itself, such as the two car chases (the first had already become so good, what for a second?) - and good doses of humor (good to know how to laugh) of himself, with quotes and references to previous episodes, such as the T-800 glasses joke at the beginning of the film and the appearance of Dr. Silberman's character, who took care of Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: The Final Judgment (1992) and that makes a small participation this time trying to comfort the young lady), in addition to managing to develop a bold but controversial ending. In general, the script brought the addition of new information about the apocalyptic future of Earth is also welcome, opening up new possibilities for the future of the series, even if contrary to the ideas presented previously.<br/><br/>""Terminator 3"" represents a clear drop in the series' quality standard, since, despite having good action sequences, it gets complicated whenever the script tries to develop the story. This time the T-800 played by Schwarzenegger must protect not only John Connor, but also a certain Katherine Brewster. The reason? She will be Connor's wife and the couple's children 'will be important'. Now, if the leader of humans in the future had already defeated machines, what importance ('historically' speaking) could their children have? And if he has not yet won the revolution, how can his descendants matter to the future if they are still only children? The answer is obvious: this was just an excuse found by the writers to involve Danes' character in the plot and present it as the hero's romantic interest.<br/><br/>So far, so good: despite being mediocre, the ""revelation"" does not compromise the logic of previous films. Unfortunately, however, T3 does not stop there and ends up introducing a series of new concepts regarding Skynet that radically contradict the main elements of the first two chapters - and this is inexcusable, since, in retrospect, it ends up harming its predecessors (for that we should care about the efforts made by Sarah, John and the Exterminator to destroy the Cyberdine building, in ""The Terminator 2"", if we now know that their actions are useless and wrong?). It is also regrettable to see the philosophy of the first two chapters ('There is no destiny - except what we do') being discarded in favor of a vision of ""predestination"", of the inevitability of events, as this, once again, takes us to see the actions of the brave Sarah Connor as a simple waste of sweat. And this is the biggest sin in the third film."

","In the grand scheme of Terminator films, this is the poor relation. It's been panned on various reviewing websites, and to some extent I can see why too - but I don't hate it, in fact if you give it a chance it's actually alright. In this film a new Terminator (T-X) is sent back in time to the past (our present) to complete another mission which will change its present (our future) and bring machines the victory in a war waged against humanity which has been blazing for a long time. John Connor is all grown up and living off the grid so he can't be hunted. While he isn't the intended target this time, he still manages to find himself on the run from the new super advanced T-X Terminator. Teaming up with his future wife Katherine Brewster, he is on his own mission to survive the conflict with the T-X, and to try and prevent the future from happening thus saving humanity.<br/><br/>Some would argue this film raises more issues than it does solve them, but given the chance, and ignoring the numerous issues, this is a decent action film - not brilliant, just decent. The first Terminator film shows what imagination and storytelling, despite having a low budget , can do - a masterpiece. T2 shows what a big budget and a good imagination, despite only a decent story can achieve - another stroke of genius. T3 unfortunately, shows what a big budget but very little imagination and story can achieve - which ultimately doesn't get it to the heights of its two predecessors.<br/><br/>There are times were it tries to give nods to previous films in the franchise, but in doing it once to many throughout the film it becomes a bit of a parody of itself. The cast in the film is decent enough, Arnie looks a little over aged for his role, but who else can you put in that role. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes do alright as the central humans in the film, but poor scripting means there isn't a massive amount to write home about. Kristanna Loken is a bit cartoony as the new terminator, which I'm not sure if it's down to an overuse of CGI on her - but still she is decent enough.<br/><br/>Some of the issues I had included: T800's aren't supposed to be able to learn, yet Arnie's Terminator has learned plenty of new things. How is Skynet operational after John destroyed the core and every trace of previous Terminators. If Skynet can send Terminators back in time, as it has done plenty of times now (5 by my count), why not send an army of them back in time so that they can win this time? Why haven't the US Military got any security at its top secret facility, and more to the point, how can two young adults and their 6ft gun totting robot enter the facility without being accosted? I have plenty more issues, but I getting fed of myself whinging now.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the twist at the end of this film more than I did the journey to get to that point, I enjoyed looking at some of the version 1 killing machines, I enjoyed the nostalgia this film brought. The biggest issue I had though is that this lacked balls, it didn't have attitude, it didn't feel right. I felt like a film for films sake, rather than a film for a great concept. Perhaps this got panned so much because of the great Terminator films which came before it. At best, for me, this is a 6 out of 10."

","Well just like John Connor says ""It was never our destiny to stop Judgement Day"", similarly there was going to be another Terminator movie no matter how nicely the things were brought to a closure in T2. Filmmakers are always waiting to cash on by making unoriginal sequels just to cash on the fame of the original classics. So sick, sequels nowadays are nothing but money grabbing business. I felt relieved when I saw that T2 still grossed more than this unnecessary sequel despite being released way back in 1991.<br/><br/>Plot is again a rehash of T2 which was also a rehash of T1 but with a twist. Still what T2 has and T3 misses is a good story. I liked the concept of the Inevitable Judgement Day in T3 even though it violates the Cameron's closure in T2. Still, the film misses many things that would have made it a likable sequel like T2. One of the strongest character of the franchise Sarah Connor is sidelined from the story which ruined the experience, something like the way 'Alien 3' destroyed the positives of 'Aliens'. Arnold's Terminator character kind of feels more like human than machine. The iconic theme of Brad Fiedel is totally missing till the credits roll, even then again it is not entirely used. The terminator T-X is surprisingly pales in comparison to T-1000 of Terminator 2. The dread and ruthlessness of The Terminator was entirely missing, making the chase sequence more cartoonish than horrific. Well yes that's one thing which became enjoyable in this ride of discontent, some clichÃ©d moments like the truck chase similar to T2 yet less appealing, Arnold putting on pink-star glasses only to find it resenting, etc. Parody and comedy felt like nice breaks in mundane action. The characters of John Connor and Katherine Brewster had some nice potential to built up in the story but no the script focuses more on not the so great T-X. Skynet's rise to become self- aware wasn't explained properly. Also they failed to portray John Connor as an effective leader and Nick Stahl felt completely lost. Even Edward Furlong was able to highlight a better and useful 10- year old John Connor in T2. The CGI isn't much special, almost similar to T2 even though T3 was done in a time of more advanced tech. <br/><br/>The concept of time-travel can be extensively used to churn out repetitive sequels even though the whole thing is riddled with paradoxes. And that's what T3 does. Rise of the Machines feels pathetic in comparison to its predecessors. Still it has some good action sequences. Also I felt the ending was justifiable even though the path taken was disappointing. T3 is never very boring as such, you just have this feeling of pale discontent.<br/><br/>RATING: [2/5]"

","John Connor (Nick Stahl) is a young man living off the grid as a drifter. He is still haunted by nightmares of an apocalyptic future. Future SkyNet sends back T-X (Kristanna Loken) to hunt down various people including Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). She's the daughter of U.S. Air Force General Robert Brewster who is reluctant to activate SkyNet on their system. There is a computer supervirus infecting the world. Another Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arrives to protect John. John breaks into Kate's animal clinic to steal medicine. It turns out that they knew each other as teens before the original Terminator.<br/><br/>This is not bigger and better than the other two. That is its biggest sin in the logic of sequels. It has some good action but it's not bigger than the second one. The car chase is lots of fun especially with real action. It doesn't bring anything new to the franchise. It is merely a continuation. Nick Stahl should have been a good lead. At least, the movie NEEDED him to be good. Instead, he's merely capable. Claire Danes is much better. The standout is Arnold who looks amazing at his age. I didn't particularly like the coincidence of Kate and John being in the same place. The humor isn't as good. The lines aren't as memorable. The plot isn't as well thought out.

"jrhgriffiths","8","0","1","30 April 2014"," Symphony of Steel
","Terminator 3 is a movie that revels in the sheer power of steel, metal, and iron. The action scenes (and the movie is almost one continuous action scene) are like a symphony of metal pounding on metal. The two combatants are advanced killing machines from the future. The T-X's mission is to kill John Connor; the Terminator's to protect him. In carrying out these missions, they pound one another through walls, cars, helicopters, and even toilets. The T-X pursues John Connor in a crane truck, the truck's wrecking ball smashing dozens of cars. The Terminator shoots rocket propelled grenades into the T-X, the grenades blasting her down an elevator shaft. And the sound effects amplify every explosion and clash so that you feel enmeshed in a world of steel.<br/><br/>Perhaps all that sounds like a giddy fanboy's reaction to an action movie. And perhaps that's fair. There's much to criticize here. The human characters are unbelievable. Nicholas Stahl as John Connor doesn't seem like the inspiring hero he will become. Claire Danes as Kate Brewster comes off silly and shy when she should be tough and grimacing. Moreover, the Terminator's one-liners are, well, corny. But this movie is like a heavy metal concert; the lyrics don't really matter."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","28 December 2013"," Doesn't match it predecessors, but a good action film nonetheless
","The first Terminator film is a classic example of an intense action/horror scifi film done just right. Everything is perfect from the bleak setting to the depressing storyline about a future where the machines have taken over and their only salvation is to try and mess with time itself. The second film, also directed by James Cameron, was more of a straight-up action film, but just as great as the original, if not even a bit better. And then there's the third one.<br/><br/>It's not as good as the first two. The lack of James Cameron shows in the lack of vision. It's not as ambitious as the first two, the actors aren't as talented - Schwarzenegger though once again shines in his trademark role, though nothing new about him is uncovered - and the story tries to patch some of the plot holes of the previous movies, but only manages to create new ones in their stead. Even the character of John Connor, played by Nick Stahl, the centerpiece and lynchpin of the entire saga, suffers from being reduced to a whiny little jerk. I much preferred the determined kid of the second movie to this fatalist loser.<br/><br/>That being said, this is still a really good action film. One of the best I've seen in the new century and well worth the price of admission. The movie suffers from the common sequel syndrome of trying to do everything bigger and better, even if it usually ends up jumping the shark, so to speak. However, in this case we get Arnold ""Real-Life Hulk"" Schwarzenegger in his last honest action superstar role, really flashy fight sequences, cool chase scenes and lots of dakka. The hotblooded male in me refuses to regard this as a bad thing. And quite honestly the ending manages to reach some of that bleakness that coloured the first two films and made them so jarringly touching. It's not quite there, but you get hints.<br/><br/>I rated this movie quite high because I honestly think that it's a great action film. If you're looking for a worthy successor to Cameron's Terminator films, this isn't it, not really. It's still quite an enjoyable ride if you're just looking for a thrilling action piece."
"thewillt08","2","0","3","13 July 2013"," Hasta La Vista to this Franchise
","With the brilliance in Terminator one and two there is no way Terminator three can be a disaster, right? It has such a strong foundation it is literally impossible to screw up. Or so I thought, then Terminator Rise of the Machines was made and oh how I wish it never was shown to the public or even to deaf and/or blind children.<br/><br/>There are probably 10-15,000 problems with this movie. I heard it was bad but I went in with low expectations and the first thing I see is the producer and director's names. I couldn't believe it wasn't James Cameron. I thought if James Cameron was involved then it couldn't possibly be that bad but from the title screen I lost a lot of hope. James Cameron is the main reason these movies were a success. He created this story, the characters, and through his vision these movies came to life. Now somebody else is ripping off his work to make a buck and he destroyed this franchise.<br/><br/>Problem number two, the beginning. It is cookie cutter by now to have Arnold appear, naked, and look for clothes and throw some bodies, but now the evil Terminator is a woman. I saw her and I was devastated. I'm not being sexist and saying a female can't be in this role but this a man's movie. An action packed man experience and seeing a girl follow up to the T-1000 was impossible for anybody. She does the exact same thing as the first two with the emotionless stares and few lines. The intimidation factor was down and she wasn't too special or more advanced from the previous model. <br/><br/>In the third installment we revisit the character of John Connor and the way this man turned out was so disappointing. The kid in the second movie was ten times better than this clown. This guy stopped Judgment Day, or so he thought, and he is a coward. He runs and runs in fear. I hated his character and the way he was written. His lines were weak, his acting was weak, and everything about his character was stupid. I thought Sarah Connor would have still taught him to be an intimidating beast, or at least a man. This guy is embarrassing to the supposed to be hero of humanity. On a side note I hate what happens to Sarah. I won't say what happens because I think it is supposed to be a surprise but I was so angry. A character as awesome and dedicated to the story as her deserved better for this film. <br/><br/>The main problem with this story is that it probably should never have been made. I was perfectly happy with the ending if Terminator two. If anything this movie takes away the impact of the previous movie. ""You didn't stop Judgment Day, you delayed it."" That one line ruined everything. Everything done in the second movie was basically for nothing. I would have probably been happier if Arnold was not in this movie. He and John had a strong bond as a kid and when John sees the new Terminator he acts really odd. The chemistry they built up in the previous movie was also for nothing. ""I guess I have to re-teach you everything."" So many things disappointed me in this movie it was hard for me to find any positives. <br/><br/>If I had to say at least one good thing I guess t could be the climax leading to the ending. Skynet is back and we learn a lot more about the beginning of the end. We see the end begin with the fatal mistake and the idea of the impossibility to change the future is still interesting. The last ten minutes or so I had mixed feelings about. They build it up to be something epic and it turns out to be something unexpected. At that point I didn't really care about the ending and I accepted it for what it was. It left off with the strong possibility of another movie, and there is a review will be here soon. <br/><br/>Finally I will touch upon the special effects. Well, they weren't that good. In the beginning there is another crazy car chase with cars flying everywhere and way too much destruction. A car crashes into a wall at high speeds and it somehow explodes. Just because a car crashes into something doesn't mean it has explode. The shots with a Terminator being lit up by round after round of ammunition by cops get old. Every action scene in this movie has been used in a similar or exact same way in one of the previous two films. If I have to play devil's advocate I will say I did love the giant robot inside Skynet tearing apart person after person and everything in its path that was awesome. <br/><br/>Overall, Terminator Rise of the Machines did the impossible. It was almost impossible for this movie to fail and it did on almost every single aspect of a film to fail. There was poor writing, awful characters, and ridiculous action. If the story had to continue anything else would have been better. I am glad I saw this movie at least once just to say I saw the entire franchise to date, I obviously had to watch this before Salvation and Salvation has also been seen, but I will probably never watch it ever again. Before I give it the WillyT rating I hope you noticed I didn't mention the girl in the story. That is probably because I just remembered her. She is awful, adds nothing to the story, also poorly written, and I hated almost everything about her. There that should be enough ranting for one day. This disgrace of a Terminator movie gets the WillyT Seal of DISapproval."

Plus the fact that they went all out sexy on this villain is way too distracting to the male viewer to think of her as a villain. Also, this movie lacked the character development, plot, script, heart, talent, and effort of the first two films. They mostly look like they are trying to do a Michael Bay explosion/no plot kind of film, but hey, at least Michael Bay can entertain! Unlike the first two films, I did not care about the characters, heck one character was so annoying that I didn't care if she died, and could really care less about the whole plot in general.

Honestly, there's no suspense at all, and when the terminators fight -- it's just ridiculous (like the rest of the meaningless ""action"" in this movie"").<br/><br/>T1 was good. T2 was perfect. T3... I'll just keep pretending it never existed."

","2/4<br/><br/>The first two Terminator movies could be called some of the best sci-fi action films ever to be created. The plot and character development was great. They took times to slow down and in a way really impact the characters.But now the sequel to the second one seemed to be nothing more than just a hyped up action film. The movie was a pretty short one but that's only because it had not much time to cool down after all the action sequences.<br/><br/>Even though there are a lot of action scenes they don't seem very enjoyable or amazing like the first ones which really kept you interested. The first two films had a kind of different styles of action from each other. There wasn't much hand to hand combat in the first but had amazing shootouts and suspenseful parts. The second had more like stunts and hand to hand combat scenes with both terminators. But the third tries to use both too much and over does it. This can overwhelm the film and become bored if this is all the movie has."

","Terminator 3, the brave, brave sequel to what is considered by many to be the perfect film, and with that fact alone it was bound to fail. However, was it all bad?<br/><br/>The film does indeed have many good points. The special effect and CGI are superb, crisp, and believable with what looks like early Transformers type effects in there. The action scenes can't be faulted, with the now famous crane scene being a pretty stunning set-piece, and every fight and high adrenaline piece is made with every professionalism. The film has had a lot of money thrown at it, and it shows.<br/><br/>Casting wise, Nick Stahl turns in a good performance as John Conner and is quite likable in the role. Of course nothing can hide the fact that re-casting a pivotal character causes some pretty major disconnect, and I think had Edward Furlong reprised his role it would have made for a better viewing experience. This is in no way a slight on Stahl's performance, but continuity and familiarity is important when doing a series.<br/><br/>Claire Danes is fine, but suffers from nothing to do with her acting skill. Kate Brewster just isn't that much of a character to play, but she does well with what she has and what little time she had to prepare.<br/><br/>All this goodness however doesn't take away from the fact that Terminator 3 is really just a copy of it's predecessor. The story follows pretty much an identical plot, and the retreading of key scenes from T2 but done with 'humour' really does sour the experience.<br/><br/>However, the biggest flaw surely must be that the film takes the philosophy, effort and loss of the first two films and renders them completely pointless. Everything James Cameron tried to say has been taken back and replaced with a ""Sorry, the first two films were wrong, this is how it is!""<br/><br/>The best part of the film is when Skynet becomes self-aware and we are treated to early versions of Terminators and H-K's. However, this is over far too quickly, and you are left with a severe feeling of being had by lazy writers and greedy studios. The ""Rise of the Machines"" part does happen, but it's a case of blink and you'll miss it.<br/><br/>I don't blame Johnathan Mostow though. This film has studio interference written all over it, and they were obviously pulling the strings. However, if you were a relatively unknown director and someone offered you the chance to get paid a shitload of money to direct a Terminator film you wouldn't turn it down, no matter what these idiot fanboys claim they would do for the purity of the series.<br/><br/>A few years ago I would have said this was the worst of the Terminator films, but with the release of the by-the-numbers Genisys I think T3 is a well made and entertaining, but ultimately flawed and predictable entry into the franchise.<br/><br/>I always end up watching T3 it when I go on a Terminator binge and it's fine for killing a couple of hours, but given the meddling of the story, the re-casting, and the general lack of originality, I just don't really count it as canon.<br/><br/>The James Cameron directed ""T2: Battle Across Time"" from 1996 is the closest thing you'll get to a proper sequel. Not only does it reunite the original T2 cast, but seeing the Terminator and John Connor go FORWARD in time to Terminate Skynet (essentially turning the idea of the first films on it's head) would have made a great film in it's own right."
"illbebackreviews","3","0","2","1 January 2013"," Terminator 3 is a cheap rip off from Terminator 2 and everything about this film is done far worse...Not a movie for fans of the first two like myself
","***NEW UPDATE***<br/><br/>The movie sucks. <br/><br/>******<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of 'Terminator' and 'Terminator 2' and for quite a while, I've been embarrassed to watch this 2003 sequel as I've heard such mixed reviews from critics and IMDb users alike. Now that I watched, I feel sorta impressed by it.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines focuses on a 20 year old John Connor who is once again under subject for termination along with his high school friend Kate. This time, an even more powerful T-X is sent back in time but like in T2, the Arnold Schwarzenegger T-101 model is back to save the boy but more importantly Kate.<br/><br/>I found the story line in this movie both good and frustrating. It had some interesting elements such as the whole Judgment Day is happening in a few hours thing but there were also some annoying parts such as the over use of ""Get out!"" and the ""I'll (she'll) be back"" <br/><br/>As T2 is my 2nd favorite film of all time, I found some annoying things about this film such as the T-101 going into the pub and asking for clothes. Seriously??? I was also frustrated by the T-101 shopping which just looked stupid and was a joke to our memorable character. <br/><br/>However, I thought the basic story line of protecting John and Kate and making sure that Skynet could be shut down just in time to prevent Judgment Day from really occurring was interesting and it was nice to see Dr. Silberman's little cameo in this movie. <br/><br/>As much as the story line fascinated me, the best thing about the film was surely Arnold Schwarzenegger returning as the T-101. No one else could ever pull this off like Arnie. I was also extremely annoyed by the T-X and I thought the director was just desperate to make someone more deadly than the T-1000 but just failed miserably. The acting in this film was pretty poor, in my opinion. The only one who did a brilliant job was Arnold Schwarzenegger so that can be passed off. However, that scene where the T-101 is packing weapons into the caravan just annoyed me as the director just wanted the conversation to really go when the T- 101 was walking back and forth. It made it really hard to focus on important elements of the story. <br/><br/>Since the John/T-101 relationship was magical in T2, I wanted Edward Furlong to reprise his role, 12 years later, as the older John but the whole concept of a different actor playing John made me not care about his friendship and his fatherly love for the T-101.<br/><br/>One other disappointment in the film for me was the fact that we never got to see any real machines wasting humans after the machines rose.<br/><br/>That being said, the movie is enjoyable but is sure to disappoint many."
"gbriles93","2","0","2","22 July 2012"," Are you kidding me?
","Seriously? They ruined what could've been an amazing film series. This, to me, is nothing but a rip off of T2, just different terminator. John Connor is just flat out pathetic in this movie. Both the acting and the action flat out sucked. It was seriously like watching Judgment Day again with a few changes. I also hated how they didn't explain Skynet spawning when the end of T2 changes the fate of the machines taking over. It's weird how Edward Furlong played a better Connor than this shi**y-ass actor did. All I can say is that Arnold's return as the T-101 is the only thing i enjoyed about this garbage. I was so disappointed."

","This movie was entertaining! But if you've ever seen T2 you'll notice numerous instances where the director tried to steal from Cameron and failed.<br/><br/>The only reason Arnold agreed to semi-star in this film is because he got a gigantic paycheck. I know he is a billionaire, but he still likes to make money. If he had any integrity as a 'real' actor he would have turned this role down. But we all know he's not a 'real' actor.<br/><br/>The girl terminator they sent back in time could have been better cast by most people on the street, as her only real dramatic skills involve tilting her head in every other scene.<br/><br/>Good movie if you aren't looking for a good movie."

","The only good thing about T3 is when you think of oneliners you get for those Arnie soundboards.

A lack of suspense.<br/><br/>The dialogues are not written with passion. A lack of feeling.<br/><br/>John Connor has been made a wuss and is miscast even then.<br/><br/>The T800 is not really protecting John nor Kathleen in this one. The bullets are flying left and right while he just drives the van. They're just driving into freaking Mexico. They have no plan.<br/><br/>The TX - the new Terminator villain is not explained at all. What is she? What are her special powers? How exactly is she more advanced than T1000? She jumpstarts a car with her fingernail - what is that? She can produce any weapon but how? This whole concept is really lacking imagination. The TX visual display screen is really lacking imagination. Kristina Loken is quite attractive but she is not scary in any way.<br/><br/>Claire Danes is the best part of this movie. Her character makes ridiculous choices but thats because of the bad screenplay. She plays good.<br/><br/>Kathleen Brewster's father is really miscast.<br/><br/>Some of the action scenes were quite enjoyable. The jokes are cheap and recycled from previous Terminator movies.<br/><br/>The camera angles are wrong, T800 is not shown strong. Editing is wrong. (A lot of boring dialogue could have been left out.) The scenes are too clean. (Where is all that dark and gritty future?) The car chase was pretty cool. The CGI snake is fake. The music has no bass and low frequencies. The movie feels dated already. Stan Winston has done a good job with the endoskeletons but the camera is not capturing it. Too much stuff is copied from T2: Judgement Day. <br/><br/>This whole thing reads like some kid's school paper to me..."
"deftone00000","3","0","3","7 January 2012"," A sad money making effort
","The third film in the franchise would be quickly forgettable if not for it's ability to depress and disappoint fans of the originals. <br/><br/>What feels like more of a spoof than a genuine addition to the previous films is full of genuinely unfunny ""jokes"", huge plot holes, and unimaginative scenes shamelessly recycled from James Cameron's previous work. Somehow the Director manages all of this while at the same time avoiding any thought provocation and emotional content, something viewers tend to overlook in the previous films, even despite the dark subject matter of impending nuclear holocaust, inevitable unchangeable fate (which in itself contradicts the message well delivered in the second film of free will and writing one's own future), soulless killing machines hell-bent on murdering individuals, etc. Indeed despite all these gripping themes (hijacked from the previous films and not the directors own work), the director only manages to present to us an uninspired ret-con of the story presented. <br/><br/>Where before we are told the terminator cannot learn in order to limit his free will, the terminator in this film shows clear signs of learning and imagined ""wit"" as he spouts one liners in a way unfitting of a killing machine. I don't see this as actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who clearly does his best to play his quintessential role in the face of terrible direction. This new terminator is presented as something to be laughed at in funny situations, as in the scene where he takes his clothes from the male stripper, and is somehow stripped of all that made him menacing even as the hero of the second film. <br/><br/>The female villain of this film was full of emotion, sexiness, and wit, which only serves to discredit her as a terminator. She clearly enjoys killing, and her only defining feature is turning her arm into an assortment of guns, one trick to an otherwise unimaginative pony. <br/><br/>John Connor neither resembles nor acts like he did in the previous film, and comes across as a loser. Despite this, he does somehow manage to expertly activate a particle collider in one bodged scene. His new romantic interest is of so little importance or character I won't waste your time writing about her.<br/><br/>All in all, Terminator fans should probably avoid this disappointing film."

","Before I go apesh.t on this film... I just need to know... Why? Who allowed this movie to be filmed? Was anybody serious about this film? Whose idea was this? Of course, no point in asking questions... here are the answers. This film is very, very bad. Johnathan Mostow needs to go work someplace else, like in circus as a clown. If he wants to be funny, give him a chance to be a stand up comedian, not to ruin a good film with this sequel. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) was one of the best movies and best SF movies ever made if you ask me... and if you are planing a sequel... give it something worthy, not this crap! The entire film also borrows from the previous film. That's mental!<br/><br/>Arnold was good. In his Terminator element, it wasn't any of his fault! The Terminator (Arnie) here looks funny, his character was used for a entertaining purposes! In the first one, he was a dark cyborg with a mission to kill, in the second he was a protector... but here he was a laugh stock! That is a damn sacrilege! The writers and director decided to make one big campy parody of the entire film and title character. The same goes with other characters. Nick Sthal was solid as John Connor, slowly on a way to become a great military leader. But, writers ruined his character too. Claire Danes is a good actress, but here, she messed herself up. Her character was funny, from a veterinarian to warrior women over night doesn't seem right to me! Kristana Loken. OK I admit that we needed a woman Terminator, why not? But, her T-X character was too much, an endoskeleton that has a liquid metal? That's too much, an anti-terminator terminator! Gimme a break! And, of course Earl Boen makes a cameo as Dr. Silverman, also, alas... as a laughing stock. The only thing good here were special effects, the special effects were even better than anything else here. Money down the drain... don't watch it..."
"hall895","5","0","2","23 August 2011"," Most pointless sequel ever?
","They just couldn't leave well enough alone could they? Most everyone enjoyed the first two Terminator films. And most everyone was probably satisfied with the way the story wrapped up at the end of T2. The Terminator story had been told. It was over. But Hollywood can never resist an easy money-grab so after 12 years of allowing the franchise to rest in peace we got T3. And the movie inevitably made obscene amounts of money so the accountants were happy. The fans? Not so happy. If you liked the first two movies the joke's on you. Not only is T3 a rather lousy movie but it also makes the first two movies, the ones people actually liked, completely irrelevant. All that stuff about stopping the machines, changing the future, determining your own fate? Forget all that. The future is inevitable. What's going to happen is going to happen. So none of this really matters. If that's the case why am I watching these movies in the first place? <br/><br/>James Cameron had the good sense to stay away from this turkey. Linda Hamilton too. If only Arnold Schwarzenegger had resisted the lure of a giant paycheck we could have been spared the absurdity that is this movie. But alas Arnold went for the cash, Terminator legacy be damned. So we got this pointless, unnecessary, quite terrible sequel which cheapens the whole Terminator saga. Another Terminator gets sent back in time, John Connor starts running for his life, Arnold shows up to protect him and a bunch of things get blown up. The end. Story? What story? Who can be bothered with trifling things like a story when we can just blow out the budget on an interminable crane chase? The evil Terminator this time comes in the form of Kristanna Loken, a hot blond chick. This is likely in the hopes that the sight of a hot blond chick will distract teenage fanboys from the fact that the movie stinks. With Hamilton missing we need a new damsel in distress so we get a woefully out of her element Claire Danes. An action movie star she is most certainly not. John Connor is this time played by Nick Stahl, probably an improvement over T2's Edward Furlong. So at least there's one thing about this movie better than the last one. Not nearly enough to make up for the multitude of things which are much, much worse. Like Arnold's Terminator for example who just bounces from one pathetic attempt at an ""Hasta la vista, baby"" style catchphrase to another. I think somewhere along the way somebody got confused and thought they were writing a comedy. A comedic Terminator, yes that's what the world wants. Have these people no sense at all? Did Arnold not read this script and realize he was destroying the memory of his most iconic character? Or did he realize it and just not care as long as the studio's check cleared? The film's final insult comes with the ending which is no ending at all. The filmmakers have no resolution to their story, just a setup for another movie to come. So they rendered the story of the first two films meaningless and couldn't even bother to have any story of their own. Gee, thanks. So glad I paid money to watch this utterly pointless movie. The future is inevitable and that future apparently includes lousy Terminator movies."

","I know I'm not the first to do this, but i feel it's necessary to mention T2. I recently watched it, and I can tell you now that this movie is unwanted. The ending to T2 (I won't tell you what it is) is one of the most satisfying movie endings I have ever seen, and is up there with films like Saving Private Ryan and the Star Wars saga. This film takes the main idea from the first two (the 'changing the future' theme) and simply throws it out of the window. When this came out we were like: ""Hang on? Rise of the machines? But it ended in the last one!"" And so begins one of the many problems with this movie.<br/><br/>1) James Cameron. I see why he avoided this; they basically got his work and flushed it down the loo; claiming their's was better.<br/><br/>2) Arnie. He was brilliant in T1, perfect in T2 (his smile at the minigun still goes down as pure genius in my eyes) but he has simply run out of steam. He was old, human and dull in T3.<br/><br/>3) It wasn't a Terminator movie. Sure, it has Terminator in the title, but so does Terminator Salvation, and that's about as far from a Terminator film as you can get (while still using the same setting). I actually didn't mind TS, because it didn't pretend to be a Terminator film. This, however, did, and failed. I mean, it's a 12! <br/><br/>4) The characters. I didn't feel connected with any of them. Sorry to bring it up again, but in T2 Sarah and John Connor were brilliant, with Sarah's slow realisation about the machines and her transformation into someone less crazy and John's childishness showing through his hard outer shell were brilliantly portrayed, both with acting and writing. In this though, both were lacking in style and substance, and I found myself actually getting annoyed with John.<br/><br/>5) A female Terminator. Don't mean to be sexist, but come on! <br/><br/>Watching this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I am disappointed with the people behind this film for messing with such cinematic brilliance created by the first two. However, some action scenes pretty well directed, and the humour was quite funny in some places, but not T2 funny, like ""He'll live"". It was an uncool funny. for those reasons, it just wasn't very good.<br/><br/>5/10"

So I will keep it short.<br/><br/>Not a bad movie. The action scenes are well worthy of a Terminator franchise. The main problem I have with this film is mostly the character of ""John Connor"". Maybe it was the writers or maybe just the actor who was wrongly casted. I don't know.<br/><br/>In the first film they start with this mystical image of the one man responsible for the survival of the human race ""John Connor"" In the second film we have a smart, witty and somehow strong representation of the kid who will become the leader of the resistance against the machine.<br/><br/>However; in this film we have a sissy, insecure, scary cat with an amazing lack of confidence dude by the name of ""John Connor"". The portrayal of the character was pathetic. Are you telling that this joke of a man will be the saviour of the human race. Sad.<br/><br/>Then the other problem I have with this movies is that stupid scene was the one where Arnold gets reprogrammed by the T-X. John Connor asks the T-800 not to kill him and the Terminator obeys. Reese said in part 1 It can't be bargained with"" and now John did just that. Sad.

"oneguyrambling","6","0","2","8 June 2011"," The non-Arnie scenes are a total drag. Good thing he's in quite a few.
","Is it a fluke that Arnie appeared in arguably half a dozen of the best action flicks in a decade? Was Arnie simply handed all the best roles? Was he given a free ride? Was he unbelievably lucky? Or is he actually a credible leading man and commanding screen presence? <br/><br/>I think the answer for me came when I watched T3 last week. About half way through I realised what a dud movie this was in almost every sans-Arnie scene. His Terminator arrives maybe a third of the way in, and as a one guy audience the only thing that allows you to remain involved is knowing he's coming, when he departs proceedings it's 100% dullsville from there.<br/><br/>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br/><br/>Like many inferior sequels the film opens with a brief narration that serves as a recap for any action fan living under a rock for 20 years – in the future robots send back a cyborg assassin to kill a boy / young man named John Connor destined to become the fearless leader of humankind hellbent on fighting the robot occupation repeatedly.<br/><br/>The first time the cyborg was Arnie. The second time it was a slick liquid metal cyborg and the obsolete Arnie was reprogrammed to defend Connor. This time Arnie is once again the protector and the assassin is once again liquid metal, but this time the assassin is a hot chick – and she has wayyyy more toys and tricks than previous Terminators.<br/><br/>The rest is a carbon copy of T2 really, only 10 years on. Nick Stahl as John Connor is serviceable but he either did the steely-determined thing very well or he simply lacks personality, his future love interest Kathryn is played by the huge-eyed Claire Danes, the psychiatrist is back once again to continue his running joke – but aside from all that it is Arnie standing in front of a relentless killing machine for 2 hours.<br/><br/>That isn't to say that the film is without merit, it tackles the responsibility of copying a classic very seriously, but when you are taking on one of the best 4 or 5 films in history that's a pretty tall order.<br/><br/>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So after Kristina Lokken appears – naked – as the female Terminator (needless to say if she remained naked they would have sold millions more DVDs, she is a well built cyborg) she instantly sets about killing off various members of the resistance, who are all in their teens or early 20s at this stage. Lokken's Terminator is again liquid metal but this time can produce a veritable handyman's arsenal of tools and weapons, including a big f-you cannon from her arm.<br/><br/>Arnold arrives in the desert a short while later, and the two set about punching and shooting at each other all over the very state that Arnold would eventually lead.<br/><br/>I must admit that the first big chase is worthy of direct comparison with almost anything from T2, there are remote controlled cop cars, ambulances, a big mobile crane – which Arnold spends a great deal of time hanging off – and even a fire engine. It is a three year old boy's toyset on the bigscreen (my 3 year old actually does plays with all those things). The scene itself runs for maybe 10 minutes, it has the requisite ""big"" explosions and collisions, showcases the new lady-Terminator's abilities and Arnie's dogged determination, and best of all it all seems quite dangerous. Too often now chase scenes are just the lazy action-filler in films, there is little in the way of adrenaline or the perception of peril, the fact that this scene was so outstanding perhaps makes the rest of the film look a little shabbier by comparison.<br/><br/>After a couple more not quite so good chases and a shootout in a cemetery (which fell a little flat), John and Kathryn are told that Arnie must protect them so that they and their children will fight the machines later on. Seeing as how they only met each other a few hours previous, and that Kathryn up until that morning had a fiancé you could safely call that an icebreaker. Talk about arranged marriage; this is arranged kids! With Judgment Day inevitable and looming large it was a little disappointing to find the finale a little underwhelming, perhaps too clinical and formulaic, which seems obvious given I have already pointed this out as a replica of T2.<br/><br/>Arnold and Lady-T go roboto-a-roboto and cause millions of dollars in property damage, and all the while John Connor and Kathryn seem to stay just far enough and just close enough to danger.<br/><br/>The lady-Terminator seemed deadly but a little dumb, many times she had a target in her vice like grip and instead of squeezing them to death, snapping their bones like crackers or just pummeling them into oblivion she repeatedly threw them away.<br/><br/>I guess even robots should learn not to send a woman to do a man's job.<br/><br/>I firmly believe that there is another ""Great"" Terminator film to be made – last year's effort was OK but hardly a classic. More than anything this frankly mediocre effort showed just how much the franchise relied on Arnie to flourish, when a 60 year old man playing a giant killer robot is far and away the best thing going for your film it highlights how pivotal Arnie really is, finding his effective replacement might be near impossible, but it doesn't mean they shouldn't try.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6 / 10. The non-Arnie scenes are a total drag, but that one mega-chase elevates this up a notch. The film might not be required viewing, but that scene sure is."

It might have been better if James Cameron directed this one as well, but it's still a passable movie in the franchise. The plot of this movie is basically about how John Connor starts to become the leader the previous movies talked while building a relation with a girl, although the alteration doesn't really get completed. Even if this isn't a groundbreaking movie like the 2nd movie in the franchise and is a bit shorter, it doesn't try to be something it's not. The pacing is pretty fast and the action sequences are entertaining to watch. The movie however lack the gritty and suspenseful aspects from the previous movies and comes off a bit too silly at times. The connection between the two previous movies is done pretty well and is far from being a bad movie. It just isn't as great or good as the previous 2 movies in the franchise. Just don't expect too much after watching T2 or you might be disappointed. However the main negative aspect is how this movie doesn't seem all that legit and looked a bit cheap despite the big budget that went into this.

"AlexTheRamL","3","0","2","29 January 2011"," Just a big disappointment
","I'm going to admit director Jonathan Mostow had some balls to make this, your making another entry in the Terminator series, two of the greatest films of all time! Many people call this an astonishing summer action flick, but to me a hardcore Terminator fan this is just a big middle finger insult. The plot is it's 20 years later John Connor is moving across the world so that no more Terminators an find him. BUT! They do find him the T-800 (Schwarzenegger of course) and The T-X then it's basically the same plot as Judgment Day. James Cameron tied a knot so hard at the ending of Terminator 2 that they had to cheat the source material in this one Judgment day is not preventable and so the T-800 has to get them to a safe zone. You know for the T-X to be the newest unit it's really no where as advance as the T-1000 in the second one. The T-X might be more flexible and can still morph into people but the T-1000 can do that also he can form knives and stabbing objects to which to me is pretty badass. Nick Stahl is the new John Connor. I don't like him as John Connor at all. For one thing I thought John Connor would be this complete bad ass of a kid when he gets older, but he just seems like some wimp, plus his foul mouth language is gone, his advice to The T-800 well I don't remember him giving anything remember able to him. I mean Edward Furlong created the personality for John Connor and there was deep character development, for me Nick Stahl didn't really give me any personality for the older John Connor, I didn't feel like I knew John Connor at all, unless John was just suppose to grow up awkwardly, sure he seems less annoying then Edward Furlong but he just doesn't fit as the older John Connor, though I will admit I thought he was better than Christen Bale is Salvation. I'm glad Schwarzenegger did The T-800 again; if he did not choose to do it again then I would have never wanted to be made. He still doing what he does best, playing a badass machine, but his character kind of takes a step down because there is no character change. In the second one he went from a machine doing his mission into a father like figure for John. In this one he's just doing the mission. But he is still humorous and still fun to watch which is still good for me, but I was disappointed he didn't say ""I'll be back"", but with out a doubt he is the best part of the movie. There is also a new character; Claire Danes plays Kate Brewster essentially going to be John's husband in the future. Honestly I just thought she was awful. The T-X killed her husband and morphed into him. When they find each other the T-X morph back into itself, the expression on her face isn't what I expected, it looks like she saw a ghost, plus I thought she was just super annoying and I never felt she was actually scared plus she never really created a personality and the one thing she a John had in common is that they went to the same high school together and the more they spent time together I never felt they could ever get along with each other. I never saw a relationship for them. When I first rated this I gave it a 0% but I felt like I was being too harsh. To me the biggest flaw was the acting. The Claire didn't give her character a personality and Nick did awful as John Connor. In the first one everyone had a personality even Miles did and it made the movie incredibly suspenseful, you want them to stop Judgment day. In here there was no suspense and I honestly didn't care if the made it or not. Also I didn't like how it's basically the same plot as Terminator 2. They made me think that they didn't care about anything except the action in this. Now The Terminator is known to have great and I mean great action sequences make that many great action sequences. In this one for me the very best action sequence is the one where the terminator is hanging from the crane, I thought that was completely bad ass, also the part where the Terminator is carrying John in the coffin I thought that was pretty original. The other action sequences to me were just boring and didn't live up to the hype that I expected. Back then I had a lot of complaints about the action but today I just realize it was just nick-picking (if I said that right). Director Ang Lee was actually offered to direct this but he turned it down to direct the Hulk film, I'm not sure how it would've turned out if he directed this, he probably would have done a better job with the action sequences, well considering what he did to The Hulk maybe, but he is still a better director than Jonathan Mostow. Besides from Schwarzenegger still being a delight to watch and a few memorable action scenes Terminator 3 disappointed me with a lazy script, bad acting, many bland action scenes and awful character development. With being a hardcore Terminator fan if they called this anything else but Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines, I might have liked it more, otherwise I think the world would have been better without this."

","There are problems which plague any sequel in a franchise. Primarily keeping the tension by increasing the apparent level of danger the characters are in, usually this will involve a new enemy or more enemies.<br/><br/>Terminator 3 attempts to do this by introducing us to the TX. Whether it is the new director or the actress herself the TX somehow doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>And not feeling right is the real problem with T3. The original terminators had something terrifying about them, something dangerous but none of this is present in T3.<br/><br/>It is a decent action film that doesn't let you down if you separate it from the other films in its franchise.<br/><br/>There is one note to add. The ending is magnificent, beautiful and brave. In my opinion no other pop corn fair that i can think of has ended in such an excellent, thought provoking and visually stark manner.

","A TX (Loken) machine from the future is sent back in time to assassinate John Connor (Stahl) in a bid to wipe out human kind's chance of survival.<br/><br/>12 years had passed between the crowd pleasing sequel Judgement Day and the release of this 3rd part and at a time of technical revolution, that prevailed over story in this disappointing if still watchable sequel.<br/><br/>The Matrix had broken minds, Lord of the Rings was epic swiping Oscars for all departments and such, the science fiction genre itself was a stepping stone tester for digital effects which this film justifies right from the off.<br/><br/>As the previous films started with two naked men appearing in an electrical storm this film uses the same effect with a stunningly blank Kristanna Loken and the usual coolness of Arnie. Before this there is a reasonable opening as Nick Stahl's John Connor, a depiction of insecurity and hurried decisions, sets the game straight for us that had forgotten. The Terminator had tried to kill Sarah Connor in 1984 before remerging years later to terminate John Connor himself. Arnie, again the good robot, is programmed to protect John Connor and new character and significant protagonist of the future Kate Brewster (a fairly composed character from Claire Danes) The story moves along with its futuristic ethics and mythology that were used in the previous two films, though without the conviction and importance Cameron laid down so easily, and his presence, and lack of it, is certainly profound here.<br/><br/>Every term spoken by the T101 feels action orientated with a heavy weight. He burdens everything with a macho ideology whilst the camera shoots him in a hero motive. There isn't a free flowing spontaneity about the terminator, which is a dreadful shame.<br/><br/>The opening stages of Connor laying the current situation down are good, giving the film a dramatic implication as he reveals his loneliness and depression over the lack of happenings since the postponement of judgement day. The scene on the bike with the animal in the road was well shot, very simple and capturing the feeling of bad luck perfectly.<br/><br/>But after that director Jonathan Mostow simply over indulges the film with a hyperbole of action sequences that would never ever happen in their presentation of realism. The big truck (trying to capitalise on good technique from previous films) sequence is so over blown and unnecessary whilst the final sequences and scenes in Skynet are all perfect timing and minimal chances have an alternative action orientated drivel.<br/><br/>As Terminator Salvation showed as well the science fiction genre has become fixated with special effects rather than using the plot to the advantage of the story, which this justifies. Whilst the essence of the terminator origins sees this one through there is little salvation in that this is not a match for the previous two releases."

","When I first saw this movie. I knew that James Cameron didn't direct this. Why?, you may ask. James Cameron makes GOOD movies. I was expecting this movie to be awesome, and since it was a Terminator movie, it had a lot of potential. I'm not really surprised, though. 3rd movies are always the worst. For example, Godfather 3, Poltergiest 3, Alien 3, Back to the Future 3, and Karate Kid 3. The only good 3rd sequels I can think of are Goldfinger and Return of the Jedi. I was expecting an action movie with a good plot line and character development and good acting. The robotic Terminators in the first 2 movies also were kinda realistic because terminators are cyborgs. But here's how this one was. There was no good acting, there was only running and screaming, Arnold wasn't as awesome as he was in the first 2 films, and they replaced all the special effects from the first movies that are realistic because of terminators being cyborgs with CGI. I mean, why not replace robotic looking robots with computer animation? To make it look better?! CGI looks awful. I'm real mad at James Cameron for not directing this movie. Maybe then it would be decent. However, the first two movies are so good that I almost forgive James Cameron for not directing the latest ones. James Cameron, I forgive you because you've made too many good movies to slander your reputation."

","To shoot a film down with one star from a possible 10 probably seems a little harsh, how ever i assure it is completely justified. For one, this movie is a sequel which is not coherent with either the narrative, spirit or story of the first two installments of the franchise. Poorly cast, Stahl and Daines (who are respectfully quite talented) fail to bring a sense of urgency when required, at times the dialogue is stilted and even the characters seem bored. Only one line devices have carried over from the previous installments, all of which feel tacky, like biting into yesterdays bread. i would mention that the work of Stan Winston in this film is excellent, and the only saving grace. This film offers nothing new, breaks no new ground and requires you strangle your disbelief rather than suspending it. A cash cow indeed."

But the brazen approach that Mostow and the producers have chosen, to rehash all and change squat, to deliberately aim for the lowest possible denominator, this is the epitome of the most abhorrent and depressing attitudes in mainstream film-making. Of course, these smug a-holes can get away with it because they know there's a ready market for car chases & special effects that don't alter from one film to the next. There's a ready crowd of idle, passive, self-professed ""fans"" who can be whipped into a viewing frenzy by means of bombastic advertising, plus industry-endorsed film pundits who only care about their paychecks, and nobody will be the wiser. The loser at the end of day is the average movie-goer who has no idea he has been film-flammed by marketing.<br/><br/>T3 takes place entirely in movieland, where nothing is real or plausible or of any consequence. Its the passive film-viewer's most delirious fantasy come alive. It has ""cash-in"" plastered all over it. The thing couldn't possibly get worse, till you notice that this film scores 6.7/10 at IMDb and 70% at RT. The ""tongue-in-cheek"" humor that everyone was clamoring about is revolting.

","Well, so much for ""No fate but what we make."" 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' proved that we're not up to our own destiny as 'T2' proved otherwise. Be prepared for all the events in the previous installment to be thrown out the window in 'T3.' The perfect comparison is the transition from 'Aliens' to 'Alien 3.' (By the way, I don't think there's much of a coincidence that both 'T3' and 'Alien 3' are bad movies that followed part 2's directed by James Cameron; apparently no one knows how to follow him up, or even if they should.) (Spoiler following) In 'Aliens' Ripley spends the entire movie protecting Newt, Hicks and Bishop and stopping once and for all the alien race only to have 'Alien 3' open with Newt & Hicks dead, Bishop to die later and the aliens breeding again like nothing happened. 'T2' taught us, we are in charge of our future, and 'T3' says, ""nope, the set future is 'inevitable.'"" And I haven't gotten to the worst aspect (even worse than the dialogue, 'Talk to the hand!'): this is one of the most pointless sequels of all time. It's almost a line-by-line, shot-by-shot remake of 'T2.' Schwarzenegger is a good T-101 sent back to protect Connor, and a liquid metal Terminator sent back to kill him. There's the daylight street chase. There's the gun round-up. The one-liners (only, in 'T3' they were extremely painful to listen to.) Etc, etc. I give it an extra ½ star for the special effects. Unfortunately everything else – the acting, dialogue, originality, inconsistencies, plot holes, laughable characters (that were supposed to be taken seriously), was so far under par, it was unbelievable Cameron even let this get green-lit. And trust me: you'll feel every bit of Hamilton's absence."

","Firstly I'd like to say I'm a huge fan of Terminator and T2, unfortunately T3 is worlds away from the quality of them. It's not an easy task to live up to two of the best sci-fi films ever. However, that doesn't mean it isn't worth a look because there is a lot to like.<br/><br/>Jonathan Mostow takes over from James Cameron in this installment and deserves big credit for carrying on the Terminator journey well and creating exiting action along the way. Some of the set pieces are breathtaking, including a brilliant fight that involves a crane and the graveyard scene is very good as well. In the action stakes, not much more could have been asked for is probably the films best strength.<br/><br/>As for the casting, I'm sorry to say that its mostly bad news. Arnie seems too old and didn't have the same impact on me as he did in the previous films. He looks a little bit out of place in some of the action scenes as well. The T-X, played by Kristanna Loken is OK but by the far the weakest villain of the trilogy. Loken is not bad in the role but the character could have been much better. Claire Danes as Kate Brewster seems out of place and is definitely miscast. But there is Salvation (ha!), Nick Stahl is excellent as John Connor and carries on from Edward Furlong easily. I was disappointed not to see Furlong back as he was brilliant in T2 but Stahl is good and was unlucky not to be offered to reprise his role for Terminator Salvation (you can hardly argue with Christian Bale though).<br/><br/>Overall, Terminator 3 is an above average action film and packs some great action into the running time and has an interesting plot with a few surprises I didn't see coming. Another high point is the excellent, downbeat ending that leaves you wanting more. Don't expect another film as good as Terminator or T2 because you will be disappointed, just enjoy the thrills, the story and the excellent action."

"lagriff05","7","0","1","27 June 2009"," Solid, if very unnecessary.
","This Terminator movie continues in the line of classics by starting off very similar to how the first two did - opening with our main characters, and then introducing a Terminator, appearing in the nude and obtaining clothing and a vehicle quickly. This whole film can kind of be likened to a past-his-prime wrestler trying to overcompensate for his age, as it does kind of seem to be riding on the trends set by the first two...but hey, it's the goddamn Terminator, and this movie is entertaining as hell.<br/><br/>Okay, okay, this movie is very unnecessary and goes against every moral the original two Terminator movies stood on. It takes a 180 from the moral of the last two, which was that you can choose your own destiny, and now apparently says that you CANNOT do that. I guess nine years off changes a film's direction a bit.<br/><br/>I think another weird thing about this is that the Terminator series has always balanced humor with serious moments, but this movie is way darker than the others in thematic alone, with a more bleak outlook in general. The others were sort of hopeful in their darkness and chaos, with a light to guide our heroes out of it, and an overall triumphant feel, but this one is just dark and depressing. As such, the humor is a lot more vibrant and stupid this time around, clearly trying to lighten the mood of the overwrought plot.<br/><br/>But really, this is just all about the high-octane fist-pumping action scenes, which are maybe a little more dragged out, but they still draw the viewer in with skill and class, with the first half of the movie being unbelievably good at it. T3: Rise of the Machines is not a classic, but it is a very good movie that I don't think Terminator fans will want to miss."

","And with that quotation is a perfect example with everything that is wrong with Terminator 3 and how is doesn't keep in spirit with the James Cameron masterpieces.<br/><br/>Set in 2004, John Connor (Nick Stahl) is an out-the-grid drifter. Computer systems around America are starting to fail, and this is a puzzle to Air Force General Robert Brewster (David Andrews), the commander of the new Skynet system. In 2032, the machines had lost the war and sent an advance terminator, the TX (Kristanna Loken). Her mission is to kill John Connor's lieutenants, including Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), a vet and John's future wife. The resistance send a re-programmed Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect John and Kate from the TX and the impending doom of Judgement Day. The Terminator tells John and Kate that John and Sarah Connor never stopped Judgement Day, just delayed and that Judgement Day was just a day away. This sets the heroes into a race against time to stop the event.<br/><br/>I bet James Cameron wished he used his alternative ending, it would have stopped any sequel being made. The whole point of the ending Terminator 2: Judgement Day was Judgement Day was stopped and that John and Sarah were free to live their lives. What's the point if they is no hope. James Cameron refused to do T3, saying T2 was the end of it. Linda Hamilton refused to do T3 because Cameron wasn't involved, and Schwarzenegger only did this film because he was paid $30 Million and 20% of the profits, I don't blame him really. It also helped his political ambitions.<br/><br/>The choice of director was Jonathan Mostow, a workman-like director who made the awful U-571. Also, the screenwriters were John Brancato and Michael Ferris, wrote Catwoman, that says it all.<br/><br/>T3 was basically made as a re-harsh and parody of T2. They is too much humour which wasn't needed at all. The whole point of the first two films was that they were played straight as possible. They are poor lines and no good one-liners (such as 'you are terminated!') compared in the first two films,. When the Terminator steals his clothes off a male-strippers, and eyes stealing them off a fat woman, or that the TX makes her breasts bigger to stop the cops these are all very bad signs. The action scenes were well done, but nothing surprise, nor especially memorable.<br/><br/>But the worst part of the film is the characterisation. John Connor goes from punk kid who had to battle the T-1000 to a scared young man who is really dumb, especially since he had to live through. Nick Stahl was a terrible choice to play John Connor. Arnold Schwarzenegger ends up over-acting and being overly emotional, which is surprising seeing he is an actor of limited talents. Claire Danes is a pretty good actress, but isn't served well in this film. Kristanna Loken lacked the menace of being a foe to the Terminator and the screenwriters were just pushing the extremes from large bloke (T1), to skinny man (T2), to skinny woman (T3).<br/><br/>The screenwriters attempt to hard to make twists in this film. The only things worth seeing are Earl Boen cameo as Dr. Peter Silberman and the ending. Any true Terminator fan should ignore this film and just focus on T1 and T2."

It's nearly the second one again, however with a lady cyborg this time. Which's cool and modern.

Originally the matter of the doomsday in 1999 as false happening is truly laughable, and such a disgrace to the first 2 movies. The climax wasn't up to what preceded it. The CGI was good, but for sure not a milestone like the sequel of 1992.

And I HATED the nudity; it's the way how Hollywood movies are sold since 1968, and I just HATE that!<br/><br/>I liked the way (Arnie)'s trade mark ""I'll Be Back"" had been handled without hackneying (""I'm back"", ""she'll be back"",.. smart!), still the Terminator's gags are the most enjoyable moments in here.<br/><br/>I recall well that at the time of its release, it was one of the most smuggled movies ever; managing to be a rented videotape, near my house, while it was in cinemas, or even before that! Also, its IMDb first rating was something like 9,8!! That what made me learn about the IMDb's ratings as not always the golden truth, hence nothing is as it seems. Btw, after 6 years, it's now 6,7..

Watch it and I hope you enjoy it, just don't go into it thinking or expecting what you saw and learned in T2."

","With this film i suspect they tried to redress the criticisms levelled at the T2 film. Leaving the pubescent behind the film concentrates instead on a twenty something John. His mother is dead and he is living 'off grid', working odd day construction, getting paid in cash and getting drunk. He drives recklessly at night on a bike, in short John Conner is in something of a rut. In to his world the film introduces a new Terminater or 'Terminatrix', dressed in a red leather outfit and tightly pinned back hair Kristianna Loken is the machine a teenage boy with a Sn'M fixation would have built. She severely scans her environment, killing her targets with a sadistic smile playing across her cold, model looks. As a machine she doesn't match up to the other two. Her technology seems neither as intimidatingly huge as Arnie or as strange or sinister than the T2. The special effects are OK ,but nothing unique and the action sequences seemed neither plausible or particularly spectacular. Claire Danes as Johns future wife irritates with her shrill whining, and has little chemistry with her two other leads. Nick Stahl is a talented actor and brings a introspective, confused element to the older john conner. Arnie worked hard to regain a younger mans physique, but there is no hiding his age. More ill advised 'Terminater humour' fell flat with me, and was a poor replacement for a darker tone considering the films theme of a nuclear Apocalypse. The films script has huge plot holes in it and inconsistencies which other reviewers have pointed out. Sadly T3 fell foul of the ringing cash machine behind the script and with a 18 certificate, more adult script it could have been so much better. Since it is inevitable that they will make a T4 i hope they at last make the film T2 and T3 should have been."

","We could almost unanimously agree that Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the best action movies ever made. Having established that, I understand that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had a high standard to live up to, so it should have been no surprise if it didn't quite reach the level of its predecessor. I've watched T3 twice now, which tells you that it's not entirely the disappointment that sequels often turn out to be. The action sequences definitely rival those of the other movies in the series, and in fact surpass those of many other action flicks, which is made possible by the fact that the characters in the high-speed chase with multiple crashes and explosions are not human and thus can survive any crash. Kristanna Loken is HOT as the Terminatrix. The movie dishes out the characteristic ironies of time travel and glimpses into the future, although none quite as powerful as the revelation in T2 that the Terminator crushed by Sarah Connor in Part 1 became the prototype for the machines that would eventually terrorize humans. It is interesting to see John Connor grown up, living with the paranoia that comes from his experience with the Terminator, and his feelings about his destiny as the leader of the human race. He is not quite the adult John that I pictured after seeing the trash-talking, street-savvy teenager in T2, but I can accept that people may change, especially after a traumatic experience of nearly being killed by a machine. The movie does not forget the more memorable moments of those which came before it, including a variation of ""Come with me if you want to live,"" and the recurring character of Dr. Silberman, although Arnie's delivery of ""I'm back"" makes me cringe and think that sticking with the good ol' ""I'll be back"" might have been less cheesy.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a good, though not great, movie as long as the viewer remembers that sequels rarely live up to the ones before it, and yet...this film leaves me with a disturbing, unsettling feeling that it should never have happened. It feels like an afterthought, which we all know it wasÂ–one last blockbuster in a fading acting career, one last attempt to make some money on the phenomenal franchise. More than that knowledge of Hollywood, however, I feel troubled as a fan of the first two movies and of Sarah Connor. While I understand that Sarah is only a fictional character, this movie seems an insult to her memory. The fact that the Terminators still exist, are still trying to kill her son and take over the world, makes Sarah seem that much more tragic. After watching her nightmares in T2 which portrayed nuclear explosions with horrifying realism, and cheering her on while she overcame the impossible, I cannot stomach the thought that the machines still come into existence and try to take over. It makes me glad that ""Sarah Connor"" did not live to see this film.<br/><br/>In summary...it's a decent movie and worth a couple viewings, but when you go back and watch T2 again, just pretend that T3 never happened."
"AsianMary88","6","0","1","13 January 2007"," The Terminator Trilogy is terminated
","The Terminator, which was released in 1984 was spectacular for its time. Although, some of the special effects may seem outdated today, it is still an outstanding movie. It told the story of Sarah Connor and how her son would one day be the leader of the world resistance against the machines that have taken over the world, the last chance for human survival. A Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back to 1984 to kill Connor before her son is born, but Kyle Reese (Michael Beihn) is also sent to protect her. It's a simple storyline, but it was still an effective movie. A sequel to this movie was inevitable, thus the spawn of Terminator 2: Judgment Day in 1991. The special effects were better and the story was expanded. This time around, the terminator once again played by Schwarzenegger, is the good guy to protect John Connor, now 13, and the T-1000 is sent to kill him. It was pretty much the same movie, but with bigger and better effects.<br/><br/>Even still, both of those movies, directed by James Cameron, are one of the best sci-fi action movies ever made. Jonathan Mostow, director of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, could learn a thing or two from him. The original storyline was massacred. The entire theory that ""The future is not set"" is ignored. It is paraphrased in the opening as ""the future is still not written"", but the writers forgot about it because from the plot twist at the end, the nuclear war is inevitable. There is no stopping it. So, then, that means that the future is set and there really is no use in trying to change it. ""Fate is what we make of it"" no longer applies. The writers should've researched the previous Terminator films before starting on the third.<br/><br/>What this movie lacks is James Cameron's direction. I give it a six out of ten stars only because of its action and the fact that the villain is now a hot and sexy female robot. I hear a fourth one is in the makings, and this is a mistake. Domestically, this film did not do well, so there is no hope for Terminator 4. I still like this movie because the action genre is my third favorite movie genre. I recommend this movie to any action movie lover, but not for Terminator fans."

All the elements of the winning formula are here - Mr. Gov'ner, Arnie; the bad Terminator, this time even a lady Terminatrix, T-X, and the cool plot. Oh, really? The film is unbearably boring and inevitably dull. There are two wooden facial expressions on Arnie and they are so predictable, that you can play the whole role instead of him. Kristanna Lokkn is a bad actress indeed. She doesn't even pretend to play, she just runs well, falls down well, looks in a blank stare well and then kills fast. See, anyone else can play this all. You didn't need to pay Arnie so much bucks for this trash! The very scene of the cars' chase is also very predictable and it is not even funny. The biggest problem of this sequel is a sheer absence of any humor and then totally bad play of those young actors who are John Connor and his future wife. You really miss Linda Hamilton and all her really deep work. Bad, bad film, indeed."

","Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the T-800, this time sent back to take on a far superior model that is programmed to destroy other terminators, however also the fact remains that destroying the data and chips merely postponed judgment day and John Connor (Nick Stahl who replaces Edward Furlong) tries to follow in his mother's footsteps in preventing the war but finds his attempts are futile. Also there is Claire Danes who is also targeted with Connor for termination and who will also grow up to be his wife. Terminator 3 can be seen as somewhat of a comeback for Arnold after witnessing what could possibly be the longest slump of an actor's career. After True Lies, Arnold made what has to be some of the lamest action flicks of his career (And that isn't even counting his embarrassing ventures into comedy and the Batman franchise) Terminator 3 can be seen as a comeback as it is superior to everything he's made since Terminator 2 but generally inferior to everything before. (Let alone the first two of the series) One peak at the title and one is somewhat shocked at the negative emotions regarding this film, a glance at IMDb's forum labels this to come up every now and then as Arnold's worst flick. (Let's not even get into the fact The Terminator and Commando fall behind Eraser and End Of Days in the best category (Shudder)) but this is not the case and Terminator 3 holds up fairly well in the story department which is handled very well. The action sequences are also exciting and Arnold is in good form. The main flaw is the new villain who just isn't as imposing as Robert Patrick or Arnold Schwarzenegger from the original. The novel touch here is that the machine is a female but clearly she doesn't do anything the T-1000 didn't do and even though Loken is adequate, it becomes obvious that she couldn't really hold her own against Arnold. Also the return of Earl Boen (The holdover from the first two movies) is wasted and is basically forgotten soon. Indeed the whole movie feels rushed and seems to indicate that the pace is quick because the director is on a deadline. Indeed usually you want movies to be shortened but for once I would have liked to see it longer so I could have found out more about some key moments which aren't developed due to the main plot. In other words Cameron could make a movie compact and complex. Jonathan Mostow can only make the movie compact and although Terminator 3 is worth watching for the genre fan, it goes without saying that it doesn't hold up when compared to the first two. Which is of course a given.<br/><br/>* *1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)"
"Chrivhec","6","0","1","29 July 2006"," A real shame it is.
","When I heard there was going to be a third installment of the Terminator movies, I had high hopes, because T1 and T2 were both absolutely great. My first thought when I heard the title 'Rise Of The Machines' was that the movie was going to be about the war against the machines, because that would have been entertaining, not thinking about the story then. But I was wrong. It's another movie about a Terminator that was sent back through time to kill John Connor. In T1 and T2, that story fits. In T3 it doesn't, and that's because of some major plot holes and disturbing story lines.<br/><br/>T3 is a good and descent action movie, but it just wasn't supposed to be. After seeing T2 it was clear that the war against the machines was prevented by the T-800 and John and Sarah Connor. But apparently it wasn't, and that's actually the biggest plot hole of all. In T2, when the Terminator and John Connor are driving to Byson in order to stop Sarah Connor from killing him, the Terminator says 'Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war'. In T3, John Connor says 'You shouldn't even exist. We took out Cyberdyne over ten years ago. We stopped Judgment Day', and the Terminator says: 'You only postponed it. Judgment Day is inevitable'... So in T3 he means that, whatever happens or whoever gets killed(including Byson in T2), Judgment Day is inevitable. That's the exact opposite thing that was claimed in T2. And actually, the fact that a T-X was sent back through time, isn't possible according to the story of the previous films. Because in the beginning of T2, Sarah Connor's voice says ""The computer which controlled the machines, Skynet, sent two Terminators back through time"". So there can't be a third terminator. I can imagine some people might think 'But maybe they didn't know that a third terminator was sent back?'. Yes, that is a possibility. But that wasn't the intention of the story. Otherwise Sarah would have said ""Skynet sent three terminators back through time"". It just doesn't make sense. I wish it did, because I like Arnold and I know Jonathan Mostow is a talented director. And that's why I think it's such a shame that this movie was directed by a very smart man, who blew his reputation by directing T3. Breakdown and U-571, two amazing movies full of suspense, both directed by Jonathan Mostow. I was very impressed by both, and from then on I knew Mostow has got what it takes to make good movies. With T3, he probably saw his big chance of becoming one of the most popular directors in this century, but I think making sure that T3 would be an amazing film was too hard for him. He thought he could, but I think he overestimated himself. James Cameron is a legend and has already made 2 of the best movies ever with T1 and T2. No one could have done a better job, including for the sequel. Damn it Mostow, you're such a talented director, I wish you said no to T3.<br/><br/>I can understand why Schwarzenegger agreed to play in this film. Actually he did a pretty good job. It's not his fault that his character 'had to be' different than in T2, he just did what they asked him to do. In T2, the T-800 said that he can learn things from humans. But what we saw in T3 was a bit exaggerating... First of all, the T-800 couldn't have known that the car keys were above his head. In T2 John showed the T-800 that some people hide their keys there, but nobody said this to the T-800 in T3, so he couldn't have known that. They didn't teach him a lot of human things like in T2, so the scene in which the T-800 couldn't kill John and chose to shut himself down, is actually pointless. <br/><br/>Conclusion: this movie shouldn't have been made. I just hope Jonathan Mostow realizes his mistake, and hopefully he'll get another chance to prove he really is a good director."

","The thing that struck me most about Terminator 3 was how liberally it borrows from T2. Once again, we're trying to stave off judgment day. Once again, a shape-shifting robot who is sent back in time to kill John Connor, and another Arnold is sent back in time to protect him. There's another vehicle scene, the initial confrontation between the terminators, etc. The problem is, the plot just isn't all that interesting because we've already seen it all done and done better in T2, with better actors too. It's too bad Edward Furlong was dropped from this project because I have a feeling it would have been much better with him onboard reprising his role as John Connor. Having Linda Hamilton and maybe even Robert Patrick would've been nice too. As it was, though, Claire Danes and Nick Stahl just didn't really cut it, in terms of likability or chemistry. Kristianna Loken was not a convincing villain as the T-X either. In a nutshell, I think T3 was a so-so rehash that attempted to one-up it's predecessor and fell flat.

Together with John Connor, it must stop the rise of the machines or all humanity will fall.<br/><br/>Like i've said in my past reviews, I never appreciated the concept of people going back in time to do all these things so this will happen in the future as much as other people did. However, the second movie decided to top it off. Nw the reason to watch this movie is to find out why is there still a Judgement Day and what happened to John Connor's mother.<br/><br/>Well, they decided to take the easy and risk-free way out of it, turning this into a big, fun, and loud action film. Well, it's worth it. Although it doesn't put the mind into the plot, it certainly is (ironically) a better movie than the first.<br/><br/>Now you guys might go crazy because I said this. I just like it a lot more than the first film, although not as good as the second. The action scenes are tons better than the first two films and the CGI really done well. The plot is still the same as ever and the dialog is campy and fun.<br/><br/>So the general word in this film is ""fun"". Don't take it too seriously. It has a lot of humor and equal drama. The action sequences are fantastic and has one of the best car chase sequences I've ever seen. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a bigger and better role in here and Kristanna Loken, playing the new Terminatrix, has a perfect performance. Her role on the Terminator is great! It's just that good! The other two (Nick Stahl and Claire Danes) were also good.<br/><br/>The score, although not the same as the first two, is good.

","I won't give T:3 a very high rating as a movie, but I will give it a high rating for entertainment, especially for action junkies. During the first half there is an inspired ""chase"" scene that is like nothing I have ever seen before, from its sheer audacity to the unabashed destruction in its wake. Arnold Schwarzenegger, now California Governor, seems to have been born to play the Terminator. However, although he looks much like the Terminators in the prior two installments, tells us that he is in fact a different edition.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl is the 20-something John Connor, object of the killing cyborgs of the two earlier editions. We remember that John Connor is supposed to be the savior of the world after the destruction by the machines, and once again future machines have sent one of their own to the present to exterminate him. (I don't know why they didn't send one back to a time when he was maybe 3 or 4, seems he would have been an easier target then!)<br/><br/>The exterminator this time takes the form of beautiful model turned actress, Kristanna Loken as T-X. (Reports are that she bulked up with muscle for this role, and she looks quite menacing, in a good way!) She is ruthless in her pursuit of her targets, but it seems she sometimes fails to take good opportunities to exterminate certain targets. But it is a movie, after all.<br/><br/>So, once again the movie is about the two terminators from the future, passionless, one programmed to kill John Connor, the other programmed to protect him. Which one do we think will succeed? Claire Danes also has a good role, as Kate Brewster, assistant veterinarian, who also has a father Robert Brewster, a military man, who has leadership of some future state of the art computer network system.<br/><br/>This movie is a broad comedy and the lead characters play it that way, especially Schwarzenegger and Loken, the cyborgs from the future. It is a dark comedy, to be sure, because there are a few people killed in cold blood. Not a great story, but an interesting one, and it has more action than one person needs in a 2-hour viewing.<br/><br/>Edit: April 2020, watching it again after all these years, it has pretty much the same impact on me.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. The machines have manufactured a sophisticated computer bug which systematically begins disabling all systems worldwide. No more communication with defense installations gets the Pentagon nervous and Robert Brewster is forced to put the prototype intelligent computer network in service, trusting it will find and defeat the bug. Instead, it becomes all part of the machines' plan, to launch an all-out war of destruction. John and Kate end up being directed to a safe shelter in the mountains, designed years earlier for the President, and they are destined to be the two to repopulate the world and continue the fight against the machines.

","The movie was amazing.<br/><br/>I'm not exactly sure how somebody can 'fool themselves' into liking a movie just by being a die hard fan, but that's not the case with me. I was a huge Ninja Turtles fan, but still think the third movie was horrible. As much as I liked the first two Back to the Future films, I believe that the third in the trilogy isn't good at all. Alien 3? Don't get me started.<br/><br/>The Terminator trilogy, on the other hand, happens to be the best in my opinion. Each movie in the series is by far excellent. The first one is great because of the intriguing storyline and dark feeling; the second being awesome because of the several scenes of hilarity and sweet special effects; the third belongs with the first two because of the mind-blowing action that slams you in your seat. The ongoing storyline that continues throughout all three movies is awesome.<br/><br/>The action scenes, I guess, are where I'll begin. The chase/fight scenes were absolutely remarkable. If anybody tells you that the effects looked cheesy, shoot them in the face if a gun is available; if not, bludgeon them with the nearest blunt object. The special effects were by far better than they were in T2, so every action scene that occurred (which was very often) was stupendous.<br/><br/>For true Terminator fans, consider T3 a treat for including several references to the past two movies. I'm a gigantic fan of the Terminator series so I was able to pick up on several small references, which was really cool. Some cameos from previous characters were nifty (including Dr. Silberman).<br/><br/>The storyline isn't really a rehash of the first two movies; it went on a different pretense. The TX's mission parameters weren't only to assassinate some of the Resistance leaders, but to also see to it that Judgement Day begins.<br/><br/>I don't understand many people's big gripe with the ending. I would discuss it, but I won't give out spoilers to people who haven't seen it yet. But I'll say that the ending was invariably appropriate, in my opinion. I guess you'll either like it or hate it. It's not that I feel it's a brilliant ending, but I do think that it was the best way to end this particular film.<br/><br/>If you really like the first Terminator movie, you'll most likely appreciate Terminator 3. If you didn't like the first one, then it's hard to say. Either way, expect to see some of the greatest action sequences you've ever seen."

","When I first heard they were making a third Terminator movie, I was expecting it to be absolutely horrible. Fortunately I was wrong, but T3 still isn't great. T1 impressed audiences with its dark and gritty style, and T2 awed people with its spectacular action scenes and special effects. T3 is merely a passable summer action flick with a recycled story. <br/><br/>Sarah Connor is dead and John Connor (Nick Stahl) is in his twenties. Judgment Day never happened, but John is paranoid, and is constantly looking over his shoulder. The film gets going when a new female Terminator called the T-X (Kristaana Loken) is sent back in time to kill Connor, his future lieutenants and his future wife Katherine Brewster (Claire Danes). Again, Arnold is sent back to protect them. Arnold explains to John that Judgment Day is inevitable, but John and Katherine can't accept that, so they attempt to stop Judgment Day once and for all. Again. And there you have the film's biggest weakness: Deja Vu. T3 brings nothing new to the table, except a daring ending.<br/><br/>T3 has the most lighthearted feel of all the Terminator films. The sentimentality from T2 has been replaced with jokes, most of which are misses in my opinion. The performances here are merely adequate. While the T-X is by far the most powerful of all the Terminators, Loken still doesn't exude the predator like quality Arnold and Robert Patrick had. I do like how the T-X beats up The Terminator from the start. The good guys feel outmatched, which Terminator 2 never quite achieved until the end. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are satisfactory in their roles, but I can't say I miss Edward Furlong. Arnold has more of a drill sergeant attitude here as opposed to the ""friendly"" Terminator in T2. His attitude here is much more believable IMO. He also deserves credit for getting back into perfect physical shape. <br/><br/>The action scenes are fun, but some are overblown to the point of absurdity. Stan Winston's makeup and robots are very impressive, and the endo-skeletons are scarier than ever. However, the film's greatest merit is its ending. (SPOILERS) Mostow took a big risk ending the movie with the start of the nuclear attacks. He could have gone the safe route and given the movie a happy ending. Now there is an opportunity to make a fourth Terminator movie that does not follow the same formula as T1; it can just be about the war against the machines. I just hope a studio will have the guts to make it without Arnold."

","Now this movie was alright. The action was good, the music had that terminator feel to it, and Arnold can still kick some ass. But the plot is starting to get old. Whiney John Connor is still complaining that his life sucks and that it is going to end with judgment day. Well duh!!! we figured that out in the last movie. Then there is the TX. My god, what a way to attract movie viewers. The director and writer must have been thinking ""this movie needs something raunchy, something hard core. Hey i know! BOOBIES. Even better, boobs in a hot tight leather jacket."" My friends came walking out of the theater saying the best part was when the bitches boobs expanded to a triple e cup. Plus the ending is sour.Everyoneknows judgment day is coming, why over dramatize it? Everyone knows that kate and john are going to win the war against the goddamn machines. This whole movie was a wasted opportunity. They should have gone with a whole new plot that involved something different than judgment day and a female terminator. So I am asking nicely directors and writers, if there ever is a T4, think about us, the fans, and how much we will despise you if you make another T3."

","The first Terminator had good special effects and a good plot. The second had really good effects and a decent plot. The third had great effects and a weak plot.<br/><br/>The explanation at the end is what really bugs me about this movie. They claim that they couldn't shut down the machine brain because it wasn't just in one place, but existed spread out in servers all across the country.<br/><br/>The thing is, that's stupid. If that were the case, then the artificial intelligence would have died shortly after it launched the nukes, because all those servers would have been destroyed. It would have been like taking a large knife, trying to remove your nose by jamming the blade straight into your skull. Sure, you'd get rid of the nose, but it wouldn't help your brain much.<br/><br/>Also, the idea that the Terminator had killed Conner in the future and was sent by his wife is flawed. Way back in the first film, we learn from Kyle that the human revolt against the machines had been successful, they had already won. Sending the Terminators back was a last-ditch effort to prevent that defeat. Therefore, there should have been no Terminator sent after John years after the machines were defeated.<br/><br/>Also, in the first movie Kyle says that the time displacement equipment was to be destroyed after he went thru. From T2, it's obvious that they sent the second one after he went. However, it's hardly likely that they would change their minds and not destroy the time machine after that; they already knew what a problem they were facing with just the two Terminators that had gone through already.<br/><br/>Also, if John's learning that he's going to get killed by a Terminator in the future (which he was told), then he should be able to avoid it.<br/><br/>Not to mention that a nuclear-safe bunker set up for VIPs wouldn't have obsolete computers, radios and other equipment; restocking and updating it would be a periodic activity.<br/><br/>There are so many basic plot flaws in this movie, the only value it has left is the special effects."

","OK well, there's not much i can say that hasn't already been posted. i'll not go into detail about all the obvious goofs and down right mistakes! i think everyone feels this film is a big let down in regards to the other films in the series, and i feel the same. i think it's how you feel no emotional connection to the characters, they're just there and gone. do big dramatic, emotional ending to the terminator, it just blows up and the film continues on. and another downfall, which i think was one of the biggest blunders of the film - the TX, an extremely advanced ""female"" terminator. first of all, a female terminator, nobody wants to see a female terminator being more advanced and stronger than arnie as the t-800. i mean, if this was all real life, i would say the T-1000 was a much deadlier enemy and could take down the TX (who seems rather stupid) no problem. but back to reality. i remember reading about this TX before the film was released and how it could reprogram other terminators and i was thinking, this is a great idea. but what became of it?- the TX reprogrammed the t-800 (which you didn't even see) and it came to get john with a very odd painful expression on its face, but ended up bashing that car to bits - WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT! i don't understand that bit, was it just trying to bash that car until his system was back to normal?? but i think the biggest mistake in this film (for me anyway) the part which when i saw it made some vomit actually come up into my throat was when in the convenience store he actually said - ""TALK TO THE HAND"" to the clerk. what the sh1t was that all about?! the terminator turns round and shoots the guy, thats whats meant to happen! or at least throws him or somethin! but i suppose that started when he was in the gay bar and he grabbed the guys hand and spoke to it. no bloody start to the film, like the other ones. sadly this is just a basic action film, with no depth. the only good part was the ending. i wont say stay away from it because I'm sure anyone who has seen the first two films will certainly have already seen this. so i'll end this by saying, this film only ralates to the other 2 films by name and by nothing else. i'm giving it 5/10. simply because for an action film it was alright.<br/><br/>p.s. does anyone think Paul Verhoeven would direct a good Terminator??"
"mlaprade","5","0","1","15 November 2005"," There is no future without ammo.
","I find a lot of the comments and flubs mere coincidence compared to the major accidents of intentional filmography and story telling. I have several major arguments with this film, as with many adventure films. How can so many rounds of ammo be fired by alleged professionals and no one gets hit? Why do they throw away expensive gun magazines and guns that run out of ammo, as if it's an old head of cabbage? And, most of all, where do these slim robots carry all the fuel to fly, and all the ammo to fire continuously for 30 seconds? There is never any sign of a fuel tank nor ballistic cache. Will Hollywood please employ an engineer to design these devices instead of an SFX jockey; or worse, a director. As an actor of 35 years, I can faithfully tell you that directors make actors do really stupid things we cannot control unless wealthy enough to have point options. Even Liam Neeson, one of the greatest actors of the 21st century, has a hard time battling directors. Those who get their way: Sharon Stone (on the outs), Julia Roberts (considered mostly bi-polar), Dustin Hoffman (with no debate, he commands), Jeff Goldblum (ad-libbing since inception and basically playing the same Dustin Hoffman/Robert Blake ""Let me try to throw the other actor in the scene off balance so that I look great"" garbage -- Will Smith beat him in ID4). I can't tell you how many times that kind of sufferage has been pulled on me by another actor/actress. Jeff Goldblume deserves a kick-in-the-crotch lifetime award. Dustin Hoffman deserves a one-man show award. Really. Any performance the man has ever done was a one-man show and he needs to stop harasing the entertainment industry with his single-minded self hero worship. I tell you...; Robert Downey Jr is better than every actor. Truthfully. Drunk, stoned on crack, and a week without sleep, he is better than them all. Why do you think he keeps getting stoned? No challenge."

","To give you a taste of how I feel about the latest addition to the Terminator franchise, let's have a look at the memorable lines that came out of them.<br/><br/>Terminator 1: I'll be back.<br/><br/>Terminator 2: Hasta la vista, Baby.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Talk to the hand.<br/><br/>There's one of your problems. The first two lines are cool, but the third one is not, just like the movie. It doesn't even come close to measuring up. (the fact that ""Talk to the hand"" conjures up images of Fran Drescher really doesn't help it either) This movie is a very lame descendant of the other two. Everything good about this movie has been done even better in the last two, with the exception of the new villain, who is hotter than a four alarm fire. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are okay. The problem here is Arnold. Whatever gift he had for playing this role is not here. Instead, he just looks and sounds ridiculous in this movie. Now, as far as the plot is concerned, what happened to the feeling of hope and the message of ""No fate but what we make for ourselves."" It is lost in this film, replaced with ""No matter what we do, we're gonna get screwed by Judgement Day, anyway."" Bottom line: This movie is not a worthy successor to the other two Terminator movies at all."
"raypdaley182","4","0","2","7 November 2005"," truly, truly dire.
","It gets a 4 for the special effects only! This film starts by making basic mistakes and then progresses to bigger and bigger howlers.<br/><br/>Let's see. Mistake number 1. The T-X. Right well X = 10. The last bad guy was a T1000. So she's a lower rated model than him then ? Any wonder when she materializes in the window of a clothes shop she ignores the abundance of clothes around her. Also it looks like she's in Rodeo Drive. And she still can't see clothes so she has to rob someone? And the person she robs just happens to be her exact size? Odds of that? Not really going to happen is it? Then the next mistake. She's looking for the lieutenants. So she accesses school records by phone (as these are supposed to be secure under the Data Protection Act it'd be unlikely their kept on a server that has dial-up access.)<br/><br/>Then to compound that mistake she manages to locate where they work from their High School records? Wouldn't it have been easier for them to have had her accessing the IRS or DMV records. DMV as they would have a more recent picture than their high school, then IRS as it'd show where their paying income tax.<br/><br/>She identifies Jose with a badge id and she scans his eye. Why? Like his High School records had retina information on them? No, I truly think not. Then she shoots him 4 times. The most advanced model can't kill with 1 shot from 5 feet? She must be an older model then.<br/><br/>Then Arnie can't decide which model his robot is. Is he a T101 or a T800? Make your mind up Arnold! Also why John avoids the deer, he's an idiot. Why hurt yourself, at that speed you would have barely wobbled when you hit the deer.<br/><br/>He seems to get a ride OK, but you'd think anyone giving him a ride would take him to a hospital. He could give a fake name and address, pay for his treatment in cash. He wouldn't appear on the grid by doing that. Another overlooked mistake.<br/><br/>So why does the logic driven T-X go to Kate's work address at 5am? Like she's going to be working at that time in the morning. Really logical, isn't it! And again when she kills the cat lady, she fires 5 or 6 shots. An advanced killing machine that can't kill with 1 bullet? Even when Arnie said in the last film he had detailed files on human anatomy.<br/><br/>The next chase sequence where the sun seems to rise very fast is lifted wholesale from Terminator 2. It's far too similar, showing lack of creativity. Having the Doctor from Terminator 1 & 2 shows a nice bit of continuity.<br/><br/>And the T-X killing Kate's boyfriend is just like the T1000 killing John's foster parents. Not a new idea. I had to double take and think when I saw the T-X dressed as Kate (she pulls her out of the truck near the start, that's when she touches her. Where she could have easily killed her as well). Also the fact that this multi-million dollar US Government secure installation, Kate gets into a seemingly very high security area so easily? I think not.<br/><br/>And that they don't seem to have any bespoke Anti-virus software or any contingency plans for a virus or a system collapse? Like a back-up system, or the ability to kill all operations without using Skynet? Give me a break!<br/><br/>The whole magnet thing was utter garbage. If the T-X was being subjected to high levels of magnetism she'd shut down. Computers and chips don't like magnets! And how did Arnie get to the surface without passing the magnet? Wouldn't the T-X use a safer route as well as she's a newer model (just another indication that she isn't the latest model).<br/><br/>Also why Kate isn't starting up the plane as John is clearing everything from the ground. The World's about to end and their on a dead-line and she's taking her time, why? I'll assume the T-X learns where they are going from Arnie's memory when she re-programs him. Now he's in the helicopter with her so why he doesn't try and blow her up while their in flight? And she found a helicopter already with fuel in it? The end of the film is pretty dire. <br/><br/>Skynet has gotten itself into computers so there's no core. No Big deal. It just started a Nuclear War! When bombs drop you get EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse) That fries computers. The only systems that would then hold Skynet would be in the bunkers where the humans are hiding. All that means is they yank their power for a few vital seconds and then the only place Skynet could still be, is in the satellites.<br/><br/>No worries. Just never build anything that uses those frequencies or fire a few missiles into space at them. Or get whoever is in the International Space Station to shut them down. Then NO Skynet.<br/><br/>That's the biggest mistake of the film, none of the writers seem to know what would happen to computers and databases after a nuclear attack. Piece of cake. The so-called ""inevitable"" has just been derailed by me very easily. In a matter of moments, because I bothered to use my brain.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl was rubbish. Arnie was fair to middling. Kristina Lokken was awful. Clare Danes was utterly awful. This film could have been so much better. Shame it wasn't.<br/><br/>Hopefully the script writers read these reviews? Learn about EMP boys?"

","When Terminator 3 finally launched in theaters, my friend and I were beside ourselves with excitement. After all we were and still are two of the biggest Terminator fans on the planet. T1 and T2 were superb! Awesome story, awesome action, awesome visual effects. Too bad T3 ended up mediocre... While boasting the most impressive visual and CGi effects of the trilogy (this is evident by the increased number of T800 Terminators on screen at once at the beginning of the movie)the script was basically just the T2 script taken and changed here and there. Its the year 2004 and John Connor, leader of the human resistance is now in his 20s. Even after the destruction of the Cyberdyne computers in T2, John still feels unsafe and so is a simple bum who lives off the grid so no computer network can locate him. As with T1 and 2 a Terminator (TX) arrives from the future to hunt down the human saviour and terminate him. Thankfully Big Arnie is back, and once again steps up to the plate as Johns protector. The movie is basically then just degraded into a bunch of highly explosive and action packed sequences, eventually leading to the flicks climax when Skynet becomes self aware and begins taking over. If i haven't already said so, T3, Like Jurassic Park 3, disappointed me a hell of a lot. While boasting the most impressive spesh fx of their respective trilogies, the overall qualities of the films is subpar, and T3 is degraded into a simple beer-and-pretzels action romp. Average at best, though still worth a rental."

","If a sequel was going to be made, then it should have had the same director as the first two, James Cameron, then maybe it would have been better than this attempt by Jonathan Mostow. Basically John Connor (Nick Stahl) has spent years hiding himself away from Skynet, no phone, no address and no destination. So instead of trying to find and kill him, the new advanced (female looking) villain machine, the T-X (Kristanna Loken) comes from 2029 to 2003 to kill his Connor's future commanders. She does eventually find Connot though, when after he broke into a pet store, run by Katherine 'Kate' Brewster (Romeo + Juliet's Claire Danes), she finds his blood (on a bandage), and she now on his hunt. Terminator also finds him and they are now on the run from the T-X. They do stop to Sarah Connor's grave (died of disease), but it is not her body, but a mound of guns. The Terminator tells them that they have to escape the blast of the nuclear missiles, which strike soon, and this will begin Judgement Day (which was only postponed), but John insists that they get to the place where Skynet will operate and take over, where Kate's father, Robert Brewster (David Andrews) is trying to stop it. In the end, after escaping the rampaging/attacking machines, and after the Terminator and T-X die together, John and Kate realise that they were not meant to stop Judgement Day, only to survive it in Crystal Peak. Also starring Mark Famiglietti as Scott Petersen and Earl Boen as a brief Dr. Peter Silberman. It is not brilliant like the other two, it is just an excuse for some giggles, the same stuff we've seen before with a few cool moments, and only Arnold Schwarzenegger returning as another good Terminator and the special effects are impressive.

"firestarchaotix","6","0","1","15 September 2005"," Promising but flawed
","In watching this film i had indeed had high hopes, sadly yes i was disappointed but there is something a story there underneath the surface which had promise. The Terminatrix is an interesting addition to the series, some may say pointless and merely a backwards step, however this is not the case. The Terminatrix is a mixture of both the Terminator models from the first movies and has additional inbuilt weapons would do make for a more powerful enemy. However this is not very well executed and with more work and direction could have been an astounding piece of film folklore in a similar way to the T1000 from T2. The action sequences whilst fun, did not rival the impact of sequences past. This is primarily where the movie fails. With more focus these sequences could have been key in establishing the movie as a must see film. The music score is also passable at best. Whereas in T2 again, the music score built the tension up and made you feel that you were along for the ride as well. In this movie however, you will barely notice that it is there, this is a massive disappointment. The film also is very short, the previous two films being well over 2 hours, this goes little over 1 and a half and feels rushed. The ending of the film however is a shock to the system and a completely UN-Hollywood ending, a very good surprise which leaves the door open if necessary for another sequel. Overall, the ideas are good, with more work and care it could have stood out like its predecessors, however sadly it falls rather flat. Check it out but do not expect more than an average flick."

Although her character was made to be ""tougher"" than the Terminator it still makes you laugh. I see this as a serious movie not one where you crack some jokes - not at least at the Terminator's expense.<br/><br/>On a positive note this may set up a base for T4 and hopefully someone may bring it back to level we know it as.......<br/><br/>The movie is enjoyable but for me, not as 1 and 2."

","John Connor, a resistance leader of the future, is being pursued by the T-X, an ultra-sophisticated terminator cyborg sent from the future with a mission to kill him. He and a childhood friend are being protected by another terminator while trying to escape the T-X and avert a nuclear holocaust caused by Skynet, a US military computer network.<br/><br/>This movie has the standard modern-day Hollywood blockbuster virtues and vices - it's great-looking, fast-paced and has some terrific action and special effects, but the plot is a lame rehash of another movie (in this case, Terminator 2: Judgement Day), the characters are uninteresting and the film lacks any kind of depth or atmosphere. If only they'd stop making movies by committee, with three writers and nine producers, and give the director some creative control. However, there is a lot to enjoy in this film - Loken is wonderful as the sinister T-X, cheerfully murdering people and reprogramming machines to do her bidding, and it's fun to see a petite girl in a jumpsuit throwing big Arnie around. The stuntwork by Simon Crane is fantastic, as are the visual effects by Pablo Helman, Don Taylor and Stan Winston, and there are some great sets, costumes and chases, especially when the T-X hijacks a crane and destroys half of downtown Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger gives it his all (this was his last movie before being elected Governor of California) but was much better in the original movie as the bad guy, romantic leads Stahl and Danes do what they can with their ropey dialogue (""It all makes sense now !!""), and Boen has an offbeat cameo reprising his character from the previous two movies. An enjoyable flick, but check out the original The Terminator instead - that movie had a tiny fraction of the budget of this one, but a great story, real characters, style and atmosphere.

","The 2nd sequel to the original '84 sci-fi thriller and follow-up to the '91 sequel was a long time coming, perhaps a few years too long. That could be the main reason the Linda Hamilton character is missing. They managed to eke out a respectable big-budgeter still superior to most of the other action thrillers coming out in the nineties, and especially nowadays, but right off the bat it lacks some of the innovations in the previous sequel. Arnold just duplicates his cyborg character from 1991, perhaps even a bit less human in quality. The new TX super-villain, in female form, is just a bit more advanced than the T-1000, with fancy new weapons and an ability to control other machines (wow, who saw that coming?). The first few minutes essentially duplicate the beginning of the '91 film. The writers seem unable to come up with anything new at this point, even though they had a dozen years. I was dismayed to hear the TX utter one of her first lines and realize it copied one of best lines in ""The Hidden""(87), which itself emulated the first Terminator film. Or, she's just copying the T-1000. Same difference.<br/><br/>Another big drawback is the central character of John Connor (Stahl). You get the sense that if he wasn't forced into his destiny as a military leader and messiah, he'd end up as a typical loser in a dead-end job, if not homeless. It's as if he's given up or something; where is the kid who could out-think most adults in the previous movie? I guess it's fashionable to create these loser-type characters in Hollywood's screen writing 101 classes who then do a miraculous turnaround, but it's also tiresome. Connor obviously feels something bad may still occur, otherwise he wouldn't be living 'off the grid.' Shouldn't he be using his brain and talents to keep track of developments in advanced computers which may pose a danger? This seems a motivation not thought out, as in the previous 2 pictures; does he think Judgement Day will happen at the start of the film or not? Of course, it's revealed his mom passed away not long ago, which may explain his despair, as Arnold calls it, but it's never delved into.<br/><br/>All that being said, Stahl does a pretty good job of conveying the world weariness associated with someone too young to have so much baggage. You warm up to his character very quickly and are following along through his eyes most of the time. Danes is surprisingly energetic in a role she nabbed in the last minute, I hear. And Loken as the new Terminatrix? She sure has the look; I suppose it's interesting to see a female figure with so much power. The FX are consistently impressive. Mostow is a very good director, and this film could be a case study of seeing the difference between a very good director and a great director (James Cameron). It's fascinating to wonder how much more, if anything, Cameron could have done with the existing material. As mentioned, this film lacks some of the surprises and suspense of the first two; for example, there's never any doubt as to who is the heroic cyborg and which is the nasty one. Mostow basically steered a straight course toward the one point where the audience is unclear of what may happen, the very conclusion. There is where you may find some surprises."

","The original film was ""WOW!"". The first sequel too but with an lighthearted injection of fun. This second sequel (T3) inspires the same exclamation but purely for the mystery that it was ever made at all. OK that IS a bit rough, but forgive me for ever thinking the T2's ""Dark Road At Night"" ending provided some finality to the story! According to Terminator 3, you can't beat fate after all, and Arnie is back for the ride. Skynet was of course smarter than the heroes thought and is up to it's old time traveling tricks again. This time it sends back a girl Terminator and 'luckily' the good guys manage (again) to send back their own as well, in the form of Arnie (again).<br/><br/>Yes, a whole manner of repetition, but sadly the greatness of the first two isn't part of that. Granted, there is some great action such as a fantastic car chase, and there are some good one liners from Arnie (isn't that a given?), but the story is beyond 'paint by numbers. Most of the characters exist only to the further of the plot and many of those advancements are just end up being far too convenient. Finally, without spoiling it, the ending just isn't as well thought out as it could have been. It poses an idea that while clever at first, falls apart under scrutiny.<br/><br/>When it comes to the crunh, Terminator 3 is a simpe action romp with some great effects and visuals. It is good to see Arnie reprise his role as the T800. However, to be part of the Terminator series, I feel that a film has to more than that and more sophisticated than this derivative sequel. Watch for the sake of completion, but just like Alien Resurrection, this film is a bit of a blight.<br/><br/>****SPOILER****<br/><br/>The rationale of the film was that Skynet used the Internet to survive destruction, by copying itself onto thousands, if not millions of computers around the world. The idea is that, like the Internet, Skynet couldn't be destroyed completely - break one part of the web and the system can connect via another route. It is a great idea but after the world is decimated by nuclear war, where does all the electricity come from to run these computers and thus maintain the Internet? Forget for a moment that the infrastructure the network depends on would be severely damaged. Skynet, future ruler of the world and humanity, is going to try to take control on a handful of Pentium 2's with dial-up connections? Remember, it is 1999 in this film.<br/><br/>****SPOILER COMPLETE****"

"Allen-31","2","0","1","2 May 2005"," how they should have done it
","What a piece of trash. It's nothing more than a film that tried to outdo the action sequences of its two predecessors. No characters development. In fact, it more features character un-development as we see Jon Connor go from amazingly cool kid with budding leadership qualities in ""T2"" to whiny 20-something wuss in this movie.<br/><br/>And it also seems that the director went to great pains to undo the time travel logic of the first two films. Time travel stories naturally have to deal with paradox, but you can't resolve paradox one way then turn around and throw that reasoning out the window in favor of another explanation. They did, and it completely undermined the reasons why we were told the first two stories happened. As it stands, Jon Connor had nothing to fear from the Terminatrix. If fate is after all inescapable as Arnold declared, then Jon could've walked right up to the Terminatrix and planted a big IL' kiss right on her lips and she would have still not been able to kill him because he was fated to be the leader of the future resistance having survived nuclear Armageddon with knowledge of how to fight the machines. Stupid.<br/><br/>If they'd wanted to keep in line with the idea that fate can be changed, then here is a much better idea that could have been a plot device to make an exciting ""T3"" movie:<br/><br/>Jon is in his 20s. A third T-100 comes back and informs him that new information uncovered AFTER the dispatching of the first two protectors is that one last Terminator was sent back, but its primary mission was to first protect Cyberdine's existence, then eliminate John immediately following the nuclear strike. Cyberdine executives, understanding how radical the research their company was doing, had made extensive back-ups of the information thought destroyed in the previous movie. After the destruction of the main lab in T2, further research was shifted to the military when Cyberdine reformed as an exclusive military contractor whose existence is classified so as to be protected from future ""terrorist"" threats.<br/><br/>The plot could have been just as exciting and action packed, but with a new formula. Instead of running AWAY from the enemy terminator, John, the T-100 and supporting cast would be on the offensive actively trying to bring Cyberdine down while the T-1000 or T-X or whatever is disguising itself as a military/Cyberdine big shot and doing everything to ensure Judgement Day and still try to eliminate John so he can't lead the humans to victory 20 years later.<br/><br/>Ah, what could have been..."
"cnyldz","4","0","1","25 April 2005"," why did you make this movie?
","Once upon a time there was a movie called "" Terminator 2: Judgement Day "" and it was watchable nice movie. Then the makers of that movie didn't think that the money they earned from this movie wasn't enough and you know what kind of a money I am talking about... Then they made this following movie "" Terminator 3: The Rise of The Machines "" and they made the 2. movie loose its good appearance on people' s minds. I only vote this movie 4 points because the special effects are very good. But the scenario is really awful... And I also protest Arnold Schwarzenegger by not watching his movies anymore because of supporting a holocaust which DOES NOT EXIST. I think he should read more history books instead of spending time on body building, before starting to support an idea like that."
"parhat","5","0","1","19 April 2005"," What the Community are Complaining
","There has been a few edited parts of Terminator done by the internet forum community. So I will address this. The major theme that seems to hit hard and what the community has done was to re-edit the entire movie where the T-X original program was to upload the virus program onto the mainframe as one of the beginning sequences, and her first choice after that was to find John Connors FIRST, instead of running around shooting high school students which is what supposed to be after that. In fact the internet community, and I agree with them, is that Kate Brewster was an absolute drag to the entire movie and as a result was completely removed from the original movie remake done by this small fan community. Most people who are fans of Terminator aren't the kind of people who watch it once or twice, they can watch, 10 or 20 times. Whenever that is done several scenes become extremely irritating, too long or too short. They kind of stand out like a sore thumb. Those include, Arnie wearing Elton John's Sunglasses, T-X machine's breast size increase, and corny lines about ""I like your car/bike"", and ""you got a big gun"". Cheesy lines simply won't do. It didn't display any intelligence as ""I'll be back"" as in the original Terminator 1 franchise. Overall, if I have to see this movie, I really have to watched the re-edited version (done by myself or community) or it's a torture to watch. The biggest problem I have regarding Terminator 3 are: 1) John Connors is Stupid and way too weak 2) Kate Brewster's a real drag to the entire movie. and 3) T-X machine is too busy killing small cockroaches (e.g. John Connor's friend) instead of trying to find John Connors first or show she was uploading some virus program. The movie, I believe runs too short and the scene where the crane runs demolishing the city is way too long. It's an overkill and cheesy. The decision by Arnie where he wanted to add the extra scene was helpful when his body is crushed through the crane going in the building. Unfortunately the rest of the city demolishing is unnecessary. Kate Brewster scene can be eliminated entirely. There's no place for her in John Connor's life (romance with this woman is out of the question), at least for Terminator 3, because it makes John Connors look like a wimp. This is not just my opinion, but a opinion of a fan community that has to gross out and watch this movie over and over. Mind you, it's a minority who does this, but certain parts really are irritating. How would you like to see Arnie wear Elton John's Sunglasses 20 or 30 times like me? LOL."
"j_graves68","5","0","1","11 April 2005"," how do you re-invent the wheel?
","When I heard that James Cameron wasn't helming this third installment, I didn't expect it to be very good. And I was right. How do you re-invent the wheel with the shock waves he brought us with Terminator 2? (Still one of my favorites). At the end of T2, there was an element of hope that was instilled by the actions of the Terminator, John, and Sarah Connor and the destruction of CyberDyne. Well, fast-forward to this movie, and the writers simply tell us that ""judgement day is inevitable"". Okay, then I guess that means we should have another sequel to milk this franchise for everything it has. I wouldn't be surprised if this turned up as a Saturday morning cartoon, too. So back to the important point that the writers probably thought the audience wouldn't realize about the future: time is always in transit in motion- and the future is compiled by what happens in the present. There is no set unprecedented event that will happen regardless.<br/><br/>Another flaw that was never explained (not much really was in this film and instead left to clever one-liners, ""talk to the hand""), was how did the government all of the sudden after the demise of CyberDyne conjure up all of this spectacular and much more sophisticated technology on such short notice? And why did the Terminator have to go into another bar as soon as he arrived, get the same kind of clothes, and the director even threw in a comic relief gag when leaving...Hmm, I keep thinking of the second one...John Conner was a whiny wimp, and I never believed for a second that this was the future leader of the free world. Claire Danes had more balls than him. I'm not saying Nick Stahl wasn't a good choice (I saw him in ""Bully""& he was a bastard), but if the writer(s) gave him a front-row seat (like they did with Edward Furlong)instead of playing the helpless b$#ch, I think it would've helped in becoming a better film. Claire Danes was on her way to becoming the next Sarah Conner, and the TX wasn't very threatening. No special powers to speak about aside from controlling machines. Did I see that once on the Sci-Fi channel? Once again, it was the work of the writers/producers condescending to the audience thinking sex appeal would sell more tickets. I think it did. The film had a look to it as if it were an early-eighties, made-for-TV flick, whereas T2 had blues, metallic greys, and shadows. This didn't feel like a Terminator movie.<br/><br/>I really hope they don't make a Terminator 4 and chip away some more @ Cameron's reputation and our intelligence.<br/><br/>A day or so after I saw this, I was talking to someone about it, expecting them to tell me how they were disappointed they were in the flick, but they said the opposite! Guess they don't get out much!<br/><br/>And I guess she's the kind of person filmmakers of this dreck want in their test audiences. You really CAN fool all the people some of the time!"

","Where is story line? I have always loved the Terminator movies (women know why) but this just lacked the story line! It was just Arnold kicking butt, which we see in every Arnold movie. I have to admit the special affects were great and the cleverness and creativity was not that bad but the story went no where. The only thing that kept you watching the movie was to see the stunts, affects, and violence. Definitely not a movie for kids under seven. Nick Stahl, playing John Connor, does a fantastic job! Bravo!Bravo! Encore! Encore! But like I said before no story line, James Cameron is losing his touch. Everyone who has seen the first two movies can only guess what the third is like.

"silent_poet04","6","0","1","5 April 2005"," A Good Movie, yet A Flawed Story
","When I first heard of Terminator 3, I must say that I was surprised. Didn't the second one sum everything up nicely? I went to see the film with a large amount of doubt and misgivings. However, I was surprised. The acting was pretty decent (except for Claire Danes, ugh) and Nick Stahl does a decent job of portraying John Connor. The Terminatrix is sleek and powerful, and the creativity behind this machine is very well thought out. <br/><br/>However, there is a major hole in this story. <br/><br/>One of the beginning lines is this: John Connor says that ""when I was 13, another Terminator was sent to kill me as a teenager. I was protected by a Terminator."" However this cannot be true because of the simple fact that in T1, it begins in May 1984 (dialogue between Reese and the cop says so) so therefore Sarah could not have given birth to John until 1985. In fact in T2, when Robert Patricks liquid terminator character looks John up in the police computer, it says John birthday is 2/10/85. So, when John was 13 that would make the year 1998. Wait just a minute though. Judgement Day, according to Arnold's character, occurs on August 27, 1997. Whoa, talk about not thinking through the entire story before you write it! Holy snap! Also, in T3, Sarah Connor dies in 1997. Believable, only except for the fact that John says in T3 that Sarah battled Leukeimia for 3 years after the doc gave her 6 months to live. So, if the T3 storyline is true, Sarah died when John was 16! In 2001! But she couldn't have died then because in T2 Judgement day was supposed to happen August 27, 1997. Yes, I know they stopped it and all that, but apparently, the writers in T3 had that happen in 1998. So apparently the writers could have done a lot better job. In fact, another thing is John is supposed to be 23 in this movie. That would make the year 2008. So if John was born in 1985 (according to information given in T1 and T2) that would make the information (age-wise) accurate. So why the heck couldn't they make everything else accurate? Let's just hope that for T4 (which is in production) that they think the script through a little bit better, and try to keep it true to the story that James Cameron developed. Let's face it, his was a lot better.<br/><br/>The SFX were incredible, especially the high speed chase scene about half an hour in. The story (except for the flaws mentioned above) was touching and remarkably well done. I loved the ending scene, where you see the nuclear warheads falling at various locations around the world. Overall this was not a terrible movie. I don't think it held up to the first two, but it is a good continuation. <br/><br/>My Rating: **1/2 out of ****"

","-Spoiler for T2 as well- You know why James Cameron wasn't directing, right? Good, we can get straight to the point then.<br/><br/>In the ending of T2, John Connor and Terminator eliminated all possibility of Skynet and Judgement Day happening. Thereby changing the future by altering the past, a popular SFI-FI time travail concept.<br/><br/>The series would have been fine if they left it, but they didn't, they had to go into the other time travail concept; You can't change the past. So they just HAD to bring back the Terminator, completely screwing up the canon of the series; ""They sent back two terminators"" (Opening lines of T2) and they also just HAD to have a female Terminator, which is fine, but with the whole ""you've got to travail in the buff"" thing, they also probably HAD to focus on TX's behind, I don't remember if they did or not though.<br/><br/>In fact, they only real good parts of T3 were the special effects, which were nothing special.<br/><br/>T3 is not my first choice."
"agorelik","5","0","1","21 December 2004"," Extremely Mediocre
","Above all, this movie even failed to create (for me) any real sense of urgency or excitement. Which is the essential point behind an action movie.<br/><br/>Some of the problems inherent in Terminator 3 <br/><br/>1. Essentially, the plot is wrong. Terminator 3 negates the positive vision of the previous two movies (that Sarah and John Connor can prevent or at least seriously influence the future). T3 abandons that vision for a entirely fatalistic one (that, in fact, Judgement Day cannot be prevented or even really influenced).<br/><br/>2. The timing and pacing of the movie just seem off. The car cash sequence runs on too long, the battle in the bathroom runs on too long, the robo-tanks are boring, the Skynet ""planes"" are easily destroyed, etc.<br/><br/>3. The new Terminatrix is essentially the same as T-1000 in T2, so she's literally boring, whereas the T-1000 is really new and exciting in T2. You're frequently surprised by the T-1000 in T2 whereas you're just bored by the Terminatrix in T3. The acting by Robert Patrick was quite good (really effective in being scary and mechanical), whereas Kristana Loken is just.........well, I just wasn't scared or even impressed.<br/><br/>4. The plot was muddled so that it felt both boring (repeats in many aspects T2) and just messy, so you never really felt the suspense which was very pronounced in the first two movies.<br/><br/>5. Claire Danes was a poor substitute for Linda Hamilton. Again, Linda Hamilton brought an unusual range of depth of emotion for an action movie. Claire Danes was just your archetypal cardboard damsel in distress.<br/><br/>6. The action sequences were simply not that impressive. If you notice, while in T1 and T2, the characters were really fighting for their lives - they're wounded, bloody, covered in debris and sweat, really battered. In T3, the only thing the hero John Connor suffers is that the Terminatrix breaks his leg at the very end of the movie. Kate Brewster isn't even scratched. You never get the sense that their lives are truly in danger. In fact, the Terminatrix and John Connor only come face to face twice (both for extremely short segments) and she doesn't even wound him (until the very end of the movie).<br/><br/>Overall, this was a really mediocre movie."

","Hey, I really liked Terminator 3, but no historic milestones here. Kristanna Loken, now my favorite evil cyborg, is also easy on the eyes. Like Arnold, her acting leaves something to be desired but their characters are emotionless machines, after all...well almost. T-X departs from the standard set by Terminator 1 & 2 in that she IS equipped with RAGE. Previous Terminators were supposed to be unfeeling killing machines determined to carry out their directives, although Arnold's character does develop a degree of compassion starting in 2.<br/><br/>Great special effects, gratuitous cyber-violence, and even a surprise ending combine to make this one fun to watch. The prolonged fight scene in the restroom has comedy; the T-X instantly rolling back onto the moving truck is wicked cool, and Arnold hanging from the crane is both!"

More interesting to watch and not as manipulative as his movies. I always feel a bit fooled the second time I watch one of his movies because they suddenly feel so empty. All the splendor is gone. T 3's main characters actually feel like humans - not like the caricatures that Cameron tend to rely on. The movie also has a nice Japanese feel to it.

The entire concept has a main fault. In Terminator 2, the robots failed to kill John Connor as a kid. Why are they sending a robot back into the past when he is grown up? He will probably be more prepared and ready for facing another terminator. I would have sent the new terminator into the past when Sarah Connor was a kid or even earlier when she was being born.<br/><br/>What I liked were the old terminators in the movie and Nick Stahl was really great.<br/><br/>What I did not like was the stupid sun glasses joke, the action scene in witch the T-101 is hanging on a vehicle which is just the equivalent of the truck chase in part 2, the scene when the T-101 has a malfunction and tries to eliminate John Connor and the entire movie... ... this is just pop corn cinema ignoring the higher needs concerning an intelligent plot for the real fans of the Terminator series.

Don't insult Jennifer, she takes chances with her roles and she has never annoyed me in the way Clare Danes does in this movie. SPOILERS!!!  Other then her the movie is pretty good as far as movies like this are concerned. We have Arnold returning again and again and again...he must of been offed in this movie about 400 times but he comes BACK.  The Terminatrix is pretty interesting,  she is a lean mean killing machine who Arnold says in indestructible but we know different.  This movie is basically a Fail Safe type movie.  Computer virus takes over the worldwide defense system (skynet). And it turns on itself so it can annihilate all humans.  So of course Clare Danes and John Conner are the only 2 people who can thwart this and Arnold has to save them so they can have children and lead the resistance. There is some anti war Dr Strangelove type ending pasted on.  All I have to say is if John Connor has to be stuck in a fall out shelter and spend the rest of my life with the Clare Danes character I would take my chances with the nuclear bombs if I was him."

There are some fun action scenes, a fair amount of amusing jokes referring to the previous movie and a really hot evil robot played by a model whose vacuous model stare works perfectly in the role.<br/><br/>But no, it's not as good as the first two. Those movies moved like lightning, offering a breakneck speed that kept you from catching your breath. T2 was a thrill ride from beginning to end, and T3 never works up that sort of momentum. Its holes are easier to pick at than the previous movies (although not terrible by action movie standards) and the ending is downright disappointing. But if rather than comparing it with two of the best action films ever made, you compare it with more typical action flicks, it's superior to many, a good but not great movie that is energetic fun most of the time with some terrific moments here and there. Yes, it would have been better directed by James Cameron rather than some director so obscure that I don't know how he finagled the job, but it's still effectively directed. Just lower your expectations a little bit and watch it."

Even Arnold Schwarzenegger,the man we have come to know and love as the T100,doesn't quite seem the same anymore.The computer generated special effects are just a little too obvious for my taste,and the entire film takes on the feel of a small,made for cable,or straight to video dud instead of a big screen blockbuster.I don't watch very many sequels, because they all too often disappoint me and ruin my memory of the previous film.I thought,in this case that since the second film surpassed the first in terms of quality viewing,that this third installment would at least measure up to one of those two.Much to my dismay,I was wrong.If this film could not have been directed by Cameron, it should have been given to someone on the same class as him,such as Ridley Scott.Perhaps it would have stood a better chance of being good."
"abyboom-1","7","0","1","29 March 2004"," How to pass Judgement on the Day I saw T3?
","********** Spoilers ********<br/><br/>Well, what can I say? It's still Terminator chasing Terminator and John, plus a host of new chracters. Mind blowing Action and FX and Arnold back in his Terminator boots is good enough for a funtime movie with popcorn.<br/><br/>However, that not what I expect from a T movie. I am a siccccckkk fan of T movies, and to speak the truth after watching T3, I was not sure whether I was dissappointed or satisfied.<br/><br/>I was very happy to see that it wasn't a complete dud like the Matrix Movies and also in the fact that making a Terminator sequel (especially after the emmensly successful T2), would be a very difficult proposition (especially with mentor Cameron not around), it doesn't fail to catch attention.<br/><br/>What makes it disappointing is that it tries to make a mirrior image of T2. Now it's impossible to make something similar to T2 and not get criticised. T2 was perfect. And one can't beat perfection. And after waiting for all these years and watching T2 for around 100 times, I really wasn't hoping to see another T2 look-alike.<br/><br/>Arnold's grown older in the years and he seems tired, but still delivers. What makes the film so weak is the script. It just looks like a concatenation of great action sequences one after the ohter. By the time you start comprehending it, lo! it's over.<br/><br/>The film should have had a much longer run-time with space given to character interactions, which is totally absent in the movie. Plus, there are no sub-plots which takes your attention away from the main theme as so cleverly applied in T2. what made T2 stand alone shining in spite of T1's brillance, was the fact that it ultimately showed a new aspect of the Terminator, which was not viewed in T1. So that given away, and the audience knowing more or less all about T800 thanks to the previous movies, there was not much that T 800 could bring new in this movie. Especially, what I hated most was the slap stick humor of the terminator which is not expected from him. I mean, c'mon he's a killing machine deviod of any human interaction, how can he have humor? The T's humor in T2 stood apart beacuse it was incorporated situations where his brutality and ignorance of humans made it look humorous, rather than making it crack ludicrous jokes like ""Talk to the Hand"". I mean, if someone asks a terminator for money, what do u expect from it? Either, it kills him or if he's a good terminator gives a stare such that the quails way from him! but not here.<br/><br/>Also, there are couple of situations in the movie which has been borrowed straight from Arnold's Commando. The car driving downhill amidst trees and the line ""I lied"". Not original at all! Again, some of Arnold's one liners are really inappropiate to the situation.Consider this: kate's father has just been hit by TX, T800 blast her off an elevator shaft, and while Kate's dad is in death thores what does he do? Does he go near him and tries to see what the injury is all about? No way- he stays there and says - ""She will be back"". I mean who gives a damn at that instant for that line!<br/><br/>Now coming to John Connor! well, if this idiot is to be the leader of human resistance, God save us! The John we witnessed in T2 shows a rebelious quality and self proficency that made the audience feel like that he could be a leader in the future. Even at that age he single handly escapes the T1000 in a bike initially and gives insights into what needs to done correctly at times even when the adults were faultering (one instance that stands apart is the sequnces of T800's chip destrcution by Sarah!). Well, the T3 John is a confused mess. Not only does he try to scare Kate with a phony Gun, but also gets locked up by kate in a Dog cell! now, if you know that JD will not happen , you should be happy about it and go on with your life as a normal person. Again, if you are apprehensive about JD you should be doubly cautious about your surroundings, rahter than being a mess as portrayed in T3. Even at the finale, it is Kate who tells him what they were actually doing in the shelter! the idiot couldn't derive it on it's own. Also, if the leader of human resistance gets killed by a Terminator during the war beacuse he had ""weakness"" towards it, maybe skynet should not have bothered to sent 3 terminators in the past to kill such a wreck!<br/><br/>
Next: Sarah Conner is missing having died of Leukemia! kate tries to fill in as a proxy for that strong female lead, and to tell the truth she does much better than John. but of course, she's no Sarah conner! maybe, if the script had been a bit more strong it would have had a better potrayal of her, which once again bring us back to the script! Was it really necessary to make T3 after such a brilliant and conclusive ending in T2? For my money: No. but then, T3 does bring in some refreshment in terms of concepts (it adds to a lot of confusion and inconsistencies as well!). It does try to put in the humanity angle a bit more than have been shown in the earlier T movies (totally absent in T1, but then t1 wasn't about humanity, it was about T800). They could have tried to propound it more in the movie and cut out the humor. (T movies are not meant to be funny). The greatest zenith in the movie is of course the TX. i mean, when you are going ga ga on a killer over it's sexuality, it's really impossible to fear it , something that was inspired by the previous terminators. And to be very frank, I could not see how Tx was more efficient that T1000 in weapons department except for it's hand doing some funny things. The intrinsic superioirty (if any) of TX over T1000 can never be seen ( Maybe the script wrtier could not come up with something better, viz., a lump of energy as was previously thought to be done). when you watch T1000 you directly see how superior it is to the previous T800. Well, i could see much of TX being superior to T1000. If someone do see it pleadse let me know!<br/><br/>Finally, after all the bad pionts, the good point: the ending. Poetic, brilliant, but a comes a bit too late to repair the damage that has been done before, a saving grace one can say for the T series. It is totally open ended and gives a very good platform for anothet T movie. Now I know, that pulling it a bit, but if Mr. cameron can once again reprise his role as the captain of the terminator ship, and given due hard work, T4 will stand better than T3. And only then can the existence of T3 be justified."

And I personally thought it was as good as the first Terminator movie.<br/><br/>We had awesome action sequences(especially the chase with the crane!), witty one-liners(which every Arnold movie MUST have!), and a decent plot that didn't seem as depressing as one would think it would be. Nick Stahl was great as John Conner. He's a better actor than Edward Furlong, although he doesn't look much like what Eddy looks like. Claire Daines' character was a good new character too. The T-X was the hottest robot I've ever seen, and she was one tough machine! But I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of her, and focused more on the plot of judgement day. <br/><br/><br/><br/>And the twist of the T-800(Arnold) killing John Connor in the future, as well as judgement day actually happening sets us up for a great new kind of new Terminator movie for T4(if it gets made), because it could take place in a post-apocolyptic world with the human surviors battling against the machines. It wouldn't be the classic ""good terminator gets sent back in time to protect Connor/bad terminator gets sent back in time to kill Connorz"" scenario.

","Where to start? I tend to agree with other reviewers (and James Cameron) that there was no really compelling reason to make this film. This one, thematically, mirrors the previous one. And also, like, for instance, the third ""Lethal Weapon"" movie, this third ""Terminator"" film becomes partly a self-parody. But to give credit where credit is due, the action sequences were very impressive, and the crane chase will be a classic scene. (However, chases in inappropriate vehicles are sort of a trademark sinking into the self-parody mentioned earlier.) Schwarzenegger has found a character that certainly matches his acting ability. It's sort of too bad that he will be too old to ever make another ""Terminator"" film, although that probably wouldn't stop the studio if they thought the money was there. Claire Danes was pretty good here, as was Kristianna Loken. There is plenty of room to quibble about the various time travel paradoxes, and some other plot holes. I have to give the filmmakers some credit for the lack of a typical Hollywood feel-good ending. If you liked the other ""Terminator films, you have to see this one, although it isn't quite the classic that those others are. Grade: B+"
"Algrewehou","10","0","1","3 March 2004"," Definitely the Best Terminator Movie of them All
","I saw the entire trilogy back to back to back. This one was definitely the best. In the first, the music was like something out of a video game and it was more of a ridiculous love story than a science fiction action film. The second film was a little better than the first because it focused more on the time travel aspects and the war in the future. I liked the fact that John Connor was a bit of a motorcycle punk. That's the kind of guy I'd elect to be a military leader, but I didn't like the idea that Sarah Connors was in the insane asylum. In ""Rise of the Machines"", however, it made a terrific link to the war in the future. The terminator (Model # T-X), who was both more powerful and hotter than the other two, had multiple targets and most of them were killed. Therefore, its mission was mostly a success. The only down side to this movie is that the creators brought back THE Terminator, Arnold Scharzenegger. I don't think that Arnold really should be in any more of the Terminatory movies. Finally, after watching this movie, I felt that it could be a good ending, but it could also be added on to. For example, the fourth terminator movie, if there ever will be one, could deal with John not having all the generals he would have had for the war and how humankind can overcome its follies with machines.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10 out of 10. For Terminator fans and general Sci-Fi fans, i would highly recommend this movie. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it to little kids, tho. Hence, the R rating."

","By what right does the third installment of a series whose last entry wrapped ten years ago - a summer popcorn feature, centered around a ""hot chick,"" and produced absent the writer/director who made the legendary originals - have any business being as objectively great as this film?<br/><br/>
Take away the laugh lines - of which there were, admittedly, too many - and you have one of the darkest and most violent science fictions films ever made.  From the brutal assassinations of teenagers in their fast food jobs and make-out parties, to John Connor jamming a loaded pistol into his own temple, to the rampage of the prototypical Skynet killbots, and the inevitable and unstoppable nuclear holocaust, this was far and away the bleakest of the Terminator series.  Nowhere near the emotional weight of the second feature, but also nowhere near the obnoxious childishness it also displayed in parts - had anyone in the audience of T3 felt anywhere near as much loathing for the person of John Connor as they had in T2?<br/><br/>
What action there was, was indeed brilliantly produced - the crane sequence is the best chase filmed in the series to date.  The action, however, was secondary to the critical advancement of the base plotline - we now, at last, have had Judgement Day, and the only place the series could possibly go from here, is to the War of the Machines, for which we have all been waiting.<br/><br/>I had expected little from this film, and avoided it in the theatre.

","Hi all,<br/><br/>After reading some of the other comments on this film, I have determined that most people feel that this film's overwhelming flaw was the absence of James Cameron from its production.  I have already given my reasons for standing up for this GOOD film, and I'm not going to go over them again. However I would like to comment on Mr. Cameron's blind hero worship that most people seem to be guilty of.  <br/><br/>James Cameron is a filmmaker, NOT GOD!  Hell, I'll even go as far to say he's a good filmmaker (and that's pushing it).  But lets all keep things in perspective.  All three T-movies are nothing more then shoot em' up, car chase action fests.  To imply that there is any serous drama injected into any of these films (even the first two) is just silly.  All three films have the combined dramatic warmth of a monster truck rally.  James Cameron brought no real ""SOUL"" to these films... for how can one bring something that does not exist?  We all watch these movies for the same reasons, because we like to see people break really expensive things.  Lets not try to legitimatize the fun of watching an car chase action film by implying that it is dramatic masterpiece.  Every time that happens, I'm sure somewhere an English Lit. Professor is crying."

But when I heard that James Cameron was dropping out, and that John Connor wouldn't be played by Edward Furlong I was a little disapointed, but still excited. However, I was right to be disapointed. Terminator 3 is a good movie in general, but compared to the first two movies, it's crap. There are some OK moments, most movies have them, and even I thought the beginning part with the sunglasses was funny, but the movies aren't made to be funny. They aren't made to mock the first two. The only thing I really liked *****SPOILER***** was seeing the psychiatrist (Dr. Peter Silberman) from the first two films. The ending was also very depressing.

","T3 is still a great movie, and there is a lot to like about it, and I still really enjoyed watching it, however there are some problems with it that make it disappointing for me. Reading some other reviews from people, I can see I am not the only one who had problems with it, and perhaps if James Cameron was on board with this film, it would have been much better.<br/><br/>First, Edward Furlong should have been back for John Connor. I'm not trying to take away anything from Nick Stahl, because he did a great job. In fact, he looked somewhat like a younger Kyle Reese, and at times, even looked like Furlong himself, but why didn't they just get Ed back for the 3rd - it would have been that much better if they had.<br/><br/>Next, was the fact that the T-101 was still trying to be like the T-101 from the second film, despite the fact that it was a different cyborg. Why was it still copying the behaviour that it's predecessor had been taught then, such as not killing humans and looking for the keys under the sun visor?<br/><br/>
Finally, the movie didn't seem to go for long enough, and the story was quite shallow. Elements of a fantastic story were there, but were only brushed over. The whole thing seemed very rushed and actually I was disappointed when the credits began to roll because I thought there needed to be more to the story.<br/><br/>Having said that, T3 is still a good movie, by all means, I would recommend you see it, especially if you are a fan of the previous 2 films, or love Arnie.

Although there were some novel action scenes, they were nothing really spectacular, and the people scenes lacked interest due to the weak plot.

I'm one of the biggest fans going when it comes to the Terminator series, yet I have not been prejudiced against this movie from the beginning just because James 'Titanic' Cameron wasn't involved. Its his loss not being a part of the 3rd and hopefully 4th movie in some small way. Why do people frown at the thought of a sequel coming out. It extends the emotion that was had in the first movie, which if only small can't be a bad thing. After all it costs about £4 to go see the damn movie, how can that not be money well spent when the package is this good.

","I thought this one would be pretty good, but the previews did not really convey how good it turned out to be.  I also thought it would be that good thanks to its relatively short running time.  It turns out this helps the movie flow really fast and you never find yourself wondering how much time is left.  At least it didn't for me.  This one has Arnold as the Terminator once again being sent back in time to save Conner from an evil Terminator. Well I guess it isn't evil as it is a machine.  Well anyway this time the Terminator doesn't have to long to protect John as the war to end the world, as we know it is really close.  This one is just a great action movie, probably the best one I have seen this entire summer of 2003.  There is a great car chase, one that is even better than the Matrix Reloaded, mainly cause it looks more real, like it is actually happening in a city rather than a road Hollywood built (don't get me wrong though, that one was cool too) and there are other numerous scenes in this one that just keep your attention to the screen.  The T-X is rather cool, but I just don't see her being superior to the T-1000, as it seemed a lot harder to destroy.  Though I thought Kristen did a rather good job similar to Robert Patrick (I think that was his name).  The movie explains some of the plot points I was wondering about too, all in all this movie was very enjoyable and had quite a few humorous moments as well."

","Greetings again from the darkness.  I absolutely loved the first Terminator and thought the sequel was one of the best sequels ever made (outside of ""Godfather II"").  Arnold was born to play this role and seems to enjoy it. However, the act is a bit tired now - and Arnold is looking a little wrinkled for a robot.  Anyway, decent story with Nick Stahl (""In the Bedroom"") as a 20 something John Conner and the always wonderful Claire Danes as the female fill in for the not present Linda Hamilton.  I am really glad Danes is acting full time again.  Although it has been almost 10 years since her TV breakout, she is just now coming in to her own as an actress. ""The Hours"" and ""Igby Goes Down"", along with this performance show she is trying to find her niche.  Very skilled and not bad to look at, the next few roles are crucial to her career as either a star or character actress.  I just hope she continues to produce quality turns.  Model Kristanna Loken is the T-X, or Terminatrix (get it?) who is after John Conner.  A far more powerful and efficient killing machine than Arnold, but somehow she continually falls just short.  Not sure how director Johnathan Mostow (""U-571"") lucked into this gig, but at least he doesn't muck it up.  This is just a story that has had its day and should be appreciated for what it gave us.

"maccaveili","2","0","1","12 July 2003"," Liked it better when it was called T-2
","This movie blew chunks, wanna know why?  Cause until the very end, it was practically identical to T-2.  The chase scene was nothing but destructive, other than alot of buildings and vehicles getting demolished it was ho hum.....I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat or anything.  Basically, a more sophisticated terminator, T-X, comes from the future to kill people, namely John Connor and his future wife.  Arnold, comes back as the ""has been"" terminator (same model as in the other 2 movies) to try to stop the ""faster, stronger, more advanced T-X"".  Ooooooh the drama.....wait this sounds familiar.  The only difference was that this time the ""bad"" terminator was a female. Haven't we seen this plot line already in T-2???<br/><br/>Let me just say that I loved the original Terminator, and I really thought that T-2 was ahead of its time back in the day, and I enjoyed it almost as much as the 1st one because of that.  But Cameron directed those two, not the 3rd one.  These guys look like they couldn't come up with a new way of filming, so just followed the same basic principles that T-2 had.  Trust me when I say that if you've seen T-2, then you've seen T-3 already. <br/><br/>
*******************Spoilers*********************<br/><br/>The only difference is that in T-2, judgement day was averted, in this one judgement still happened, basically nukes were set off all around the world thanks to the machines.  So while judgement day was avoided in T-2, it is learned in this movie that judgement day was only postponed.  I swear that is the only ""new"" idea in T-3 that they used.  It ""could"" have been really cool had the nukes gone off in say the middle of the movie and then we got to see John Connor and his mate still trying to survive the aftermath with a terminator after them....but no.  They didn't even show the nukes going off!!!!  All they did was in the final 2 minutes of the movie, show some mickey mouse grid with lines going across it representing the path of all the nukes so you could get a sense of just how many were set off. Great job Hollywood.  The best aspect of the movie that you could have used, you decided to not even show.  <br/><br/>Basically, it boils down to this.  The future of the humans comes down to the hands of John Connor and his future wife.  After 2 failed attempts to kill Connor in the first two movies, they try again.  Like the 2nd movie, Arnold is sent back from the future to stop the more advanced T-X before she kills her targets.  Like the 2nd movie, it is a ""struggle"" and she is always right behind them just ""ever so close"" but yet not ever close enough to finish the job.  By the end of the movie, just as they ""want"" you to think that the T-X is about to kill her targets (ya as if), Arnold, our hero, saves the day.  Oh ya, and he spouts out yet another dumb one liner like ""you are terminated"" to the other terminator.  <br/><br/>There was one part where the T-X, who can control machines, got to Arnold and was controlling him against Connor and his future wife.  This could have been a cool twist, like a blast from the past from Terminator the original, but no.  This only lasted like a minute or two as Arnold shut himself down so he wouldn't ""fail"" his mission.  So there went that little twist, yet another missed opportunity to make this movie unique. <br/><br/>
God I hope they don't release a 4th one because this is starting to get as predictable as the ""Rocky"" series.  There were attempts at humor in this movie, but they were ""few and far between"" and not very funny even when you saw them.

","If you're looking for mindless, repetitive, and hardly groundbreaking CG action sequences, T3 should give you underwhelming entertainment, and leave you with absolutely nothing, except how the script was approved, to reflect upon. Cameron would be rolling over in his grave (if he were dead) at this piece of marketing garbage. The previous movies' ability to stand on their own, and Judgment Day's excellent departures from the original to make a fresh experience. This commercial fluff was nothing but a money-maker to bridge Cameron's work with the hanging Terminator 4. Not to mention interesting and suspenseful storylines, character's that are a little thicker than cardboard cutouts, and flat out BRILLIANT action sequences, even without the capabilities of today's computer animation.<br/><br/>The reversal's presented in the earlier films (Arnold, the traditional hero, becoming the relentless killing machine in the former, and then turning the tables to become an always-there dependable father figure) were not here. And while you can basically predict the ending's of Cameron's films, you don't see (SPOILERS) Reese or the Terminator's death at the end of each picture. The hack's responsible for this mess could have at least thought about throwing us a curve _somewhere_.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, this is nothing but an expensive and quality piece of mediocre ""fan fiction,"" not part of the actual Terminator continuity. They stopped Judgment Day in movie two, this is just a side story.<br/><br/>Remember: Just because Peter Jackson and the Wachowskis did it, doesn't mean you can."

","Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines<br/><br/>***1/2 stars<br/><br/>Look, I don't mind the first two Terminator movies, I really have nothing against them. Terminator was cool with Schwarzenegger playing the bad guy. Terminator 2: Judgment Day was getting a lot cooler though, with the better special effects, but Rise Of The Machines was just so much better than the other two.<br/><br/>Brilliantly written by Cameron and directed by Mostow, this proved to be a lot better than your average sequel. The new Terminatrix or 'TX' was awesome with weapons she can forge out of her hands.<br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines is about John Connor who is now in his 20's and being chased after by the new Terminatrix. But a new T - 800 is sent back in time to protect John Connor and Kate Brewster who are said to be the key to the future and what they need to protect humans from the rise of the machines.<br/><br/>One thing I can say that I really didn't like is the fact that towards the end of the movie it was getting too soft. But the acting in this movie is really good from pretty much everyone and there are so many special effects throughout the movie that it must have taken some hard work, and it really payed off."

The filmmakers completely fail to create any suspense. There's no character development, there's no plot, so there's nothing to invite the audience into giving a crap about any of the ""characters"". Claire Danes's character shows some promise at the beginning of the film, but her character quickly becomes a simp. Even Arnold gives lame line deliveries, as though he learned his lines right before they rolled camera.

The police psychologist who talks to Claire Danes in the graveyard makes reference to having witnessed the Terminator assault on the police station in the original movie. But in that movie, he leaves just as Arnold enters the station. He's not even there when it all goes down! This blunder epitomizes the whole mess that T3 is - they were too lazy to get it right, they were more interested in coming up with a gag than doing anything dramatically interesting.<br/><br/>By the way, in the ""flash forward"" scenes at the beginning of the movie I thought the guy was the doctor from Star Trek: Deep Space 9. But it's really Nick Stahl.<br/><br/>BTW, Nick Stahl does look like he could be the child of Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton. That's about the only detail of this move that looks like it had any thought given to it. The special effects look fine, but that only matters if they're used in service of a good story. But T3 has never been within two miles of a good story.<br/><br/>Boring! See the first one again instead. I gave this one a 2 out of 10, and that was being generous."

DO NOT expect to get a chance to get up and goto the bathroom.<br/><br/>I've read that some film critics claim that this Terminator doesn't have a story, nor a heart (compared to either of the earlier movies) is rather wrong. The theme of the movie is different from T-1 and T-2.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unlike T-1 and T-2, which have messages of hope during horrible circumstances, T-3 heart lies in inevitability, fate and destiny. John's portrayl of hopelessness is excellent.<br/><br/>*Possible Spoilers*<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The movie does take about 15 minutes to start up, but after that, is excellent. The direction of how the machines take over is brilliant. I was stunned at the portrayl of the actual rise of the machines. Even though there is a lack of future war scenes, the movie makes up in the beginning of the war. I doubt that any director could do a better job.<br/><br/>The only complaints I could have in the movie is the 5 second scene where Arnold puts on his glasses for the first time, which was humorous, but not needed. As well as the fact the movie didn't quite have the B-rated sheen that the first 2 had.<br/><br/>I was suprised at 2 things which pleased me, the suspence and violence.

","Terminator 3 was average at best. This film had no sense of pacing in my opinion and spent no time at all letting us get to know the characters. Cameron's absence was very obvious. Instead of taking time to build up to each climax terminator 3 just threw it all at us in the beginning and then went down hill from there, throwing chase seen after chase seen and battle after battle until the very predictable ending. The TX that was supposed to be all powerful got her ass kicked all the time and didn't fare half as well as the T-1000 did in T2. I felt like i had hardly seen Arnold in the movie and they spent practically no time on the TX at all other than a few stupid scenes where she said ""hey..i like ur bike"" and ""hey i like ur car"". At the end of terminator 2 i felt like i knew the all the character better, terminators and all. This movie didn't allow us to get to know anyone and i felt like the director didn't really care about that aspect of movie making. This movie is a disgrace to the terminator series and has ruined the greatness the series had. If i had never seen the other terminator movies i may have given this movie a 6, but since i have and i love the other two this movie gets a big 4 and a warning to all who love the terminator series and have yet to see this movie.Only watch this movie if u don't care about the other movies or ur really into special effects and explosions and you just want a action movie where no brain activity is required.

"Animsteve","4","0","2","7 July 2003"," A big let down for true fans
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines did not do justice to the series at all. There were more plot holes and mistakes within this movie then I've ever seen in a movie with a budget of 170 million dollars. The problems are consistent throughout. First of all, and the biggest shortcoming, is the fact that James Cameron did not direct this film. This new director who calls himself a true ""fan"" of the series knows nothing about it and nothing about a good movie. The terminator is seen as a running gag, something to laugh at and not something to fear or respect. As far as the TX, she was not acceptable as a killing machine. She inspires no fear and creates no suspense as she chases the main characters. Although she is referred to as the ultimate killing machine, she is inferior to the less advanced T-1000. Nick Stahl, the actor who played John Connor, is not fit to be the future leader in the fight against the machines. He is scared and pretty much just a figure head within the film offering no real development in his role. In fact, no character is developed well in this film and the terminators are much too humanlike. My advice for the true fans of the series is to not bother going to see it. In fact, I am going to pretend this movie never happened. It is not a part of the series to me. After watching the film one thought went through my head, ""What was the point of that movie?"" The answer is to make a quick buck off a big actor and a big title."

","Spoilers!!<br/><br/>  The original is a classic that I have seen one too many times, which made Arnold.  The second film, left its science fiction roots, and became a special effects film, without much of a story. A lot of films have plot holes, but how could John Conners exist without the first film happening. No bratty kid, social cause and effects(ie the security guard why don't I kill, the science guy change of mind), Linda Hamilton giving a PC social lecture, and effects with no need like the truck scene.  T3 had to change from the first 2, and this makes it a strong film. The over the top action scenes add humor for the film.  Arnold acts more like a machine, and becomes a strong secondary character; smart move for Arnold.  It shows he can step back for the good of the film. Arnold's computer behavior is comical!  Most science fiction has philosophy, and this film deals with fatalism.  This film answers the question why does John Conner exist.  As a result of fate, the second film only delayed the inevitable.  One must deal with their fate. Chaos theory with free will creates order to chaos and events unfold.  The strongest part of this film is the believability with the science fiction. In 1984, Sky Net takes over, was science fiction, but with the net, and the grid cyber war, it is possible.  This would damage the financial, power, communications system etc.  I watched a show about cyber war on the Learning Channel, with what the  NSC could do and with Sky net and the virus it is plausible.  Add the sci-fi, time travel and anything is possible.  The ending is mind blowing with fatalism.  7 or 8 out 10."
"ChristianB72-1","6","0","2","7 July 2003"," Underhyped but over-rated
","Terminator 3 is a prime example of what I'd call underhype/over-rate syndrome.  We all saw the awful trailers, we all heard about the troubled production history, and we all knew that James Cameron & Linda Hamilton wouldn't be involved.  Suffice it to say, no one I knew thought this movie was going to be very good.  I held out hope that I'd see a reasonably entertaining action movie.<br/><br/>That's exactly what I saw, . . . barely.  However, I think that the fact that the movie came with such low expectations, has somehow raised a lot of people's opinions of a very mediocre film (73% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes).<br/><br/>But enough about other people's opinions, lets get to mine.  I watched Terminator 3 with a smile throughout most of it. It wasn't a big goofy smile, or a wide-eyed look of awe or shock, but a pleasant, mildly amused smile.  I left the theater entertained, but I almost immediately began to forget the movie I just saw.<br/><br/>I started to think about why my reaction was so luke warm.  I think I can boil it down to this: There wasn't one moment in the movie that thrilled or surprised me.  For a Sci-Fi action movie, let alone the 3rd installment in a series, that's a fatal flaw in my book.  Where did it go wrong? Here's my breakdown:<br/><br/>CHARACTERS: - T101 - Great to see Arnold back as the T-101, I actually liked him better here than I did in T2.  He has a couple of funny lines, but like the rest of the film they are mildly amusing and instantly forgettable. - John Connor - Nick Stahl is less annoying than Edward Furlong but not anymore interesting.  He's actually quite bland and didn't generate empathy for his character. - Kate Brewster - Claire Danes manages to make her more empathetic and engaging than John Connor, but the two characters have zero chemistry together.  Any human drama that might have made the movie more interesting is lost by this fact. - TX - A sorry substitute for Arnold in the 1st film and Robert Patrick as the T-1000 in the 2nd.  She doesn't pull out any awe-inspiringly cool tricks like the T-1000 did, and her stone-cold-menace factor pales in comparison to the T-1000 as well as Arnold in the original.  Granted she had two pretty tough acts to follow, but if the film makers insisted on telling basically the same story for the 3rd time, they had to make up in style and cool effects what they sacrificed in lack of originality and predictability.<br/><br/>Which brings us to STORY: I liked the 1st 2 terminator films, I didn't need to see them AGAIN during the 1st hour of this film.  The first hour had no tension or suspense because I'd seen it all before, and we knew none of the main characters would be killed by the TX anyway.  Had there been any spark of originality here it may have sustained my interest more than it did.  During the last half hour, the story finally goes somewhere new, but by that time even these late developments are utterly predictable.<br/><br/>DIRECTING: Serviceable job by Jonathan Mostow, the action scenes are well structured, and the character scenes are watchable enough.  However the framing of the images doesn't compare with the stylistic touch James Cameron displayed in T2.<br/><br/>WRITING: The dialog was succinct and to the point. No groan inducing lines, but nothing I'd call witty either.<br/><br/>ACTION: A lot of people have apparently been wowed by the chase scene involving a crane driven at high speed while ripping up half the city. I'll say this for this scene, it's loud, and it certainly must've been expensive.  Again, there is absolutely no tension in this scene, and visually it is not as impressive as say the highway chase in Matrix Reloaded. I've seen plenty of chase scenes in my time, and a great many of them were better than this one. A fight scene between the two terminators towards the end of the film fares much better, mostly because (gasp!) I didn't know how it was going to end, and because the film makers wisely avoided the use of CGI stuntmen for the most part. You could really feel the weight of the metal crashing against the environment in this scene.<br/><br/>EFFECTS: Like I said before, this film has basically nothing original story, character, or action-wise, putting a great burden on the effects to offer something to keep us interested. The result is ho-hum, although I must commend the restrained use of CGI during action scenes (a practice that has cost many other movies the suspension of disbelief from their audiences).<br/><br/>So to summarize, T3 is a mildly fun action flick.  If that's all your looking for, by all means T3 will do the job.  Just don't be suckered by the under-hyping into thinking this a great film that's come to rescue the summer. As a fan of the series I liked where the story ended up, but the journey there was at times an exercise in mind numbing predictability.<br/><br/>My Rating 6/10"

","""Terminator 3"" is a worthy successor because it continues the series in exactly the same way that, say, ""Alien3"" did not.  Whereas ""A3"" basically said ""forget those earlier two movies"" and did something disastrously different, ""T3"" follows through on situations set up in the first two installations, neither contradicting anything we were told earlier, nor pulling any crucial but previously unknown info out of a hat.  (Think ""Halloween II"": ""Gee, we forgot to tell you that Laurie Strode is Michael Myers' sister.""  Never have bought that.  None of that nonsense here.)  ""T3"" sets up familiar scenes--e.g., Arnold arrives naked from the future and has to find some clothes--then plays against expectations, often humorously, to resolve them.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor is absent, but still has her own contribution to make. ""T1"" was about Sarah; ""T2"" was about Sarah and her son John; ""T3"" is about reluctant hero John.  But since the tuff-heroine aspect is so important to this series, that baton is passed to former teenager Claire Danes, who's surprisingly capable as a pi$$ed-off action chick.<br/><br/>
Arnold's Terminator--hostile in ""T1"", helpful in ""T2""--is still helpful here, if a bit chattier.  His matter-of-fact transmission of useful info, and his timely observations of human nature as he's been programmed to understand it (""Anger is more useful than despair""), make use of Arnold's gift of deadpan comedy.  And the terminatrix, the TX, played by 23-year-old Kristanna Loken, is an absolute icepick.  Combining the deadliest aspects of the earlier models' hardened skeleton AND liquid-metal body, this one adds built-in weapons systems and the ability to remote-control other machines. Loken has only two facial expressions here: a total blank, and a go-to-hell version of a Mona Lisa smirk.  Both expressions are chillingly unblinking. Brrr!<br/><br/>Ignore the whiners who are going on about how bad a movie they think this is; they're the equivalent of Comic Book Guy on ""The Simpsons"" saying, ""Worst episode EVER!""  Killer robots, nuclear peril, over-the-top vehicle chases, and a two-fisted action heroine: what more could you ask? Surprisingly downbeat ending, all but guaranteeing a ""T4.""  Bring it on."

","A few corrections to the IMDB summaries: Arnold is the T-101 model, not the T-800, and I believe John is supposed to be 25, not 18.  (He makes reference in the movie to being 13 during the time of T:2 and then also makes reference to that being more than 10 years ago.  Also, it's been 12 years between films, and it would make decently logical sense for John to be 12 years older since both films take place in the current time.  And finally, if your local theater has an online summary of the movie, chances are they state John's age as 25 - check AMC Theaters, their summary says he's 25.)<br/><br/>The film itself was excellent.  It was a perfect balance between a story driven drama and an action packed sci-fi.  Nick Stahl did a wonderful job, fully exceeding my expectations.  Schwarzenegger was as terrific as always. He somehow takes an unfeeling cybernetic organism and manages to make him loveable.  The TX is dutifully frightening and full of surprises.  The effects are stupendous!  All in all, a real treat.  It was a wonderful movie.<br/><br/>My only disappointment was the absence of the Terminator theme throughout the film (although it did play during the closing credits).<br/><br/>Also, I don't know how reliable this information is, but I've heard that Schwarzenegger has already expressed interest in returning for a third Terminator sequel (which would be excellent because the way this film ends leaves you clamoring for a fourth installment)."

She's like a mannequin - ho-hum...oh she can inflate her bust - yeeeahhh - okay.<br/><br/>2) Story is getting harder to take seriously - yes I know it's a sci-fi action flick and it don't always have to make sense but I like my films to entertain me and get my brain kicking. Too many plot holes...heck, big enough to drive that huge crane through - though it's nice to see parts of industrial downtown Los Angeles get trash to pieces with the chase sequences. So weak story, flimsy excuse of a plot.<br/><br/>3) The Terminator doesn't do anything. Ok, yes, he does a lot of mindless damage but we don't learn anything new about him. The first one you could see the terminator thinking, processing new thoughts and ideas, he's evolving in a way - learning that life is a valuable thing. In this one he pretty much fights and fights and fights. There's a scene where John Conor says something to the line of ""What, I have to re-teach you everything ?"".<br/><br/>I want to like this film - I'm a big fan of the first two but like the Aliens series, it's getting stale.

","I adored the first two Terminator movies.  I saw the first one 10 years ago, and the second one a little while later.  I was excited at first, but had a couple misgivings.  I knew from the beginning that Linda Hamilton wouldn't be in T3, and that John Connor would be played by someone else.  I should have followed my gut and not seen this.<br/><br/>Nothing is explained in this movie, like what the T-X was made of, exactly. There was, I guess, a need for a sequel, because the first two movies created a paradox.  If they really had stopped Judgment Day, they couldn't have done it.  That is, if in T2 they stopped it, there would be no terminators, no reason to send Kyle Reese through time in the first movie, no John Connor, no damaged CPU to build Skynet on--you get the idea.  If they had really stopped the future, John Connor couldn't exist and Sarah Connor would still be working as a waitress.  What I don't get is why the terminators got sent back in the first place.  Obviously, the reason they got sent back was because John Connor was there.  Since he was there, didn't that mean they failed in the first place, so sending back machines was useless?  Anyway...<br/><br/>Back to the movie.  Yes, there were some great action sequences, but all it really did was illustrate (badly) what had to happen anyway, if you just thought about it.  It's a great movie franchise, but it's built on absolute impossibilities, not just pretend A.I.<br/><br/>I'd give this movie a 4 out of 10.  IF YOU LIKED THE FIRST TWO, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!!!"
"ekim1982","7","0","1","2 July 2003"," Not bad
","This wasn't a bad movie at all...I went in with very low expectations.  I thought it was going to suck and I expected it to be garbage.  But it wasn't.  In fact I was quite surprised at how good it was.  This doesn't even come close to the caliber of Terminator 2, and there is just not enough character or plot development to make it the way T2 did.  There are't enough characters in the film and the movie seems to drown in action with a light focus on plot.<br/><br/>Despite this, the movie IS good.  The action is intense, the effects are outstanding and its an overall decent movie.  There are shocking twists and a surprise ending that will literally blow you away.  Don't pass this up if you're a terminator fan."
"Ite","8","0","2","2 July 2003"," The T800 is back
","It was great seeing the T800 back and his relationship with John Connor. ""Hasta La Vista, remember? No that was a different model."" I also liked the cameo from the doctor from the first 2 films. I like this movie for the nostalgia. I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, so i was pleasantly suprised. The new TX is hot and plays a good villian. This is a different film than the first 2 but remember that the first 2 films were also different from each other. I can't compare it to the first 2 because i was a kid when i saw them. I actually saw T2 at the theater when it first came out. Theres no way to compare the feeling i had when i saw that to this, it was a different feel. Without giving anything away i really liked the ending.<br/><br/>t3 - 8/10"

","I guess as we see Arnold's film career spiral further down, we will have to indulge him a little more. We will have to endure his publicity stunt involving him being Governor of California and we will have to see him try to go back to something that worked for him before. So, here goes Terminator 3. Sadly, the third installment is by far the weakest of the trilogy. The character and the story has been played out. Oh sure, Arnold's character is much more hero-friendly than the the first installment and even second installment. However, as I watched this standard paint by the numbers sci-fi thriller play itself out, I just felt depressed. You are seeing Arnold try to recreate a character that he was close to twenty years ago. Oh sure, it does not take great range to do so, but still. Perhaps it is naive to expect Arnold to have matured a little bit in his acting career. However, I guess we will not see that Clint Eastwood maturation. Oh well, what is next, Total Recall 2 or Eraser II? Certainly not Last Action Hero 2, Oh Lord, please NO! * out of ****."
"googleraide","2","0","1","3 July 2003"," Almost a deception
","First, let me tell you that i'm a big fan of the Terminator movie. So i had great expectation about the third installment.  What a deception !  Here's a movie that offer bad acting, a incomplete and incoherent plot and finally a lot of «deja vu» action sequence. We can only ask ourselves if this movie is not in fact a big budget pilot for a TV serie ? There's only one great thing in this movie: the ending. So,if you want to see a very good Terminator story here some suggestion:<br/><br/><ul><li>Rent (again) Terminator and Terminator 2 - Read the great comics books published by Dark Horse Comics</li></ul>"
"wastebot","2","0","1","3 July 2003"," Unfortunately, not the termination of the series
","Unless it loses lots of money, which would be a fitting termination. Fortunately I didn't have to pay to see it.  No one should.<br/><br/>2 of 10.<br/><br/>Obviously made to capitalize on the Matrix/cyber world popularity that movie companies no doubt see as an opportunity for a quick buck.  Besides computers (machines) taking over being an obvious rip off of the Matrix/Animatrix, T3 steals from the Hulk (rebuilding nano-technology) and Men in Black II (sexy woman villain).<br/><br/>You know you're in trouble when a movie starts out ranting about armageddon. When the movie has the technology transforming into the demon-faces from horror 101, it's time to find the exit.<br/><br/>Acting is tolerable, but the scenes and characters are so predictable and cliche that the acting seems the same.<br/><br/>It tries to be funny, but the only people laughing are the people laughing loud at anything, probably paid to attend early movie showings in an attempt to try to excite the audience.  If you saw the first 2, you might find some funny spots.  More than likely, you'll find the spots that are intended to be serious as funny.<br/><br/>Video FX is nothing new.  If you've seen the previous Terminator movies, you've already seen what you're going to see.<br/><br/>Soundtrack is nothing new.  If you want the same old Terminator stuff, that's what you'll get.  That and some really bad christian pop music."
"IcyNeko","1","0","1","2 July 2003"," This movie deals a blow to newbie directors...
","I'd almost say ignore the previous poster's comments. This movie was a low blow to film directors who are starting out. Not only does its storyline override the work that James Cameron created, the movie was so full of cliches and lame jokes that.. well... I want my money back.<br/><br/>Skynet's concept was totally redone. The history of the Terminator as well as John Connor's future was re-written. And my god, the last 5 minutes.... it was as if all of the cheese in Hollywood was crammed into the last 5 minutes of this movie.<br/><br/>My opinion is that they're gearing up for a LOVE movie in T4... something remeniscent of Romeo+Juliet.<br/><br/>For the love of God, don't see this movie. See something else."
"matatiouz","1","0","1","2 July 2003"," It's Not Arnolds fault
","Spoiler Terminator 3 is horrible.  The dialogue is awful.  The acting lacks motivation.  There are too many catch lines.  In the beginning, the visual metaphor with the deer and the motorcycle insulted my intelligence.  And of course Arnold's exploding chest battery, established in the beginning, is going to kill ""Terminatrix"" in the end. It's all Hollywood, and nothing else.  Its not Arnold's FAULT; just Jonathan Mostow's.  The directing leaves everything to be desired.   And can you believe it, the movie ends when the machines BEGIN their ""rise.""  Why? Cause their going to make terminator 4.  The marketing ploy is sadly obvious.  If there is a bronze lining, it would be 1 of the action scenes; mediocre."
"Keil Nirby","2","0","1","2 July 2003"," most disappointing film in the history of cinema...
","...or at least in my moviegoing history.  I absolutely love the first two terminator films, but this one is just absolute BS.  It starts off well and goes downhill from there.  Whoever gave this piece of crap good reviews must've been from the studio, probably trying to push this $170,000,000 waste of celluloid.  This film should've been, and with the right talent could've been, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of the series.  Instead it is the Rocky 5 of the series.  Jonathan Mostow should not be allowed to make films for at least 5 years or until he 1)  SEES the first two terminator films before making any other sequels and 2) Grows up.  The die-hard fans of the terminator series are better off pretending this movie doesn't exist."
"Auztrianoak","10","0","1","1 July 2003"," A fast paced action classic
","Just got back from seeing Terminator 3 and I have to say this was a fantastic movie.  The chase scenes are spectacular, the CG are awesome and the story is classic.  I am so happy to comeback with this feeling and I am sure that this will be a true summer blockbuster.  Arnold was awesome plain and simple.  He reprises the role so perfect, the one-liners , the robotic movement it was fantastic.  Danes and Stahl have great chemistry and the T-X was a nice change.  Cant wait till T-4, remember "" We will meet again"""
"Krysalis","2","0","1","2 July 2003"," A Cinematic Travesty...
","How terribly disappointing. I should have expected that, after Terminator 2, that there was no way to better the series. But I couldn't help but be optimistic, so when I heard about T3's impending release, I was ridiculously excited. <br/><br/>What a mistake. The only thing T3 has going for it is its adept special effects, but these are USELESS when the script is abysmal. Terminator 1 was a brilliant action movie, followed by Terminator 2, one of the few sequels in history to surpass its predecessor in quality. And now, eleven years later we receive a tepid, boring and laughable sequel to an action masterpiece. <br/><br/>If you valued the first two movies, avoid this one like the plague. Unless of course you prefer your movies as boring and lifeless as a neutered cow."
"baza666","10","0","1","2 July 2003"," Excellent...brilliant...fantastic
","firstly, ill say that this film gets 5/5. it is exceptional. The film oozes coolness and the almost constant action never lets the audience get bored. To those who bang on about it not being as good becuase Cameron didnt do it, i say to them that cameron is over rated. this film is the 2nd best terminator film (T1 being the best) and Terminator 2 being last (mainly cos of the boring bits in it i.e. the dessert scenes). My only critisism of the film is the significantly increased use of humour, this is out of place in a terminator film. However, the rest was good (although the script could have been better), the action was relentless (particlualy the crane scene) and the actors all did a fine job, of particular interest is the end, which is excellent. this is much better than X men 2, Hulk, Matrix reloaded, best film of 2003!!!"

","TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (2003) *** Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, Kristanna Loken, David Andrews, Mark Famiglietti, Earl Boen. He's Back! And this time the Terminator is against a highly advanced model Terminatrix T-X (Loken, who comes across as a Swiss Army knife meets Sharon Stone out of Midol) sent back from the future to kill rebel leader-in-the-making John Connor (Stahl, replacing Edward Furlong, and for my money actually resembling the adult version shown in the last sequel's preamble) and his spouse-to-be (Danes, seemingly miscast and borderline a Screaming Mimi ala Kate Capshaw in 'Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom' ), by any means necessary, prior to their attempt to stop SkyNet, the nefarious weapons defense system from beginning a nuclear war. Director Jonathan Mostow (who fills in for James Cameron, who has absolutely nothing to do with this latest chapter in the lucrative franchise) skillfully handles the jaw-dropping action sequences and high tech visuals with deft aplomb (including a hairy chase sequence that rivals 'Matrix Reloaded' ) but the logy screenplay by John D. Brancato, Michael Ferris and Tedi Sarafian) hinders the pyrotechniques on display."
