","With all due respect to Eastwood's American Sniper, the academy actually got it right with this pick for best picture. Every actor and actress in this given the space to breathe life into characters, every monologue and dialogue hits like a ton of bricks, every scene tries to get towards some fundamental truth of human nature only to have the next scene undermine that character and that purported truth. It's amazing that in the era of comic book universe movies that something like this can get made at all. An absolute must see before you die movie."

","I have to say I am shocked and how many bad reviews I have seen on this site for this movie. It seems to me that the majority of moviegoers who have chosen to review here are only capable of viewing a movie at face value.<br/><br/>This movie is clearly a satirical look at Hollywood and the constant need to remain relevant in the entertainment industry.<br/><br/>I will admit that the film does appear unnecessarily ""artsy"" in places, but some Hollywood actors love being unnecessarily artsy as they think it gives them depth.<br/><br/>That was the entire point of this film, for Hollywood to turn the camera on itself and expose all of it's own crap.<br/><br/>What I took from this film is what I have always felt about Hollywood, which is also what I love about it. Actors are inherently insecure, which is why they choose to be in an industry where there is a need for constant approval. The actors who are worth their salt risk everything to entertain...us. For that they will forever have my respect.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching and worthy of it's Best Picture Oscar."
"CalRhys","Null","437","709","1 January 2015"," True Definition Of A Masterpiece
","Whilst viewing 'Birdman', I spent the first hour of the film trying to decipher my emotions and opinions towards it, what I was watching was a weird, yet wonderful work of art. Truly though, 'Birdman' is a technical masterpiece. Michael Keaton has generally been undermined as an actor (despite a few notable roles as Batman or Beetlejuice) and has instead faced Hollywood picking more acclaimed and popular actors, 'Birdman' however might just be his ticket to an Oscar nomination, and possibly even a win, his performance is mesmerising. Alejandro González Iñárritu has created a truly spectacular character study that arguably features this year's strongest acting performances, alongside a well- executed script, booming soundtrack and a monumental achievement with cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki in which he attempts a Hitchcockian approach, reminiscent of 'Rope', and displays the story through a seemingly single and unbroken sweeping shot. This is the true definition of a masterpiece."
"andersminor22","10","475","845","5 November 2014"," The Definition of a Masterpiece
","I don't know how to start a movie review off, seeing as I've never written one. I feel my meager rating out-of-ten is enough information to tell those interested what I think of a particular movie. Birdman, however, is the exception.<br/><br/>I understand I'm an absolute stranger. Who gives a damn about what I have to think? My only hope is that after reading one fan's fanatic praise for Birdman, you will go and see it. In the interest of not over-hyping this movie (which many will feel I'm about to do), I will say it's nothing short of utterly amazing. Every aspect of the film is masterfully crafted and executed. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography only exemplifies this. The brilliant choice of always having the camera rolling lets the viewer see what happens before and after any given event. This added information creates a realism unknown to nearly every other movie ever made. What better way to capture the raw emotion and awkward stumbling of an angry outburst at your father than to show the immediate reaction of the ranter following her outburst; you get to see the anger slowly fade from her face as the reality of what she said sets in. Details like this are so often lost and these often- lost, immersive subtleties are what make Birdman the gargantuan triumph it is. Not to mention some of the transitions and dolly shots are just damn impressive.<br/><br/>Even though many movies are yet to come out this pre-Oscar season, I feel it is safe to say no other casting ensemble will come close to the performances given in Birdman. Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Stone, Ed Norton, Amy Ryan, and every single other actor in the production execute their roles with professionalism that most movies are lucky to see in just one of their actors. Each actor didn't wait for their time to shine to pull out the big guns; every moment of screen time was utilized to its full potential. There isn't a second where the audience's immersion is broken by an awkwardly delivered line or a slightly out-of-place facial expressions or emotion. <br/><br/>The only criticism I have about the film is that more aren't like it. A smart, satirical movie that is capable of criticizing without being hypocritical is unfortunately rare. However, it's rather nice to have movies like this stand out from the crowd instead of being the norm, because the relative quality only makes them that much better.<br/><br/>So, in short, I implore you. I beg you. If you step into a movie theater once this year, let it be to watch this film. It deserves your attention."
"frank_gonzalezrivas","10","153","267","2 March 2015"," Alejandro is the Real Deal
","This movie really touch my soul in very different ways, I was laughing and crying at the same time when I was watching it. Alejandro's clean smooth directing really states a new canon in the way a movie is conducted, I was blown away with Michael Keaton's perfect performance and the rest of the cast did well around him. I had never seen this kind of genre called ""Magical realism"" as well as in this movie, it really submerge you inside the head of the main character and the brilliant drum-based score helps to explain the situation by the minute. I am very happy with the Oscars won by Alejandro (well deserved) especially because I am Mexican too. I know that this kind of movie is not for everyone, some people said that it is boring, pretentious, over-the- top, strange, difficult to understand, hideous. But let me tell you this movie is fascinating, touching, funny, sad, eloquent, fantastic and dramatic. I liked very much how it makes fun of big-budget summer-blockbusters hero-movies which easily Alejandro will have done if he had wanted but no, he preferred an artistic low budget movie that make you feel instead of make you eat popcorn."
"ClaytonDavis","10","516","994","13 October 2014"," Using the ""M"" Word Again...Masterpiece!
","I think we've all been exceptionally good this year because Christmas came early with Alejandro González Iñárritu's masterful ""Birdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),"" an experience that you won't soon forget. Debuting at Venice and Telluride Film Festivals, the film closed an already impeccable New York Film Festival on Saturday morning for press and industry colleagues. It's a film that resonates profoundly, and may just be the best film of 2014. From its pristine writing (by Iñárritu, Armando Bo, Nicolas Giacobone, and Alexander Dinelaris), to its carefully constructed direction and cinematography, to its genius casting and performances, ""Birdman"" is just a dream of a movie.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of Riggan (Michael Keaton), a washed up actor who used to play a superhero icon called Birdman. In a valiant attempt to reclaim his career, he adapts, directs, and stars in a Broadway play. With problems from one of his very method actors (Edward Norton), assistant daughter (Emma Stone), emotional co-star (Naomi Watts), overly sexual girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough), flamboyant producer (Zach Galifanakis), and loving ex- wife (Amy Ryan), Riggan prepares for the breaking point of his career.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" is so damn enjoyable and one of the most entertaining films in years. It charms not just because of its story, but because of the performances and slick way that co-writer/director Iñárritu plays with tone. It's downright hilarious in parts, probably the funniest film of the year, and then there's the dramatic edge that comes into play, and simply breaks your heart. Above all, Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" is a celebration of cinema. It's an audacious achievement that floors just about every aspect of film witnessed in 2014. Iñárritu already had vocal admirers from ""Amores Perros,"" ""Babel,"" and ""Biutiful,"" but this is his most accessible. This will move him up in the ranks with the Scorsese's, Spielberg's, and Eastwood's. He familiarizes us with the stage and the theater. He makes the surroundings a very palpable character for us to know and enjoy. <br/><br/>At 63, Michael Keaton has been criminally underutilized in his career, despite some iconic performances. The nerd crowd will worship him as the ideal Bruce Wayne/Batman combo, while the same thick will remember his ""Beetle Juice"" fondly for all-time. Where Keaton was passed over was for his dramatic capabilities. I've beat the horse dead on mentioning his cancer-stricken father-to-be performance in ""My Life"" or his recovering alcoholic player in ""Clean and Sober."" In ""Birdman,"" Keaton marries the two with an undeniable sensibility that stands as the actor's finest to date. It's such a studied turn, you feel the accuracy and precision in which he executes every move and mannerism of Riggan. It's the role that Keaton has been waiting decades for. It's the role of his career.<br/><br/>If we're talking about underutilized actors, then Edward Norton needs to be mentioned. Two brilliant performances under his belt, both Oscar-nominated (""Primal Fear"" and ""American History X"") but both passed over for someone else, Norton is back and better than ever. A scene-stealing standout, Norton makes us realize how unspoken dialogue between characters can be just as humorous without the punchline. Emma Stone has finally arrived with ""Birdman."" Criminally misused and passed over by Hollywood for ""bigger name"" actresses, Stone finally shows the world what they've been missing. In one single scene, Stone revolutionizes and captures the essence of ""Birdman"" with a ferocity that you couldn't see from any other performer. She finds the heart and soul of Sam, laying her on the screen meticulously and transparent. <br/><br/>Though brief in screen time, the vivacious Naomi Watts, the sexy Andrea Riseborough, and the seasoned Amy Ryan make their marks exquisitely. Watts gets the most chuckles out of the ladies while Ryan has the greatest arc for us to explore. I hope and pray that Zach Galifianakis continues down a path in independent cinema. Fully realized and delivered, he layers the film with a beautiful sympathy, vocal and restrained, he finds the meaning of Riggan and presents him to us.<br/><br/>Emmanuel Lubezki. That is a sentence, statement, and just pure cinematic meaning nowadays. You can't watch a movie shot by the Academy Award winning Cinematographer and not find yourself more intimately contained and available to the realm of the movies. Just one year after stunning us with ""Gravity,"" Lubezki allows the audience to be in the movie. We are present in every scene, every movement, and every thought that a person is having. We feel as though Riggan and the cast are interacting with us. When they're laughing, we're laughing, when they're crying, we're crying. He is an absolute magician. <br/><br/>This seems to be the year of the drums because Antonio Sanchez composes ""Birdman"" with a drum score that lays deep in my ear canals. Tapping your feet and bobbing your head, Sanchez elevates the film to new heights. Editors Douglas Prise and Stephen Mirrione may be the unsung heroes because in the film, we are nearly in one continuous take, which hardly ever gives up (at least to the untrained eye). In no way do I call myself someone who can spot a digital edit, but I spotted no more than a dozen cuts throughout. That is amazing. I'm sure there were dozens more, but you couldn't catch them.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" is a masterpiece (there goes THAT word). At a time where movies feel like they have to choose to between comedy and tragedy, Iñárritu's beauty works on us from the inside-out. It's a human story, comedy, thriller, mystery, all rolled into one. All told by a master filmmaker and storytellers. The year's must-see experience."

That said, Michael Keaton and the cast give wonderful if sometimes overacted performances. You can see why critics like it - it's not the pap that they are forced to view day in and day out because it's their job to watch it. Professional critics, for their own sanity, grasp at any opportunity to promote something different or unusual. But just because it's good for them doesn't make it good for us, the casual movie goer.

"Turfseer","3","556","1115","23 October 2014"," ""Art"" vs. Commercial Success is the one-joke idea this overrated claptrap attempts to mine, ad infinitum
","""Birdman"" is the latest overpraised and over-hyped ""art"" film by the acclaimed director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Michael Keaton, who was known for playing Batman in the late 80s and early 90s, is cast here as Riggan Thomson, a washed-up Hollywood actor, once famous for playing a superhero Birdman character in the movies, now making a comeback on Broadway, acting in an adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story.<br/><br/>The entire film is shot as if it's one long take in a cinema verité style. Perhaps the best thing about the film is the behind-the-scenes peek at the technical aspects of a Broadway theater production. Initially, the narrative takes the form of a black comedy in which we're asked to laugh at the denizens of the theatrical world, all of whom are depicted as deeply flawed.<br/><br/>Riggan's big fault is that he's deeply ashamed of ""selling out"" years earlier when he took on his superhero role. But now, by attempting to mount a ""serious"" Broadway play, he has a chance to redeem himself. But his Birdman persona keeps appearing in the form of a disembodied voice (and later hallucinations), telling him that he will fail. The idea that there are those performers who believe that ""art"" is anathema to commercial success, is mocked incessantly throughout the film, but we get the joke early on, and eventually it becomes tiresome.<br/><br/>When the lead actor in the play is mysteriously knocked out by a falling stage light, Riggan is desperate to find a replacement, since previews are about to begin. At first the well known ""method"" actor, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), appears to be a godsend that will save the show; but soon it becomes apparent that Mike is exceptionally unstable. We're supposed to laugh at a character who gets drunk during his first rehearsal and later attempts to rape one of the female actors while they're on stage, lying on a bed, under the covers, before an audience who misinterprets the scene as comic.<br/><br/>Later, in a bar, Mike puts Riggan down further by pointing out that the napkin that was given to Riggan and signed by Raymond Carver, was given to him in a bar while he, Carver, was drunk. Mike tells Riggan that he's too untalented for Broadway and introduces him to Tabitha, the vicious Times critic, who later tells Riggan that she'll never give him a good review because anyone who sells out to Hollywood can never do anything good in the ""legitimate"" theater. The negative Times critic is just another example of the exaggerated caricatures sprinkled throughout the film, which simply aren't funny (a more realistic portrait of theater people should highlight both their positive and negative attributes!).<br/><br/>Also in the mix is Riggan's daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), who has just been released from rehab for drug abuse. Riggan receives a double dose of humiliation: first when he is locked out of the theater in his underwear and is forced to perform before the audience almost au naturel and later when he discovers the slimy Mike, has had sex with his daughter.<br/><br/>By the time we experience the ""twist"" of a ""happy ending"" at the denouement, there's nothing left for the audience to laugh at, since Mr. Iñárritu has smugly shot down all of his straw men caricatures. Riggan ""triumphs"" first when he blows off his nose with a gun loaded with live ammunition and Tabitha then gives him a favorable review, dubbing the performance an exercise in ""ultra-realism."" His new prosthetic nose appears to resemble Birdman's, and Iñárritu has Riggan fly away, now self-actualized, having had a Broadway hit.<br/><br/>The whole idea that commercial success and ""art"" is mutually exclusive is not borne out by reality. Even Riggan acknowledges that actors like Robert Downey Jr. can be successful in both worlds. So basically ""Birdman"" becomes a silly, ""one-joke"" idea, not based on reality nor worth hammering down our throats, ad infinitum."

","Great opening at the Venice Film Festival with this must-see movie. The story of an actor persecuted by the role that made him popular, ""Birdman"", and pressured by the willing of proving himself on stage with his new play.<br/><br/>The characters in the story are all struggling with something: Sam (Emma Stone) with her drug addiction, Mike (Edward Norton) with his sexual problems, Lesley (Naomi Watts) with her self- realization and Michael Keaton with love. What kind of love is he lacking? Is it admiration for his work? The same admiration that chained him to Bridman, who is probably the only one capable of saving him.<br/><br/>The cinematography reminds of that used in Hitchcock's ""Rope"": it seems to be filmed consequently. The originality of the cinematography, though, may have sacrificed the storyline.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" certainly needs to be seen more than one, but likewise certainly it's going to be one of the greatest movies of the year"

"aharmas","1","501","1014","10 December 2014"," One star and that's for Keaton's effort
","There's always a slot for a movie every calendar year for the one film that everyone praises but hardly anyone understands, likes, or comes close to fathom why it receives such accolades. ""Birdman"" and its entire cast and crew (with the exception of Keaton) have taken that spot, dislodging ""Boyhood"" out of this position. Still, ""Boyhood"" had Ethan and Arquette, which made it passable.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" feels like an inside joke, and it never escapes that categorization for it constantly repeats its wink wink attitude. It keeps calling attention to how much it knows about the world of theater and its actors, so full of insecurity, mental trauma, every possible mental instability you can think of, and most importantly inmeasurable amounts of egocentric devotion. It is always, not so subtly calling attention to how hard it is to be a real actor, how much drama there is, and how special those beings are.<br/><br/>Keaton plays an actor who wants to be taken seriously by giving Broadway a try, and it's not an easy task because for starters, he doesn't trust himself as being anything else but a long-gone matinée idol, and this is in spite of his fans who keep jumping out of nowhere. You'd think that'd keep his ego satisfied, but where would the film go if there was no drama? So the four writers behind this mess keep piling up the tragedies... an addicted daughter, a possibly cheating girlfriend, who might or not be pregnant, a loving ex-wife who can't stay away in spite of the ""attack"", a manager who seems to offer too much support, a hateful critic, the local bar... I kept wondering when the Thelma Ritter character was going to make an appearance to liven things a little, but we did have an Eve Carrington type in there, somehow modified to make it look fresh and more psychotic. I never thought I would dislike anything Norton did, but this film managed to make him and Watts totally useless, and these two have been formidable, especially Watts in her last films. She's wonderful in ""St. Vincent"", showing she's capable of delivering great performances, and to make us feel even worse, there's that lesbian kiss, making me yearn for her sublime turn in ""Mulholland Drive"".<br/><br/>So much is wrong with this film that it would take pages to express the disatisfaction. The dialogue is borderline unbearable, making us wish the fictitious ""Birdman"" strike them dead. These people can't stop talking about their ""problems"" because if they didn't have them, their lives would be even more boring. It's just plain unbelievable that all actors carry that psychological weight. Are there any happy Broadway types? Even Watts is not happy she finally made it?<br/><br/>Then there is the gratuitous nudity. There was something strange about that preview, and it did hint at both something special and something really wrong with the film. To be fair, had the film concentrated on the Keaton character, it would have soared. This happens way too late in the movie, and it's an incredible flight of the imagination, but the road there is just mined with too many pretentious and incompetent attempts at being ""original"". I haven't heard that many yawns and sighs in one theater as I did this time. It's just an utter mess.<br/><br/>The subject of the theater and acting has been explored and shown with fantastic results, classic performances, and most importantly with superb examples of insight and drama. ""All About Eve"" and ""All That Jazz might be the best of those films, and I can recall O'Toole, Finney, Weist, and a few other very talented actors and directors showing that type of life can indeed be full of drama, wit, insecurity and human comedy. ""Birdman"" only shows everything that can go wrong with trying to pretend that you do know what is going on.<br/><br/>Finally, don't get me going on those long hand-held shots... There was once a film about some criminals that was praised to heaven for something similar, and that certainly didn't make it a better film. In this case, it's supposed to be intimate; instead it's annoying, intrusive, disturbing and just another example that along with the interminable number of close ups, it only makes us feel extremely nauseous."

With that said, this is a pretentious experiment that only daft art school students and guilty ""professional"" critics can appreciate.

","Less than a week into the new year and we have a prime candidate already for the worst film of the year. Inarritu has shown that his view of creating a production for the theatre is so hackneyed it is a rival for Mel Brook's ""The Producers"" but without the laughs. Here, as the director, he is self-indulgently showing off his abilities to the audience - watch me use time-lapse photography instead of cutting to move the time of the action along; see how I have learnt how to move my actors around the set from my regular viewing of the""live"" episodes of ""Coronation Street""; aren't I clever in the way I track my camera from the outside of a building into the inside via a balustrade and a window; what about the way I position my camera within the confines of a dressing room so that you don't see it recording what's going on inside - all this trickery highlights his inability tell a story in a way that involves the audience. I was looking forward to seeing Michael Keaton show his acting chops in a role that he was born to play - washed-up TV star trying to make a comeback into celebrity and the acting game in general but flirting with madness whilst trying to do so but his ""Birdman"" alter-ego kept getting in the way at the behest of his director. But his was not the only talent that was wasted. The rest of the cast were similarly handed caricature-driven roles that they could do nothing new with - Edward Norton playing a ""prima donna""actor brought in to bolster the box- office appeal of the play and who has his own ideas on how to play his role; Naomi Watts playing an actress given her first role in a Broadway show and being crippled by nervousness to the extent that she is sick prior to the opening night performance; Andrea Riseborough as Keaton's new girlfriend possibly impregnated by him and not sure how to deal with this; Zach Galifianikis as the producer only worried about the money and the show's success; Emma Stone as Keaton's ex-drug addict daughter trying to keep Keaton and herself stable as Keaton goes off the rails - is there anything new here? I don't think so. The only reason I give this film one star is because of a short scene between Keaton as actor and Lindsay Duncan as Broadway theatre critic were she attacks him as a Hollywood invader of the ""High Art"" of Broadway and he attacks her for just being a labeller of theatrical types. This scene happens towards the end of the film and sadly comes too late to save it from its crassness. What a film it would have been if this had been the theme running through it. ""The Sweet Smell of Success"", ""Topsy-Turvy"" and even ""The Producers"" need not worry about their reputations for examining the theatre and the folk that work within and outside it. They are classics. This film is decidedly not."

","Coming in to this movie, I had heard bad things from people who had  seen it but great things from critics. After leaving, the only good  thing about it was the acting. This movie definitely was different and  unique, but there's a difference from being different and making art  and being different and making a piece of crap. The fact that this  movie was nominated for best picture above a piece of art, such as  Interstellar, is appalling. I do applaud the director for taking a risk  and trying to make an unconventional movie, but he needed to first  develop a plot in order to make a good movie. I strongly discourage  anyone from wasting their time and money seeing this. If you want to  watch a movie that is different and considered art, watch any  Christopher Nolan, Stanley Kubrick, or Quentin Tarantino movie, not  this pathetic excuse for entertainment.

Man is successful but inwardly unrewarded. He has also rejected his family in search of California movie gold. So, he wants to redeem himself and try his hand at serious theater. Throw in a disturbed and rehabbed daughter, a long-suffering but understanding wife, and a producer pulling his hair out because the 'play' isn't a success and you've got all you need to know.<br/><br/>The rest is a montage of suspected hallucinations, maybe suicides ""who knows?"" and you're left feeling empty, cheated and angry because you know somebody's trying to be nouveau and special but simply missed it completely by being too insider and artsy about the whole thing.<br/><br/>Do not waste your time. If you want to see what theater and Broadway are all about and need a laugh, watch The Producers with Zero Mostel instead. If you want deep, head scratching drama that goes nowhere, go ahead, pay up and watch this nonsense.<br/><br/>And, I might add, Michael Keaton, to me, was trying too hard, had few acting chops and it was embarrassing to watch him in this.

My friend said it was better than ""The Judge"", not even close. From start to finish, that moving is an interesting story. From start to finish, I didn't care about any of the characters in this film. It won't get wide release because it won't appeal to most people. I have a theory that it will appeal to people that like jazz. It'll win awards because it appeals to critics. Oh, a spoiler, the plot is boring. I will say the actors did a really good job.

","This movie is widely criticized here because of its supposed lack of story. Indeed, if you've got your head stuck in the a** of the superhero movies and cellphone culture that Iñarritu is vehemently complaining against with this movie, it's got a definite lack of action. But, if you can appreciate a bit more subtlety and have some patience, can tie up some of the loose ends by yourself instead of having everything spelled out for you, then you'll see this movie is a nice little puzzle. It shows an actor that is depressed, passed his high days, going insane- some of the scenes really blur the line between reality and the main character's imagination. Definitely not an easy watch, but both the story, camera-work and acting have been worked out in detail really well- however none provide the viewer with everything on a silver platter. Watch if you're in a mood to think, not if you want an easy cheesy comedy."

"trublu215","10","125","249","16 October 2014"," Sweeping cinematography mixed with brilliant performances makes Birdman one of the very best of the year.
","Birdman is a brilliant, mind blowing experience that is filled with grand performances, Hitchcock-esque camera movements and a brilliant way of storytelling. Above all, Birdman's all star cast featuring Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Zach Galifinakis propel this film to greatness, telling the story of a has been actor, Riggan, who was once known for a comic book franchise from yesteryear as he struggles to regain the stardom he once had through an off Broadway play. This proves to be harder and harder for Riggan as he deals with the disappointments of his own life while dealing with the difficulties of making this play his ticket back to stardom. This film serves as a somewhat personal film to Michael Keaton, giving the mere fact that he was known for playing Batman, a comic book hero eerily similar to Birdman. Keaton is an actor that proved time and time again that he can play virtually anything from heavy and hard hitting dramatic roles to silly and funny comedic roles as well. In Birdman, he strikes a perfect balance between the two and turns in the best performance of his entire career. He is firing on all cylinders and truly rises to perfection especially in scenes with an equally great Edward Norton. Another highlight of Birdman is the cinematography. First off, WOW. This film has some of the best cinematography I have seen in quite some time. Focusing on extremely long and spiraling takes, it submerses you in the scene, giving you the type of voyeuristic experience that Birdman calls for. We very much follow these actors as if we're watching a documentary on LSD. The camera movements are slow and bouncy, the tracking shots are nothing short of amazing and it gives an overall, dream like experience when watching this film, something that really benefits the film towards the latter half of it. I fully expect the film's Director of Photography Emmanuel Lubezki to score a Best Cinematography nomination come Oscar time. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has given us some new age classic films such as Babel, Biutiful, and 21 Grams. Birdman is no exception and, to be honest, this very well may be his masterpiece. He directs his actors with grace and never lets them miss a beat and with some extreme long takes throughout the film, it shows just how good of a director he is and just how good his actors can be, especially Michael Keaton. Overall, I could go on and on about this film and just how great it is but nothing of what I say here can really do Birdman justice. It is a film that you need to experience for yourself. With that being said, Birdman features amazing performances including a jaw dropping turn from Michael Keaton, along with some of the best cinematography I've seen in years. If there is one film to see during the Awards season, it is Birdman."
"paultreloar75","8","51","95","23 February 2015"," Johnny is a joker....
","So going to see Birdman the night after it's just won the Oscar for best movie has to be a bit of a gamble hasn't it? After all, there's nothing that Hollywood likes more than something that sucks up the juices and shows it how it really is. And we all must know already that Birdman was the reason why our hero had been famous previously and is now trying to capture something of that lost fame and glory right? Well yes, as far as it goes, that may be true. Yet despite my slight trepidation at what was to come, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised this evening and walked away feeling quite content.<br/><br/>This tale takes you centre stage to a quite wonderful turn from our slightly saggy, slightly down at heel Micheal Keaton as the eponymous hero, aka Riggan. We are given to understand from the off that the star turn may be experiencing some kind of psychotic episode, although this is never really confirmed either. Hey, after all, this is the movies isn't it? Except that it isn't, it's the thrill of the greasepaint and the creaking of the boards. And that's what scares him. Why's he doing this? It's not at all apparent that he even knows. Except that he's put everything on the line for a Raymond Carver play.<br/><br/>His ally Jake is impeccably played by Zach Galifianakis, with a quite beautiful mixture of encouragement and fear. Emma Stone does the moody daughter to a tee, sparky when required and distant for the majority. And Andrea Riseborough as the pregnant (or not) passionate partner outdoes herself in my opinion, really solid in her screen time, probably slightly overshadowing Naomi Watts into the process. As for Edward Norton, he nails it as the method man whose priapic ways on stage are in stark contrast to his troubles off. Our Lindsay Duncan does a great star turn as an embittered critic with unwieldy power.<br/><br/>If you've heard about the continuous shot style, then enjoy it, as it adds a layer to the movie, both stylistically and chronologically, that impressed me greatly. We're mainly stuck inside the twisting confines of the theatre and at times one can feel lost as to precisely where we are. Which probably isn't something that's happening by default, but rather by design. The script is excellent, many laughs to be had, and some real scenes of tenderness too, which is quite a trick to pull off I feel. The plot shifts along effortlessly, never feeling like you're watching a two-hour production. And the score is to die for, it almost felt like Whiplash Redux.<br/><br/>Worth the Oscar? Who cares, all I want to know is, did he fly?"

","After I watched this movie last month, I have had to come to IMDb every other day, sort the reviews, and read those below 5/10 in order to get this off my chest.<br/><br/>This movie is so pretentious that every time I think of it I become super uncomfortable, confusing, and mad. I cannot help noticing that the director also has Babel under his name. All the things add up then. That sxxt is also a load of broken scenes, unreasonable normal people (NOT EVEN ARTSY ACTORS)around world doing the most insane things, and self-indulgent directing. <br/><br/>I have gone through the same feelings when I watched that mess, eight years ago. Unfortunately or fortunately, I was a college kid back then so not sure what to say about such a movie that is supposed to be deep, deep and deep. Now I am a grown-up and have the gut to say: fxxk off, whoever writes or directs this sxxt (with all due respect to the actors). <br/><br/>First of all, one can easily tell the director/writer does not care about the audience. By putting those semi-scientific scenes in trailer, they were saying: ha, you stupid and shallow people, you are amused by these man-flying scenes, aren't you? When you walk into the cinema, you would finally see what this movie is really like. Cry! You are punished for liking to see some man-flying scenes. You are exactly one of the group that we mock at and that chases Hollywood stars and fancies commercial movies. <br/><br/>On the other hand, after showing a big middle finger to the sane people who pay good money to watch his shxty movie, the director/writer turns to the Academic critics with a big flattering smile, and does his best to please those similarly self-indulgent people. By throwing all the big concepts here and there without fully development, he simply did it. He successfully entertains those critics and academic reviewers who consider themselves AS SAME DIFFERENT. <br/><br/>Second, there is literally no plot. I can hardly believe anyone would synchronize with any of these CRAZY people if he/she is not crazy. I care about no body except Keaton's role, only because I wish him just to die, one way or another. <br/><br/>Third, I understand what the director/writer tries SO hard to deliver. These actors, they are tough, they are living miserable life in search for a realization of themselves and a recognition of others. However, what they actually accomplish is only making the audience miserable, but in a totally different way. I feel so miserable watching broken plots, under-developed characters, and unreasonable actions that I cannot pay less attention on how miserable the actors are. <br/><br/>Fourth, anyone who rates this movie over 6, could you tell me why is there a lesbian scene out of nowhere and going nowhere? Also while so many have praised Stone for her role, could anyone tell me what her role is and what does the writer want to say through her mouth? <br/><br/>OK, hopefully after this I can finally escape from this absolutely hyped movie."

Enough to drive the viewer to madness. I was expecting big things from this production, but it has failed in all areas that a good film should succeed in. The funniest part was certainly Edward Norton's boner! Other than that my partner and myself found it hard to keep watching without wishing it Was over.

","It's chaotic and loses focus now and again, but it is ambitious with some of the best acting you will see in any movie this year. It is witty and self aware and there are many who simply won't ""get it"". If your tastes lean more to the obvious or straight forward, this is not the movie for you. If you like imaginative, challenging, and visually stunning films that deal with ego, passion, love, weakness, insecurity and redemption, this is worth your time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately some subplots are completely forgotten and character arcs begun but not finished, but there is so much rewarding here to be found these are mostly forgiven shortcomings. The editing and scene structure plays like a stream of consciousness, but the consciousness of a very neurotic person. And while there are several standout performances in a uniformly excellent cast, Keaton is the the focus and he is amazing. He runs the gauntlet of neurosis and desperation and pulls it off with an amazing balancing act between insanity and relatability. Perhaps not the best film of the year, but a very memorable one."
"Cinnyaste","3","125","259","8 January 2015"," Look at me! My film is brilliant, the rest are crap
","While there are strokes of brilliance and humor in ""Birdman,"" the sum effect is shock at the narcissistic disdain the director holds for audiences.<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough: a huge action star (Keaton) refusing to add another franchise film to his resume attempts to break away by mounting a pretentious, overstuffed play based on Raymond Carver's writings. A coterie of malcontents and neurotics abet Keaton. Using an experimental brush loaded with mysticism, surrealism and existential angst, Iñárritu follows the on and off stage drama in one take. (Acclimating to the lack of cuts takes a few moments, but an unbroken shot does not really add to this story just as it failed in Hitchcock's ""Rope."")<br/><br/>The good is aforementioned. Unfortunately, the bad tilts the scale way over.<br/><br/>Partly meant as commentary about the nature of art and distilling culture to the lowest common denominator, the director beats a dead horse, resuscitates, and then beats it to death again.<br/><br/>Add obvious commentary about the craft of acting on stage and film and blithely stumbling upon success.<br/><br/>Ironically, those who are drawn by this big budget art film have the sophistication to realize the message already. Those who wouldn't see ""Birdman"" on a bet, the audience whose nose elitist Iñárritu tweaks, will never receive the message. Why should they? People like what they like, and if they like cotton candy let them go forth and eat. Only one with a huge ego – this director – would have the temerity to call anyone on their preferences.<br/><br/>Then add whining actors portraying every showbiz cliché while the film spools on and on and on.<br/><br/>Then add the irony of effects like those in frowned upon action tentpoles are what made the single shot possible in ""Birdman.""<br/><br/>The actors bought into this story. They give it their all and do good work, particularly Edward Norton. However, Zach Galifinakis proves he's out of his depth outside man-child roles for which he's best known. One wonders if Galifinakis was cast to prove the director's corollary.<br/><br/>Slow, boring, distasteful and insulting does not offer a pleasant experience.

I don't know what type of film the preview was trying to make ""Birdman"" seem like, but it's not anything like I thought it would be.<br/><br/>Inarritu, the editors, and the cinematographers incorporate a style of editing which would have been impressive without any plot whatsoever. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, almost to a fault. It's almost exhausting having to keep up with it all. The score by Sanchez is bare but works great for the film, and is aided by a few visual representations mixed in throughout. The cast is more than up to the challenge as well, especially Keaton and Norton who have a few scenes where they each get to flex their acting chops. The rest of the cast doesn't seem to get as much of a chance to show off, but does not make their performances any less impressive.

And I am very annoyed I wasted my precious time and money. The only redeeming feature was the acting which was basically very good but that is not enough reason to see this film. The interesting point about this film is there really isn't a 'spoiler'. Nothing could be said to reveal any plot, as there really isn't any plot.

Sounds like a 3 year old was recorded playing a drum kit throughout all the important dialog. In my opinion this film is too long. Well done Hollywood for making a trailer look like this could be a good film, great way to get people into the cinema. This is not a superhero film.

Throughout the movie, Riggan struggles with himself whether or not to continue with his play, or sellout and go back to his Birdman movies. Riggan has to fight through the many naysayers,the New York Times, critics, and even his daughter, played by Emma Stone, who say he is only doing this play to stay relevant. Through all these struggles, Riggan, played by Michael Keaton, pushes on with his play. Supporting actors include Edward Norton who plays his difficult and primadonna costar, Naomi Watts an aspiring actor, and Zach Galifianakis his best friend and agent.<br/><br/>All of the actors deliver completely on the play, giving the most impressive performances of their career. Aside from their performances, the most impressive part of the movie is the length of the cuts. The actors will go on for ten, twenty, thirty minutes, of dialogue before a scene ends. The camera maneuvers through narrow hallways, and follows the actors from scene to scene and impressively so.

","This movie is about how the American public will shell out good money to watch action packed junk and the disdain that the writer/director feels towards them. The movie plot is about a former action movie star who wants to show the world he is a real actor. But he will not get that chance. The public does not want him to move past his role as the super hero Birdman, critics do not like him because he is too Hollywood and other theater actors do not like him because he is not a real actor, an actor who only measures success ""one weekend at a time"" as Ed Norton's character states. <br/><br/>The audience is given the story very early on in the movie. I cannot even call it foreshadowing because the ending is so blatantly given away by a couple of characters. There should be no surprise to anyone watching this movie what will happen. But alas, the unsophisticated in the audience where I viewed the film were surprised. The dance sequence after the ultimate ending scene in the play in the movie pokes fun at Spiderman on Broadway, Marvel comic book movies, Michael Bay via his Transformers series, etc. That along with the earlier speeches with the critic, one feels that this movie is nothing more than a giant middle finger from the director and writer to the viewer. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton does a great acting job.

Emma Stone put in a nice performance as the troubled indulgent daughter just out rehab and Micheal Keaton did his best, but the script didn't give them much to work with.

","At one point in Birdman ""or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"", Michael Keaton as 'celebrity turned serious actor' Riggan Thomson rants at a vicious New York Times critic Tabitha (the excellent Lindsay Duncan – – ""About Time""; ""Dr Who: Waters of Mars"") about how all critics lamely fall on ""labels"" and ""comparisons"" to describe their subjects, never getting to the guts of how the art made them actually FEEL. And it made me FEEL like he was talking directly to me! So how did Birdman make me feel? What would be the snappy tag lines I would put on the poster? <br/><br/>""Astonished""; ""Deeply impressed""; ""Full of wonder""; ""Slightly irritating"" (that one probably wouldn't make the poster).<br/><br/>Birdman is definitely not a mainstream film, and it is likely to baffle and frustrate audiences almost as much as last year's almost impenetrable ""Under the Skin"". Riggan Thomson is part long-in-the-tooth actor and part superhero, at least in his fevered mind if not in reality. Surfing the C-list celebrity ocean following past glories in 'Birdman', 'Birdman 2′ and 'Birdman 3 (The Quest for Peace)', Thomson needs to prove to himself, his inner daemons and the world in general that he is a ""real actor"" by staging a play on Broadway. (In this regard, following Tim Burton's 1989 ""Batman"", this is almost art imitating life for Keaton). For this heroic effort he chooses a short play by Raymond Carver called ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" adapting it to allow himself to shine in the spotlight.<br/><br/>Thomson provides Broadway debuts for friend Lesley (Naomi Watts; ""King Kong""; ""The Impossible"") and crazy girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough; ""Oblivion""; ""Brighton Rock""), but is less than impressed with his male co-star. 'Birdman' exits the guy with an ""accident"", but unfortunately that introduces a cuckoo into the acting nest in the form of famous actor Mike (Edward Norton), who risks completely upstaging Thomson with his theatrical brilliance.<br/><br/>This introduction leads to one of the best laugh-out-loud lines of dialogue so far in 2015: ""How do you know Mike Shiner?"" asks Keaton; ""We share a vagina"" replies Watts.<br/><br/>Again with this introduction, we see art imitating life, since Norton's performance (particularly in the first reel of the film) genuinely does risk outshining Keaton, despite all of his Oscar hype. I thought after ""Whiplash"" my choice for Best Supporting Actor was fairly safe with J.K Thompson . but after seeing Norton's performance I could see the race as much closer.<br/><br/>Overall though this remains Keaton's film, and his performance is remarkable in an extremely varied and challenging role.<br/><br/>Also remarkable is the gorgeously kooky Emma Stone as his sexually-louche and druggie daughter-cum-assistant Sam. This is particularly true in one astonishingly good rant to camera, where Stone delivers what could be termed an ""Anne Hathaway Les Miserable"" moment in its Oscar-worthyness. In each film, Stone is just getting better and better. I have said it before and will say it again, Stone is a future Streep in the making.<br/><br/>As the previews of the play progress towards a dramatic opening night, Thomson's grip on reality continues to unravel, as pressures get forced on him from all sides: artistic via Shiner; financial via his managerial colleague Jake (a dramatically better Zach Galifianakis than in the ""Hangover"" series); and via parental guilt over the relationship with his daughter. His outbursts both as Thomson and (down two octaves) Birdman become more and more extreme and paranoid – ""I'm a f****** trivial pursuit question"" he rants at one point while destroying his dressing room in rock group style.<br/><br/>The startlingly daring drum soundtrack by Antonio Sanchez actually counterpoints the action extremely well. Breaking down the fourth wall, the drummer keeps randomly appearing in a most surprising manner.<br/><br/>So what of the ""Slightly irritating"" poster quote? Director Alejandro González Iñárritu undoubtedly delivers a tour de force of a film; an instant classic that will be poured over by film students for years to come. However, he delivers the whole film in the style of one continuous take (give or take the odd time lapse sequence). And whilst this was entertaining to start with, I personally started to find it tiresome and irritating by the end of the film. Like Hitchcock's ""Rope"", also filmed in this way, you are constantly distracted by looking for where the edits actually fall, sometimes seeing what looks to be an inconsistent couple of frames where perhaps no cut existed in the first place! Worthy of note though was Emmanuel Lubezki (""Gravity"") who's cinematography also bore many similarities to Hitchcock classic effects, including long drifting panning shots that appear to seamlessly melt through metal railings etc. Very impressive.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a must see for lovers of the art of filmmaking, and Birdman should feature very strongly at the Oscars in a month's time.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review please see past reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email on the site to receive future posts.

","There are very few times when I can actually say a movie has completely surpassed my expectations. It is sad but commercial cinema rarely takes chances anymore and art films are now usually more into the experimental and shock factor than actually trying to innovate a way to tell a story. Birdman does all of this and more. <br/><br/>I have to confess I had lost faith in Iñarritu and I usually find his movies hard to watch, they are dark and quite depressing and leave me with a sense of despair. Im not saying this is bad just that it makes his movies too dense for my taste. <br/><br/>That is why Birdman was such a surprise: Iñarritu has completely reinvented himself and the kind of stories he usually tells, in turn giving us a trip into the creation of an artist and the struggle with exposing such creation to the world. <br/><br/>The acting is superb an intimate, created by his almost perfect planning of each scene. <br/><br/>On the other side, Lubezki... Chivo always surprises me with his cinematography and each movie made by his hand is like rediscovering cinema. Every shot is beautifully shot and planned, sometimes to the point where you are left wondering how he can possibly do it. He is a genius and I feel privileged to be able to enter his mind if even for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>All in all Birdman is astounding to watch and a movie that MUST be seen in cinema if only to appreciate the art of its film-making even more. <br/><br/>If you think all this talk about art and technique makes Birdman a bore to watch you would be wrong. The movie is fun and witty and heart-wrenching and special. Frankly the best I have seen in years."

From his daughter a drug addict with a chip on her shoulder to Ed Norton stripping and showing us his Auschwitz like body. Ug, an image I wish I could get out of my head.

"mjedi7","1","66","139","5 February 2015"," Excellent actors, good performance, great directing, boring movie.
","I never write reviews, but this movie deserves it, I usually have a lot of patience, I even enjoyed movie musicals. I like unusual, artsy, complicated films, but didn't enjoyed this one.<br/><br/>I have watched some trailers of the movie, already knew the plot, and at first wasn't interested in watch it, but after seen an IMDb score of 8.3 and 8.8 in Metascore, and a few reviews online, I was convinced that this was a good movie. As always the trailers show you the bests parts and the best specials effects of the movie.<br/><br/>My parents wanted to go and see it, because they thought this is a movie about a superhero.<br/><br/>The first thing that grab my attention was Alejandro González Iñárritu long takes, it make me wonder how they did some of them, some of the are pretty obvious where they cut the scene (like when they open or close doors). Sometimes this longs shots distract me from the dialog or plot (if there's one). But great work on the editing department.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton (Riggan) performance is the best thing of this movie, all the other big name actors (Stone, Galifianakis, E. Norton, N. Watts) perform as expected; excellent, but somehow I feel like they were wasted here. The great performance of Emma Stone is in a scene where she transforms and capture the audience, exploding and letting out the feelings for his father, it's the only moment in the movie where I care for Riggan, also it's the scene that was pinned in my head after watching the movie, I like that kind of movies that even after days of seen it, You keep thinking about the dialog, morals, theories, history, relations or even the special effects, this movie was just this scene with Emma. At some point of the movie i felt like Norton was competing with Keaton in who is a better actor.<br/><br/>The timing of the actors in the shots it's impressive, and I just imagine the effort to do the long shots without any mistakes. Subplots are presented to the viewer, but since this is a movie about Riggan, they are forgotten easily.<br/><br/>I didn't like the Jazzy bar music, make felt like I was in one of those hipster bars, like they were rehearsing, I like Jazz music, but it didn't help me get into the scenes.<br/><br/>Somehow I feel like this movie was made to please the Professional Critic Reviewers and actors, than the normal/common people. Also why the heck is listed as comedy in this site, a satire, but not comedy. I was expecting a twist turn or something to happen, that moment came almost at the end of the movie, an it was almost disappointing, I like the Ending though, but after the credits roll-out, I wanted to hit myself for watching this 2 hr. ""film"" (replace ""film"" with any bad word it came to your head right now).<br/><br/>I rated 3, because I liked Iñárritu distracting long shots, good acting and nice Birdman FXs (best part of the movie).<br/><br/>Definitively this movie is different and unique, thanks to Iñárritu, but it's painfully long and boring.<br/><br/>Go watch it if you're a movie critic, an actor or want to waste 2 hrs. of your life."

"richardcharlesbell","1","68","145","6 February 2015"," Probably the worst of the recent ""best.""
","Curious isn't it? Lots of people say they love it but I have no idea why. Michael Keaton was, apparently, a box office superhero star. He seeks to authenticate his life by making a Broadway hit on stage. It seems that what he had before was somehow lacking and caused him to fail both his wife and daughter. A part of him, characterized by a voice from within, keeps wanting to lure him back to fame and fortune. Another part of him, (rather less clearly cast), suggests that he is genuinely possessed of super powers, (telekinesis and the ability to fly at the very least). The film itself, partly driven by the Broadway play which both advances and reflects its themes, staggers between massive issues about love of family, artistic integrity and, crucially, being true to yourself, without examining any of them adequately. All the characters are little more than sketches and, given that this is precisely what Keaton is seeking to redress, the result is disappointing. If this film was really an artistically dressed up version of the idea that the abandonment of family and clutching at fantasy amounts to being washed up, it succeeds in stating the obvious. If it's about the difficulty to be found in recovering from such losses by regaining the love of those who matter (including love of self) it simply fails to gel. None of the characters is sufficiently developed for the viewer to be able to say very much about them or what it is that they might find lovable. There's a wife, there's a daughter, there's a movie critic, there are some fellow actors and there are some incidentals including Keaton's ""best"" friend. I watched the film in silence and felt a cloud descending. It didn't lift and I had no idea who anyone was. That can't have been the aim.....can it?"

","I won't add a blow-by-blow criticism of this film, as plenty of other reviewers have already provided those. My overall impression was summed up by one scene, where Michael Keaton's character goes to buy booze and we hear someone yelling lines from Macbeth's most famous soliloquy (""To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow ... full of sound and fury, signifying nothing""). Like that moment, _Birdman_ consists largely of hyperdramatic dialogue, delivered caustically, and without an obviously redeeming purpose.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean I'm blaming the actors; I think they work at a high level in fulfilling the director's vision. Unfortunately, that vision is almost relentlessly tawdry, depressing, and lacking in basic human warmth or decency.<br/><br/>This is probably some sort of paean to the nihilism of the acting world. Not being inside that world, all I saw and heard was an ugly, noisy mess, full of obscenities, lies, and bad behavior. It may be wonderfully self-referential if you're an actor or director or producer, but in my world, it just isn't entertaining."

","Alejandro González Iñárritu's Oscar nominated film Birdman, aka The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, is a departure from the contemporary style of filmmaking. Iñárritu uses a technique that gives an illusion as if the entire film were shot in a single extended take. Birdman's strong albeit bizarre dialogue and impeccable slapstick timing on one hand hark back to the works of the American screenwriter and playwright David Mamet, particularly Glengarry Glen Ross, while on the other, it strongly reminds of the films like Barton Fink and The Player in that it deglamorizes Hollywood while exposing its hypocrisies.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of a washed up Hollywood actor—once famous for playing an iconic superhero called ""Birdman""—as he battles both his inner demons and outer enemies in a desperate attempt to reinvent himself as a Broadway director by staging a new adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story called ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"".<br/><br/>Birdman offers a nice blend of realism, surrealism and magic realism. Vintage Iñárritu, Birdman doesn't feed any definitive answers but rather allows the viewers to engage at their own intellectual planes. While the entire cast puts up a brilliant show, Michael Keaton and Edward Norton deserve special mention for their sublime performances. For Norton, Birdman marks a return to form. As to Keaton, he delivers a performance so emphatic and complete that it can be easily described as the performance of the decade. One wonders what kept him from unleashing himself on the celluloid all these years. A must watch!<br/><br/>For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog ""A Potpourri of Vestiges""."

The increasingly annoying never-ending drum-soundtrack, the lack of any meaningful plot and confusing story, the chalkboard-ish inner voice dialogue of the protagonist, and the just plain bad, nauseatingly egocentric people cry-complaining about their ego-""problems"" that I couldn't care less about. <br/><br/>About two-thirds into the movie, it had become so excruciatingly painful to watch that I was simply forced to leave the cinema, something I've never done before, or ever thought I'd have to - never before has the cold fresh winter air felt so good to breathe, like I had just managed to break free from captivity under mentally torturous conditions. I'd wish I was exaggerating here, but I'm not.<br/><br/>The main reason I considered watching this movie was the universal critical appraisal and awards it had won, which I'll never give due weight again. Only the somewhat original cinematography prevents me from giving it a rock bottom 1."

","I feel like I've wasted 2 hours of my life. This movie had nothing to tell, it was just a piece of crap. No inner meaning, no good plot just nothing! Despite the good actors, the movie was flat and empty, it had absolutely nothing to tell. It didn't leave me any thoughts or feelings just a question to myself ""what did I just watch?!"". Watching this movie I was waiting for something to happen, something to give me a reason to spend those hours watching it, but it was a total disappointment. This movie is just a pretentious, wannabe artistic movie that is just laaame. One thing it was not, it certainly was not art. I highly recommend to not watch this s***."

","I've been using IMDb for years, but haven't felt compelled to review until now. Birdman. We all know one in real life I think....this movie is nothing like real life...or is it? That's what makes it special, and it doesn't hurt to have an all star cast, but as we've learned these days...having an all star cast doesn't always a great film make. I love the movies, and the reason I come to IMDb is for the ratings, because I know they can't just fake thousands of reviews (I hope!?). It's gotta be 7.0 or up, or no thanks. This movie earned it, and awards will follow I'm sure....and with any luck, maybe another sprouting artist will be inspired by this movie. Like me for instance, I'm no actor, but this film makes me want to fly (and not in the RedBull way). ;) Go see this film, and just soak it in.

"k-bartholomew","1","53","112","12 January 2015"," Not half as good as it wants to be
","After reading all the great reviews, I was really looking forward to seeing Birdman but I was sorely disappointed. The story doesn't develop into anything particularly interesting and I didn't care what happened to any of the vacuous, one-dimensional characters. The lesbian scene is thrown in there for no reason at all, Norton's character doesn't develop enough and we never really find out the background of the relationship between Keaton's character and his wife and daughter (I can't remember any of the character's names, that's how much I cared about them).<br/><br/>As far as I can see, the reason for the rave reviews must be down to the unique filming technique with all the long takes which is different to anything I've seen before, (even though there is more than one occasion where somebody fluffs their lines but it was left in the final cut anyway), and the acting which, to be fair, is very good. All in all, Birdman left me feeling empty. It's self- indulgent, pretentious nonsense that doesn't deserve the 5 star reviews it's been getting. Not by a long shot."

The theme of the movie being unclear at first, it had me at the edge of my seat wondering what this film had in store for me. As the movie progressed, I was in awe at the cinematic technique. The acting performances from Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, as well as Emma Stone were all incredible. Each character had a monologue that resonated within me long after the film was over. Each of them being incredibly powerful and truly makes you question our society. Each character had diversity and truly added to the theme of the film. As the credits rolled, I was bound to my seat.

"therocksbarneyreviews","10","29","57","8 January 2015"," ""Birdman (Or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" asks brilliant questions, teaches fantastic lessons and brings a new style of cinema to the fore.
","""Birdman (Or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" is a simply excellent film. Why? There is a scene in ""Birdman"" where Riggan Thompson (played by Michael Keaton), who is trying to direct and star in his Broadway adaptation of the Raymond Carver play ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"", walks towards the front of the stage and talks about love, what it is to be loved, and how we all crave that. But is it love we crave? Or, as Sam (played by Emma Stone) puts it, is Riggan confusing love with admiration? These are some of the many wide-ranging questions that ""Birdman"" leaves you with as you leave the cinema and you thus don't really realise how good the cast, direction, dialogue and score are until you've given up on those questions, realising that they are just too difficult to answer. <br/><br/>The cast is simply stellar in ""Birdman"", brilliantly led by Michael Keaton in what Variety's Peter Debruge calls the ""comeback of the century"" and which I agree with him over. However, I'm not sure if Michael Keaton would accept this title, in a recent interview promoting the film he laughed at the concept, yet the comparisons between his career and that of Riggans are unavoidable, he also laughed when this was bought up too. But, to be fair, all I knew of Michael Keaton before I saw ""Birdman"" was that he had starred in the 1989 ""Batman"" film as well as in its 1992 sequel ""Batman Returns"". His career hasn't been stellar and it's a surprise I even knew his name before I saw ""Birdman"" really But his performance in this film deserves all the attention he gets and all the awards he is being nominated for. Riggan is a complex character and you are never quite sure about him, how he feeling and how he feels towards others, not only because of how Riggan changes as the film goes on but also because of how that reflects the ever-changing nature of the film, moving from one question or theme to the other without actually leaving it behind, instead leaving it in the back of your mind for you to think about later. <br/><br/>Again, as I said earlier, the rest of the cast is great too. Edward Norton is brilliant (playing the self-obsessed, ego-driven actor who feels more real on the stage than off it, Mike Shiner). But then Miles is so much more than that and again it's hard to put your finger on what or who he is and what he is looking for. Zach Galifanakis (playing Riggan's agent, Jake) who is trying to keep Riggan grounded, is also brilliant and then so is Emma Stone and Naomi Watts (although both seem to be in very familiar roles). I could go on listing actors and actresses but it would just be a paragraph of names. (Last one I promise but Amy Ryan also does well playing Riggan's ex-wife Slyvia.) <br/><br/>But each of these is alleviated, and should thanking him in any of their Oscars speeches, by the film's director, Alejandro González Iñárritu. Alejandro hasn't done many English-Language films before (except Babel in 2006 and 21 Grams in 2003), and considering that, it makes his direction in ""Birdman"" even more outstanding. Where he really excels is in how ""Birdman"" is seemingly filmed in one take. These really emphasise how good the acting is in this film, be it a monologue by Emma Stone as she rants at her dad, a take that involves Michael Keaton walking in just his underpants through Times Square, or a scene where Keaton and Edward Norton rehearse on stage. What makes these one takes even better is how the film is almost entirely set in St. James Theatre and you really get a feel for it as you glide around it in these one takes, feeling, seeing and hearing everything that is going on. It truly is an experience. I loved every moment of it and what this ultimately did for me was make me feel like I was part of the production, as if I was being given this behind the scenes look at what was going on. This thrill inspired me to get back into acting, something that I used to do a lot of. What happens with this you as the film goes on, you begin to realise that this is less of a trip to the cinema and more of a trip to the theatre. It's a good mix of both and I can't really imagine it being the same on DVD, although it never is. I will definitely be seeing it again.<br/><br/>Birdman's dialogue is great too and it matches the fast-paced score of ""Birdman"". Both reflect how unique ""Birdman"" is and that is where its brilliance lies. Just like how when you are in a production and the curtains come down on closing night you come to think that you really did not want that to end, and I had the same feeling when ""Birdman"" did. Its cast, score and direction are all what will be directly nominated come the Oscars, but there is no specific award for the questions ""Birdman"" made me think about, the way ""Birdman"" made me feel and the lessons ""Birdman"" taught me."

","Cinematography was interesting. The long uncut scenes were impressive, and probably what held the film together, but the story needed a lot of work. The trailer was misleading and simply was not what I was expecting. I wouldn't waste my time on it if I were you. But this is all opinioncheck it out yourself if you so dare. Basically its a story about a depressed ex movie star gone theatre who's desperately trying to do something with his life but is held back by some serious psychological issues. His daughter has daddy issues and his ex wife is somewhere in-between wanting him back and hating him. You can literally sit around for a couple hours waiting for this thing to take offand by the end of the moviewell, I won't spoil that part (hint: it never takes off)."

","So, it was my 78th birthday, my son had come up for the occasion, and suggested we see a movie, specifically, ""Birdman"". In my youth I had a deep passion for comic books. Like the cars of the 40's and 50's, the comic book characters were individual, idiosynchratic and highly enjoyable...so what went wrong with ""Birdman""? Everything!.<br/><br/>A talented writer creates recognizable characters, people for whom we feel sympathy or empathy. In this film, if you close your eyes, you can't tell who's speaking, and like Rhett Butler, frankly you don't give a damn.The writers seemed to believe that constant, mindless profanity would create viewer interest. Instead,all that puerile use of copulative, sodomistic language numbs the brain.<br/><br/>I had a dental appointment the next day, and the dentist asked what I thought of the movie. My reply...""I think i just wasted two plus hours of my life."" And at my age it's a helluva loss.

The plot wandered, the characters were self-absorbed and unlikable, the music and cinematography were laughably pretentious. <br/><br/>But the WORST part about the movie was that it glorified and romanticized suicide over and over and over again. It showed suicide as not only a solution to life's problems, but a triumph over one's critics and an act worthy of a standing ovation, an act worthy of a daughters admiration, an act that makes one soar with ultimate freedom and self-worth.

","A product of a schizophrenic, decaying mind with short sequences of excellent acting... Well, this was all what I had to say but according to the IMDb rules, now I will have to write 10+ lanes, so here it goes. I was sorry for the great actors who had to participate in this ""artistic"" craziness. All characters are just wondering around along with the camera during the movie, seemingly not knowing at all what they should do or say. So most of the time they just say something randomly and act according to that. I was really surprised that it got so good reviews. Nevertheless, short sequences are played great e.g. Emma Stone with Edward Norton on the balcony. That short sequence alone made me learn Emma Stone's name - she is truly fantastic. Well I hope it is already 10 lanes. Why do I have to write 10 lanes minimum anyway? That is as crazy as this movie."

No such luck — what you see in the first five excruciating minutes is what you get. It's like that moment in an old 70s' porno film when you realize that that pimply derrière is what you are going to be staring at for the next two hours. I actually think this is worth seeing just to prove to yourself how worthless critical reviews (and reviewers) are, and what an absolute joke the Academy Awards are. If a film has a gamy whiff of artistic pretension, these self-appointed arbiters of cinematic taste are terrified of panning it. In actual fact, they have no idea if it's art or total crap, but they don't want to appear ignorant. Well folks, rest assured, this one if total crap. As other reviewers have pointed out here, in addition to everything else, the film is a colossal waste of some very talented actors, Michael Keaton not the least of them.

Oh, well, maybe Lubezki's efforts to please his egotistic boss: I can only imagine how much he had to sweat to finish each long take for the glory of Inarritu without major mistakes. But that's really all. Because direction is crap (a good concept is not a good direction). Writing is crap: Really? four writers are needed to brew this inane concoction?... YOU MUST BE KIDDIN' ME!!! Rest of acting is crap, because characters are awfully written (sorry, Norton, you're also only second best to Best Egomaniac in the movie: first prize goes to Inarritu, of course).<br/><br/>...And, last, not least... Where's Raymond Carver in all this??... Pure pose. Pure affectation. Pure mannerism. I looked carefully for Carver somewhere hidden in between the embarrassing scenes of the ""What do we talk when we talk about love"" play supposedly created from his book... Couldn't spot him anywhere near. There was nothing of Carver in any of those puerile, amateurish, flat-character ridden snippets of the play the writers gave us lucky mortal viewers. Nothing of Carver's redemptive moments. Nothing of his sad poetry. Nothing of the first rank literature that cause shivers in the reader. Nothing of the true Art that, if only for a second, offers a glimpse of sense and transcendence in this nonsense life.<br/><br/>Not to talk about the blatant and shallow references to Fellini's masterpiece ""8 1/2""...<br/><br/>Please... It's only me???..."

","Despite the fact this movie has won an Oscar, I can't think of anything else that was good about the movie. An absolute disappointment."
"diegotime","10","4","5","27 May 2019"," A perfect example of a perfect movie
","Before I get into the real meat of the movie, let me just say that the long takes in this film are crazy to think about, and even crazier and cooler to see how they edited to look like one long continuous take the whole 2 hours. Also the score is different but great, being strictly drums, creating a good setting and a Constance feeling of a fast paced, industry atmosphere. This especially works in the more tense/meaningful scenes.<br/><br/>Now that we've soaked all that in, let's talk about the actual movie part. First off, I understand that this movie, just like all others, don't always work for people, but let me tell you whether you've felt what these characters have or gone through what they have or not, this movie has great meaningful storytelling and commentary, whether it's something that could apply to you or not.<br/><br/>The actors are great, Michael Keaton went all out in this, Emma Stone is perfect playing Sam, and Edward Norton plays a very rude crude person you can eventually sympathize for. The following will enter SPOILER territory, me analyzing the story of the movie, so if you haven't seen this and are looking to, stop reading. **(But scroll down to the last paragraph if you want a verdict).<br/><br/>Michael Keaton plays the father of Sam, her being in the best attitudes or situations as a young adult, but having these happenings from her absent father (Keaton), a washed up super hero actor who doesn't realize this, trying to find relevancy and meaning in his own life, leading him to wright a play adaptation on a book. Throughout the movie Keaton and Stone have their struggles, Keaton not realizing how absent he's been in her life and a bit of the movie.<br/><br/>Not only is his struggle of finding relevancy in the industry and his own life, but this adds to relevancy in his family which he realizes wasn't as great as it should've been. His divorcée and daughter eventually reconcile with him in the end. But all this brings a great sense to they're humanity and how likable they are, which really puts even more blood coursing though the movie's veins and big heart.<br/><br/>I also talked about Riggan(Keaton)'s struggle with relevancy is the industry, and basically his life, earlier. This comes from him being a washed up actor of the once famous ""Birdman"". After abandoning a fourth movie in the series, and ultimately abandoning his character, he eventually loses a sense of what he should do, or having a purpose, which leads him to adapt this book into a play. He struggles with a bad preview with his co-lead in the play, who in the beginning is a real ""rear end""(to get this review allowed), Mike(Norton). But even he struggles with himself, which we later find out, because he is unable to be himself except in the stage, once displayed through, get this, his ""thing"" limp everywhere except on the stage. This can be very meaningful to people(not the ""thing"" thing exactly) who feel out of place.<br/><br/>Back to Riggan, he struggles in the industry and not many people seem to be picking up his new play, releasing soon. This makes him contemplate himself, and even argue with the voice in his head, which is the character Birdman, spitting out the hard truth but also over complicating things. Keaton also shows signs of possible powers when he tosses things around with his mind, but this ultimately could be in his head. Since there is a whole scene of him flying around the city but then later shows a taxi driver chasing him to be paid. But the ending, which is the one thing I WON'T spoil, can leave this to interpretation. This may also be a comment on his trying to find relevancy, whether he does or not, or maybe also him being free and himself. He even has a great and truthful argument with a critic who is ready to give Riggan's play a bad review without even seeing it, which he then has a rant about how insensitive she (and kinda all critics) are and how pretentious they can be.<br/><br/>So there, I've spent more time and put more effort into this review than I would in a school essay. But it's only because this movie is truly a masterpiece, and what all films should strive to be. Something meaningful, heartfelt, and an experience that I will never forget. Birdman is definitely my favorite superhero. This is an example of how film truly is art. I have no problem with this movie, and if you're anything like me, I don't think you will either. 10/10"

","Washed up Hollywood star Riggan wants to prove he is a ""real"" actor by directing and starring in a Broadway play. But perhaps he cannot, because he is mental.<br/><br/>Wrapped around the claustrophobic world of actors, the movie is an exercise in navel-gazing and smugness. I guess it must be a big deal for a Hollywood superstar to prove to his peers that he is not just a money-making machine but also a talented actor. However, I truly do not care about the hysterics and anguish of Hollywood actors. That is why, when Birdman was acclaimed by the critics I already suspected yet another inflated balloon full of nothing. I waited until I could watch the movie for free, because I was very reluctant to waste money on yet another ""Academy-worth"" piece of crap and I am very happy I saved my hard-earned money.<br/><br/>The joke is twice on the audience, because the other theme explored by Birdman, besides narcissist actors, is audience stupidity. Not being the sort of person who cares about superheroes movies, I was nevertheless annoyed by the fact that the public of said movies is vilified by this piece of elitist crap.<br/><br/>It is difficult to point out what I disliked most about Birdman, since I hated everything: the overbearing drum soundtrack, characters shouting their lines, the smugness of the whole concept, the patronizing dialogs, etc I do not even think Keaton was so great in it.<br/><br/>Finally, it is depressing to notice that the number of movies I want to walk out from is increasing exponentially. After decades of watching movies, what I expect is an interesting story told in an engaging way, but what I find is more and more egotistic directors busy only with producing crap bearing their trademark signature, being it Tim Burton Goth-chic or Wes Anderson smug-naive."
"mailes22","1","38","79","8 February 2015"," Worst. Movie. Ever.
","OK, I enjoy my fair share of art-house, foreign language and alternative movies, but this was just bad on every possible level. Even worse than SpongeBob SquarePants the original movie, which I suffered through with my pre-school children many years ago and which I thought could never be beaten for the title of Worst Movie Ever. Birdman with Michael Keaton goes way below the all-time low set by SpongeBob with a substantial margin. And to add insult to injury, it was twice the length of SpongeBob, so I'm calling it as twice as bad because I had to suffer twice as long. I am staggered to see that it's still holding a rating of 8.2 on IMDb, even though the 1 and 2 star reviews seem to outnumber the 9s and 10s. I had to laugh at the review that said that Birdman ""calls out unsophisticated audiences"". That review simply calls out pretentious snobbery. I would have given the movie a zero if the IMDb had let me, but Emma Stone put in a pretty good performance and probably justified the one star on behalf of everyone else associated with the movie. Self indulgent script. Badly written and poorly acted. It's not funny. It's not satirical. It doesn't offer any insights into anything. It's just bad. The group that I went to see this with started laughing as the credits rolled and we kept laughing for the next 10 minutes as we left the theatre. We couldn't believe that we'd just sat through 2 hours of purely self-indulgent cr@p, and the joke was well and truly on all of us."

What this movie TRIED to do, Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"" actually accomplished in presenting us with a story about an aging person who is trying to reinvent himself in their chosen career. Think a tired actor (Keaton) who is bitter over his career as an actor (or lack there of), and his bitterness over the sequel he never made, Birdman 4 (Batman 3). Such talented people in this film, and the acting is great, its just that the story that lacks. Is he REALLY a superhero? Is he nuts? I kept waiting for something to happen, anything to happen. To sum up, Ugh I want my two hours back!"

","I didn't want to watch the film after reading many reviews. I don't like films about the industry because they usually contain inside jokes and information more suitable for members of the industry. I did a modicum of acting as a professional in a different lifetime and understand the industry's need to massage its own ego. Birdman won the Oscar. I had to watch the film. I really wish I hadn't watched. <br/><br/>The acting was terrific. I love good work by actors, and I love Keaton. The two stars are for acting. The entire cast was great. <br/><br/>The script and the film itself didn't thrill me. Have you ever visited someone who just returned from a trip to some exotic location? Did they ask you to watch their ""home movies""? Did you sit for an eternity listening to their bubbling stories of this, that, the other thing that made the trip so exciting for them while the film rolled on and on? Did you wish the projector would just blow up and end their talking and the visual images on the screen? If you visited the same area, the film might have meaning and you might enjoy seeing some of the old places you've been, and you may have even enjoyed the meaningless commentary. At the end of the home movies, the well meaning presenter usually sits back, totally self absorbed in the greatness of their journey wondering why your eyes are glazed over and a little drool is forming on your lip. <br/><br/>Birdman was someone's home movie. The script provided me with little in the way of empathy with any character and even less catharsis, yet Hollywood loved it without realizing it was a slap to their collective faces. It treated the movie going audience badly as well. Where was the reward?<br/><br/>There was no reward."

","Birdman is a powerhouse of cinema. Throwing away the commentary on critics and the movie industry and artistic integrity; it's still a live, thriving beast that has so much unpredictability in every scene. It has raw, powerful, career-defining performances, ridiculously impressive camera-work, surrealistic cinematography and an always involving story that gives the film ground even with it's surrealistic moments (something the Tree of Life lacked a bit). You can just feel the energy, the tension, and the off-beat score drum score is impeccable. Anyway that's all I have to say about Birdman. It's my 2nd favourite film of all time (after Synecdoche, New York) and the only problem with this film is that it's too big, too alive to watch on a normal television screen.

Is it just me .or are many reviewers reluctant to state the obvious? Michael Keaton as a down on his luck Ex-Superhero, desperately trying to prove his relevance in 2015, to the entire world, to his rather distant family, but, probably most of all, to himself. Oh yeah, and he talks to himself in a rather smooth, but hoarse and gravelly BATMANI mean BIRDMAN, Superhero voice, his last on screen portrayal of which was in 1992! (Yes, in BOTH of them) <br/><br/>So, just where do we draw the line as to what is fact and what is fiction? That is one of many recurring themes dealt with in BIRDMAN. I think it is the central one in the film.Just where and when do we draw those critical dividing lines? Riggan Thompson is feeling the rapidly escalating pressure of a quickly approaching Broadway opening. It is a dilemma of his own device. His life is in shambles. He finds himself still pining for his ex, while attempting, rather ineptly and intermittently, to bond with his daughter. He has taken on overpowering debt to finance his Broadway play that, if successful, will provide him with the self-vindication he needs to put his life and career back on track. His problems seem insurmountable, or at least, he has convinced himself that they are!<br/><br/>The ensemble cast performance is deliciously superb. Zach Galifianakis as the steadfastly single-minded lawyer/best friend, who has to employ his myriad of abilities to hold the production together and keep it moving forward. Emma Stone, as Sam, the more often than not neglected as a child daughter, just out of Rehab, who seems to be on the road to stability in her life by serving as the reluctant gofer for her neophyte Broadway director/producer father. Naomi Watts, as Lesley, one of the play's stars, perhaps the star struck little girl trapped in the 30 something body of a struggling actor who is on the verge of her lifelong Broadway wish- fulfillment debut! <br/><br/>Edward Norton delivers an Oscar-caliber performance as the obsessed Method actor who's only real moments are the ones he spends on stage. And of course, Michael Keaton, in the title role, projecting a gigantic on screen presence as a man possessed, obsessed, intensely flawed, human and, ultimately, somewhat skewed by his own inner demons! Makes you wonder Exactly where does Michael Keaton end and Riggan Thompson begin? <br/><br/>I would be derelict in my reviewer duties were I not to mention the effective and original use of the continuous, one-take technique employed in making BIRDMANIt lends an extreme presence, intensity and intimacy to the overall quality and tone of the film which is quite unique. I'm sure the implementation of this style presented director Alejandro González Iñárritu with a formidable series of challenges, which he dealt with flawlessly. Gonzalez has directed some previously highly recognized films, such as Amorres Perros, 21 Grams, Babel and Biutiful. This highly thought provoking film guarantees that we will be seeing more of his work in the future.<br/><br/>10 Stars...

There's a quick flash of a beach with jellyfish, a meteor plummeting to Earth, then there's Michael Keaton; floating in mid-air Indian style. After these first few minutes of Alejandro G. Inarritu's ""Birdman"" went by, so many thoughts flew through my brain that I started to smile trying to figure things out. Without doing much, ""Birdman"" gives you a lot to think about just in the first couple of minutes. What does this mean? Why did this happen? How bizarre, how strange, how weird, how curious, how unbelievably intriguing? After Keaton leaves his dressing room, the camera follows him, and doesn't stop. It moves to other people, follows their lives, their thoughts, then comes back. I cannot get over how innovative and intriguing this film is. Along with this brilliant camera-work, the film has a fantastic script; sharp, funny, and even satirical. I smiled the whole time while watching this film.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" is the story of a man who used to play an iconic superhero in the movies, who's now haunted by these memories in his own mind, who tries to make it on Broadway. The movie is a trip through the lives of our main character, Riggan (the guy who played Birdman) and the others surrounding him. It reminded me of a Tarantino movie in a way, because of the level of ambition in the script, and the long, but masterful, meaningful scenes.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" is the best film of the year.

","At this time, ""Birdman"" has a phenomenal IMDb score of 8.7 and has been talked about a lot in regards to the Oscars. Whether the film does get the nominations (particularly for Michael Keaton) is something we'll know in the next few weeks. As for me, however, I really do think the film is quite overrated--and the biggest reason is that so much of it I've seen before--such as in Fellini's ""8 1/2"" and a few films that have copied this, such as Woody Allen's ""Stardust Memories"". The movie, at least to crazed film buffs like me, just lacks the originality to be a great film and it seems overrated.<br/><br/>As for the film, it's about a down and out actor who USED to be a big star back when he starred in superhero movies (like Keaton in real life). Now, decades later, he's attempting a comeback-- starring and directing in a Broadway play. The film is, generally, a behind the scenes look at what it's like during a production. But, it is also punctuated with very strange, surreal fantasy scenes--VERY reminiscent of Marcello Mastroianni's little fantasies in ""8 1/2"". In fact, there are so many that it's difficult to know what REALLY is happening at times.<br/><br/>I loved parts of the film. Many little bits and pieces made me smile or connected with me. But, at the same time, I struggled with liking the film because so many of the characters were either completely unlikable or were underdeveloped. This, combined with the unevenness of the script and familiarity of the style, the film didn't do much for me. Did I enjoy seeing it? Not especially, but I am glad I did see it-- and assume folks not familiar with ""8 1/2"" would probably like the film much more than me."

I can't the terrible overacting hold against the actors, they got the job, they do what they're told or what they think they'd have to do. The misery comes from the director and screen writer. After about 10 minutes my mind started to wander off, staring at the endlessly senseless Stedicam camera moves - ahh, oh so fluid and oh so meaningless.

From the very beginning something went terribly wrong - it was the music. This pointless, annoying drumming that would not stop. I am sure this ""music"" was performed by a poorly trained monkey. Then there were those loose pieces of pointless monologue that made no sense. It must have been written by a dysphasia patient. And then I could not help but notice that the dialog was written for merely the sake of producing useless sounds. Kind of like their drumming ""music"". Even worse than anything else about this movie was lack of any mood. Whoever made this horrible waste of video recording technology was obviously on drugs and disgustingly in love with himself: ""oh, look! whatever I do always comes out awesome! and you, common people, must watch this movie standing up and applauding all the time, because if you don't, then any self-important movie critic will tell you that you don't understand art cinema!""

","The tone of this movie changes so often, it is hard to sympathize with the characters. Within a single scene the director suggests we sympathize with the plight of the protagonist and the rest of the cast-- served up with a heavy dose of violins and heartfelt exchanges as they stare deep into each other eyes and wish they had done the right thing long ago-- and then laugh along with them as they trade glib snarky put-downs back and forth to let you know this is a ""real"" backstage look at life in the theater. The audience doesn't have the chance to feel one way or the other, and I don't think the writers know what they are looking for either, so they've thrown the whole mess in there, hoping something will stick. In the end I don't really care if the big Opening Night succeeds or fails. <br/><br/>And then there is the whole scifi overlay-- yes, I get it, the theater-- or in this case, a movie about the theater-- is a higher calling than Hollywood blockbusters.

","Interesting movie explores contrast between fame, celebrity, prestige, and artistic integrity. It does have some good scenes, but the characters are so pretentious and ego-centric that they are not sympathetic. The scene where Michael Keaton locks himself outside the theater and has to run a gauntlet of fans, musicians, and doormen to get back inside the theater in time to do his lines --- that was the highlight of the movie for me. (This was about midway through the film). I still had high expectations for some kind of big moment of self-realization or high drama by the end of the movie. Sadly, the movie did NOT improve but became increasingly nonsensical to the point of being dishonest and manipulative towards the audience. <br/><br/>I've seen similar movies that explore the creative process that were MUCH better than this one: ""The Big Picture"" (1989) and ""Living in Oblivion""(1995). <br/><br/>In a way, this movie reminds me of ""My Dinner with Andre"", a critically successful movie that can only be well understood by theater arts majors (with knowledge of obscure works that most people have NEVER heard of).

"rblenheim","10","15","28","25 February 2015"," Iñárritu gives us another eccentric masterpiece
","Alejandro González Iñárritu's brilliant tour-de-force, ""Birdman"", is a most audacious dark comedy about a cinematic ex-superhero trying to make a comeback with a Broadway play, but that's only the setup. It's unorthodox to a flaw: many will find getting up to speed difficult with its hyper-kinetic madcap burst of verbal fencing amongst its cornucopia of stars (all at the top of their game), headed by Michael Keaton playing the title character.<br/><br/>I deeply love Iñárritu as a filmmaker. His best work conveys a cinematic exuberance that comes close to a Mahler symphony in its scope, forming a synthesis of despair and joyfulness in rendering the human experience. He's made five films to date, each of which won countless awards at Cannes, Venice, the Golden Globes and Academy Award nominations. His first three films comprise a trilogy utilizing intersecting stories, the best of which, ""Babel"" (released in 2006) took a year to shoot in four different countries, and begins with a sheepherder and his two sons in North Africa and culminates with a deaf and dumb naked teenage girl in a penthouse at the top of a skyscraper in Tokyo. It won Iñárritu Best Director at Cannes, and is still Iñárritu's masterpiece. ""Birdman"", however, is a complete about-face from the triptych epic to a simpler, more focused drama with tour-de-force directing that shows him at the peak of his powers.<br/><br/>Iñárritu's camera moves everywhere, gliding and flying about (as if the entire film is virtually one long single take), following actors' movements, going through doorways, behind stages, into the street, even up to the roof and beyond -- while a soundtrack of drums underscores the action like the nervous approach of an intracranial hemorrhage. This is a film that demands much of its viewers, but the intelligent ones who allow themselves to sink into the marvelous mosaic of the experience will find something to revel in, and eagerly want to revisit after getting their breath back. A rich, extravagant celebration in cinema that fully deserved the 2015 Oscar for Best Picture."
"apstewart17","10","15","28","26 October 2014"," What really makes us happy?
","It's not very often a film is made and it it hits you almost too close to home. I myself am an actor. I perform in theatre and aspire to work in film, not because of the glitz and glam, but because I am truthfully and honestly passionate about my craft.<br/><br/>Rigger Thompson, a man who once graced cinema screens as the hero 'Birdman.' After he found the franchise being less an artistic venture, and more so a gimmick, he left. Leaving a 20 year gap where he has never been able to toss the cape and cowl and simply be an actor. This film weighs heavy on what does it mean to be appreciated? and if so, does it make you happy?<br/><br/>First and foremost, Michael Keaton comes forth with a career defining performance. A performance layered with heartbreaking desperation, pent up angst, and unbridled passion. His cynical yet honest view on the world around him can't help but be admired. With his ball busting manager/best friend, his admittedly kooky girlfriend (who is easily at least 15 years younger than him), his distant daughter, and his co-star Edward Norton who is so committed to the theatre that he himself almost can't operate in everyday life. All of these views on life, and the society we live in spiral in front of Riggan like a non-stop vortex of emotion where he begins to doubt himself to a point where schizophrenia takes over.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is absolutely top notch as they do not miss a beat. Emma Stone's heartbreaking monologue as she tries to get her father to open his eyes and face the facts left me speechless. Edward Norton who, in my opinion really shows us what he can do in this film utterly full of himself, but not out of want and need for acceptance, but out of this idea he has crafted for himself. Stage actors live life, where film actors play life. His performance is highly political, and I can't help but agree with most of what he says. Zach Galifianakis does a wonderful job of playing Riggans manager and best friend. Whether or not you agree he is looking out for his friend is u to you, but his want and need for Riggan's success is almost a catalyst for disaster. With that Zach isn't a bad guy, he's sincere, hard working and ultimately committed to his client.<br/><br/>Visually, this film has done what few films even attempt to do. Using the 'one shot' technique where the whole film looks as if it is one seamlessly continuous shot is not only a brilliant piece of camera work, but also gives you the sensation of it unfolding right before your eyes in real life. Using the element of fast film in other pictures with jump cuts and time lapses you loose track of where you are, and what just happened. In this case the transitions are utterly seamless. It is a hoy to watch such beautiful pacing in a film. Something that has not been given the respect it truly deserves.<br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu has written, directed, and produced a film which hinges on life itself. He attacks actors, filmmakers, critics, journalist, Twitter, Facebook, the list goes on. He teaches us that success is not based in monetary value, but what you make of your life, and whether or not what you are doing in your life is truly making you happy.<br/><br/>I am making a statement right now that Birdman is one of the greatest films ever made."

","There are many ways to make your movie different from the others and one of them is by attempting an achievement in the technical department. The director of Birdman made the conscious choice to shoot his whole movie like it is one continuous long take (with an exception near the end).<br/><br/>Well, stunts like that sometimes work, sometimes don't, and in my opinion Birdman is closer to the latter.<br/><br/>It should be better, in my opinion, if it was filmed in a more traditional way. It might not had the spotlight as a technical achievement but I think it would be far more efficient and far more entertaining. The director tied his own hands. He deprived some pretty powerful creative tools, in an effort to be different.<br/><br/>The plot is OK. A delusional, washed-up Hollywood actor famous for playing a superhero (Birdman) in blockbuster movies decades earlier, tries his luck as a performer and a director on a Broadway theater. The other characters in the film his colleagues, his ex-wife, his daughter, are more like secondary characters who serve his story, without actually complete a sub-plot on their own.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton is OK too. I hear about an Oscar nomination (he got a Golden Globe already). Well, people have won Oscars for less.<br/><br/>The film is actual a dramedy, and there is a really funny scene outside of the theater (that the film mostly takes place), which might actually reward you if till that time you thought the film was boring.<br/><br/>So. Is it worth watching? Hm, yes. Why not.<br/><br/>Is it a ""masterpiece"" like I'm reading from some hasty or biased fans? Well No. Far from it.

"tedg","Null","8","13","23 May 2015"," Parasitic Nests
","I have a particular interest in five different cinematic styles, worlds actually. One of them I have named the Hispanic style. It is characterized by:<br/><br/>— elements of magical reality, either in supernatural physics or synchronous connections.<br/><br/>— a belief that the world is rich, fecund. Occasionally female sexuality is interwoven. Characters are both in the world and part of the nature that is rich.<br/><br/>— layered storytelling.<br/><br/>— a laconic camera compared with others, as if there were dream dynamics at world.<br/><br/>— use of color.<br/><br/>It so happens that most of the filmmakers using this style are what in the US we clumsily call *Hispanic*. More well known examples are: Pedro Almodóvar (Spain), Alejandro Amenábar (Chile), Juan José Campanella (Argentina), Alejandro González Iñárritu (Mexico), Alejandro Jodorowsky (Chile), Julio Medem (Spain), Fernando Meirelles (Brazil), Raoul Ruiz (Chile), <br/><br/> and sometimes: Luis Buñuel (Mexico), Alfonso Cuarón (Mexico), Robert Rodriguez (Mexico) and Guillermo del Toro (Mexico).<br/><br/>I like some of the projects these men have completed, simply because they works. Sometimes it transports and is so effective I feel as if healed and placed in a supernatural body. I think these techniques insert into dream urges and carry me in ways I have scant protections against. So I come to an Iñárritu film with some expectation. Some hope. <br/><br/>The problem with this style of filmmaking is that maintaining the technique requires a lot of overhead. Usually all a filmmaker has to worry about is the story and the wrapper. If he/she is a poor filmmaker, it is just a story and the worry is about characters and story structure. The wrapper is the collection of cinematic techniques used to inveigle into our inner narratives. Often this is just reliance on genre and stereotypes. A good filmmaker will worry about this though. For all his flaws, I credit Scorcese with attention to this. But it doesn't get in the way. We don't see it.<br/><br/>With Iñárritu and his peers, much, even most of what we get in the story *and* the wrapper is there to sustain these Hispanic narrative values. It is a matter of the viewer's tolerance, I suppose, in deciding what is too much. Few viewers will give as much allowance as I do, but here I think it is too much: too much in the story; too much in the wrapper.<br/><br/>We are to forgive this because this is a movie about movie-making (theater as movie), and about extreme risk and commitment. <br/><br/>So we have three main folds. These aren't circular, but parallel. The most obvious because it is in the story is the fold of the reality of our main character to the reality of films. That the films involved are his past films is nearly irrelevant. (More relevant is the actor's bast as Batman or for that matter as Betelgeuse - Dogberry - Doug Kinney.) <br/><br/>Also rather explicit is the fold, a common one, of the world of making a movie to the world of the movie we see. Only Emma Stone escapes navigational issues in this one. Everyone else is placed in clumsy roles. I wish I did not allow the perfect elegance of Medem or Almodóvar to color my view of this.<br/><br/>And finally we have the folding of our world into Iñárritu's. But because the clothes are so heavy, we only wear them for the duration of the film. Nothing sticks; no matter how hard I try, I leave this world when the film ends. I only have memories of the machinery and some admiration for the acting. Compare this to the masters. Compare this to things that you fall in love with and never wish to escape."

Is not hard to understand why a lot of people think this movie is boring or it lacks of a good plot, you can find a lot of ""simplistic"" reasons to hate it (i.e. if you don't like jazz you will be annoyed during all the movie).<br/><br/>To understand what Iñarritu tried to express in this movie and to really enjoy it you need first to understand the inclemency and ungratefulness of the entertainment industry, new ""superstars"" are created every year while a whole bunch of ""old not trendy stars"" are left to the oblivion and eventually are forgotten (how many people you remember from the ""in-memoriam"" video every year at the Oscars?... how many ""stars"" you remember for their artistic achievements and not for their latest scandals? or they stereotyped characters: ""the Rambo guy"" the ""terminator guy"" the ""superman guy"" etc). In Birdman, Michael Keaton character was not recognized as a real artist until his emotional instability pushed him to the extreme where he had to shoot himself on stage and then only then, people ""recognized"" him as a true artist and not as the ""birdman"" guy. Before that scene people and media were more interested with him running naked on times square than his new artistic project. This happens all time in real life. Performing artists dedicate their entire life to achieve fame and recognition for their work but it seems they are only remembered by their mistakes or their personal life (who is dating who, who is getting a divorce, who naked pictures are leaked). If I ask you to repeat by memory the name of the last 4 Oscar winners for best male performance vs the name of any 4 ""superstars"" who have played a ""superhero"" character in the last 4 years I bet you will have an easier time answering the second one.<br/><br/>Birdman depicts a reality of our current society. If you change ""birdman"", for ""batman"" this movie is a partial biography of Keaton's journey through Hollywood.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie, without understanding the above, you will not enjoy it... Maybe is a movie made for people who have worked on the entertainment industry. I can assure you that old forgotten stars from the decade of the 70's 80's and 90's will feel very identified by a lot of lines and events in this movie.<br/><br/>Keaton character even ""sacrificed"" his personal life (daughter and wife) for a career that gave him a momentary and partial satisfaction, regardless of his artistic talents.

"theocharous_an","9","6","9","27 December 2016"," What is wrong with people?
","I have a tendency to check user reviews on IMDb before watching a film. I was surprised to see how divided people were for Birdman. Most of the reviews were either 9-10 stars or 1 star. This made me want to watch the film even more and by the time I finished watching it, my faith in people had decreased by a little bit. <br/><br/>Birdman is brilliant! This is not just an opinion, I wouldn't even consider it as one of my favourite films, I didn't even give 10 stars. When I say it is brilliant, I don't mean that I liked it too much, I mean that every aspect of the film is masterfully dealt with. Sublime acting, excellent cinematography, interesting and unconventional directing and a wonderfully original score. OK there wasn't a fast-paced plot with lots of plot twists, but not every movie has to be like this. One of the reviewers who gave one star complained about the plot and suggested to the readers to go watch a Kubrick film instead. Well, Kubrick himself made movies with minimal plot which were nevertheless proved to be masterpieces (2001: A space Odyssey, Eyes Wide Shut). He once said: ""A film is (or should be) more like music than fiction"". Films are supposed to make us think and feel, like music does. You can make a good song by adding story-like lyrics and you can make a good song by adding no lyrics at all. The same applies to movies. There are plot-driven masterpieces and there are no-plot- driven masterpieces. Birdman is one of the latter.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the film. I just want to say that I would highly recommend it for anyone, except people who only want to see pointless action and superhero films. Birdman will make you think, reflect on similar situations you might have experienced and discover the other side of actors and films. I can absolutely understand people not liking it. There is not a single film that appeals to everyone. What I cannot understand though is people calling it a bad movie."

They gave me the impression that it was a dark comedy of a mid-life crisis; it is that I suppose though not particularly funny but it is also at heart nihilistic though it doesn't give us a lot of reasons why with the characterizations.<br/><br/>A strange film: the plot is not original but the direction and exposition is. Michael Keaton carries the film very well and is a likable actor; on occasion I felt he was acting at acting, maybe that's appropriate in a film showing actors acting in a play, but his despair at times seemed forced.<br/><br/>Anyway that's it for me, a film of many parts that simply went on too long, and too far down a road to nothingness."

"PartialMovieViewer","1","27","57","3 February 2015"," Bad – Awful – Horrible – and I am Being Nice
","Obviously I did not like this movie. There was no beginning – no middle – and no ending. For me – one big question mark led to another and then to another and then to another – pretty much non-stop. The story might have been more digestible had there been answers to the questions – but there were none. Additionally, that jittery, jumpy camera work - so awe-inspiring for some critics - was just plain irritating to me. Also, I did not care about this mythical ego-battle between Hollyweird and ""The THEATER."" This phony megalomania is false, since it is easily squashed when THEATER elites are offered a shot at the big screen. Once Tinsel-Town beckons, those bright lights of Broadway quickly become short-lived memories, vanishing as soon as the twinkling radiance disappears from the actor's rear-view-mirror. Oh and the actors, what happened? Every character (with the exception of the Zach Galifianakis') was not just flawed, but were all socially destroyed. Every scene opened with whimpering or fighting or complaining – it was one emotional train-wreck after another. ""Birdman"" was definitely no comedy, that is for sure. Other than the relief I felt leaving the cinema, I can only site one redeeming scene. That scene would have to be the snarky spat between the Michael Keaton character and the THEATER critic. This obvious demonizing of critics was so well woven into the story, with subtle intent. It didn't really appear that important to the movie's success. Oh but I think it was vital. Even if the scene of the two of them arguing came across as your typical, ""Birdman"", scene-by-scene mindless banter, I feel there was another reason for this. To me, it appears as a very successful 'warning-off' of negative reviews - and for that I say bravo and award one star. To be truthful, I had a hard time writing this review. I did not like this movie, and espousing my negativity was easy. That is not where my problem lies. On other movies, I actually agree with what many views my fellow reviewers' have penned in the past. On this flick, I must disagree. This movie was not my favorite; is not my favorite, and will never be my favorite."

","If you're a fan of dialog-driven ""tour-de-force"" ensemble acting movies then ""Birdman"" is for you. Besides the great cast and script, the real star of the film is the D.P. Emmanuel Lubezki. He weaves technical magic with the camera and in the editing room; about 100 of the movie's 119 minutes are made to look like one almost seamless take, with no cuts. The single-camera, extended tracking-shot style pioneered by Hitchcock and refined by Kubrick, Orson Welles, Scorsese and a few other directors, is taken to a whole new level here. Even with the crisp, snappy non-stop dialog, some camera tricks took me out of the story just long enough for me to wonder how in hell it was achieved. I'm sure Academy Award nominations are in store for the cinematography and editing as well as for director Alejandro Iñárritu. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton has been given the definitive role of his career, and he puts the opportunity to good use. The supporting ensemble cast is also great; it's obvious everybody sank their teeth into their roles with abandon. The level of intensity is on a par with ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" - the groundbreaking 1966 movie about four people having emotional meltdowns. In this story, it's Keaton's central character who's losing his grip on reality, and the audience is along for the ride on a hot rail to Hell.<br/><br/>There is a lot of wit and humor to balance out the pathos though - it's not an unrelenting downer by any stretch. And the final scene is ambiguous enough to allow the viewer to decide for him/herself if it's tragic or joyous. I thought that was a nice touch.<br/><br/>A few caveats: Edward Norton's self-centered asshole actor character is a bit one-dimensional, occasionally over-the-top, but always interesting, if not a scene-stealer. A few parts of the script are predictable (I was anticipating some lines of dialog before they were spoken), and the story premise itself isn't original, but has had variations done many times before (a middle- aged former superstar actor/athlete/lawyer/criminal who's fallen on hard times goes for one last shot at redemption in a winner-takes- all gamble). Having said that, the combined talents in this endeavour manage to put together an extraordinary work of art, flaws and all, and for those who are tired of Hollywood drivel with caped crusaders and CGI explosions, this is the right antidote. A feast for the eyes, ears and brain. Four stars."

I was so hyped for this movie when I read what is was about and when I saw the cast, but thank god my friend bought it before me, now I don't have to spend any money on it. It's kinda sad actually, I had such good hopes and then as I watched the movie I got more and more disappointed. There is no tension, no good quotes, no action, it is very predictable and to be honest without so many star actors this movie would suck even more. The actors themselves played good but the movie as a whole is just a disaster. I don't get why this is being nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. The whole time you wait for something exciting to happen and when it does they don't even do it properly. I mean after one hour you get just annoyed of the main character, he's so insecure and when you think he finally got himself together he screws it up again. Well, I guess bad movies have to be made, too ;)"
"billygoat1071","9","19","38","30 January 2015"," Dazzling Satire
","Birdman pictures how celebrities deal with the mid-life of their careers, as they often try to win back their glory days, but struggles with their personal demons. The movie centers a man who is haunted by his past and seeking to transcend himself to a project where he can be respected. It is presented in one very long take on how he works in this particular stage play, while also being challenged by his personal life issues and his superhero role, as a pigment of his imagination, discouraging that he will never be as good as he was. Birdman is best described as magnificent, easily by its craft and terrific performances. It insanely presents this thespian's attempt of redemption and the conflict of cultural changes. It is often meant to be comical, but there's a strange value to that.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't always take itself seriously. Other than having a fantasy of being tormented by his iconic superhero role, the story often makes a joke about the industry, how today's view to true art is hardly valuable, and attention towards worn out careers gains better in controversies. It just keeps pushing the harshness to the main character until he completely lose his mind. This is a total satire, but the big picture here is Riggan's ego, the movie often explores that and his psychosis, and how it is messing with his career and his show. People would wonder why most of their conversations have to be too broad in drama and comedy, but then, this is about poking fun at this generation of fame, which is either meant to display humorous or awkwardly tragic.<br/><br/>The characters are excellently defined, although they're pretty much the most bitter and weirdest people you'd encounter on screen, but it's still entertaining when they attack each other by their words that can either be reasonable or not. It's the actors that brought the utter pizazz. This film might as well be for Michael Keaton, the actor's talent has been taken for granted lately and it takes for a prestige project like this to remember what he could actually deliver as an actor. Keaton lends a real character, making Riggan's constant insanity feel truly substantial than plain ridiculous, yet the emotions stay real when the scenario shifts to seriousness. The supporting cast is splendid as well, with Edward Norton brilliantly delivers something memorable out of his obnoxious method actor character. And Emma Stone surprises, especially in one scene where you can leave yourself nearly breathless.<br/><br/>For its filmmaking alone, the movie is sensational. Sure, the single, nearly endless take has been done by several movies before, but nothing goes this far like Birdman. But not only the camera-work that has gone beyond limits, the cinematography brings life and makes stunning shots in every angle. The movie just shoots these things like it's unimaginable, of course there are tricks to cover up the interconnected cuts, but it never matters since it already overwhelms by how it keeps it moving, from doors to hallways.<br/><br/>The film ends with a mystery, but we can easily see what all of that means. Birdman is just one grand satire that explains how difficult to appeal the modern audience if you belong in a different era of the industry when you were better. The movie embraces the whole ridicule, but the real impact belongs to its technical achievement, as it perfectly reflects what's going on, turning things into larger-than- life. It may get too crazy, but there's no exception how extremely entertaining the experience is."

As an artist, I was instantly drawn in with the visual concept, pacing, absolutely believable acting, and wonderful drum-kit music score. Films like this are definitely not for everyone, but these types of films move our culture forward, and show what is possible in the medium. Film can be so much more than the standard, superficial Hollywood fare, eye-candy and sentimental melodrama are great, but sometimes I want something that is real and truly heart-felt.

","Michael Keaton is back. He thoroughly dominates this movie. He drives it forward, he makes it happen. Keaton's presence is so powerful that it shapes the entire story. This movie is about personal identity, artistic integrity, and the meaning of life. What is someone supposed to do if they believe that their life is a sham and a waste? At what point does the actor as artist stop dishing out garbage to earn a buck? How is one supposed to make sense out of their life when they believe they are a sell out? The story is set in the perfect place to deal with these issues. Where else but in a theater can such varied themes be played out? One can empathize with Riggan's plight as his self-doubt more and more conflicts with his need to achieve something worthwhile. Can he do it? Or is he merely a hack trying to pass himself off as something that he is not? He believes himself to be a failure yet does not accept it. This contradiction generates a tidal wave of emotion that makes Riggan such an incredible character."

I don't have any problem with foul language in movies, but the dialog between the actors is pointless trash talk.

There's not an ounce of inspiration in the troupe doing the Broadway play, just going through the motions of a daily pressure cauldron that grinds you up and spits you out.

His direction brings a whole rawness to the story and characters that makes them believable.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is incredible. You feel like you're at Broadway witnessing this character driven drama and immerses you throughout the film. The story handles so many themes and ideas like Family, Hollywood, Critics and many more to a point where you feel worried whether the film can convey so much in a runtime of 2 hours but I can assure you everything is handled perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a MASTERPIECE!

"harrylosborne","8","2","2","25 February 2019"," As surreal as it is cinematically impressive
","Birdman is artistically novel in its use of a ""single"" take: the first 15-20 minutes is one continuous shot, weaving through the fuddled depths of backstage theatre between cast and crew. The colours throughout are key to these shots not becoming tiresome - bright neons and glowing warm lights bathe the set, emphasising the emotions felt in each scene. Perhaps my favourite part of the film, however, is the seamless interlinking of both scenes and music. More than once, the near constant drumming accentuates scenes so well, along with the amazing orchestration of movement in and out of the theatre itself.<br/><br/>As for the cast, you couldn't ask for much more - Keaton is great as a slightly haywire actor on the brink (with his alter ego muttering alongside him), but Norton shows his true ability by nailing the range of an aggressive, temperamental but caring theatre journeyman devoted to his work above all else. Stone, Galifianakis and Riseborough also lend their talents well.<br/><br/>Birdman is worth watching purely to admire the feat of stringing these long takes together: however, a worthwhile plot and intriguing development also gives this film an edge not seen often in cinema today."

He wants to do something else besides a cartoon character which is what he did best. It is interesting to note that Zach Galifianakis breaks out of his funny man role and does something serious...which was not as entertaining as his funny man role.<br/><br/>The acting was great. Emma stone had her scene where she lets loose on her dad about life. In fact the star liners were all given the scene to shine and they performed it well. The Birdman flashbacks reminded me a little of Jake Gyllenhaal"" ""Enemy"" as you see the impossible, but in this case it was clearly Riggan's imagination...maybe.<br/><br/>I could see where this film would appeal to a certain type of movie going audience who like plot, theme, characters, and an under lying metaphor as well as a connection to the plays of the author it presents.

","I'll start by saying this movie is worth seeing at least once, at least to see what it is doing. It is shot much like Hitchcock's *Rope*, though not exactly. It isn't all one shot, but there are many shots that flow from scene to scene. The catch? Those scenes are not always chronologically continuous. This is a fact you very well might miss if you are distracted or have something inhibiting you (the theatre I watched it in first however many years ago had abysmal audio, so this was me the first time).<br/><br/>This may sound disorienting, but if you change the way you are viewing the movie, I think it will help. Don't look at it as a standard movie: instead, view it as a stage play whose stage is an entire neighborhood, mostly one building, and which was mostly captured as it was being performed by a cameraman. This means that the actors moving in and out of scene have the same flow that a stage play has, and this also explains the presence of the drummer that you randomly see in the background performing the soundtrack to the movie. (Yes, the soundtrack is mostly a drummer; it works really well somehow.)<br/><br/>There's only one tiny wrench in this, the movie has all sorts of elements that are generally assumed to be hallucinations or imaginings of the main character (Keaton). In different scenes where he is alone, we see him using various telekinetic powers. Occasionally, we actually see his younger self as Birdman (an action-movie role from his younger days) in person, although usually he just antagonizes him via voice over. Some of the few hard cuts in the movie that do not follow an actor from one room to another are used to establish that the telekinesis in the previous scene is probably just Keaton throwing stuff around the room in anger.<br/><br/>How to reconcile this is... well, difficult. It certainly plays with the tension between stage plays and movies. In neither is everything you see always taken literally, but in stage plays it is much more figurative (hence the bending of time and space from scene to scene). But on stage, you usually can't perform the kinds of special effects (characteristic of movies) that we are being asked not to take literally. (I'm trying to stay spoiler free, so I'll not say what I'm thinking right now.)<br/><br/>This is where we should look at the themes of the movie, because these formal elements in conflict that I mentioned mirror the thematic conflict between cinema and theatre. Long story short, the premise of the mov... (movie? . . . stageplay? . . . ) ...of the story is that Keaton is a has-been actor, known (very well known) for superhero movies he did ten or twenty years ago, all based around a character named Bat*coughs* I mean, Birdman.<br/><br/>Sound familiar? Okay, good. Well the inciting incident in the story is that he is trying to reclaim his career as an actor in general, and with it his artistic street-cred, so to speak, by writing (adapting), directing, and starring in a play. It is based on a novel by someone who encouraged him to be an actor when he was a child. Therefore, this isn't a move of cold calculation, trying to get famous again after years of not being as successful as he was as Birdman and therefore being artistically inauthentic, although he is certainly accused of this. But it is instead a very real attempt to reconnect with his younger, artistic self, before Birdman, which he sees as the inauthentic detour of his career and as not what he wants to be remembered for.<br/><br/>The conflict is, he seems to be finding that the film world doesn't translate to the stage world. He seems to be hitting the problem that there may not be such a thing as an ""actor-in-general"" but only two separate things called ""stage-actor"" and ""screen-actor."" On multiple occasions, this film criticizes the spectacles that saturate Hollywood and the celebrity culture it grows in the Petri dish of its award shows. Edward Norton plays his foil, someone else who finds himself on stage more than he does in his natural life, yet a stage insider, rather than a film one.<br/><br/>The film isn't all anti film culture, however. In many ways, film has its last laugh when we see that the kinds of things that make the theatre-world fall in love with you and fawn over your talent are superficial as well.<br/><br/>The formal conflict inherent in how the film is delivered therefore mirrors the thematic content that is being delivered, which is almost always the optimum result.<br/><br/>In other words, I have a lot of respect for this movie. I rate it 9 stars because that is how I say I think everyone should give it a fair chance."
"martinsop","9","2","2","4 July 2018"," Nothing Like It
","Some of the best performances I've ever seen. Emma Stone is my personal favorite in this film. Her monologue is memorable and raw. 
Micheal Keaton's character, despite being a burnt out actor living in NYC, goes through the same struggles and has the same insecurities as the average person. His character is complex. 
A very creative and original film overall even though the summary may sound a bit basic, the director's approach to the film is very innovative. Great script and cinematography as well. 
The main thing that I loved about Birdman is that it made you think and want to talk about it. Its message is also very relevant to today's society. 
I've yet to see another movie like Birdman."
"JustineAssad","5","11","20","9 June 2015"," Ultimately a let-down
","Like a lot of other people, I suppose, I wanted to see this film because of all the critical praise it garnered; and I think it safe to say that also like a lot of other people: I just didn't understand all the critical praise it garnered.<br/><br/>Of course, it is easy to understand that it was technically masterful, but on the other hand – it was not something that has never been done before. Aside from seeing Keaton in a wonderfully-apt role, a role which was well-acted, there really wasn't much else going on here. None of the other characters felt well-developed, and they almost felt entirely perfunctory – most of the supporting characters' plot-lines went nowhere and left you wondering why their scenes were incorporated into the movie at all - the kiss between Watts and Riseborough being a glaring point here. This could really have been a one-man show. Then there was the ""score,"" the ""soundtrack."" There is a reason an all-drums score has never been done before. It's because it's annoying as fack. It was almost enough to make me want to put the DVD on mute and flip the subtitles on and just read the damn thing. This is only the second movie I've seen (the first being the grating, ear-blistering Picnic at Hanging Rock) where the music has annoyed me to the point of apoplexy. <br/><br/>At the end of the day: I was rather disappointed by this film, and I'm not a chicken when it comes to cerebral cinema; I like movies that make me think, that initially confuse the b'Jesus out of me only to be delighted by the epiphany (Mulholland Drive being the prime example). I once read that sometimes, in literature, people confuse an abstruse narrative for masterful writing and I think the same can be applied to film; not everything 'complex' or 'profound' is necessarily masterful cinema. Sometimes it's just a convoluted mess. While I won't go so far as to say it was one of the worst films I've seen in the past year or so, it certainly wouldn't win my 'Best Picture,' and I reckon it was interesting in its uninteresting way. <br/><br/>Good performances, technically interesting to watch but there are much better films out there to spend two hours watching. Also: if you're going into this expecting a comedy, you're in for big a surprise..."

","Four Academy Awards. Really? I get art films and even like a few. However, this one is too much. The plot was extremely weak. The special effects, stupid. It seems Michael Keaton was trying to revive his portrayal of Batman, but missed the mark. I really like Michael Keaton's films and I think he is a great actor. He is probably the only reason I risked seeing this. Him and Edward Norton actually. Both of these fellas did well with what they had, but there just wasn't enough substance for them to pull this out of the dumper. So we have a Hollywood actor who was fighting his commercial success playing a super hero in movies by wanting to do meaningful, Broadway stage acting. Just another example of highly paid actors whining and crying their craft just doesn't mean enough so they go do something stupid.<br/><br/>Let's be clear actor folks, we don't go to movies, we don't go to see stage plays looking for meaningful, life changing events. We go to be ENTERTAINED...period! My wife and I don't walk out on movies once we get into them, but the most entertaining part of this film was watching the ""Run Pee"" app tick away on my iPhone! For the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to award this film one Oscar would have been ridiculous. For them to have awarded FOUR (including best picture), total joke.

The other premise is the Hollywood love for crappy superhero movies, but the amount of nonsense that it brings to the movie with no connection between itself is ridiculous. Go watch Twin Peaks and learn how to do it. And than the shoot your nose... WTF! i have no idea if it has just laziness, or the writer just did not gave a damn about what i was supposed to watch.

Ed Norton also strong, as was the rest of the cast although Zach Galifianakis delivered one of the weaker, more one-note performances. Though this film, for me, didn't seem to be about the actors.

"GeorgeRoots","10","10","18","9 January 2015"," Birdman Soars (Literally...)
","It's one of those rare pleasures when you look forward to a film that was announced all the way back in December 2012, finally arrives and becomes your favourite movie of 2014. With a title like ""Birdman"", what was I expecting? I remember hearing it was going to be a washed up actor trying to branch out after a lifetime of being known as a popular Hollywood movie superhero. To then hear that Michael Keaton was going to be our lead, it was now obvious that life was going to imitate art as Keaton has always been my favourite actor to play ""Batman"". A few trailers kept my interest peaked throughout the waiting time, and even after the movie was released October 2014, being in the U.K we still had to wait till January 2015. I've now seen the movie twice in one week, the first time was to admire how brilliantly paced the film was with the performances being fantastic archetypes, and secondly to see how all the dialogue reflects the coded visuals and psyche of the narrative.<br/><br/>Riggan Thomas (Michael Keaton), was well known to movie theatre audiences for portraying a super hero called ""Birdman"". Now broke and forgotten, he prepares a comeback by reinventing himself as a director/actor by staging an adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story, ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". As the play continues to progress, the actors are not up to cut and the premiere date is ever-nearing. Riggan is having difficulties over his private life such as his rehabilitated daughter/assistant (Emma Stone), his talented yet demanding supporting actor (Edward Norton) and a slew of other problems await. Ultimately his sanity begins to unravel as life imitates art, the differences between art and commerce are false when satisfying an ego, and Riggan's apparent ""superpowers"" and ""Birdman"" conscience is the only way out of all this mess.<br/><br/>Director Alejandro González Iñárritu went above and beyond with this movie. It's been purposefully designed to look like it was all one long take, and the pacing and energy works really well when you're working in the tight confines of a theatre. It's been supposedly announced that people told him not to do it, but the movie flows seamlessly because of this and the fact that Emmanuel Lubezki's highly imaginative Cinematography goes above and beyond (Lubezki was responsible for the long 15 minute takes of Alfonso Cauron's ""Gravity"", for which he won an Oscar). The music is the first soundtrack work of Mexican drummer Antonio Sánchez, and it's entirely made up of Percussion instruments that when played on cue reflect both the upcoming events of the scenario, and Sánchez's drummer friend actually appears on screen during the moments of the main characters aggressively fractured mind.<br/><br/>If you plan to see ""Birdman"" just to see a superhero movie you're wasting your time. I enjoy Hollywood blockbusters as much as anyone else, but I knew from the beginning it was an affectionate and well done parody on what's trending at the moment. The film has a surprising amount to say about remaining relevant in the age of social media, and the characters efforts to refrain from any comments be it critic or audience sadly proves detrimental to his comeback. The film is Michael Keaton's first leading role in quite some time, and he nails it perfectly. I've always enjoyed him as a performer and wished he got to work a little more recently, but this is the role no other actor can play when regarding just how versatile he is given the wonderful ironic situation. Emma Stone was wonderful as always, Edward Norton got to parody himself, Naomi Watts does great and returns from the directors previous work ""21 Grams"" (2003), and finally Zach Galifianakis was great and kind of represented the only grounded reality in this crazy tale.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: When all is said and done, the best way to explain ""Birdman, or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" is to see it again and again and get more out of it. It will polarise you and may seem a little lacklustre on surface, but there is a deep well of thought going on under it all and the technicality and craft was executed perfectly. It's destined to be one of those great films I've seen about making art like Federico Fellini's ""8-1/2"" (1963) and Charlie Kaufman's ""Synecdoche, New York"" (2008), but all in all the wait was most definitely worth it. 10/10."

You yearn mindless action when it gives you profundity, you expect hapless simplicity when it gives you intellectual complexity. And you expect to be spoon-fed when it wants you to ponder.<br/><br/>Do not let expectations rule your decisions. This isn't a film for the meagre minds who expect to clap their cymbals in harmony with some of the drivel that are shown on today's silver screen. If it is your heart felt opinion that The Avengers deserves an Oscar, then don't bother watching this film.<br/><br/>Birdman is a heavily nuanced yet eloquent visual art form. It is different. And it requires the audience to flow with the unconventional rhythm of the film rather than expect rigid logic and conventional storytelling. We are allowed to explore the character's purlieu while empathising with his inner mediocrity. It aims to express the level of malaise one experiences when he fails to achieve what he feels he deserves. The film may not answer all the questions it creates, but that's the beauty of it.<br/><br/>Watch it without petty expectations, and appreciate it for what it is. A cinematic ballet; an experience. However, not everyone can comprehend it. The thing is, if you think that it's beyond you as to why this film is so critically acclaimed, then it probably is and there might be a problem.

I wanted to watch it just because I saw in the past some films by its director, films that I still enjoy like ""21 grams"", ""biutiful"" or ""amores perros"".<br/><br/>This ""Birdman"" was a huge disappointment. Very early in the film you'll understand that the whole picture consists of one (supposedly one) single single (which seems to be not true, as there are come cuts there), something not new, as Alexander Sokurov made the same with his ""Russian Ark"" in 2010 (although the Russian film seems to be truly one single shot film, with no CGI. And that's it.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton's performance is - in my opinion - above average, and there are some quite nice compositions here and there, but a film can NOT be just that. The plot is too simple, the soundtrack is annoying and the intrigue is not there at all. I see no ""art"" nor ""artsy"" substance in this film. I read some reviews where some people praise/mock its ""artsy"" approach, but besides some very few details the film follows the cliché pattern of most films present in the Oscars annual competition.<br/><br/>So my question stays: Art?

"albertusjohannesmaria","1","18","37","7 March 2015"," The emptiness of Birdman makes me sad
","Some of my very favorite movies are about the subject of taking a look behind the curtains of the movie industry. I'm talking about the brilliant films All About Eve and Sunset Boulevard. Both movies featured an actress, struggling with age and a declining career. As I am writing this I realize why I probably loved these film's anti hero's and why I hate Birdman: only women are awesome when hysterical, definitely not men. Lately I kind of start to hate modern 'art house' movies. These movies take themselves so seriously, and that's why they are so boring. In my opinion, opposite a cynical character should be a lovable and warm character. But in the movies of especially this Inarrity guy, all characters drown in their indulging misery. It's like you, the movie goer, is forced to agree with him, which I completely reject. I hated 21 Grams and Biutiful, but I only realized after starting Birdman. I couldn't make it till the end of neither one of the 3 films. Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with misery. I watch many documentaries on the most terrible subjects. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why I dislike Inarritu films, only vague notions come to my mind. Manipulation, shallowness and narcissism embody the undercurrent.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The first time I watched Birdman I couldn't get past 15 minutes. I hated it. I got so frustrated of the confusing images and sounds. I had expected something completely different about a Broadway actor's tragedy.<br/><br/>I started reading about this movie and after a couple of week I thought I give it another try. I did, and I managed to finish the movie. <br/><br/>First of all, I still don't understand what all the hype is about. There have been so many films before that surrealistic imagery and dualistic characters. However, maybe for the young public this is their first multi layered movie. Modern about Birdman is the 'found footage' aspect and the acting out personalities. Todays people terrorize the world with their tantrums. Me me me. The swearing and verbal violence is actually horrible. Has society really lost all dignity? There wasn't one person going for a higher goal than attention seeking. <br/><br/>This time I didn't hate Birdman. This time I feel sad for the director and cast and the academy. Despite the long running of this film nobody really touches any emotion, not with me. I think Alejandro Inarritu really thinks he is as great as Billy Wilder and Alfred Hitchcock were, but he isn't. Not by far. The filming engineerings might be awesome but the personages have no soul. The emptiness of Birdman makes me sad. <br/><br/>Only Michael Keaton has enough screen time to somehow get close to him, the rest of the cast has too little screen time. They all get an introduction and then a belting out scene and that's it. I didn't like any actor in this movie except Keaton. It's not their fault but the all to clear purpose that this movie had to become Oscar bait."

On paper, the premise seems interesting, a washed out action movie star making a comeback to prove that he can act, but the movie is a letdown. That the central character is schizophrenic is clear five minutes into the movie, but what about the others? Their past, present and future does not evoke much curiosity, except perhaps Edward Norton's character. The acting is superb no doubt, but it's all for a lost cause. The stellar cast can only do so much when the script is a letdown. The single shot style and the loud drums are irritating and distracting. The movie ends with a lot of questions unanswered, where does the truth end and fantasy takes over? But by then, you no longer care. One star for the acting (Edward Norton especially) and the other for the bar scene involving the showdown between the ""has been star"" and the ""theatre critic""."

","BIRDMAN OR (THE UNEXPECTED VIRTUE OF IGNORANCE) (2014) **** Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Amy Ryan, Andrea Riseborough, Lindsay Duncan. Keaton delivers the goods in an Oscar worthy triumph as a washed-up former star of the titular superhero that gave him fame and fortune as he attempts a comeback and shot at redemption in bankrolling a vanity piece on Broadway adapting Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" that has its share of problems namely a troubled production, egotistical Norton out to train wreck the show, family struggles with his ex, Ryan and recently rehabbed daughter Stone and a thisclose to a nervous breakdown taking root with his inner voice (and demons) deadly to implode (or explode) at any given moment. Filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarrito (who co-wrote the inventive screenplay with Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinerlaris & Armando Bo) uses broad, yet carefully maintained, strokes between fantasy and reality with a lot of meta going on (pokes at inner jokes among its cast in-real-life having played Batman, Gwen Stacy and The Hulk) succeeds in incorporating its seemingly continuous one-take look (credit ace cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and sharp editing by Douglas Crise & Stephen Mirrione) keeps his cast on its toes. The percussive score by Antonio Sanchez is a jazzy Greek chorus of sorts that keeps the beat relentless and steady-as-she goes. But once again it is Keaton's bravura turn mixing heartbreak and black comedy with shades of Shakespearean tragic drama. One of the year's best."

","To really know the true depths of how a movie obtains an Oscar is probably one I wish not to know.<br/><br/>I think the real travesty here is how self-obsolvement and pretentiousness became a Virtue in Hollywood. <br/><br/>It gives me Hope that there are those who would rate this a 1 star and see through the Moral Quagmire that it is. <br/><br/>Not being a Movie-goer and the likes I am sometimes unknowingly manipulated into hanging on to the end of a film that I would otherwise either walk out of or button up and or down from the remote. What the director has done here is develop a continuous train wreck that sparkles the sub-conscience to the point where your eyes are uncontrollably affixed. <br/><br/>With quick witty lines, continuous movement and an unforeseen altercations that could erupt at any moment it comes across as a film that has captured the imagination when in reality its just a Copperfield-ish stunt to lead you to the magical tune of Moral Decay. <br/><br/>As if our lives aren't Hard enough trying to elevate Society to that above Jerry Springer Status, we have reached the more Sophisticate and Artful form by which we measure Self-worth. Here in the form of Theatre, how brilliant!!. How great we are!! We have elevated ourselves above the Springer-ites, for we are better than they who are nothing more than mere trailer trash espousing all that there petty lives are for the World to see. We will show them that we are more than that, that we can express our Depravity in a more eloquent fashion. May the low-lifes be forever indebted to our magnificence that we so painstakingly and givingly bestow upon them daily.<br/><br/>This seems to be a true reflection of Hollywood. They should be given the Freedom of expression as much as any other individual should. Commonly Hollywood espouses to be just like you and I. This is likely true, for some rated this film 10 stars for the very same reasons that I rated it 1. And this is the true portrayal of what is now a World Society in its most Artful and Sophisticted form. Hollywood is the basis for what all films are judged and the Judges have been generationally Depraved from all that is good and right. Black is White and White Black, up is down and down up. May the Judge be Judged himself one day. For all that is virtuous is worth preserving and that the Depraved is worth righteous Judgement.<br/><br/>In Case there was doubt, yes I am talking to you Oscar Judges, you are not like the lowly man who cleans your toilets. Only your inner circle really understands you because you are all woven from the same tapestry. Your daily surrounded by mirrors but still unable to see who you really are. If those reflections on the walls could reveal who you really are, you would be sad and ashamed. However, you glory in your shame and share it with the World to see and attach Medals and adulation to your cause. Oh how regretful and empty you will be in your last days. Deafness, Blind and Muted would be better for you than to be accounted for all the Depravity you have spread."

I finally pluck up courage to look at the reviews of people like me who think films should entertain, even if being a little didactic at times (i.e. user reviews, not critics' reviews), expecting to be sharply put in my place as an ignorant and uncultured yob, but -- lo and behold! -- I am heartened beyond measure to find masses of one star reviews, which say exactly what I would have striven to say, only far, far better than I could manage. Apart from well deserved epithets, such as boring, pretentious, overcooked, nonsensical, I would for my part add 'dangerously unhealthy', because the incessant high-pitched rapid jabber of the meaningless dia- or mono-logue, together with the horrid drummy non- music soundtrack, gave me a really unpleasant headache.Like others, I continued watching because I thought it could only get better, certainly not worse. How wrong I was! I will not condescend further to detailed examination: I would advice anyone interested to read the excellent one-star reviews by other reviewers, better than which I cannot do.

This movie uses the characters to tell you how artistic and important the movie itself is. And by doing that dares critics to criticize it. I think that's why it got so many positive professional reviews. Like loving a hideous handbag with a designer name. None of the characters are likable. The movie has no real plot or point.

Let me just say ""Thank God for my hearing loss"", since it only cost me $1.50 to rent.<br/><br/>Anyway, I watched with great anticipation as I am a Michael Keaton and Edward Norton fan. While I know it got all kinds of awards and accolades, it just wasn't for me. It had a whole ""Being John Malkovich"" meets ""Chicago"" feel to it. It felt like the director thought the more unconventional the movie was, the better it would be. I guess that works for the artsy-fartsy Academy types, but not for me. And from the beginning, I kept wondering when the annoying drum score was going to stop....and I'm a drummer! <br/><br/>As for Michael Keaton's acting, it was great. Although I felt like he felt trapped in his character. The scene where he flashed a brief smile and then was told to stop smiling felt real since I think he may have actually tried to be himself for a second and had to be reminded to get back into the dark character he played.<br/><br/>I understand this movie employed something called ""Magical Realism"" or some such nonsense. I enjoy magic and I enjoy realism but apparently not the two mixed together. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen to put it all together and give it that ""Oh wow!"" factor, but it never did. Instead, I was subjected to several ""interpersonal relationships that delved into the human psyche"" and try to figure out what the director is trying to ""say"". It's the same kind of ""man's inhumanity to man"" mumbo jumbo. So rather than sit here and write how terrible the movie was, I will simply say that it wasn't my cup of tea and I'm guessing that the general public probably feels the same way.

","I am amazed that ""Birdman"" ever got made, but not surprised at all that little American creative talent was involved in making this film. It's too good for Hollywood.<br/><br/>Most people know the premise by now: a one-time movie star, known primarily for his appearances as a superhero, is trying to reinvent himself as a Broadway star, writing, directing and starring in an adaptation of a Raymond Carver story. A bold choice, for certain.<br/><br/>In a standard Hollywood film, Riggan Thomson (embodied wonderfully by Michael Keaton; I'd like to know how close the Academy vote was for Best Actor) would have faced a predictable story arc, culminating in Riggan's triumph at the end. I am not saying that doesn't happen, and I am not saying that it does. What I am saying is that at no point can you be entirely sure which way this film is going. <br/><br/>That's because director Alejandro González Iñárritu is too clever a filmmaker for that. He took the technique pioneered by Orson Welles in ""Touch of Evil"" and developed its full potential. Connoisseurs of cinema know it well: the first six minutes of that film are in one continuous six-minute take, packing in half the information the audience needs to understand everything that's coming.<br/><br/>Iñárritu understands the sort of choreography, blocking, and basic effects needed to pull that off, and in ""Birdman"" he does this over and over again, using the tracking camera to change perceptions and to make transitions from one character's point of view to another. Not only is it excellent cinema, the technique also increases the sense of theater: to pull these shots off, the actors have to rehearse over and over and over until the single smooth long take can be accomplished without tricks. All that's added is a jazz drum score by Antonio Sanchez. (This is the only original music in the film, and, while it does its job, and does it well, you'd never buy the album unless you really like drum solos.)<br/><br/>The story is complex, multi-layered and driven by character; Clint Eastwood is all but alone among American directors when it comes to placing character at the center of a story. We are treated to many of Riggan's demons, not the least of which is the goading voice of Birdman, who would love to get his job back. He's also plagued by family problems; his daughter Sam (Emma Stone, very believable as a spoiled Hollywood brat) is, due to her personal history, unemployable except as her father's personal assistant, and it's not a recipe for familial harmony. We also never quite know with Riggan what's real and what's not; Iñárritu treads that tightrope with finesse.<br/><br/>Edward Norton adds plenty of sparks as Mike Shiner, a certified Broadway star. It would be very easy to wreck the train in this part; for all I know, Norton might actually be the vain artiste with a highly overdeveloped sense of his importance and the value of his extreme methods; what matters is that at no time does the aroma of ham ever come from him. I've never seen Norton better.<br/><br/>The film nicely skewers the entire Broadway scene as well; if ""Birdman"" is your first exposure to Broadway, nobody could blame you if you never bought a ticket. The scenes with nasty Broadway critic Tabitha (British TV actress Lyndsay Duncan) had to have been pure malicious joy to write and play. Safe to say people like me apparently aren't very welcome in the theatrical world.<br/><br/>I believe most audiences will be as entertained as was I, and the more discerning viewers will want to watch this film several times in order to fully understand Iñárritu's art. This will be a hard one to top."
"abouhelier-r","10","11","21","27 February 2015"," Birdman
","A washed-up actor, who once played an iconic superhero, battles his ego and attempts to recover his family, his career and himself in the days leading up to the opening of his Broadway play.<br/><br/>Birdman is directed by newly Oscar winner Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and stars Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts and Emma Stone. This film deals with a multitude of theme: one existence, one place in real life, how you view your own life, duality, Critics, family life, drinking, special effects and blockbusters. Firstly, the way the movie was filmed surprised me: the film is made to look as if it's one continuous shot through clever editing techniques, really long takes and some very skilled actors to accomplish that. It feels like the opening shots of Goodfellas but for the entire movie which is a mind-blowing experience and kind of revolutionary. I can't even fathom how a movie can work like that. This aspect of the film makes us feel like we are behind the scene, on set with these people, it feels absolutely real. The score is very jazzy and feels unpredictable which is very similar to the movie itself. Michael Keaton plays Emma's Stone father, they have a difficult relationship. In fact, they all feel like they are pretending in real life and throughout the the movie Keaton character ears the voice of Birdman in his head telling him to do things; he also happens to have some mysterious power of some sort. This movie is WEIRD. Keaton character battle is a little bit like Dumbledore's saying ""You do what's right or you do what's easy."". Undeniably every character in this film is dealing with an intense psychological issue of some kind that makes them feel split as they're two halves for one whole. It touches also, on distance, what your place in the world is and what you're here for. The movie is filled with brilliant metaphorical imagery which install thoughts into your brain, explained afterwards through very good film making and excellent acting. I can't say it enough but actors are AMAZING. Michael Keaton pulls off the best performance of his entire career, Edward Norton is the best he's been in years and Emma Stone may be the best she's ever been. <br/><br/>Birdman approaches blockbuster movies, not in an insulting way, it questions our vision of this industry. However what hold the biggest impact on me is the way this film deals with Critics in general. In a scene Michael Keaton literally explodes and exposes in a monologue each and every problem film criticism knows nowadays. It's heaven! Indeed, film critics do not talk about film making anymore, they do not talk of a scene structure or shot composition, they are looking for a quote they can put on a DVD cover (yeah DVD because I'm old fashioned). I'm guilty of those things myself but it doesn't make his point less relevant to me. An other scene assault on audience members that don't care about anything but green screen and explosion sequences. I do absolutely love good action movies and some big fun entertainment movies but I also respect Art films that are trying to be just ART: a film that has so much thoughts provoking behind and so much to say about Humanity, relationships and also movie business in our society. It emphasises perfectly the conflict of Hollywood right now: Blockbusters Vs Indie Movies. If you are in a Blockbuster it doesn't mean you're a bad actor as well as if you are in a smaller production it doesn't mean you're a good actor. This is breaking the fourth wall and talking to all of us. Plus, the fact that they reference real Hollywood people such as Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Ryan Gosling or Jeremy Renner. Those references are things we actually know as entertainment, as Hollywood movies and actors. It makes it feel more real, like it is happening in our world.<br/><br/>Overall everyone was great in this film. I felt like I was part of it, I was there, it was unique and original. Birdman is one of those movie you're glad someone made it happened. We really do need more movie like this one! After this movie you are going to notice all the scenes changing and all the jump cuts involved in the editing process of a movie, EVERYTHING. It's going to drive you nuts!"

"PanamaVeggie","5","17","36","14 June 2015"," If you're on the fence, maybe you should skip this one. Here's why:
","I felt so blah about the movie that I gave it a 5/10 star rating and was going to click away. Then I got to thinking: I heard this film referred to as a masterpiece (which I don't dispute; to some people, it is). I just wish there'd been a review that answered the question: What kind of person likes Birdman?<br/><br/>So if you're on the fence about watching it, maybe this review can help. <br/><br/>Firstly, I love the actors in the film, so I was predisposed to like it. I saw Keaton get his due during the award season and my heart swelled for him...he came across as humble, and grateful, and moved. ""I want to watch that film,"" I said to myself. I missed it in theaters, so I waited for it to come back around.<br/><br/>Secondly, if you love Iñárritu flicks, you should stop reading and just watch the film. I have seen two of his previous films...loved one, hated the other. (Best if I don't get into that here.) <br/><br/>Whether or not you'll like Birdman may depend on what genres you typically favor: <br/><br/>I like fantasy, sci fi, action, adventure, romance, documentaries, pretty much anything that either makes me forget the world's troubles or makes me think, or inspires me...art that touches you, cinematography that makes viewing an experience, dialogue that keeps you glued to the set (or, in the absence of copious dialogue, writing that makes you look up the screenplay writer because man, that was a good premise and it was executed flawlessly).<br/><br/>I rarely choose straight up drama (though some of my favorite movies are dramas). I usually hate dramedies and about 50% of the artsy films I watch (art-house, film noire, you name it), because most of them come across as mere artifice. <br/><br/>And so did Birdman. <br/><br/>This movie had some serious hype: <br/><br/>""Oh cool. This film was shot in a totally different way! <br/><br/>""Oh man...it took two years to write. It MUST be good!""<br/><br/>""Michael Keaton can act! He is great, therefore the film is great!"" <br/><br/>None of that jives with me. Yes, Keaton can act. Everyone did their job in this film. But I just didn't care. The writing didn't take me anywhere. I am a huge movie fan and I can't imagine ever not finishing a film once I start watching. But with this one I struggled. It was painfully boring. Going nowhere. Devoid of emotion or true connections. Piles of nothing heaped upon nothing. <br/><br/>I kept pausing and making up little tasks for myself...paint the armoire (not kidding, I actually did paint a chest of drawers), feed the monsters (our pets), do the dishes (ok that last one, I didn't actually do, I just stared at them and sighed and went to finish the movie).<br/><br/>There was one moment, toward the end, that made me tear up, but the rest felt contrived. Trying so hard to be artsy, to be different, to rouse the (yawning) viewer with an unusual angle or a surprise action scene or a long lingering shot of a hallway. All at the expense of story, of giving the viewer an experience in exchange for her 95 minutes.<br/><br/>So let me be the one to say it: The Emperor has no clothes.<br/><br/>At best, Birdman is a great (very true) portrayal of an ""all about me"" type. The delusional man in your life--father, lover, whoever--that isn't a bad person, but will never change. Trying to talk to him is insane (argh! And yet sometimes you forget, and you try, and you always end up disappointed). Even if he shows signs of progress--teeny tiny ones, now and again--he always goes back to his selfish behavior. He will never be anything more than a martyr/big man. Keaton plays this man amazingly well."

I sat there through the 2 hrs, wondering how was this movie nominated at the Golden Globes, then I remembered it is nominated for the Oscars as well! Why? Just, why? That's all I have to say. I'm not the expert but this does not meet the standards of an 8.5 movie on IMDb, honestly, there was no point to it, I didn't feel anything watching it, granted Michael Keaton tried so, so much, but it didn't make up for the disaster this whole movie is. I have doubts now to watch the rest of the movies nominated for the Oscars and the Golden Globes.... I will recommend this to my friends, just for the fun of it :)"

","I watched this on DVD(thank God it wasn't on the big screen.), there were five of us and I didn't want to spoil it for the others so I sat there quietly trying not to smash the TV with a sledgehammer just to make that talent-less,smudge of an actor Keaton disappear.<br/><br/>Keaton is talent-less, you can easily come to that conclusion by just observing his fellow stars in the movie,look at Stone,Norton,Galifianakis.Watts etc whether you like them or not you can admit that they have studied their roles, watching the ""Spotlight"" and comparing him with Ruffalo makes it even easier. Keaton isn't acting he is just being himself and he cannot even get that right.. <br/><br/>Anyway this movie is a masterpiece because it was shot in one shot.. What? Ehh.. Why? Ehh.. Was this a first at the time? Of course not. Did it feel magical in any way? Absolutely not! Inarritu is a fantastic director I'll never forget that genius shot in the club,with the deaf girl on ""Babel"" but come on people just because he is a genius does not mean that everything he does is magic, ""Birdman"" is a joke .<br/><br/>The scenario,the script,the dialogue,the characters are all somewhat OK but just OK and nothing more. A washed out action star,has existential issues and manically tries to prove to the world that he is better than that by starring at theatrical play just like Keaton's real life,it's a movie about failed actors,critics and their inner demons . <br/><br/>Actually I have rated this with a four(4), for the efforts of Inarritu Norton Stone etc. but the script is so mediocre, Keaton so mind blowingly bad and the movie so unbelievably overrated that a four just won't ""cut"" it anymore, it's official then it's a three (3) from now on.."

","Some morbid curiosity made me watch this film to the end. In summary, I hated this film. I understand that it's considered a triumph in film art plus I'm a fan of the actors however the story is bland, depressing and sadly stupid. To me it was a mismatch of great actors acting out bad lines in a contrived environment. Don't waste your time people, the movie will leave you depressed. I wanted to stop watching so many times. The final gun shot to the head scene was totally amateur and I would have preferred him to succeed. The tone of the movie was mean and harsh and reflected the worst side of American culture with its relentless pressure to be the best. I don't understand why such polished actors would want to be associated with this crap."

","I cannot stress how utterly terrible this movie is. I asked for my money back, I should have sued the filmmaker. How this show could possibly be ""critically acclaimed"" is beyond me. If this is a window into the reality of producing a play then there are lots of people with meaningless lives who spend their days doing absolutely nothing of note other than ponder their own ""greatness"". I am sure there are plenty of people who will posit that the show is about ""something bigger"" that stupid people cannot understand, there are always those who think they are smarter than everyone. If the point was entertainment, it fails miserably. This show is stupid and not entertaining. The only show less entertaining than this is Inherent Vice. At least Birdemic was funny. The Room was far more entertaining than Birdman. Almost any commercial ever produced is more entertaining than Birdman.

"irimiciuc_s","10","10","19","11 January 2015"," Birdman unexpectedly amazing
","It is debatable the best movie of the year, at least it should take the Oscar for best picture. The movie follows the twilight moments of a action star actor which tries to make a comeback in the acting world( with a play that he wrote , directed, and stars in it). It can be seen from the beginning that he is a little crazy ( hearing the voice of the character that made him famous ). the denial of such madness combined with production problems ( high maintenance "" method"" actors)make for a great part for Keaton's character giving him humor and depth. The movie is dark, sad and it portraits the Hollywood vs theater dilemma.. the big budget movies vs small theater plays. The struggle of a successful Hollywood star to be accepted by the theater community as a ""real"" actor. this is only on the surface, deep down this is a family drama , presenting the sacrifices that Keaton's character made - neglecting his family for fame. I will not spoil the end but the suicide it can be seen coming from far away and it is a little bit disappointing but still, even the suicide scene is not about one killing self. It is about one not being able to live in a world that he cannot practice the one thing that he love the most ( acting). Thumbs up to Keaton, Stone, Norton and surprisingly Galifianakis. If this is not the best movie from all the possible for Oscar is at least top 3."
"joangreg","1","18","39","2 February 2015"," Exceptionally Bad
","I saw this movie AFTER it received the nine Academy Award nominations, expecting, at minimum, a film marginally enjoyable. What I viewed was a 2 hour long abomination. This monstrosity was obviously written by individuals whose sole purpose to ""push the buttons"" of the voting Academy elites that select the most notable films for the best picture, actor, etc So, let us digest their decisions: 1. Best Picture. Really? What made this so wonderful? The supposed, uninterrupted sequence of events? A gimmick, where anyone viewing this tripe could tell where one scene actually ended when the actor(s) walked into a dark area. Very much a ""one trick pony"" of awfulness. The sad part is, this thing might actually win. Remember how ""Shakespeare in Love"" won out over ""Saving Private Ryan""? 2. Best Actor. Michael Keaton. Yes; I must admit that Michael Keaton DOES deserve the nomination here. His performance is the only redeeming feature of this badness. 3. Best Supporting Actor: Edward Norton. Over the top, and a rather silly performance from an actor I actually admire. 4. Best Supporting Actress: Emma Stone. Why? This nomination makes no sense to me, because there are several in Hollywood who could have matched this performance; and, her minimal time on screen does not justify this! 5. Directing: Ah! The badness of this creation lends itself to why this nomination is unjustified. An example: When our main character is being followed by his alter ego. Notice that ""the birdman"" is actually shorter than the main character he represents! Bad! 6. Cinematography: Once again, why? The break movement from one scene to the next is easily spotted and forgettable from anyone paying attention. 7. Sound Editing: Perhaps the most hideous of all the nominations! I cannot tell you how irritating the ""sound"" in this movie was, mainly regarding the background noise of a street drummer banging away. Please, please do not put yourself through this! 8. Sound Mixing: Ditto! I actually developed a headache before the end of the film. 9. Writing Original Screenplay: Four individuals apparently conspired to create this ""masterpiece"". Their intentions were not towards any audience that would view it. They knew that it would appeal to the Academy elite, who would acclaim the film as a wonderful achievement, disregarding what, in truth, makes a great film. They would like to make us think their product is bold and original, but it is anything but. The characters are stereotypical; the plot is predictable and unoriginal (both my wife and I knew the ending half way through the film). Throw in some Psychobabble nonsense, and there you have it. No one will discuss this film a few years from now, and I believe anyone involved with its creation will deny their involvement. Come on! The ""truth or dare"" sequences alone should make anyone cringe, and fans of ""The Walking Dead"" know where these so-called writers originally got this idea. Insipid, and puerile! If you would really like to see a film based on a self-destructive character, go back in time and see ""All That Jazz"", starring Roy Scheider. Not my favorite, but memorable. Better yet, see Marlon Brando in ""Burn!"", or Peter Finch in ""The Red Tent"". Or, go back even further and enjoy Humphrey Bogart in ""The Caine Mutiny"". Now, that is acting with a memorable story!"

","Let me start by acknowledging that I have a bias against hand-held cinematography. When it is appropriate (e.g., during the beach landing scene in Saving Private Ryan, or close-up struggle like scenes from the Bourne movies), I have no problem at all. But this... About 30 minutes in, I decided that Birdman was too self-indulgent to be worth my time and left to do other things. Whatever story there was lay obfuscated behind tediously long (and unnecessary) tracking shots down hallways and staircases that seemed to have no other purpose than vent the director's ego. (""Hey, viewer, do you see what I'm doing here? Pretty impressive, huh? Look, you'd expect it to end here, but no, I've found a way to keep it going way past where Hitchcock and Welles would have stopped. Aren't you impressed?

"c_a_o","10","12","24","24 March 2015"," An Instant Classic: The Best Film of the 21st Century
","Instead of including an accompanying review, I will instead be providing my analysis of the film's ending, going so far as to explain it's relevance in being named the best film of the 21st century.<br/><br/>The following analysis of the ending of Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a look into how this amalgamation of deep symbolism and cinematic excellence make the ending of this film arguably one of the most profound in cinematic history, and a perfect ending to Iñárritu's masterpiece. <br/><br/>""To begin, the sudden take essentially provides a clear look towards the fact that Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) has indeed perished. The reason for this ending being so ambiguous to everyone is of great concern and confusion to myself; Iñárritu's description of life as ""one full take"" alludes to how Riggan has died, and the following hospital scene is a depiction of Riggan's ""heaven"", or paradise, a world in which he is free of the struggles of fatherhood, acting, and most importantly. the alluring, pressuring presence of his former self, Birdman. This is portrayed through the symbolic revealing of Riggan's face after taking off his medical mask, revealing a nose that aligns perfectly with that of the Birdman costume; sure enough, as Riggan steps out of the bathroom, Birdman's ""goodbye"" confirms what Riggan wants in his ideal world - to be free of this tantalizing identity. <br/><br/>Other symbolism in this iconic scene is the magazine, which Jake (Zach Galifinakis) provides to Riggan in his hospital bed, the title of which is 'The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance', referring to the Raymond Carver-based play and Riggan's success. However, as we saw before, the critic Tabitha rushed out of the theater in what appeared to be contempt at the moment at which he kills himself, leading the viewer to believe that her suspicions regarding the play have been confirmed and that she is on her way to ""kill the play"" in a review, as was aforementioned. This positive review is once again a figment of Riggan's idealist dream, a want or lust for a positive review, to feel accomplished or fulfilled in his pursuit of ""true art"". <br/><br/>Minor symbolism in this scene includes the introduction to the scene, as during the transition a deserted beach is shown with birds flying away from dead jellyfish, symbolizing Riggan's true freedom from this identity, something which could only be accomplished through death. The press rushing into the hospital and his ex-wife's intimate embrace are all culminations of his wants, as these would not be attainable in reality. <br/><br/>Riggan's daughter Sam (Emma Stone) provides the paramount, overwhelming icing-on-the-cake to this profound film, as her entrance to the hospital room is one of the final events of the film. Her iconic view out of the hospital window (Which don't open, once again a figment of Riggan's imagination), provide an encapsulating finish to Riggan's idealist world, a world in which his daughter, and ultimately all of society (Symbolized by the media in the hospital) look up and remember him, finally making him relevant and proved by Sam's admiring look up to the sky where Riggan is finally free of cynical societal restraints.""<br/><br/>To explain to some who may seem confused by the director's intentions with this ambiguous ending:<br/><br/>""If you look into the intricate details of the film, or ""silver linings"", you see what Innaritu tried to project - a man, delusional and suffering, somber regarding the intertwined nature of aging and relevance. Riggan thus seeks to escape this reality, this unfortunate truth, and finally reaches his ideal world through death. Also, I'd have to differ in terms of your analysis of Sam's reaction at the end. We see the complicated, difficult father- daughter relationship throughout the film between Riggan and Sam, and Riggan's anxiety regarding how he'll be remembered (Recall the plane incident with George Clooney that Riggan tells his ex-wife), and thus it makes sense that in his ideal world Sam would look up to him in admiration, as was implied in the final, hospital-window scene.""<br/><br/>Thank you for reading this analysis and I hoped I allowed you to grasp a better understanding of this 'instant classic'."

","First let me say that I realize all move criticism is subjective, and after reading about 80 pages of reviews on this website, it is clear that most either loved or hated this film. For me and my lady friend, both seniors, who rarely go see the mass-audience films anymore, this was a big disappointment. Like many films lauded by the critics, this one has a script containing about 200 f-bombs, an unusual gimmick (this film appears to be one continuous scene-no breaks), some surreal scenes intermixed to make the viewer have to decipher what is real and what is in the actors head, and a lot of mental pain and depression. We have been seeing about 3 or 4 films a month for over 20 years, and this was the first one that ever put my lady friend to sleep. I stayed awake hoping to see something that made me care about the characters, but it never came. Some people say ""Crash"" was undeserving of the Oscar, but compared to this, it was a masterpiece. In my opinion this is the least deserving best picture winner ever, including the literal sleeper ""The English Patient"". My solace in all this is that 25% of those who reviewed this gave it a 1 or 2 star rating. Most films receive less than 5%. There will be those who say I just didn't get the brilliance and try to insult my intelligence. But the poor box-office and and the high % of critical reviews make me realize I am not being unfair to this film. Huge waste of time. I'll Take ""Whiplash"", ""The Theory of Everything"", ""American Sniper"", and ""The Imitation Game"" as 4 films far more worthier than ""Birdman"", and all much more entertaining."

I don't think I would like others to follow, since the camera moves were sometimes distracting, but it's nice for a change.

I suppose the aim was to create an ambitious piece of cinema, steeped in humor and irony, with plenty of material for the star cast to show off their dramatic chops. All actors are trying really hard, not the least Keaton. Try as they might they can't salvage the disjointed script, that is simply a poorly stitched mash up of mediocre and tired dialogue that we have heard many times before: Long winded monologues on the meaning of art?

"Bully_FU","4","13","27","13 February 2015"," A lot of wasted potential...
","I had semi-high hopes for Birdman when I initially saw the trailers. I didn't expect it to be a full blown comedy, drama, or action movie. I thought it might fall into the same sort of genre as ""The Wrestler"", a character driven film that has some elements of humor, maybe small action sequences, but primarily focus on the main character's current life. I also anticipated it having a dark sort of tone overall, like a dark comedy of sorts maybe like ""Super"". By the time I finally got to see it almost all of the award nominations it received were announced combined with the new ad campaign touting those nominations with all the critical praise. I tried to ignore most of that so I didn't let my expectations get too high, with all the recognition and praise it could only disappoint. It ended up succeeding at disappointing me so either I failed to ignore the praise or it was made for critics.<br/><br/>Although it doesn't ruin any plot points, the film was edited and shot as if it was one long continuous take. I found this out maybe 2-3 days before I saw the film and thought that was odd because I didn't see how that would fit the story or benefit it in any way. Hearing that made me real hesitant because if used poorly I thought it would damage the film as a whole instead of enhancing it. After finishing the film I realized I was right to be hesitant about that style. It hurt the film much more than I even thought possible. It made it seem cheap, corny, and gimmicky like it was pandering to critics instead of adding depth or perspective extra to the story. I typically enjoy long shots/takes in movies or TV shows. The major benefit to long tracking shots is they capture everything in real time and if used effectively it helps immerse you into the story as more of a passenger than just a bystander or spectator. I've seen it used effectively in almost every genre, be it dramas, comedies, or action. I believe I've only seen 2 films that used it the entire way through but I've seen it used many times for a 10-20 minute scene. In Birdman it was used all the way to the end and it wasn't used to convey real time or to highlight or enhance anything specifically. It was a little confusing because they used that style but also condensed at least 3-4 days into about 2 hours. I assume the purpose of that style being used was to convey the ""theater"" feel, in which everything is done live in one take without edits or retakes but if that was the intent then it could have been achieved differently. Perhaps using a few long takes instead of dragging it out the entire film. The transitions in scenes while the camera followed someone through hallways or staircases were completely unnecessary. They didn't contain one thing of substance in which made them necessary or important in telling the story, so they achieved only in continuing the ""1 continuous take"" gimmick. It ended up feeling forced as well as confusing and distracting which hurt the film as a whole by making it appear rushed and cheap. <br/><br/>The story was about what I anticipated with no real surprises, which wasn't a bad thing. It was decent and had potential to be really good, I thought. If it was edited like a normal movie it would have been better. I doubt they'd release a different cut of the film on Blu-Ray or DVD considering all the critical praise it received as it is, in addition to award nominations. The only way I'd be interested in seeing it again though would be if they released a version with clear editing to make it appear more like your average film. It could be edited into a few long takes, having each scene stand alone without the pointless transitions. Outside of that sort of cut though I have no desire to watch it again. I gave it 4 out of 10 stars on here because like I said the story had potential and delivered on some of that of potential although it could have been executed better. I give what I consider ""average"" movies 5 out 10 stars, I'd say this is slightly below average or just OK. What earned those 4 starts primarily were the performances by the cast. Everyone in the cast was excellent and they deserve the recognition and praise from fans and critics alike. Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough, and Amy Ryan were all excellent in their roles. I don't typically care for either Zach Galifianakis or Emma Stone however they both executed their parts surprisingly well and showed me they are better performers than their typical big Hollywood roles would indicate. Michael Keaton was fantastic and delivered his best performance in decades. I don't think any other actor could have carried that role as well as he did. His performance was the main reason I wanted to see the movie in the first place and in that aspect he didn't disappoint. Hopefully this will opens doors for him to receive better roles moving forward because he hasn't had a chance to really carry a movie in decades, although he definitely has the talent to. <br/><br/>If this is a movie you've been looking forward to and have been anxious to see I'd suggest lowering your expectations before watching it and maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did. If you only want to see this because all of the critical praise and award nominations then I believe you're wasting your time and should just pass as it will most likely disappoint you. If you want to see great actors give great performances and see how poor editing can ruin the final product then I can't think of a better movie to watch."

","Apart from the ludicrous plot, boring sequences, etc. that other reviewers have castigated, I don't believe that even Americans speak with every tenth word the f**** word. No one speaks or behaves towards others like this. It's totally unnecessary and really offensive to many people, including me. I think it's done merely to appear 'modern' or 'realistic'. In the context of the total lack of realism in the film itself the language is purposeless and self-indulgent. Unfortunately, many films these days seem to be following the same trend. About the only film I've seen recently without the f**** word is Exodus - the one film in which you feel it might be justified! Surely the actors, writers, producers and directors of films don't speak like this to their family, friends and colleagues in real life. Lord help us if they do! Anyway, it just adds to the awfulness of this particular film."

","Still hard to believe this film received an Academy Award for best script. It looks more to have been written by 4 very green high school students inexperienced in life or the art of writing. They seem to have spent a lot of their time sitting around calling up favorite movie tropes & clichés. These somehow got misinterpreted as Magic Realism by a gullible press assisted along no doubt by a prominent product placement of Borges' Labyrinth in Ed Norton's hand in one of many stagy scenes. <br/><br/>Also in evidence as teenage over-enthusiasm is an excessive amount of misogyny. The women in this film come off as conniving, manipulative, neurotic & self-obsessed in the extreme with Emma Stone as the new Martha Plimpton. I wonder if Lindsay Duncan was aware before signing on of the grotesquely abusive & wholly gratuitous verbal intro her character received in the bar scene. The male characters fare somewhat better only because their humiliation comes in having to appear semi-nude, easily laughed off in macho culture. <br/><br/>Actually I think what Inarittu & his band have pulled off is to deliberately make a shallow pretentious pseudo-Indy film satirizing their counterparts of the north to which a major part of Jollywood elite have bought in whole hog."

","Just watched Birdman last night...I love the feeling of coming out of the theater without having all the answers and discussing with your companion how they interpreted it! This movie has multiple layers and you were invited to peel off the onion in a fluid cinematography that adds value to the overall story. Lubezki applies the concept of ""camera always running"" to add realism and to make the audience part of the movie. Amazing how a 2 hour long movie which is shot basically all inside a theater, is able to capture everyone's attention without getting dull, due to genius acting, directing and the relentless camera-work. Keaton, perfect for the role, given his history with superhero and being forgotten for so many years, delivers a visceral interpretation without worrying about his image, with pure focus on the character. Norton is at his best- the rehearsal scene with Keaton is amazing, and so is his dialogs with Stone. A movie that criticizes mainstream cinema, and will make you reflect about choices, about family, career, and love. The end is left open for interpretation. Without spoiling it, in my opinion it is part of the main character's delusion and how he wants to be admired. After all, what do we say when we talk about love?"

"tenshi_ippikiookami","6","5","8","31 December 2015"," More than amazing acting for an story seen hundred times
","That ""Birdman"" is a self-conscious movie, that thinks too high of itself and that doesn't care is obvious from the moment it starts. For sure, it looks beautiful, and the actors do an amazing job, but this doesn't change the fact that the movie is looking at itself the whole time and saying: I'm great.<br/><br/>The story doesn't really matter. Washed-up actor Riggan (a Michael Keaton that eats the screen and keeps the movie going even in its low points) decides to put a Broadway play where he will be director, actor and adapt an story by Raymond Carver. That's all an excuse for cool camera work, meta-dialogues, tongue-in-cheek situations and the same story of actor that wants to give himself a last chance, that left his family for his work, that is known by a blockbuster but not recognized by his acting... It has to be said that all the actors more than deliver, because behind Michael Keaton's center piece, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis (more toned down than usually, which is an improvement) or Naomi Watts do an excellent job. Iñárritu's work with scenery is very good too, showy but assured.<br/><br/>But that the movie knows that it's playing with the convention doesn't save from itself patting its own back constantly, with even some unnecessary shots at blockbusters, plastic surgery, etc... You don't have to tell that you are great if you are really great.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it is a movie really worth watching, even if it is just to see Michael Keaton's astonishing interpretation."
"rmax304823","6","5","8","13 November 2015"," A Chaffering, Most Farraginous Chronicle.
","I'm giving this a rating of six because I don't know what else to do. It's a complex congeries of ambition and dramatic, innovative whimsy.<br/><br/>It's difficult to see how ""Birdman"" could possibly become a popular success. The ordinary Hollywood movie has come to the point where its intended audience has a physical age of about fifteen and a mental age buried somewhere farther back in childhood. And this is challenging, more like literature than film.<br/><br/>The story itself, as far as it can be discerned through all the fantasy, has Michael Keaton, ex hero of the Birdman movies, and my former supporting player in the magnificent, ""The Squeeze,"" now directing a Broadway play, ""What People Talk About When They Talk About Love."" That title might have been too much even for Ingmar Bergman. The rehearsals involve performers like Naomi Watts and the egomaniacal Edward Norton. It's shaping up to be a disaster. <br/><br/>But on opening night, everything appears to turn out for the best, and at the climax, for added frisson, Keaton shoots part of his nose off with a real bullet. His hospital room is now filled with flowers. The play is a great success. His wrangles with his ex wife and daughter are now resolved. He's put ""the voices"" behind him. He's happy as a clam so he jumps out the window.<br/><br/>Keaton does fine by the role of the hallucinating and suicidal director, and everyone else measures up. There's no problem with any of the performances. But, man, this is one heavy duty drama. There's not a giggle in it, not a light moment, no beauty. It may borrow its technique from ""All That Jazz"" but it's message is strictly from Willie Loman.<br/><br/>You see, whenever Keaton is alone, he's at least free of having to argue with someone or slam somebody up against a wall, but he suffers first from deep-throated voices accusing him of being a phony and so forth. And then the source of the voice appears. It's his former role as Birdman, in the typical panoply of the Action Hero, but with black wings. The figure begins to follow him around the streets of New York, snarling at him behind his back.<br/><br/>If you have never seen a Steadycam in use, watch this film because that's about all you'll see. The camera follows, or sometimes precedes, characters as they stalk down long corridors and around corners and up stairs and through doorways. Nothing can stop it. During static scenes, the director displays his fondness for wide angle lenses that turn human faces into those of porpoises.<br/><br/>It's a little annoying to mix up hallucinations and fantasies with what's actually going on in the behavior stream. The first time I recall a serious use of the device was in ""I Never Promised You A Rose Garden."" Okay. The hallucinated figures were visible on the screen but we could still tell they weren't real. Then came ""A Brilliant Mind,"" far too much of a good thing.<br/><br/>And here we have Keaton committing suicide -- I don't know how many times -- before he takes the final fateful leap from the hospital window. When his daughter rushes to the window and sees his smashed body down on the street, she looks up at the sky and smiles. (No, I don't either.) Unless -- unless -- can it be? There IS no road kill below? We don't get to see it. And -- and maybe Keaton really DID take off into the sky like Birdman. In a movie where anything is possible, anything is possible.<br/><br/>I leave the judgment to the viewer, blanks, subtitle, and all. You probably won't soon forget it."

They only sleep with everyone else. They sleep with their friend's wife, their friend's daughter their friend's son! Gee I did not know that, so luckily there are movies to tell the sad defecating back story behind all theater and movie productions. There has to be some redeeming value to these characters or why do we idolize them? Perhaps we are all just lost in the murky sleazy world and love that there are no stars with redeeming values.<br/><br/>Seems to me there are many great stars with great happy stories and I love to hear them. I also love the steamy sleazy back stories too then they are well told and cohesive. Everyone in this is brilliant – to bad the story is ""Lost in Space"".<br/><br/>There have been some legendary stories about the back stage shenanigans at a play - Noises Off (example)! But Birdman is a meandering confusing story that lacks, well, comprehension. Sometimes great stars waste their time on an artsy film.

It shouldn't be my fault though, should it? The superpowers in super-realistic environment, the everlasting shots, yeah, that's a first (kind of), but where's the story? I thoroughly enjoyed Edward Norton's performance though, he's a good actor and plays the weirdo really well. But...Meh... At the same time, I stopped watching at 55 minutes I think.

","Warning, may contain SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying this movie had huge publicity and a certain style attached to it. Just by glancing at the poster I felt a certain air of Pulp Fiction and The Big Lebowski. It felt good, and I was all to happy to see it on DVD. But my mania didn't last for long.<br/><br/>The next thing that is easily noticeable is the star-studded line-up of this movie; Keaton, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts to name a few. I'm a fan of all these actors and again, I was glad to see all of them on the same set. But, as it has been proved time and time again, having an all-star roster of actors doesn't result in a good movie(some exceptions).<br/><br/>But then, it all goes downhill. After about 40 or so minutes into the movie, I'm left wondering what's this movie really about. There is little to none meaningful character interaction. Sometimes, characters will talk to one another about their past without any insight into the present, or to deepen a bond. Mostly random stuff, just so you can hear their voices. Next we go to the soundtrack of this movie; again, mostly random noises here and there(it has kind of a fetish with that badum-tsss drum-sound). At one point into Birdman's delusions he sees a drummer randomly doing his thing in the backstage. I just can't help but feel this movie was made at random, just to glorify an imagery and style somewhat similar to Rope, in that it gives you a slight impression the action is continuous and uninterrupted. I don't know how this can be praised as the best movie of 2014 when clearly it's the product of a bored Director and some investor with too much money in their pocket.<br/><br/>I'll give 3/10 starts to this just because Edward Norton plays himself in a way, with all the rumors going around that he is a very difficult actor to work with."

I like all of the actors in it and they did well considering they were acting in a film with no real plot. Big disappointment and a waste of good talent.

","I sat down with great anticipation about the movie, I really did! In the end I just decided it was more or less a waste of my time. Not everything was that bad though. I really liked the photography and direction of the movie. Some of the shots were really really nice but overall I was left with a feeling of dizziness from all the weird angles. The storyline was OK but nothing special I would say. The acting from Keaton was exemplary as was the one from Norton and Galifianakis, but they alone could not save a movie that was (a) script less and (b) all over the place during most of the film. <br/><br/>I did not appreciate the constant noise from drums and other instruments and I definitely did not like all this constant confusion. I liked the effect with the special powers and they way in which the director handled the taxi scene where you understand that he's just a man after all. I did not care for the mixed up ending as well. From my point of view, I think that what happened after the gun shot, was in his mind for this brief moment before he passed away. He did not shoot his nose from point blank and he did not miraculously lived from that! He can't have. <br/><br/>This is a nice finding as well but we could do with a more concrete proof that indeed that's the ending. Having his daughter looking low and then high in the air and seeing him fly or not. No, that's just something I don't care about. I like my movies to end in the end and not go online and search about it, thank you very much. <br/><br/>I did not like all the emphasis on the movie critic. She actually pushed him to suicide, doing nothing more in the movie, sitting there and drinking in the same bar, actually having 4-5 lines. What's that about? Is it to blame it on the theater critics in general? Is this a statement? I think not. As for Keaton, he is also a really fragile and strong character at the same time, with no will to live, hanging, barely on his own breath, trying to survive minute by minute. He has depicted really well his character, indeed, but it's the character himself that I did not like. What's he about? He's miserable and pathetic and then a theater critic pushes him over the edge and he just kills himself... Really? In general, all the characters were depicted on a superficial level (someone would expect the opposite them being actors and all) not allowing the viewer to relate or merely to understand their actions and pick sides. <br/><br/>Having watched all the other Oscar nominated actors and movies, Birdman was a true disappointment of a movie. The only thing that saves the day is the performance of Keaton, even playing a character not worthy of much."

The most annoying thing is you cant even sleep through the whole movie because the constant white noise in the background will just wake you up. <br/><br/>It should come with a health warning because you will literally walk away with a migraine from the constant repetitive terrible drumming and ringing of a telephone it literally keeps playing in the background throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Never mind water boarding or other torture techniques play this movie in guantanamo bay and you will break everyone. <br/><br/>In summary you will never get back the 2 hours you will waste on this movie."

"sportello29","9","12","25","28 February 2015"," What do we talk about when we talk about filmmaking?
","Birdman or the unexpected virtue of ignorance is this year's film of the year. A remarkable deep satire on modern Hollywood shot and panned out so brilliantly it leaves one shocked and stunned with emotions long after the credits start running.<br/><br/>Genuinely and passionately portrayed by M. Keaton, Birdman follows up a once-famous-now- washed-up movie star (Riggan Thomspon) who is trying to revamp himself by directing, writing and acting in his own adaptation of a love story. Riggan, just like all of us to an extent, has a big ego, which is portrayed as a physical character in birdman, a representation of something that Riggan was never able to let go. He misses the fame, the power, the fans; his desire is to be on the top again. After all, we would all love to fly across Times Square, high above everyone else. And this is all a part of a great, hilarious and clever sarcastic joke that Inarritu allows us to see. <br/><br/>Every major character in the movie is a satire on Hollywood and it's ways. From the co-actresses starring in the play (brilliantly portrayed by Naomi watts and Andrea Riseborough) who only desire to make it and get recognized, Riggan's agent who only cares about the public outcome rather then the one of his best friend, the critic that puts her own emotions and thoughts above everything else, audiences reactions when Riggan actually shoots himself on stage, to finally Riggan himself, who can't stay true to the twitter-and-facebook era and simply dreams of making it big again, despite all the difficulties and the sheere absurdity of doing something as blunt as his own theater production.<br/><br/>Yet on the side of this all, Riggan's wife is the most sensible of it all, and maybe the only thing Riggan has in his life that is true, real. She loves him for who he is and seemed to adjust to his ever growing ego, but you can clearly see how she despises it all, everything to do with this industry and it's pretentious people. And we see this echoed in their conversation just before the final scene, where Riggan can finally be honest enough to say that he regrets it all, not being with his family enough for the most part. Yet was is still so striking and inspiring about Riggan is his inability to give up, no matter what obstacles come his way, he has managed to put them aside in various ignorant (remortgaging his house that was meant to be for Sam) and hilarious (dropping a light bulb on an actor he didn't like) ways. <br/><br/>Mike is another character that adds so much needed diversity and angle to this film. He is a complete opposite of Riggan, he couldn't care less about the critics or what people think of him, as opposed to Riggan, he can only be himself on stage, he can't get it up with women and seems like a self-absorbent and ignorant character. His ego clashes with Riggan's, but Mike's ""Birdman"" isn't quite the same as Riggan's – he seems genuinely happy with what he has achieved and most importantly he is confident in everything he does, the exact opposite of Riggan himself. This provides a superb contrast into two completely different yet very similar people.<br/><br/>Everything is amplified even more with an amazingly original drums-only soundtrack that is so emotionally powerful it almost takes your breath away. Adding an even more original one-shot directing style makes this movie really stand out. It is a daring and honest experiment that in my opinion is a trillion times harder to pull off then something like boyhood.<br/><br/>The controversial ending simply represents the transformation of Riggan from Birdman to his stage character, who kills himself in the end. On the last scene we see Birdman, however this is the first time when he is not talking to Keaton, finally birdman's time has come and Riggan is able to move on by flying and exploring uncharted territories of his own. He was finally able to let go of Birdman.<br/><br/>What are we doing here? – is the question asked by Michael (Ed Norton) to Sam (Emma Stone) at one point in the movie, which might just be the subtle sense of it all."

After all the accolades, I decided to catch this little gem on cable and found out that the disgruntled comments were more accurate than the accolades showered from elites.<br/><br/>Birdman (subtitled The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance because it just sounds so fancy) is the meandering tale of Riggan, a former star of a blockbuster superhero film franchise now a wash-out (played by former Batman Michael Keaton, cue the irony), who is making a desperate stab to prove his acting bona fides and relevancy on the Great White Way in a new play. Naturally, nothing goes the way it should resulting in what appears to be a grandiose mental breakdown. Obstacles and complications include Riggan's ex-wife Amy Ryan, unpredictable Method actor co-star Edward Norton, Riggan's obnoxious lawyer/manager Zach Galifianakis, needy actress Naomi Watts, Riggan's burnt-out daughter cum assistant Emma Stone and vitriolic critic Lindsay Duncan, who is determined to destroy Riggan and the show...apparently just because she can.<br/><br/>Birdman is the kind of bilge that film critics, intellectuals and industry insiders salivate over because it so lovingly panders to them by insisting that only they know quality entertainment and everyone else are too mentally stunted to get it. It proclaims that it is talking about deep emotional issues and things of great import, but it is truthfully narcissitically in awe of its own self-importance. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu may be an artist, but his film is a disjointed, long-winded overacted mess that wants to cast barbs at viewers of popular mainstream films while coddling the art house crowd. It has nothing new or fresh to say, and not for one moment are we allowed to forget that we are watching a film-a VERY IMPORTANT film. A film bloated with its own self-aggrandizement and ludicrous flights of fancy. It tries so hard to sell the viewer on how brilliant it is that I thought someone may have left an Oscar voting ballot under my seated ass.<br/><br/>Much like we are never allowed to forget we are watching a film and thus are held at arms length from these bizarre characters, we are equally never allowed to forget that we are witnessing actors acting. Or perhaps I should clarify, we are watching ACTING!!! Every performance is rife with hostility and melodrama and pathos. They are pitched to the rafters and the scenery trembles in terror as it is chewed like a pack of piranhas has been loosed. The fact that Norton and Stone actually manage some fine moments is astounding. Everyone else blends into the acting cacophony until it becomes an indiscernible wall of noise.<br/><br/>No one more so than acclaimed lead actor Keaton. Keaton has worked precious little since his departure from the Batman series and when he has shown up it has been to mixed results. There is an irony of casting him in this role, but little more. Here he screams, he cries, he froths, he babbles, he runs around in his undies, he careens under the power of his own ego from one scene of hysterical overacting to the next. The fact that Inarritu stocks the film with seemingly endless internal fantasy sequences makes it even worse. Note to Keaton and the writers of this mess, Christian Bale was able to be the most memorable on screen Batman, while still doing Oscar-caliber prestige films and winning one himself. Stop blaming bad film choices and uneven performances on franchises and start looking inward.<br/><br/>The film itself takes punches at popular culture, the Hollywood system and the low prurient tastes of the masses, but is itself ultimately even more tiresome and vacuous than the entertainment it disdains because it comes packaged in such a thick carapace of deluded pretension. It plays like a really bad vanity piece. Even worse, it witlessly slogs past several endings and keeps going becoming more asinine by the frame. By the time Keaton takes a firearm and tries to commit suicide onstage one hopes it will be over, but then it goes onward to yet an even more tedious ambiguous ending that it hopes will inspire people to fervently discuss what actually happened and what did Emma Stone see out the window at the end. Unfortunately, more will probably be content to leave such discussion in the theater and escape from these endlessly yammering characters and the foolish film they inhabit, than debate what intentions the self-impressed screenplay had in its final moments.<br/><br/>A virtual cinematic definition of the emperor wearing no clothes."

","""Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige."" Mike (Edward Norton)<br/><br/>Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is important to see if only for Michael Keaton in the titular role, a has-been movie hero (Birdman) hoping to make a comeback as director, writer, and actor in his Broadway adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story. Keaton will be nominated for an Oscar; he's that good.<br/><br/>The film is also a witty commentary on celebrity (as the above quote attests), its tragic consequences when success does not follow success. In addition, collegial relationships are explored during the high-strung rehearsal of gifted actors at the St. James Theater on Broadway, challenging each other in professional and personal ways. <br/><br/>No fellow actor is tougher or brighter than Edward Norton as Mike, whose thespian gifts are generously displayed but who is sexually impotent off stage. When he works on stage with Keaton and Naomi Watts, the acting is better ensemble work than in any other film I can think of this year.<br/><br/>Besides the stunning acting, the camera and editing are to be experienced: the careering camera visits dressing rooms, hallways, and stage without skipping a beat--the director is extending takes and cutting minimally, letting the camera do the work while scenes follow scenes seamlessly. The effect is the high-energy of creative people bursting the confines of narrow backstage to emerge in the seemingly endless space of the stage, an expanse waiting for the egos and talents to fill it.<br/><br/>It's all about acting, and it is not always pretty: <br/><br/>""I wish I had more self-respect."" Lesley (Naomi Watts) ""You're an actress."" Laura (Andrea Riseborough)<br/><br/>However, it's Keaton's acting that dominates: edgy and impatient, on the lookout for the right nuance, diffident and dreaming--he's an artistic mess. Along with some gritty realism comes a modicum of magic realism such as telekinesis and flying, both not so weird given the creative energy that seems to come out of the walls."
"mmaggiano","9","18","41","6 November 2014"," Highly skilled, challenging, and full of brains and heart
","The film's technical merits are without exception. Most predominant is that the whole movie feels like one long sequence shot, from about minute 2 until nearly the end. There are disguised cuts, and the movie finds moments to settle down the camera to contrast the movement. But the orchestration of actors, the re-framing of the camera, and the support of crew outside the frame, are nothing short of phenomenal.<br/><br/>The film's artistic merits are easy to see in the performances, design and composition, but harder to puzzle out emotionally/intellectually. They rely partly on multiple ambiguities, and the audience will need to do some broad-view thinking about life and art to really crack open the movie. For all of this, I would not say that the merits are so rarified that they should push away anyone who wants to see a challenging movie. They are hard to crack, but not because you really have to understand all the references."

"jrwygant","1","15","33","23 March 2015"," good acting, nice camera work, lousy story
","I need to say that no specific plot details are revealed in this review, but some general observations suggest some plot points. If you haven't seen this movie, this review might spoil it for you, but I'm not recommending that you do see it.<br/><br/>Birdman is an unfortunate mix. I'm a fan of Michael Keaton, so I came to this film with a bit of a bias in his favor. I am pleased to say that I thought his acting was superb. Also, the camera work was interesting, though not original. The continuously moving camera coupled with creative editing and CG work gave the impression of one continuous shot. That also suggested a degree of reality -- seeing events as they happened -- which ultimately was not supported by the story. This movie fails completely in its inability to present itself either as reality or as fantasy. It also fails by creating a protagonist who serves no apparent purpose in the story except to cause us to feel sorry for him.<br/><br/>Keaton plays a former actor in super hero movies who is despondent about becoming too old to maintain that role, which apparently has become indistinguishable from his self-image. While despondence is a great dramatic hook, we usually expect a good story to present us with despair that arises over something that would matter to most of us, for instance a runner who loses the use of his legs, an architect who goes blind, an employee who gets fired. It's troubling that many viewers can identify with a man whose despair arises from his self-image as an aging super hero. While we don't usually hold films to the standards of the best classical dramas, those Greek and Shakespearean plays set some guidelines that have worked for centuries now in providing solid entertainment. Those guidelines are nowhere evident in Birdman.<br/><br/>Although we see traces of fantasy throughout the film in Keaton's delusions, we are led to believe they are simply his personal hallucinations, particularly since no one else ever sees them. That casts the film in the role of a reality tale. However, in the final few minutes we are presented with a fantasy scene that is witnessed by someone else, suggesting that we have been duped and that the reality of all that preceded those final moments is in question. That's not good story telling; it's only confusion and audience manipulation.<br/><br/>This film contains two major gimmicks that were clearly intended to let some viewers think they were seeing something smart and clever, while actually they were only experiencing dishonest writing. Norman Rockwell once said if a magazine cover he was painting wasn't working, he'd add a dog. If it still wasn't working he'd put a bandage on the dog's foot. Here we got the dog and the bandage. One of those gimmicks is the ending described above. The other preceded it and involved Keaton doing something while on stage that served no useful purpose in the story except to provide some suspense, until the inevitable moment finally arrived.<br/><br/>I have no argument with morality plays and with pure fantasy. Maleficent is a recent example. That story used fantasy to convey some views about human relationships. There was no confusion between fantasy and reality, and the story was driven by a need to resolve a wrong, a resolution which occurred predictably but in a satisfying manner at the end. Birdman doesn't even come close."
"KimarieSings","3","13","28","11 April 2015"," I really wanted to LOVE this movie!!!
","I have been a huge Michael Keaton fan since first seeing him on the sitcom ""Working Stiffs"" with Jim Belushi back in the 80's, and have closely followed his career ever since. I had seen the trailer for this movie when I had seen ""Whiplash"" (9/10) and thought the premise was interesting as it seemed to parody/parallel his career and his iconic portrayal of ""Batman"". *Sigh* I was thoroughly disappointed.<br/><br/>The 3 stars I have given are for the individual performances themselves. Each character was well portrayed and interesting--especially Ed Norton, however the screenplay was SO lacking that NONE of the characters developed any depth beyond a rough sketch, which was very disappointing because I really wanted to know more about them! <br/><br/>The whole story is so disjointed, it really seems like the whole movie was put together around the whole ""let the audience decide what is real and what is fantasy"" premise, which in this case seems completely contrived and a total cop- out. <br/><br/>I was just left feeling as if this movie set out from the start to be this ""award winning movie that makes you think"", but it was done in such a heavy handed obvious way, that I almost felt insulted. I was really surprised that so many intelligent people fell for the ploy. IMO, the ending was ridiculous and the best example of my point.<br/><br/>In summation: Actors=Yey Story=Nay"
"GregForstner","3","13","28","17 February 2015"," One of the biggest disappointments I've ever had with movies
","I saw the trailer and I liked it, I read reviews replete with accolades, I noticed that the movie was nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories. So I thought that I couldn't go wrong with this one. But what I got was an irritatingly wordy play-in-a-movie that confuses humor with hysteric outbreaks. Of the latter you'll find more than enough in this flick. OK, there were scenes that provided some enjoyment such as when the Michael Keaton character is running naked on Broadway and then has to improvise his way back into the play. Or the shrewd dialog between him and the critic. But these witty and lighthearted scenes are rarely to be found in a movie that otherwise lacks orientation and a satisfying denouement. ""Birdman"" starts out with a lot of dialogs and then many more dialogs follow. This is getting aggravating as one hardly cares about the characters who are altogether selfish, hysterical, flippant and pathologically unstable. One can usually count on an actor like Edward Norton to elevate an otherwise boring movie but here he doesn't really fit in and ultimately cannot even out the deficient screenplay. One major flaw is to be found in the fact that this movie should have centered entirely on Michael Keaton's character but instead it is weakened by subplots and other uninteresting characters. The most disappointing aspect is that the viewer is made to sit through endless dialogs conducted by aggravatingly high-strung actors and in the end, he is not even redeemed by a great finale. I found myself thinking all the time: ""Well, there has to be a reason why this movie is so high on IMDb ratings, thus the ending has to account for this."" In fact, it simply does not happen. The ending is pretentious, dishonest - a cheap trick. Thus: save your time and money and do not watch this pointless artsy piece of crap."

Often, the most praised movies are excruciating to watch, because they must be very clever and profound.<br/><br/>Birdman is one of such movies. A darling of the critics and the entertainment establishment, it is claustrophobic movie, cursed with a bunch of actors performing in hysterical mood and one of the most annoying ""soundtrack"" in the history of the talkies. I seriously regretted that the time of silent movies is so over.<br/><br/>In fact, what I regretted most is having watched Birdman.

","What would you do when days of glory are past? When stardust falls no more. When all that is left are haunting memories. What would you do when sacrifices turn into regrets? When you balance the terrible cost paid for smoke and dust. Would you run? Would you die? Would you live a lesser life? Or would you try rising from ashes despite having already met the darkness that comes after?<br/><br/>Birdman is an extraordinary tale of great loss. Special because it is truly legit. Personal because while most of us never reached (public) heights of Michael Keaton's character, to each of us, our own tragedies are greatest, just because we need to live them. In that sense, every sadness in this movie, every fear, every doubt, every spark of hope that we see take an eerily familiar quality. No matter that what happens in the movie is not possible, it is just a marvelous screen writing twist that invites us to dig beneath the surface and find ourselves in our darkest and loneliest hours. Plot summary would not have you expecting a great movie. Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a former superhero movie star, that tries to restart his career by writing, directing and acting theatrical adaptation of Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". What we get is a movie about producing a play, taking place inside 3 days leading to premiere.<br/><br/>First of all, anyone who ever tried to produce anything, including school play, will find a very realistic representation of what goes on behind the scenes. Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough both show two brilliant separate examples of what it means to act"". Michale Keaton is strong and convincing, but it was to be expected as he essentially plays himself. For me, most outstanding performances were Edward Norton's and particularly Emma Stone's. Norton delivers probably his best weird"" act of entire career, steps ahead of Fight Club"", but Emma steals the show with one of the best delivered monologues of the big screen (of course, done as one take, partly featured in trailer) and several stellar cue-ins to other actors' scenes. One could argue that movie is about her character as much as it is about Keaton's.<br/><br/>Much has been written about editing and camera work. Entire movie appears to be a single shot, and although time-lapses are also technically cuts, the illusion is spotless. But for me, the value here is not technical. It is how this special editing seamlessly fits the narrative and does not feel forced or tedious to watch. Definitely way more enjoyable then e.g. Memento"", that also tried to be different through editing.<br/><br/>Ah, yes, ALL of the superhero scenes are in the trailer. So you are in for a real surprise if you come to theater expecting action. But there is action everywhere and all the time, just a different kind of it.<br/><br/>Birdman is a breathtaking achievement. I'd say it's definitely worth an Oscar.<br/><br/>9/10"

The doom of theater as a relevant voice is exploited entirely throughout, giving the viewer an impression that Hollywood is demanding that stage acts simple surrender willingly or suffer defeat.

This film was an ongoing metaphorical train wreck. Edward Norton's contribution to the film to save a sinking ship seemed worthy; though the disappointment kicked into high gear the moments he wasn't featured.

My clue as to whether I would like it or not should have been "" black comedy"" description. The BIG problem was , I did not ever feel engaged by the characters, so that I did not care what happened at the end. A great movie gets you to care about the characters,so Shawshank Redemption this was not.<br/><br/>The cinematography was interesting...at first... using the feel of a single shot movie, but it was a one trick pony used WAY too long. The soundtrack, of the jazz style drumming although different (hence interesting to critics and film students) was quite distracting from the dialog. That, along with the small hallways and prolonged scenes of walking around with the camera skittering all over the place was claustrophobic and unsettling. deliberately so I am sure...

Or, was his daughter somehow pleased that he went splat on the ground? An ending designed to make students of film writes essay questions of the possible interpretations, but NOT an ending that engaged the person watching the film for entertainment as opposed to a class assignment.<br/><br/>If this wins best picture, I will be sorely disappointed; It will become one of the most forgettable winners of all time..."

I am fine with absurd movies, but they must never outstay their welcome.<br/><br/>It seems that with each year, we get a crowd of people who know a lot about movies, but being young and not finding their image in the past, want the current crop of movies to be as great as the Greats. These people are never tired of repeated tricks. It seems as if they wake up with their memories wiped out. True, some can support their movies with great dissertations. But where's the perspective? Where's the sense of proportion and why is the very act of entitlement for the present such an absurd act in itself? I knew movies have gone the same way as the music but I didn't know it was THAT bad."

","Riggan (Michael Keaton) a former successful actor who was the Super-Hero Birdman from the Birdman Comic books looks to recapture his star-power by writing, directing and starring in a Broadway play. He is basically down on his luck, says he is broke and hopes the play will put him in the spotlight once more. He faces certain hurdles as the Previews prove that all is not right. <br/><br/>This is like watching a play within a play and it was hard to see where one began and the other ended. The dialogues all sounded like they were playing to the back of the room Not good. To make matters worse we kept hearing a snare and a bass drum that were so annoying one could hardly hear what a character was saying. What was up with that? Are we back in Vaudeville? Where there punch lines? The drums played (?) throughout the entire movie. Why?<br/><br/>This was billed as a comedy. I didn't see or hear anything funny. This was nominated for Best Picture and it actually won. Unbelievable. What were they thinking? <br/><br/>This could have been a lot better, in my opinion, if many of the dialogues were toned down some, but they were what they were: mean-spirited and somewhat out of control. Riggan feels that Mike (Edward Norton) was taking over the play and upstaging him; Riggan's daughter Sam (Emma Stone) recently out of rehab goes on a tirade telling her father he really doesn't matter anymore. Nice, eh?<br/><br/>The whole movie is based upon Riggan's insecurities and at times (okay many times) he, too, goes out of control. Ah, is that a cue for the Academy to nominate Keaton for Best Actor? Keaton is a good actor but - as mentioned - this would have been a lot better if everything was toned down. To be truthful, I couldn't wait for this to be over.<br/><br/>What was good? The scenes between Sam and Mike and their truth-or-dare games were quite touching. Edward Norton as Mike, who was brought in to help save the play, was a breath of fresh air. Zach Galifianakis as Jake, Riggan's best friend and lawyer was spot on trying to keep everything together as Riggan kept going off the deep-end. Bar scene: Theater Critic (Lindsay Duncan) tells Riggan he is a fraud and Riggan tells her she is nothing more than a labeler. She vows to kill his play. <br/><br/>Still the basic problem was that we (okay I) kept seeing this as a play within a play. More separation was needed. The character dialogues sounded like they were still in the play even when they were in real time. <br/><br/>Okay, there was one funny line that Riggan stated when he was explaining his insolvency ""my health outlasted the money.""<br/><br/>Over all how this won the Oscar for Best Picture is way beyond me. I was not entertained. (3/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Nudity: No. Lesbian Kiss: Yes, briefly, nothing erotic Language: Yes. Rating: D"

Get over it an move on to something new.<br/><br/>Birdman is a fictional tale of a washed up action film actor trying to establish his importance as an artist. It's fiction and yet biographical. Michael Keaton, one of the most talented actors of our time, came to world-wide stardom in Batman. And ever since then it seems like his work has been underrated. <br/><br/>In the end, it's an artsy-fartsy attempt at a meaningful story. There's nothing new here, it's all fairly predictable.

"caseynicholson","1","9","18","14 February 2015"," The Most Overrated Film in the History of Cinema
","With the Oscars just around the corner, this week I made an attempt to watch a few of the Best Picture nominees. I started with ""Birdman"", the supposedly whimsical story of Michael Keaton's attempt to overcome his past celebrity status by rising to the occasion of a serious actor in a Broadway play. As a longtime comic book fan who grew up in the 80's, I have a special place in my heart for Keaton's portrayal of ""Batman"", and I imagined that surely this ""Birdman"" must be a neat satirical play on the advent of comic book movies playing more of a role in popular film culture than they were at the time of the Nicholson/Keaton Batman film some 20+ years ago. One would especially think that this movie was at the very least watchable and endearing, considering the fact that it's leading the Oscar nominations this year (tied with ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" for nominations in the most categories).<br/><br/>Sadly, one would be mistaken to expect much from this film. What you have here is a sad (i.e. beneath mediocre) play on ""Six Characters in Search of an Author"", the ""metatheatrical"" 20th Century play that attempts to show the personas behind characters in play before they really take form. ""Birdman"" does something akin to this, showing the character flaws of its actual actors as they attempt to engage in the real world.<br/><br/>The overall gist of the film is to highlight the neurosis of Riggan Thomson (Keaton), who some twenty years ago starred in a series of ""Birdman"" films. We quickly learn that the ""Birdman"" persona has infiltrated Keaton's psyche, leading him to imagine himself doing things that he isn't really able to do in real life (it's some time before the film makes this more overt, but that certainly was my takeaway from the opening scene of the film). Along the way we discover that Thomson is at one and the same time suffering from an ongoing inner struggle with his former alter-ego while concurrently fighting against the entire premise of being the celebrity star that is associated with the ""Birdman"" persona.<br/><br/>While the entire gist of that scenario sounds like a reasonably intriguing plot for a film, the grandiose way in which this film goes about making itself abstract and removed from conventional movie storytelling makes it extremely hard to watch, and ultimately leaves the viewer with a complete sense of remorse for why you paid good money and wasted two hours of your life watching this asinine piece of crap ""film"". I probably said that more kindly than I ought to have, but I digress.<br/><br/>The big thing that one needs to understand about this movie, though, is that it's being lauded for its cynicism about contemporary movies and its artsy-fartsy behind the scenes, insider lampooning of the film industry. It's abstract in a way that it is completely divorced from traditional movie script writing, and I suppose that it's right to say that it's ""original"" in that regard. The problem is that those who are praising this film for its originality are nitwits who lack the prudence to know when an original idea is at one and the same time a horrible idea. It's like saying that someone has invented a new method of defecating. The convention may be new and novel, but at the end of the day the result is still a pile of $#*%, plain and simple. It's clear to me that the only reason that this film is scoring as high as it is is due to its obscurity and the pretentiousness of its marketed audience, and that once the masses watch this movie on DVD and Netflix its popularity will plummet accordingly.<br/><br/>All that said, I've given this film 1/10 stars purely because 0 was not an option. The lone redeeming aspect of this movie is Emma Stone's strong performance, for which she deserves praise, but probably not a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Aside from her role, the film is one of the worst I have ever seen, on par with ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation"" andwell, aside from that jewel of a Matthew McConaughey movie, I really can't think of a movie that I disliked more than this ""Best Picture"" nominee. Michael Bay could make a ""Transformers 9"" and it would tower over this grotesque attempt at filmmaking."
"jdkraus","10","9","18","16 November 2014"," Part avant garde. Part black comedy. Part satire. Part super hero fantasy. All excellent.
","""Birdman: or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" follows both the actions and the mind of washed-up movie star Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), who is famous for his past role as Birdman. He is introduced in perhaps the most avant garde way imaginable. He floats above the floor in deep meditation as a gruff voice talks, reminding of the mess he is in and that the room he has now called home ""smells of balls."" The voice, like a poisonous Jiminy Cricket, is no other than an extension of Riggan—the Birdman. The line of fantasy and reality is blurred for him. The reality is that he is almost out of cash and his last hope of renewed fame relies on the success of a Broadway play that he's directing, writing, and starring in. His illusions and dreams will always be the fame of the Birdman—which is what he hopes to break away from. <br/><br/>The film shows both him and the audience that reinventing oneself for a comeback is never easy. Right from the start, Riggan loses an actor to a freak accident, which he replaces with an egotistical and unorthodox Method actor (Edward Norton). In every twisted way possible, he causes carnage for both the cast and Riggan. Likewise, his former drug-addicted daughter (Emma Stone) battles him every which way she can. He even has to fight a snobby, stick in the mud play critic (Lindsay Duncan). The only characters that help Riggan are his two female co- stars (Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough), his loyal publicist (Zack Galifanakis), and his supportive ex-wife (Amy Ryan), who sort of becomes the voice of reason. <br/><br/>""Birdman"" can easily be interrupted as the iconic role of Michael Keaton. After all, he is most popular for his roles as Batman in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since then, he has more or less vanished from the spotlight. Whether Keaton achieved catharsis or personal reflections in himself as Riggin, none of us can know. However, it is fair to say that this role was meant solely for him. He gives us an honest portrayal of a man who is at wits end to accomplish one last act of remembrance. He brings his flare of humor that has been seen from ""Nightshift"" and adds a new element of drama that audiences have never seen in him before. The supporting cast shares their moments of greatness, particularly Norton and Stone. Both of their chemistry on screen lights up sparks. But, it is Keaton who keeps the show moving ahead. <br/><br/>Alejandro Inarritu's visual style for this film matches the one Alfred Hitchcock pioneered in the film ""Rope,"" using only 7-8 long takes as the camera moves around from one location of the set to another. This gives the audience an incite of the various actions that happen behind-the- scenes of a stage play and it helps propel the story forward in an interesting way. This method of camera work, meticulously and flawlessly crafted by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, creates a feeling of real-life performances, where anything can happen spontaneously. The editing between scenes are carefully done with CG and time lapse effects to help master the seamless camera motions between cuts instead of simply shifting from one moment to the next. The set and production design imitate a grungy, old theater that looks real, almost disproving the notion for the viewer that the film was shot on a sound stage. The technical prowess of this film makes you feel like you really are part of the show. <br/><br/>""Birdman: or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" is an outstanding film. It breaches the conventional story method and pushes the boundaries on how far a movie can go in terms of visuals and acting. Part avant garde. Part black comedy. Part satire. Part super hero fantasy. All excellent."

It may con the voters in 2015 and win a handful of Oscars, but still it will be forgotten in a year. <br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu's ironic comedy ""Birdman"" is an outsider's take on the supposed battle between Hollywood (i.e., popular entertainment) and Broadway (i.e., theater art), in which the director dumps on both before siding with -- well, no spoilers here, but the ending is bound to appeal to sixty-something white males who happen to be members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. The script is far from realistic, unnecessarily profane, only occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, and sadly centered on the insecurities and ruminations of a barely likable cast of actor-addicts intent on bringing Raymond Carver to the stage. Maybe the script read better in Spanish. <br/><br/>Buy the premise and you'll buy the bit; I didn't buy the premise. The acting is fine, but the cinematography, with its hand-held cameras mostly following Michael Keaton as he walks through the set, cloyingly emulates cinéma vérité even as it blows kisses to Broadway. Most disappointingly, there is no hook, nothing to get into in this film, nothing to justify its two-and-one-half-hour run. <br/><br/>By the end I was checking my watch.

","This doesn't try to be humorous, but has a happy ending. Exactly like a Greek comedy.

All are so wonderful. It hurts me to see them in this Hollywood crapfest; the lowest art disguised as high art, challenging critics to rise above standard generalizations and actually say why something is bad. The standard critics won't: to do so would be accepting the insult the movie throws out.<br/><br/>Popeye: A foreigner comes to a land of phonies and is hated for his strangeness and honesty.<br/><br/>A Prairie Home Companion: A group of performers get ready to give their all for the final make-or-break show of their careers as a controller plans to shut them down for good.<br/><br/>Unbreakable: A fairly unimpressive man discovers he's a superhero and that a man he respects is actually a supervillain.<br/><br/>The Boy Who Could Fly: A developmentally disabled boy convinces a girl that he can fly. She has hallucinations (fantasies); and is looked down on by most of her peers except the one friend her mother would rather she not have. In the end it turns out that the boy really could fly; he and the girl take a suicide leap from the roof of the school.<br/><br/>Raging Bull: A man is unable to handle the psychological stress of being a celebrity among his peers and it tears his family and his life apart until he learns to laugh at himself.<br/><br/>Fritz The Cat: A catman throws away what his life has been, and explores the world and himself; in the end he grabs a stick of dynamite and ends up in hospital having an orgy.<br/><br/>Put the above in a blender called ""The Hollywood Poop Machine"", give it stellar actors and brilliant visuals, shoot it with gyroscopically stabilized directionally controlled steadicam with seamless transitions onto motion control dolly (a la, Robert Altman), give it a mindblowing percussion score by Antonio Sanchez, and insult critics that if they don't like it it's because they're just failed artists, so there won't be bad reviews, put it out through Fox Searchlight so stupid people think it's independent cinema, and you have ""Birdman"".<br/><br/>I happen to make movies. I haven't had the opportunity to succeed and so I am not yet a real failure at it. Therefore the threat to real critics who may actually have failed does not apply to me.<br/><br/>This movie fails.<br/><br/>There are little fails: In one of my own short movies people can be seen in the background who shouldn't be there and I wish I'd had the money to do a second take, or to have done the first take right.<br/><br/>In ""Birdman"" there's a ""shot"" where the camera follows a character into a stairwell; in the background, blurred, two naked figures run by. They shouldn't have been there. These people had the money to do a second take, or to've done the first take right, but we get presentation as good as mine. That's not good.<br/><br/>The filmmakers digitally removed the camera operator from mirror shots but couldn't remove two men streaking on the set. Utter carelessness.<br/><br/>There's a chase ""scene"": an unpaid taxi driver chases Michael Keaton, demanding remuneration.<br/><br/>There are middling fails: A video of Keaton walking on Broadway in his underwear goes viral. But the specific video that went viral on the first day is a compilation of all the videos of the event happening.<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>Unless Keaton's lawyer, Galifianakis, compiled them and posted them as a single video, knowing there's no bad publicity, it'd be at least a day before the inside access spin machine gathered all the clips and snapped them together. It would've contained tags and captions all through it. VERISIMILITUDE is a real word!!! And then there's the huge fail: The necessary suspense in this movie is blasé. Hitchcock is spinning in his grave, vomiting. First Ed Norton tells Michael Keaton that the gun he has is not realistic. Then we find out that Keaton is suicidal. Then we see a new, very realistic looking gun. Then see it's a real gun, loaded. Then we see Michael Keaton's not wearing a blood squib under his wig. By the time he shoots himself in the head the audience is begging him to blow his brains out and get the thing finished with, already.<br/><br/>But no; in order to maintain a low-art-standard juxtaposition, wherein every scene must mirror its counterpoint, Keaton next winds up a in a hospital room talking to his friends and family, having only shot off his nose. Then he jumps out a window.<br/><br/>His daughter comes and looks for him. She sees the open window and runs to it. Her dad is flying in the sky, alive.<br/><br/>He should have committed suicide onstage, living and dying for his art; the Birdman voice entity should have transitioned to his daughter who would have killed Ed Norton and then, thinking she could fly, would leap out the window, cutting to black before we can find out if she flies or not.<br/><br/>Chekov's Gun Ignored, case-in-point.<br/><br/>The entire third act is exactly what Hollywood wants people to think art is: Hollywood endings.<br/><br/>Being nonstandard doesn't make high art.<br/><br/>Reminding of David Lynch doesn't make a ""masterpiece"".<br/><br/>Enjoy ""Birdman"". Don't put it on a pedestal, it doesn't belong there. Compare it against ""Donnie Darko"" to see how good it is; you'll also see how good it isn't."

"pepach17","9","10","21","24 February 2015"," Finally a smart movie
","I'm writing this review with one purpose to respond to all those stupid and unreasonable haters who ''watched'' the movie. I don't really understand all the hate. I'm lying actually. I understand them completely.The title is Birdman.You expected a superhero movie, didn't you? Nope! Not this time. You see that's why you're disappointed by a movie. Because you expect it to be something that it's not. I'll tell you what this movie is about. It is a subtle satire of the sensationalism in the American entertainment industry and of the movie critics of today. A movie in today's world is not a movie if it's not a prequel of a prequel's sequel and if it doesn't involve some kind of heroes. But when there is a movie that demands of you to uh...I don't know...think while you're watching it there it goes: ''It's a load of crap...It's terrible'' and so on and so forth. In my opinion this movie really makes us think about what kind of movies we watch and how much of the attention we are paying to the acting in general. Is the theater dying out because of the sensationalist movies that we watch without thinking for ourselves after watching it. So we just say: it was good or It was bad but we don't know why we say it. It is just like that. If you were watching this movie without thinking about it for real afterward it is no miracle that you didn't like it because you are brainwashed by exactly those sensationalist crap we today call ''good movies'' and you didn't understand the message this movie wants to put out into the world. But if you didn't understand the movie you don't have to hate on it and immediately trash it. Just admit: ''Okay. I didn't understand what this was about''. Don't say: ''I didn't understand the movie so I hate it. It's rude and it's stupid. I must say that I enjoyed every minute of it and I also enjoyed all the subtle suggestions of satire of today's entertainment industry in it. So just a little advice, kids. Watch the the movie FOR REAL and then if you really didn't like it, bitch about how bad it really is and back it up with some reasonable arguments."

"chita_and","3","6","11","9 March 2015"," Where is the art of film heading ?
","I was excited when I first started to watch the film, I didn't read any reviews about it before I watched it. Al I knew was from the trailers and I knew that it received good critics. I was excited because I realized the first few minutes are part of long take and I watched carefully to see for how long it will go on. I decided that the first take ends somewhere around minute 53 when Edward Norton looks up at the sky when he is on the roof. I said to myself that is a breakthrough and a really hard thing to do, to make one single take as long as 53 minutes. Afterwards, the next long take it looks like is around 27 minutes long and I stopped paying attention when special effects appeared on screen as Keaton was walking down the street. <br/><br/>Anyway, after the movie finished, I went home and do some research to see that was actually a long take of 53 minutes. The lines of the female critic in the bar scene which talks about people forgetting about the real art also strengthened the thought that it was for real a long take with the purpose of kicking the ass of the Hollywood's money maker machines with bad acting, bad plots, as much cuts as possible and as much computer usage as possible. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this was not the case at all. The plot and the movie itself would make more sense if that was for real a long take. I did enjoyed the acting and the lighting, nothing to complain about those, and I like the 'out of the box' type of story. The theater female critic in the bar scene is talking about the spoiled kids who get awards for cartoons and pornography, 'unversed and unprepared to even attempt art'. I think that it is a good line for the film itself at some degree.<br/><br/>While researching about the long take on internet I ran into an interview of the director saying that he wanted for the movie to look like a continuous shot because it will have a different feeling. My question and my big disappointment is why did he not actually did that naturally? Why he had to use tricks to make it look like a continuous shot when the art of film, in my opinion at least, is to make hard things look easy and not vice versa..? I understand that looking like a continuous shot was not the easiest thing to do, but anyway, I don't count that as part of the art of film, but rather as a lame approach especially from a prestigious director. <br/><br/>I don't have anything against doing this type of trickery in movies, but not in a movie where art of theater is part of the plot. I don't expect to actually see a long take of 53 minutes, but I think they should have attempted some real hard to make long takes and to not leave this in the 'hands' of a computer. Computers are for the things that are impossible to make in reality. When I see in movies long takes I get the feeling of artistry and it makes me watch the film somehow different, with more respect.<br/><br/>But, this is just my opinion and I understand if people do not share the same thoughts. The film is good in many ways, but being part of the so called continuous shot, I think it fades away, at least in my eyes, and I hope the films that we see in the future will promote art of film and not offend it."

","I suppose I could have found some highly enjoyable elements in this film if it weren't for one overwhelming problem -- it made me sick. This type of film should come with a warning. Cinematography that employs hand held cameras, tight shots, and rapid movement always causes me to be nauseous. When you combine that with the trend toward very small theaters with very big screens it's a recipe for disaster. The acting in Birdman seemed quite good, but I just couldn't appreciate it. Instead, I couldn't wait for it to be over so I could get some fresh air. My anxiousness may have been exasperated by the very slow plot line. I guess I surprised at all the love this film is receiving, although there seems to be a bimodal distribution in the reviews (1's or 10's)"

","As I read the other reviews I didn't feel like anybody else ""got it"". This was just the same old story of the man fading into older age and dealing with basic family and career issues most of us do, except he was a movie star previously so everything is sort of magnified. Being a contemporary piece of the course the man is suppose to feel constantly guilty about almost everything, in spite of the fact that he was the one footing the bills.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton's character is a 60ish guy with a washed up super hero career doing Broadway. So far so credible. He is reviewing his life in his head all the time, basically feeling weird about the fact that he was a commercial sell out making millions selling us schlock . He decides he is going to make ""art"" with the Broadway thing, not unlike some billionaire developer building an art museum to ease his guilt about the falling apart cracker boxes he pushed 30 years ago ( are you listening, MOCA?).<br/><br/>The problem with the story is not that it is wrapped in a pretentious , artsy package, but that it's basic message is one that is at the root of America's main problem today. That is that men should be shamed and are guilty, no matter that his family would have starved without him.<br/><br/>In this story Keaton's daughter is set to inherit some Malibu house, and their is no mention that she is about as worthless as mammary glands on a roster. An addicted airhead, the writers seem to assume she deserves financial security as some sort of birth right. On yea, the man who paid for rehab and presumably gave her a life of luxury for 20 years should just go kill himself at the end, hopefully making it easier for her to get all his jack.<br/><br/>Hollywood writers seem to really believe this is ""No country for old men"", but they should stop and think that if it were not for old men, there would be nobody to build and maintain the houses they live in, and nobody to bequeath said homes to worthless, non working offspring. In this film Keaton is feeling constantly guilty about ""not being there"" for his daughter. Well, he was off at work providing for her and that Malibu house, so maybe you should let him stick around."
"valadas","6","8","16","3 March 2016"," A too ambitious movie
","That it does not come up that ambition. First of all the main character is rather uncongenial, a truculent and arrogant man who hostilizes almost everybody often without reason. The story is an acceptable one but not particularly moving or dramatic: an actor who was famous for his role of a comic book character and that now ends his career by trying to put a play on a Broadway theatre stage. In doing this he meets a few obstacles such as a bad relationship with another actor and some unfavourable newspaper critiques. And personally he has got a conflict with his daughter. All this is rather ordinary in human terms. Besides that he seems to confuse himself with Birdman his former character that has made him famous, hearing and listening to his voice. This is a bit inadequate. The movie is nevertheless rather good in technical cinematographic terms."
"leonblackwood","5","8","16","20 July 2015"," Not my cup of tea! 5/10
","Review: I really had high hopes for this movie because it done so well at the box office and most of the critics gave it a great write up but now that I have watched it, I feel quite disappointed. I was able to stay away from the spoilers so I didn't know that the film was set around the theatre, which I found quite boring after a while. Anyway, the movie is about a actor who became famous by playing the role as Birdman but once he stops playing the capped superhero, the work dries up and he struggles to hit the spotlight again. He then finances a Broadway play and his career and reputation rides on the play becoming a success. Whilst preparing for the opening night, his relationship with his daughter (Stone), his ex-wife (Amy Ryan), the leading actor (Norton), his pregnant girlfriend (Riseborough) and his annoying alter ego (Birdman), all play a part in making Riggan Thomson (Keaton) lose his mind, especially with a critic on his back who threatens to shut his play down. By the time that he hits the stage, the pressure really takes its toll and he takes drastic measures to finally find some peace. The storyline is original and I couldn't believe how long one shot was. The acting is superb from Keaton and the rest of the cast but I still wasn't that impressed with the concept or the direction that the movie took. I kept on waiting for something amazing to happen but it felt like a dull drama about a depressed man. I liked when his alter ego came into play, with the explosions and the massive dinosaur and I also liked the chemistry between Keaton & Norton but it did get a bit messy after a while because there was way too much going on. That's not too say that it's not a cleverly made film but it just wasn't my cup of tea. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Michael Keaton is another actor who I enjoy watching since Mr. Mom, Gung Ho, Beetlejuice, Clean & Sober, the Dream Team and Nightshift in the 80's. I liked him as Batman but the movies were crap and they really damaged his career. There are a few innuendos in this film which make it look like his alter ego was geared towards Batman but thats not on the record. He has played a part in Robocop, Need For Speed, Minions and the Other Guys but he didn't play a major role. Personally, I think he's a great actor but he has just made a lot of bad choices like Herbie Fully Loaded and Post Grad. I really couldn't see this role played by anyone else and this movie definitely wouldn't be as big as it was without Keaton in the lead. Its just a shame that he lost out at the Oscars to Eddie Redmayne. Anyway, the film was directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who is currently directing the Revenant with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy and hes made Babel, 21 Grams and Biutiful. He does have a unique style of directing, which must have been hard to achieve in this movie because the takes were extremely long. I liked the fact that he let Keaton let loose in this movie because it really pushed him to the max and Norton also showed a different side to his acting skills. Anyway, this is a well made film which made a healthy profit at the box office but I was hoping for a bit more.<br/><br/>Budget: $18million Worldwide Gross: $103million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their deep dramas about an has been actor who is performing and financing a play to bring him back into the spotlight. 5/10"

It is not worth my time - sad for I like the actors that played in it; and sadder still that the characters did not honor an industry. That the industry sometimes includes arrogant and disappointed, yet sensitive and talented individuals whose hormones are out of control, whose emotions are out of check and whose language belongs to the gutter does not justify such a poorly written plot. It is an insult against those who are professional about their work and who would not lower themselves to such a poorly written film script."

","When you have to see a movie more than once to even begin to have an inkling of what it's about then the movie has failed. At the end of this movie when I saw it the audience sat in stunned silence trying to figure out what they had just paid money for. Although Riggins' ""powers"" were obviously in his mind from the start, the bulk of the movie was so fast paced that it left the viewers no time to process what was really going on. The majority of moviegoers don't want to see Picasso when they're expecting to see Rembrandt. Keaton's and Norton's performances were spectacular and the editing making the movie look like it was done in one take moving from room to room as the story progresses was very well done. But the film was just too deep into the satire of Hollywood insider backgrounds and ""former"" stars' emotions that it was lost on the ordinary people who paid to see it. It would be like making a satire of of the trials and tribulations of a particle physicist with all the insider jokes about the subject (if there is such a thing). Very few would get it. And very few people got this movie. This was black eye to the Academy for voting it Best Picture. (That's an insider joke about people who pay to go see movies)"

The lead actor is successful but inwardly unrewarded. He has also ruined his family in search of celebrity and wealth making Hollywood action movies, which he now considers to be junk. So, he wants to redeem himself and try his hand at serious theater. Throw in a disturbed junkie daughter, a long-suffering but understanding ex wife, and a producer pulling his hair out because the play isn't a success and you've got all you need to know.<br/><br/>The rest is a montage of hackneyed hallucinations, fake suicide red-herrings, gay kisses and naked male asses.<br/><br/>A bunch of Academy Award hype and a monument to pretentiousness.<br/><br/>I wish I could have those 2 hours of my life back. I hate wasting time on junk like this.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton was trying too hard and Ed Norton was totally wasted, and the rest of the cast were stereotypical stock characters.

","This movie was excellent. It's easily my favorite movie of 2014 and it deserves every price it gets.<br/><br/>The best thing about it was that the whole film is cheated to look like it was taken in one shot. This was a great choice for several reasons. Because the movie is about actors performing a play and you actually see them doing their performances i got dangerously close to constantly reminding myself that i'm just watching actors playing a role. But the fact that you never see a cut as well as the really great performances prevented me from doing so and i got sucked right into it. The other reason is that some methods used in a theatrical production like quickly changing costumes between scenes are also most likely being used in this movie because you can't really tell where the cuts are placed.<br/><br/>I found it also great that there are not many locations. The majority takes place in a theater and you see a lot what's going on Backstage. Other places are parts of the Broadway and a bar. Aside from that there where some other locations but the characters do not stay there very long. Most of the time we are just in the theater seeing the characters preparing the play and i'm glad that this decision was made.<br/><br/>The movie also had a great sense of humor. The film never tries to rub the jokes in you face but they are very well placed and the overall pacing and directing was very good. It also criticized a lot about modern movie going audiences and modern blockbusters in general.<br/><br/>The only thing that distracted me a little was that some parts are really predictable but aside from that nothing bothered me at all and i'm still going to give this movie a perfect rating."

The Oscars must have been for the worst movie ever thrown onto the big screen. It is slow, painful and at best disjointed in its story. Trying to souse out what is happening from one minute to the next is more like stressful work then any form of enjoyment I have ever found while watching a movie. IMHO, Not worth the Oscars, not worth the money spent on buying the movie and truly not worth our time watching it. The main character is very tedious to watch, his slow battle with his internal demons/mental illness is very weak in its basis. Then add a supporting cast of others that are also fighting their own demons and the movie quickly turns into a romper room of sorts. You never feel totally invested in the main character when all are vying for the lead dramatic spot and none truly fill the role. It really is sad that the story could not have felt more stable and solid. Michael Keaton seemed to be trying to make a character out of nothing. I commend his efforts but still, effort does not a movie make."
"geekroad","1","9","19","23 February 2015"," Birdman = Turdman
","I am a native Angelino so I have a great affection for Hollywood. It has given us so many wonderful films. But within the industry there is a fetish for a certain type of film that is either about the industry itself, about acting, or about theater. These films are almost always lauded by critics and Hollywood itself, winning awards and praise. But what they lack is an audience. Because no one but Hollywood likes them. They are unfailingly boring, empty and pointless movies.<br/><br/>Birdman is such a film. Happily I did not waste money actually seeing it but read the script after it won for Best Screenplay. I'd already fingered it for a stinker ""Hollywood"" film but thought maybe I was wrong. Maybe the script would be mind-blowingly beautiful. Maybe I was missing out.<br/><br/>Although I wanted to stop 2 pages in, I kept going. Halfway through the script I told myself to stop the misery, but still pushed on. I kept hoping it wasn't really going to be this bad all the way through. But no. It was. Pointless boredom to the very last smash-cut to black. It is exactly the kind of movie it looks to be by reading the synopsis... or the first page of the script A Hollywood artsy farsty film minus much art and with extra fart. Bird fart.<br/><br/>So if you are tempted to waste money on this film, I would urge you to read the first 10 pages of the screenplay first. If that excites you, you will like the movie, so drop the script and pick up your wallet. If it doesn't, do yourself a favor and watch an old favorite movie instead."
"hassancooldude","8","9","19","21 February 2015"," Short Review
","It is a story about an actor Riggan (Michael Keaton) who is past his peak days. In his peak he used to play a superhero, Bridman. Now in his later years he regrets that he didn't validated himself as a true actor. To right his wrongs he acts in and directs a Broadway show. So the whole film revolves around that show, it feels more like a play than a film. It is a satirical commentary on the bombardment of superhero films in our age. Keaton's performance was outstanding, along with brilliant performances by Emma Stone and Edward Norton as supporting cast. The cinematography was fabulous given there are very few visible cuts. But even more so because of the long takes, which would reach upto 15 pages of dialogue at a time! The music score is also worth mentioning which is performed solely on drums."

"tomgillespie2002","8","10","22","25 February 2015"," Everything and nothing
","Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu seems to have cheered up a bit since his reach-for-the-noose-depressing trilogy of 21 Grams (2003), Babel (2006) and Biutiful (2010). The first two are excellent films (I haven't seen the third), telling honest and brutal human stories powerfully played by expert, distinguished actors, but show no signs of the kind of energy, wit and satire of his latest, Birdman, this year's Best Picture Oscar winner. We spend two hours inside the world of washed-up actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), who is having a later-than-midlife crisis trying to escape from his superstar days of being a costumed hero and trying to re-invent himself by writing, directing and starring in his own play.<br/><br/>For a film that spends so much time poking fun at the self-contained world of thespians and the empty yet highly-craved escapism of blockbuster cinema, Birdman manages to be, in it's own strange, unique way, a bit of both. When we first meet Riggan, he is meditating mid-air. He moves objects telekinetically, and his actions and decisions are criticised and mocked by his former alter- ego, Birdman himself. We are in and out of our protagonist's head, which is made even more delirious by the magnificent camera-work by Emmanuel Lubezki, one of the finest in the business. With the odd exception, for the most part Birdman appears edit-free. Day turns to night in the same shot and vice versa. But this is no mere gimmick.<br/><br/>We're on the cusp of the opening of What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, Riggan's stage adaptation of Raymond Carver's (very) short story. One of his actors is injured by a falling piece of equipment and is replaced last-minute by primadonna d**k-head Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) whose girlfriend Lesley (Naomi Watts) is already working on the play; his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is fresh out of rehab and is resentful of her father's late-in-life attempts at reconnection; his female lead Laura (Andrea Riseborough) is pregnant and tells Riggan it's his; and pompous art critic Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan) is determined to destroy the play before it's even played. It's a stressful time for Riggan to say the least, and with the illusion of watching one continuous shot, we feel right there with him. With the near- constant jazz score, we also feel every beat.<br/><br/>But the technical aspects of the movie do not overshadow the story, and it is played out by a gifted ensemble. With the loose, free- spiritedness of it all, Keaton breaks free and shines, excelling at the moments of comedy (Riggan's semi-naked dash through Times Square is a highlight), and moving us in the more tender moments involving his sympathetic ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan). He's also as precious as his fellow actors, disgruntled that Woody Harrelson, Michael Fassbender and Jeremy Renner are unavailable due to working on their highly successful franchises, resentful at he fact that he wore a cape before capes were cool. It could have been a disorientating experience, instead it's exhilarating. It could have also trodden ground covered before, but it's so on-the-nose that it feels fresh. And it may not be the best film of the year as Oscar may have you believe (my heart lies firmly with The Grand Budapest Hotel), but Birdman is everything and nothing, just like Riggan himself.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

Of course there are 2 other writers credited so I suspect the script was a translation of sorts. So I suppose Alejandro González Iñárritu has created a film populated with ""Master Thespians.""

The only reason I didn't get up and leave the theatre was that I was somewhere in the middle of a row and didn't want to disturb other people too much.<br/><br/>Then I started wondering if perhaps the movie was a drama, but then again it couldn't be, as there wasn't really any *believable* drama that happened during the course of it, and there was nothing moving or enthralling that went on. Pieces of story lines were thrown at me during the film, but nothing was ever followed up on or properly explained or seemed to play any role.<br/><br/>In the end, I'm not quite sure what this movie was, except maybe an inside joke, something which is funny if you are actually a film critic, an actor or Michael Keaton yourself, but not quite as much when you have actually paid money for to go and see it."
"ferguson-6","8","10","22","25 October 2014"," It's a Bird, It's Insane
","Greetings again from the darkness. Hollywood versus Broadway. Screen versus Stage. It's always been a bit Hatfield's and McCoy's. The basic argument comes down to celebrity versus artistic merit. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu blurs the lines with his most creative and daring project to date. It's also his funniest, but that's not really saying much since his resume includes Babel, 21 Grams and Amores Perros.<br/><br/>The basic story involves a former Hollywood actor well known for playing a superhero (Birdman) many years ago. Riggan is played by Michael Keaton, who you might recall garnered fame playing Batman many years ago. While the parallels are obvious, it's quickly forgotten thanks to a majestic performance from Mr. Keaton. Riggan is trying to prove something to himself and the world by writing, directing and starring in a stage production of Raymond Carver's short story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"".<br/><br/>Riggan's quest runs into every imaginable obstacle, not the least of which is his own internal struggle with his ego ... voiced by his former Birdman character. This could have been a more detailed exploratory view of the creative ego, but we also have money issues, casting issues, personal issues, professional issues and family issues.<br/><br/>Zach Galifianakis plays Riggan's best friend-agent-lawyer, and is the film's most grounded character. Yes, you can read the sentence again. A slimmed down Zach perfectly captures the highs and lows of the guy charged with juggling the creative egos and the business requirements of the production. Naomi Watts plays the exceedingly nervous and emotional film star making her stage debut, while her boyfriend and co-star is played by Edward Norton who, well, basically plays Edward Norton ... a critically respected method actor who is known to be a royal pain in the keister. Riggan's current squeeze, who is also an actress in the play, is played by Andrea Riseborough who gleefully blindsides him with an announcement that is unwelcome and untimely. Riggan also receives visits from his ex-wife (Amy Ryan) and is employing his fresh-from-rehab daughter (Emma Stone) in an assistant role. As if all of this wasn't enough, a tipsy Riggan botches a pub interaction with an all-powerful stage critic (Lindsay Duncan), and the two trade incisive insults regarding each other's vocation. So all of these characters and worlds collide as the production nears the always stress-inducing opening night.<br/><br/>After all of that, it's pretty easy to state that the script is the weakest part of the film. Instead, the directing, cinematography, editing and acting make for one of the most unique movie experiences of all time. Director Inarritu and famed cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and the editing team, deliver what appears to be a single take for mostly the entire run of the film. Of course we know it can't possibly be a single take, but it's so seamless that the breaks are never obvious to us as viewers. We have seen a similar approach by Alfred Hitchcock in his 1948 film Rope, but this time it's a frenetic pace, and the maze-like setting in the bowels of NYC's St James Theatre that makes this one a spectacular technical achievement.<br/><br/>Lubezki won an Oscar for his camera work on Gravity, and he has also worked on multiple Terrence Malick films, but this is the pinnacle of his career to date. It's impossible to even comprehend the coordination required for the camera work, the actor's lines and marks, the on que jazz percussion score from Antonio Sanchez, and the fluidity of movement through the narrow halls and doorways of backstage. It's truly a work of art ... whether a stage critic thinks so or not! Most every cinephile will see this one multiple times, but mainstream appeal will certainly not grab ahold. Reality, fantasy, insanity, and morbidity all play a role here and frequently occupy a character simultaneously. These aren't likable people, and the film's crucial scene forces Mr Keaton to speed-walk through Times Square in only his tighty-whities, leaving his character in the proverbial ""naked on stage"" situation. It's rare to see such unflattering looks at both the stage and screen worlds, and it's also rare to see such fine performances. Three standouts are Keaton, Norton and Stone. If the industry can avoid presenting awards to itself for ""cartoons and pornography"", these three should all capture Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>Beyond that, director Inarritu, cinematographer Lubezki, and composer Sanchez deserve special recognition for their incredibly complex technical achievements. For those who complain that Hollywoood only produces re-treads, sequels and superhero movies, take a walk on the wild side and give this one a shot. You may not love it, but you'll likely admire it."

""It will mean so much to you"" they said.<br/><br/>Oh just stop.<br/><br/>Do you want to be impressed by a single camera gimmick for 2 hours taking Best Picture? Than by all means- you've found your film. Bask in the glow of knowing all you need to do is a single long shot to get an Oscar.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good. Emma Stone is wonderful.<br/><br/>Okay, onto the bad- Michael Keaton, by maybe no fault of his own, spends two hours yelling self-indulgent spew. I mean that's what New York actors are like right?! Ugh.<br/><br/>The script has maybe one or two lines that are decently written... but other than that it's just clunky garbage that talks a lot but says nothing.<br/><br/>Honestly, if you've seen Black Swan you've seen the relatively better source material. I feel like the more people go on about Birdman's excellence the more things I find I absolutely can't stand about it.<br/><br/>If you want a film about art, moreover the film that should have ACTUALLY won best picture... go see Whiplash, seriously. It's everything this film WISHES it was."

","I watched this movie thinking it had to be good, with M.K. as the main actor. Man... was I tricked. after about a hour I started wondering what the movie is about. and kept waiting, and waiting,to find out. and I never did. No one mentioned he's delusional. so.... (don't think that's a spoiler?) and with the rest of the great cast. its hard not to think that this movie HAS to be good. but I held out to the last minute and my hope's where thrown out the window.. I've seen THOUSANDS x 10 of movies. and I can only think of about four, I would tell you not to watch. this one would be the 5th. and I would say it ranks 3rd worst. this movie should have cleaned up at the Razzie Awards. And to think that it received so many Oscar mentioning's.. I think its some sort of inside joke... almost 2 hours of my life I can never get back. ""The Interview"" was 10 x more entertaining."

","I can't explain myself how the hell is this movie so well rated here, and how the hell is it nominated for the Oscar's. It is not the best movie of the year 2014, is simply the worst boring movie of the decade made with great actors, only B class movies with low budget are so bad as it is. Don't loose your time, if you insist and go to see it, you will be expecting all the movie that something great happened, it will never be. If you want to loose your time, do anything else, making bubbles in your bathroom will be much more fun. Norton still being a great actor, this move shows you that not even that great one could make this crap a little interesting."
"Josh_Friesen","9","7","14","27 October 2014"," A Man Divided
","The must-see spectacle of 2013 was Alfonso Curron's technically brilliant Gravity, widely praised for its innovative use of the long take. This year's Birdman, made by fellow Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, seeks to one-up the long takes of Gravity by seemingly having one continuous shot.<br/><br/>It isn't a single take but that in no way diminishes the superb camera work. Instead of cutting between characters the camera glides to them, taking on a life of its own at times. The disembodied camera floating down hall ways and stairs feels both surreal and exhilarating when paired with the upbeat jazz score. The behind the scenes of a theatre production have never been more thrilling. Birdman is a bold technical exercise and instead of the B-movie that Gravity was under the surface, Birdman has soul.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton plays Riggan, a washed up ex-Hollywood Superhero who is attempting to restart his career by staging and staring in a Broadway play. However, Riggan hasn't left the past behind and the Birdman character that made him famous still plagues his thoughts. He is a man divided, in Freudian terms his psyche is split. Part of him longs for the glory days of Birdman while part of him wants to prove critics wrong, showing them he is more than just a celebrity.<br/><br/>The internal turmoil of his life mirrors the external chaos of his stage play. In an act of fate, a falling camera takes out the sole incompetent actor working for him who is replaced by the talented and egotistical Mike Shiner (Edward Norton on top form). At first Mike appears to be a god-send but quickly becomes another obstacle for Riggan. Besides stealing the spotlight in the play, Mike also develops an interest for Riggan's daughter (Emma Stone) who is fresh out of rehab and has clear daddy-issues. One of the female leads in the play claims to be pregnant with Riggan's child. Stuffed to the brim with dramatic tensions, Birdman is reminiscent of the high- speed comedy dramas of Howard Hawks. <br/><br/>Birdman is the first of two mainstream Hollywood satires this year, the second being David Cronenberg's Maps to the Stars. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (who also wrote the screenplay) fires shot after shot at the self-obsessed culture of Hollywood. This culture which at least in myth was one confined to the California hills, has now transcended Tinsletown with the dawn of the internet. Now with Facebook and Twitter everyone is just a video post away from fame and, as Edward Norton reminds us after his massive on-stage erection goes viral; there is no such thing as bad press. <br/><br/>If there is a criticism of Birdman, it's how ambitious the film is. Alejandro seemingly throws all his ideas at us and the film moves at such a brisk pace that they all can't be absorbed in a single viewing. A more restrained approach, focusing on fewer topics but in more detail instead of attempting to take on all of celebrity culture in 119 minutes may have better served the film. However, despite the chaos, the film still works, thanks in no small part to the outstanding performances in the leading and supporting roles."

","I have seen so many dreadful films recently, this is yet another one to add to the list! It is veeeeeeerrrrrrryyyyyyyyy loooooonnnnnngggggggg annnnnnnd veeeeeeerrrrrryyyyyyyyy boooooooorrrrrrriiiiiiinnnnnnnnngggggggg! I cant help wondering if this film isn't (auto)biographical in some way as like his character hadn't really been seen since playing Birdman Michael Keaton hasn't been seen since he played Batman and now he like his character are struggling to become known again. Thanks to this turd winning an Academy award Keaton has succeeded.<br/><br/>I am not surprised this turd won Academy awards as they are basically adverts. How many times have we seen a film that no-one has really heard of or really seen won one of the major awards such as best director and then been re-released because the studio knows people will, as they do, now go and watch it saying things like ' oh it's just won the best director award, lest go and see why. After all, it must be good if it got the award for best director....' Even just being nominated is enough of an advert! In this case they obviously wanted to give Michael Keaton's career a boost. I wouldn't be surprised if Kevin Costner is in a film where he is nominated for and the film wins something next! There is no explanation as to why Keaton's character, (Riggan), can do things such as turn the television off just by pointing at it with his finger or cause books to fly across the room by waving his arms. it is ridiculous! Not one person gave a performance of any note. Zack Galifianakis might as well have not been in the film as he doesn't appear until right near the end for maybe as long as two or three minutes when Riggan is lying in a hospital bed. now I come to think of it, almost the entire film was Michael Keaton the rest of the cast were in it so little that never mind them being called co-stars, they should really be called bit-part stars! I wouldn't be at all surprised if they all did have larger parts but the director and his dreadful directing cut them right back as far as he possibly could in order to reduce the length of the film which thanks to the rubbish he left in is still almost two hours long, it's just not two hours long in an anything good way! This is very much a MUST-NOT-SEE under every circumstance and in every way shape and form film!"

","A once-famous movie star is trying to regain recognition by adapting, directing and acting in a theater play.<br/><br/>The entire movie is made up of very long continuous scenes, stitched together seamlessly.<br/><br/>I think Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is overrated. I saw 4 of his previous movies and they were OK (I rated them between 5/10 and 7/10), but not nearly as amazing as people make them. Still, I had very high hopes from this movie, after all the reviews and award nominations.<br/><br/>Well, I'm disappointed. I felt very disconnected from the characters, felt nothing much is happening in the movie and wasn't too impressed by the acting."

""Selmna"" is not included in that list list simply because I haven't yet seen it.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" was self-indulgent, self-important wanky nonsense but I sat through it to the end just to feel justified in writing this review of it.<br/><br/>And finally, I play drums myself, not well I admit but capably enough (until I saw ""Whiplash"" which made me feel like a chimp with a bucket by comparison with e REAL drummer). So, I have no prejudice at all against drums. But, one of the things that annoyed the Hell out of me and my partner when we watched this mess of a movie Birdman was the pointless and distracting drumming in the soundtrack. Quite unnecessary.<br/><br/>My advice?? watch all of the other movies nominated for Best Picture this year and going back as far as you like before you waste two hours of your time on Birdman.<br/><br/>JMV"

That was sort of interesting the first time. But by the 4th, or 5th, or 10th time, it was really a cliché.<br/><br/>As are these characters. There is the former star who wants to make a comeback in something that makes him look like a real actor. A cliché when Berrymore played it, much better, in Dinner at Eight in the early 1930s. There is the daughter who is all messed up because her father never spent any time with her. There is... All these characters are just complications of clichés.<br/><br/>That leaves us with 2 hours that we have to spend watching the pitiful antics of two destructively self-centered actors, individuals for whom I could generate no sympathy whatsoever because they were totally focused on themselves, to the exclusion of those around them, whom they often hurt.<br/><br/>Why would I care about them? Why would I care about this movie about them? I don't.<br/><br/>And I don't see why you should, either."

","Birdman...what an incredibly action title. The fist time i saw the trailer i imagined iron birds crawling and swarming the city of NY while soldiers in black hawk try hunting them down alongside the main character dressed in a Birdman costume. I can understand the fact that the movie needed publicity thats why it displayed the trailer to be an action genre meanwhile 99% of the movie is drama. I least expected such from an artistic company. I could relate with the movie on the theater angle because i am a lover of stage play. Although i kept wondering did the director playback the movie before hitting the marketers? The soundtrack didn't go well with the movie at some point...like the drums over shadowing their speech. I believe if they really wanted to achieve that image they desired, they should have changed the title or rather add some proper action."

After 15 minutes of bad acting and lack of engagement we change over to Birdman....It won best movie, how bad could it be right? Well I'll put it this way...by the time it was over I was left wondering how much better my life would have been If I had just stuck it out for 2 hours watching an alien virus killing people in a small rural town in the middle of nowhere instead of this pointless, Broadway spasm.<br/><br/>Its like one of those typical movies aimed at 'the art community' even though it lacks any substance, emotion or deep message. Kind of like ""Hey I'll put this bird in there and that can represent his ego""(Not a spoiler, you can read it in the summary) and people will be like ""Wow, you are so clever. Thats like, never been done before"" ""And the acting community will totally connect with it and anyone who criticizes it will be ostracized because they just don't understand the beauty of a masterpiece"" Yeah right. I'd hate to tell you that off-beat jazz drums mixed with good actors mixed with a pointless plot does not make a good movie. And to think that a movie based on the life of the smartest man on our planet lost the 'Best Picture' to this pile of stinking pig dung.<br/><br/>The Oscars are way off now. First they gave Julianne Moore best actress?! Then they gave this Best Picture?! If you haven't seen it, don't waste your time.

I understand that the director wanted to take a different approach to this movie. It looked like it only took about 1 or 2 takes to film the whole movie! <br/><br/>The plot just wasn't very good to me! Michael Keaton plays a washed up actor you used to play a character named Birdman. He tries to get back in the acting game by being in a play. His Birdman character is stuck inside him and follows him wherever he goes.<br/><br/>I do have to admit that the acting was pretty good. Michael Keaton did deserve his Best Actor nomination. I do wish that they had closure on Edward Norton's character. He makes out with Emma Stone towards the middle of the movie and is never seen again. Like what happened to him?<br/><br/>Anyways, if you are a fan of artsy movies then you might like it. But I for sure did not! I hope that a better movie wins best picture in 2016!"

","I will start off by saying that i have never been a fan of Iñarritú's movies, even if I'm also Mexican, I prefer Cuarón any day. With that being said, looking at reviews and that fact that this is indeed a very different movie than his previous work doing comedy for the first time, working with A-list actors I like, whom by the way acted spectacular, I decided to give it a chance and I really wanted to like this one. I was disappointed, again, but at least I can say this is the one I have enjoyed the most, still, comedy? no, I barely chuckled in a couple scenes, masterpiece? not even close, the only people that can even consider it a masterpiece are hipsters, critics, and people out of place that like hating what is mainstream and love weird unpopular stuff. I bet half of these so called critics hated Interstellar and loved this one. What can I never understand is criticism, like in the Oscars, why didn't even consider The Dark Knight to be nominated? being clearly one of the best pictures of all time. Anyway that is another story.<br/><br/>I'm giving this film a 5, because of the superb acting and camera- work, but the ""humor"", story, even the ""hipster"" music and overall impact deserves nothing"

Casting was also a major failure Emma Stone is a great actress and should have never been in this role! Edward Norton, as always amazing, bringing the best of this side character.

","BIRDMAN, Or (the unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) -- (Or, The Pained μεταμόρφωσις of Batman) Dir. Alejandro Iñarritu, 2014<br/><br/>The metamophosis of Batman -- a Painful experience: A washed-up actor, who once played an iconic superhero, battles his ego and attempts to recover his family, his career and himself in the days leading up to the opening of his new Broadway play.<br/><br/>Academy Awards, 2015 (for films of 2014) Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography. My Awards: WORST in the First three categories; Pass on the Fourth. (Cinematography) But, Thank God KEATON was scratched in Favorite of Eddie Redmayne (Theory of Everything) which indicates that the Oscar voting committee is not entirely composed of imbeciles.<br/><br/>Iñarritu's BIRDMAN is a stylishly overblown over-acted over-directed over-praised and over-awarded P.o.C. (Piece of Crap) that bites off far more than it can chew. Yes, of course Actor Michael Keaton is geared up for and delivers a High decibel change of pace reflecting his own flagging career; the special effects crew are working overtime, the writers are reaching for the rarified atmosphere of All About Eve, and the photography is State of the Art, but the overall result is an annoying screecher that rings false at every turn, except for the one True Scene, when Hawkman goes flying out the window in the only sequence that rings a little true to the falseness of all the rest. <br/><br/>The whole idea of this giant stuffed bird having once been a Successful Hollwood Superhero is soaking wet -- just plain bad concept -- and the supporting cast, from usually believable Ed Norton on down, is a study in strained ""good acting"" -- actually the result of phony bad direction. Above all, who wants to watch an unattractive middle aged actor screaming his way through an actual Mid-career Mid-life crisis for two over-strained hours? Lots of people obviously did considering the box-office returns, which in my view merely reflects the fact that we live in an Age of High Anxiety where one of the main functions of film is to provide audiences with a safe arena in which to unload theirs fears and anxieties without paying high psychiatric fees whilst under the delusion that they are being entertained. There, I've said it. I did not find Iñarritu's flamboyantly fatuous Birdman the least bit entertaining -- from the pretentious secondary title, ""The unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" to the bitter End -- nothing but highly annoying and a drag all the way. A tribute to Ignorance of good taste. Saying this film is ""for the birds"" is actually an insult to the honest birdlike intelligence of birds.<br/><br/>Pass thus up and checkout Birdman of Alcatraz, or better yet, Hitchcock's THE BIRDS! Bottom Line: Non-stop inauthenticity strictly for The Birds: Iñarritu should be shipped back over the border."

It also has no redeeming value to take away. <br/><br/>To sum it up, the main character is fighting his alter ego (BM), and has an epiphany to give in to once again becoming BM. What this means is that he can confidently kill himself; THREE times (great take away). The director also jerks the audience around by allowing you to believe he is crazy and/or really is BM (both are portrayed). To me, this is a lazy gimmick that is more annoying than captivating. <br/><br/>There is the struggle to get the play off the ground, but that is just Hollywood's tribute to its ugly sister, Broadway. Frankly, stories about Hollywood or show biz, are of no interest to the average person. <br/><br/>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And all reviews have multiple viewpoints.

Lose ourselves in the intelligent and infinite sets of meta-language proposed by the feature, ranging from choice of actors to the photography and editing the film.

I like many was one of the millions around the world sucked in by a brilliant marketing campaign lasting what seemed like months in the lead up to Birdman's release. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton suits this role almost too well, as the story progresses it becomes hard to differentiate between the washed up actor and the real one. Watching Zach Galifianakis own a less retarded role was refreshing and Edward Norton is still one of those actors I'd turn gay for. Emma Stone on the other hand seemed surprisingly adept at the former junkie role. The Cinematography was what all the fuss was about I think - and It's certainly interesting, not so much a new concept but definitely leaps and bounds over any existing titles out there using similar styles - think 'Buried'. <br/><br/>Birdman feels like it's always building to something awesome and epic but before it comes you've got credits rolling down the screen.

I give it two time peeks, a personal rating system. It simply means if I check my watch twice during the film, I am not entertained and want to go home. In what I hoped would be the climactic scene, the main character jumps to what I was breathlessly hoping would be his immediate death, thereby bringing the film to a close. Sadly, no, he lives. Let's see: a man gets locked out of the theater in his underwear and has to go through a crowd to get back in. A man levitates for no apparent reason and a pretentious actor intentionally destroys a live performance out of ego and sheer disdain for that night's audience. And a bunch of people who think they too are the center of the universe occupy a screen that they have no business paying to get in to see. If this is the best thing Hollywood produces for its awards shows, then Armageddon is surely upon us. I once liked the lead actors in this film, but that have managed to outlive their careers.

Yes I 100% Believe in UFO'S THEY DO EXIST ! And the people that view these lectures are ahead of the herd the human herd . Now this is where I part with the crowd. Most ufologist want to tell the public I DO NOT. I know that if the pope,the president,a dictator,any trusted news agency came out and said yes they are here it would cause tremendous fear and panic to the public. And i'm talking about a total dismantling of what we know as a civilized world .Yes the people must be informed but how should it be done.SO AT THIS POINT I SIDE WITH SECRECY because People need to be told in such a way that they don't go madd. ﻿"

","I rarely bother to do more than rate a movie, unless it had some profound impact on me. To say that about 'Birdman' would be an understatement. <br/><br/>This movie left me feeling as though every emotion I've ever experienced and every thought I've ever had were condensed in 2 hours of amazing cinema and then reflected back at me, defying me to stare them in the face, right there, in my seat. <br/><br/>The need to be relevant. The despair upon figuring out that there's no such thing. The need to create an identity. The angst upon realizing that holding on to it might make you miserable. The need to connect with others. The emptiness of seeing you're actually alone. Love. Unconditional, familial love. Practical, day-to-day, love, or lack thereof. Dedication to one's craft. Elation. Societal approval. Anger. Self-hatred. Self-deprecation. Regret. Fear of dying. Detachment. Meaninglessness.<br/><br/>These are only some of the themes that struck a chord in me. <br/><br/>I think that what these people have achieved is phenomenal. Michael Keaton displays an acting range unlike anything I've seen in a while and has an intensity that is mesmerizing. The sheer courage of taking on a role that basically has him looking in the mirror is worth a round of applause. Edward Norton's character is the embodiment of the Actor, with a capital 'A', not unlike Norton himself. Emma Stone is perfectly believable as something other than cute and proper and has a few very powerful scenes. Overall, the entire cast is superb. <br/><br/>Some people are disappointed with the plot and the action. Others say it's a pretentious actor's movie. Many think it's a satire of show business. <br/><br/>It may very well be some or all of those things. But, to all these people, I say: you've missed the point. You need to look in the mirror, too."

I was surprised by the number of A list actors in this but that's about all I was surprised with. The movie is about a washed up actor who tries to reignite his career by putting on a Broadway play. I think he hears voices because his old movie posters are talking to him and for some reason thinks he has super powers. During the process of putting on the play, he fights with everyone on set. The play ends up being a big hit, and the movie ends with him flying around the city like a superhero. What?! Just what!? The ending makes no sense. So he is a super hero like he played in his movies? Or just a crazy washed up actor? And is every actor really as ostentatious as they appear to be in this movie?"

","I had somewhat high expectations for this film because I had seen the director's other work and really enjoyed the way he incorporated multi-narritives and unique character development into his films. Birdman is certainly a departure for him, and not necessarily in a good way. While there are some good elements, such as the way the film was shot pretty much in a continuous shot the whole way through, it looked like it was trying to hard to be different and got a little confusing towards the end. While the screenplay was strong at times, and I could at least grasp the general intent and the direction the characters were going, it wasn't enough to fully captivate me for the entire length of time. The effort put into innovation only made the film more confusing, and for that I'm giving this one a low rating."

","Anybody who's been through the creative process of either writing a book, a play, a short film, or anything in which they put their blood, sweat, and tears into will relate to the story depicted in Birdman. <br/><br/>Riggan Thomas once was a superstar. He became famous twenty years ago with a trilogy of superhero films in which he played the protagonist. Now that he has aged, and went through several years of being the shadow of his former self and struggling to get other significant roles, Thomas tries to reinvent himself on Broadway with a play that he wrote, that he will direct and in which he will act. However, we get to witness the creative and psychological struggles that he faces as a father, as a once popular washed-up actor, and as a creator caught up with the voice of Birdman, the one role that once made him beloved by the public, but that is now haunting him. <br/><br/>It's delightful to see Michael Keaton on the big screen again, especially in this role. Yes, he is the one man that became notorious after playing Batman in Tim Burton's cult films. I do not want to diminish the part of Keaton's career that came between these two Batman films and Birdman, but let's just say there is a similarity between Keaton's career and his character's that brings some kind of magic to the aura of this film.<br/><br/>Keaton is unforgettable as a man dealing with a wide array of creative, parental, and professional struggles. The whole cast does an unbelievable job of portraying Riggan's entourage, through a palette of atypical performances from great actors (Edward Norton, Noami Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Stone, among others).<br/><br/>Birdman in itself is a huge technical accomplishment. It's worth watching for that alone. Alejandro González Iñárritu's directing is a visual tour-de-force. Rarely do we see almost an entire movie be delivered through a tracking shot (which was slickly sewn together at a few key spots). The setting is also explored in a way that feels almost suffocating at times, drawing a great metaphor between the backstage corridors of the theatre/Riggan's dressing room and Riggan's tortured mind. The only few times he gets out of the theatre's walls, he never goes really far, and his mind never leaves the place. <br/><br/>Also, Birdman would not be the same film without its dialogue, which leads the whole film, in line with the stunning directing, to both hyper realistic and surreal places at times. Its pin-point timing, along with the constantly moving camera and the minimal soundtrack, dictate a tightly measured pace that brings the viewer in the middle of a neurosis that's peppered with just the right amounts of humor and drama.<br/><br/>Impressive work in all aspects."
"notafanof","5","4","7","1 September 2016"," Disappointing
","I fell for this film's gimmick hard. The fact that this film seems like it was shot in one take is the only good thing going for it. Unlikeable, and unsympathetic characters complaining about their miserable existences to a repetitive drum beat is not what I would call quality entertainment.The acting, while good, feels forcefully cringe worthy and snobbish. The characters are insufferable because most of them are theater actors, as if that's an excuse to get me to like or relate to any of them. The film's attempts to satirize Hollywood always come off forced, as it constantly takes shots at the over-saturation of superhero movies, celebrity self-obsession, and big budget blockbusters. Pretty much all the low hanging targets. The film ends up no better than the movies it takes shots at, with its vague plot points and cliché objective vs subjective themes that pretty much all ""smart"" films seem to cling to. In case you have not noticed, this film think it's better than you, and all your favorite movies. I guess that is the point. It's God's gift to earth, apparently. <br/><br/>I like what the director did with the Revenant, and this film is similarly well directed, but, once again, if you take away the directorial flair and the tracking shot gimmick, you get a movie so hopelessly far up its own ass, that it thinks it's seeing diamonds instead of the slick shine of its own moist innards. 5 out of 10 for pretension."

Michael Keaton plays this former film star who is seeking the approval from the world again so he stars, writes & directs his own Broadway play. The whole movie is him dealing with the drama going on in his life and him trying to keep his play a float. He has a Love Hate relationship with acting and it drives him crazy... That's the movie and about 95% of It is filmed at one location at some theatre in New York City. <br/><br/>Overall I was real bored. I think the director was hoping to make it intriguing and thought provoking but overall I was bored out of my mind.

There was no real plot of which to speak. The only cohesive thread was the self-absorbed pity party that the lead character (Keaton) was throwing for himself in the form of the play.<br/><br/>I understand that not all films are built around an exciting or adventurous plot, but the script writers missed a wonderful opportunity here. The premise was a good one, one that made me want to watch the film. But after 25 minutes I was bored and fidgeting.

"mnpollio","2","4","7","18 June 2016"," Black Swan's more pretentious self-impressed cousin
","Oscar voters and film elites adore movies that they think are about them or reflect their view of the industry, and if the legitimate stage can be woven in to give it a more literate cache, so much the better. Sometimes the results can be a true classic (see All About Eve). Other times, the result is Birdman, or as I like to call it, Black Swan's more pretentious, self-impressed cousin.<br/><br/>Riggan Thomson is an actor of certain age, whose most recognizable feat was playing a superhero on screen, before his career stagnated. He views the lead role in a stage melodrama on the Great White Way as being his avenue back to legitimacy, but finds hurdles at every turn, including but not limited to, his ex-wife Amy Ryan, dysfunctional daughter-cum-fetch-and-carry-assistant Emma Stone, pushy agent Zach Gallifianakis, unbalanced co-star Naomi Watts, temperamental co-star Edward Norton, and some fairly ludicrous appearances by Riggan's screen alter ago, Birdman, which clues us in fairly early that Riggan is a few bricks shy of a load. He pretty much crosses the edge when make-it-or-break-it stage critic Lindsay Duncan telegraphs her intention to pan the play and trash Riggan's career.<br/><br/>For all of the awards thrown at this film and all of the ""serious"" people it panders to that think it is the equivalent of inventing the wheel, one would naturally assume that the film is particularly insightful and enthralling. One would be incorrect. The film has all of the subtlety of a bulldozer and the depth of a nearly dry puddle. Director Alejandro Inarritu (who inconceivably was awarded two consecutive best directing Oscars for this mess and the underwhelming The Revenant) seems far too self-impressed with what he places on the screen leaving the viewer with the uncomfortable impression of a completely average person masturbating to themselves in the mirror and thinking it is a legendary moment. His grandiose and bombastic fantasy sequences are both sops thrown to the average film-goer who may have somehow nodded off during the endless dialog sequences and inside jokes to artsy-fartsy film fanatics who lambaste mainstream cinema as crass.<br/><br/>Watching the emotional and psychological disintegration of a main character is only fascinating if the film can draw us in to the character's plight from the start and works best when the character is initially fairly normal. As in Black Swan, Riggan is initially depicted as so tightly wound and hair-trigger unbalanced that he is off-putting immediately and then when he starts his descent, it has barely the same interest as passing a traffic accident.<br/><br/>Gallons of ink have been spilled about the irony of casting former Batman Michael Keaton as Riggan, with numerous citing Batman as his downfall and this film as his resurrection. Truthfully, Keaton turned in one fairly solid performance as Batman - the same year he gave a strong performance in Clean and Sober. He appeared beyond bored when returning for the sequel, Batman Returns, and then opting out of further sequels. He followed with a gaggle of fairly forgettable character turns and outright bad lead work before fading away for a long time. His career was far more impacted by bad choices/roles than his association with Batman, a situation fairly obvious when one views the kind of Oscar-caliber actors showing up in comic books films of late and being feted for their work both there and elsewhere at the same time. Keaton's work here is shamelessly unrestrained, hammy and unbelievable. I think he is far better in his restrained and underrated turn in the subsequent Spotlight.<br/><br/>Both Norton and Stone have some decent moments from the supporting cast, but part of the problem with this film is that there is literally no moment that seems natural. Every sequence is scripted and played like it is being put before an acting class to teach them how to hit every emotional note...and it feels like it. Never do we forget that we are watching a not especially good melodrama, featuring actors directed to pitch everything to the rafters doing BIG ACTING. Nothing in the film is especially credible, foremost the embarrassing confrontation scene between Riggan and the critic, whose near psychopathic hatred of Riggan has her planning to destroy him and the play before she has even seen it, ostensibly because this is what the writers imagine that high-falutin' critics do.<br/><br/>The ending (or endings since there are a few too many) is particularly hard to endure and foolish. Out of his mind with stress, Riggan takes to the stage with a real gun in an effort to kill himself. Despite holding the gun to the side of his head and pulling the trigger, the film goes on to a further scene wherein he only ostensibly blew off his nose. A feat which earns him a rave review from the critic and adulation from his inner circle, while no one seems to think he intended to commit suicide. This then allows him jump out the window to his death...or fly out the window to oblivion...or whatever. I doubt much of anyone cares at that point since the film wore out its shaky welcome at least a good hour beforehand. Ideally, this film can function as a cautionary tale of what kind of terrible waste of time cinema elites pretend to love to make them feel superior, that leaves everyone else cold and scratching their heads in embarrassment for their high-minded brethren."
"dindi-se","5","4","7","23 February 2016"," It does too much but says too little
","Modern cinema is commonly accused of favoring profit over art, of no longer providing the same space for artists to allow exploration and new techniques. It is certainly a false presumption considering difficulties, obstacles, pre-prepared formulas and studio demands always existed to a certain extent in the movie industry. « Birdman » and Iñarritú come to challenge this assumption and show that artistry and experimentation have not lost their place in this world. This is why it is so unfortunate that the movie spends most of its time talking about itself and its alleged qualities, preventing the viewer from engaging in the story. It is almost as if you are listening to someone perform while they keep shouting what a fantastic artist they are.<br/><br/>The plot centers on the story of Riggan Thomson (a big comeback part for Michael Keaton, long trapped by his role in « Batman »), a Hollywood actor whose fame and glory is experiencing a downfall. Tormented by his voices and visions of his big « Birdman » superhero role of the past, he plans to reinvent his career and show, on Broadway, that he can still work as a writer, actor and director. Some friends and family members work with Riggan and contribute, in major or minor parts, to the further development of his hallucinations. The movie counts with actors like Emma Stone, Edward Norton and Naomi Watts in good performances but repetitive roles.<br/><br/>The movie shows Riggs in a self-absorbed manner. His torments are often displayed in the form of satire. Everything around him, unfortunately, seems very stereotypical and calculated: from the Broadway critic to the addict child depicted in the movie, the lesbian making out session backstage, persons and elements seem heavily thought of but not deeply felt, it is hard to connect to anything or anyone in the story. Technically, it displays a superb exercise of camera work: it often feels like it is done in a single shot. The narrow corridors, tight rooms and backstage scenes can represent both the narrow mind and confusion experienced by Riggs, but also how it pushes the viewer to feel, and unfortunately what he/she cannot escape from. The constant self-boosting of worth, bragging and confidence of the movie, added to the never-ending drumming of the music score, feels exaggerated, fluttery and unrelenting from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Perhaps it would be safe to say that what « Birdman » lacks is some soul, a heartfelt connection to any sort of plea, self-analysis, redemption. As it constantly revolves around itself and tells the viewer what to do or make of it, it makes it difficult for persons to go beyond what it shows. It seems very convinced of its superiority, the main problem being that it certainly says more than what it does."

","Birdman reminds me so much of other supposedly great artistic movies that won Best Picture Oscars, yet were never embraced by fans. For example, Big Boys Don't Cry was touted by critics as so great, yet I think it stunk. I guess I'm not artistic enough to appreciate the depth of the director's masterpiece. Or Leaving Las Vegas, where Cage won an Oscar - another boring tedious film.<br/><br/>Enter Birdman. The story revolves around an aging Hollywood movie actor Riggan (Michael Keaton) who has tired of playing a superhero Birdman (obvious play on the Batman series) and decides to direct and star in a play on Broadway to prove that he really can act, not just put on a Birdman suit. The cast of characters is interesting - his daughter played by Emma Stone. His agent/confidant/lawyer played by ZachG. But his biggest friend/foe is Edward Norton, who plays this supposedly great actor who decides to step in and save the day when the play is in its final preparation and the lead actor is discovered to be talentless.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton delivers, kind of like Mickey Rourke did in The Wrestler. He delivers great emotion and depth of character. He deserved best acting awards/nominations. Norton delivered an obnoxious spoiled brat who was used to getting what he wanted, in all aspects of his life. Overall, strong acting from the leads.<br/><br/>But the story inevitably fails because it leaned too heavily on sex, drugs, and meaningless banter and open-ended sub-plots that just dragged it down. At one point, it reminded me of the disgusting Wolf of Wall Street with pointless sexual innuendos. I guess the director was trying to show how many different ways Keaton's character was being abused and pulled. But it left me exasperated when I wanted to get to the point and see if he could succeed or not on Broadway.<br/><br/>After preparing for weeks, he is ready of the real opening night. The famous ending leaves me scratching my head. I googled explanations of the ending, and found one that said there were three different interpretations I could have. That's when I decided this movie was 5/10. If I can ""imagine"" three different meanings of the ending, the movie failed. This was just too much of an artistic leap for me. I saw a movie, The Enemy, where there was a confusing ending, but then I read the explanation, and there was ONE clear explanation that clarified the whole movie. I said - Oh - that's cool! I get it. <br/><br/>Not with Birdman. For me, it was great acting from mostly Keaton, a tiring screenplay, and a confusing ending. That is my take, but you be the judge.

","I've tried to keep this spoiler-free, so the writing will seem bland and unspecific, if you would like my thoughts of specific plot points, you can read the bottom bit after reading the rest.<br/><br/>After hearing the mountain of hype critics have been giving this movie, I decided to watch this against my better judgment (I've been burnt by several critical darlings in the past). After an over-the-top stylish credits sequence with what I realized would be the soundtrack (a near-constant string of drum solos), I was immediately impressed by the cinematography, which for about 95% of the movie is shot and edited to look like one incredibly long take (which it isn't, but looks pretty realistic).<br/><br/>The lighting, framing, sweeping camera and distinct lack of cuts after the first few minutes was amazing. The story on the other hand, takes a while to get going. Although Keaton and Norton are great together on screen, I liked some of the commentary of the current state of movies and the pretense of theater as ""the superior medium"". I thought that they made the critic character who plays a minor role in the film way too ""evil"" to be interesting, but that was a fairly minor issue compared to the rest.<br/><br/>I didn't really connect with the story until about halfway through the movie when twists occurred and some real conflict started sparking up. That's unfortunately, when all the setup of the first two thirds of the movie devolve into a weird 3rd act where everything comes collapsing down.<br/><br/>After the movie's rather abrupt ending (instantly reminded me of the letdown I had when I saw The Wrestler's ending credits appear), I realized that about half the characters, plots and character arcs were simply just dropped and forgotten about around to 60-70% mark. None of the major plots or characters were tied up or referenced. No closure, no resolutions, nothing. It literally just forgot about half the story. It makes me wonder why several characters even existed.<br/><br/>Overall I found the movie extremely well-crafted despite dropping the ""one-take"" illusion about 3 times in the movie in completely weird and unnecessary parts, as well as my personal loathing of the grating drum soundtrack, which felt distracting and didn't jive with the rest of the movie for me.<br/><br/>Below are more specific comments which may include minor spoilers.<br/><br/>SPOILERS (Do not read if you are averse to spoilers): --------------<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with the movie is that most of the major plots and subplots -- Riggan's daughter Sam (Emma Stone, Mike (Edward Norton), Mike's relationship with Sam and Leslie (Naomi Watts), his bumpy relationship with his current girlfriend Laura and his ex Sylvia -- were left completely unresolved. Perhaps maybe one or two of these not completely tied up would be acceptable, but it seems like a complete waste of time to spend over an hour developing all of this story just to forget these characters even exist toward the end of the movie. Yes, two of the above characters were present in the final scenes, but they might as well been hospital staff for all that it mattered to their respective stories. Oh and don't get me started on the damn asteroid cuts that completely cut in and derail the entire movie and are not referenced anywhere else in the film. Overall, some cool moments and great film-making, but with badly resolved subplots and a muddled ending."

The main character is about 60, and doing Broadway like so many do. It has the pace and score of an art house movie , but at it's core is about as typical a Hollywood movie as you can get.<br/><br/>It is supposedly about a guy struggling to make an artistic play after enjoying the luxuries afforded by making a lifetime of lucrative schlock.

He was rich , famous, did not abuse his daughter, so what is the problem? Ahhhhhhhh! He wasn't THERE, AHHHHHHH! <br/><br/>No matter that our grandparents were whipped regularly and went hungry during the great depression, had to work at 13 and still loved their parents; but only in America today can writers portray a guy who feels suicidally guilty for having worked long hours, had a mistress, and was emotionally not there 24/7. <br/><br/>In in other place today, or even any other time here, it is only in American that the male can be SHAMED for working hard and providing riches to his family because it resulted in a couple of missed recitals and a ball game.

I bought it on BluRay sight unseen on the day it was released. How could it be horrible? It cleaned up on Oscar night!!!! My mistake. Wow, what a waste of money. The Academy should all be fired for this farce.

The guy won ""Best Director"" for this???? With the exception of the editing, there was no direction. Ugh.<br/><br/>The cast is first-rate, no doubt. The movie is not. I'm still waiting for Ashton Kutcher to walk out from behind a curtain, take back the Oscar and tell me, ""You've been Punk'd!!"". <br/><br/>You would be better served spending your money on a pack of smokes, a six-pack and sitting on top of a building watching the world go by beneath your feet.

I do like movies that make me think. But with the magical realism, it took me to a series of possibilities unable to make any sort of conclusion. Perhaps my linear train of thought needed to be shaken up, and this was the Director's clever way of taking me inside the mind of a suicidal schizophrenic. <br/><br/>The best part of this movie was the acting. The worst part of the movie was the soundtrack. The staccato drumming seriously effed with my brain waves, and distracted from the film. I don't think the screenplay was very good. I do feel rather clobbered with the clever camera-work, it didn't seem a means to an end, it for me became a means in displaying technical prowess at the expense of sharing the story.<br/><br/>In the hype before Oscar week, I heard that the Voting Academy was made up of white 60ish year old males. Perhaps they saw themselves in so much of Michael Keaton's performance? Perhaps their vote was a big eff you to the consuming audience. Yes, there was much pretension in this film. Please please please, Hollywood, diversify your voting board.<br/><br/>Life isn't all sunshine and lollipops. Can't a gripping story speak for itself? Do we really need to have the message beaten into us? Is there no room for subtlety and nuance? <br/><br/>Honestly? Snicker snicker, we the consumers are poked fun at with our craving for violence, and expensive overblown superhero type movies.

"Dunham16","10","7","15","5 March 2015"," Brilliant blend of iconic movie themes
","The brilliance of this film is so many vital Hollywood themes combined into a single story line of depth and insight. More and more people today too young to retire find their life falling apart after their thirties and forties in a different economic and social climate seemed fulfilling. Michael Keaton's character has money and fame and a family and respect throughout the Broadway theater world from audiences and critics alike. Feeling unwanted because no one listens or cares without a self aggrandizing motive, perhaps a catty, stinging remark, perhaps visibly uncomfortable because they consider his stance of the moment too calm or too agitated, he depends on his new Broadway show, and in this case much like Mr. Marsh in 42ND STREET to build his confidence. It only makes him realize his time and values are over in the city as are his wife and daughter and his theater performing and directing career. Agatha Christie once wrote we feel old when no one is around to understand our hopes, dreams and memories. This is true of Keaton's fictitious character in this film, Melding memorabilia shots of New York landmarks, surrealistic editing to give us insight into his character's way to escape and gritty, realistic editing to explain the reality of staying on a job or hanging out somewhere when you are the last of the old guard, the photography and editing are insightful. Some of us go into whimsy and some plan a new life disowning familiar people, places and activities to find happiness once this seems more the norm of the fifty somethings.

"bibeaultj","9","7","15","17 February 2015"," A Fantastic Film That Covers a Broad Spectrum of Ideas
","Birdman is directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu (most known for the excellent ""Amores Perros"") and stars Michael Keaton as Riggan, a washed up actor who used to play a superhero (Birdman) and wants to be taken seriously, which leads him to write a play for Broadway. In the midst of this, he is struggling to have a relationship with his daughter Sam (played by Emma Stone), and is forced to deal with an extremely demanding and overall hard to work with lead actor named Mike, who is wonderfully portrayed by Edward Norton.<br/><br/>As the title states, the film isn't just about the making of this Broadway play. It's about blockbuster movies, a superhero obsessed culture, it's about pretentious film critics, and struggling to bond with your family. It's about struggling to find purpose in your life. This film is a lot more complicated than a plot synopsis would have it appear, and the film and it's messages, especially the ending, can be interpreted in thousands of ways.<br/><br/>Monologues are one of the first things that come to mind when I think about this film. Emma Stone delivers a seriously powerful one to Keaton, and Keaton delivers potentially the greatest monologue of all time (slight exaggeration, but one of the greatest) to a film critic. These monologues are a true testament to the ability of these actors and actresses. Like I mentioned earlier, Norton portrays the character of Mike extraordinarily well, in fact it might even be his best performance next to Fight Club. Keaton is amazing, much worthy of his Golden Globe win and his Oscar nomination, and Emma Stone is great, as always. It impresses me that these characters were able to remember their lines with such long takes. Speaking of which...<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know, the whole film, besides the beginning and close to the end, is designed to look like one take. You can spot some places where they most likely used editing tricks to make it look like one take when really it was just a transition into another take, but other than that, the film is completely seamless. The one take cinematography makes you feel like you're actually there with the actors, tagging along with them for the ride. ""Rope"" from Hitchcock pioneered this style, but Birdman nearly perfects it. This is truly a remarkable achievement in cinematography, directing, and editing.<br/><br/>The writing is fantastic in addition to all of this. With perfect comedic timing, excellent (previously mentioned) monologues, and just really good banter between the characters, the films kinetic directing perfectly matches the the energy of the writing.<br/><br/>The single flaw I have with this movie is the drum based soundtrack. It feels very out of place, and doesn't have the same energy the rest of the film has. It kills some moments, but this is a very small price to pay for the scenes when it's not playing, which are just incredible.<br/><br/>With wonderful performances by it's excellent cast, a great comedic tone that blends perfectly with the drama, and some excellent direction, cinematography, and editing, this is a film that perfectly displays a mastering of the craft. The drum based score might be a bit ""meh"" but it's a small price to pay for this profound experience. Go see it. One of the greatest films of 2014."

I didn't really understand what they were trying to do here. Im sure on some existential plane they had some point. Don't know what it was. Keaton was impressive so was Norton. If you wade past the confusion, There were some good performances. Overall its a movie of redemption or trying to peak.

","I was excited to go and see this film in the cinema and thankfully I was not disappointed. Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a Black Comedy starring Hollywood powerhouses like Michael Keaton and Ed Norton and is directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu (whose name I can't pronounce). <br/><br/>The film is about a washed-up actor who is famous for portraying a popular comic book character on the big screen. This actor is Riggan Thomson played by Michael Keaton who was made famous for the exact same thing. In an attempt to become ""relevant"" again, Riggan decides to adapt a novel into a Broadway stage production. <br/><br/>One of the elements to this film that really stuck out for me was the performances. Michael Keaton and Ed Norton were arguably the best, but Emma Stone and Zach Galifianakis also give stellar performances. All the actors have great chemistry on screen which helps to produce an enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>Furthermore, another thing that I liked about the film was that it wasn't entirely a Comedy, or entirely and Drama. It incorporated different elements from different genres and combined them beautifully together. There was never a point where I thought the change in tone was forced. I found myself laughing at some points and completely entranced during others.<br/><br/>Even though I mostly enjoyed this film, there were downsides in my opinion. Unfortunately I'm a bit too used to the conventional Hollywood style of filmmaking. This film seems more artsy than most films in main stream cinemas at the moment so those, like me, who don't often visit Art House cinemas may find some parts a bit weird and out of place. However, overall it didn't hinder my viewing experience too much. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Birdman is a great film that definitely deserves multiple viewings. Michael Keaton and Ed Norton give Oscar worthy performances, the story is great and offers different tones to please different viewers. If I was to have a gripe with this film it would be that some bits are a bit weird to me."
"MattBrady099","10","7","15","9 January 2015"," Birdman in my eyes is a perfect film
","Riggan: I'm nothing. I'm not even here.<br/><br/>The story to Birdman is about an wash up actor (Michael Keaton) - famous for portraying an iconic superhero - as he struggles to mount a Broadway play. In the days leading up to opening night, he battles his ego and attempts to recover his family, his career, and himself.<br/><br/>Okay in my review of Whiplash I bought this movie up mid way through the review just to give a heads up of when I'm going to watch it, because Birdman was my most hyped film of 2014. But just like every time I really wanted to see a film so baldy I have to wait for a while until I finally get a chance to watch it, story of my life really. But anywhere I was really looking forward to this movie ever since September, and now finally seeing the film I can safely say that Birdman is one of the best movie of 2014.<br/><br/>I always know that Micheal Keaton was the kind of movie star that will pick any random movie role just because... well he what's to be important and still show to everyone that he still got it, I guess?. Like early last year now he was in two movies that were pretty blah, and that was The Robocop remake and the film Need for Speed, and those films just made Keaton look like he was just cashing it in just for the sake of it. Until when I watched this movie and seeing Micheal Keaton's performance and thinking to myself ""Wait is Keaton giving probably his best performance I've ever seen in my life? I think he is"", because Keaton in this movie pretty much pulls of the best performance I've seen him in his all career. His character in this movie is like a wash up actor who had everything like love from the critics, his fans. Yeah he still dose have that Keaton thing that he always dose in his previous movies, but the scenes where he plays his character (Which is himself if you really look at his character in this movie) but anywhere he still gives a strong and believable performance that at times give me flashbacks of the good old days where he still had roots and felt like he isn't just cashing it in. I hear a lot of Oscar buzz about his performance in this movie, and I wouldn't be surprise if he wins because he totally deserves it. Excellent work Keaton.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is this movie pretty much plays a familiar character to himself has the hard to work with actor that at times doesn't follow the lines that he was given or even the direction he was told. We already know that Norton is a fantastic actor in his previous work, but in this movie his performance could be descried has stellar and insanely good.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is this movie and of course like most of the actors I named of so far of who outstanding they were in this movie and well you can already guess what I'm going to say next. Emma Stone acting in this movie was just terrific and marvellous to watch in this movie and it's good to see a real break out performance from her more than the lay back ones in her other movies. Nice one Emma. The other cast in the movie like Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis both did good as well.<br/><br/>The movie is shot to look like it's all one shot take and my mind was just blown away by that fact. There where screens were I said to myself ""Oh my god is it one shot?"", well I can already imagine the stress, hard work and how many takes they had to do to get it, and boy did it pay off nicely, because I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I dared myself to look away from the beautiful cinematography and the impressive editing used in the film.<br/><br/>The movie has a brilliant message about film critics today that doesn't feel like it's in your face message that you normally get in movies. There is a scene in this movie and it's not a spoiler by the way, but I really need to get this out the way first. So anywhere Micheal Keaton character just starts having a rant over this theater critic who is going to give a bad review to his play when she hasn't even seen it or seen any of the premieres. He talks about how she only users big words that nobody will say in person and shes to lazy to come up what she really thinks about it so she users big words just to fill in the sentence. This movie probably has the best rant in movie history and Keaton in that scene shows how good of a actor that he is.<br/><br/>For problems in the movie... I really don't have any to be honest.<br/><br/>I loved this movie and yes I'm coming out be saying that. This isn't just the best movie of the year and such, no this is just flawless film making right here. Birdman and Whiplash are the two films I will highly recommend to people because those two films are my favorite films of 2014."

","A (moslty) single-shot movie in the vein of Hitchcock's Rope (there's even a sly reference to it right near the beginning), this film stars Michael Keaton as a washed-up Hollywood actor, famous for playing superhero Birdman, trying to regain his clout by starring in a Raymond Carver adaptation (which he wrote) on Broadway. As the film opens, one of his co-stars is injured on set (thankfully, as far as Keaton's concerned), and he replaces him with famous but difficult stage star Edward Norton, who proceeds to throw the show into complete chaos. Other characters include Keaton's lawyer/manager/best friend Zach Galafianakis, his daughter Emma Stone, his other co-stars Naomi Watts (Norton's girlfriend) and Andrea Riseborough (Keaton's own girlfriend), as well as Amy Ryan, Keaton's ex-wife. Keaton is also stalked by the disembodied (at least at the start) voice of his character Birdman, who taunts him and urges him to do awful things. This is a high wire act, and it's pulled off beautifully. Sure, it's a bit stagy and a bit pretentious (as are all of Iñárritu's films), but, because of the setting, it works. It also helps that all the performances are so great, and it's aided immeasurably by the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki. I also like the mostly drum score by Antonio Sanchez, which gives the whole thing a jittery feel. I wasn't quite sold on the ending. It may have been foreshadowed thoroughly, but it just didn't quite work for me. I don't mind that they broke away from the one shot for the epilogue, but I don't like the way they did it. An excellent film, though, most certainly."

","The director is a genius. The cast is fantastic. The filmmaking seems brilliant. However, the result? When I heard that Inarritu would make a comedy, in fact black comedy, I approached this idea with suspicion, but later after the posters, trailers and the story revealed, I was excited enough to see and appreciate the film. Birdman is a typical example of ""style over substance"" word by word. The one shot nature of the work makes the film worthy and technically brilliant, also it is an important event for the history of cinema, but there was no emotion among those very talky characters. This is a very talky movie. People talk, talk and talk, so there is no time to think about, there is no time for ""art"". This is a different type of art house movie. The idea of a disgraced actor played by great Michael Keaton ironically who has an alter ego Birdman (need to say Batman?) sounds very interesting and emotional, but the film ignores all and just deals with technical wizardry. Michael Keaton is great, but there is not any single character who you can develop empathy or sympathy in this movie. They just talk! This is that kind of a film that all those great actors or actresses come together in a movie, but the film is not as glorious as the dreamy cast. I am sorry, but I think the upcoming movie ""Hail Caesar!"" will be much like the same. Emma Stone was remarkable, Naomi Watts does her parts, Amy Ryan is the same, but Edward Norton was just there... One of the greatest actors of all time! He was like a ghost. Again nothing to deliver. The fall and ruined life of our main character could have been delivered in a different way, a more powerful, devastating way like Mickey Rourke's The Wrestler. However, what we have is a very pretentious artsy film. Of course, there are some very interesting or funny moments in the film, but other than this, it feels like an empty style over substance film. Style for style. The criticism of mainstream cinema, entertainment industry or fame works pretty well, but it remains an idea rather than a story in the film. I prefer Robert Altman's masterpiece The Player over this film. I appreciate that Inarritu takes risk and tries different type of films, but the result is not spectacular. You cannot enter the movie, it just spits you out. Some people call Birdman as quintessential cinema, but if you ask me it is rather ""anti-cinema"". I appreciate the movie for what it is, I can appreciate its technical aspect and the making of the film, but I didn't enjoy the movie a bit, because the movie was not natural, it was far fetched thanks to its pseudo intellectual manner. The story includes a tragedy, but the movie just cannot deliver it to us. If you like Fellini's Otto e Mezzo, you will love this film."

The whole thing is overplayed and utterly unconvincing.<br/><br/>The whole thing goes on and on on and on on and on on and on on and on on and on on and on and on on and on on and on and on on and on on and and on and on on and on on and on and on on and on on and frankly gets nowhere. <br/><br/>It's well photographed which is the best I can say for it. <br/><br/>A waste of two hours of my life."

","What were the Academy's guys thinking? I need to admit that I've been frustrated with the nominations from the last year. ""It couldn't be more ridiculous"" - I thought. Until: Birdman, the Best Motion Picture of the Year.<br/><br/>The story is nice. The main idea, at least. It turns around a decadent ex-superhero from an oldie 90's movie. He just wants the fame and the glory back. But now (present day) he's working on another trade of performing arts: a dramatical play based on a classic Raymond Carver's book. The actors are great. With the highlights pointed on Michael Keaton, he has gathered all of his best and put on this movie. You can see a great acting from Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts too. Actually, it's what really saves the movie from trash. The story, unfortunately, has some evident holes and, of course, no one in their right mind would give a Best Motion Picture's Oscar to this movie. That would be, at least, insane. Is a shame that the story has been developed so badly. It could be better."

","Why on earth was this film nominated for so many awards? All I got out of ""Birdman"" was that the ""actor"" the film followed was washed up and was looking for something to redeem himself. Instead of a genuine story, however, the viewer is forced to suffer through a half- written clunker that seems to focus more on crude sex jokes and innuendo than the actual story plot. The film itself just does not make much sense at all, which makes it challenging to tell where the writers are going here. <br/><br/>I also found Riggan's unrealistic ""ability"" to levitate and move things around without even touching them to be incredibly stupid. The ending, in itself, was even worse, as Sam, Riggan's daughter, finds a hospital bathroom window open, where Riggan was staying at the time after it was revealed that he botched his own suicide, only to discover that he is not there and has assumingly ""flown away"" with the birds into the sky. The film ends as Sam looks down the street, slowly up to the sky and then smiles. <br/><br/>What a lousy film. If this really qualifies as ""quality entertainment"" these days, then I think it's safe to say that some of these movie critics should either retire or be out of a job altogether."

","I just don't get it. I really wanted to like Birman and went in with no expectation other than the knowledge it had won many awards. I was thoroughly disappointed, and as others have pointed out if it doesn't capture yo in the first twenty minutes turn it off, it doesn't get better. It is the type of film that leaves even cineliterate viewers wondering who the hell it is trying to impress and I have to agree that I think it is critics, in a way it sees it was made to win awards not to entertain, or provide insight or commentary. The final half hour is the best part of the film and it finally picks up the pace and starts to become bit more interesting, but then it ends. It just ends. It is one of the worst endings I have seen since I watched Eden Lake and even that frustrated me, this ending was just the cherry on top of a sh*tty cake of a movie and instead of being annoyed I just thought oh, its ended. The plot is poor, the dialogue pretentious and the whole thing leaves you wondering what you've missed that others must've somehow understood. The only positive about this film is the acting by Stone and Keaton. I don't know what Edward Norton was doing but it was incredibly cringey. I see what the director was trying to do with the shooting style but unfortunately this is a case of style over substance, and there is little of both."
"deacon_blues-3","5","5","10","16 June 2015"," showbiz indulges itself at the audience's expense
","I do appreciate the technical aspects of this film: the use of single take/shot filming, the incorporation of magic realism as a plot device, and the cynicism/sarcasm directed toward the narcissism and egoism that is ubiquitous within the theatrical community. The acting is very good. <br/><br/>My problem is that all this destructive self-centeredness gets really tedious after about the first half hour of the film. The use of magic realism seems inconsistent, since it is portrayed as a personal delusion throughout the body of the film, only to be shared (rather ambiguously) by one other person at the very end. At that point it is unclear what that shared reality is supposed to mean. Is the film affirming suicide as a path to personal fulfillment? Can Riggan actually fly? Is Sam happy for her father in his desire to ""go out on top?"" The entire effect is unsatisfying at best.<br/><br/>I have a low tolerance about indulging fools in their folly, I admit. The only character who is worthwhile as a person is Riggan's ex, and she is a very minor character, although essential. Sam's tirade against her father is spot on, but falls flat without acknowledgment.<br/><br/>All in all, a mixed bag of tricks that are altogether un-compelling."

","First of all there seemed to be two films. The Black Comedy and Smallville style costume free superhero film that was advertised, and this miserablist Art House thing that we ended up watching. Obviously the media decided that if they advertised it as seen no one would have gone to see it and they would never have recovered the SFX costs of the fantasy sequences. All the cast turned in stellar performances,however which made this even more annoying. You couldn't fault what they did with the dire script and its banal dialogue. Hollywood still doesn't know how use profanity, so why bother ? The eight uses of the word 'balls' was cringe making and made me long for Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock before they lost theirs. Perhaps the redundant use of this word was a comment on the film and it was a load of them after all ? The best thing in it was the use of Batman's modulated voice as his Harvey like alter ego. But then they had to ruin it by making him a solid hallucination and showing us some chickenman joke figure. We never saw Harvey.....better film. The long continuous shots were done better in Rope and had better joins to hide the fact that in places they weren't continuous. Steadycam has already been done to death and merely made you nauseous. That bloody drummer - he was annoying from the credits onward. When he appeared for real (twice) why did no one tell him to Shut the f*** up ? I kept waiting for this to get better - it didn't. The film should have ended when he shot himself. But you could tell they'd added another 10 minutes on the end for the 'ambiguous ending'. There was no need for this. Also, even Kevin Spacey in the weird KPAC did the alien thing better !"

","The script for the movie was boring though the plot and setting were promising. Ed Norton and Brittany Murphy have had more challenging roles. Zach is always meddlesome and less verbose. If there was a set of scenes cut together from someone's GoPro backstage in Broadway, then the result may have been just as boring and more real. The internal insanity of the main character could have had more emotion. Flirting between Ed Norton and Brittany Murphy's character started dull. Internal narratives during the drama gave the audience insight into the characters' thoughts. This kind of intimacy brought out a whole dimension which reduced the nearly documentary feel and abstraction. Knowing the thoughts in some of the other characters during certain stages of the movie would have been engaging."

I walked out near the end as I couldn't take it anymore. I'd love to see what other people see in this, but I feel mislead by the reviews and don't agree at all with critics praising this film ad-nauseam.

In this movie there are a bunch of characters doing strange things for reasons known only to them. The eccentricity of Ed Norton was funny, it was entertaining. Other than that, I did not like any character. The scene with Keaton running around in underwear was funny. More people should have been running around naked to make the movie more entertaining. Other that that, there was nothing much funny about the movie. Towards the end keaton tries to commit suicide. I got excited about that, but was disappointed soon to find out that he was still alive.

","Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, staring Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton,Emma Stone and Naomi Watts. An actor who used to play the part of a superhero for a series of films decides to try and resurrect his career and reestablish his family with a play he places all his hopes in.<br/><br/>This film created all kinds of award buzz and won it's fair share as well. Though interestingly enough not one of the trailers that I saw gave any kind of hint or true description of what this film was actually about, the trailer's were short and sweet. The only trailer that I saw with any actual content was at a train station where this scene depicting that moment in the film where Keaton controls explosions and takes flight. This alone I found very clever after having watched the film and understood it's clever script, Birdman deplores that as an audience we no longer seek to watch deep philosophical debates and instead wish to witness explosions and action sequences. Indeed the first part of this film really takes note on how many superhero films are currently been made and name after name disappearing into the black hole of comic adaptations unable to perform a play, so the film argues. With Michael Keaton as the main star, one which I do not think anyone else would have been able to play as the film seems designed for Keaton, the film has a very strong start.<br/><br/>The editing is something to particularly marvel at, with editing it appears that nearly all the film is just one continuous shot. This gives the first act a pace reminiscent of 'The West Wing' with fast dialogue and quick pacing of the characters. While this first act is very strong as it's a unique take on a film that makes it very engaging, the focus is somewhat lost in the second act. A slower pace is now established which begins to drag on the narrative of the plot which in turn then creates this slower pace for the rest of the film, which with only minor moments in scenes resorting back and giving hope. A shame considering some moments in particular later on are really engaging but lose the gravitas it should have had.<br/><br/>Here is where I disagree with the Academy Awards, when examining some of the films nominated for best picture such as 'Whiplash', 'Boyhood' and 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' all these films were not only engaging throughout but left me with a hunger for more, captivating throughout and brought a real energy to the film. Birdman while a really interesting choice for the reasons previously mentioned, truly lacking in both this aspects. A shame given the great performances, the thought provoking script and the music to accompany.<br/><br/>I watched this film some time ago and decided to re-watch it for the sake of reviewing and still I reached the same problem in the focus of the energy. OVERALL *** A clever thought provoking film with a unique cast and direction but ultimately let down by the uneven tempo, the slow pace and its own lacklustre energy after the first act is disappointing with a few pivotal moments of grace.<br/><br/>RECOMMENDATION- I would still highly recommend as it is a superb film and maybe it is just me who feels this way but I do not think it should have received best picture."

","Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a washed-up actor who was a big name about 20 years ago as The Birdman. Thomson has now decided to turn his hand to directing and is attempting to complete his Broadway play production. However, this proves to be less than straight-forward when he faces budgeting problems, a difficult actor, a scathing critic and an inner voice that may turn Thomson's life upside down.<br/><br/>I'll kick this review off by saying that I thought Michael Keaton was fantastic here and did everything in his power to give his character as much life and depth as possible. Err that's the only positive that I have for this film....<br/><br/>I think with better writing this could have been a truly great film, but what really hurts it is its total failure to explore its central character. I never really felt anything for Thomson, not pity, not hatred. He basically just yelled at people, scrapped with people, did stupid things and then had his 'inner voice' talking to him. When the film ended I thought to myself 'What did I actually learn about Thomson?' The answer of which was 'Nothing' <br/><br/>The last paragraph was perhaps a little too philosophical so let's look at more obvious problems; the film was chocked full of unlikeable, sleazy and sordid characters. The plot was so thin that it was practically invisible and worst of all it was so boring. At about 80 minutes in I was losing the will to live and was just praying for the end. I think the reason that I was so bored was that there was no real story, no real point to any of it, and no-one to give a damn about.<br/><br/>The potential was definitely there and I fully appreciate that the point of this film was to explore a man that could never really let go of the past, but it just isn't handled very well here.<br/><br/>FINAL NOTE; it seems that shooting one's own nose off is the answer to being popular and getting noticed. Brilliant!!"

Somehow this film feels like it would find favour amongst US actors who have been on the Broadway circuit and foolishly believe that there is such thing as a ""New York state of mind."" It tries to deal with some interesting themes - 'feelings of irrelevance as we age' being the main one. However it doesn't flesh it out enough and keeps interrupting itself with these stupid injections of his superhero character from yesteryear.<br/><br/>The only advice I have is this: if you feel like turning it off 30 mins in, go ahead and do so.

Unlike Whiplash though, this was a different sort of experience, definitely one I had to get used to. The film's ""one take"" structure really does sort of push the film into the audience, to fully take the characters in and at times be overwhelming. It took me about 30 minutes to be fully immersed in it, but when I did, it functioned as a character drama in such extraordinary ways, and in ways that really hit me afterwards. By the time it was over, I was ready to watch it again, it's one of those films... I also want to say that it feels like such an instant classic. I don't think any recent film in years has felt this way, but this really does. I'm also surprised by how it's one of the two front-runners for awards, I wouldn't have thought as many people would be as open to it but I'm so glad. The ensemble is amazing, with Norton and Keaton being among the best of the year. I actually think that it's such a shame that both Simmons and Norton came out the same year because both would've made more-than-worthy winners.

","I had to watch this movie because of all the hype and nominations and just couldn't wait to see something that looked interesting. <br/><br/>Don't get caught up by my rating though, I will say there are some nice things about this movie. Firstly, the acting was really great. Keaton and the other actors had very realistic emotions and acting. They are truly believable actors. Keaton, a washed up actor who played a fictional movie hero ""Birdman,"" tries to evolve from an action packed star into art and theater, trying to find true emotion and symbolism. He puts everything into directing this play including ignoring his already distant family and giving up everything he owns to pay for its production. The viewer sees as the movie progresses that the main actor is slowly losing his grip in reality. As opening day comes he realizes more and more, how more impossible his dream is becoming. This is where the viewer must focus on the mood, the thoughts, and even the meaning of the background sounds/tunes. What do these mean? And how should you apply them to the ending?<br/><br/>Was it artistic? Yes, it was very artistic and interesting. However, the plot just seemed so boring. I applaud anyone who went through the first 20 minutes and still had patience. The plot really isn't anything new. Keaton plays a dad who made it big and lost sight of the things that mattered like his family and true loved ones. Alright, alright, same story played differently. I know the play was supposed to look mediocre, but just the added screen time devoted to showing it made the movie even more boring. Seeing these parts over and over again. The movie is simply a dead beat washed up father who stubbornly chooses to go down with the ship. Some movies you just know whats going to happen and you hate those, well... this one is kind of the opposite but its kind of dreadful. <br/><br/>The artistic aspect was alright. Its not something we haven't seen before like Shutter Island, Inception, or other films where you really have to pay attention and figure out what the real ending implies. After, you go wow, that was interesting, and then look back at the plot, I really don't understand how you go, wow! Awesome movie! Its more like... so what? It was good acting, but I didn't feel any connection to the characters. Who cares?<br/><br/>I'd watch it again in passing but wouldn't pay attention much. Movie is quite slow and at times obnoxious.

","Alejandro González Iñárritu completely moves away from his previous work that has included deep and tragic movies such as '21 grams' and 'Babel' with this comical and at the same time meaningful look at a man's rise and fall. 'Birdman' is a film where very few recent movies have dared to go, based on a production on 'Broadway' and its many characters with their fears and ambitions. Each character portrays a different stage in a person's life with the final stage being that of 'Riggan Thomson', a struggling veteran who is hoping for one last shot at glory after his only previous claim to fame was being the face behind a superhero called 'Birdman'. On the surface this is a simple plot but the depth of this movie is how it shows different human emotions, ambitions and aspirations. The film is addictive, with its great performances where every star is so well placed in a low key role and Michael Keaton towering above as the 'Superhero' and the struggling director, writer and actor of a Broadway production. If you are a reader, this movie is for you because it goes further than most movies dare to go! @zulfmanauthor"
"tomsuthblack","6","6","13","28 February 2015"," A potentially great satire that suffered from all what it mocked!
","But being a satire doesn't absolve this could-have-been-awesome movie from the sin that ruined its greatness: Who but an intellectual elite in his detached ivory tower would ever empathize with the suicidal angst of the unbelievable central character? I mean who in the real world of hardworking masses who struggle to pay their monthly bills and make ends meet would identify with the ""suffering"" of a person who could have created ""a billion dollars in profits worldwide guaranteed "" by playing the role of a marvel-type superhero, and who decided to ditch that chance and go both bankrupt and crazy over creating a ""serious"" play in which he plays a ""serious"" role! <br/><br/>Who in the world would accept such character as real? Who could manage to suspend disbelieve enough to be touched and changed by the movie's powerful message? A message that was supposed to be punch, a slap on the face, but was doomed to lose all of its power because the central character wasn't well designed, and ended up far from being even minimally believable. The relation between the central character and his daughter did not help much in enhancing believability. On the contrary! It only added another unbelievable character to the cast: the ""modern"" ""shallow"" daughter who was there just to deliver the most unbelievable, unauthentic and terribly artificial dialog that was supposed to sound as today's ""modern, shallow"" youth. The effort to criticize modern superficiality and shallowness was ironically very shallow and superficial itself. Being a satire is never an excuse for two-dimensional characters, silly dialog and unbelievable plots. <br/><br/>It is amazing how the movie suffered from everything it tried to criticize. It is incredible how childish the script writer's thought must've been as they made references to Robert Downy Junior and Iron man assuming that they were doing something Genius, or how the casting assumed that Michael Keaton's previous role in Batman might've added some sort of depth or credit to the movie! One shivers from the simplicity of the minds of those who assume that coining expressions like ""super reality show"" to describe the very predictable suicide scene at the end of the movie is some how a ""deep"" and ""cultured"" way to send-up reality shows. Oh, come on people. How can you be so lame??<br/><br/>So , yeah, it's just another great idea, badly executed and flattened by a mushy plot, weak characterization, adolescent imagination, and annoying (yes annoying) music .. but saved, one must admit, with GREAT acting from everyone in the cast. And also great directing and editing. <br/><br/>The biggest gain from this movie is the unmasking of critics. Those who praised the movie for the acting and directing can still be trusted, but those who gushed praise for the plot and its ""sophistication"", and ""metaphors"" and ""depth of characters"" are simply full of you know what.<br/><br/>To sum up: Birdman is one of those movies which you hate so much as it is because you admire so much what it could have been. You feel sorry and frustrated because it had that awesome potential to be a timeless classic, and a reality-changing message the way true art is supposed to be, but it ended up as a joke instead, one which mocked nothing other than itself.<br/><br/>What a loss."

","What to say about this movie? Immediately I was sold after about 5 minutes and enthusiasm lasted until the very end. Performed Keaton, shooting angles, long scenes, simple music (drums), even I thought this movie autobiographical (due Keaton) because there are a lot of links with his career (a failed actor who is best known for his role as Batman), and after that he did not have any good role (who will first mention Jackie Brown or maybe My life?) and now is trying to get back into acting through its theater play (movie Birdman). The film is full of interesting facts and, to me personally, was not at all boring as others. References to the actual film world were perfect. I almost did standing ovation in cinema when it ended. I have some objections, but very small. I give it 9.5 and to sum up the 10. Congratulations, this is the right thing for all film lovers."

","As someone who typically appreciates unusual films, I find it hard to go against the flow of excellent reviews Birdman has received.<br/><br/>However, I just did not enjoy the experience of watching this film. I found the pace slow, the characters unsympathetic (with the exception of Emma Stone as daughter Sam), the setting claustrophobic and the combination of the camera-work and the drumming on the soundtrack intensely irritating.<br/><br/>As often happens, the trailer was misleading and I had the impression I was going to see a quirky black comedy. Quirky it was, but not in the way I had expected, and while there were a couple of moments that I found a bit funny (Keaton doing a bird squawk), overall it felt relentlessly depressing and narcissistic.<br/><br/>The acting was good. I did find it interesting that it was one continuous shot. I like that a lot of thought and effort had gone into the film. I actually liked the ending.

"Sergeant_Tibbs","10","6","13","3 January 2015"," I can't imagine cinema without Birdman now.
","There's too much context to go into for Birdman. There's the state of cinema today, the state of contemporary film criticism, the transformation of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarittu, the reliably spectacular photography of Emmanuel Lubezki, the relationship between film and theater, art and commerce, and Michael Keaton's blockbuster past. Birdman offers a lot of developments and comments on cinema and operates on so many levels. I'll admit, I love meta films like this. I'm not even invested in Keaton's career of his Batman of 25 years ago, but it's difficult to ignore the over-saturation of comic book films these days and how bringing him back can speak volumes. The film even makes a sly comment on the epidemic as they list of actors who've succumbed to the cape. While there's wry grit in its commentary, this isn't a bleak and mean- spirited venture, it's overtly satirical, and that's what makes it such an endearing experience.<br/><br/>Of everything that Birdman is about, there's two factors that resonate with me the most. One, a factor explored by Edward Norton's brilliant but out of control actor Mike Shiner and a more nuanced symbolic approach by Lubezki's gliding eye, concerning the truth in fiction. And another, one which propels the narrative and protagonist, artistic legacy. The complete subtitle - The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance - smirks at this idea, hinting that it's better to be unaware at your own importance in culture. Keaton's Riggan Thompson is in hot pursuit of redeeming his legacy, smirched by his portrayal of a blockbuster hero in a past life. In risking everything, the film presents a fascinating argument on the importance of cultural impact by an individual and how they're earned. It's funny, the power of these ideas makes the universal theme of love in the Raymond Carver play the principle characters are performing feel trivial. Birdman wants love on a grand scale, as per its opening quote.<br/><br/>It's no easy journey, jostling from bumps and bruises of his ego and motivation by disastrous preview nights, offstage actor drama and lashings from his vulnerable daughter. Keaton is subdued in this first hour, merely soaking everything in, yet slowly deteriorating. He's outshined by the whirlwind overzealousness of Norton's Mike, who's never been better or more welcome to chew the scenery and question everything. He's funny, abrasive and thoroughly profound. However, in the second half Keaton steals back the show, starting from a rant against the labeling nature of criticism. He bites hard. It's extraordinary and utterly disarming in a refreshing way. It's made sweeter by how much he's been knocked off his pedestal previously in the film. Every time he's stripped of his pride, the film compensates with giving him empowering feats of telekinesis in ambiguous fantasy sequences. In breaking the bounds of reality, it's utterly liberating and a stroke of expressionistic genius.<br/><br/>While Keaton and Norton lead the herd, they're supported by a fantastic ensemble, as expected for an Inarritu film. Naomi Watts gives a tender performance as an actress eager to please in her Broadway debut. She may overplay it, but it's utterly appropriate and all the more engrossing, especially when placed beside Norton. Emma Stone, who's going to get the bulk of the supporting actress accolades, is terrific as Riggan's daughter, toeing an emotional high wire with the boldness to tumble off it. Andrea Risebourgh, Lindsay Duncan and Amy Ryan give ample support but Zach Galifianakis gives the most surprising performance of the second tier, anchoring the film in his sincerity and deep investment in the other character's lives and careers. If there are any flaws in the film, perhaps it would be that it's almost too precise. Is this an essay or a story? Offering laughs instead of tears, it's a fair critique, but one deflected by how incisive it can be at its most relevant. Doesn't stop the film from being satisfyingly overwhelming.<br/><br/>Of course, the main aspect that sticks out is that one shot. Evidently still salivating from Gravity's ambition, Emmanuel Lubezki ups the ante. Yeah, he's the star of Birdman. It's fitting, this is about theater and there's no cuts. While it may feel self-aware, the film is self-aware itself so it's very fitting. It captures this chaotic and buoyant tone of the madness of the characters and the project, but without feeling outlandish. Antonio Sanchez' innovative drum score aptly does the same, often having the ability to snap us back into gear after a short serious interlude. It's all the ingredients for a delectable recipe. If any film can duel with Whiplash for my favourite of the year, it's Birdman. It's also my new favourite of Inarritu, a director I've loved since Babel which at the time was a film that really opened my eyes to what mature cinema can be. I can't say this touched me quite as off guard but it certainly articulates everything a lot better than anyone else can. <br/><br/>9/10"
"donegalcat","6","6","13","2 January 2015"," Potential, but ultimately disappointing
","I found this film showy and way too self indulgent. The whole film is devoted to parodying itself, and acting, and theatre, and its cast and itself again. Yet it lacks the requisite humour. We get it, Keaton used to play Batman and is now washed up, and Norton is a method actor. Knowing this before hand, as would most cinema-goers does not make this parody particularly worthwhile.<br/><br/>The film takes a typical pot shot at theatre critics, and then attacks theatre for being bourgeois. Yet the film is filmed like a theatre play and it never escapes its stagey setting. Aside from Keaton and Norton, overacting at the centre, a variety of good actors are left on the sidelines in throwaway roles. Andrea Riseborough is particularly neglected and then cast aside for the majority of the film.<br/><br/>The middle of the film drags along as well before picking up at the end. But the finale is risible. The scriptwriters don't seem to have fully decided whether Keatons character is actually a birdman or just delusional so they go for both in a clichéd ending.<br/><br/>The film had potential, a great cast, some good cinematography, but ultimately it was a disappointment. Certainly shouldn't be the Oscar favourite all the critics seem to be raving about."
"rjsf96","9","8","19","4 January 2015"," A Soaring Achievement
","If there's one thing that Birdman proves it's that Michael Keaton can still own a role. This time he is poking fun at the superhero genre and the fact that he has played Batman in the past makes his appearance all the more poignant.<br/><br/>Because of the title's more than obvious hint at a superhero, some of us may be forgiven for thinking that the film concerns one. It doesn't. Instead we get a look at the deteriorating career of an actor, one that coincidentally (?) parallels that of the great Keaton. He plays Riggan who in order to restore his falling reputation (he says he turned down Birdman 4, 20 years ago) he decides to direct, write and star in his adaptation of a play no less, but that does not come without consequences and various people to contend with. As if this wasn't enough to make audiences drool we are treated to a magnificent performance from Edward Norton who appears in due course. He gives everything that he possesses with such powerful acting that it rivals his other performances. I would go as far to say his role in 'Fight Club', which astonished audiences everywhere.<br/><br/>What follows is one of the greatest films of 2014 and in fact the twenty first century. Even actors I had thought incapable of acting on a dramatic level impress me and that you can be sure is saying something. Particularly Zach Galifianakis (known for is role of a buffoon in 'The Hangover' Series) who shows restraint and a sense of control or some at least over Keaton's character, as his lawyer. <br/><br/>The female leads also astonish, namely that of Emma Stone and Naomi Watts – but when have they ever let us down? Stone here is in vast contrast to her role in the 'Spider-Man' series, which was sweet; here she is (dare I say it) bitter with her father, as well as a drug addict and practically uncontrollable. Watts ends up a bit off of the rails, but hey who can blame her?<br/><br/>I don't think that anyone would have liked Edward Norton trying to have a quick shag with you before the main event. But there is always some who wouldn't mind. I feel the need to be brief or as brief as is possible for me. It is literally magic on screen from the acting, to the set design, score, cinematography, humour (every joke finds its mark and will have you grasping the air to still breathe) and oh my script! I don't think that one has been as punchy since Aaron Sorkin's for 'The Social Network'. <br/><br/>Need I say more? This is the first I have heard of Alejandro González Iñárritu but I will be sure to follow him religiously now. Whether you are a casual film-goer or someone who considers themselves a cinephile – just do yourself a favour and see this masterpiece! It is quite possible that you will not feel this way about a film for a very long time!"
"LloydBayer","10","8","19","15 December 2014"," Birdman is a soulful satire that venerates cinema's artistic merits while simultaneously condemning it's contamination through commercialisation.
","If you've noticed during previous telecasts of the Academy Awards, there's always a short spoof movie they play at the beginning of the event. It's a parody of the year's top films where Hollywood lampoons itself. They just love to be at the center of the joke as long as the joke is told by them. Directed, produced and co-written by unconventional Mexican filmmaker Alejandro G Iñárritu, Birdman, sub-titled Or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, is one such wholesome parody – a pitch black satire where Hollywood makes roaring fun of Hollywood. <br/><br/>And it's a ton of fun from the very first scene where we see Michael Keaton levitating in his underwear. Setting off a chain of parodies is Keaton playing Riggan Thompson, a washed-up middle aged actor whose last blockbuster saw him playing the titular superhero in the 1992 sequel, ""Birdman 3"". Now 20 years on, he is desperately grasping for former glory by trying to reinvent himself as a theatre artist. As the director and producer of a Broadway play, Riggan has a few problems to tackle, starting with his alter ego, the growling and grotesque voice of Birdman (also Keaton) who taunts Riggan into insecurity and regret. These are bizarre sequences and we are left guessing whether Riggan is mentally unstable or possess supernatural abilities no one else knows about. His second problem is the passive-aggressive nature of his lead actor, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton). Known for his brilliant method acting but also infamously impulsive and abrasive, Norton is another caricature of himself as Shiner, an actor whose outbursts leads to a series of disasters on the play's preview nights. With the big opening night just around the corner, Riggan is left to overcome his final obstacle – A New York Times theatre critic (Lindsay Duncun) who loathes Hollywood celebrities for commercialising and thus tainting what was once true art in theatre. <br/><br/>One of the main parodies of this multi-layered film is the fact that the current horde of superhero films from DC Entertainment and Marvel Studios didn't quite exist until Keaton kick-started the genre in 1989 by playing the titular superhero in Batman. It gets better. Keaton hasn't been in the limelight since his 1992 blockbuster sequel, Batman Returns, the same year Riggan peaked in his acting career. Coincidence? Not really. Such is the ingenuity of this film but Keaton and Norton aren't the only ones lampooned and we'll get to that later. Comprising of an ensemble cast, Iñárritu has plenty on offer and they all deliver in uniformity starting with Emma Stone as Riggan's feisty daughter and assistant, Zach Galfianakis as his best friend and manager, Naomi Watts as his lead actress on her first Broadway show, and Amy Ryan as his ex-wife and voice of reason. <br/><br/>Why Birdman will be an Academy Award magnet is obvious. Besides Keaton's comeback of the century and Norton's outstanding delivery, this film is theoretically a movie within a movie and thematically about an actor making a comeback. That's ample flattery to win over The Academy and precisely why The Artist went Oscar crazy in 2011. But irrespective of how this film fares at the 2015 Academy Awards, the real pull is how intensely immersive this film is in creativity, imagination, performance and technical excellence. After winning an Academy Award for last year's Gravity, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki is back with more wizardry by shooting the entire film in one continuous take; Seamless digital binding, yes, but otherwise impossible to achieve conventionally. And bolstering the pace is some fantastic music from composer Antonio Sanchez who uses just percussion instruments with perfect timing. <br/><br/>That Iñárritu ends the film with ambiguity could be received with mixed reactions. Like Christopher Nolan before, Iñárritu leaves it open to interpretation and that's always a good thing when giving a film a long lasting impression. Thoroughly entertaining with endless hilarity, both slapstick and dark, Birdman plays on cinema's artistic merits while simultaneously condemning it's contamination through commercialisation. To this effect there's a mini action scene dedicated to the kind of profound stupidity found in a Michael Bay film. Another shot of a meteor plummeting to Earth speaks volumes about the death of stardom and the birth of insanity. If you look closely at the fire ball, you can almost see Bay's name on it."
"DavidStewart57","10","8","19","11 November 2014"," A Comedic and Moving Satire on Acting
","If there is at least one film that I implore you to see and embrace, it is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's latest barnburner of a movie, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). The opening shot is like the opening line out of Pynchon's ""Gravity's Rainbow"" as ""a screaming comes across the sky"" from above leading to Michael Keaton meditating in midair as he prepares for his first performance on Broadway with his adaptation of Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,"" in which he stars in and directs. The next two hours is a gripping, funny, and naked look into the world of acting, celebrity, and redemption as Riggan Thomson (Keaton), a former big budget action star from the late-Eighties, tries to get through a hectic three days of preview showings and opening night of his first and maybe last chance of acting. Within the pressure of trying to reclaim his place in the spotlight, Riggan is blindsided by his masochistic, method-acting obsessed co-star (played by Edward Norton) trying to steal his mojo while his daughter/publicist (Emma Stone) and co-star/girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough) try to tame Riggan's ego as he goes through a path of self-reflection and destruction due in part to the voices in his head telling him that ""he should have done that reality show"" and that ""nobody wants to see that talky bullshit"" he has sacrificed to put on stage. Birdman is a profound meditation on the age-old fight between art versus commerce while focusing on the desire for affection.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton gives a phenomenally funny and poignant performance as Riggan; many critics have questioned whether life imitates art in regards to Keaton's past success as Batman or Beetlejuice before petering out of top-billing status. Regardless of how close Keaton is compared to Riggan, his intensity, humor, and warmth fit perfectly in what is one of his finest performances in quite a while; his verbal sparring session with a New York Times critic shows he hasn't shown signs of slowing down, just shifting into second gear. Emma Stone gives a raw and powerful performance as he chews out his father hours before going out onstage or contemplating life on the theatre rooftop opposite Edward Norton. With a succession of previous successes on screen, Stone gives her best performance in Birdman.<br/><br/>It would be a travesty to label the rest of the cast as ""supporting actors"" as each of them give their pound of flesh on screen. Edward Norton is incredible as he satirizes the method-acting approach whether it is appearing drunk onstage to feel like Raymond Carver when he poured sweat and liquor over the typewriter or getting aroused when the stage curtains open up for him. Seeing him and Keaton clash heads and egos is like watching Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton duel on guitars. Zach Galifianakis delivers a perfect balance of humor and neurosis as Riggan's shrewd lawyer and only friend. Amy Ryan, as Riggan's ex-wife, gives a solid and stoic performance as she sees Riggan wrestle with his emotions in his dressing room. Naomi Watts, who plays a naive actress getting her first break on Broadway, savors every minute of her brief time on screen by giving a sympathetic and funny performance.<br/><br/>Alejandro Inarritu continues to raise the bar in his canon of films that focus on the human condition with a supernatural twist as he did with Biutiful and 21 Grams. Birdman is the ultimate film nerd's film as Inarritu manages to create a mesmerizing homage to the auteurs of the past; take the excess and surreal nature of Fellini's 8 1/2, the improvisation and layered characters from Altman's films mixed with the philosophical and supernatural style of Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, put it in a blender and drink it all up. If there was an Olympic competition for cinematography, Emmanuel Lubezki would reign supreme as his work on the stedicam is fluid and balletic just like his previous work with Alfonso Cuaron. With an incredible cast and a visionary filmmaker at the helm, Birdman stands out as a raw, original, and powerful work of art."

","Birdman , though the name is deceiving is not a triple a superhero movie you would expect crowding the Hollywood cinema in this age and era of movie , but this a movie that i can best describe as an experience. Birdman gets nearly every aspect of a good cinema right and in this review i will breakdown each aspect and giving you all the reasons why you need to watch this movie and also validate the fact as to why i rated this 8 and not a shot 10.<br/><br/>1) Casting and Performances :- One of the best things in the movie is the wonderfully cast roles.The movie hold an exclusive banner with a stigma array of actors ranging from industry veterans like Michael Keaton and Edward Nortan as well as others like Zach ,Emma stone , Naomi watts ,Andrea Riseborough and so on giving a stellar performance with a well clicked sense of humor and comedic timing. Michael Keaton fits the role perfectly with his brief history of being batman in it's previous iterations. Michael Keaton in this movie is named Riggan once popular for his action superhero movie birdman is now off the fame ladder and tries to make himself significant in the industry with a book adapted play shown in Broadway. Both Michael and Edward Norton taking leads of sort display a spectrum of emotions each of them having a unique charismatic peak. On a whole birdman ""shouts casting done perfectly "" in every frame.<br/><br/>2) Direction :- For people who watched Alejandro's previous movie biutiful starring Javier they are certain about one thing, a visual treat which is pleasureful to our eyes. Alejandro's camera is the first person perspective of a real event grounded in reality with each stance of the movie depicting fear , emotions ,characters even without the need of a solid dialogue delivery. Birdman is shot with some really clever camera and editing tricks to make the movie feel like it's shot in a single go. Lighting is perfectly lit , sounds are realistic , angle of shot is dispensed with utmost beauty. It's a rare trait that not many directors inhibit.<br/><br/>3) Story :- The story as seen from it's surface is simple and mild going through the struggles ,fears , pain , ego and many other emotions of a man trying to redeem himself and become significant in the world, but what really surprises is the ending that according to me is one of the most well thought out endings for a movie. The movie can be broadly divided into 4 acts , the introduction , the practice , the execution and the finale. The introduction begins with the director showing the type of life Riggan played by Michael Keaton lives , the present , his career and his troubled relationships with his daughter and wife. The director does a clean job in marking out the subtleties in their loose characterized bond with Riggan focusing on his Broadway play , his daughter trying to cope with loneliness and her need for drug use. The second act holds place exclusively for Edward Norton .A stellar performance by him ( for the second time in the year after grand Budapest hotel ). Norton lifts the already lifted show playing a character named Mike , an actor who believes he is a person with only a character he plays but no natural character of his own, more like water in a container taking shape of what he is placed in. The third act is where the movie falls short just a bit with the same story , and narrative dragging on with a bit pacing issue. What really stands out in the movie is the final act , the act that depicts ideologies of realization , self consciousness , self control , ego burst and perfection and as stated previously , an ending that truly makes a difference. The story does a brilliant job in touching concepts and showing the life behind the curtains. Story of actors struggling to act ,story of actors trying to stay in characterized control despite their real life emotional breakdown ,a actors striving to be significant , fights with reviewers and so on , a complete drama package.<br/><br/>The reason why i rated this movie 8 is mainly because the movie drags on a bit in the middle and a lot of characters are left out with little to no conclusion.<br/><br/>This is movie that is more of art, it's clearly depicted as Alejandro's playground of thoughts , his ideas , this movie is a painting whose beauty can witnessed more than once."
"Sploich","10","7","16","13 February 2015"," Review - Birdman (2014)
","Day one of Cinemark's Oscar Movie Week 2015 has finally arrived, and Birdman is actually the first of the eight Best Picture nominees I've seen this year. I've been sort of slacking off, but it's time to kick back into full gear! This is also the inaugural review for what I can only think to call ""Sploich.com 3.0"".<br/><br/>And ironically enough, ""rebirth"" is a major theme of my first review. Birdman is the story of actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), known best for having starred in the fictitious blockbuster Birdman franchise almost two decades ago. Since then, his career has dwindled to nothing more than a footnote in the history of film, but he believes his new Broadway show will change that. During the projection of his play, he suffers from schizophrenia brought on by his former cinematic alter ego.<br/><br/>Keaton's performance is downright masterful as he, to some extent, satires his own career. He brings to life a fascinating character whose existence has ultimately amounted to a question mark. He's on a journey of self-discovery while also knowing exactly who he is and what he's become. As you watch, you see the pieces of his mind fall in and out of place like balls in a bingo cage.<br/><br/>Riggan's condition is only made more confusing and dangerous by the people around him. His daughter/assistant Sam (Emma Stone) is a recovering user, his actor Mike (Edward Norton) is uncontrollable, and his lawyer Jake (Zach Galifianakis) is a constant reminder of what's at stake. The entire ensemble is fantastic, and it's great to see them all in such perfect roles with which they can showcase their talents. It's also great that Keaton, Stone and Norton all have been prominent characters in superhero films. I can't imagine that was by accident.<br/><br/>Maybe the most jaw-dropping aspect of the film, and one that can't really be portrayed in any trailer, is the fact that the entire movie is filmed as one long ""uncut"" shot. Obviously there is some clever editing involved, but that makes the experience seem all the more magical. It feels like you're watching a stage show, while never feeling any less like a film. It's a brilliant choice that I'm sure was a pain to produce, but the end result was absolutely worth it.<br/><br/>Director Alejandro González Iñárratu should be commended for his work, and not just because he finally made a movie that isn't soul- crushingly depressing. He decided not to take this story so seriously, producing a very dark comedy, and the result is virtually perfection. This movie is a film-lovers dream come true. The fantastical tone mixed with the real-world surrealism creates an experience unlike anything I've ever experienced, and I highly recommend you experience it as well."

","As a movie enthusiast (having in mind true qualities that make a film worthwhile when using this label), Birdman just DID IT. It delivered. It reminded me why i love films so much.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, it's hard to review this film to give it the credit it deserves, but here goes. Michael Keaton gives the performance of his life, you just gotta love him. He plays a washed up actor with his alter-ego-from-the-past torturing his mind and he portrays this brilliantly - every man's inner battle shown on film. Emma Stone is great also, Edward Norton, well, he's excellent as expected, and i'm glad Zach Galifianakis got his screen time, i think he's a great actor too.<br/><br/>The story is great, the music too, you'll see what i mean by 'music'. The way the movie is shot also blew my mind, Iñárritu is a damn genius. I'd love to say more, but don't want to spoil anything.<br/><br/>Birdman is the movie of the year and the one you just have to see, if you enjoy cinema. Frankly, it's one of the best films i've ever seen. It's entertaining, deep, makes you think, laugh... Birdman. Gravity doesn't even apply to it."

"rabeyaaziz","10","7","16","30 January 2015"," Film of the year? Try film of the decade.
","Birdman is such a powerful film with something to say that's worth saying which is rare these days. It satirises the slew of current Superhero/action films which are formulaic and say little and as Alan Parker rightly pointed out they are simply trying to compete with video games industry who have overtaken them. <br/><br/>Firstly on the film great casting. The film had to be Michael Keaton as the lead or it just wouldn't work - shame on us all for forgetting what a masterful actor he is. Naomi Watts whom I hadn't seen acting before also puts in a stellar performance. Norton was a mixture of all things comedy and tragedy and I liked the way he drifted out of the film with no real explanation – typically he would be 'fitted into a box' i.e. he learns something and changes or redeems himself - I'd like to think he' still a bit of an ass - but now takes a breath before he reacts. Emma Stone played her part pitch perfect. <br/><br/>The scenes that moved me the most were when he completely trashes the room - it really summed up how it feels someday when you have a mental health problem and brought a tear to my eye. Similarly when he wakes up with a hangover and walks down the street and his inner voice Birdman is castigating him and then he flies off in a dream like state - again I had a lump in my throat as its the scolding of that inner voice that rings true and that innate desire of wanting to free yourself from it was so delicate portrayed and beautiful. <br/><br/>Although questions arise about how biographical it is on Keaton's own life, I can't help thinking there are some parallels of course but not loads. I loved the way he jumped off the building giving a nod to him in His Batman heyday using the same fall with his coat acting as a cloak – a subtle nudge. <br/><br/>The deeper theme behind the film for me was one of loss. What it is like to be forgotten as a line in the play says 'I don't exist anymore'. Riggan wants' to exist. He wants' to be alive again – having his old life back as Birdman won't satisfy him, he wants to bigger and bolder than before and wants' to make a statement to the world.<br/><br/>Sure his ego is at play at here, but isn't that just human nature? When we hit rock bottom we want to show people that we are doing better than before now – and in fact are doing better than them. That brings a certain amount of satisfaction.<br/><br/>Although he is not a likable character as such and he has failings like any human – he doesn't as his alter ego says want to end up as an answer on a Trivial Pursuit question. He wants' to be admired, revered, respected, popular – who doesn't?<br/><br/>Thus sadly I don't think he ever can be and indeed ever does as he is too flawed to redeem himself – in short he is too far down the line. The ending given wants' to imply that all is well his ex respects him, his daughter loves him, the critics and the public adore him – again a ruse and an attack on Hollywood and their happy endings where everything is put in a box to satisfy test audiences. I guess the clue is that for such a schizophrenic film it does not deserve such an ending - and nor would it make sense. So I think the director is just toying with us here! Instead I believe Riggan killed himself when he tried to drown himself and the whole film is him imagining his life as wished it to be as he slowly drowns - perhaps that is the significance of the Jellyfish, his wife appearing from nowhere always wearing black. She isn't real – none of it is perhaps. <br/><br/>However, I would counter that by saying the ending is what you want it to mean. I think what is more important is what Riggan/Birdman are portraying about man and his struggle to be relevant as he gets older, and man with inherent flaws. The film has resonance - it has resonance in all our lives in some context if you look deep enough – I recommend watching it twice. <br/><br/>In sum, this film should sweep up at the Oscars and deservedly so ahead of Grand Budapest Hotel which is a completely different genre. The director goes to show that if people are prepared to back you when you take risks the possibilities are endless. Not one single actor in Hollywood would now turn down the opportunity to work with this director. <br/><br/>As for the reviews with 1 star that is a joke – its obvious it was never going to be your kind of film as you probably watched the trailer and thought it was some kind of Superhero film!"
"stephenknagel","10","7","16","29 January 2015"," Birdman is a black comedy with elements of magical realism, presented as raw drama.
","Riggan is a washed-up actor who tries to claw his way back to relevance by staging a Broadway play. <br/><br/>As he prepares, he's surrounded by crazy family, friends and colleagues in one big, beautiful surrealistic swirl. This film shook me to the core. Michael Keaton delivers an amazing performance in the midst of a stellar cast. If you're looking to go more meta than you've gone in a while, go see Birdman.<br/><br/>The most intriguing aesthetic element of the film is how it appears to be one continuous shot. Of course, it isn't actually shot like this, but the brilliant camera-work and editing provide this glorious illusion.<br/><br/>I love that Birdman is almost a nod to Keaton having played Batman all those years ago, making this movie more meta than what most people can handle. This unapologetic film asks bold questions about the movie industry and the people in it; making it a brilliant form of introspection for the cast and their peers. The main character, Riggan is a personification of all actors (the idea of an actor as a construct), caught in the purgatory between art and the spectacle.<br/><br/>I'd love to compare it to something else, but I really can't. It's such a unique piece of work.<br/><br/>Anyone can enjoy this film, except the blunt instrument. Speaking of instruments, the score is also absolutely stunning."

","I can't remember enjoying a trip to the cinema so much, this hugely entertaining theatrical confection is up there with ""Shakespeare in Love"" and ""Working with Orson"" as wonderful fantasy on a theatrical theme or a story woven around a theatrical production....I laughed out load, marvelled at the acting - every single character was hilariously portrayed And the music was outstanding....absolutely fabulous. What wonderful camera-work, beautiful, a real gem of a movie. I left the cinema feeling like I knew all these characters personally.

"rcolgan","10","7","16","11 January 2015"," Reminds us of the heights that cinema can soar to
","In Birdman's opening moments then we are introduced to Regan (Kearon) as he meditates in his underwear and levitating a few feet off the ground. It is a rare moment of tranquillity that he rarely gets throughout the film. But it is not long before the Skype alarm goes off and he is thrown back into a world that continuously mounts the pressures upon him as he tries to mount a stage show to revive his career and reclaim his former glory he had when he played the hero Birdman.<br/><br/>It is this lurking shadow that appears to haunt the entire film with his conscience acting as a dark reminder of how far gone his heyday is. As he looks to the sky he imagines soaring once more to the heights he previously had above everyone else in the world. On top of which he constantly tackles the fears that this stage show is going to be a failure and he no longer has a true place with the fear that he just doesn't matter any more.The film makes some interesting statements on both the current nature of modern cinema (with his thoughts telling him that all people want now is explosions and monsters) with the desire to be respected and validated as an actor but fearing he will never get this recognition he deserves. As these pressures build with the constant drumming that follow us throughout the film, we are brought to boiling point as we witness the pressures that past fame can be and the dark daemons it can create. <br/><br/>Iñárritu's vision of combining the entire film into what appears to be a single continuous shot is one of the most ambitious pieces of filmmaking in recent years. Just like any theatre production there is no chance for error with every actor, every prop and the camera movement having to work to be perfectly timed so as not to ruin these long takes. In spite of all this risk the film is carried out near flawlessly with all the comedic timing performed incredibly with not a single moment wasted in the film, constantly passing from scene to scene seamlessly. It's a mixture of technical mastery and cinematic genius that Iñárritu has used to create this masterpiece as through these shots he can switch from showing us Regan's reality before transitioning to beautiful and at times dark fantasies as the film blurs the line between the two and throws us in to the constantly shifting mental state of our protagonist as he longs to fly again to the heights he once flew. <br/><br/>With the long continuous shots there are many times in the film where the film focuses on nothing but the actors performance to guide the scene. Fortunately the entire cast were up to the challenge with every member of the cast giving a standout performance. Though it must be said that Keaton particularly gives the performance of a life time. Obviously Keatons background as the caped crusader and the many parallels between Keaton's life and the character creates an additional element of relevance. But what really makes him perfect for the role is how he incredibly matches both the comedic tones and the emotional hardships that the script calls for. Throughout every scene Keaton nails everything in the script going from a silly clown one minute walking merrily down the street in nothing but his underwear to becoming an emotional wreck questioning his entire production in the very next scene. The film clearly hinged on getting a spectacular lead and without a doubt they got one in Keaton.<br/><br/>Every actor assembled similarly gives a career high performance, with each deserving all the acclaim that can be given. They all handle the long takes in stride ensuring that every line delivers the comedic or emotional punch that the scene calls for. And the script is perfect at facilitating these masterful performances ensuring that each character gets a stand out moment ranging from Stone's emotional explosion as she tells her father that he doesn't matter to Norton fighting Regan in his underwear. Each character in the film is well fleshed out even taking the highlight off Keaton at points. <br/><br/>Dark, emotional and constantly funny, Birdman is astonishing. It's flawless performances mixed with Iñárritu's visually stunning style to create what is nothing short of a masterpiece that reminds us the unbreakable limits that cinema can soar to."

But I hope they will.<br/><br/>Its like a modern hash of Lost in Translation - but on speed. The characters and scenes are presented like touch points to the Keaton's character, who is propelled like a bird through storm to storm, to Tornado to Cyclone to something even bigger.<br/><br/>Its also a bit like watching a Quentin Tarantino production. The support characters are very strong, and creates a series of tense moments and scenes. You start to wonder... What's going to happen in this scene? Whats going to happen in the next few seconds?<br/><br/>The subtext about advantage of ignorance is also good, and works at several layers. As are the outrageous scenes, most of which are confined in the tunnels of a Broadway theater.<br/><br/>Its fast paced in many parts, with fast dialogue. So it can a bit hard to catch, for those not familiar with English.

"jafar-iqbal","10","7","16","6 January 2015"," A technical and creative masterpiece
","Take my advice and go see 'Birdman'. Maybe even watch it a second or a third time. Because, chances are, you're not going to see a film like this again for a very long time. Sure, there will be other great films, other magnificent films that are essential viewing, but films like this don't get made very often. So refreshing to see, in this age of cinema where everything is adapted or reimagined or sequelled, a film that is so utterly original.<br/><br/>On the surface, it isn't too different from your standard independent dramedy – twenty years after playing an iconic superhero, washed-up actor Riggan Thomas is writing, directing and starring in a Broadway play. It's the last chance he has to rejuvenate his career, but everything around him is falling apart. His cast; his family; his sanity; it's all going wrong. As opening night draws closer, Riggan teeters closer and closer to the edge.<br/><br/>You only need to scratch beneath that surface a tiny little bit to see that 'Birdman' is far from standard. Very ambitiously and very successfully, writer/director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu edits the entire film as though it is one continuous shot. The camera tilts, swivels and slides along in one seamless motion, either chasing after its actors or panning across rooms and storeys. This is not just a technical achievement (a ridiculously big technical achievement, mind) but a creative one. Ensuring it was a success meant the cast essentially working through pages and pages of script, requiring the highest levels of concentration and acting finesse.<br/><br/>But don't let all that fool you, this isn't just some fancy party trick – the cinematography does more to enhance the hysteria seen backstage at a theatre production than any montage ever could, and the constant movement of the camera is reflective of the central character's own ever-frenetic mind. Driven by fear, anxiety and pride, Riggan Thomas cannot stop. And the camera moves with him every step of the way.<br/><br/>As Riggan, Michael Keaton is simply superb. It's ridiculous to think that it's been four years since he last headlined a movie, and even longer since he got a role as meaty as this. To say he makes the most of the opportunity is beyond an understatement. This was a role made for him, and the metaphysical in-jokes (George Clooney's chin is a lovely reference) only add to the nuances. Riggan Thomas is a man driven by the fear of losing everything, and Keaton expresses it all brilliantly. The sharp script obviously helps, but Keaton's ability to emote just with his eyes, or a twitch, is beautiful to watch. Just like McConaughey, this could see the beginning of Ketaon's resurgence. I sincerely hope so.<br/><br/>Everyone else pitches in too, though. Zach Galifianakis' long-suffering producer; Naomi Watts' insecure young actress; Andrea Riseborough's frustrated girlfriend; Amy Ryan's exhausted ex-wife; they're all excellent in relatively small but significant roles. But of the supporting cast, Emma Stone and Edward Norton are a cut above. Norton is hilarious as the Broadway veteran, difficult to work with in his undying effort to find 'truth' on stage (mirroring Norton's own storied behavioural issues). Emma Stone, too, is just incredible. It's a character that starts off looking quite generic – young daughter out of rehab who doesn't give a crap about anyone – but she comes into her own in a big way. Stealing every scene she's in, including a fantastic final few seconds, Stone shows once again why she is one of the best actresses out there right now.<br/><br/>There are a lot of big movies coming out this year – your Stars Wars and your Marvels – but this is already a frontrunner for movie of the year. Technically and creatively, 'Birdman' is a cinematic triumph, and a brilliant way to start the year. If this is the calibre of cinema we have to look forward to, we're in for a ride.<br/><br/>So please. Go and watch 'Birdman'. And then think about watching it again."

","It's not very often I leave the cinema with a huge smile on my face. On one of my no drinking days - I simply had to go for a beer with my friend to chat through one of most original films I have seen in years. Birdman see's Michael Keaton star as a washed up actor who once played the world famous Birdman - a super hero, that in the 90's was a huge box office hit. Sound familiar?<br/><br/>Keaton's character Riggan​ is in the process of writing and starring in a new play to try and establish himself as a credible actor. Riggan though is plagued with personal issues, His wife has left him, his daughter is full of resentment for him after never being there for her and worst of all he is convinced that he actually has super powers. <br/><br/>​The film opens with a long tracking shot that sweeps around each character, after 5 minutes you realise that this is going to be the style for the whole film and cuts are disguised by tracking down a dark corridor or bright light. It works beautifully, you feel like you are right in amongst the action and connect with each character as the camera roams around the three or four locations the film is set in. ​ Overall the film is definitely one of the most intriguing, original and wonderfully acted films I have seen for a long while. Keaton is at his best as this self obsessed, depressed yet still likable character and is complimented by a fine comedic performance from Ed Norton. <br/><br/>The film is accompanied by a rather strange yet perfect soundtrack which is mainly percussion based. There are even moments when a random drummer is playing part of the soundtrack in the street! Original films are hard to find and this is possibly the most original and intriguing film I have seen since Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless mind. It's funny, a little sad, yet totally compelling and a must watch."

","I hesitate to even write a review of this movie. I feel that my inability to write to the standards of all the internet armchair movie critics out there may cause people to focus more on my (lack of) writing prowess and ignore the fact that this is an amazing film. In spite of my hesitation, this film moved me and inspired me to put my thoughts out into the ether; so, I guess I'll just have to take my chances.<br/><br/>I will start by saying that I think this movie reaches guys more than women. Not that it's necessarily a ""Man Movie"" but the main character is a man and the film is essentially about his struggle. Men will identify with it. I, specifically, identified with the character. Not because I've ever been a movie star or that I've even tried to challenge the world to take me seriously... but because I've had to deal with the humbling feat of dealing with, falling victim to, and eventually overcoming my own ego; as I think most men of a certain age have. <br/><br/>The depiction of Keaton's character realizing that his whole struggle of self discovery was really just his ego's way of tricking him, talking him into buying more of his own B.S. It was a kick in the balls to my manhood, as I saw my own failings and egocentric behavior in Keaton's. It was touching, heart wrenching, hilarious, humiliating, and uplifting to share in his experience on screen. Like I said... guys will get it more than women. My girlfriend like the movie, but not nearly as much as I. But what does she know? She's just a girl and has never been a movie star."
"bankofmarquis","6","7","16","25 November 2014"," An ""Actor's"" Movie
","BIRDMAN is an interesting ""actors"" movie that, I'm sure, appealed to the performers that agreed to appear in it. Unfortunately, I'm not too sure that this movie is appealing to much more of a population than that.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomas, a former star of blockbuster comic-book movies who is trying to make a comeback as a ""real"" actor by writing, directing and starring in his Broadway debut. He struggles throughout the movie with his own identity. Is he an ""actor"" as he likes to think he is, or is he ""just a celebrity"" as someone tells him - and does it matter? Ultimately, the last question is what this movie tries to tell us.<br/><br/>The ""gimmick"" of this movie is that it is filmed in one, long shot. (It isn't really, but it attempts to give us the illusion that it is). We follow Thomas and others throughout the St. James Theatre on Broadway and places very close to there (close enough to walk to). It's an interesting way of telling this tale, not one that I think helps the story along, and since I was aware of the ""gimmick"" throughout the movie, it might have hurt it.<br/><br/>I have heard Oscar buzz for Keaton's performance, and I just don't see it. True, it is GREAT to see Keaton back in a leading role and he acquits himself just fine, but it just isn't an ""Academy Award worthy"" performance or role (IMH0).<br/><br/>Because of the ""inside"" nature of this movie, I stated earlier that this would be appealing to actors and, I am sure, that is what drew such strong performers as Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough. They all served the script and the gimmick well with strong performances. Only Zach Galifinakis' agent, Jake, falls short for me. He just isn't in the same league as a dramatic actor with these others. It's fun to see him try, but he falls short, resorting to over-acting at times.<br/><br/>Director and Writer Alejandro Gonazlez Inarritu creates an interesting world, but I wanted him to flesh out the supporting characters more and rely on the gimmick less.<br/><br/>if he did, I might have cared a little more at the end as to what happens to Keaton's character. But, as it is, I didn't.<br/><br/>6 (out of 10) stars. And you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"

","This was one of the most masterfully crafted films I have seen in years. An intense drama masked by comedy; phenomenal acting from the entire cast, not a moment is unbelievable. Michael Keaton was top notch (his best performance ever in my opinion). Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is something to marvel in its self! The idea of following him day to day as one continuous take shows the sad nature to this characters world. Behind the comedy of this films world there is a very depressing nature to the film throughout. Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is haunted by his past superhero character, Birdman, and it's destroying him as a person. His greatest achievement has now become his worse enemy."

","What a great remarkable film. I had high expectations for it ever since I first heard it was being made two years ago and they were far surpassed. What a comeback performance by Michael Keaton. He IS the movie and the movie IS him. His performance truly deserves an Oscar. Actually, every performance in this movie shines. Norton was splendid and even Emma Stone surprised me with her acting chops (I'm not that big a fan of hers). The film feels like one long take from start to finish with some hidden cuts here and there. This is one of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's best works of art. The film is beautiful to look at. Thank you Alejandro González Iñárritu for your dedication in making this piece truly stand out. In my opinion, it's Iñárritu's best work. The time and dedication spent crafting this one shows. For sure he will get some recognition on this one. Got to give it to Mexico's big three filmmakers in leading the way for future generations. Iñárritu, Alfonso Cuarón, and Guillermo Del Toro are some of today's best directors."

The single-take process is captivating in places, most notably Michael Keaton's quite astonishingly long (though inaccurate and a tad contrived) lapping of the outside of the real-life theatre through Times Square, as well as the technically excellent long day-night shot of the environment.

The idea of making a movie that looks like one long shot is extremely creative, and they pull it off brilliantly. Unfortunately, that alone can't make a movie succeed. Keaton is good as the lead, and there are some interesting themes of success, loneliness, and ego but none of them ever shine through or are ever developed in a meaningful way. The ending was silly - how could he have missed and only shot his nose, why was Birdman so in his head, and how could the newspaper story have an impact on viewers?

"nsequeira-50288","2","3","5","3 February 2018"," This movie sucks.
","This movie is a bad movie, plain and simple. It is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through. It's two hours of nothing. Just nothing. It pretends to be a low budget art film, even though in reality it's just a big budget money- grabber trash film from the same guy who brought you The Revenant, a two hour snuff film. This movie is for people who want to seem intellectual without actually being intellectual. It is not smart, or funny, or revolutionary. Do not watch it. <br/><br/>First things first- this movie has Michael Keaton. That's sad. I like Michael Keaton. He's a good actor. The original Batman is one of my all time favorite movies. So for him to be cast in a sucker like this- well, that's just beyond my comprehension. Even more than that, it makes a mockery of him- portrays him as a washed up actor. This film is garbage on so many levels.<br/><br/>The film opens, just like The Revenant, with some incoherent hushed whispering, then we see Michael Keaton in a room, FLOATING- and we never see him do this again, for some reason- and it's never explained or anything. Then, we have one cut, and we enter literal movie Hell. From this point on, the film becomes so boring and dull that I wanted to switch it off. But I sat through it, like a prisoner chained to a couch- and I wish I hadn't. <br/><br/>My main problem with the movie is that it takes place in some insane alternate universe where, instead of Batman, there's BIRDMAN- who's totally different and a lot stupider, because he wouldn't be one bit scary to criminals, which is the whole point of Batman- but the world is exactly the same in every other way. Michael Keaton is the guy who played Birdman, and he's a washed up bum who's depressed and hates his life and everything. I'd love it if he was just in a new Batman movie or something. Or, maybe, he could be in a BIRDMAN movie- like, an actual BIRDMAN movie- which would be cool- instead of this boring movie about how they're MAKING these fictional Birdman movies. Why make a movie ABOUT MAKING A MOVIE? That's insane. There can be a movie about a washed up actor- but don't tantalize us throughout with clips and shots from a movie that would actually be BETTER. I'd watch Birdman. It would be cool. I don't want to watch a fake documentary about making Birdman. <br/><br/>And that alternate title has five long words- which aren't related to the plot in ANY WAY- but they're added on there just to give the whole trash heap a kind of pseudo-intellectual vibe. What a faker.<br/><br/>Anyway, after Michael Keaton floats around for a while in his room, the camera cuts- ONE OF ONLY TWO CUTS IN THE WHOLE MOVIE- and we start following his back around, through hallways and up stairs- like some kind of labyrinth- and his head spins around, and the cameraman wobbles like he's on drugs or something- just a very unpleasant experience. It's disorienting- There should be cuts in movies. This movie was boring in part because it's just like following somebody around for a whole day and observing what they do- and that's not exciting- I'm just glad they condensed it into two hours, instead of actually recording people walking around and doing mundane things for twenty four hours. I don't need to see Michael Keaton put on his shirt, brush his teeth, watch TV for a few hours- all in real time. That would be unbearable.<br/><br/>Birdman is not a movie- it's more a ""slice of life"" type thing. But the pie which the slice comes from tastes icky. The characters are unlikable- they're all big Broadway snobs- which I'm sure the pseudo-intellectual audience can relate to- I can just IMAGINE them eating their fancy crackers- And I couldn't tell any of the characters apart, except some were women and some were men. The camera just follows Michael Keaton around, and people talk to him about acting and stuff- and I don't know who any of those people are or what the heck they're doing. The one good part about the movie is that the singular long cut speeds up during the night, when one of the characters falls asleep- it doesn't stay there for twelve hours while she sleeps- that's nice.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton, in one scene (This movie HAS no scenes, it IS one big long scene) just walks around a table, that's going to be used in some play, and talks with the people about how the table should be used, and stuff. then the camera keeps following him around and up places and down places and into streets and along streets, talking with people. This movie is so boring that it has virtually no plot- just a man walking around and talking with people. I'm just glad it has some dialogue, or I could just stare at a wall for two hours and see exactly the same thing.<br/><br/>Now, there is one good part- and this is the only good part- there is one part where Michael Keaton is walking along, like always, and he meets his alter personality, Birdman, and Birdman does cool stuff like throwing cars off roofs and there are aliens and sidewalks blow up and Birdman zooms around and does cool stuff, and people fall out of windows and stuff, but then it turns out that the whole thing was just in Michael Keaton's imagination- he was just going nuts, apparently- then he keeps walking around and talking to people, like always, and the movie becomes boring again. That one event, out of the whole movie, made me clap my hands once. It also allowed me to come out of my coma.<br/><br/>The ending is the worst part of it all. Michael Keaton, all depressed from having such a boring, meaningless existence, goes crazy and decides that he's a washed up actor, and he jumps out the window, because he's crazy, and he thinks he can fly or something, and he breaks every fricking bone in his body and he's assigned to the emergency room for all eternity, and his life still sucks, because he can't fly like he thought he could.<br/><br/>Now here's the dumbest part- at the very end, he's just lying there, and I feel genuine pity for the guy who used to be cool as Batman- not because he's all bruised up, but because he's playing a character in a stupid movie like this when he could be zooming out of the Batcave- so he's lying there, right, and THEN, because he's so stupid, he decides to jump out the window again, the freaking lunatic, and he goes up on the window, and jumps out- and then there's ONE MORE CUT (The only cut besides the one in the beginning) and his niece or daughter or somebody related to him comes in (she's only there for family interest) and we don't see if he died or if he actually flew- she just looks out the window, and then up at the sky, and smiles, and happy little music plays, and OOP! There's the credits- and we never know what the Hell happened. Did he fly, or is he dead? Is the lady smiling because he's dead? That's pretty morbid. Really, though, I bet they didn't show him flying because that would have been too expensive- and they had already shelled out a billion dollars to hire a cameraman who was willing to walk around Michael Keaton for two hours and record everything he did. <br/><br/>This is a sad movie. It's not funny, or dramatic, or philosophic in any way, or inventive, or action packed, and it ruins Michael Keaton for me, to think he'd sign up to be in some shlock like this. Very sad. This movie was so dull- so lifeless, so void of human emotion- that it left me wondering just what humanity had come to in the end. Do people these days go and see movies just because they THINK they're good, even if they're not good? This movie is not good. It's garbage. Thank you."

With this movie you either love it or you hate it with a passion. People see a message I see nothing. There was no point to this movie. It was just terrible. I don't know what else to say besides that it was terrible lol. Definitely did not deserve the Oscar for best picture. Very disappointed."
"The Grand Master","5","3","5","11 July 2015"," Did this really win the Academy Award for Best Picture?!
","Birdman received a lot of critical acclaim as well as garnering many awards including the coveted Best Picture Academy Award for 2014. To be honest I thought this was one of the most overrated movies. Nothing against Michael Keaton (who makes a welcome comeback), Edward Norton (always reliable), Naomi Watts, Emma Stone and Zach Galifianakis (who looks great after shedding the kilos) who were decent in this movie, the story was just too arty and weird. I just didn't get all the critical acclaim about this movie.<br/><br/>Washed up actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton, Batman), who once played iconic superhero Birdman, is struggling to recapture his former glory as an actor by appearing in a play on New York's prestigious Broadway. In his debut on Broadway, he is appearing in an adaptation of Raymond Carver's story, ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". The only problems he must contend with include his ego, attempts to reconnect with his family including his daughter Sam (Emma Stone, The Amazing Spiderman) who is also his personal assistant, and salvage his career and himself in the days leading up to the opening of his Broadway play. The director of the play is Riggan's friend and lawyer Jake (Zach Galifianakis, The Hangover). To throw a spanner in the works so to speak, an on set accident during rehearsals causes an actor to be replaced by the talented but intense and extremely difficult Mike Shiner (Edward Norton, American History X) who is rubbing everyone the wrong way, including Riggan and leading actress Lesley Truman (Naomi Watts, Mulholland Drive) with whom Mike attempts to rape during a sex scene.<br/><br/>Birdman is interlaced with narration from Riggan's alter ego Birdman as well as visions of feats of paranormal acts. I didn't get as to what relevance this had to the movie. And for a comedy, I found it to be far too serious.<br/><br/>As I said before, I had nothing against the cast. The big talking point of the movie is Michael Keaton. In a case of life imitating art, Michael Keaton in particular showed he can show off his acting chops. He was big in the 1980's as a comedic actor but later kicked his career in another gear following the mega-success of Batman (1989). After the mid 1990's, Michael Keaton's career all but disappeared into mediocrity however he is slowly and steadily making a comeback.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be very weird and strange. I just didn't quite get the movie and all the critical acclaim surrounding the movie. I don't really know how this won the Best Picture Academy Award. I guess this just was not my cup of tea.<br/><br/>5/10."
"bobbobwhite","10","8","20","1 November 2014"," You will not forget this film
","A priceless film by director Alejandro González Iñárritu, a genius totally at odds with Hollywood values, and one not fearing to ask of his actors total truth and exposure and even madness to get at the bare and painful truth of the story. Michael Keaton plays Riggin, an aging actor famous for his Birdman character in a Batman-like, comic book movie from twenty years earlier. Washed up and broke, he now risks whatever is left producing and acting in an old play about love by a famous playwright he once met in a bar. The play is now rehearsing on Broadway, and Riggin is torn and thrashed at every turn by the play's production problems, his star actor's arrogance, his own past, his angry daughter, a vicious media critic, and most especially the insane voice in his head and his life-threatening fear of failure.<br/><br/>Director Inarritu, he of 21 Grams and Biutiful fame, fashions a film story unlike any director working today, more like a play than a film, with no ""movie star turns"" by any actor, with no one character overpowering the others, all working for and off each other for the best end result....the most truth in themselves and in the story. Keaton was an inspired selection for the lead considering that he once played Batman 20 years ago, and that he obviously had personal experience with a lot of the same emotions that Riggin felt....trying to come back, trying to overcome old and worn out fame, trying to prove that he was more than a has-been movie star. Riggin was also giving his life trying to prove to himself and the world that he could make it as a real producer/actor in the toughest venue possible....Broadway. He must prove it to himself... even after he harmed his chances by scolding a hateful critic that was determined to make his play a flop. Plus, as if more pain were needed, Riggin was a ""recovering"" alcoholic and an guilt-ridden absentee father to his resentful daughter who was helping out as a gofer. All of that impossible to overcome? Yes, perhaps, except for grace that the Unintended Virtue of Ignorance might provide.<br/><br/>Edward Norton and Naomi Watts were strong support, along with a great turn by Zach Galifianakis as Riggin's agent/manager/best friend, and Emma Stone as his daughter. Inarriti always gets such honest but tortured performances from his actors, and the result of that effort is a film that surely will be a future classic and is without a doubt the best film of the year to date. Keaton is a lock for a Best Actor nomination as is Inarritu for Best Director. The searing and painful truth of this story and its superb acting is what great and classic films are made of. You will never forget it."
"Ed-Shullivan","10","7","17","17 January 2015"," The cinematography is luscious with a very creative screenplay and mesmerizing musical score
","I left the theater feeling I got my moneys' worth, and as a result I have placed this film title on my ""purchase for personal library"" list. Why? Well I am not a big fan of dark comedies but the characters in this film, and more importantly the actors playing the characters were all top notch performances. I can understand why Michael Keaton would have received an Academy Award nomination for Lead Actor, and why he has already won the 2015 Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.<br/><br/>The film revolves around a depressed washed up action hero whose action hero character the Birdman made three epic multi-million blockbuster films some two decades earlier. After losing his box office drawing power Riggan Thomas (played by Michael Keaton) decides to invest his remaining bankroll and mortgage his Malibu beach home to write, direct and act in a Broadway play based on a short story written by an author named Raymond Carver. Carver had hand written a note and personally handed it to Riggan complementing him on his performance when Riggan was a young actor just starting out in the business. Riggan held on to that note for the next three decades in his wallet as a reminder that someone as famous as Raymond Carver believed in his acting abilities. So Riggan decides to muster up all his courage, talent (and especially his own money) to adapt his stage play based on Raymond Carver's short story that was written some 50 years earlier. Riggan will give his heart, soul and mind to direct and also act in his stage play.<br/><br/>Riggan's action hero character Birdman continues to haunt and taunt Riggan's mind by telling him he is the Birdman and must rise up and fly like he has never flown before and take the worlds evil doers on as he did when he was the number one rated box office draw. Riggan realizes that his mind is playing tricks on him and so he tries to suppress these images of the Birdman when it appears in his dressing room just before he is to appear on stage.<br/><br/>The stage is where we get to see both Michael Keaton's and Edward Norton's brilliance as ""A grade"" actors. Norton adds both humor and suspense to the film when he joins the plays cast as a late replacement for an actor that Riggan felt was just awful for his play. So Norton, who plays Mike, is considered a natural born for the stage box office draw agrees to join the cast after his live in girlfriend Lesley (played by Naomi Watts) recommends her boyfriend Mike to Riggan.<br/><br/>The business of operating the play is managed by a lawyer named Jake (played superbly by Zach Galifianakis). Jake also adds some of the the comedy relief to the depressing character of Michal Keaton's Riggan/Birdman. Jake is Riggan's oldest and dearest best friend and moral compass to keep the stage play financially afloat but Riggan's mind continues to waver as Birdman's character continues to make his presence felt in Riggan's mind and he continues to explode and make some bad decisions with both his finances and his career.<br/><br/>Adding to his personal turmoil is his ex-wife Sylvia (played by Amy Ryan) and his daughter Sam (played by Emma Stone) fresh out of re- hab who are both hovering around the stage and adding to his guilt of not being a faithful husband or present father.<br/><br/>So we the audience get to see if Riggan can survive his own stage play, his family guilt, his girlfriend, his new and brilliant co-star Mike, a New York stage critic with a nasty pen that has buried many a Broadway plays on their opening night, and of course can Riggan survive Birdman? I did enjoy this 2 hour dark dramedy more than I thought I would mainly due to the strong acting by this cast of stars and I will give credit to the director Alejandro González Iñárritu for maintaining a strong story line and captivating his audience. Mrs. Shullivan came out of the theatre stating ""well that was different but I did enjoy Michael Keaton and Edward Norton's performances"". It will be added as a keeper to my collection. Well done. I give the film an 8 out of 10."
"i_ianchev","10","7","17","7 December 2014"," Birdman acting
","I was expecting ""Birdman or (The unexpected virtue of ignorance)"" to be a blow up acting lesson, but it really surprised me with its completeness and universal message...<br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu really did it well. He is a proved and delightful author and director already, but this movie can really bring an Oscar to Michael Keaton. <br/><br/>But let's start with the atmosphere. The set is New York - WOW! I am really impressed how they showed us The Big Apple's artistic district. The camera work is incredible - long shots, beautifully transferring from one scene to another. The moving of the camera is flawless and alive. The viewer really feels the vibrant life of the main characters. And the music is very clever and fitting. Especially the rhythm and the pacing of the action are exact and provoke our emotional reaction almost every time. The whole setting and scenery is creative and true to the Broadway style life.<br/><br/>I must say that the main character Riggan (Michael Keaton) and Mike (Edward Norton) play almost perfect embodiments of how the modern actor's behavior. This encyclopedia of decision making and emotionally hazard behavior is tempting the viewer to feel empathy for them. I completely enjoyed their acting and felt that after all the American acting school is not behind the European at all. Hollywood may produce tons of bullsh*t, but Fox Searchlight has proved again its record of good production choices. And the acts in this film are really classical in a way. The falling out of glory struggling Riggan is investing his career and sanity into the play What ""We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". And we can feel the thickness of tension which is building up on his head. The reference to Keaton's actual career is evident, so we feel true empathy to the main character in Birdman. His alter ego - the Birdman is constantly reminding us of the Ego of every actor who has received appreciation, but is craving for more. And Norton's character Mike is truly an expected surprise representing the actors' boldness and ingenuity. The supporting cast - Zach Galifianakis (just wow!), Naomi Watts (the usual delved into character personality), Emma Stone and Andrea Riseborough add to the constellation of stars shining on the stage and on the screen. I must say - with such a cast a good director such as Iñárritu has done marvels of wonder!<br/><br/>Maybe I am too exuberant in my rants about this film, but I feel that we're witnessing really a piece which is close to perfection. I really enjoyed it very much and the true reason for that is the script. The story's both particular and general view for modern acting and the current condition of the cinematic industry have really impressed me. Every line is on spot, the ideas are not new, but are presented very fresh. One can only reflect upon the true nature and signification of the theater, cinema and acting as a profession and way of life. Yes, way of life. Because after all, depending on the situation, we all tend to act and react. All humans are actors in a way. And as William Shakespeare has put it eloquently:<br/><br/>""All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages."""
"drummer0913","10","10","27","22 January 2015"," Great until...
","If you've seen this movie, you know what I'm talking about here. If not, go watch it. It's a great piece for the most part but prepare to be disappointed. <br/><br/>Basically a deadbeat one-hit wonder/father/ex-husband (Keaton) who once posed as famous superhero, Birdman, struggles with success, relevance and being genuine. However he is poisoned by his alter ego (Birdman) who is self-entitled, lazy, arrogant and a devout believer in cheap thrills aka explosions, tits, guns, Michael Bay and so on. Of course Birdman is always trying to get in Keaton's head. <br/><br/>Anyway, Keaton decides he's gonna rehash an old story on Broadway as a last resort all the while juggling being broke, his daughter/assistant/former rehabbed, an uncooperative yet skilled actor, an ex-wife and a potential baby mama. Here's where it gets good. The tone of the entire movie just sucks. It's painful and dark and discouraging and gritty. I absolutely loved it. It spoke to me. The acting was awesome. Every detail seemed to reflect on how creating something new is really really hard. Because in order to create something new, you have to keep turning yourself inside out and be real with yourself... Which honestly, is a really dark place to arrive at sometimes. <br/><br/>So obviously Keaton was there. He was in that dark place where he had nothing left but himself and his feelings and it was all on the line. Everything depended on this play. Now to go into a little more detail on how Keaton attained his entitled attitude - Apparently some tough critic gave him an encouraging note on a cocktail napkin after a performance earlier in his life and he got cocky and hit it big with Birdman which only taught him that he didn't have to work hard for anything. Later on he discovered the critic really doesn't give a crap about him or his lousy arrogant pompous ambitions to direct and star in his play. Oh I forgot to mention by the way... In the play, he's a deadbeat who gets cheated on and shoots himself dead. Now during the whole movie it seems that the play (getting darker and darker each preview performance) intentionally reflects Keaton's life as a failure so you're kind of being led to anticipate his fate unravel as a viewer.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the middle of the film, Keaton succumbs to Birdman who convinces him that he is better than everyone else and all he needs is Birdman to be successful. He then becomes deranged and fantasizes about flying around the city like superman. Now the important thing to mention here is that the whole tone in this scene is mockery as I understood it. NOT wonder and excitement. Cheesy mockery of the terrible mega blockbusters filled with the cheap thrills aka Transformers, Avengers and so on and so forth. This to me was portraying a false reality. An escape from his pain that would last so long until leading him to his certain death (just like the play)<br/><br/>So here is where the film had led me. Keaton had two choices. Listen to Birdman and stay a cocky delusional low life prick, or accept his valley and work to the bones to get out. So of course he continued to partake in Birdman's flighty fantasies so obviously he was going to die right? At the premier of his show, Keaton was faced with being more genuine with his acting so he decides to use a real gun at the ending suicide scene. Now I realize that he looked and saw that the gun was loaded so I said to myself, yes he will finally accept the fate he has chosen. Come to find out, he wakes up famous with a nose job. <br/><br/>He'd become a spectacle because he shot his nose off... And succeeded? This is where the movie really let me down. The whole movie was all about not caring what people think and not becoming a YouTube hit or a spectacle. And yet, this was the ending... He became famous for such an ""artistic"" sacrifice. The movie was supposed to be about the heart of the aching city. Not some celebrity who shoots his nose off for attention and flies out his hospital window while his daughter giggles at the sight of it. <br/><br/>The strong and true lesson is this. Hard work is unseen much but highly recognized for lifetimes. A celebrity is a temporary spectacle.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it seems as if Birdman is just as ignorant as it claims to be."
"DVR_Brale","10","4","8","16 August 2016"," There is no single movie like Birdman - creativity and masterpiece at it's finest
","This is not going to be a classical review but the explanation of the movie from how I see it.<br/><br/>When I first saw it I... Got blown away. Totally. I don't remember I had ever had such fun before.<br/><br/>It's easiest to start with music so lets start with it. You'll remember that most of Birdman's soundtrack is only percussion. I asked myself why did Innaritu go with such simplistic music. If we understand Birdman as a satire to modern Hollywood and audiences, answer sprungs up. And it's this: modern audiences often take soundtrack for granted. People don't know how music really is important to the movie. We see only actors and CGI effects not appreciating all the time, effort and money it took in order for soundtrack to be made. Do you remember we actually see guy playing percussion (main theme) in two occasions? That strongly emphasizes my point: there IS someone working really hard in order to make soundtrack; but that person remains behind the curtain. His talents are not vividly shown on screen and are hence harder to appreciate. So, Innaritu decided to go mostly only with percussion because he wanted us to know that even the most basic music requires real talent and work, let alone sophisticated orchestral music.<br/><br/>OK, so I've understood Birdman as a satire to modern Hollywood and audiences. Let's analyze a few quotes from the movie to back this up. We'll all agree that Ema Stone shined as Sam. But what exactly is Sam's role in the movie? She says to her father in one scene and I quote: ""You hate bloggers. You make fun of Twitter. You don't even have a Facebook page. You're the one who doesn't exist. (...) It's not important. You're not important."" She's the one who thinks that being popular is what really matters. Her father had devoted himself to making a theater show which can't be popular as modern movies are; nevertheless, his show is no less art than any movie is. She represents new, modern audiences who sincerely believe number of Twitter followers or likes is a measure of quality. Let's now turn to one of the most important scenes which will shine much more light to the point I'm trying to convey.<br/><br/>So Riggan goes out and his bathrobe gets stuck. He can't come in or pull it out. So what does he do? He goes to his own show almost completely naked in order to act. What was he supposed to do? He's been working for this so hard! But as he walks on the streets of NYC more and more people start to take photos and videos of him. Ooo yeah, they're enjoying this so much! Much more than they would enjoy his show. His daughter Sam later tells him that he's made it. She has made social media accounts for him. Now he has thousand of followers and millions of YouTube views. That's what people want and that's what they enjoy! He has now climbed back to a level of fame he enjoyed when he was young. How crazy and fun you have to be it to walk the streets like that?! Oh, if they only knew the half of it...<br/><br/>But now, after that public stunt which Riggan didn't want in the first place comes the central scene - a conversation with a movie critic Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan). She says that she will destroy his show although she hadn't seen it. When Riggan asks why, she responds: ""You're no actor, you're a celebrity. Let's be clear on that. I'm gonna kill your play."" How many movie critics in reality review movies not objectively but with prejudices? She doesn't know he didn't do that public stunt on purpose but nevertheless doesn't even bother asking him about it. And there you have the dichotomy: people and his daughter on the one hand appreciate him but critics on the other hand don't. But that's tragicomic since he's not responsible for the fondness or hate! And furthermore Riggan doesn't care for the social media crowd but cares for what critics have to say. If they only knew the half of it...<br/><br/>And finally we arrive to a moment when out of nowhere a bird-like robot arrives and starts to destroy the city and kill people. Why, for God's sake, did Innaritu make that scene? Is it somehow beneficial to the story? No. Birdman doesn't have a story in a classical sense. It gives a glimpse into a world Riggan and his co-workers live in. The reason why Innaritu made that scene was because that's exactly what audience wants - action and mayhem. Not story; not philosophy; not some peculiar Shakespearean bullshit. We want action and cool stunts! Demolition! A moment before (or later; I can't remember) that scene we can see some homeless guy quoting Shakespeare. But people pass him by like he's not there. This two scenes put together form a nice contrast on audience and cinema matter.<br/><br/>This movie was shoot to look like one uninterrupted scene. That's because this way movie becomes very fast paced and very entertaining. All the acting is superb. Camera work is amazing. Birdman won an Oscar for cinematography as well. <br/><br/>And so we come to and end of this short analysis. I've analyzed only a few scenes in order to show from which framework should Birdman be seen - it's a satire to modern Hollywood and audience. And unbelievably clever one. And I've not even scratched the surface of it. There are so many clever little things put to it that make Birdman so thoroughly enjoyable. But I'll leave interpretation of those to your own reason and imagination.<br/><br/>If you've decided not to watch Birdman because it seemed obnoxious from the beginning, you've made the wrong decision. Don't expect anything and you'll see how good ""The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" is."

But this movie just seemed weird, the plot (was there even a plot? lol ) felt disconnected and It was dry and boring.

The Acting in this movie is just on a different level the most movies could hope to even be, i mean of the last 10 or so years i would probably put Birdman and Whiplash in the 10 for acting. Edward Norton is my stand out in Birdman hes amazing I forgot he had this in him it's been a while since fight club but he showed his true power in this movie. not that hes ever really done poorly but this was just something special. Emma Stone and Oscars will be something you start to hear a lot together in the future, maybe even the near future she showed off her skill in this movie just with her facial expressions alone. Michael Keaton gives a career best performance as well showing some range i never knew he had. Throw in a great supporting cast with great performances from Zach Galifianakis, Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough, and you have one of the best movies maybe of all time if not.. then surely of 2014. And its not that i think that the plot and story line are even that great, i mean they're really good but its basically a midlife crisis story about a recovering celebrity, that happens to have a great script due to some fantastic writing that meshed the comedy and drama so well.

"bryank-04844","10","4","8","12 August 2015"," 'Birdman' isn't just a film, it's an experience so magical and raw, that you'll be talking about it for months to come. Run, don't walk to see 'Birdman'.
","It's a very rare occurrence where a film changes the game on almost every aspect of filmmaking. From acting to camera-work, 'Birdman' literally soars above the rest where fierce emotions of erratic actors are put on display in a chaotic yet darkly comedic setting inside the St. James Theatre on West 44th Street in Manhattan. Not only do these actors turn in Oscar-worthy performances of the highest order, but director Alejandro G. Inarritu (Amores Perros) and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have given us an image so fresh and that pushes the bounds, that this is one of the most pleasing films of the year, visually speaking and unlike anything you might have seen before. Lubezki has worked with Alfonso Cauron on 'Children of Men' and the recent film 'Gravity'.<br/><br/>Now if you've seen those movies, you will remember that they were famous for having long scenes, greater than ten minutes without a single edit or cut (or at least it was made to look like that). Well keeping that in mind, Inarritu and Lubezki enhance that experience by making the entire film of 'Birdman' look like it is one long continuous shot, following the actors over the course of a few days. This gimmick is rarely used in film, mostly because it is very difficult to do and pull off well. Alfred Hitchcock pulled it off in 1948 with 'Rope' and Josh Becker did it in 1997 with Bruce Campbell in a film called 'Running Time'. But none can hold a candle to what 'Birdman' pulled off with this illusion of one long shot. It makes the movie that much more magical.<br/><br/>As I said before, the film takes place all in Broadway Theatre, leading up to opening night. The cast is lead by Michael Keaton, who plays Riggan Thomson, a washed up older actor, known for his big superhero films from twenty years ago, who is in desperate need of staging a comeback to become recognized again and to leave his mark on the world. Riggan went off the Hollywood radar when he turned down 'Birdman 4' all those years ago, and is now wanting the respect from his audience, critics, and peers to spur his ego once again. But Riggan will always know that he will forever be paired with his Birdman character, as he has a poster of Birdman in his dressing room and even the fictional character of Birdman talks to him as his psychotic alter ego from time to time as he walks through the theatre, getting stuff ready for opening night.<br/><br/>Riggan isn't making it easy on himself either, as he's chosen to write, direct, and star in this Broadway play, which is based on Raymond Carver's 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love'. He has hired another film actor named Lesley (Naomi Watts), who is making her Broadway debut and Laura (Andrea Riseborough), who is the on and off again girlfriend of Riggan. But when a bizarre accident leaves another actor unable to perform the role, Lesley wrangles her boyfriend, also a big named film actor Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), which will certainly sell tickets. Shiner is not the easiest person to work with and in fact makes things very difficult for Riggan and everyone else involved from, starting fights, trying to force re-writes, and even drinking real alcohol on stage rather than water during a preview that results in disastrous effects.<br/><br/>If that weren't enough, Riggan's daughter Sam (Emma Stone), who is if fresh out of rehab is reminding her dad how irrelevant he is because of his lack of commitment to social media and interviews, and not to mention his best friend and accountant played by a straight laced Zach Galifianakis who is constantly telling Riggan they have no money and that everything is riding on the success of this play. Inarritu shows us all of the inner workings of a Broadway play, from costume fittings to bursts of rage, fights, smoking cigarettes on the roof, to getting locked out of the bulding in your underwear and having to run through a packed Times Square to meet your cue on stage.<br/><br/>We see these aspects of a play, but there is something much more at work here, which is showing us how these great and respected actors are mere shells of a real person, void of any sane human emotion. While they may shine on stage perfectly, in real life, they can't figure simple things out like communicating on a plain level with one another or holding a relationship for longer than a few days. It's quite sad to see as each actor gives such emotional and real performances, that you can't help but sympathize with them.<br/><br/>The only thing that stuck out to me that didn't seem to fit in to this realistic setting was when the premiere New York Broadway critic tells Riggan that she will kill his play and give it a very negative review, even though she hasn't seen the play. Her reason is that he is a poser from Hollywood who is trying to deliver garbage into the New York scene. While I'm sure this happened more than fifty years ago, I'm certain it wouldn't happen today. But I get why Inarritu put it in there, which is to add to that ever growing tension on Riggan before opening night.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton is beyond excellent here. He gives a performance for the ages here and is highly deserving of the Oscar for Best Actor here, delivering on every chaotic and sweet human emotion on the spectrum. Norton is as always excellent, as is everyone else, particularly Emma Stone who plays a lost young woman searching for meaning and her father who has never been there for her. 'Birdman' isn't just a film, it's an experience so magical and raw, that you'll be talking about it for months to come. Run, don't walk to see 'Birdman'."

","First let me say that this movie is not cinematic!! It's a stage play that Alejandro decided to film. That said, the cinematic choices were very weak. After the fifteenth time following Michael Keaton (with a steadicam) through the dingy maze of theater hallways, or looking again at his or someone else's depressing dressing room, I longed to see something genuinely cinematic. There was a brief respite when Riggan fantasized about reviving Birdman as a superhero movie which was actually intended to make fun of tent-pole pics. I'm not a fan of tent-pole pics, but I am a fan of good cinematic storytelling.<br/><br/>In addition, since the story starts with Riggan frantically preparing to open a Broadway play, the audience never has a chance to connect emotionally with him. For ninety minutes, we see him freaking out -- Yawn. We don't care because we didn't travel with him to this point in his life. He alludes to his past in bits of clever dialog, but that's not enough to get the audience rooting for him to succeed.<br/><br/>Since most critics are primarily writers and most actors honed their chops in traditional theater, I suspect the high praise for this film comes from a segment of the entertainment industry that reveres the art of literary prose and barely understands the art of cinematic prose."

When there is no plot then actors can't do very much. I thought Micheal Keaton was awful along with all the other actors who were over acting. I could not relate to a single actor in the film. I kept thinking whats wrong with people who give out Oscars. I think they are old people in their 90's who have completely lost their minds. Whatever they cant understand they give it an Oscar. I hope the director and actors read this. If the screenplay was that bad , why did you choose to work in this film? You did not bring anything good to this film.

"aahari5","10","6","14","26 February 2015"," Modern Shakespeare at it's Finest
","Birdman Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is without a doubt the best film of 2014. Its original and relatable plot and innovative cinematography create an astonishing work of art and paints a vivid intellectual portrait of the desire to regain one's relevance and to prove their worth. The film feels like a new and refreshing take on the works of Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The films that I enjoy the most are the ones that I can relate to. Seeing Riggan Thomson as he struggles to distance himself from the schlocky superhero franchise that he is widely associated with and prove his greater talent as an actor feels similar to how I have progressed in life. As someone who faces very different yet all to similar challenges (i.e. depression, anxiety, learning difficulties), I have continually battled to achieve some degree of success and I try to accomplish my goals in spite of my obstacles. Perhaps the biggest question that is brought forward is how does one stay relevant in a changing society? Riggan struggled to maintain his popularity after leaving the multi-billion dollar franchise that made him a success and wants to stage a comeback though his Broadway production. He knows, however, that his play will likely be a disaster and that he will really only be remembered for his past role as Birdman. The message that I have interpreted from this theme is that true art, whether it be film or music or the like, does not usually get the wide attention that it deserves and that popular crowd will almost always be attracted to the flashier and more fantastical (but typically of lesser quality) fare. This makes a good statement on the superhero genre as well... it will either make an actors career or destroy it entirely.<br/><br/>The struggles that are faced in this film can be compared to Shakespeare's writings, particularly that of Macbeth. Riggan himself is Macbeth, ambitious and willing to go to any length to fulfill his goal and strives to prove his true artistic talents. Birdman, who inhabits Riggan's consciousness like a separate personality, is like Lady Macbeth, taunting and manipulating Riggan at every turn. Everyone from the critics to cast mates and even Riggan's own daughter have little faith in the production. The play itself seems destined to fail, but in the end, which I won't spoil too much, Riggan does succeed in some ways. How does he do it? Well, that is for the audience to decide.<br/><br/>Birdman's complex themes and amazing presentation form a masterpiece of cinema art and left a lasting impression on me as the viewer. The film could even have worked as an audio book or even as an actual stage performance itself. The film recently won several Academy Awards including Best Picture, and rightfully so. All of the film's aspects including its script, cinematography, and performances make it one of the best films in recent memory."
"Pouya_Mako","9","6","14","20 February 2015"," Deeply Dark and Perplexing, yet Funny and Enjoyable
","I want to start off with the fact that this movie depicts a very gloomy, painful and complicated travel into a schizophrenic mind, albeit it is marvelously seasoned with comedy to soothe the pain that the audience goes through. In my opinion, most of the audience would agree that the movie, theatrically speaking, is a masterpiece, if not, very close to one. However, the complicated representation of the content of the movie throws it into a debatable zone. Some argue it was a waste of time while others seem to have loved it sincerely. In my opinion, the movie was actually pretty much close to masterpiece rather than a 'waste of time' when considering both of its theatrical aspects and mind-boggling, brilliantly assembled story. <br/><br/>To elaborate my stance further, specifically on why I think the story is very well represented, I choose to concisely present a possible explanation to the ending that left many baffled and possibly is the main reason why quite a number of people hated the movie. In fact, there are a number of relatively equally plausible ways to explain the ending since it is a surreal story, but here I cite the one that, to me, seems more logically fit to the story.<br/><br/>~SPOILER ALERT~ *a possible explanation for the ending* <br/><br/>At the theater, Riggan shoots himself in the head and dies; what we see subsequently is a flashback to his own hallucination of what happens to him after he shoots himself. He hallucinated this probably sometime before shooting himself in the head. The references that make me think why he did not fail to kill himself in the theater and what follows is his hallucination of a perfect, impeccable aftermath, are as the following: 1- after the shot the body silently falls to the ground (as a 'dead' body does), 2- movement of the camera finally stops its continuous ""delusional"" motion and the suspense is made for the audience that the movie is actually going end, but suddenly the meteor seen from the beginning reappears (at the beginning after this instant he was seen hallucinating, hence, implying that what comes next is hallucination), 3- then the jellyfish is shown implying that he again failed his suicide attempt (note that the hallucination has begun at this point already), 4- in the hospital things are the way he wanted them to be, ideal to make him happy (Sam is weirdly nice to him, ex-wife stands up to his agent, and the three of them are seen together as he wished before he shot himself, moreover, surprisingly no one is even mad at him!), 5- no stitches or severe scars on the recently operated shot nose, 6- bandage that looks like the Birdman's mask, 7- clean shaved beard (right before he shot himself he had his goatee on, then in the hospital is a clean shave!) just as how he was when he portrayed Birdman years ago, 8- a phenomenal review by the stubborn-Hollywood- hating reviewer who had just sworn she would destroy his show, 9- the title of the review being ""The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"", which at the opening scene was suggested as another name for the movie, suggesting that the reviewer has realized she was ignorant towards his talents as an artist, but most importantly to Riggan himself ""The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" means that he surprisingly experiences a far better uprightness and goodness in his life without having any knowledge about his theater shooting's aftermath, 10- him having power over the ""Birdman"" who is finally under his control, 11- having a completely new look transforming him into a new legendary person that everybody loves and remembers for his artistic abilities rather than the ""Birdman"", 12- being famous in social media, this time not because of an embarrassing video, but again because of his art, 13- and finally gaining the ""real"" (not the delusional type) power of flying in a way that others can see him fly, which is implied as Sam who is surely not a hallucinate sees him fly, making him into a ""real"" superhero without the need for a ""Birdman"" but only himself, Riggan. In conclusion, in his hallucination at the end he has answered the very same questions typed at the beginning of the movie: ""And did you get what you wanted from this life, even so?"" ""I did."" ""And what did you want?"" ""To call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the Earth.""<br/><br/>As I have mentioned above, I think this is a fantastic movie because of its theatrical accomplishments as well as this kind of critical thinking that it requires for one to do in order to make sense out of the story. Furthermore, I hope my possible explanation of the ending can help some of those who were confused."
"bix171","10","6","14","18 February 2015"," Entertaining, Accessible, Rigorous
","Dazzling and imaginative, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's tour de force soars because this time around, he's less of a moralizer and much more of a philosopher. Inarritu employs every visual trick in his repertoire (the film's signature is that it seems unedited) but enjoyably employs them in the service of a fable set in a Broadway theater. The result feels refreshingly immediate, urgent; in such a setting, the questions asked feel worthwhile. What's really interesting is that the questions themselves deal with a topic specific to a target (read: educated) audience. Inarritu and his collaborators (writers Nicolas Glacobone, Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo) concern themselves with art and all sorts of questions related to it: why is it made, who is it being made for, how does it relate to the the individual as well as the collective? Michael Keaton, wonderful in a performance imbued with a gravitas he seldom draws upon, plays an action-movie actor attempting redemption by directing, starring and adapting Raymond Carver for the stage; in order to realize his vision, he must run a harrowing gauntlet consisting of an antagonistic, preening actor (Edward Norton, loads of fun), a relationship with a co-star (Andrea Riseborough), a daughter fresh out of rehab (Emma Stone) and a critic hell-bent on destroying him (Lindsay Duncan). Inarritu works with a magical realism (Keaton is able to use telekinesis to manipulate his surroundings and is responsible for some of the stresses that befall him) but the film, taking place as it does in a familiar setting, seems grounded throughout even when the open-ended (yet fulfilling) conclusion is just as magical; rather than the clean resolutions that restored the world in ""Babel"", here it's the individual, alone and detached from every surrounding antagonist, that makes a messy breakthrough and the result speaks to every member of the viewing audience. Entertaining and accessible but also rigorous, it's about time a film played to an engaged audience and not only to the multiplex masses. Kudos to Antonio Sanchez' brilliant drum score, which continuously yet subtly comments on the film's content."
"dany_n85","10","6","14","14 February 2015"," Spectacular, Unique, Intense from beginning to end
","What is a masterpiece in cinema? This word is often used when defining a great movie, but for a movie like Birdman this label doesn't even define its importance. From my point of view this is one of those pictures that comes once in a while and changes everything, it transcends every pattern you are familiar with, it seeks not to follow a defined path but to break all rules and create his own place in history. This is not a movie that lacks creativity, passion or energy, but a movie that combines them all to keep you at the edge of your seat from beginning to end. This is quite a feat for a drama/black comedy, where even the most entertaining action films fail to achieve.<br/><br/>The movie portrays Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) a former Hollywood has-been actor that turns to Broadway, desperate to be taken seriously again, to somehow salvage what has left of acting career, even though that comes to a question mark at some point when the NY Times theater critic Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan) refers to Riggan as being just a celebrity and not an actor. This phrase has more meaning than first thought, it's like a personification on today's Hollywood stage.<br/><br/>The camera-work is something quite remarkable, it brings a feeling of fluidity, an argument that acting, cinematography, the story, the characters, the music are all brought together and wouldn't be possible in its absence.<br/><br/>Acting is at its finest, none of the actors fails to deliver, with some surprising performances, such as Emma Stone, who at one point delivers one of those breathtaking monologues that cuts through like a sharp knife to the gut to all what's left of Riggan's self centered personality. Zach Galifianakis? Well who knew he could really act and still keep his funny persona. Yet, Michael Keaton steals the show with this one in a lifetime performance.<br/><br/>By casting Michael Keaton who in real life has played a similar role in two mega-grossing Batman films, directed by Tim Burton, and afterwards has found his career decline step by step to unknown brings a reality sort of feeling. It portrays a battle of a man against his ego, his past, his struggles to keep his family, his career and what's left of himself. It also evokes the seductions, fame and prestige for a man. There is a scene at one point when Riggan goes to his backstage room and breaks everything, erupting into a fight between his past glory days and the obscure present where everything seems to fall apart."
"markgorman","9","6","14","7 January 2015"," Unique. A challenging but hilarious master class in modern film making.
","It's as if Alejandro González Iñárritu and Michael Keaton have been on an unintended collision course towards the inevitable making of this art-house meets superhero movie - although Kick Ass managed to subvert the latter genre it only did so on a single dimension; this does so on multiple levels.<br/><br/>To even allude to it as a Superhero movie is, of course, to massively understate what is a film bristling with more ideas than a month-long sabbatical at Stephen Hawking's house.<br/><br/>It starts with the poster, moves onto the credits (the best I've seen for years) and then; scene one act one.<br/><br/>Every scene brings another ""how did he do that?"" in fact ""how did he think of that?"" moment.<br/><br/>In fact the scenic structure is the first big jaw drop aspect of the movie given that, essentially, scene one act one is all there is - it, arguably, never ends. Cleverly stitched together in the edit suite and captured by Emmanuel Lubezki the whole film is an homage to the ambitions of Orson Welles in his monumental ""El Rancho"" tracking shot from Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>Lubezki's camera prowls the dressing rooms, corridors and backstage areas of a Broadway Theatre endlessly, where washed up ex-superhero (the Birman of the title) star, Riggan Thomas played in a career defining performance by Michael Keaton is mounting a self- funded, self-adapted, self-directed and self-starring play of a Raymond Carver short story. <br/><br/>The trouble is; it sucks.<br/><br/>But after the weak link in the four man cast is nearly decapitated during late rehearsals, a big box office stand in, Mike Shiner, ((played magnificently by Edward Norton) takes his place the day before the first preview. Shiner may be a true star vehicle and 'box-ioffice gold' but his highly contrived method-acting is a massive pain in the ass and causes mayhem both on-stage and off.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, trying to direct the volatile Shiner plus his equally volatile girlfriend (more of a cameo but again brilliant by Angela Risborough) Keaton's character starts to fall apart, simultaneously haunted by his alter ego (the bird man that is embedded in his avian brain).<br/><br/>The action is relentless, breathtaking actually, as it is driven along by an incessant jazz drum solo that peppers the score.<br/><br/>Keaton looks and acts more and more like Bill Murray in his prime but his performance goes far deeper than anything I've ever seen Murray achieve (with the possible exception of Lost in Translation). It's dark, tragic and sensitive. <br/><br/>The awful relationship he 'enjoys' with his clearly disgruntled 'assistant' and rehabilitating daughter, Sam, played to scuzzy perfection by Emma Stone is remarkable. In one scene Stone berates Keaton for his inept fathering skills to the point that you genuinely think her head might actually burst open. It's electrifying.<br/><br/>As the frankly bizarre story unfolds more and more levels of pathos, black humour and tension are introduced; the pursuit of short term fame is brought brilliantly to life when Keaton 'trends on twitter' after an inadvertent stroll through Times Square in his jockeys. The veneer of fame and the dubiousness of acting ability - ""You're a celebrity not an actor"" sneers New York Times theatre critic played viciously by Lindsay Duncan in another notable cameo just before she sets out to crucify him: just because she can.<br/><br/>And we meet up with Keaton's superhero past an an entirely unexpected way.<br/><br/>The opening night of the play brings a denouement that I dare you to predict. <br/><br/>You won't. <br/><br/>You can't.<br/><br/>I've had my eye on Alejandro González Iñárritu since his debut feature in 2000, the heartbreaking Amores Perros, through 21 Grams and Babel and most recently the battering ram that is Biutiful. All these movies deal in big issues around the human condition. All break your heart in different ways and all are light, very light, in humour. So for him to create a comic masterpiece such as this is all the more disconcerting really. It has many, many laugh out loud moments but at its heart lies yet another big human condition movie. <br/><br/>How can one create true happiness in life when relationships are such fragile things in the world of celebrity? <br/><br/>What is art? <br/><br/>What indeed is fame?<br/><br/>As Andy Warhol said; we all have 15 minutes of it. <br/><br/>The trouble is, for many, the real stuff is like crack cocaine and we all know that's a hard one to kick."
"sxc_shabzee","10","6","14","5 January 2015"," A Meta-fictional Masterpiece
","If indeed you are unaware of the term ""Metafiction"", let me first define this for you. Metafiction self-consciously draws attention to the fact that what you are reading/ watching is in fact just that of an artifact. Questions are then created surrounding the relationship between fiction and reality, using self-reflection and more importantly, irony.<br/><br/>Birdman, in my opinion, is a great example of metafiction. From the outset, the name 'Birdman' strikes a unquestionable similarity to that of 'Batman'. Of course, most film buffs are aware that the lead role, Michael Keaton, played Batman in two films. Thus, whilst the film focuses heavily on a washed up old actor, famous only for playing a superhero- the film is adhering to the conventions of metafiction. The film, more than anything, is a challenge to our current generation. One that is self-obsessed and only finds joy in 'going viral' and building a collection of virtual followers on Social Networking sites. Yet, the people that don't quite get this film and heavily critique it are those that are being challenged by the film. Riggan himself as Birdman states that ""People, they love blood. They love action. Not this talky, depressing, philosophical bullshit."" and yet the film resonates closer to the latter. The film is extremely deep and symbolic and the three young boys that walked out of the cinema whilst I watched it are those that the director is challenging. <br/><br/>The film is a masterpiece. Everything about it is genius. The constant repetitive drum beats symbolises the monotonous nature of this current generation, the self-obsessed. Yet, Keaton plays his role perfectly. He is in fact the most self-obsessed to the point where his past follows him around and creates a voice in his head and a sense of superhuman powers, that are clearly not real or there to ""show off"" the camera techniques as some critics state, and yet he only finds peace in death.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the scene in Times Square was the one that stood out for me the most. The fact that, at only this point Riggan feels famous, (being in his underwear and filmed by hundreds) shows the simple-mindedness of this current era. Humiliation is the only way people are credited these days and as Mike Shiner states, ""Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige."" It is only when the public thinks Riggan has died that he gets the recognition he strives for, followed by Zach Galifianakis' remark that he finally got what he wanted. <br/><br/>Of course, bad criticism is always present for even the greatest of films but the striking irony of Keaton's desperate need for a good review is what this film is all about. Riggan wants his acting spark to be relighted and to be recognised again as a great actor. The film will be greeted by the unintelligent and mocked for not having enough blood or action, but the film is extremely deep. <br/><br/>The acting throughout the film is remarkable on all accounts. The cinematography is both pleasing to the eye and unique and symbolises that indeed, life goes on, and perhaps some of the actors of our youth are left behind. I can't imagine any actor playing the role of Birdman better than Keaton and if this film doesn't win at least three Oscars, then I have indeed lost hope in humanity. A true cinematic masterpiece that will one day become a classic."

","It's a bird, It's a plane, actually it is a bird! It's Birdman!!! And definitely one of the best movies of 2014. Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu's directed ""Birdman"" stars Michael Keaton as Riggan, an aging actor who had his thespian heyday in the early 90's playing an iconic superhero named Birdman. And do I have to hit you with a bat on your head, to discover the irony in this since in the early 90's Keaton himself played.... well, you know the rest, or at least I hope you do. Well, anyways back to the current Riggan era. Riggan is now in production of a Broadway play based on a Raymond Carver novel. He stars, wrote the adaptation, and is directing the play. It is here where ""Birdman"" flies with greatness as Iñarritu brilliantly sends us to the backstage Broadway theatre world, and shows us all its complex eccentricities and politics. Alejandro the Great also scribed up a very witty ""Birdman"" screenplay with co-writers Nicolas Giacabone, Alexander Dineralis, and Armando Bo. Michael Keaton was more than phenomenal as Riggan, and Keaton is deserving of all the award love he is receiving. The supporting work of ""Birdman"" also did not fly the coup. Edward Norton was spectacular as Mike, a feisty Broadway actor. Emma Stone was standout as Riggan's daughter Sam. Zach Galifianakis was superb as Riggan's lawyer Jake. Watts out, here comes another brilliant acting effort from Naomi Watts', here playing the emotional-wreck theatre actress Lesley. And other solid supporting work were delivered by Amy Ryan, Andrea Riseborough, and Lindsey Duncan. But this was really Michael Keaton's main stage, and he kept us birdwatching throughout his stupendous performance. My only minor flaw of ""Birdman"" is the one-too-many fantasy-like scenes, but that was just a minor mishap in the ""Birdman"" nest. So rise up and catch the ""Birdman"". ***** Excellent"

","The Oscar and film awards season has been a fun one this year, featuring one of the most intense Best Actor races of all time, but the sad thing is how many movies have disappointed. ""Interstellar"" was one huge supposed Oscar player that fell out of the race once people saw it, and the word right now is that Angelina Jolie's ""Unbroken"" won't be as big a player anymore. However, since about July there have been two movies that have stayed in the race, and at the front of the pack. The first being ""Boyhood,"" a great contender for winning the Best Picture award, and the second is ""Birdman."" So when I entered the theater I was praying this movie would be all it was cracked up to be. Let's just say it didn't disappoint. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton - an actor who used to be well known for playing the superhero Batman, but has since fallen out of the spotlight- stars in this movie about a man named Riggan Thompson - an actor who used to be well known for playing the superhero Birdman, but has since fallen out of the spotlight. See the similarity? In this film, Riggan Thompson is coming up on the opening night of his Broadway play which he has written, directed, and starred in as an attempt to reclaim some of his fame. As the play, and his life, begin to fall apart days before the premiere, Riggan begins to learn the difference between who he was, who he is now, and who he decides he's going to be.<br/><br/>Though there is a strong sense of irony in having Michael Keaton play a washed up actor in this film, his performance makes you wonder why that irony was even possible in the first place. Keaton perfectly plays the comedy in his timing, the dramatic pressure in his actions, and the sad truths his character faces in his eyes. Keaton is thick in the pack of Best Actor contenders for the Oscars which is exactly where he belongs. Edward Norton leads the supporting cast of this film giving a performance that proves his incredible acting ability and makes us sad he turned down playing the Incredible Hulk in ""Marvel's Avengers."" Emma Stone, who typically sticks to sarcastic comedy roles, finds new ground here that we didn't even see in her dramatic breakout ""The Help."" Though I love Emma Stone, I've always been skeptical of her dramatic ability, but here I was surprised in the best way possible. Zach Galifianakis and Naomi Watts also head up the incredible balance of comedy and drama that was featured in this movie.<br/><br/>In this world, there are two types of art.<br/><br/>Let's say you walk into an art museum and see a Picasso. The colors are vibrant, the geometry is fascinating, and the techniques are entirely unique. People gather around this painting with you to marvel at the decisions this visionary artist made and the perfection created on the canvas. You tell yourself you're happy you got to see such a famed and outstanding piece of art, then you leave the building and hop in your car to go home. As you're driving home you flip on the radio to keep yourself from falling asleep. A song you've never heard before, but you really like, comes on and you start jamming all the way home. You get home and your friend is there. He asks you how your evening was, and you tell him all about the Picasso you got to see. Your friend is really interested so he hands you a pencil and a piece of paper and he tells you to sketch the Picasso for him. You look at him like he's silly, but he urges you, so you hesitantly pick up the pencil. That's when you realize that you can't remember exactly what it looked like, so you set the pencil down. Your friend then asks if you've heard any good music recently, so you tell him about the one you heard in the car. He asks you to hum it. Piece of cake.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" is a great film. The actors are outstanding, the score made up of solo percussion is a genius idea, and the technique to make the film appear as a single take is not only successful but adds to the film as a whole. However, when the credits of this movie finish and you hear the last drum beat, the movie and everything about it comes to a complete end. This movie was hilarious, dramatic, and practically perfect in every technical way. ""Birdman,"" was a Picasso. This movie was absolutely outstanding, but the only thing I was able to take away from it was a couple funny lines.<br/><br/>""Birdman,"" like a Picasso, was a technical masterpiece and the combination of that and how well reviewed it was resulted in me liking this movie without even thinking about it. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu made the choice to give ""Birdman"" an alternate title. That title is: ""The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance."" I think that fits perfectly.<br/><br/>I give ""Birdman"" an 8.5/10."

",". . . is the main theme of the current release, BIRDMAN. A wonderful spoof of Broadway, BIRDMAN updates that old ""Things go better with Coke"" ad line for the 21st Century to ""things go better with guns."" In a week where many at the Real Life aggrieved shooting site high school in Washington state are tweeting that the shooter ""was just a misunderstood angel,"" BIRDMAN deftly captures the zeitgeist of today by showing that guns are the answer to many of America's pressing problems, whether you're talking Ebola, borders, or Broadway critics. But there's good news and bad news on this front. The good news is that we already have more than one firearm per capita in private hands. The bad news is that they're unevenly distributed. When Ed Norton makes fun of Michael Keaton's original stage gun in BIRDMAN and orders him to get another one, I was very worried. Keaton's BIRDMAN character did not seem to have the wherewithal to pick up a decent replacement weapon. In a typical Hollywood ending, however, he finds a serviceable six shooter on the top shelf of his dressing room just in the nick of time. Unfortunately, in Real Life, many poor Americans do not benefit from such a Deus Ex Machina. Last month the United Nations ordered the city of Detroit--bankrupt because most have not paid their water bills in decades--to turn the spigots back on since ""free water is a basic human right."" Well, our Declaration of Independence says the same thing about guns in the second paragraph, so please support your local chapter of BANGS (Broke Americans Need Gun Stamps) today!

This takes a whole new low to Hollywood narcissistic egotism and was disgusting to watch. The entire plot could easily be guessed within the first 5 minutes.<br/><br/>In case it wasn't enough to entirely feed off the system of Hollywood egotism, the director leaves a ""surprise ending"" which is supposed to leave you hanging. It is a pathetic cheap trick playing off the idea portrayed against the common media's reflection of Hollywood hogwash that is commonly prodded throughout the movie. What I can't comprehend, however, is how the critics are so acceptable of this continual prodding as an acceptable movie plot.

Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that they are sure whether they are the cat or the mouse..."
"poe426","1","5","11","19 March 2015"," Pretentious, amateurish scenery chewing...
","In high school, we staged plays like the one Michael Keaton's character puts on in BIRDMAN; they were just as bad, just as forgettable. Prior to his turn as BATMAN, Keaton starred in two very memorable films, THE DREAM TEAM and CLEAN AND SOBER. Both movies showed that his casting as The Dark Knight was inspired and not the evidence of Tim Burton's madness that many had proclaimed. Keaton's choices following BATMAN weren't as shrewd: though he had his pick of parts, he seemed to be trying to distance himself from The Caped Crusader. In so doing, he boxed himself into corners. In BIRDMAN, which is about as pretentious a movie as anything I've ever seen, his character does as Keaton did, with predictable results. Predictable? Clichéd to the Nth Degree is more to the point- and the hand-held camera trailing along behind him adds absolutely NOTHING to the film; it simply becomes TEDIOUS after an all-too-brief time. Like the aforementioned high school plays, BIRDMAN is Amateurish to an embarrassing degree- and whoever ""wrote"" this one needs to learn HOW to write; that's the worst aspect of all. BIRDMAN is, to put it simply, for the Birds."
"Fluke_Skywalker","5","5","11","8 March 2015"," The whole is less than the sum of its parts
","'Birdman' is a film practically bursting at the seams with audacious style, sly wit and wonderful performances. So it's curious that it all adds up to a film that I can't even say that I liked. I suppose the blame lay with director Alejandro González Iñárritu and his refusal to budge even an inch. He had a vision, and that vision's first victim was convention.<br/><br/>'Birdman' is a frustrating and exhausting film whose excesses ultimately overwhelm its many virtues and turn a potentially brilliant film into nothing more than an edifice to artistic ego leaving us to ponder wistfully at what might have been."
"net3431","4","5","11","26 January 2015"," Good Acting, Bad Screenplay
","If you are looking for a dark superhero drama, this is not it. Better to see Watchmen (2009). This is more of a soap opera about Broadway. It's not funny like Twentieth Century (1934); it's incoherent and boring. It's emotionally shallow. It's a depressing slow motion descent into madness, the effect being that of a lousy French art film. The acting is good; the camera work is amazing; but none that that can ransom the terrible screenplay. <br/><br/>I think the Birdman is a character that has great comedic potential, especially in a dark comedy. I think maybe this movie began its life as a dark comedy and was transformed by a pretentious little mind into a cynical, forgettable drama about a Broadway play that is so uninteresting we get to see almost none of it."
"apo1978","8","5","11","9 January 2015"," Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's Michael Keaton's awesome performance...
","Michael Keaton plays a washed-up actor, best known in his heyday as the star of the ""Birdman"" comic-book films, now trying to rejuvenate his name by writing, directing and starring in his own play on Broadway. From the opening beats (literally), I was transported into the fragile psyche of Riggan Thomas - a mind haunted by former glories and struggling to atone for a failing career, a failed marriage and an estranged daughter. The film is cleverly shot to seem as one long continuous take and unravels much like a play in itself. We meet the supporting characters, most notably an ego-obsessed actor (a superbly funny Edward Norton) and Riggan's angst-ridden daughter (a convincing Emma Stone) as he struggles to balance them all and himself while preparing for the play's opening night. Norton, Stone and the rest of the great cast (including Naomi Watts, Zack Galifianakis and Andrea Riseborough) are all on fine formbut this is Keaton's show. With ironic symmetry to his own career (I'm sure I don't need to remind you he was once Batman and a much bigger name 20 years ago) he gives Riggan a very personal touch, which may have or may not have been intended. A character desperately trying to escape his own narcissism, is given a brutally honest, captivating and heartfelt performance. The film may be a left field, almost avant-garde for some - it's not for your average popcorn muncher – but its' a highly refreshing experience. Just don't go in expecting a superhero film. Birdman is quite the opposite."

","(80%) Cinema and theatre combine in this oddball mash-up flight of fancy that results in something quite unlike anything else out there. It's also something that is really hard to know exactly what to make of it in just one viewing, but the fact is that I enjoyed it enough to happily sit through it again. In fact it may be brilliant and I simply haven't realised it. Only time will tell. But in the mean time this is a wonderfully assembled comic drama with brilliant one take direction that needs to be seen to be fully believed (even if you can spot the joins), the amount of work that must have gone into it is unimaginable. The writing, despite the story not being what one would call overly substantial, is razor sharp; and as everyone who's seen this already have thus far said, the acting throughout the entire cast is outstanding. This has its sights set on the jugular to many different aspects of the entertainment industry, from the differences of attitude in stage and screen; with critics getting a good roasting, which is both fun and brave. If you want something smart, unique, with solid lumps of pure gold quality added in every corner, then this is an enjoyable, very quirky must watch."
"tkubas1","8","5","11","18 November 2014"," One of my favorites this year
","Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance is an amazing callback to the likes of Hitchcock, Kubrick, and Scorsese. The standouts of the movie are the long takes and directing skill. The performances are multi layered and cool. Everything reeks of an art house tone and quality. <br/><br/>The move is about an actor played by Michael Keaton that is famous for playing a superhero; Birdman. He is tired of his reputation as a celebrity and wants to be recognized as an artist. His passion project is a play which he wrote, stars in, and directs. He pours all of his money and time into making it as good as possible. The story follows the actors in the play and the time up to opening. Keaton brings a performance like I've never seen from him. If all you've seen of his work is Batman you will no doubt be impressed. I personally was very surprised. From scenes were he's an actor playing an actor that acts in a play, to a hilariously funny fight with Edward Norton's character he constantly impressed me. Every scene that follows him with a tracking shot was implanted in my memory. One aspect of his character that I like was that he might possibly have super powers and it's left up to the viewer to decide. I love a character with multiple layers, and Keaton showed me that he either always had tremendous chops or he developed them in a hurry. He himself said it was his most difficult role, and I don't doubt it. Another actor that blew me away was Edward Norton. I'm not exaggerating; I think it was one of the best Norton performances. He plays an actor that has to fill in for an injured actor in for Keaton's play. As soon as he comes in for his first rehearsal he adds a new depth to the play. He plays an extreme method actor. Real emotion and real alcohol are essential for him to be at peak performance. His back and forth dialog with Keaton as they refine the script and their on stage chemistry is incredible. It felt like I, the viewer, was getting an inside look at the acting process. No matter how realistic or exaggerated that scene was I loved it. Norton is a lock as my pick for best supporting actor this year. Another stand out cast member was Emma stone. She plays Keaton's troubled daughter who seems to hang around the theater when she's not getting into trouble. Her big, bright eyes light up the screen. She has a really good scene that is close up on her face as she delivers a one take deconstruction of Keaton's character, yelling with ferocity I didn't know she had, she convinced me she could act then and there. I was never thinking of Gwen Stacy when I saw her and that's a good thing because her character is nothing like Gwen. She deserves any praise she gets. The rest of the cast like Naomi watts, Zack Galifianakis and Andrea Riseborough were all good. The cast as a whole can't be rivaled this year in the quality of acting displayed on screen. <br/><br/>I opened with a comment referencing Hitchcock and I did so because the movie calls back to one of my favorite Hitchcock movies, Rope (1948). In Rope, Hitchcock filmed the entire movie in four to ten minute takes (because the film roles only went up to just over ten minutes) with editing tricks to make it look seamless. In the same way the director of Birdman (Alejandro González Iñárritu) wanted to make the entire film seem as though it was filmed all at once with no breaks. Iñárritu cleverly used special effects to pull it off. This style makes the movie like nothing you've seen before. Even when the scene advances to the next day the camera tilts up to the sky and then comes back down appearing to have never missed a beat. Visually, the way the movie moves could be tiring to some people because it forces the viewer to pay attention at all times. For me, after about ten minutes I got used to it. The movie spoils you with tracking shot after tracking shot. The directing is very good and I think, deserving of an Oscar.<br/><br/>Over all you can't go wrong with this film. It has everything a movie fan could want and more. You have to think about what you're watching, and you may get something new each time. I would highly recommend you see it for its acting and directing accomplishments."

","It is not a usual drama full of dialogue or a superhero film, but the way that the screenwriters manipulate to present the whole story is surprisingly stunning.

This journey of crisis, transformation, battling of stressful emotions and the inner powerful demon of himself are well played by Michael Keaton, thanks to the strong and loud jazz drum scores as well as magical, thrilling, ambitious style of delivering by Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu. The mind blowing and overwhelming development might make the audiences to feel that this film about art and life is imitating Nolan's style of cinematography, but the ambiguous ending has rather more complex which gives the opportunity to the audiences to decide whether to end it positively or negatively."

","I can totally understand why this movie does not attract universal appeal. The entertainment is concealed within the story and figuring out your personal interpretation of what it represents - and that I acknowledge may be nothing much but it'll take some time to get there and perhaps several screenings.<br/><br/>Many directors at some point pay homage to their profession (Once upon ATI Hollywood, 81/2, The Player, Hail Caesar etc) and this could be Inarritu's. On one level it is about acting and the debate about whether theatre or film requires the most skill/talent or whatever.<br/><br/>The cast are first and foremost players within a film about a play - explaining as some have commented the stilted performances; trying to carry to the person seated in the balcony. To reinforce this there are limited cuts - like acts in a play. The players have to remember pages of script and learn stage markers.<br/><br/>To further compound there are the casting ironies; Keaton as the super intense over energised charachter that we know so well (which he says is most unlike him ahem!) and Norton playing the script finagler that we are lead to believe that he is. Plus their prior roles as superheros brings a biographical element to their casting along with emma from Spiderman and Naomi possibly extending the role of Betty/Diane from Mulholland Dr.<br/><br/>Two hollywood characters feeling they need to play the boards to be truly recognised in the eyes of their profession and another who feels that's the last place he needs to be to act (or live - for him real life is acting). A critic who can make or break a play describing ""hollywoods"" as celebrities. Does this set the scene for where we are about to be asked to be sympathetic? Plus there is a certain air of disdain around the achievement of ""Birdman""; ""Directing and starring in your own play? That's ambitious"".<br/><br/>Overlayed on this is human frailty of wanting to be respected and already having been venerated as a larger than life character who was approached with such intensity that the actor became him (at the cost of family) including those in this case imagined, superhero gifts.<br/><br/>With the approach of personal, professional and financial failure that not even these gifts can overcome the only option to change this scenario is to die on stage; gain professional attention, legendary status and avoid the sting of failure.<br/><br/>Was the end a death dream or homage to the superhero industry where no injury is too great that it can't be overcome and where the hero gets to fly away and fight another day or was the whole thing a play about a play after all... its left up to you.<br/><br/>Intriguing story within a story within a story, great script, clever casting and brilliant acting.

","""Birdman"" is one of those films that's entertaining when taken literally, but fascinating when taken thematically.<br/><br/>This is a dark comedy that explores the battle to remain relevant in the acting industry. It even manages to satirize how most people just want entertainment (blockbusters) instead of philosophical thinkpieces (everything the Academy nominates) while even snagging the Best Picture Oscar. But one of the themes in the film that really hit me (due to the performances from Michael Keaton and Emma Stone) was how constantly trying to become famous may start to alienate people. This is shown by the protagonist's strained relationship with his daughter.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton's performance was absolutely great. He really gave his character a damaged feel, since he's trying to struggle between being Riggan Thompson and Birdman. I've never seen Keaton like this before, and I loved it.<br/><br/>Emma Stone's performance was also really good. Although she was a supporting character, she did provide some of the film's dark humor, as well as some emotion (due to some of her dialogue). This really showcases her talent, and I'm glad she won an Oscar the year after (despite her performance not being THAT good in ""La La Land"").<br/><br/>A lot of people talked about how the majority of this film looked like one continuous shot. And I've got to say, even though I know that this WASN'T true, it really looks like it was one shot. <br/><br/>This film had quite a bit of dark humor, and it all really worked. <br/><br/>One thing that really surprised me was the characters' parallels to the actual careers of some of the actors. Most notably is Michael Keaton, where he's been trying to get past his success as Batman and try to be taken seriously; this is strongly represented in his character in the film, who is trying to get past his success as Birdman and try to be taken seriously. Another one is Edward Norton's character. In real life, Norton is known for being a method actor who is extremely hard to work with; in the film, Norton plays a method actor who is extremely hard to work with. Coincidence? I think not.<br/><br/>I know that this is a Best Picture winner, but I haven't always had good experiences with those. I loved some (""The Godfather"", ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""No Country for Old Men"", etc.), but then I didn't really like others (""Argo"", ""The Godfather Part II"").

I recommend this movie to everyone and I think this movie is the best film of 2014. I give this movie 10/10"
"cgourlay-33227","10","2","3","21 September 2017"," Very fantastic.
","Birdman (2014) is one of my favourite movies in the last 5 years. It is an ambitious film that shines due to its fantastic cast, score and crew. The director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu, really caught my attention with this movie and I'll have to watch more of his work in the future. The plot of the movie depicts an actor (Michael Keaton) who used to play a superhero but quit to pursue a career on stage. He has written a play that he hopes could put his name back on the map and the film depicts his struggles with bringing it all together. As well as this he suffers from a schizophrenic-esque problem that gives him continuous grief at crucial moments. All this sets up for a decent movie, but what really makes it special, and I'm sure anyone who has seen it will know what I'm about to say, is the way it is shot. The whole movie is filmed and edited so that it seems as though it is one continuous shot, no cuts, like a play. There are obviously cuts in places but you have to look for them to find them. There are scenes that go on for nearly 10 minutes without any cuts which are really impressive once you start to consider how difficult it would be to maneuver the crew and all their equipment as well as the actors not messing up once. The amount of effort put into this movie is very encouraging for the future of cinema and is a really refreshing watch. Another good part is the score, which is just a continuous drumbeat which really keeps you on edge the entire time. Anyway, would I recommend this movie? Of course. I would say this is a must see and so far my favourite movie that I have reviewed. It's not just a film, it's an art piece and if you don't particularly like film or appreciate it, this should change your mind. I'm giving it a 10/10."

"zlogdan","4","2","3","29 June 2016"," Pretentious
","This movie is a twisted emulation of ""nouvelle vague"" films, created by a wannabe director whose pretentious tones made this movie even more ridiculous than its premise which is basically to criticize the modern entertainment film industry, which we know is fairly well known by its excesses.<br/><br/>The director aimed to emulate one shooting type of film perhaps to make a homage to Goddard's mannerisms( or should I say inflated ego ?) and preference for unsteady cameras. The dialog between characters are utterly boring and lack cohesion and make abusive use of improvisation, after all, a film is a project of real life.<br/><br/>For those that enjoy the uttermost boring and insipid type of story telling, a.k.a modern pseudo-artsy which is promoted by independent film producers this is a rattling must see film which is only saved by good actors- all of them - and the percussive soundtrack which succeeds as a art product to be applauded at least."
"Horror-yo","5","2","3","17 May 2016"," Highly insufficient
","People are easily impressionable. All you need to do sometimes is come up with lots of flash, even if the substance doesn't follow. The cast is good, and seeing Keaton again, a quite particular actor, playing a lead role in a major production is very endearing. Emma Stone plays very well, surprisingly. The cast is globally strong, with Norton and Watts, two very good actors, as mere seconds here. Technically, the cinematography is very detailed and constantly sought after, and unfortunately that's where all the people fall into the obvious trap. The film has substance, but not a whole lot, not anything that hasn't been done a bunch of times before, and although it makes for a good viewing, the absence of a strong morality or even conclusion at all sinks this one. It's a fine, eventful movie, but it's not even close to masterpiece territory like lots are implying or outright saying. And the ending tries hard to be poetically abstract but really doesn't mean much (AND is taken from another film)."
"edwagreen","6","2","3","1 August 2015"," **1/2 More Like Bird Brain
","Despite the phenomenal acting of Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, this film brings a new definition to the word quirky. It deals with a has-been movie actor attempting a comeback via a Broadway production.<br/><br/>It seems that the cast is normal when they act out the play on stage and then revert to all sorts of bizarre behavior, neurotic behavior and other nonsense in the dressing rooms of the theater they are performing at.<br/><br/>It goes to show the frustration of acting and alter egos taking over. It is also shows the power of critics, in this case, the woman critic who though she hasn't seen the play, plans to demolish it with a scathing review, as she feels that Keaton and his brew lack artistic talent.<br/><br/>The ending is sad, but in life, such things can very well happen, especially when we are dealing with neurotic characters. Amazing to me that the motion picture academy chose to reward this neurotic mess with a best picture Oscar."

"caramia2002","10","1","1","30 September 2019"," Watched it Unaware
","That it was all in such long takes with so little editing. Thus I forgive the tiny foibles. What an achievement. I first watched this after it came out on home video and I guess I must have put it on right before bed or something, because I couldn't really remember it and thought it had a boring Hollywood fake plot device (silly comic action) when Riggan gets locked out. That might have improved the 1star reviews, sadly. I was entranced the entire time, and was sad when it ended. Bravura performances by many and why I love Inarritu as a director.<br/><br/>I am so glad that Michael Keaton got to show off his considerable acting talents in such a manner. I have loved him since the beginning and have never quite forgiven him for taking on the Batman movies, although he was astonishingly good in what little I saw of Batman. All of the cast was amazing; this is far and away the best I've seen Ed Norton perform. Lindsey Duncan made a lasting impression and she was only in a couple scenes. I didn't care too much for whomever played Laura, the girlfriend. She never seemed to connect with the screenplay or direction, which is a bit forgivable as this film wasn't made in the usual and customary manner.<br/><br/>The original soundtrack was brilliant and so crazy that it wasn't allowed into the Oscars. Sounds like politics to me. But it really put the icing on the film. Glad it won the Grammy, though.<br/><br/>I was reminded of All That Jazz quite a bit during this film. A lot of similarities: Broadway plays, magical/deluded thinking, death wishes, ego and legacy, ex-wife, girlfriend, daughter. But this was a completely different movie, although not a better one in many ways (ATJ is one of my all time favs, but Birdman may become one).<br/><br/>It left me conflicted that a major Hollywood studio backed this, as the satire is about the silliness and load of you know that Hollywood often contains. And many of the actors have been in comic book movies. So that kind of watered this film down for me a bit. I wished that the actors bought into the premise wholly, from the outside, and maybe some do (Keaton?). But to wish all that is to wish that Hollywood was not Hollywood and that the Marvel Universe has not taken over Hollywood so completely. Hollywood is lost, probably forever. In fact, this is one of the only worthy Best Picture films of most of this century, as it's just not profitable to make these kinds of movies and no one cares. I've pretty much decided that unless an actor really, really needs the money, that they are all the narcissists they are rumored to be, but I refused to believe (all that ""nice guy/gal stuff""). Why would you need to do more than one? Are their living expenses really THAT high or is the lure of blockbuster love so tempting and even necessary? It's a crazy world and I don't appreciate Keaton for adding to this trend, back when it wasn't one.<br/><br/>I am dismayed at all the bad reviews, which I think is reflective of what people expect now. Most of those review I read got major plot points or script lines wrong, so I have to wonder if they watched it carefully or not at all. I think the advance press didn't do this movie any favors as most of the bile went to the ""artsy fartsy"" direction. I don't watch TV, thus I had no idea beforehand. But if I had, I would have been even more impressed. But then I love films which try to challenge the norm (and after all, a play is nothing but 3 or 4 long scenes!). However, this is NOT an art film. That these reviewers have no idea what an art film is shows not to take those reviews seriously. And why did this film elicit so much anger? A bad Marvel sequel only gets, ""Well, I was expecting more..."" and 6-7stars, but this gets all the anger of their movie going lives. I guess that about says it all..."
"ddcharbon","5","1","1","26 August 2019"," Seriously, Best Picture?
","Magical realism in film is tricky stuff because it's just so damned easy to do on film. Novelists don't have the luxury of special effects, so when they transcend known reality, there has to be something mythic driving the scene to make it work (as in Morrison's Beloved or Allende's House of Spirits). It can work on film too--Pan's Labyrinth--but in this film, it's never clear what all the suspension of gravity is about. Is Keaton's character schizoid? Does he really have strange powers? Why do those powers never actually figure in the plot? The script violates many times Chekov's rule that a gun in the first act better go off in the third, though, of course, a gun does go off over and over again and if you can't guess what will happen the last time it goes off, then you weren't paying attention to the filmmaker's all too telegraphed intentions. The ending is downright bogus--why does the character do what he does and why does the filmmaker choose a magical realist ending? What has the character learned or gained at this point? And, why, seriously, did he try to off himself? Does any actor really try to kill themselves because their career isn't what it used to be--and especially before they find out whether or not the comeback they risked everything for is going to work? I can't think of a single actual Hollywood suicide that was simply a matter of a struggling career (no drugs, no disease, no alcoholism). To sum it up, I just don't buy what's going on in this movie. Keaton overacts as usual. Norton is awesome as is Emma Stone as a bug-eyed recovering addict whose sexy as hell. Naomi Watts has too little to do--oh yes, there's also a lesbian subplot with her that goes nowhere as well. And the jazz drumming soundtrack is annoying. I like jazz drumming; it just doesn't work here because it is always the same tempo and tone, so instead of punctuating changes and dramatic peaks, it becomes a guarantor of a monotonous frenzy. This movie is pretentious rather than profound; novel rather than original; self-congratulatory rather than truly self-examining. So, of course, Hollywood creamed themselves over it and gave it the Oscar. So it goes."

","Riggan Thomson was a famed actor who gained recognition for playing the lead role in a superhero film series. More than two decades later, he's faded from the limelight and continually tormented by a derisive inner voice and a vivid, overactive imagination. Determined to stay relevant and be recognized as a serious actor, he takes on the task of writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation, taking his girlfriend, lawyer/best friend, estranged, strung out daughter, and a talented but loose cannon method actor along for the ride. An intense, surreal, and immersive movie experience with terrific dialogue, outstanding visuals, clever, self-referential humor, and a story that's riveting from start to finish. Nearly every actor is phenomenal across the board, and Inarritu's crafty directorial style is astonishingly effective, allowing for several tense, character-to-character interactions that will both shock and amuse. An impressive and unique piece of work, with an ending that'll leave much to talk about afterwards. ***½"

","Common knowledge would have you believe that 'Inception', 'Mad Max: Fury Road', 'Django Unchained', 'Toy Story 3' and 'The Wolf of Wall Street' are the five best films of the 2010s so far. Whilst I don't think that any of those choices are bad films ('Fury Road' and 'Toy Story 3' in particular are great), I'm always left wondering as to why this masterpiece is left out of so many people's lists.<br/><br/>I don't like that word 'masterpiece', I think modern audiences associate it too often with good, not great films. I use it lightly, this is one of only four other films released since 2010 that I associate that word with.<br/><br/>I watched this film on DVD recently after it came out... loved it. I thought it was one of the best films I have ever seen, and I still do. I had heard mild rumblings online that a sizeable percentage of audience members were not impressed with it.<br/><br/>I decided to write this review after watching a video online. I won't mention who released it but three competitors were asked ""Which bad film, did the critics love"". The three options the competitors gave were 'Citizen Kane', 'Snowpiercer' and 'Birdman'. Three great films. The thing is, after the 90 minute video, I still couldn't understand why the American didn't like 'Birdman' (or the other two films for that matter). However, I can think of several reasons why 'Birdman' was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>1) It's bloomin' beautiful. You'll probably struggle to find anyone who doesn't believe that the mostly one take camera movement that Alejandro G. Iñárritu decided upon didn't look great. The problem the American had with this technique is that ""why is it made to look like on take!?"". Why not? Not only does it look fantastic, it also keeps the narrative flowing at a great pace and perfectly shows what it's like to work at a West End theatre, it's cramped, everythings two feet away from everything else backstage and Iñárritu used the camera to show this space.<br/><br/>2) The performances are great. No, they are. Everyone loves Michael Keaton, never trust anyone who doesn't like Michael Keaton. I do like Eddie Redmayne and I thought his performance in 'The Theory of Everything' was phenomenal. But I feel like the little gold man belonged to Keaton that year. The Americans main problem in the acting department was Emma Stone... he still didn't give me a good enough reason why. Credit where it's due, Stone was great because she was the only member of the cast who had to properly act. Keaton, Norton, Watts and etc were all great in this film, but I did feel that they were playing exaggerated versions of themselves (that's not a complaint btw). Stone was the only member of the cast who I felt as though was not playing herself, but was adapting to a character who doesn't share to many similar traits. That's good acting.<br/><br/>3) The story is great. Another one of the American's complaints was the story. He said, the story and the characters fell flat. Mate... they just didn't. As my Art teacher once said ""You could look at a red box and say to yourself 'it's blue, it's blue, it's blue' but at the end of the day it's not, it's red"". You can look at the story and say ""The story fell flat, the story fell flat, the story fell flat"", but at the end of the day... it just didn't. It is literally said in the film ""People, they love blood. They love action. Not this talky, depressing, philosophical b******t."" Iñárritu literally talked to the audience. The rough translation is ""People don't want to think when they see a film anymore"". As the reaction of ""passive audience"" members proved, this statement is corrected.<br/><br/>I think the reason why a lot of people write off this film is because they can't be asked to think and get hold of the meaning. I think the reason films like 'Django Unchained' and 'The Wolf of Wall Street' are considered by many two of the best films of the 2010s is because you don't have to think to hard to watch them (I don't like either film, but I like DiCaprio btw). Their good films, but neither are masterpieces.<br/><br/>2014 was, overall, a great year for films. 'Whiplash' = great, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' = great, 'Nightcrawler' = great. We also got 'Boyhood', 'Gone Girl', 'The Babadook', 'The LEGO Movie'. Speaking of ""Talky, depressing, philosophical b******t"", we got some of the best, well made and most heartfelt summer action blockbusters in a long time in the form of 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (the latter of which being the MCU's best film). However, as far as I'm concerned 'Birdman' is the king of the castle, the leader of the pack, the rightful Best Picture winner.<br/><br/>As far as i'm concerned, 'Birdman' is one of the best films of the 2010s so far, maybe even the best. And considering there is only nine months left of the 2010s, I think it's going to stay that way.<br/><br/>(BTW- If you didn't like this film, but do like explodey-wodey, mindless action films... at least have the decency to admit that you're a ""passive"" audience member)."

","If you only have one movie to watch or rewatch let it be this one. I was blown away. I'm late to the bird-part partly because I didn't wanna join the hype that surrounded this movie but boy am I happy I changed my mind.
Thanks to an intelligent script, great directing and elite performances in both main and supporting cast, Birdman takes you on an unforgettable journey that's about mental health, consequences of ambition, father-daughter relationship, romance and its complications, artistic vision, celeb culture vs.passion for acting, jealousy and competitiveness.
The stand out scene imho is where Keaton is acting that he's acting, before he aggressively lashes out on Norton's character (who btw is equally impressive) and the confrontation is spell binding. You forget everything around you, somehow you're just sucked into the universe and are a participant, you can almost smell the flowers in the vase and feel the air when he later floats above the tall buildings and his frantic rants are full of heart wrenching sadness yet amusing in its revelations.
Emma Stone is the other half of the heart and soul of Birdman, her fragility, sarcastic and completely spaced out persona manages to make the viewer feel both empathy and mild repulsion, she owns every scene she's in.
The only reason why I didn't rate this 10 is because it could've been a bit longer. It's such a rare emotion, often there's a natural need for an ending, a resolution but this time I simply was so struck that I wanted it to continue just a bit more. You laugh, cry, ponder, fantasize and stay transfixed the entire time.
Do yourself a massive favour and indulge in this magnificent, colorful, at times crazy and annoying bird, yet the more you watch you discover the beauty and the message that's behind its multi layered feathers."

It seems to be trying to grasp something that is profound but only partly hits the mark. Also, a few cheap and old tricks lower the overall effect.

","Simply spectacular, the cinematography of Birdman is just surprising, it is recorded in such a fashion that it looks like a single shot, and you can appreciate the great work of direction on the part of Alejandro González Iñarritu, and the great performance of micheal Keaton, just wow.The main character, Riggan Thomson, is very well developed, and the plot of the film can become somewhat philosophical and even depressive at some point but always seeks to transmit something to the viewer.The only thing that I could criticize about this film is that in the second half it focuses mainly on riggan thomson (micheal Keaton) and the other characters that seemed very important at the beginning and also have a good plot background practically do not appear in thispart, like his daughter Sam who is a former drug addict who lives with a dad who left her (played by emma stone) or Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) as the douchebag of the movie, as an experienced Broadway actor who gets a lot intohis character and sometimes it does not seem to be able to distinguish the thin line between reality and fiction.In conclusion it is an excellent appreciative, artistic film, it is not a typical Hollywood movie with big budget and explosions, if you like art and cinema, you will like this movie because for me it is one of the best of the last decade andthis century."
"imseeg","10","1","1","7 January 2019"," Starts out as a formidably crafted director's gem, evolves into an excellent lighthearted drama and finally spirals into a fantastically magical experience. Bravo!
","Director Inarritu has got an unique talent to play with moving images as if he were a child. His style is so incredibley refreshing and funny, real, magical and just darn mesmirizing. We get to see true to life drama mixed in with short magical dreamlike moments. And all this madness gets interwoven with hilarious tongue in cheek jokes. Sounds crazy and incomprehensible, right? But it is still one heck of basic true to life story about love. And about great fears of not being loved...<br/><br/>What's this miraculous story all about then? In essence the story is quite simple, although in it's display (photography), it looks more like fireworks going off! The basic story though is about Michael Keaton playing a has been Hollywood actor, who desperatedly wants to prove to the critics that he can really act by performing in a prestigeous play on Broadway. Will he succeed and become a critics favorite overnight or will he fail miserably at this new prestigeous theatre role and become the biggest laughingstock on Broadway?<br/><br/>This is firstmost a movie about ACTING. And terrific acting performances is what you will get! Mesmirizing photography and a thumping spectucalur soundtrack is what you wil get as well. Tons of it. I mean it just wont get any better than this, you really gotta see it to believe it HOW director Innaritu has played with camera and sound to create this very playful piece of art.<br/><br/>I just wanna applaud this movie for it's playfulness. I love it's charm, because it's full of lust for life! It's bigger than life itself, yet simultaneously so humbling and human as well. I am just a bit lost for words out of sheer exuberance! I have seen it 5 times already and it still stays as riveting and mesmirizing as the very first time...<br/><br/>Bravo!"

The cinematography is compelling and pulls the viewer relentlessly from scene to scene -- it's impressive to watch. The performances are also very strong.

I think that Edward Norton really would have given so much more to the movie if he had a bigger role or more time on the screen.<br/><br/>The storyline was somewhat confusing to me, although still entertaining enough for the most parts.<br/><br/>I did, however, find the movie was way too long though, and it seemed like it could have served it better if they had trimmed it down from two hours to something like an hour and thirty minutes.

","I did not see this back when it was in theaters.... I finally watched 'Birdman' for the 1st time just last week. And good I waited.
Think I appreciate the story and the main character, played expertly by Michael Keaton, now, as I can relate to the struggles he was going through. I'm not an actor, and have no allusions to 'Fame', even the 15-minute variety that artist Andy Warhol once spoke of... But, being a near senior citizen, the trials and tribulations of anyone that is over 'a certain age' is something that I, and anyone in that era of life, that also likes a thoughtful AND entertaining story/film, surely can relate to....
We might all not have an 'inner voice' that insults us, and eggs us on to 'Do Better' (while said voice appears, now and then, visibly - and, wearing a super hero suit), but we are fallible, sometimes (often) ego-driven creatures.... and simply just want to know we are loved (lovable?) and appreciated - as we go faster and faster through this often hectic, and at times crazy & stressful existence, on this tiny speck floating in an immense and indifferent universe!
This film is both fascinating and a bit perplexing, so I will have to watch it a second and third time... very soon. But, if you like watching odd & unusual types of films: one that has humor, occasional fantasy & action, and social commentary - and especially, if you enjoy the underrated and excellent acting of Mr. Michael Keaton - then 'Birdman' just might be the film for you? Enjoy!"
"filmhistorydigests","7","1","1","2 April 2018"," Lost and Found: The Potential of Birdman
","With the movie ""Birdman"", I tend to be asking myself while watching it, ""What's the point?"". Several ties throughout the movie I felt were lacking due to the style of the whole ""One take shot"" feel the movie was going for that drastically changed how the pacing of the movie felt. The substance of the film and what it gave me felt a little bloated to me personally while compared to more traditionally made movies that I found myself enjoying more. I can tell why this movie could be entertaining to certain people but it's just not for me. About everything I said as a fault are really the only reason I didn't enjoy the film though. The filmmaking and cinematography was great for what it could of been even if it wasn't used to it's greatest potential and I found myself very interested in almost every character in the film with Edward Norton's character being a great highlight. I would recommend this film to anyone just to show them how well shot and masterfully directed this is, and maybe they would enjoy the bits I didn't as well more than me. The thing about Birdman is its more of what you take out of it than what it gives you, which is something to marvel at, despite the fact that I basically found the movie to drag a lot. But the set pieces and excellent acting in the movie more than makes up for it."
"monstercolorfun","6","1","1","4 December 2016"," Original concept, well made, too frenetic and lacking composure
","It's commendable that Hollywood should use theatrical timing to make films, because recent titles are often feel like pop videos. <br/><br/>Woody Allen is a master at that, refusing his actors screen time shorter than 2 minutes in order to express a complex feeling. Modern films do that in a couple of seconds, and become emotionally junk. <br/><br/>I don't like woody Allen but i think that his direction of the camera, the scene and the tempo of the acting is superior that what this awesome cast achieved. <br/><br/>It's a film which was written for the ex batman star, and attracted a lot of good actors due to it's theatrical basis, but it failed to capture my interest. <br/><br/>The frenetic pace was contrived, speaking was too fast, the scenes weren't elaborate, perhaps to put the viewer in the shoes of a person in situ, the camera explores the scene like someone walking around. <br/><br/>The greatest test of composure is calm moments of intensity, and a charged silence which raises many question in between words... The lack of silence was the problem for the film. no scenic metaphors interrupted the constant hurried speaking, there was no space for reverie, although it could be a very enjoyable film after a drink and a rowdy night out, in the Cinema. <br/><br/>I'd rate Bullets Over Broadway (1994) as being superior, perhaps just to the beauty of it's setting, it calm composure, compared to the chaos and drab backgrounds of this film and it's endless frenzy. The lack of contrast in color also with the backgrounds helped to make the frantic pace tedious, where a larger and less mundane backdrop may have lifted the unnatural uniterrupted fast chatter of the film in order to make the it more watchable."

Michael Keaton does come through with a wonderful performance, as well as Edward Norton. The overuse of ""f*ck,"" however, dumbs-down the greatness. The comedy is quite amusing and the one-shot look (however there are cuts in the end) definitely is astounding the genius needed in the cameraman, editor, director, and most of all, the actors. Everything needed in a satirical film, such as Birdman, is definitely present, however it just doesn't all perfectly add- up as you may have hoped. This is still a good movie, just not great.

This movie was a total letdown to be honest, the screenplay was mediocre at best, acting was great, and the cinematography was at its best. In the end, I was not satisfied by the film, it bore me most of the film, a disappointing film in short. Therefore this film should not deserve such respect from the media and critics.

","This is the first time I'm using these words, Birdman is a ""modern classic"". I've seen a lot of films from IMDb's top 250 recently and Birdman has just become my favorite of all time alongside The Dark Knight and The Shawshank Redemption. Although Birdman has no similarity with either one of them. In fact you can't connect Birdman with any other film despite all the cultural references. Birdman is one of a kind.<br/><br/>Marvelous film making. Powerful screenplay. Legendary acting performance. Alejandro González Iñárritu, before Birdman I've never heard of this man. So it's not like I have some kind of weakness for his style or anything. Yet I've found his directing phenomenal in Birdman. Michael Keaton, experienced actor provided with a role he can connect to easily and the result was acting of a lifetime. Surely Birdman will win Oscar in these three major categories. I feel sorry for Edward Norton and Emma Stone, they gave their best in this film but their roles weren't significant enough to get them on a solid platform to fight for their Oscars. The story is another masterpiece. It's a battle between family and ego. Oh! You think that's Cliché! Don't worry it also have explosions, superheroes and other box office shits. The kind of craps kids these days want. The stuffs that goes viral.<br/><br/>The musical score and the production design are kind of annoying but I think they are meant to be annoying. The film editing is another beauty. I don't understand why it didn't get another Academy Award nomination for film editing.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Birdman will show you the plain truth you've always failed to see.

"rickhouska","4","7","18","5 January 2015"," Bared man screeches for birdseed, gets pecked instead.
","Fine actors, intense performances, set in a classic Broadway theater, together with very clever camera work and a fractured storyline, all come together to produce a ""masterpiece"" of cinematic cacophony. Meaning an extremely harsh, discordant mixture of sights and sounds. From the opening credits, a drummer (think of an eleven year old in the garage with a new drum set) bangs away, insuring a certain amount of distraction no matter what you think of the movie...<br/><br/>So, we meet Riggan (MIchael Keaton), a very successful Hollywood super hero (Birdman) who has come to NYC to direct and act in his own Broadway play. He has great hopes, but pulling this off will not be easy. His wide-eyed, bratty daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), just out of rehab, lurks in the wings and does her best to remind him of his shortcomings, as well as flirt with Mike (Edward Norton), the play's obnoxious male lead. Riggan's girlfriend, Laura (Andrea Riseborough), does not feel loved, and wants more attention. And, here are others sapping Riggan of what energy he has left, and we wonder how will he survive, let alone open a successful play. <br/><br/>But Riggan has something of an ace up his sleeve; he possesses special powers. Think moving things at a distance as in telekinesis. We see this power whenever he is angry and he uses it to destroy things in his office. Think also of defying gravity. In the beginning we see Riggan sitting in air, perhaps meditating on the challenge before him. What else might Riggan be able to do? The answer more or less allows the story to reach a conclusion, sort of.<br/><br/>Never mind the fractured story line, and din of the drums, the main problem with this movie is the difficulty in liking anyone. For me, the one scene worth seeing again is the bar confrontation between the NYT critic, Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan) and Riggan. Don't get up and leave until you see it. You just might get behind Riggan after he rebuts her major put down of him and his play.<br/><br/>But don't bet on it! Masterpiece? I think not. More, missed a piece!"
"jtindahouse","8","6","15","30 January 2015"," A unique film told with a lot of class
","Every now and then you come across a film that is unlike anything you've seen before. Sometimes it's hard to put your finger on what exactly makes it so unique but you are in no doubt that is. 'Birdman' is definitely one of those films. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu used a very distinct style while filming this (which sounds like it was a nightmare for the actors), but it has produced great results. It comes across as quirky and fun and gives a sense that the unexpected is right around the corner. I was surprised to see that he is a relatively inexperienced director, as this could easily have been mistaken for the work of a genius of the industry who had been applying his trade for many a decade.<br/><br/>The acting is also nothing short of superb. Michael Keaton is obviously the stand out in the lead role. He's in a two horse race with Eddie Redmayne to win Best Actor at the Academy Awards this year and I wouldn't be shocked if he pulled it off. He is captivating in the role and never has even so much as a single weak scene throughout the film. The style the movie was filmed in will give his chances of winning a real boost as well, as you can tell it would have been anything but easy work to make.<br/><br/>The other two actors who have been nominated for their supporting roles are Edward Norton and Emma Stone. Norton (who I often refer to as my favourite actor) is nothing short of his brilliant best. You know a performance is great when you are genuinely missing that character being on screen and that's how it was in this. He goes almost entirely missing near the end of the film and it is a real shame because I never felt like I got any closure on his character. Stone is also good, although I think gets overshadowed by the two main actors. I have found the Best Supporting Actress category to be a little weak this year and I think this has helped a few performances get recognition that may not have in other years. There's no doubting though that she held her own in every scene she was in and gave a very solid performance.<br/><br/>'Birdman' certainly won't be for everyone. The person I was watching it with couldn't stand it and left about half an hour in for instance. It's billed as a comedy but it's far from conventional in that sense and could disappoint a few people in that way. It's absolutely filled with inside jokes (some right in your face, others not so much) that are imperative to keep in mind throughout if you are to fully appreciate it. The script has certainly been well thought out and the dialogue is excellently written. <br/><br/>It's the only film in the Best Picture category giving 'Boyhood' a run for its money, and while it is a slight outsider (it has roughly the same chance of winning as Keaton does of upsetting Redmayne) I would not be the least bit surprised to hear its name read out as the winner come February 22. I've always said the Academy loves a film and about a film (or in this instance a play - as close as they're going to get this year). It will be very interesting to see it all pan out. Top filmmaking."

It was also nice to see Ed Norton acting again, a very strong character role which worked well for him. The film for me could have captured more of 'the Birdman' explaining and showing more of the past Birdman. I liked the concept of the movie but it could have had more excitement, however given its drama / theater premise it was to be expected. I was however impressed with the films constant camera pursuit which carried the imagery of the film well, it kept the film alive by using this camera technique. What i didn't like too much was the constant jazz club drumming throughout the film, sometimes it seemed to distract from some scenes, also it was amusing to hear a comeback from 'Beetle juice' there is a scene when Michael Keaton wakes up drunk on a staircase and the Birdman is talking to him.

It's very original and out there, the whole film is shot as it it were one long take with no cuts whatsoever (a great feat on part of both the actors and director Alejandro González Iñárritu). The acting in Birdman is absolutely spot on; for me every single actor in this film gave me their best performance I've seen. This can particularly be said for Edward Norton (who I believe should win Oscar for Best Supporting Actor from this), Michael Keaton (showing new depths as an actor I've not seen from him, and a performance which will certainly be unforgettable for most that have seen him) and Emma Stone (who is as wonderful as she usually is). The story is crafted excellently, with the plot always being different and interesting, and making you care about what's going on with all the characters. The only small problem I have with this film is the ambiguous ending, but I don't have too much of a problem with that. I have no reservations whatsoever about giving this film 5 stars, it is now my second favourite film of all time. The score (unfortunately deemed 'not eligible' for the best score Oscar) is brilliant, for the most part being some excellent drum work, always fitting perfectly and building tension.

","""For what else is the life of man but a kind of play in which men in various costumes perform until the director motions them offstage?"" – Erasmus <br/><br/>Once you add up the upcoming films from Marvel and DC studios, there are twenty two ""superhero"" films being planned over the course of the next four years. Though decried for their paucity of artistic merit, what is often overlooked is that these films, with their depiction of a magic pretty much gone from some of our lives, are not only popular because of their enhanced action scenes but fill a void in the current paradigm saturated by materialistic culture that does not recognize our personal power. Of course, for those who feel their acting talents might be better utilized, these films are not their friend.<br/><br/>Case in point, Riggan Thompson (Michael Keaton) whose career in Hollywood took off with his role in the superhero film Birdman, the title of the new movie by Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu (Biutiful). Though he has played other roles since then, the only one that prompts requests for his autograph is Birdman. Frustrated with how his career has become sidetracked, Riggan has turned to Broadway for redemption. Now middle-aged, Riggan attempts to resurrect his career as an actor by writing, directing, and starring in an adaptation for the stage of Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.<br/><br/>Shot by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki inside and around the landmark St. James Theater in New York City close to Times Square, the film follows Riggan's frenetic attempts to put the show together despite overweening self doubts and a roller coaster relationship with the cast and crew, especially his co-star Lesley (Naomi Watts) and girl friend Laura (Andrea Riseborough). Also in the picture is Riggan's daughter Sam (Emma Stone), a production assistant who has recently been released from rehab.<br/><br/>Still resentful of her dad's absence during her formative years, Sam is very critical of his refusal to use social media as a means of promotion. ""You don't even have a Facebook page,"" she says. It's like you don't even exist."" Inarritu creates a frenetic pace with long shots following different actors, while weaving in episodes of magic realism that include scenes of flying and the costumed Birdman, aka his conscience, following him with advice about making another superhero movie. ""Those people don't know what you are capable of,"" he says.<br/><br/>When one of the primary actors is hurt during rehearsals, he is replaced by the volatile Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) who gets into disputes with Riggan about how each scene should be performed while blatantly pursuing Riggan's daughter, though he tells her he can only perform on stage but is impotent off the set. The three preview performances do not go well and a meeting in the bar with the highly critical New York Times theater critic (Lindsay Duncan) who rails against actors and threatens to ""kill the play"" leaves him in a state of despair, underscored by his encounter with a street actor shouting the Shakespearean lines from Macbeth about how ""tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day."" <br/><br/>Aside from his lawyer and best friend Jake (Zach Galifianakis), Riggan's main anchor seems to be his ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan) who provides him with the ego boost he so desperately needs. In its attempt to create a satire reaching for wit and originality, Birdman touches on but mostly skirts around several different themes: the inability of an aging actor to adjust to a changing environment, the nature of our true identity beyond the roles we play in life, the art versus entertainment conundrum, and the inordinate worship of celebrities in contemporary culture.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite an Oscar-worthy performance by Michael Keaton in a welcome return to the screen and the film's engaging moments of true energy, the film does not pause long enough between the drumbeat of a jazzy score by Antonio Sanchez, the lugubrious strings of Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony, its pseudo-profound spirituality and juvenile humor to say anything meaningful about any of these subjects."

"petersaarloos","9","5","12","24 February 2015"," A spoiler-free introduction to Birdman
","READ THIS FIRST: I give an abstract description of what happens in the film without describing any actual content. Therefore, this review is quite (though not entirely) spoiler free, but if you simply want an answer to the question: 'Should I watch Birdman?' I recommend skipping to the end!<br/><br/>Birdman is a film about the kind of life Michael Keaton might have, starring Micheal Keaton.<br/><br/>This premise is excellent and was to me reason enough to go see Birdman. Furhermore, the acting is excellent by every single cast member and the direction is original and compelling, effectively entwined with the motives of the film. The theater feels claustrophobic and the odd transitions maintain a feel of unpredictability. There is also a continuity in the filming that is very well executed. From a professional perspective, Birdman delivers.<br/><br/>But there's also a lot of things that Birdman is not, that you may expect it to be from trailers: Birdman is not a superhero movie in any obvious or direct sense. It is for the most part about the work and life in theater. The charge that this is pretentious is understandable: someone who comes into Birdman expecting an eccentric work of art won't be disappointed, but someone who expects to be easily entertained will find it bothersome. <br/><br/>The first three-quarters of the film are tense and exciting for anyone who feels the impending doom of a show about to fall apart (a tension comparable to that of Misses Doubtfire), but this tension borders on anxiety inducing. None of the characters feel strongly relatable, each rendered unpredictable by their own Freudian struggles; as a result, the cynical voice of Birdman in the head of main protagonist Riggan Thomson (Keaton) becomes oddly comforting. Mike Shines (Norton) personifies this unpredictability: he is a despicable human being who cares only about what happens on stage, making him an ideal artist and a scumbag simultaneously.<br/><br/>While Mike Shines personifies Riggan's professional effort to create legitimate art, he is also confronted with his personal life, particularly his detachment with it. All the characters display their personal flaws in a believably (though perhaps a little rushed), but those of Riggan are most credible. He is tormented by his loss of celebrity relevance, and although he loves his daughter and ex-wife, he has convinced himself he needs his fame to earn their respect.<br/><br/>This forms the triad of values in his life: family, art, and fame. Riggan has trouble separating these three. He tries to become relevant again by doing theater, something he considers real art contrary to his Birdman career. In doing so, he hopes to win the respect of his ex-wife and daughter. Yet his work is overshadowed by Birdman who explicitly torments him with the questions: Aren't you doing all this for celebrity and fame? Then why not just make Birdman 4?<br/><br/>The pretentiousness of the entire first part of the film comes mostly from the jokes about actors and how shallow their dreams may be or seem. This, combined with the anxiously unpredictable atmosphere that surrounds the theater, makes the first part of the film a little difficult to watch. Yet the movie all builds up to a wonderful climax that literally transcends the entirety of the first part of the film and requires the petty personal quarrels of all these characters, only to be forgotten right after.<br/><br/>It is Riggan's eventual identification with Birdman that creates the continuity in his life, work and fame, not elegantly or clearly, but flawed with paradox. This forms a beautiful conclusion: Riggan may be old, flawed, even confused, but he was and is Birdman. And Birdman can fly.<br/><br/>RECOMMENDATION: In summary, Birdman deals with the struggles of artists who must navigate their lives around their work, popularity and personal lives. This struggle is presented in a way that is easy to understand, though perhaps not always pleasant to watch. The contemporary theme of heroism is very fitting, though only a minor part of the film. I highly recommend Birdman to anyone who feels they can relate to the artist's struggle."

What also makes these performances even better is the way this film was shot. It looked like it was one continuous shot from beginning to end so the actors had to be on point the entire time. One mistake and they have to go back 10 minutes to fix it.<br/><br/>The story is about a former actor who writes, stars and directs his own play. He wants to feel relevant again after doing three ""Birdman"" films. This is a homage to Michael Keaton playing Batman long ago. There are things that happen in this film that might confuse you but just go with it and it'll all makes sense in the end.<br/><br/>Once again, the acting is brilliant and the story is interesting along with quite a few hilarious scenes.

And whatever the astonishing contributions of actors Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and the host of others (including Emma Stone), and whatever the equally astonishing contributions of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (""Tree of Life,"" ""Gravity,"" and ""Children of Men"" for starters) and composer Antonio Sanchez, it is Iñárritu who makes this all gel, makes it vivid, and makes it make sense. Watch all these people over the next couple decades, but most of all watch him.<br/><br/>You might say that this movie suffers from over-production, from being too amazing, from avoiding truly human qualities and human issues by rising above and being a sensation. Fine. Skip it. Watch ""Amour"" over and over. I love those movies, too, but that doesn't leave this out. It's a great example of combining the formal elements of movie-making with interesting plot and great acting. It's true that it makes a gloss of anything tender and intimate, even if at times it seems to try for depth, but overall it does what it really intends to very well.<br/><br/>For those who do like astonishing camera-work, don't miss this. The film is shot as if done in one single long take, camera moving with cunning fluidity through rooms, hallways, streets, and theater spaces without stop. Ever. There are clearly times where a break is snuck in, or one is implied (the camera is continuous but the time of day is not, and we see an actor in front of us that was just somewhere else). But if a long take is immersive (that's its point, to create the sense of now and extend it and extend it so that you feel involved), this long take of a movie is so immersive it's spellbinding. For two hours.<br/><br/>Add the free form drumming, which at first is almost irritating in its offbeat asynchrony, and add some stunning lighting from scene to scene, and you have an elegantly jarring movie. But then you realize, with this intense acting (all extremely well done), that the script is also superb. What they are saying and arguing about and proposing to each other in interwoven ways as this ensemble cast digs in is really interesting. It's not quite glib or flashy or superficial even if the movie has pushed it all to an extreme.<br/><br/>Yeah, see this. A pleasure and an impressive feat."

","Birdman director Inarittu excels himself here. Not just is Birdman technically brilliant with its almost fluent long takes,but ground- breaking through its moral questioning. <br/><br/>Firstly, Birdman is entertaining to its core. As well as a strong script, performances particularly from Keaton, Norton and Stone are extremely strong and laugh-out-loud hilarious. The film-making itself is also a technical achievement. Inarittu's ability bulk out character development whilst also creating a fluent, enthralling story about Keaton's last shot at an acting career after years playing his alter ego, Birdman, is second to none.<br/><br/>However where this film particularly excels in its metaphorical meaning. So many brutally honest questions are asked by this film about not just movie industry itself, but about us as a human race. Is creativity dead within motion picture? Are those who act on screen hierarchical to all else? Do you have to have supernatural power to be superhuman?<br/><br/>All these questions are asked of the viewer and many more. It's snub at the Globes is a travesty, and I implore all who love film not just to be passive but insightful to catch Birdman before it leaves theaters."

","Personally, I can identify with Riggan Thomas. It hit me like a ton of bricks when daughter Sam (Emma Stone) laid him out for the has-been he appears to be - no bloggers, no Twitter and no Facebook - that's me to the bone! But there's a difference, I know I'm not irrelevant. <br/><br/>So I understand Michael Keaton's been busy as an actor, but to me it seems like he disappeared after the Eighties. My impression of him as a comic actor dates back to ""Night Shift"", ""Gung Ho"" and ""Beetlejuice"", and if I didn't have to be reminded, I would have almost forgotten that he had the Batman franchise at one time. I never thought he was right for that role, but then again, not many have been.<br/><br/>So the interesting thing here is that Riggan Thomas (Keaton) is attempting to revive his career after a two decade hiatus from the role of iconic super-hero Birdman, by producing and directing a serious stage play - ""He's a Hollywood clown in a lycra bird suit"" is the way theater critic Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) sees him. Riggan suffers all the roller coaster emotions one might expect from a down on his luck former star who can't quite shake the insecurity that comes with trying something new and different. It doesn't help that his immediate circle is just as dysfunctional as he is.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about the movie's sub-title - 'The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance'. It's apropos I think, because Riggan's passion was his mission to see the production through to opening night despite the disastrous previews and circumstances popping up to keep him distracted from his goal. Had he not maintained an ignorance or perhaps more correctly, a distance from those distractions, he might have given up entirely. There's no greater commitment than walking through New York City as a celebrity in your underwear to get to your appointed mark on time.<br/><br/>Hitchcock would have been proud of this film I think, there were at least two maguffins employed by the writers that wound up having no bearing on the story. First there was Ralph, the actor who got taken out by the stage light, but the bigger one was the unresolved plot thread of Riggan's 'powers' like his telekinesis. However the latter could have been a manifestation of Riggan's inner battle with his alter-ego Birdman, and the instances of his moving objects with his mind might have been only things he was seeing.<br/><br/>You know, when Riggan removed his bandages in the hospital I don't know what I was expecting, but the nose at first had me thinking of Karl Malden. It kept nagging me because I knew that wasn't quite right. Then, just like my first thought when I started this review it hit me. Riggan Thomas transformed himself into Mickey Rourke's Marv from ""Sin City""."

","I'm going to keep this short. After reading many various reviews I gave this interesting looking film a shot. A regrettable decision.<br/><br/>After waiting for this film to build to something I was left sorely disappointed. The whole picture revolves around dull dialogue and no funny scenarios.<br/><br/>The adverts for this film had left me expecting a superhero in an amusing bird costume, but instead I was stuck with the mad ramblings of a boring character played by Michael Keaton with cameo Zach Galifianakis well out of his range in a serious role.<br/><br/>Finally the two hour long feature came to an end, but if you, like me, were expecting the loose ends in this story to be tied up, you'd be wrong again.

","When it comes to films, I try and stay hidden from advance reviews in order to always go into the cinema with an open mind and thus, be unaware of what anyone has said about the film before I have seen it. Unfortunately for the case of Birdman, this was unavoidable. After seeing a range of films in the cinema over Christmas, a Birdman trailer was always guaranteed along with the many 5 star reviews that are presented to you during its' run-time. Because of this, I went into the screening of Birdman with my expectation level moderately high yet, once the film had finished, it is fair to say I wasn't disappointed. <br/><br/>In terms of plot, Micheal Keaton plays Riggan Thompson, a washed-up Hollywood star famous for playing the role of superhero 'Birdman' who, at an attempt to get his career back on track, takes a shot at Broadway by means of writing, directing, and starring in an adaptation of the short story What We Talk About When We Talk About Love by Raymond Carver, an idol of Thompson's. Unbeknownst to anyone else, Thompson is plagued by the subconscious voice of Birdman, who, along with a faltering family and disruptive cast, place Thompson's life and career firmly in the balance. <br/><br/>Firstly, it is fair to say that Birdman is something unlike anything else I think I have ever seen before within cinematic history, with its' mix of genres, (Is it a drama? Black comedy? Satire? Superhero movie?) fantastic cinematography, (by Oscar-winning Emmanuel Lubezki who won the award for Gravity) and a brilliantly barmy plot performed perfectly by an equally superb ensemble cast. Secondly, Keaton is excellent (I am running out of superlatives) as Thompson and should easily be recognised within the upcoming awards season, even if I couldn't help but draw parallels between his character's life and his own (Keaton played Batman in the Tim Burton films). Lastly, the satirical notions regarding cinema in today's society were greatly emphhasised and executed throughout the film, particularly the scene with a fancy dress Iron Man fighting Spider- Man which, in my opinion, was rather splendid. The films' two hour running time, in general, went quickly, although I felt there seemed to be too many scenes where the film was set to end and then quickly carried on, yet this didn't deter the utter joy I felt whilst watching it. <br/><br/>Overall, Birdman is a brilliant, barmy, and bonkers piece of cinema which no doubt will end up somewhere in my Top Ten films of 2015. Keaton is superb. The visuals are stunning. The plot is splendid. RIP Batman, long live Birdman. <br/><br/>Overall Score: 9/10"
"Dfilono","10","5","12","2 January 2015"," Shockingly Amazing
","To be blatantly honest, I din't expect much from this film. I heard it was critically acclaimed, but ""12 Years a Slave"" was also loved by critics and that movie didn't deserve its praise. I was shocked to discover one of the most brilliant movies to be made in the past decade. This movie truly transcends from entertainment to art, and I think that's what the director was going for. First of all, the cinematography was fantastical, allowing the entire film to look like it was made in one shot. It is awe inspiring, but cinematography cannot carry a film. That's where the acting came in. Every character was perfect, played brilliantly by the cast. Characters were not only believable, but also interesting, which is hard to pull off well. The story does fall a little flat, but not so in a bad way. The somewhat simple story allows the actors to play off each other perfectly, and also allows the film to make many statements about things such as film making and critics. The film truly surpassed all expectations, and even explores the psychological side of Micheal Keaton's character, which leads to many shenanigans. These shenanigans show the film to actually be quite funny, and even more entertaining. Birdman was a surprise hit, and it deserves every award it will surely be nominated for. If you missed Birdman, it is a much watch."

","-So Birdman is about an actor named Riggan, played by Michael Keaton, who used to play a Holylwood superhero named Birdman until he quit in 1992. He is now trying to put on an artistic stage-play on Broadway to make himself known as a high class actor really. Only problem is everything. He has Mike, his supporting actor played by Edward Norton, who causes all kind of problems on set. He has his daughter who is just out of rehab. He has a critic who wants to close his play. Oh, and he literally has the character of Birdman following him around like an evil shoulder-angel.<br/><br/>-Birdman is a perfect example of how to make an artistic AND great film! It is pretty impressive in every category I can think of! (Really.) -The story: There are some obvious parallels to Batman in this. In 1992, Michael Keaton says no to Batman 3 after Batman Returns came out. The film is very accepting of this to the point where it is almost mocking Hollywood films, but then defending them! I think the story is great because it is so ground in reality! -The pace of the film is pretty good. One of the BEST things about it is that the entire film looks like one shot. I kid you not. There are a few day-to-night transitions, but other than that there are just no cuts in it.<br/><br/>-The acting is some of the best of the year. Michael Keaton killed it, probably because he could pull from personal experience so much. Edward Norton was probably my favorite actor in it and he killed it! Emma Stone had probably the best performance of her career! And Zach Galifianakis was so good he was actually my favorite character! Never thought I would say that.<br/><br/>-The characters themselves feel real because of how broken they seem. Michael Keaton especially is pretty crazy, whereas it's hard to really love any of the characters.<br/><br/>-The editing is Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>-The music is all drums and symbols, with some classical pieces. Very odd, but very original.<br/><br/>-The themes of the film are probably one of the best things about it. It really dissects what a Hollywood film is by comparing blockbuster pics to indie films and Hollywood to the stage. I could go on and on about it, but it really just lays out what's what.<br/><br/>-Content: It is rated-R. It has some language throughout. Not as much as Fury, but it is consistent. The rest of the content would probably be PG-13. It has a butt and some suggestive content, with some references, implied awkward moments, and an inappropriate kiss. Still probably PG-13 worthy. It also has some brief violence. Also PG-13 worthy. (So R for language) -All-in-all, Birdman was probably, in my seasoned opinion, the best film of the year. It has a great story, great themes, great acting, fantastic editing, and yeah. Birdman is totally worth seeing in theaters! Now I will say it is not like Guardians Of The Galaxy fun, but I will easily give Birdman an 8/10!"

","I saw a trailer for this film, and it was discussed on some film review shows, it was already getting attention and talk of award nominations, so I was definitely going to see it, directed by Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Alejandro González Iñárritu (Amores Perros, Babel, Biutiful). Basically Riggan Thomson (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Michael Keaton) is a washed-up Hollywood actor most famous for playing the superhero Birdman in 90s blockbuster films, he is tormented and criticised by the voice of his former alter ego character, and he sometimes imagines himself performing levitation and telekinesis. Riggan is hoping to reinvent himself as a Broadway actor, writer and director, he is adapting Raymond Carver's short story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"", it is being produced by Riggan's best friend and lawyer Brandon Vander Hay (or Jake) (Zach Galifianakis), and it stars Riggan's girlfriend Laura (Oblivion's Andrea Riseborough) and first-time Broadway actress Lesley (Naomi Watts), and his assistant is his recovering addict daughter Sam (The Help's Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Emma Stone). The show is currently in rehearsals, with previews coming up and the opening night in a few days, during this time Riggan makes a light fall on an actor he doesn't like to replace him, he casts brilliant but volatile method actor Mike Shiner (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Edward Norton), this is proved when during a preview he breaks out of character complaining, and during another preview Riggan performs the final scene where his character laments ""not existing"" and shooting himself, after Mike tells him he should a more realistic prop gun. Things keep going wrong for Riggan as the show opening approaches, he reads early reviews that Mike is stealing the show, he catches Sam smoking pot and during the argument about it she says that he does not matter, he finds out backstage during a preview that she and Mike are lovers, he accidentally locks himself out of the theatre and has to walk through a busy Times Square in just his underwear to get back inside. After all this he runs into influential critic Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan), she tells him she hates ""Hollywood celebrities who pretend to be actors"" and says she will ""kill"" his show with a negative review, he boozes until he collapses and sleeps on the street, and hungover the next day he hallucinates a conversation with Birdman, and flying through New York City. It is opening night, and in the final scene Riggan brings a real gun, using it he shoots his nose off on stage, he earns a standing ovation from the audience, besides Tabitha who leaves during the applause, in hospital Riggan is told by the producer that she have the play a rave review, Sam visits him, and out of the room Riggan climbs onto the window ledge, it is not known whether he jumped, but returning Sam finds he is gone, looks down the street, then the sky, and smiles. Also starring Amy Ryan as Sylvia, Merritt Wever as Annie, Damian Young as Gabriel and Jeremy Shamos as Ralph. Keaton, who was most likely chosen for his real career following Batman being somewhat similar in circumstances, is perfectly as the man on the edge, and Norton is fantastic as the nemesis and method actor from hell, the filming technique where scenes are merged to mostly look like one take is clever, the mid-life crisis of a Hollywood star and a Broadway show having problems before it's even started, both concepts work very well together, the small moments of special effects work with the story, and it is written and directed terrifically, a most worthwhile black comedy drama. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Writing, Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Editing, Best Original Music for Antonio Sanchez, Best Sound and Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical and Best Original Score.

","A satire it may be, but tries much too hard. Two hours of shouting and swearing, coupled with lengthy Steadicam shots round the backstage corridors detracted from its purpose. The conceit of showing the soundtrack drummer as busking in the street is OK once. Then do it again in side space backstage - very poor. The flying sequence went on way too long, at that point in the film I was expecting it to blend into the end credits. No such luck, still a way to go. I also felt, despite Michael Keaton's strong acting (the only good thing about it)even he fell into the trap of overacting at times. Edit it down to 80 - 90 minutes it might be worth 3 stars. As it is, save your money and 2 hours of your life.

"sleons","1","4","9","17 March 2015"," Iñárritu's worst film by far
","This film sucks in every way possible. The only thing that it has it's the fact it was made in a ""continuous sequence shot"". It lacks a central theme. By the end I was never sure if it talked about the creative process of artist or how society won't let you reinvent yourself as a creator, amongst thousands of other unfulfilled themes the script was never able to portray. One thing I am sure of, is this film is Iñárritu talking about himself in the most self centered way possible. I love all of his other films, and even though they are dramas with a longer running time than this one, Birdman is by far the toughest film he has.<br/><br/>I know it is impossible to criticize a film that all critics consider a master piece. This is just a modern example of the emperors new clothes.<br/><br/>Technique is there to tell a compelling story, without that it's pretty much useless. Hitchcock did a film with the same style, The Rope, for me, this is one of his worst films.<br/><br/>Birdman is considered a comedy, but Alejandro González Iñárritu isn't a funny man. I didn't laugh once throughout the film. I am a big fan of his work but have always hated listening to him. He wants to demonstrate how intellectually superior he is every time he speaks about his movies using the most complex language possible. Alejandro we get it, you are talented. Now stop being such a douche. Take a page from Woody Allen's book (not the having sex with your adopted Asian daughter part, but the part were you try to be more humble).<br/><br/>Also this might not be a popular opinion, but, Michael Keaton is a terrible actor. This is a role he was ""born"" to play, and he is as stale as watching a sock puppet perform. This was similar to Mickey Rourke on the Wrestler, the difference is Rourke was always fantastic and that role really fitted him, Keaton always sucked.<br/><br/>The Oscars have never really meant much since we've never known why they are given (sometimes they really deserved it, sometimes they owed it to them and sometimes it's just mere politics). I really think Foxcatcher was a superior film in every way possible and was robed by this over-hyped garbage."

His emotion real, his pain confusion and soul searching thought provoking and credible. The Oscar nomination was well deserved and if he had won, it would have been no surprise (it went to Eddie Redmayne for Theory of Everything)<br/><br/>Norton also deserved the Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. His performance was rock solid as the super confident stage actor brought in by Keaton's character at the last minute. In fact, his role is at times in danger of stealing the film...a top performance and also worthy of the Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Finally, Emma Stone who plays Keaton's grumpy daughter must also get a mention. Superbly complex as the daughter who did not see enough of her dad when she was young. Unlike similar characters in other films, she balances the hard edge with vulnerability and confidence and similar to Keaton and Norton, provides an exceptional performance.....also also deserved the Oscar nomination. <br/><br/>The film resonates with life in so many ways. The challenges we all face dealing with different people trying to work towards the same goals....somehow, struggling as perspective and agenda gets in the way.

","""Birdman"" is a comedy drama directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and stars Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis and Edward Norton. Riggan Thomson, played by Keaton, is an actor on the last leg of his career. It has been 20 years since the original Birdman movie came out and made him a star. He has searched for relevance within his art ever since. His last chance at being remembered as anything other than Birdman comes in a theater adaptation of Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,"" which he wrote, and is directing and staring in. The play starts to fall apart and Thomson's psyche goes with it. He starts to imagine the character of Birdman as an alternate personality of his and the lines between reality and fantasy become more blurred. Michael Keaton is a man mostly known for one role. While many cinephiles will tell you the man has had a plethora of amazing characters to his name, there is one that still haunts him to this day, Batman (1989). Since then, he has become an actor fighting under the shadow of success, which makes him perfect for the role of Riggan Thomson. Keaton is beyond excellent in this film. It will be a crime if he does not win an Oscar for Best Actor this year. He brings sadness to his character and plight. The fight for relevance is something every creative person can relate to and he makes it even more heartbreaking. It is never truly stated whether Thomson sees truth or illusion. The character is constantly on the edge of a breakdown, he adds realism and believability to the fantasies around him. The acting in general is to be commended. Stone and Norton both give award-worthy performances as well. Stone plays Thomson's drug addicted daughter and Norton plays a fictional version of himself. Both play characters who, in the wrong hands would be deplorable, but they make them charming. There are many interesting and engaging aspects of this film. The continuous shots, the mixture between meta-realism and off-the-wall visuals and random moments of black comedy make it compelling. The meta-realism of this movie is present and sound. Many pieces of fiction fail at building a convincing world, but this movie never struggles with it. The superhero craze, the nature of critics and the personality of an actor are just some of the aspects of this movie which make it successful."

","Expecting more then an acting movie will only disappoint you. Birdman is a film so unique and clever— that you have to give it up to the actors. Keaton, for playing a character with such pain— a character with such a strive for success that no one else could have pulled off. Norton, for playing the charismatic and vein actor Mike, who eventually becomes the character that the audience looks forward too seeing the most. Stone, for playing the disturbed daughter, who delivers the most intense and well written monologue in the film. Finally, Watts, who delivers an actress who is trying to make it big in Hollywood role that was ""ok"". The camera shots were incredibly unique— giving the movie a sense of realism. The movie on its own was not as great. It is absorbed by messy drums, pounding louder and louder every time someone stops talking— and is washed out by the slow 30 minute ending that should have only been 10 minutes. Birdman found itself in a bizarre position, in which the first 40 minutes or so were great, but the 60 minutes left found itself redundant and dragging. It truly is an actors movie— one all actors surely will relate to. But not everyone (including me) is an actor, and the film fails to demonstrate a moral message that does not comply with only a certain group of people. Its dark humour may have saved it from drowning at the bottom of a lake— but it certainly was not as glorious as the other movies who lost to it at the Academy Awards.

","""Birdman"" is an outrageously divisive film.<br/><br/>Par for the course, I know, especially for an Oscar winner, but what I found peculiar about this particular case is the fact that this is a film I love that I could see myself absolutely hating if it was even slightly different or if I had a minutely altered mindset while watching it, and I don't mean this as an ""only I can appreciate true art"" stab at ""da hayturz"" (I honestly wouldn't do that to detractors or fans of the films/books I most overtly adore or despise; it's unbearably petty, arrogant and close-minded), but as a comment on the bizarre effect this one had on me.<br/><br/>What I mean by this is that, in my view, ""Birdman"" is an extremely inventive, entertaining and funny film undercut with a cynical streak that borders on condescension, and as a result the film spends its entire running time walking the tightrope that separates insight from self-importance, a mean-spirited attack on every entertainment industry in the world from a love-letter to theater and a borderline canonization of the individual killed by the industry that chewed him up and spat him out, and by the vicarious audience who deserted him.<br/><br/>Very good arguments can be made for either camp, and I have seen intelligent people defend both stances. what tips my personal scales toward favouring the ""yiss"" side is the generous peppering of self-deprecating humour throughout the film's running time. Mind you, I am not stating that a film not taking itself very seriously automatically makes it good, but ""Birdman"" has a refreshing penchant for deflating itself just at the right time, and this eases a lot of the (genuine) grievances people might have with it to the point where they virtually become non-issues to me.<br/><br/>Frankly, the only piece of advice I can give to anyone watching it is not to take the whole thing too seriously. The writers certainly didn't."

","Gotta say, with 400+ user reviews at this time, this comment is having trouble feeling significant!<br/><br/>But I gotta back up my rating, right? It's simple: The piece feels like the very best of fine theatre, coupled with tremendous filmmaking craft, and yet somehow floating free of the curse of detectable artifice.<br/><br/>This flick is an absolute jewel box of semantic riches, like a book that you can open randomly, plunk a finger down, and discover yet-another passage that blows your mind.<br/><br/>For example, I was just now reflecting on the scene where the hero faces off the critic in the bar. That scene is a mind-blower, in that it masterfully--if not seemingly inadvertently--mitigates against its own self. The woman decries the death of art, and does so with such force that we could overlook the fact of how that scene shimmers with deep and beautiful artistry.<br/><br/>OK, that's one example. This flick is both visual and experiential fine sculpture. In the same way that great sculpture invites you to brave its firehose of beautiful imagery as you circumambulate it, this film is a non-stop cavalcade of beautiful visual impressions and whirling, tumbling humanity.<br/><br/>As _Capote_ was for PSH, and _Kill Bill_ was for David Carradine, I sense that _Birdman_ could be the performance of a lifetime for Keaton.

","Birdman is a film that left me feeling truly raw as I walked out of the cinema the first night I saw it, in fact, I have been turning it over in my mind for the past two weeks since I witnessed the (obvious) best film of the year, picking apart the beautiful details. Now, there are only a few movies I will watch over again within the same year, but I saw Birdman in the cinema for a second time a week after my first viewing and bought it on Blu-Ray.<br/><br/>The cinematography is flawless, even revolutionary. Each scene seamlessly stitched together with passionate craftsmanship that can only be accomplished by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who recently won an Oscar for his work on Gravity. <br/><br/>Director Alejandro González Iñárritu has been quoted as saying that he intended for Birdman to be ""a cinematic desert."" And that is being modest. This movie truly feels like a breath of fresh air in the film industry because of its creativity and originality. Now, I have only given five other films a 10 out of 10 rating, this being the sixth. Those films include The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction and The Big Lebowski. <br/><br/>The technical aspect of this film is obviously extraordinarily noteworthy, but how is the acting? In one word. Radiant. Michael Keaton gives the performance of a lifetime as a washed up actor who's ego is far beyond what it should be. Emma Stone, Ed Norton and Zach Galifianakis have also never been better. In fact, they are all Oscar Worthy, except for maybe Zach Galifianakis, but that's only due to his abbreviated screen time. <br/><br/>I also loved how it touched on the expectations of movie goers today and their opinions on what they want to see when watching a blockbuster film,as well as film critics and how all they ever do is use big unnecessary words to avoid actually reviewing films and look for a good quotes to put on the posters and DVD covers.<br/><br/>I predict that this film will age very well and hopefully resonate in the thoughts of moviegoers and critics alike. And there is no reason why Birdman shouldn't sweep the 2015 Academy Awards."
"ironhorse_iv","8","7","20","2 February 2015"," The plot of Birdman will flew over, most audience member's head, but the stunning visuals, great acting and clever dialogue, will kept some viewers, grounded.
","Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a really hard movie to define, but I'll do my best. Best way to describe it, would be: Judy Funnie. It's a very weird movie. It's a 'beat' generation film movie trying to survive, in a world of action special effects blockbusters and social media. The movie has everything that a beatnik would love. The rejection of received standards, innovations in style, use of illegal drugs, alternative sexualities, an interest in religion, a rejection of materialism, and explicit portrayals of the human condition under the background of cool Jazz. Directed, produce, and written by Alejandro González Iñárritu of 2006's Babel, fame. The movie tells the story of Riggan Thomas (Michael Keaton), has-been actor, trying to recapture fame by staging a new retelling of a classic Broadway dramatic play called ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" by author Raymond Carver. For him to triumph, he has to overcome all of his challenges; like a method Broadway actor, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) who takes his acting craft way too seriously, family issues with his daughter, Samantha (Emma Stone) and his own personal demons. Will Riggan have a hit on his hands or will the play bombed? Watch the movie to find out! Anyways, without spoiling the movie, too much. The movie concept isn't anything new as it tells the story of comeback talent trying to resurgence his career. We seem movies like this before, in films like 2010's Black Swan & 2008's the Wrestler. The different between those and this, is the humor. This movie was indeed funny. Much of the charm for the film, comes from that. If it didn't had, that, this movie might not had work. Michael Keaton is great in the lead film. You really see, how much risk, Riggan's entire future rests on the success of this play. You really see Keaton synonymous of Riggans, because how much it mirrors Michael Keaton's real life drama. Like Riggan, Keaton was known best for playing superheroes like the Batman in the 1990s. Ever since then, he hasn't reach the success that he had, with those films. Like how Birdman haunt Riggan's mind; Batman somewhat does the same to Keaton. I can't see, anybody else for this role. For a movie call the Birdman, the movie focus way too much on supporting characters, like Samantha's love/hate relationship with Mike Shiner. I can do without that as it hurts the film structure. Its felt directionless at parts. Don't get me wrong, all the supporting cast is great. I love how much, a dick that Mike Shiner could be and Edward Norton is great in that role; but I really came to see this movie for Michael Keaton's role. I wish, the movie focus all of it, on him. The movie is also worth noting for its non-stop editing so as the movie appear to be, a single continuous shot through the use of long takes. It was pretty cool to see that. Remind me of 1948's Rope. The movie in many ways, was made for a Broadway play. I felt that, this movie would had work better in a theater settling, than a film. I'll tell you why. They are two different forms of entertainment, and both communicate differently, so when you forge one into the other, something is going to get lost in the translation. The movie was way too wordy. I was wishing for a more 'show' don't tell approach to the film. It doesn't allow the visuals to sink in. Even if it did, most of the visuals were too surreal to dream-like to make any sense. What does a comet, have to do with Riggan's career? Its random juxtaposition of dissociated image cinematography was a bit much and felt like jargon. The film's theme of illusion and reality, doesn't blend, well. Its message seem to fall apart, more and more, when the movie reach its final climax. In other films, this might be alright, but for a movie that has a Broadway play, feel. It needs a little more structure. At less, the movie didn't go, overboard with its special effects. Coming in, I thought, this film was a hollow superhero film about the cartoon series from the 1960s when I first heard of the title, but I was deeply surprise, how challenging, its examination of artistic integrity was. The movie dealt with ignorance for most of its run time. It has a strong satirical assault on what viewers should think of what is art, and what is entertainment. 'Look at how their eyes light up. People, they love blood. They love action. Not this talky, depressing, philosophical bullsh*t.' quote Birdman. I guess you can say that the movie serves as a critique of modern entertainment. I'll give the movie, credit, for that. Is this a smart art house film or dada like film? Does it purposely tricks the audience into thinking it is very intellect, when it's not. Is the movie very shallow, despite its symbolism like the drummer and the title superhero? It's really up to you. The movie bad mouths 'critics', because it wants people to be, more critical thinkers and think for themselves, than allowing the general masses to make the decision for them. Don't get me wrong, I will still state my opinion, but I give the movie, credit for showing that what critics say, shouldn't stop you from seeing or not seeing a movie. Overall: I didn't think this film was that great of a film, but the movie will indeed, win a few Academy Awards, when the time comes. The movie was a fantastic piece of acting and cinematography that had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Story wise. I just wish, it was a little more tighten. It need a little more work. Still, worth checking out."
"rossangela","10","7","20","17 January 2015"," ""The Triumph of Art and the Artist"" - One of the top films of the past 10 years
","For persons with a strong aesthetic sensibility, the film Birdman instantly draws them into its artistic ambiance. Before any words are spoken, we hear the sounds of a jazz drummer beating out a message of HERE and NOW, giving the opening scenes an immediacy that must be the first element of the creation of art. The fact that the film is set in a theater, where immediacy is the name of the game, strongly establishes this theme. Instances of this also appear in scenes such as the one in which Riggan, the main character, tells himself to ""breathe in, breathe out,"" a technique used in forms of meditation and mindfulness training to bring the subject to the present moment. <br/><br/>Riggan Thomson, played intensely and sublimely by Michael Keaton, is the story's protagonist. He had been a Hollywood superhero film star twenty years earlier, but now attempts serious art by writing, directing and acting in a challenging intellectual drama on Broadway at the St. James Theater, where this film was shot. Some other critics have described Riggan as a""washed-up"" Hollywood actor, but events in the film do not support this claim. For example, one guy gets really excited to think that Riggan might make a ""Birdman 4"" movie. Another asks for his autograph, and a woman in a bar wants a photo taken with him. The intent was to show that he still had adoring fans, was commercially successful, and could have continued to be, but he quit voluntarily and now, much later, wants to prove himself as a ""real"" actor in the risky immediacy of the live stage drama. <br/><br/>Riggan is not just an actor but an everyman, certainly an ""any artist"", who struggles with self- doubt on the way to artistic self-expression. The great scene when Riggan wrestles with his alter ""birdman"" ego and in the process destroys his dressing room is actually a mechanism to show the battle between the forces of commercial schlock, represented by the big birdman character, versus true art, represented by Riggan and his desire to be taken seriously as a Broadway director, writer, and actor.<br/><br/>The film plays out on several levels, and within each level, there exists content and issues that educate, illuminate, and pose questions, making it a intellectual and aesthetic masterpiece. The ontological levels the film presents are not even mentioned by most critics. There are at least four fundamental co-existing levels:<br/><br/>First, the discourse or message level where various views are expressed and statements made. This certainly exists in the strained interactions between Riggan and his stage foil, Michael Shiner, played by Ed Norton. As another example, Sam, Reggin's existentialist and rebellious daughter, presents the generation gap by pointing out that cyberspace determines relevancy, not the lily-white, bourgeois theater of Reggin's distant past, nor his current quest for recognition and appreciation. She even denounces his quest as self-delusory, and insists that no one even cares, and that he is not so important, begging the question ""Is anyone?"" <br/><br/>Then there is the verismo level of daily life, seen from backstage where an actor's perspective exposes the industrial or ""plant-level"" nature of the theater. The continuous filming as actors move through hallways, rooms and various areas of the theater gives one the experience of being there, another element lending an immediacy to the rhythm of the shots.<br/><br/>The aesthetic level where the directing, acting, writing, camera work, special effects, and just raw comic energy are all excellent. Keaton and Norton deserve best actor and supporting actor awards for their superb portrayals. Zach Galifianakis expands his acting talents successfully in a well-played dramatic role as Riggan's best friend and lawyer. Emma Stone, as Riggan's daughter gives an honest, intense and convincing performance worthy of a best supporting actress award. Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough, and Amy Ryan all contribute their outstanding acting abilities to the story's success. All those players behind the camera, especially the director, Alejandro Inarritu, and the Director of Phototgrapy, Emmanuel Lubezki, must be commended for their magnificent work. Together they have created a very real story of conflict, struggle, ambition, self-doubt and creative ambition. <br/><br/>Alongside this very real story there also exists a surreal co-story, in which seemingly impossible things occur. But even within the surreal level there is an evolution between the early birdman inner voice that denounces Riggan's interest in theatrical acting and directing and the later inner birdman voice that wants Riggan to use his superpowers in the theater at least as a last grand gesture, a ""we'll show"" them kind of approach. This is no more and no less than the true artist calling upon his or her most hidden, inner powers to persevere in the face of public ridicule, derision, and misunderstanding. It is the triumph of art and the artist.<br/><br/>Many reviews have missed the mark on this film, possibly because those writers really don't have a clue about the process of artistic creation. A good example of this is David Nussair's critique of Birdman on a site called reelfilm. I won't use space here to pick apart his very weak and uninspired piece, but just to say that he was unable to ""get"" this multi-layered, profound work of art. Even the majority of the critics at the New York Times haven't understood the genius of this film. It is the hope of this reviewer that those who are in a position to bestow awards will realize that, even with all the other fine films of 2014, Birdman is the number one film of the year."
"jason-ineman","9","7","20","16 January 2015"," I don't get what the hate is for
","I went into this film with the expectation of being highly impressed or highly disappointed, and it was most definitely the former. The execution of everything was flawless from the cinematography to Keaton's hauntingly moving performance. I read many negative reviews that said the film was too pretentious or that the plot moved too slowly. All I can say is that those people just prove Birdman's genius. You don't want to watch a movie with an accurate representation of American society and instead curl up with Michael Bay's Transformers because you're so stimulated by the CGI be my guest. The movie satirizes itself so brilliantly that it even points out its own drab depiction of theater, saying that all people care about are multimillion dollar films with action and destruction; not the skill of acting, writing, or directing. Keaton succeeds in rejuvenating the seemingly lost art of theater while giving his career a return to greatness. Whether you hated this film or loved it, everyone can agree that its depiction of humanity's inflated ego was met with some humility and made you think long and hard after viewing. Bravo, Birdman. You created something worth talking about, and that's all that we needed from this movie."
"DeanBenedetti","10","8","24","5 November 2014"," Birdman Is An Instant Classic
","I can't remember the last time I've so passionately loved a film. Walking out of the theater, I was literally weak in the knees. <br/><br/>Birdman is everything I love about film as an art form: it's bold, incredibly original, emotionally rich, gorgeously shot, and unmistakably energetic and alive. It's about how art and life are hopelessly intertwined, how people's lives, egos, opinions, have all become clichés of art, people searching for true meaning and social acceptance in the murky battleground of the stage, fantasy vs reality, past vs present, popularity vs prestige, criticism of criticism, the jumble of life's mysteries. Birdman balances these ideas beautifully and delivers them ferociously, angrily. The characters constantly rant and rave to each other about how phony everyone is, about who is most passionate and real, how theater audience are rich white people whose only care is where they're going to eat after the show, how movie audiences are morons who only care about shootouts and superheroes. These ideas are bitter and acerbic and they're the true heart of the film. One of my very favorite scenes features Sam, Riggan's daughter, explaining to him how a roll of toilet paper that has 150 dots on each square, each dot symbolizing 100,000 years, is like the history of Earth. Sam says that humans represent only a single square of toilet paper on the entire roll, which really puts into perspective just how self-obsessed we are and how all of our self-doubt and truth-searching are ultimately meaningless in the grand scheme of things; how if humans are negligible, so is art, and vice versa. We're only as meaningful as we say we are: this is an idea displayed in the movie by Riggan's ability to bend the laws of physics. Sometimes, he genuinely believes he has the powers of his superhero alter ego, and by simply believing, he possesses these abilities. This is just incredible! I could go on for pages about the films themes and ideas, but it also has an extremely impressive technical side to discuss. <br/><br/>The experience of Birdman is like a stream-of-consciousness jazz piece that lasts for 2 hours and doesn't let up or slacken for a moment. Alejandro Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki (probably the greatest cinematographer of our generation) shot Birdman in what is mainly supposed to look like one uninterrupted take. Similar to Hitchcock's Rope, but the one-take technique is both more captivating and meaningful in this case. It brings a strange surrealism to the whole experience which highlights the blending of real life with fantasy/art. The constantly moving and unblinking camera eye also does wonders in making the audience feel like they themselves are part of the story, a genuinely brilliant decision that rewards attentive viewers with a unique, transcendent experience. The score is almost entirely percussive and feels much like the pulse of Birdman. When the camera is moving and so are the characters, the drums kick in, but when the camera is still and the tone turns dramatic or melancholy, they sputter out. <br/><br/>Now, on to the performances, and this is a huge category. The entire cast is brilliant and there are absolutely no exceptions. The players themselves are like jazz musicians that feed off of each other's vibes and energy to create some kind of sweeping, orchestral odyssey. Michael Keaton and Edward Norton are arguably playing exaggerated versions of themselves, which adds to the innumerable layers of satire already at work. Keaton as Riggan shows off his entire acting range and gives what is without a doubt the best performance I've seen from him. Norton is more of a straight-up douche, but he still radiates intelligence and a mysterious yearning. Zach Galifianakis is one of those comedians that I thought could be a great dramatic actor if he wanted to, and my thoughts were confirmed with his small, impressive performance here . Emma Stone shocked me with her powerful yet intimate portrayal of Riggan's young, ex-drug addict daughter and delivers Birdman's most memorable ranting scene as well as some of the film's most tantalizing and thought- provoking bits. The extraordinary female cast is rounded out with great efforts by Naomi Watts, Amy Ryan, Andrea Riseborough, and Lindsay Duncan. <br/><br/>I'm elated to have finally seen Birdman. My expectations were high going in but were completely blown away, which almost never happens. Iñarritu and company have created a funny, exciting, thought-provoking, and all around jaw-dropping masterpiece that deserves every award it's got coming to it. Birdman is the best of the 216 movies I've seen so far this year, and is generally one of the best movie-going experiences I've ever had. Easiest 10 I think I've ever given."
"bjbjlb71","6","5","13","20 February 2015"," Definitely overrated
","Don't get me wrong, this film is definitely different and does some things very well. I think Ed Norton is fantastic, the back and forth between Keaton and Norton is worth seeing. Keaton definitely has his moments as well. Certainly buy into his character, his interaction with the critic is a great scene. However the scenes where he's responding to his alter ego/split personality ""birdman"" are little forced? By that, I mean the director seems to say- we are going to literally make you listen to the internal dialogue this character is having with himself to illustrate his personal struggle. I didn't need the dialogue to illustrate the struggle and found it a bit irritating? Just my opinion. Along those lines...I found the jazz drumming over the dialogue a little frustrating as well, to the point I had to put on subtitles. This movie was watchable, a good movie but for me not a 'must see' or an Oscar Nominee for my money. I really think this is a down year for films. Not to get into the other nominees, but Boyhood is incredibly overrated, Grand Budapest Hotel is another ""different"" movie that probably would not have been nominated in other years. Seems like the academy really bought into the 'it's different it must be good' theory this year which is a little unfortunate for us viewers. That being said I totally agree with the Academy on The Imitation Game however and feel it was the best movie of the bunch. Cumberbatch was terrific."

","When you set out to submit your stories to publishers, many magazine's guidelines tell you not to send them stories about what it's like to be a struggling writer or to have writer's block, that this is bad, lazy writing. If you don't have a real work of fiction to share, keep your insecurities in your personal journals. My second definition of bad writing is to write about what it would be like if you were a great writer, the effect you would have on the world, and the accolades that come with it. Again, there is no story with this kind of writing. It's just an authors fantasy, the easy to way to write when you can't weave an actual story.<br/><br/>Birdman epitomizes these realms of bad writing; one of not being an actualized artist as well as delusions of grandeur. (Do not mistake the monologues of the play the actors perform in the movie for the screenwriter's writings, they are Raymond Carver's)<br/><br/>All in all, Birdman was a lot of fun, but obvious. Performances were awesome. Some good, honest, dialogue. Humbled writing. Good energy.<br/><br/>Hate endings that are left open for interpretation. And this was a doozy.

","Riggan Thomson is an actor whose big moment was as superhero Birdman in 3 movies 20 years ago. He is hoping to establish some late-career acting bona-fides by writing, directing and starring in a self-financed Broadway adaptation of a cult novel. Opening night is soon, things are not going well, and a late cast substitution brings in Mike, enormously talented but somewhat dangerous. Then factor in Riggan's daughter Sam, still smouldering with childhood resentments, acting as his assistant, developments in relationships with other cast members, concerns over what the most influential Broadway critic will say, and Riggan's own ongoing dialogue with the Birdman character he resents.<br/><br/>This is possibly the most odd film I have ever tried to write a review for. The synopsis above presents a relatively straightforward linear dramatic narrative about theatrical goings-on. But the narrative is possibly the least significant element of the film: far more important is the way the narrative is presented, which is effectively one continuous take stretching over several days (with some tricks such as time lapse to move time along). Director Alejandro Inarritu's camera is constantly moving, always gracefully, and is blessed with some phenomenal edits and unnoticeable digital transitions – the special effects here are nothing short of miraculous, yet hardly noticeable.<br/><br/>The film is described as a comedy: it certainly isn't, despite some amusing moments. That is (arguably) part of the problem: it doesn't conveniently fit into any sort of category, not least because it is largely an exercise in pure cinema rather than a story.<br/><br/>The performances are all very good: I didn't feel Oscar calling, though.<br/><br/>I have seen it called pretentious. There are those who love it. But it is possible to admire it without necessarily liking it very much, and some may find it utterly bewildering. All of these are absolutely valid reactions to it, and I felt all of them at different times as the movie progressed. But the one thing I can say with certainty is that it is completely original, and anyone with a love of cinema should experience it."

If I was capable of crying I would have shed a tear at its ending, making me jubilant of the direction the ending eventually takes.<br/><br/>To understand Birdman you must realize that once millions of people adore you as a fictional superstar you start believing the hype.

"MOscarbradley","9","5","13","2 January 2015"," Keaton's Oscar should be in the bag
","Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's ""Birdman"" is one of the great films about the theatre and about acting. Ironically, if it has a fault it's that the play within the film isn't really that good, (but then they never are; if they were they would exist as plays in their own right). That aside, in every other respect, this is a sublime film that manages to poke fun at the current fad of movie stars attempting to prove they are really actors and not just celebrities by strutting their stuff upon the stage while at the same time honoring the whole concept of what it means to be an actor in the first place as well as giving us a crash course in what it takes to put a straight play on Broadway.<br/><br/>The straight play in question is an adaptation of Raymond Carver's collection of short stories ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" and the man staging it, and starring in it, is Riggan Thompson, a once famous film star who made his name playing the titular superhero Birdman and who pulled the plug on his own career by refusing to do ""Biridman 4"". The play is a psychodrama with a central character searching for love and himself and finding neither and it seems to mirror Riggan's own life. He's got an ex-wife, a druggy daughter and a co-star who happens to be a Broadway 'name' (and the bigger draw) and who seems to be hi-jacking the play. The film's also a comedy and often a very funny one and is certainly the best thing Inarritu has done since ""Amores Perros"".<br/><br/>Michael Keaton is Riggan and he is magnificent. Keaton himself has been something of a spent force in the cinema recently so you might say he has put a good deal of himself into the role. Whatever, this is a career-best performance that should see him pick up a well-deserved Oscar next month. Indeed, no-one in this movie puts a foot wrong. As the vain Broadway star Edward Norton hasn't been this good in years. Emma Stone is superb as the daughter and as other Broadway types Zach Galifianikis, Amy Ryan, Andrea Riseborough, Naomi Watts and Lindsay Duncan add to the brilliant ensemble.<br/><br/>It's also superbly photographed by Emmanuel Lubezki whose continually swooping, roaming camera gives the impression of it all being done in one long, continuous take. Here is a movie that really soars, both literally and metaphorically; a film about the theatre that is unashamedly cinematic. (There's one astonishing moment when Inarritu, and Keaton, play their biggest scene off-screen). This is the kind of intelligent entertainment that restores one's faith in movies and it really shouldn't be missed."
"jaclyn-144-759583","9","5","13","16 November 2014"," What does a former James Bond, Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker do when a younger, stronger actor takes his place on the screen?
","Birdman brings a whole new ""magic to the movies"" that I haven't felt in a very long time. CGI and other amazing talented movie makers have given us the middle earth (Lord of the Rings) and realistic twin brothers (The Social Network). It's not a bad thing at all -- we are living in such an amazing time for movies and TV shows. That said, rarely do I walk away from a movie completely in awe of how it was made.<br/><br/>Enter Birdman. While there is some CGI to it, it's the camera-work that is truly outstanding. It's like watching a play in front of your eyes, the camera never breaks as it walks you though the story. No second shots. No fades to black. It's as if the actors and crew had a one-day shoot with quick costume changes and breaks between the scenes. Please spend your hard earned money supporting this movie at your local theater -- even if it's just to appreciate and support the talented folks behind the cameras that made this movie.<br/><br/>Now for the folks on screen -- amazing. Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts and Ed Norton. I have a personal motto when it comes to movies ... ""If Ed Norton is in, I'm in"". Of course he wouldn't let me down. Yet again he comes to the screen with some of the best acting I've seen. After watching Naomi Watts play a Russian stripper in St. Vincent, it was awesome to see her in a completely different role a Broadway actress struggling with confidence on and off the stage. Emma Stone was brilliant. Not only would she be a great friend to have ... she is proving herself as not just a pretty face but a talented actress who I see getting a golden statue someday.<br/><br/>And Michael Keaton -- we've missed you. What a wonderful comeback story to bring to us. His real-life comparison playing Batman over 20 years ago made this movie eerily creepy in a touching way. But Keaton was not only great because he once himself a Birdman, he was great because he is a great. A few times I did hear a bit of Beetlejuice in his rants, which brought back more fond Keaton-memories.<br/><br/>I felt a lot of vulnerability from Keaton. It seemed personal. And there is nothing better than genuineness on and off screen. Keaton, Stone, Norton - they gave it their all.<br/><br/>You may love this movie, you may not. It is a true independent film -- if you're favorite movies are Hollywood blockbusters this is not going to be on top of the list. However I still encourage you to see this movie. It's an interesting story about life after big Hollywood (think modern-day Sunset Blvd.). What does a former James Bond, Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker do when a younger, stronger actor takes his place on the screen? After watching Birdman, you may even have a bit more respect for our childhood superheroes and their courage after the sets are closed."
"smatson123","8","5","13","8 November 2014"," Wholly original and well played, with universal themes (if not universal appeal)
","Ambitious, messy, confusing, over-the-top; there is merit in all of these criticisms, if you look at Birdman from the bottom up. Several issues loom, in that respect. For example, for an overly long two hours, viewers are forced to run through the claustrophobia-inducing hallways of a theater as a troupe of actors prepares to put on a play, despite infighting and other setbacks. Outside, the cinematography flows seamlessly, with brilliant effects, thanks to Emmanual Lubezki, but seemingly separate from a consistent story line. The actors and casting were spot on, if few characters are inherently likable (Ed Norton as antagonist Mike is as stereotypically self- absorbed as you'd expect any heralded celebrity to be, for example). Setting is fully familiar, with Broadway memorably represented, but related scenes, like protagonist Riggan (Michael Keaton) being forced to run through crowds in his underwear to make his stage scene on time, seem tacked on to add needed humor to a story about a man on the edge. <br/><br/>But what happens if you consider the plot from top down? What if, like a soaring Birdman, the Superhero that Riggan once so successfully and lucratively played on film, you could see Riggan's world all at once? Here's the essence of the story. A man who spent years being self deluded as to his own importance and place in the world attempting re-entry in his last viable years as a respectable stage actor. is going through a life transition to determine exactly what his final legacy will be. He desperately must reinvent himself for his daughter, Sam (waif-like Emma Stone), his ex-wife, his current girlfriend, and a harshly judgemental theater critic. It's his last gasp. He looks in the mirror repeatedly after removing all manner of wigs and disguises, only to see an aging face and vanishing capabilities. At the same time, his still-vibrant imagination convinces him that he can move objects, even hurl furniture at the walls, through sheer force of will. Decades ago, an obscure salesman named Willy Loman faced a similar challenge. In Miller's play, he clings to memories of long-ago but now irrelevant successes in order to believe, and convince others, that he still matters. Audiences rooted for Loman in all of his ego-blindedness and flaws, knowing he was, after all, Every Man. When do we say it's over? Wouldn't we really rather, as Riggan says passionately to his hostile critic, ""kill ourselves"" so that the play can go on? And so we can re-invent ourselves, before all the minutes run out?<br/><br/>This is the theme that pulls Birdman together in the end. Keaton, who was woefully under-appreciated in a number of roles--Clean and Sober is just one of many examples-- nails the essence of what director Inarritu has set out to do, above and beyond the flaws that sometimes occur when a talented director is overly ambitious. Sit back--be patient--look for the big picture--and look for solid mentions (in acting, cinematography) at Oscar time."

Many scenes appear to be one long take of five or ten minutes in a run. the edits but they are hidden, disguised and sublime. This gives the movie an energy that just pulsates.<br/><br/>the trailers and TV spots show us some super-hero stuff, explosions and such, but those elements take up maybe fifteen seconds of the movie itself and are used only for very specific emphasis (Keaton is imagining them)<br/><br/>every performance is award-caliber....not a stumble, not a miss.

","Birdman is an ambitious film with great performances and excellent camera-work. The movie revolves around an actor, who famously portrayed a superhero(funnily enough, Keaton acted as Batman in the 90s), struggling to make it in the theatre world. What's fascinating about the movie is that you feel as if the movie is taken in 1 take, not kidding, 1 take. There are no cuts, no edits, as you continue to track all the actors from day to night and back to day. Editing is little rough, but the camera-work is superb and so is the performances. Keaton delivers one of his best and honest performances, and I wont be surprised if he gets an Oscar nomination. Definitely worth a look."
"lee_eisenberg","9","4","10","8 March 2015"," fickle industry leads to a very interesting movie
","Alejandro González Iñárritu's ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" recently won Best Picture. Now that I've seen ""Birdman"", it's going to take some explaining. Michael Keaton stars as a washed-up actor known for playing a superhero - sounds like a reference to Keaton's role as Batman, doesn't it? - attempting a comeback by starring in a Broadway adaptation of a Raymond Carver story. The actor is nearly at the end of his rope, exacerbated by the people surrounding him. Meanwhile, the superhero won't leave him alone.<br/><br/>The movie is filmed primarily as one long shot, as though the audience is directly witnessing the action. And boy is there some action to witness! Overall the movie focuses on the entertainment industry's fickleness (of which the industry's ageism is a symptom), the issue of typecasting, and the abundant egomania. As Samantha tells Riggan, the play is a vanity project. The movie gets more and more surreal as it progresses, with the contrast between Riggan's mental breakdown and presumed superpowers growing more apparent.<br/><br/>I don't know whether or not this was 2014's best movie. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and ""Boyhood"" were also really good, but I haven't seen many of last year's movies. But without a doubt I can say that Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography deserved its win. In the end this is a movie that I highly recommend. And I hope that everyone paid attention to Alejandro González Iñárritu's reminder that the United States is an immigrant nation."

How he directed birdman was something very special and something I've never seen before. He shot birdman so it was one shot throughout the whole movie. The performances were so great by everyone. Of course Micheal Keaton did an amazing job playing this washed up superhero star. Edward Norton and Emma Stone did a great job but one performance that was a surprise was Zach Galifianakis. We are used to him playing a funny role but here he played a serious role and he knock it out of the park. Overall Birdman was a great drama, with some funny moments but it's performances and the way it's directed makes it worth being nominated for an Oscar."
"bethtesfaye","9","4","10","15 February 2015"," DISCLAIMER: this is NOT an actual superhero movie
","I think this movie was one of the most thought out and beautifully executed movies I've seen all year. While watching it, I felt the same way I do when reading a magical realist novel by Murakami or Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Everything from the phenomenal casting and performances of the actors to the almost exclusively jazz drum-solo fueled soundtrack all worked together to create the atmospheric experience that was watching Birdman. <br/><br/>One of the major complaints of this movie from the general audience was that nothing really happened, that the plot was roundabout and confusing. Which is true, to a certain extent. So if you are looking for an actual action/superhero movie with a distinct plot line and a recognizable close then this movie is not for you.<br/><br/>However, I do not see anything wrong or bad about this movie not being plot-driven, especially since it never pretended it would be. The obvious focus of this movie is, and was from the first few minutes, portraying as realistically as possible the main character's (Michael Keaton's) post- Hollywood, late-life, existential crisis and struggle with relevancy and the importance of being relevant in this technology-driven, fast paced, attention deficit modern age. Everything about this movie was dedicated to making the audience understand and even somewhat experience this struggle.<br/><br/>And that's just the first layer. There are SOO many layers behind this movie. Let's start from the bottom and build it up. As I previously mentioned there's Keaton, famously known for playing Batman in Batman 1 and 2, is cast to play Riggan, a still recognizable but ex-Hollywood star who ended his career at Birdman 2. The parallels are already too real. In a desperate attempt to validate his lifelong career and devotion to acting as something substantial, Riggan risks his built-up reputation, funds, and self-dignity with an ambitiously self-written, self-directed, and self- starring play on Broadway, a rendition of ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". As the movie goes on and we see more of Riggan's character and back story as well as learn more about the play, some similarities become apparent. So right now we have an ex-superhero actor playing a washed out superhero-actor playing a man who is desperately looking for love, almost redundant right? <br/><br/>All the supporting characters are loosely developed and sporadically involved with Riggan's main story line but each have their own individual shining moments where their intense, emotional and maybe even overly- dramatic performances take the stage. Laura's confusing pregnancy reveal, Sam's cutting outburst after Riggan catches her smoking pot, Shiner's first hard-on in 6 months, to name a few. Until these evocative moments, these characters served as stock characters to facilitate the complexity of the main character. But these raw performances reveal the independence of their characters from Keaton's and how they have their own place in the over arching narrative. <br/><br/>Then the cinematography and mechanics of this movie take it even further. The ""one shot"" filming of the movie makes it feel like you are experiencing everything first hand in real time, almost like you are watching a play and not a movie. A feeling that is further emphasized by the staging of the production: almost exclusively the backstage and on stage of an actual Broadway theatre. Even the minimal use of back music, if not a single jazz drum playing beats and unrecognizable tunes either in the transition between dialogues or building up the intensity of certain moments, dramatic orchestral pieces from the staged play are the soundtrack to the story.<br/><br/>The play format of this movie allowed it to constantly blur the line between performance and reality for the audience, a nice parallel with Riggan's struggle between delusion and reality. The reoccurring narration of Riggan's thoughts by Birdman was a reminder to the audience that we are watching a written performance while to Riggan himself, it became a constant reminder that his feelings were not based in reality, ""its a mental formation"" he would tell himself. The occasional appearance of the jazz drummer on screen also serves as a reminder to us that this is not real life. However, this message becomes confused when Riggan starts interacting with him, giving him spare change on the street and even telling the doorman outside of the theater to turn the music off, revealing that for Riggan, his mental formations are becoming real life. As Riggan becomes more delusional, even the audience becomes unsure about what Riggan is imagining and what is actually happening in the story. By the end, it's unclear whether Riggan has succumbed to his fatalistic delusions or has actually proved us all wrong and finally ascended to the higher being that has always been inside him. <br/><br/>Who knows? But it doesn't really matter either way, because feeling that uncertainty between delusion and reality is what I believe was what Alejandro González Iñárritu's intended to be the main takeaway from the movie, as well as is what I thought made this movie so worth watching."
"jason24691","6","4","10","7 February 2015"," I get this film, But that doesn't make it a masterpiece.
","It's been a while since i have written a review on a film, but this one has compelled me to do so again. Most of you will know what the film is about and it tries to be ironic, but it doesn't quite pull it off. For those of you that don't know what the film is about, well it's about an ageing actor that has taken to Broadway, but is often reminded of his one big film ""Birdman"". I get the artistic angle as you get the feel of the camera shooting the entire film in one sequence. I get the irony of actors making fun of their own profession. And we all have that voice of doubt in our heads. But what the film doesn't seem to get it's not THAT good, I mean it's OK to watch once but its probably 30 minutes too long and it is pretty boring. I understand critics saying its breathtaking or it should win Oscars, but they would as it is their industry it's their lifestyle so they would like it, and I get the feeling that it was made for the critics. For the average film lover don't waste your money or time on this film until it comes on the TV."
"faustiel","9","4","10","7 January 2015"," Was pleasantly surprised and haters
","Gonna hate I suppose. I was expecting something different after watching the trailers and agonizing over the release of this{for over a year} yet what I watched was amazing. This is one of those movies I guess people are going to be in either category of love or hate. As I mentioned this was not what I thought it was going to be but it is an amazing piece of cinema. And there in lies the problem; It is a great film and has superb acting, cinematography and the soundtrack is wildly ear pleasing relevant to the movie. Unfortunately you have the comic book movie crowd seeing this thinking ""OH YEAH A MICHAEL KEATON ACTION SUPER HERO MOVIE!!"" and they were wrong. This movie was brilliant. Well acted amazingly shot and very thought provoking. Its a sad day in cinema when people can't watch a movie like this and compare it to iron man or the avengers. Don't get me wrong, I love comic book movies; I geek out every time DC or Marvel announce a new film and I read a lot of comics; I also watch a lot of other movies from a lot of genres and this was a true gem. In short this was as I said not what I was expecting yet I was glued to the screen and loved every minute of it. People that are complaining are missing the point I think and were expecting something different like I was and are not aware of what true cinema and art are. In summation a wonderfully written and directed movie and many actors and actresses deserve all the award nods {and hopefully a few wins } they deserve."
"evanobrien100","8","4","10","6 January 2015"," Ambitious, audacious and soulful
","Birdman is like being introduced to a new kind of music or experimental art form with its own internal rhythm. This is entirely due to its unique cinematography by the brilliant Emmanuel Lubezki and especially how it's edited to give the illusion of one continuous take. It helps create a loosely directed, loosely blocked film that feels so improvised yet is a work of incendiary intention.<br/><br/>If there is one quality that this film does not possess it's the ability to allow itself to settle. The long takes, tracking shots and lines of dialogue are so quick and snappy it doesn't allow the depth of the themes to grip the viewer in the way that it should. This I suspect will improve upon repeat viewings, yet is somewhat of a mitigating issue. There are also one or two moments that doe require the viewer to take a bit of a leap of faith and the suspension of disbelief. The screenplay is also wickedly funny; it contains many sharp unsettling one liners that provoke howls of searing laughter.<br/><br/>It has distant echoes of previous classic Hollywood movies about marginalized actors in the vein of ""Sunset Boulevard"" this frame of reference was also used in the overly adulated awards hit ""The Artist"". It has some of the psychological deliriousness and fantastical realism present in ""Black Swan"". There are also sprinklings of the hilarious calamity and opportunistic ambition of ""The Producers"" these as I have previously mentioned are but distant echoes. The film does feel totally unique and original; I can't say for certain if it makes the viewing experience of the film better or worse for the casual viewer.<br/><br/>The question that lies at its core is if its originality is what makes it a masterpiece or a floundering piece of pretentious comedy art. I personally really enjoyed it; it's a terrifically unique viewing experience, it may just prove irksome to the viewer with a passive interest unfortunately.<br/><br/>The standout performances here are those of Michael Keaton and Edward Norton. Keaton's character Riggan Thompson is ""staging"" one last attempt at relevancy by writing, directing, financing and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's Novel ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" Riggan is a washed up movie stay who acquired fame for playing the titular ""Birdman"" a series of superhero movies from the 90's. As Norton's character mentions in the film it's clear that ""popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige."" The film contains some scathing indictments and lambasting of the critical community. Riggan berates a critic at one stage shouting about how all she cares about are buzzwords that help to sell magazines and that structure and technique are not evaluated and not given the appropriate weighting to form the critical consensus. This comes after the critic explains to Riggan how she detests his Hollywood acquired sense of self entitlement and self- importance with the lofty presumptions of Broadway success.<br/><br/>The interactions between Keaton and Norton's characters are also outstanding there are multiple occasions where they come to blows or get underneath each other's skin in the most childish and petty ways possible.<br/><br/>Norton plays a character that is largely a riff off of himself. He is a critically adored, egomaniacal actor one with a massive persona and is difficult to work with. Norton often gets drunk, criticizes the production at any given opportunity, sexually harasses and demeans the actresses and assistants both on and off stage. His drunken explosions of brutal, catastrophic obstinence are a sight to behold. Norton is the best he's been in years. Riggan's hallucinogenic breakdowns are also wonderful with his Birdman persona whispering murmurs of self-doubt in his ear. His alter ego declares his play to be overly pretentious with dumb lines such as ""The kind of love I'm talking about is absolute"" and ""I don't exist"". This sets Riggan into a hilarious downhill spiral of mindless delirium of all shades.<br/><br/>In essence Birdman is a movie that is hard to quantify because it contains so many elements that make it so wholly original yet are somewhat inherently problematic in certain small ways. It's not the seminal film for the industry, yet is one that is necessary to help shake up Hollywood's culture and the money grabbing image created movies that it produces. It has most certainly earned its reputation through its monstrously ambitious relentless technical prowess. It is backed up by a well observed, inspired and intelligent screenplay that adds a great amount of heft."

","Went to see this after only briefly watching the trailer and here's my advice - ignore the trailer. <br/><br/>This is not a superhero film. I won't go into the nitty gritty of what makes this a great film as that would spoil all the nice little ""is that real?"" touches.<br/><br/>The film has a simple premise - an ex-movie star who was Birdman in a multi-billion dollar franchise (20 years previous) decides, for reasons you need to decide on, to restart his career in theatre.<br/><br/>He's written a play based on a short story by Raymond Carvers and is also directing, producing and starring in it. He's sunk everything into this play, money, spirit, sanity and will do anything to make it a success.<br/><br/>It's a slow film to build but that's fine, it tells an unfolding story of a man plagued by all sorts of demons but he's got a supportive group around him (for the most part)<br/><br/>I personally think that this is Keaton's finest acting. It shows what he can do when all the special effects and silly comedy is stripped away.<br/><br/>Edward Norton turns in a fine performance as the supporting actor role (in both the film and the play) - Mike. Riggan & Mike have a sort of love/hate relationship and the dialogues between Keaton & Norton are brilliant.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast are great and my favourite scene is where Riggan confronts the critic Tabitha. I think every actor out there would agree 100% with what he says to her.<br/><br/>For a film that is about an actor who played a superhero, I think it's interesting how the main actors have played major roles in superhero movies : Michael Keaton - Batman Edward Nolan - The Hulk<br/><br/>(Might be coincidence!)<br/><br/>This is a film that you have to work at, it's full of discord (take the clashy drums in the background) and a LOT of dialogue. The film hardly ever leaves the theatre.<br/><br/>If you need a nice story tied up in a bow with lots of action and a happy ending, you won't like this. The final scene is reminiscent of Inception, you'll see why.....<br/><br/>But if you like a film with flawed characters, great dialogue and brilliantly acted then you can't go wrong with Birdman. My son is 15 and finds films like this hard to sit through (Mr Fidget!) but at the end he said it was a great film.<br/><br/>There are so many wonderful little nuances that I think I might need to watch it again.<br/><br/>Enjoy...."

Suicidal or reality-challenged people. There's just a little too much romance with self-slaughter. The film makes its comedy bones on really bleak and sometimes cringe-worthy situations. There are only four flat-out sight gags that I counted, and even those aren't cheap laughs.<br/><br/>I gave it a 9, only because I don't think there was enough of Lindsay Duncan's character's arc to power her conflict with Michael Keaton's character.

","It's been a few weeks since I've seen this and it keeps sticking in my mind, which is normally a sign that you've seen something great. However with this, even though I keep thinking about it, the more I do the more I seem to come down to the idea that maybe I didn't like it as much as I could have, or maybe I didn't like the point of it.<br/><br/>The film is fantastic to watch, the acting is great, the dialogue is mostly decent, the direction is brilliant. The whole thing is meant to look like it's one shot and it's done well. The camera movement is always interesting and substantive, and I'm amazed when I think about how much planning and blocking and overall thought must have gone into shooting the film the way they did, it's really amazing.<br/><br/>My problem is more with the story, or maybe the thematic elements, I'm not sure they hold up to scrutiny. This is a film about shallow people, which is fine, but even with this as a topic I think you need to dive into some sort of depth of character. There are times when the film does this in ways that are at least interesting, if not all that deep,but it never does anything conclusive with these explorations.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the film, Riggin, the main character,is going off the deep end, but we get less and less of his character as he does this. We get the idea that he is retreating into his shallow obsessions more and more, retreating into fantasy until it consumes him in a way. This is almost played for laughs, which could be brilliant in a way, if you could sense the underlying tragedy, but I'm not sure you get that. Instead you get these fantastical attempts at some kind of meta narrative, some grand conclusion that I don't think the film has really earned, so it falls kind of flat.<br/><br/>But I might be missing something. The film certainly gives you ideas to think about, and like I said it's very absorbing and entertaining, I'm just not sure what it all adds up to, and the more I look at it, the more I'm skeptical.<br/><br/>But ultimately this is all kind of nitpicking, and though the film both invites and deserves this sort of analysis, I don't think that you can write it off just because of these things. It's ambitious and in many ways well done, and it deserves to e seen at least once, even if it doesn't emerge as something greater than its parts (if it in fact doesn't)"
"burlesonjesse5","8","4","10","2 December 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Birdman
","Michael Keaton has been appearing in movies every since he burst onto the scene doing the fast-talking, kooky, morgue worker thing in 1982's Night Shift. Since then, he's been in mostly semi-memorable comedies, a couple of stints in two Batman films, and forgettable duds like 1998's Jack Frost, 2005's White Noise, and Herbie: Fully Loaded (oy vey). Watching 2014's Birdman made me wonder why it took so long for him to I don't know, star in anything Academy Award worthy. He's always had the ability to someday be nominated for an Oscar. Director Alejandro G. Inarritu's latest is a raw, unflinching, bracingly original play on words and for what it's worth, might just punch Keaton's thirty- two year wait of a ticket. As an acting showcase, this ""bird"" is definitely the word as quiet as it's kept.<br/><br/>Filmed primarily in and around one location (NYC's St. James Theatre), edited brilliantly by Douglas Crise (Spring Breakers) and Stephen Mirrione (George Clooney's The Monuments Men), and featuring a lot of male characters fighting/running around in their underwear, Birdman immediately hones in on a washed up actor named Riggan Thomson (Michael ""my real last name is Douglas"" Keaton). Thomson hasn't been in much of anything lately whether it be Broadway or Hollywood fodder. His one salvation: Direct, write, and star in a play adapting Raymond Carver's (a real-life, famous writer) short story, ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". As the proceedings move along, you don't get the feeling that you're gonna see many acts in said stage production (within a movie). It's more about the behind-the-scenes stuff that is conflicted with multiple actor egos, creative differences, actual fist fighting among the cast members, daughter/father resolutions, and attempted, co- star rape (very mild and only in one short scene).<br/><br/>Michael Keaton's performance, which if you haven't already heard, is the high point. It has a nasty, kick-in-the-door intensity to it. Is his Riggan Thomson on drugs? Is he a chronic alcoholic? Or schizophrenic? Does he have an imaginary friend in alter ego ""Birdman"" (his superhero character popularized in movies over two decades ago)? Finally, can he actually move objects with his brain? And can he fly (you know I'm kidding, right)? It doesn't matter. Keaton's Thomson probably possesses a lot of these things and he plays him with a visibly weathered, unassuming style. You can't quite see the wheels turning in Beetlejuice's head. That's the brilliance you get from a veteran screen icon who seems hellbent on literally acting his testicles off. The rest of the cast, well they fade in and out and still kill it at the same time. Edward Norton is despicably good as Thomson's belligerent acting rival. Emma Stone, with her gigantic, glaring eyeballs, emotes wonderfully in a couple of scenes as Keaton's character's druggie daughter. Zach Galifianakis is unexpectedly brilliant playing Thomson's hopped-up best friend/lawyer (this is quite a diversion from his Hangover doofus) and Amy Ryan, well she's a soft revelation playing I guess, Thomson's intolerant ex-wife.<br/><br/>Then there's Inarritu's knockout direction which has to be seen to be believed. He's a filmmaker who doesn't fly by the rules and gets away with things every time. Remember in 2003's 21 Grams when he filmed every scene out of order (like a bunch of puzzle pieces) only to put them neatly back together in the end? I do. This guy's out of bounds but in a good way. With Birdman (his 5th feature), he fumbles a bit with his confusing storyline only to shoot some of the most elaborate tracking shot sequences this side of Goodfellas and Boogie Nights. You drop your jaw in amazement as to how many marks the actors had to hit, how many takes their endless shots might have possessed, how many hundreds of lines of dialogue they had to memorize, and when in said shots, did Inarritu actually yell ""cut"" (it's conceivable that the first hour or so might have been one long tracking bonanza. That can't be right, can it?).<br/><br/>In retrospect, Birdman is set to a film score that is mostly fused with solo, jazz-inspired drumming. It's a fall release posing as part hallucinatory dream, part suicidal character study, and part frigid, black comedy. Watching it made me think that what's on screen might be too radical for title as best vehicle of 2014. It could however, get a shot in the category of Best Picture nods come January. Only time will tell. Anyway, as a celebratory Steadicam feast that makes you think, ""how the heck did they film that?"", Birdman is Keaton's finest hour and for my money, truly a top ""feeder"" (ha-ha)."

","I walked out of the theater with a weird feeling of ""What just happened?"" I would not say I hated it, and I would not say I loved it. If you like beautiful cinematography featuring the theater district of New York City, then you will enjoy this. If you are philosophical, artsy, and are able to ""make your own meaning"" when watching any type of movie, then this movie will be tolerable for you. My favorite part was when the daughter assistant character was telling her father that he was not relevant because he is not on facebook or twitter. She did it with such pizazz! LOL I would not have to watch this again for the rest of my life. When the movie ended, I felt a little like I did at the end of the Lost series. There were many weird things in the movie that had no explanation. The main character could move things by just magically willing them to move. We did not really figure out why exactly this was important. It leaves it up to you to make your own meaning. In Lost there was lots of these types of weird things that left you thinking, ""I wonder what meaning of that is."" So, this movie is not the norm, wild, bizarre, beautifully shot featuring the streets of NYC, and will leave you with many questions. If you get easily frustrated by movies that are too ""artsy fartsy"", then you may want to wait to watch this on Netflix or not watch it at all. Now, I am off to bed to hopefully not have too many weird dreams as a result of watching this movie."
"estebangonzalez10","9","5","14","8 February 2015"," The technical ambitions pay off for Iñarritu and Lubezki
","""You're doing this because you're scared to death, like the rest of us, that you don't matter. And you know what? You're right. You don't. It's not important. You're not important. Get used to it.""<br/><br/>No matter how people feel about this film, there is no denying that Birdman is a technical marvel. Emmanuel Lubezki is one of the best cinematographers in Hollywood and he should continue working and experimenting with his fellow Mexican directors. Birdman is visually astonishing and one of the most unforgettable movie-going experiences of the year. He blew us away last year when he took us to space in Gravity, and now he astonishes audiences once again by giving us the illusion that the film is taking place entirely in one single shot. From the opening shot, Lubezki is letting us know that we are going to get our heads spun and so he circles around a table with four actors discussing their roles in the play they are about to act in. Birdman is unlike any other film I've seen in that sense, where you feel like you are watching actors in a live theater. The audience becomes the camera which follows around these egocentric and troubled actors as they interact with one another. The film has stuck with me and it is one of those rare movies I'd like to experience once again in the theaters. I can't think of another film that manages to portray the passage of time so well without having to cut from one scene to the next the way Birdman does. <br/><br/>Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu is better known for his realistic and depressive films focusing on separate characters whose lives intertwine someway or another (Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Babel). This was quite a fantastic change of tone from his previous and more depressing films. He has crafted one of the best films of the year with groundbreaking editing effects that magically make us believe the film is all a continuous shot. He also uses dark and satirical humor to critique egocentric Hollywood actors, critics, artists, and even audiences who eat up anything they are served as long as there are loud explosions and non-stop action scenes. Iñarritu takes a shot at just about everyone. Alexander Dinelaris's script was wickedly smart and satirical with some great and memorable dialogues that complement the technical achievements of the film very well. Birdman has a lot to say about our human nature and our desperation to become relevant and important. It is a complete film that deserves all the recognition and awards it has been receiving.<br/><br/>The performances in Birdman also stand out above most films released this year. Michael Keaton is fantastic as Riggan Thomson, a once popular actor who starred in a superhero franchise but hasn't been able to do anything relevant since. He is known for the character of Birdman, but he wants to prove he is a real artist and not just a washed up celebrity. That is why he is risking everything in a play he is directing, writing, producing, and starring in. His good friend, Jake (Zach Galifianakis) is co-producing the play with him. Lesley (Naomi Watts), Laura (Andrea Riseborough), and Mike (Edward Norton) are the actors he hires for the play, while his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is working for him as his personal assistant as she tries to recover from her former drug addictions. The supporting cast is excellent in this film, especially Edward Norton and Emma Stone who share several great scenes together along with Michael Keaton. Galifianakis also impresses in a much more serious role than what we are used to seeing him in, but this is still Keaton's film who displays a wide range of emotions. Birdman has become such an important part of his life that he actually interacts with him in a surreal way. The film balances this magical realism very well and Keaton pulls off the feat of having these inner conversations with himself. The intimate camera-work only enhances these performances even more."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","14","22 January 2015"," Although Michael Keaton shines in the centre, this is a brilliant ensemble
","In ""Birdman"" very much talked about is the super-long-take, undeservedly. The suggestion that there is an intention to create the illusion (not doing the real thing, mind you) that the entire 120 minutes is shot in one single take is absolute garbage. The story takes place over a period of two or three days and in different locations (albeit in the same vicinity). To suggest that this can be reproduced by a camera with one take in real time is absurdity. To even try to create such an illusion is meaningless. To make such a suggestion is to insult the movie makers' intelligence, as well as the audience's. <br/><br/>What director Inarritu was doing was to shoot his movie in scenes of long single takes. Facilitating this approach is the almost maze like interior of a Broadway theatre, allowing the camera to meander through narrow corridors, following various actors. This technique is not unusual. The best example is the much applauded opening of ""Snake eyes"" (1998) when the camera follows a flamboyant Nicolas Cage for something like 7 or 8 minutes in one single take. A less known example is the 2005 rendition of ""Pride and Prejudice"" (starring Kiera Knightley) which deftly uses this technique to handle a grand ball scene. At the undisputed pinnacle of this feat is the documentary ""Russian Ark"" (2002) which presents a 96-minute guided tour (complete with on-the-spot dance and music performed as a grand ball scene) of the Hermitage, shot in one single take. Long one-take is a technique which just happened to have been aptly employed in ""Birdman"", marrying well with the style of the movie. However, it should not be allowed to distract from the glory of the movie which are, first and foremost, its script, dialogue and acting.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" is about many things but if I were to choose just one, it has to be the live stage and the people who are an integral part of it, both on and behind the scene. Two good examples of this loosely grouped genre are ""Mrs Henderson presents"" (2005) and ""Being Julia"" (2004). The main story line of ""Birdman"" is about an over-the-hill actor (stage and screen, both) making a last-ditch effort to matter again, by mounting a play in Broadway, as playwright, director and lead actor all rolled into one. The trailer is somewhat misleading (intentionally or otherwise, I cannot say with certainty) in overemphasizing the element of surreal. For example, the scene in which you see the protagonist Riggan (Michael Keaton) striding along Time Square with nothing except under pants amidst a throng of people has a simple and logical explanation. While taking a breathing space during somebody else's scene, the actor happens to have accidentally locked himself outside the theatre, with his robe hopelessly caught in the closed back door. He has no choice but to try to make his way to the front entrance to get back into the theatre, hopefully before his next scene. Other things like levitation and moving objects without touching are merely montages reflecting the character's lively mental status.<br/><br/>The beauty of this movie is in the delightful dialogue and superb acting. The assortment of people surrounding the protagonist and the interaction they have with him, as well as with each other, is sheer joy to watch. Emma Stone plays Sam, his daughter-cum-assistant just out of drug rehab, the youngest and ironically the most world-wearied and under a strained relationship with her father. Sam's mother Sylvia (Amy Ryan) and Riggin's ex-wife is still on good terms with father and daughter and often comes backstage to visit. Together with Riggan in the cast are three other people. Laura (Andrea Riseborough) is his current lover who for a moment thinks that she is pregnant with his child. Lesley (Naomi Watts) is a gentle, vulnerable actress quite nervous on the verge of realizing her lifelong dream of acting on Broadway. Mike (Edward Norton) is brilliance and arrogance personified, recruited at the eleventh hour to replace an incompetent actor who, if you must know, is incapacitated by an ""accident"" arranged by Riggan. Jake (Zach Galifianakis) is the level-headed manager and loyal friend always by his side to help him weather the proliferation of mishaps. Finally, there is Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan), the viciously determined critic who has sworn to ""kill his play"".<br/><br/>While the characters are not over-written, this movie never shies away from high drama and shouting scenes, delivered with top-notch performances. Throughout the two hours that seem so short, you are dazzled by the scenes generated from the permutation of interactions among this talented ensemble. There are far too many to mention. Among so many of them, two I like best. One is Norton and Stone as Mike and Sam on the roof of the theatre, two strangers tentatively exploring each other's soul through the familiar game of ""truth or dare"". The other is in the dressing room with the two actresses Leslie and Laura, played by Watts and Riseborough, comforting and encouraging each other, culminating in one passionate girl-girl kiss. There are a lot of others to be discovered in this movie that many consider to be the best in the year."

Mike is the egocentric douche bag of the film and he brings his character to life so efficiently that it is far beyond believable. Emma Stone is the other notable performance.

Thomson is trying to rebuild his career by writing, directing and starring in a play opening on Broadway. As the premiere date nears, Thomson begins to lose his grip on reality as he is agitated by critics (Lindsay Duncan), co- stars (Edward Norton, Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough) and his costumed alter ego.<br/><br/>Birdman is a twisted satire of show business set to an acid jazz drum score that's darkly comic and completely brilliant. Keaton is incredible, as are the rest of the cast with not one shabby performance (no matter how big or small the role).

","What can I say about this film... excellent would be an understatement. Having just left the theater, I am pained by the thought that more people have not and may never see Birdman. Birdman sounds cliché, the title is something we've all heard before. Superhero, superhero, superhero. This movie is not that. <br/><br/>Instead, Birdman offers a true look in to the mind of a man who has, in theory, disappeared. He has no social media, barely any family, and about as much relevance as... well, a guy who played in superhero movies years ago. But what shifts Birdman from every other movie is the true glimpse you get inside of all the characters heads. Never once do you feel like the actors are trying to hard, you forget they're acting. You forget you're in a movie. <br/><br/>Birdman constantly walks on the lines of reality and fantasy. And at the end, you are left to decide what is real or not.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone who truly enjoys movies, I mean real, authentic, just all around good movies."

"jvic52","10","3","7","26 August 2015"," I feel as though everyone misunderstood this epic
","After watching this film for about the 10th time in the matter of a few weeks I went on IMDb to read about how awesome everyone else thought this film was. I was shocked to see how many people didn't like it, and as a matter of fact many loathed it. One reviewer said he would of rather starred at a blank television screen for 2 hours than watch this film. I wasn't sure that we were talking about the same movie or not. I literally thought that this was one of the best films that I've seen in the past 5 years. Reviewers however, keep saying that it had bad acting, bad directing, bad soundtrack, and a bad plot. I hate to say it but if you honestly think that I think you missed the entire point of the movie and what it's about. <br/><br/>Bad Acting? This is one of Michael Keaton's best films he has ever been a part of. He gives the strongest performance out of the great actors that he is on screen with. The scene where he is telling off the critic from the New York Times is nothing short of amazing. It's also great to see how he slowly starts to lose grip with himself and with the world around him. Edward Norton, as always, gives a solid supporting performance... he truly shines as a narcissistic,self-absorbed,brilliant stage actor. Emma Stone gives one of her best performances as well. She is a troubled, misguided youth who never really got to know her father. And now since she is out of rehab she is thrown into her father's world of celebrity/acting chaos. It's really something to see her character develop in this movie. Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough, and Zach Galifianakis all give solid performances. These characters are the glue that hold this story together because the plot doesn't necessarily revolve around them but they are key figures in moving the story along. Without them, this movie would of certainly lost some of it's charisma. <br/><br/>Bad Directing? (Deep breath)..... Alejandro Gonzalez Inarittu deserved every single Oscar that he was given. This film won for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, and Best Writing/Original Screenplay. SO many people were on here saying ""don't believe the hype"" or ""critics in Hollywood don't know anything about movies anymore."" Do people realize that scenes in a movie last about 30 seconds to a minute as far as acting goes??? Then the director yells CUT and the scenes ends/changes. In this movie so many scenes are about 10-15 minutes long! That means that these actors are staying in character, remembering their lines, knowing where to go, all while a camera is following them or moving around them while they try not to notice it! It's one long continuous take after another with this movie. That's the beauty of it... It's almost as if it is a play but in motion picture form. <br/><br/>Bad Plot? Yes, the theme of this story has been done a few other times. No, this is not exactly how theater or cinema works. They are using the theater as a vehicle to tell the story. Even though I played high school football in my youth, I don't look at a film like Remember the Titans and think to myself.... ""this is such B.S., they wouldn't of been able to do that in football!"" We all have to look at the big picture of the movie not how ""realistic"" it is when speaking of the theater. I think for the most part this movie got a lot of things right. On top of all this as well, the film is a satire. It is supposed to exaggerate real life in a humorous way to point out others vices or flaws. This movie is steeped in so much dark comedy that numerous views have to be done in order to take it all in.<br/><br/>This movie is very important to American cinema. We are entering into a weird/crazy world of acting and movies now. I don't want to live in a world where Vin Diesel, Adam Sandler, Jackie Chan, or Dwayne Johnson are all the top grossing actors in the world. I think at the end of the day that's the great metaphor that this movie is focusing on... what do you want to be known for? Do you want to take the easy way out and settle on something that will make you money or do you want to take a chance on something and really show the world what you're capable of regardless of the rewards?? So many of the greats throughout history have been misunderstood or misinterpreted. In my opinion that's why this film is titled ""Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"", because Riggin is so hard on himself and so sure that his play is going to be marked as a failure even though it is honestly something brilliant. <br/><br/>""Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds"""

But now after reading the user comments we don't feel so bad. The hand held camera work was jarring and unsettling, the overbearing drum music (and i use the word 'music' sarcastically) was loud and out of place - I feel a two year old could have banged out the same discordant notes. The plot, if you could call it a plot, was nonsensical and drunkenly switched back and forth from comedy, to dark comedy, fantasy, and drama. The only saving grace was the fine acting turned in by Keaton and Norton whom i often wondered whether they were ad libbing many of their lines.

"chuckroddy","5","3","7","3 April 2015"," The Unexpected Virtue of Pretension
","Most movies have a basic story flow, likable or interesting characters, and a general theme or message. When a movie like Birdman breaks from this convention, it almost tries to be critic proof by wrapping itself in artiness and obfuscation. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, it also leaves half of the general audience asleep, bored, or angry, though it will struck a chord with some people. <br/><br/>Our main character is a washed up actor trying to put on a play why being haunted by his comic book movie success. 30 minutes in we meet his daughter, who spells out completely how pathetic his attempt to be relevant, covering all the bases of his character. We've now hit our climax. The rest of the movies is just him trying to get through the play and gain critical success. This is where you really start to feel the 2 hour running time, wondering if anything else is really going to happen, and if the voice in his head is real. <br/><br/>Probably the most interesting segment is when the voice in his head starts hovering behind him and becomes an actual birdman, breaking to a scene of the city being menaced by a destructive monster, complete with explosions and a commentary of super hero movies. This where the movie breaks the fourth wall and tells the audience it would rather be seeing this, rather than ""depressing philosophical sh*t."" But does putting a lamp on the problem solve the issue that we're watching a depressing, unlikable character lament his existence? We're practically watching a drunk, angry guy in a bar rant into the wind. At the end we're clued that this is all in his head. <br/><br/>No dash of pretension would be complete without a rant against critics. Our strawman is a woman who vows to give a bad review because she hates the artist, as opposed to the play being the garbage that it is. <br/><br/>We wrap up with multiple endings where at any point the character may or may not have committed suicide, leaving a ""Jacob's Ladder"" style perfect life extension. <br/><br/>Plodding through go nowhere stories and go nowhere characters can work for some people if there's more to enjoy. 2001 had cinematography, and Birdman gets by with a single-shot gimmick. Film students will love this, most people won't care. The humor will work for some, but it's style is dry and subjective. You'll laugh at the ""smells like balls"" line or you won't. Some people will love the anti-super hero movie theme, but conventional story telling exists for a reason, and for each ""Transformers"" there's also a ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" <br/><br/>This film is loaded with so many meta jokes that it no longer becomes a story. Either it's a pretentious cinematic rant by and for actors only, or it's an ironic commentary on pretentious commentaries. Or it's vague enough in its themes that it tries to have it both ways. <br/><br/>But mysterious intentions doesn't equal genius. The genius is putting everything in a closed box and have everyone project their own ideas into it. But when people who praise something all seem to be seeing something completely different, perhaps the piece is not as solid as it seems.

","This movie just drew down my whole jawline. I am absolutely mesmerized that after Dogville I could be anyhow impressed by a theatre-sort-of-adaptation with this one after so many years. Inarritu just killed it. <br/><br/>It starts so lame, just like Michael Keaton's goofy, expressionless blue eyes, but it grows up on so rapidly that one really loses the feeling when and how they got their souls and eyes really stuck on the screen. I am definitely impressed by the development of all the characters with no exclusion. This is a pure talent movie, combined by a great direction and a script that lacks absolutely no human emotion. <br/><br/>I would surely not call it a drama, it's more satire and sarcastic than painful and blue but it contains it as well - that absolute feeling of the Birdman solitude that has turned him into a flying fly around, with induced by the past feelings to continually deal with. This absolute thought of an inevitable suicidal mind that just never happens to become real and comprehended as a sin. <br/><br/>I loved it thoroughly. We don't need Birdman to believe in human superpowers. But we do because they don't really exist. Does Birdman exist at all?"

","Disclaimer: this review will mainly act as a counterargument to the criticism I have seen.<br/><br/>This movie is a blast. Extremely entertaining and funny. I loved the cinematography. The movie looks like it is one shot. They may have cut the movie during a pan shot, and I noticed some moments where the screen went almost black and you could imagine that there was a cut, but isn't that what happens on stage? <br/><br/>Michael Keaton gives an Oscar worthy performance. All the actors are great. The movie feels like it is improvised, I love it. In fact at IMDb's trivia section it says that some moments were slightly improvised.<br/><br/>A common criticism is this: the long takes were gimmicky. It did serve a function. It made it look like a stage production. And it may also act as a reflection of our celebrity-culture.<br/><br/>I have heard that this movie was boring. This point is extremely subjective, but I still can't understand how anyone can feel that way. It was fast paced, it was fun to look at, and the characters were interesting.<br/><br/>Pretentious...<br/><br/>attempting to impress by affecting greater importance or merit than is actually possessed: pretentious art films | the pretentious jargon of wine experts.<br/><br/>I'd like to mostly focus on the part where it says: attempting to impress. The movie did try to impress me, but the movie did impress me. To some degree aren't all movies trying to impress me. I feel like it is a meaningless criticism.<br/><br/>You are starting to look more and more like the archetype critic from Birdman. That doesn't disprove your point, but I do believe that this movie is more truthful than you are aware of.<br/><br/>You're all entitled to your opinion, but please present me an argument. Don't turn into the critic from Birdman. I think this quote sums it up pretty well. <br/><br/>(I had to censor some parts. IMDb won't let me post the uncensored version, even if it comes from their site. The beeps are the f-word.)<br/><br/>""Call the police... let's read. Lacklustre... That's just labels. Marginality...

","I created an account just to set the record straight on all these bad reviews. From start to finish I was completely engaged with every the characters. I found them to be humorous and at the same time realistic. The movie is not about plot points people! Its about characters and how they are all trying to find validation through this play. The idea that Keaton's character starts to blur the line between art and reality, his Birdman character and himself, is really the focus. You will see this theme throughout, like with Norton's character trying to make the play hyper- realistic (real booze, real sex, etc.) and as well with the actors roles in the play they are doing in the movie becoming what actually is occurring (on some level-for example the pregnancy with the girlfriend). The filming was genius, it felt like a play going from one room to the next room, furthering the idea that the play is their reality. The drum track really kept the momentum and Edward Norton was so funny!By far this was Michael Keaton's best performance (not Batman, lol). So don't look for a traditional storyline, its about how Keaton becomes one with Birdman, reality and fantasy becoming the same thing. Best movie of the year, hands down! I also want to add, I laughed more watching this movie than any comedy I have watched recently."

This movie is no better than feature length testicle kicks and gastrointestinal methane release. Where is the intelligence? This movie was a sad attempt at trying to make fecal look smart. Michael Keaton used to be so funny, edgy, and witty. He now looks and acts bloated, stale, and rancid. Zach still has his college slob humor work attitude forcing audiences to wonder if he really is that one dimensional. Miss Stone needs to steer clear of this mess if she wants to see her career continue to rise.

","For the full review, go to https://scribblesofstageandscreen.wordpress.com/ <br/><br/>After first viewing the trailer to Birdman or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, I was underwhelmed and slightly confused regarding the storyline. My opinion to see it wavered after viewing Margaret and David's unanimous 5 star review of it on their final episode of At the Movies. However I hadn't committed to seeing it until the recent Golden Globes, where Birdman was the subject of several nominations, wins and discussions. Although I am in no way undermining the quality of this film, there's potentially an alternative explanation behind Birdman's success at awards ceremonies. My mother's opinion is that everyone in the entertainment industry is vain and therefore loves to see a movie about themselves (particularly for those lucky few who get mentioned in the film). Although clearly not the only factor contributing to its success, there is some truth in the fact that awards judges would certainly relate to this film more than The Theory of Everything, for example. The film, (co-written, directed and produced by Alejandro G Iñárritu) depicts actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), at the lowest point of his life. He's haunted by his past glories playing comic book superhero in the famous 90's action trilogy of Birdman. Spurred by the realisation that he has achieved nothing since then, Riggan decides to write, direct, and star in a Broadway adaption of Raymond Carver's story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. The initial plot line follows the mould of many other inspirational films before it (Wild, Eat Pray Love, The Pursuit of Happiness, The Bucket List);<br/><br/>Protagonist finds oneself in a rut. Embarks on (often unrealistic) mission of self-discovery to revive their broken life. Experiences a creative array of complications preventing said protagonist from achieving goal. Protagonist discovers meaning of life/ their place in the world, in an unexpected way, often proving themselves to unsupportive others. Despite this seemingly simple plot line, Birdman's storyline feels anything but linear. Although it started with an obvious goal, and ended with a somewhat resolution, the complications in the middle got lost amongst the winding walking shots and mind-controlled tantrums. With that in mind, Iñárritu's unique directing style is not necessarily a bad thing. From the opening sequence, it's clear that Birdman is far from your average film. The Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and Editors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione have combined lengthy one-take shots, shaky hand-held camera work and snappy editing to give the effect that whole film was shot in one take. The long-shot technique has been done before in Gravity, The Player, Children of men, Russian Ark and Goodfellas. However the combination of well-timed drum solos and Scorsese-esque walking-shots-from-behind, make Birdman stand out from the crowd. There are countless complications which prevent Riggan from putting on an award winning Broadway show to revive his career. There's the terrible lead actor, the method-acting dickhead that replaces him (Edward Norton), his financial problems and his relationship with his troubled daughter (Emma Stone) and ex-wife (Amy Ryan). Most of all is his existential crisis, which culminates into numerous arguments with his ""Birdman"" self. Jo Bradley https://scribblesofstageandscreen.wordpress.com/"

","This movie was interesting as an insight to a struggling actor's life in the theater. He was this great method actor and became his character, the ""Birdman"". I could easily see how this would be considered a masterpiece to a struggling actor, director, theater performers or anyone who has dedicated their time to what they like to call ""show business"". This was obviously made for a very small demographic of viewers in mind but hit the nail on the head in regards to appealing to the ""right ones"". This was a hipster's dream, definitely did not deserve the academy recognition that it received. Would be great as a television series but as an epic academy award film?

","I don't understand the hype. In short, this movie came off very much like a play about the making of a play leading up to opening night. I found it very hard to be very sympathetic about the main character who is a ""washed up"" Hollywood celebrity who has squandered his wealth and wants to recapture his fame. Some people might find that premise interesting but I didn't. Aren't most celebrities and stage actors just serious cutthroat attention seekers who court then shun public attention anyway and blow it in the process? Not that I have anything against celebrities, but fame is temporary and that's the nature of the business. It's invasive and prone to self-destruction. <br/><br/>And mind you, I don't watch a lot of junk either so I think I'm being fair."
"PeterGaskell","8","5","15","17 January 2015"," Deserving of Oscars for director and original screenplay
","(Spoiler alerts included) Not surprisingly one of the front-running Oscar nominations, this absorbing film keeps you locked in tight as the protagonist staggers his way toward redemption, even while arousing some laughs. Refusing to perpetuate his superhero film career despite lucrative offers to extend the Birdman franchise ad infinitum, Riggan Thomson attempts to prove himself as an actor and writer on Broadway so his artistic spirit can again take to the skies. He has adapted a Raymond Carver story for the theatre which he will direct and take lead role. <br/><br/>The devil on his shoulder is the Birdman character he used to play on film, who urges him to forgo his theatre ambitions and get back into movie-acting. As Thomson struggles to assert his own identity in angry exchanges with Birdman when he is otherwise alone, he is seen behaving like the superhero character he used to play, propelling objects without touching them. So how human really is our protagonist?<br/><br/>The film has a clever narrative which keeps you guessing about this, as it explores themes of insecurity (parenthood, sexuality, career) and artistry versus celebrity. Consistent with the character Birdman who wears one, the film's motif is the mask whereby the actors are revealed to be unlike the confident persona they present to the world. You are never sure if you are watching reality or a presentation of its subject's imaginings. <br/><br/>The fear of a bad theatre preview is the menace that Thomson has to face, also his effectiveness as a lover and a father. When his daughter Sam harshly criticises his relevance in the world, Iñárritu's direction shows less a reaction from the protagonist but rather focuses the camera close up on Sam's face as her invective goes into overdrive. Like us watching, she starts to realise she is totally self-absorbed and blind to the feelings of others. This diatribe becomes the turning point on her character journey that leads her to help her father fulfil his later.<br/><br/>The plot develops so that the characters in the stage play within the film are unmasked to show them failing to deal with their problems about loving and being loved. They evoke sympathy, even the egotistical method actor who so effectively gets to grip with the play's script and brings it alive yet only comes alive himself sexually while on stage. When the female actors are confronted by their insecurities, they find sexual solace in each other. <br/><br/>Some other reviews pan 'Birdman's failure to amuse. While it is more situational than in witty dialogue, humour is plentiful enough. (spoiler here...) Thomson's unmasking includes losing his dressing gown which gets trapped in the theatre door as he steps outside for a cigarette between scenes. He has to find his way through crowded streets to the theatre front door in his underwear before appearing on stage dressed so.<br/><br/>(more spoiler..) There is a false climax where Thomson is perched above the streets of New York where you believe the film is about to end before the real climax takes place on stage. This is another example of the craft employed where you are kept on edge as the play is acted because you are never allowed to be sure if the stage-play action is going off Thomson's script. There are clues to foreshadow the climax but it is effective when it happens. Finally the tension is released as uncertainty about semblance and reality is resolved.<br/><br/>The only character not to evoke sympathy is the theatre critic determined to see the play close on Broadway. With another twist on the semblance/reality dichotomy, she only changes her posture after the shocking climax to the stage play (and the film), yet not from a change of heart or any realisation about artistry in the performance but out of a pretentious reaction to the violence she has witnessed that prompts her to coin a new theatrical genre - 'ultra-realism'.<br/><br/>While 'Birdman' is well-acted throughout, its Oscar-winning potential is for its screenplay and technical execution. The camera focus hardly ever moves more than a few feet from its subject and the jazz drum soundtrack, appearing to be played live at times, assists in keeping up the claustrophobic tension. The script is well up to developing the film's concept, its themes and characterisation. Its dialogue is fully audible too. If 'Interstellar' wins Oscars for both sound editing and sound mixing, and Iñárritu doesn't win for director and original screenplay categories for 'Birdman', I too will resort to running through Times Square in my underpants..."

Second, When Riggan is daydreaming about all kind of action sequences (for me this is Key Scene) and finally, third, at the end of the movie when Riggan's daughter is looking for him at the hospital...<br/><br/>In conclusion, it is a very good movie, with really good actors and a very complicated screenplay, BUT you have to wait...thats it!"

","From the trailer I already knew what Birdman had in store for me. And I was not surprised by the many writers of this film. It was way too complex for one writer to produce such an exceptionally well written screenplay. <br/><br/>Riggan Thomson has now become an irrelevant celebrity in entertainment who is haunted by his past - a fictional superhero character he used to portray in blockbuster movies which was disenfranchised more than 20 years ago.<br/><br/>Riggan only wants to revive his career but has to juggle between his drug addict daughter who's been in and out of rehab, his flopping career, the mother of his daughter, a acclaimed New York Time critic who is determined to bring him down, a master plan involving him successfully staging a comeback, a fictional character that torments him by relentlessly begging him to do another sequel of Birdman, and his much younger girlfriend whom he does not seem to love. The story also touches on current industry affairs which makes it even more relevant than it should be; where Riggan and his girlfriend Laura dreading parenthood because they think it would have resulted in them having an offspring like Justin Beiber. This was cute.<br/><br/>In the movie, Riggan still thinks he is Birdman (his alter ego) and hallucinates most of the time. He still thinks he has supernatural abilities to move or break objects without making physical contact with them. It would be wrong ignore the remarkable use of using one single/fluid/continuous/constant streaming/lingering shot in the movie which who make it less editable. But the shots where the screen goes dark at the bar or theater hallways those were actually the 'cuts' or 'edits' of the movie that just needed visual literacy to understand. They were nothing but a combination of extremely long takes that are seamlessly stitched together through editing trickery. Birdman will change how we look at cinema for good with this breakthrough visual style. It had complex steady cam/hand-held camera sweeping the maze-like setting and resting on pans and pauses. The shots had no joints whatsoever.<br/><br/>Michael gave a glorious performance both in the movie (as Riggan) and the character he played on stage.<br/><br/>It has been a delight to watch such a movie on the big screen. Most of the movie time does not stop as they employed the longest takes since Gravity starring Sandra Bullock. The camera work was unusual and previously unemployed by similar mainstream flicks.<br/><br/>Edward Norton was a great sidekick. He played a thespian who came in as a replacement, who was obsessed with realism over professionalism. Birdman was made to stand out and never to be too generic or too obvious. It studied the psychological profile and inside lives of it's characters. It is not a structured superhero vs villain typical movie, but about a once respected showman who wants to relive his glory days and get back the respect that used to fill his heart.<br/><br/>The drums/percussion/jazz played by the solo were deserving. They were special. The film has a deeper meaning than the eyes can explain. It draws the viewer into the lives of actors and their world. From the trailer one could easily see that it is not your typical superhero movie. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton gave a once in a lifetime, magnificent, heartbreaking, honest and sincere performance of his entire career. One that cannot be forgotten. The actors never missed any beats or paused for anybody. The dialogue was on fire, it has no defects or flaws even when it is accelerated by the actors. In reality Michael Keaton has three lives, one as the real Michael Keaton who was dumped by Hollywood, the other as Riggan Thomson who is working on a comeback in showbiz and the other as Birdman, a fictional and disenfranchised superhero who used to save human lives in blockbuster movies. <br/><br/>The most deep rooted scene was when Riggan lies to Mike (the replacement) about his father abusing him as a child. The part where he was wrestling a break down traumatic/excellent to watch.<br/><br/>I was looking for dull moments so I could blink or mind my drink but they were absent. I was mesmerized by the scale of unrelenting skill and talent used by all the actors in this film. There are speculations about the ending where some people believe that Sam witnessed his father achieve flight on the hospital ledge but others believe that she was also hallucinating or that she saw a meteor. Like the movie Enemy where Jake Gyllenhaal's wife transforms into a giant tarantula at the end.<br/><br/>I don't think Riggan died from the leap because Sam would have seen him lying on the floor. And I also do not believe that Riggan killed himself on opening night and gave us images from his afterlife solely because he wouldn't have placed his tormentor - Birdman, in the hospital bathroom to bother him again."

As an independently minded, foreign director helmed, black comedy film featuring recently sub- par actors (Keaton, Galifianakis, Watts) who were pulling out the all the stops I loved the idea at conception.<br/><br/>Then I saw the the film and was blown away from it from the first scene and sentence. Birdman is genuinely inventive on many counts. Firstly, the idea of the story progressing ""one take"" propagated by a steady cam and invisible edit points was astonishing. I have not been taken in by such inventive cinematography since Gravity, so it was no surprise that it was shot by the same DP (Director of Photography) as Gravity was; Emmanuel Lubezki. Secondly, the way that the minimalist jazz drum score drives the film forward was fantastic. I now have the soundtrack on constant repeat.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the genius casting of Michael Keaton to reference to a failing actor from a film franchise. Who else could it have been? Val Kilmer's Batman? Brendan Routh's Superman? Michael Crawford's Condorman? None of the above would have sufficed! In Summary<br/><br/>It should be noted that all these points would add up to a gimmicky if it wasn't for the story and the way that it unfolds. Riggan Thomas, Keaton, seems to have everyone against him; his daughter, his ex-wife, his new-love interest, his manager, his fellow actors and that strange hidden ""Birdman"" character push and pull him in multiple directions. It's impossible to know which way he could turn.<br/><br/>On top of all this it is genuinely funny!

","While watching ""Birdman,"" the latest from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Babel,"" ""Amores Perros,"" ""21 Grams"") I felt an admiration and respect for it that never bubbled over into emotional involvement. The acting is superb, and Inarritu chooses to film his story in what appears to be one fluid shot; there are no cuts in the film, and instead master cinematographer Emanuel Lubezki (currently the best one in the business as far as I'm concerned) sends his camera swooping around the rooms and hallways of New York's St. James Theatre, where most of the action of the film is set. So I noticed and admired the formal aspects of the film, but didn't connect with it on any meaningful level.<br/><br/>But as time has passed since I saw it, the film has lingered in my head and gathered a richness I didn't feel like it had when I first left the theatre. I'm still not sure it will be one of my favorite movies of the year, but I can say I really really liked it, and I certainly liked it much more than any of Inarritu's previous movies.<br/><br/>In ""Birdman,"" Michael Keaton gives a just-shy-of-excellent performance as a washed up actor best known for a superhero series who's trying to prove something to himself and everyone else by mounting a Broadway play. The fiction of the play blends in with the facts of life, and the seamlessness of the actual filmmaking adds to the ambiguity of the story. I've always liked Keaton, and I'm not surprised to find that he has dramatic abilities as an actor that haven't been tapped before (or at least not frequently; he did expand his range in ""Clean and Sober""). But he's still somewhat limited as an actor, and I can't help but feel that a better actor, someone like Christian Bale, say, who could lose himself so completely into a character, would have made ""Birdman"" overall a richer experience. After all, we're with Keaton's character almost non-stop for the entire film, so he has to be played not only by an actor who you want to be with for that much time (which Keaton is) but also who can keep you interested for the entire time (which Keaton does only partly successfully). The problem is, and this is a huge compliment to the casting director, the actors around Keaton are so good that they overwhelm him, and I found myself wanting to follow them rather than stay with Keaton. Particularly good are Edward Norton as a cocky actor, and Emma Stone as Keaton's surly daughter. Naomi Watts is always good, even if she's underused here as another member of the acting company, while Amy Ryan is excellent as usual in a couple of scenes as Keaton's ex-wife.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" explores some interesting themes, chiefly the need in humans to feel relevant and how social media has changed the way people go about doing that; and more specifically to the entertainment industry the dynamic between Hollywood and the legitimate stage. But neither theme is as developed as I would have liked.<br/><br/>Still, if I don't end the year thinking that ""Birdman"" is one of my favorites, I will at least probably think it's one of the most original.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"fernandoschiavi","8","2","4","15 May 2020"," 'Birdman' is not a masterpiece as cited by many, but it is an instigating, dynamic film, full of references and that makes us reflect in different ways
","Anyone who follows the career of Alejandro G. Iñárritu knows that the Mexican director deals with controversial topics, he is one of the few that invests mainly those marginalized and discriminated against by society. That was the case in Amores Brutos (2000), 21 Grams (2003) and Babel (2006). The Mexican director's films have several stories or 'arcs', where different nuclei of characters develop, whether or not they can cross, and this time he follows the same motto, but bringing innovation in the filming mode.<br/><br/>In the past, Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) was very successful playing Birdman, a superhero who has become a cultural icon. However, since he refused to star in the fourth film with the character, his career has started to decline. In search of lost fame and also recognition as an actor, he decides to direct, script and star in the adaptation of a consecrated text for Broadway. However, amid rehearsals with the cast of Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), Lesley (Naomi Watts) and Laura (Andrea Riseborough), Riggan must deal with his agent Brandon (Zach Galifianakis) and a strange voice that insists on remaining in your mind.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, 'Birdman' is the most daring work in Iñárritu's career so far. If in his previous films, most of them were worked on the editing island, true puzzles, the director's ability consists especially in innovating by filming practically everything in sequence, making the camera, sometimes faster, sometimes more calmly follow parallel plots that intertwine all the time, following not only the perspective of the protagonist Riggan Thomson, but also of all the other characters. At the same time, the viewer's gaze is guided by the director to follow the troubled relationship between the dreamy aspiring Brodway actress, Lesley with temperamental actor Mike Shiner and obviously Riggan with his lawyer, agent and best friend Brandon, with his ex-wife. , with the news of a possible pregnancy of one of the actresses in her play, with her daughter Sam (Emma Stone), besides having to deal with the problems behind the scenes of her new play and the fear of criticism, of that work that could be his triumphant return to the spotlight.<br/><br/>The director makes a collage of references in the black humor drama ranging from Godard to Hitchcock and Sokurov. It has discreet influences from The American Night (1973) and The Player (1992). The montage, as in Festim Diabólico (1948) or Arca Russa (2002), engages long sequential shots with cuts at barely noticeable key moments, simulating a film that is totally unassembled. And this showing 99% of the time the tatro and its backstage, making the camera walk through the corridors, make-up rooms, costumes, etc., that is, in a dry space, which makes the question of filming in general more difficult, well in more open planes, sometimes in close-ups and sometimes in counter-plongée - when the camera is below eye level, facing upwards. The audience is not treated here only as external observers of your story, but as a character within the screen. Technically, 'Birdman' is a visual spectacle, but it depends a lot on the fusion of what is seen on the screen and the public's prior knowledge of its main actors, especially Michael Keaton, once the star of the time for having starred in two films of the Batman. This is essential for the operation of the film. Without metalanguage there would be no Birdman.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton plays the role of his career here. The actor decides to play with his persona, building a believable man in a fantastic world. It was not enough for him to prove to everyone that he can still star in a successful production, his personal life is going from bad to worse. Riggan is explored carefully in layers - from the insecure director to the proud actor - bringing in the man who was once Bruce Wayne, three different personalities. The first of these is the man himself, an ordinary person who struggles to make his life work, trying to make his play work while he has to deal with his daughter, Sam (Emma Stone in her best performance so far), who, in turn, , has a certain involvement with drugs. The second stage is in the already mentioned performances within the performances and the genius is in the way this character dialogues with Riggan itself, reflecting, in the play, the life of the actor / director. The third, in turn, appears in the moments of loneliness of the character, Birdman appears as an aggressive manifestation of his self-respect, functioning as a hidden double-personality. Here Iñárritu inserts his touch of master, creating in us the doubt whether Birdman really exists or is it just a tired mind's imagination? Is Riggan really a superhero?<br/><br/>If Keaton is featured, the same can be said of the supporting cast. Edward Norton gains a role to match his talent. Mike is a tough guy, who doesn't care about the opinions of others, and tries to steal the show every time he appears. His scenes with Emma Stone (equally great) and his clashes with Keaton are other memorable parts of the production. Highlight also for the always excellent Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough, who experience disappointments in the personal lives of their characters and end up supporting each other.<br/><br/>Many other aspects are criticized by Iñarritu, who criticizes practically all aspects of the current film industry, such as the massive investment in superhero films, in the pride of the actors - perfectly exemplified by Edward Norton, who plays a cartoon version of himself - and, among many others, in film criticism itself. In the technical part we still have the soundtrack of Antonio Sanchez using only drums, which got more and more accelerated as the action unfolded and became more intensified on the scene. Emmanuel Lubezki's photography is fundamental to materialize Iñárritu's plans, working dynamically, changing the focus of attention on the characters at all times, also showing the dynamism behind the scenes of a theater and the pulsating life behind the curtains.<br/><br/>'Birdman' deals with the protagonist's existential dilemma, about having fame and then losing it, about having to prove yourself with each new job, forcing yourself to reinvent yourself to feel relevant again. It is the eternal search for acceptance, here by the critics and the public. It is also a matter of learning to deal with your ego, especially in the artistic world. Keaton's character, who like the viewer, does not know what is true and what is theater (or cinema). Can he levitate? Can you make objects float? Is dead? These are some of the inventive and unusual actions that the actor will take throughout the story, in this mixture of fantasy and reality that the script proposes. A sensation that sometimes mixes reality and illusion, where the desired is manifested through Birdman's voice and figure, as if he were a ghost chasing his alter ego. They are one, inseparable, and the continuous appearance is nothing more than the voice of conscience questioning their actions, day after day. And, in addition, bringing an objective portrait of that world around him. 'Birdman' is not a masterpiece as cited by many, but it is an instigating, dynamic film, full of references and that makes us reflect in different ways, which is a little scarce in recent years."
"VS132","10","2","4","10 January 2020"," ""My Play. Why? Because I'm Birdman!""
","Birdman is the pure definition of film making at its finest. I know this wasn't his first film, but as his first breakout film, Alejandro G. Iñárritu envisioned a script so witty and thought-provoking that only a true visionary like him would be behind the camera to understand. The message underlines what acting and the box office truly means to a person even if the main populist is indifferent whether blockbusters or artistic art should be the ones praised. Honestly, all of this couldn't have been possible without the phenomenal actors attached to the film with Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone being the stand out performances. Don't even get me started with the excellent editing, long-takes, cinematography and drum score that elevates the experience to an even greater one. There is a reason why this film is praised and dares others to soar above the ground like Riggan himself."

Well this movie was boring, too artsy in a Andre Butzer vs Salvador Dali way. The way you think don't I understand this kind of art or do those critics suffer from some kind of groups dynamic. The camera wasn't groundbreaking at all its just some old technique used again. Its like someone building bricks out of stone with a chisel (cool but not really chain breaking in whats possible). Its like the Band Kraftwerk has made their music with age old instruments, still nice music but nothing to talk about, nothing game changin, like James Cameron did with state of the art techniques in Titanic. The music, one of the most important parts in makin a good movie was a complete fail here. You cannnot take one annoying drum solo and put it on every scene. No Tarantino movie had been good at all if he had taken a f**in drum solo and put it on every scene. Music is a mood enhancer and not some artsy instrument to tell the world hey listen to that drum solo this movie really is artsy.

But this is not something that interests me. There were early glimpses of Birdman's super-powers and this was the hook that enabled me to nurse some hope that it would be entertaining. But this remained only hinted at during the first hour and it became clear that we were going down the path of watching a theatrical endeavor going off the rails. Ho hum!<br/><br/>I actually invested almost an hour watching this abomination hoping, just like the guy who is certain that the turnoff is going to be right past the next rise, that things were going to turn around and it would actually be watchable...... it had such promise!

","I've almost recovered from watching this but unfortunately have not yet cleansed it from my head. I also see so many other writers have made the comment that from here on, they will avoid movies the Academy serves large numbers of awards and seek out more rewarding entertainment offerings. I think perhaps they maybe right.<br/><br/>Raymond Carver's short story (and stage play) has been adapted by Mexican director Inarritu (+ others) and transferred to the screen as an endless torture session for the unsuspecting viewer. Perhaps this is a product by or for those who were educated within consumer/conformist education systems, where 'art' is made up of: Campbell's soup posters, cheap copies of Marilyn and Elvis movie reproductions and Splash and Drip works that resemble a dogs dinner that's been spilt into a well used kitty litter tray. Now and then they come up with an exiting innovation but more often they add to each others downward spiral without even realizing it. Other movie goers, critics and judges also now belong to this school...so it perpetuates itself. Some see themselves as heading to be the new 'messiah's' of the creative arts. New? sorry, it's all been done before and perhaps maybe better.<br/><br/>What ingredients seem to represent success today?...Lots of psycho angst, mixed with superhuman occultish powers - cleaver performers willing to over act on call, swear and blaspheme at every level of the story's weaker points (in a meagre attempt to add 'power'), mix in lashings of vulgar sexual taboos (not because they add anything to the story but because the film maker is no doubt getting off on it), then add somewhat pretentious camera work that leaves you lurching from one set piece to the next (can't blame the talented photographer Emmanuel Lubezki, he gives the director just what he called for). Keaton and Norton do well but their characters are too shallow to care for - is there really as much going down here as we're supposed to think? - Perhaps to those who like to analyze 'superficial' till it means 'substance', then this is a must. <br/><br/>Beautiful British born Naomi Watts also works hard in an ill defined, ultimately unsatisfying role. There is a sequence where it looks like it may begin to work. This comes during a bar scene that brings 'Birdman' face to face with a famous critic (nicely played by Duncan) Here, there's an exchange of the better variety of discourse but it all falls over with the director reducing the critic to a caricature - obviously displaying his own contempt of critics. Another wasted opportunity. <br/><br/>The music score (or lack of) is a money-saving percussive device that at first works, then becomes as tiresome as the rest of the movie. As for the end...don't even go there!. Seems when a movie can't be decently categorized they label it a 'satire' - but even good satire needs defining quality characteristics. Overall the final result is a disappointment. Then of course, you may just think it's terrific - Such is modern 'art' - Or, it could also be as the title suggests, requiring a large serve of ""ignorance""...."
"zepedrooliveira","6","2","4","7 January 2016"," Great direction, disappointing content
","Although this movie is revolutionary, introducing the concept of non stop action which, in my point view, was designed greatly by Alejandro for this, the film itself lacks depth and meaning. The characters were badly explored and the story is minimum, giving more concern to the connection between scenes which show us constantly stairs or empty corridors turning the movie a little bland.<br/><br/>However, the concept is interesting and the film presents a great soundtrack capable of pumping everyone, that turns this movie more pleasant to watch and easier to digest. The Oscar to the director was deserved but the film itself disappointed me.<br/><br/>I give a rate of 5,5/10 to this movie and if you like good soundtracks and new concepts give it a try"
"quark18","5","2","4","29 August 2015"," An Insider's Movie
","Tedious. That was my one-word review with about 20 minutes left to go in ""Birdman"" (while watching it on free HBO), when I was just waiting for it to end.<br/><br/>Then I checked reviews online to see what others thought of the ending and was surprised to find that this movie won the Best Picture Oscar this year. Oh, right. This movie is about Hollywood and Hollywood loves to celebrate itself. Critics are part of that insider's world, as shown in the movie, so they loved it, too.<br/><br/>The first shot of Riggan Thompson levitating in the air makes it clear that he blurs the line between fantasy and reality, and is continued through the film. The scene of a celebrity trashing his dressing room is given a refreshing take when we see Riggan using his ""Birdman"" powers to destroy stuff, with his ""Birdman"" inner voice accompanying him. The first jumping scene works, when Riggan imagines himself flying over the city above all us humble folk. But the ending is just mildly puzzling.<br/><br/>However, I don't care enough about the characters or the story to watch the movie again for clues I might have missed. Riggan is shown to be a jerk from the beginning, when he arranges for an accident to knock out a fellow actor from his play. If the play is his production, why can't Riggan just fire the actor openly, like a grown-up and a professional? Why should we care about Riggan? I hope he did succeed in offing himself, at the end; that would be one less self-absorbed jerk in the world.<br/><br/>Maybe that's the point. When we look behind the curtain at the world of actors and acting, we find the same tedious screw-ups we see everywhere else in life. We, the audience, should stop celebrating actors and elevating them above us. Birdman takes a dump on the toilet, too. We should also stop glamorizing them for temporarily taking us out of our own tedious lives, as they point out.<br/><br/>The ending of ""Inception"" worked because it followed a cracking good story that drew in the audience, with characters we cared about. The director respected his audience, as shown in the way he challenged us. The ambiguous ending of ""Birdman"" does not work because we just don't care enough.<br/><br/>Dazzling technique only works when it enhances the story. ""The Lord of the Rings"" managed perspective and the relative sizes of the characters in a seamless way that allowed the viewer to focus on the story. The technique in ""Birdman"" is self-congratulatory and distracts from the story, so it does not work. It screams at us, ""look how brilliant I am!"" It's the kind of film that self-important and pretentious people think they're supposed to find smart and important, because it reflects themselves.<br/><br/>There's a huge irony here. In ""Birdman"", social media could well make Riggan's play succeed with the public, even if the official, professional critics deliberately try to kill it. In real life, however, the critics loved this movie while the general public ignored it.<br/><br/>As some other audience reviewers pointed out, ""Birdman"" won a lot of Oscars this year, but will be forgotten over time. Anyone remember ""Shakespeare in Love"" or ""American Beauty""? No one talks about those films anymore, though they won a boatload of Oscars in their day. Okay, now back to my tedious life."

He is trying to revive his waning career with his first Broadway show that he wrote and directing with his friend Jake (Zach Galifianakis). His daughter Sam (Emma Stone) works as his grumpy assistant. Lesley (Naomi Watts) acts in the play. When a light falls on the lead, Lesley suggests headliner Mike Shiner (Edward Norton). Mike is a method actor who gets on Riggan's nerves.<br/><br/>The concept of long continuous scenes is interesting. It adds to the level of difficulty. It is audacious and makes the audience sit up to pay attention. Although this movie does not take place in real time. It's not 2 hours of Riggan's life. There is one amazing scene with Keaton in his underwear. There is a daring in that it is outside in the real world. It adds a higher level of energy and that scene buzzes.

Birdman is a masterpiece, an insight into the mind of a person. It perfectly shows the conflicts inside the mind of it's protagonist, Riggan Thompson. Through Birdman we see the difficult life of Riggan as he tries to achieve success, fails, tries again. His goal throughout the movie is to be recognised as an artist, to be someone more than a famous movie star, to be remembered as someone more than a guy in a bird costume. The restless days, the loaded nights, the constant struggle with people, their egos and the ego of yourself, a constant battle with his alter ego..."" Birdman"" himself, that believes he is better off as a guy in a suit., his days are brilliantly portrayed with the long takes.<br/><br/>Life doesn't give rests then why should a movie on life should....life is nothing but the way you respond to the circumstances. Riggan strives hard and stops for no one. Hence, in the process becomes isolated from his loved ones. It's only after he is done with his play, has achieved all success that he realises that the most important thing that he craved was the hug, the hug of affection from his daughter, the embrace of his friends and his family. Even though the ending is weird and people have conflicting opinions, it's either optimistic or depressed. But i believe that it doesn't matter if he dies or if he flies.What matters is that he is loved, people care about him and he cares about them. He started out as a guy envying fame, a person with no friends only workmates and ends with him embracing love. He takes off the mask towards the end, a metaphor for taking off the birdman mask.
We all have that moment where we doubt ourselves. "" Is this the right thing for me""..."" Is what i am doing enough?"" ....Iñárritu through his world of magical realism gives us all hope and reminds us that most important thing is to do what you love, don't be a part of the horde and cherish the love you get.<br/><br/>Birdman(2014) by Alejandro González Iñárritu"

","I have always knew Alejandro González Iñárritu had it in him ever since Babel, and it goes to prove himself with seminar masterful works such as The Revenant and this masterpiece. The camerawork and cinematography is worked in a way that is to show the entire film was recorded in one take. This technical achievement is inspired straight out of the Hitchcockian technique in Rope (1948). Iñárritu has a good reason for using the one-take technique; the entire picture surrounds the protagonist and documents his every move and events transitioning one after another. In each those uninterrupted sequences we get to follow our protagonist layer after layer as a gradual continuous unraveling of his quest and yearning for art.<br/><br/>The film is about man's desire for meaning and art. Our protagonist has before starred in a popular superhero character and his fame and career has only been popular because of that role. Now he wants to mature into a serious actor and take on a play on Broadway. But this proves a challenge because the superficiality of his past superhero role is the only thing that seems to excite his audience and make him relevant.<br/><br/>One of the scenes that expresses the baggage he carries for his superhero role is when Tabitha the critic insulted him and says he does not cut out to be attempt at serious and mature and real art because of ""people like him"" who only a spectacle in pop culture, and that the fact that someone with a superficial background like that to take on Broadway is ludicrous to her.<br/><br/>But finally the film gave a revelation to our protagonist when he did nail his Broadway role which gave astute recognition from his peers. Hence, the critic referred to him as ""the unexpected virtue of ignorance"", that someone who played a superhero role could unexpectedly pull off a grand performance in theater with nothing but realism. The third act of the film leaves a lot to be interpreted, but this is one of the few amazing philosophical and profound films that was fresh and original and did not need to be adapted from another material."

","I've read a number of reviews, and am aware that this film won many awards. I have to admit, this is really different from most films out there, with a sombre theme, regarding the terrible state of affairs for actors in Broadway. People who want to make it big but realise it is very different from what they imagined but they are stuck in too deep to extricate themselves, those who have overwhelming egos and seek to destroy everyone but themselves, the very common theme of substance abuse and some other marriage or personality flaws etc.<br/><br/>The execution and presentation was interesting, with the normal band music or OSTs replaced by drumming and there being little real music, so we can actually hear what the actors and actresses say in their entirety.<br/><br/>The issue I have instead is with the story itself, and the addition of many unrelated scenes, which seem to point to somewhere else. For example, right at the beginning, a few scenes hinted that this would be a superhero film, with Riggan Thomson wielding certain powers. Which made things confusing here and there. Yes, like art it is supposed to be abstract, and many scenes seem to suggest something, then later some scenes depict something else. This sort of directing and redirecting certain focus here and there is what makes this film unique, yet when one really reflects on it, I guess I don't really know what I have been watching. More importantly, which scenes are real, and which are not?<br/><br/>To keep it simple and spoiler-free, all I will say is it's a make-or-break basically, looking at the reviews I see either very low scores or very high scores.

","Birdman is an overall solid movie. To begin with, stellar performances from Michael Keaton, Edward Norton (in my opinion, the top performance of the film), Emma Stone, Naomi Watts and Zach Galifianakis, above others.<br/><br/>Alejandro Iñarritu has shown his voluminous set of skills throughout his whole career, but to my eyes, there is no better ""One-Shot film"" attempt than this one. It is known that only 16 cuts where needed for this seamless picture to look the way it does. His direction style is very original, using fast camera movement to create blurred motion, and other unusual techniques these days. This one-shot film has a motive, it was done to enhance what an experience at a theatre would be like. That, combined to the originality and forwardness in the script, prove Iñarritu as one of the most talented directors of the century (so far).<br/><br/>Lets continue with the acting. Michael Keaton earns his single oscar nomination of his career with the portrayal of Riggan Thompson, and the interventions of his alter ego, Birdman. I think he did a great job exposing true and relatable emotions. He was very dynamic and managed a decent relation with the minor fantastic aspects throughout the plot. Edward Norton does an utterly fine performance, even though, his character, Mike, has a similar personality to Norton's natural one. Emma Stone proves his talent once again, she plays the rehab-depressed daughter of Riggan, and she does it well. Though for me, she really clicks with her ""Truth or Dare"" relationship with Mike. Other minor characters are worth a mention as well, it is known that Galifianakis suffered the shortest amounts of flubs throughout shooting. Naomi Watts has always shown a bright side when working for Alejandro.<br/><br/>The use of color is fantastic. Cinematography has an extended variety of color use, not scrict at all and does magnificent shifts between contrasting tones such as neon reds and blues. Staging (on theatre) looked great, and the inside of the St. James was handled in a far creative manner. I think Cinematography is a very solid cornerstone for this film.<br/><br/>Music is marvelous, those jazzy drum beats along all the film set a very vibrant atmosphere for the story, and switches naturally to more laidback rythims when needed. Editing was nearly needed, it lasted only two weeks. Anyways, that is in gratitude of the magnificent job done by the camera crew and the actors.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Iñarritu surely deserves the awards earned for presenting us such a real and energetic experience. Of course, his starring actors get a huge part of the job done. With sublime direction and pacing, the story escalates and goes downhill in the most authentic of ways. I'm definitively looking forward on Alejandro's next picture.<br/><br/>10/10."

","Let's begin with the elephant in the room, the single take. I feel the use of a one take in Birdman is to make appear as a play, and to display the looming calamity of Riggan's position, Making everything feel liken a boiling kettle, unconsciously searing in the back of the viewers brain. The way one takes are done in this film is something to behold, it is very hard to capture emotion during scenes in a single take, due to the use of close ups mediums and portraits to convey certain emotions, a technique that becomes very apparent in dialogue, the creative lengths this film goes to in order to create compelling dialogue scenes are brilliant.<br/><br/>Now that is out of the way, lets address materialism and the state of cinema as we know it, the play Riggan has constructed in the film becomes quite clearly diluted by his reign as a superhero, but the superhero theme is not the representation of cinema, audacity and pretension is, the hubris of Riggan becomes apparent when his supposed super powers are introduced, Riggan's powers are not illusions within his head, or actual, they are allegorical, which makes the ending tenacious to attempt understand.<br/><br/>Only minor spoilers are displayed here so I will not get into what I believe happened, and seeing as there are so many theories, I will not shove my beliefs in your face, because I feel the film is up for interpretation, but at the end of the day it would almost be more compelling if it simply meant nothing."

Adding insult to injury, It's safe to say that Iñárritu went too far with this surrealist denouement. Plus, the film is really overlong. Actually, I think the entire last thirty minutes should have been dealt with the same way Riggan has dealt with his nose. Besides, there must be a boring scene every now and then that is also somewhat pointless. I believe this is a result of the overstuffed nature of the plot.

We are supposed to watch a film with immersion and smooth scene transition. However, the story progresses like a play with one drama after another.

","The seamless editing that gives the impression that the film was shot on a single camera in one long take brings a dreamlike quality to the film. If you go back and analyse it, it doesn't seem like it should work or fit together, but at the time you are so caught up in the little world inhabited by Michael Keaton's Riggin that it seems to flow. In some ways this mirrors the loss of distinction between reality and fantasy which the film explores in Riggin, an actor who formally starred as the titular superhero 'Birdman' in Hollywood movies, now trying to remake himself on Broadway.<br/><br/>The film is disturbing in its exposure of the shallow, broken lives and fragile egos of Riggin's cast. Edward Norton's performance is noteworthy, but also unsettling.<br/><br/>The film feels weakest in the moments which suggest that Riggin may himself possess superpowers - in a way this makes the whole film seem a lot less real and perhaps it would have been stronger without these scenes."

","Actually, I WAS vaguely aware of the fact Farrah Fawcett died the same day as Michael Jackson - if not aware the same day, then certainly the same week: I also recall actor David Carradine dying at around the same time. Did you know that renowned English author Aldous Huxley died on the same day as John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas? Reading ""Love, Poverty and War"", a compendium of articles by an Anglo-American journalist, just recently, and with this very review in my mind, I learnt that C.S. Lewis died on this exact same day in 1963 as well. Eerie.<br/><br/>Such historical items of interest are at the core of ""Birdman"" - a delicious 2014 film by Mexican director Alejandro Iñárritu which is about what we consider to be worthwhile, with a particular emphasis on the world of art and culture. Nearer the end of the film, the lead of the piece, Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), points out the Fawcett/Jackson coincidence, but bleakly noted that it was Jackson who got most of the publicity - as if Fawcett didn't matter. Within the universe of the film, Riggan only recently came through a plane-set emergency which happened to have George Clooney on board too - had it crashed, Riggan theorises that his own demise would have been swept under the rug for full coverage of Clooney's, and that terrifies him...<br/><br/>Trying to capture in a few words precisely how it feels to watch ""Birdman"" is difficult - the best I can do is that it is a little like ""The Player"" meets ""Inland Empire""; its technical and aesthetical triumphs are to be marvelled at, but the film is so much more than a mere exercise in style - it has an interesting and intelligent hypothesis; it is attempting to say something; its characterisation is crisp and engaging. Having watched it twice in a week, I still came away feeling like I could see it a hundred more times and not pick up on absolutely everything: the significance of the red and blue lighting which interchangeably illuminate various scenes; whether there is any evidence either way to suggest various dream/telekinetic sequences are really happening; why seemingly random compositions of comets soaring through our atmosphere are important...<br/><br/>In a ramshackle theatre somewhere in New York City, Riggan Thomson (pronounced 'ray-gun') is directing and performing in an adaptation of an old play by Raymond Carver. He is consumed by doubt over its worthwhileness; staring monetary troubles square in the face and slowly being consumed by a developing schizophrenia. Years earlier, he was a fictitious superhero named Birdman for three films and grossed millions - now wracked by guilt for making money off the back of cheap entertainment, he attempts to pour his efforts into something more artistic. A scattered soul, he confuses the names of backstage staff he's been seeing for weeks; openly admits to his disgust for contemporary culture ('bad parents raise Justin Bieber'); does his best to keep his rebellious daughter Sam (Emma Stone) in check and must learn to work with a new actor played by Edward Norton, who carries with him his own challenges.<br/><br/>Embedded at the core of Riggan's existence is the irony that he will, in actual fact, ALWAYS be remembered within the confines of audio-visual culture anyway: as the man who played a superhero in a set of films everybody enjoyed. And yet, he is desperate to go down as somebody who did something else. Mirroring the film in a particularly uncanny way, so much so that one can never shake the sensation for the duration of the movie, is the fact Keaton himself played Batman in two films before largely disappearing from major the mainstream cinematic canon, only to now pop up in work like this for Iñárritu.<br/><br/>The film uses the confines of Riggan's mind to play out the war between high and low culture; of style vs. substance - the internal dialogue Riggan's increasingly antsy alter-ego forces him to have with himself provides us with the essay Iñárritu is attempting to convey in oral form. The argument is not delivered subtly, but with a series of jabs scattered throughout - the first of which occurs in the very first scene wherein Riggan is reminded that a large pay-cheque might have been his if only he'd opted to star in a crappy reality TV show rather than spend thousands on a play for a smaller audience. At its most aggressive, the film resorts to depicting an imaginary scenario straight out of a blockbuster whereby a huge alien bird attempts to destroy the city - a sequence so jarring, it reminds us that what we have seen to this point has appeared to be one unbroken take.<br/><br/>The internal war Riggan has with himself is, of course, a battle spilling out into the rest of the world: 'fame' now consists of going viral on the Internet; the 'worst' films make the most money; reading or attending the theatre are niche pursuits and nobody over the age of 17 seems to like any of the music we have nowadays. Lindsay Duncan's character, a merciless critic who hates modern films even more than Riggan, is afforded the duty to outline this with the best line in the film. ""Birdman"" seems to allow Sam to be the embodiment of this brave new epoch: she is pessimistic; smokes weed and wonders what on Earth possessed her father to pour all this energy into adapting Carver anyway - their confrontation is inevitable, and Riggan has no real answer to any of her points, inferring that resistance is futile.<br/><br/>What conclusions doe the film reach? ""Birdman"" opens with a quotation that to feel 'beloved on Earth' is to fulfil a good life - there is nothing in there about the quality of your output, while the film's subtitle even seems to conclude that ignorance is a virtue, albeit and unexpected one. I guess raising Justin Bieber makes you a good parent after all..."

","Part backstage drama and part study of an actor having a nervous breakdown, (plus that awful alternative title in parentheses) you might be tempted to give this particular film a miss. Incredibly, there actually are super-hero sequences too in a movie which swings between imagination and reality, fantasy and the mundane at will, taking the viewer along with it in its wake. This latter is accomplished by the acting skills of the cast and in particular the free flowing directorial style with continuous camera work tracking the action wherever it goes, imperceptibly speeding up timelines and giving a fly-on-the-wall insight into the tawdry lives of a group of actors trying to break a play on Broadway.<br/><br/>Central to it all is Michael Keaton, cunningly cast as an ex-movie star typecast from blockbuster movies he starred in twenty five years before as the super-hero Birdman, now trying to establish himself as a serious actor by adapting a Ray Carver short story into a play. Actually, said play looks absolutely awful but putting that to one side it's all about the characters' interaction, including his smart-aleck daughter who Keaton employs as his gopher, a maverick big-name big-headed actor who he recruits to boost the play's prospects, his plate-spinning manager desperate for the show to succeed as well as his former super-powered alter ego who makes Harvey-like appearances and utterances urging him to jettison the present.<br/><br/>I liked the way off-beat humour kept puncturing the so-serious conversation pieces which elsewhere take up so much of the screen time, such as both Keaton and Edward Norton as superstar thespian Mike Shiner at different times caught in scenes unashamedly donning only their tighty-whiteys, Norton's character becoming aroused in a live bedroom scene and Keaton's final breakdown when he regresses completely into his super hero guise.<br/><br/>The long-takes and relentlessly mobile camera work is wonderfully inventive and even though there is a sense that there's not really much of a story to tell here and occasionally style overtakes content. Keaton as Riggen Thompson plays the falling apart lead trying to pull himself and his play together. He demonstrates considerable range but like most of the parts here it is flashily written and screaming out for official recognition, which it duly got at the Oscars and more.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film and loved the depiction of New York's Broadway, especially as I've just returned from a first time visit to that very part of the Big Apple. I still have my suspicions as to whether the film will age well and really stands up in terms of content but no doubt actors and directors, budding and established will get a real kick out of it. Not being either, maybe I thought I occasionally saw instead the wires, smoke and mirrors propping it up."

","A hard movie to describe.<br/><br/>A very hard movie to describe and review. I have always been big on the 1989 Batman movie so this sort of feels related to that, because Michael Keaton was in both. Also, I love the way this film attacks those mindless action block busters Hollywood makes these days.<br/><br/>But there is so much more to it than what is said above. Those who describe it as another version of Hitchcock's Rope are really missing the point.<br/><br/>Birdman is a movie I wish to re-visit every few months, and that does not happen much with me and 21st century movies...I can't even decide what genre I should define it with. Basically, this makes you feel like you are behind-the scenes of a Broadway show, you will love all the characters, you will love the script, and after a few viewings you will even love the ending. <br/><br/>Outstanding!"
"Prismark10","8","0","0","28 January 2018"," The play is the thing
","Alejandro González Iñárritu has made a wonderful technical film in Birdman with the way the set has been constructed and the movement of the camera to make it look like one long shot. It is also a deceptive film as a second viewing gives you more clues apart from the obvious Chekhov's gun principle.<br/><br/>I do wonder if Iñárritu had already signed up Michael Keaton before the script was written or completed. It was well known that before Birdman Keaton was doing inferior films such as Penthouse North and heading television movie land. Although having watched Batman Forever, no reasonable person can fault him for turning it down.<br/><br/>In Birdman Keaton plays Riggan, who once made it big as squawking superhero Birdman, years before the current superhero craze. Since then he has been washed up. He tells his daughter a story of being on a plane where he sat a few seats from George Clooney, the plane encountered some trouble and Riggan realises at this point that if the plane crashed, it would be Clooney's face plastered on the papers. The irony being that Clooney was the second actor after Keaton to play Batman and a few years later Keaton was playing a small role in a George Clooney thriller.<br/><br/>Riggan is directing, adapting and starring in a play in Broadway to reclaim his career. His recovering drug addict daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is assisting, girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough) is a co-star. When the main actor gets injured at rehearsal, it is suggested by another actress Lesley (Naomi Watts) to bring in celebrated but difficult stage actor Mike (Edward Norton.)<br/><br/>Straight off the bat Riggan realises just how good Mike is, how the play comes alive when he speaks the dialogue, yet also what a nuisance he can be, throwing tantrums. Mike only feels real on the stage, this includes being sexually functional.<br/><br/>Riggan needs to get the play working by opening night and impress the theatre critic of the New York Times and she is sharpening the knives for Riggan. A celebrity (she refuses to acknowledge him as an actor) like him does not belong in polluting the New York stage.<br/><br/>Of course Birdman is more than just Riggan getting a play ready. In his quest to be relevant, he hears voices of his alter ego, Birdman. We see Riggan moving things by just thinking about it, is he on the edge of sanity or somewhere between life and death?<br/><br/>The film demonstrates how good Keaton could be, it is an astonishingly good performance from an actor known for light comedies back in the 1980s. It is a film with good performances. Norton like Sean Penn shows how effortless he can do comedy even while being intense. The real plus about the film is how you can interpret the film. It is a satire on Hollywood fame (with all its cultural references it will also age quickly) but also a reflective film about life and death."

I was also very impressed by Zach Galifianakis whom I already love as a comedian but who managed to take a more serious approach with his part in this movie.<br/><br/>I sure recommend people to watch it, if for actors only.

","'Birdman' is an interesting film, but also a movie about a Broadway play - not the most invigorating subject. The concept of a former Comic Book Movie Star trying to re-start his acting career on Broadway is certainly unique, and the film has a great look - especially the way it's filmed to look almost as if it's one continuous shot. There's a few laughs, but this is definitely not a comedy.<br/><br/>Keaton (Riggan) is great and ably supported by Stone (Sam, his daughter), Norton (Mike - happy to get around in underpants or his birthday suit for most of his scenes) & Watts (Lesley, his co-stars), although Galifianakis is a little wasted. Even though the cinematography is good, the fact it's basically one shot means there's a fair bit of wasted time as we follow characters down hallways. Probably could've been a 100min film, rather than two hours. The other thing I found annoying was the drum/cymbal fills - they're in his mind, but are very distracting.<br/><br/>It's essentially about ego and the driving force behind actors. Sure, Riggan is a more delusional character than most actors (hopefully!), driven by his insecurity. As the critic says to him: ""you're not an actor - you're a celebrity"". Burn. The ending is, like the whole film, different, but not completely satisfying."
"CinematicInceptions","8","0","0","8 October 2017"," Good picture, not best picture
","This is another movie that supports the argument that Hollywood loves movies about itself. I don't like to think that this myth is true, but 2014 was an amazing year for movies and Birdman was not the best one that came out. It's definitely good in a lot of ways and is much different from the rest of Alejandro Inarritu's work. <br/><br/>I wasn't thrilled with it as a whole piece. It was cohesive and everything, but there wasn't a whole lot of cause and effect going on. That may be a little nit-picky, but I think if you went scene by scene and asked ""why does this scene have to happen now?"" there would be a few scenes that you wouldn't be able to give a substantial answer for. On the other hand, I enjoyed watching it for a lot of reasons. It was genuinely funny at several points. The chaotic drums in the background added a lot too. The dialogue was subtly impressive, advancing each scene while sounding very natural. It certainly helped that there were a lot of great actors to play each part. Riggan was an interesting and strangely accessible character that is struggling a lot with his self-confidence.<br/><br/>The choice to make almost the entire movie a continuous tracking shot was good in some ways, and detracted in others. Part of the issue was that cut away a few times. Cutting away was good in that it drew attention to what went on in those couple moments, but it tarnished the novelty of the one-take. In a way, the movie was enhanced by the continuous shot because it reflected the world and made it feel a little more real at times. There were a few points, particularly during transitional moments like when it flashed from night to morning, where I felt like they were forcing the continuous take. This also made it a little more irksome when the take was broken. Maybe it's fitting that this particular movie was trying a little too hard to be something that it's not.<br/><br/>As I implied at the beginning, I don't think this deserved to win best picture and don't consider it a must-see. It is an artsy but good movie that can be enjoyed by people who aren't into the performing arts. Still, those who are inclined toward creative pursuits will probably enjoy this more than those who don't, or will at least have stronger opinions about it. Overall Rating: 7.9/10"

"Michael_Elliott","Null","5","16","18 January 2015"," Keaton Delivers One for the Ages
","Birdman (2014) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Michael Keaton delivers the greatest performance of his career as a washed up actor trying to get his life and career back on track by staging a play, which he wrote, directs and stars in. The only problem is that he's battling a crazed actor (Edward Norton), his just-out-of-rehab daughter (Emma Stone) and various other dramas. Through all of this, perhaps in his mind, the superhero character he's best known for, Birdman, keeps trying to tell him the comeback isn't on the stage.<br/><br/>Director Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu has created one of the most original and brilliantly witty satires of actors, Hollywood and Broadway. There's no doubt about it but the director has really created a behind-the-scenes look at a struggling actor but not only given us a glimpse into his career but also all the added drama that comes with trying to do something that you should probably fail at. BIRDMAN is a film unlike anything else I've ever seen and that's something rather hard to do in today's day and age. The film not only tells the story of this struggling actor but it then bitterly asks about what's more important. Wealth? Fame? Should an actor have dignity and go for the art film and respect? The movie drops a lot of names throughout and it's look at these subjects makes one think of ALL ABOUT EVE and Robert Altman's THE PLAYER.<br/><br/>There are so many wonderful things here but we can start on the technical side of things. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is some of the greatest you're ever going to see and it's so spectacular that this ""small"" film just needs to be seen on a giant screen. To say the cinematography is a masterpiece isn't an overstatement because it's just amazing to see how it's constantly moving, gracefully floating from one situation to the next and only standing still whenever it makes us enter the souls of the people we're watching. Everything from the lighting to the placements are downright flawless and it really creates an atmosphere like no other film. The drum score by Antonio Sanchez is another masterpiece as it perfectly pulls us into this world.<br/><br/>Then, of course, there are the performances, which rank as some of the best you're going to see this year. Stone is simply wonderful in the role of the daughter who just never had her dad around enough. There's a scene where she loses it on her father and the perfection in the performance can't be missed. Norton also delivers one of his greatest performance as the ""serious"" actor who can't stand or control the real world.<br/><br/>Both Naomi Watts and Zach Galifianakis are also excellent. The real highlight is without Keaton who has to play comedy, wit, satire, drama, tragedy and a maniac depression.<br/><br/>Sometimes all of these emotions are needed within one short sequence and to see Keaton pull it off is just some truly inspirational. Keaton has always been an underrated actor but he delivers a performance for the ages here.<br/><br/>BIRDMAN goes through a wide range of emotions but there's no denying the director's brilliance in holding it all together. This film could have gone off the rails on so many levels but when you step back and think about it, how it's all held together just gives you some added faith in creative minds out there today."

Birdman, however, is focusing on persons involved dramatic art, their goals and issues, robed into Iñárritu's round-the-bend approach. Although I had some giggles and the performances of all more-or-less leading actors were pleasing to watch (particularly Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson / Birdman, Edward Norton as Mike Shiner, Zach Galifianakis as Jake), I often felt that not all scenes and lines reached my mind, that I apparently missed inside jokes and stuff familiar to people daily involved in acting and play production (therefore, it is logical that The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has awarded 9 Academy Award nominations to Birdman this year). Thanks to skillful directing and camera-work, I did not get blah feelings, and quite a witty ending arrived earlier than expected, but still...<br/><br/>My two close relatives have worked in different theaters, I know some actors personally, been to back stages, etc., and yet, Birdman remained out-of-the-way to me. I can't image how people with no or casual contacts with theater world could watch and enjoy Birdman's storyline at all.

","Birdman has many fascinating themes and an up and close personal perspective of the drama behind the scenes world of live theatre. The tribulations of an aging movie star attempt to a comeback. The complexity of the modern family dynamics. Michael Keaton stars as Riggan Thomson who has put all he has on the line to bring a play production onto Broadway. The cinematography is good and I love the continuous camera shot scenes. Keaton creates a believable role as it were to seem to imitate life as Keaton was a past super hero in Batman. Riggan is a tormented man who fights with his internal demons. An impressive cast with Edward Norton, Zach Galinfianakis and Amy Ryan to name a few. This movie is bold, has depth, and fun to watch, perfect for theatre goers or those that like to watch a train wreck up close and personal."

","I have no doubt this film will be dissected and studied in film classes for generations to come. Why? Put simply, it reset the bar for ""masterpiece"". It is at once bold and surreal, funny and deeply moving, grounding and satirical, and most of all poignant and provoking. The cinematography was certainly off-beat, but brilliantly so, as it left me entranced upon the actors as they flew around the dingy corners of the narrow (and at times soaring) avenues. Michael Keaton easily stole ""the show"", and delivered quite possibly the most versatile and breathtaking performance I have seen from an actor in my life time. Nay, I kid you not. And Edward Norton and Naomi Watts both rose far above the challenge shown in previous roles, to say nothing of Emma Stone's bringing of the heat, which was turned up considerably more than in her typical ""geeky girl next door"" roles. Zach Galifianikis, while very svelte, seemed slightly uncomfortable among the rest of the cast, yet still managed to bring more sophistication and class than previously shown. The writing was brilliant. The execution of the narrative was impeccable. This movie deserves to be in every theater, but sadly, it isn't. So, if you want to be taken on a roller-coaster of laughs, deep emotion, and mild insanity, you'll need to get to your local art house or movie tavern to experience this journey. The journey of Birdman."
"goc6283","10","4","12","3 November 2014"," A mesmerizing, but bizarre film backed up by outstanding performances by Keaton and Norton
","The first thing to note, for those who do not know is that the film looks as if it was done in 1 take. Big ""revelation"" aside: I came into this movie knowing just about nothing outside of what is listed above, the odd preview, and the fact that I knew I would enjoy the score. I also knew I enjoy the actors in previous films and I knew I previously didn't like the director in Babel. I came out thinking this is my favorite film of the year so far.<br/><br/>Keaton plays Riggan, an actor who is most famous for writing, well, Birdman. He is shown to be rather psychotic, having an altered personality, shown through almost dream-like sequences with him arguing with his creation known as Birdman which results in among other things broken glass. Through him dealing with these sequences, he is trying to make a play while dealing with his self-conscious, the other actors (especially Shiner, aka Norton,) his mentor, his relationship with his daughter, and the ""insatiable"" movie critic (had to poke fun there, sorry.) Norton is outstanding as well, portraying his relationships as well as his view of his own life compared to what he can act as. He steals the show in the majority of scenes, especially in the roof-top scenes and the play scenes at the table.<br/><br/>The other actors/actresses serve their parts outstandingly as well. The critic is as pessimistic as she should be and his daughter shows the angst and uncontrollable emotions of someone her age. The new actress shows her doubt but how she enjoys what she wants to mean to do.<br/><br/>The film is backed up with an outstanding realized drum-solo score that keeps up with the brisk-unrelenting pace. You feel as tired as the actors but also in awe. Jokes are occasionally said but they work just to calm down the emotions of you and the characters. It builds and builds.<br/><br/>Nominations for sound editing and cinematography are potentially a shoe-in for this movie. Everything just works together, thanks to the powerful direction as well.<br/><br/>9.6/10"
"Matt-144-792009","9","4","12","27 October 2014"," Birdman is a Modern Day Sunset Boulevard.
","In Birdman (2014) Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thompson, an actor with a career path not unlike his own. Riggan was once Birdman, a Batman-esq blockbuster comic franchise. Only now Riggan is in the twilight of his career and is attempting to make it back to relevance with a Broadway play. One that he funded, directed, adapted and stars in. Riggan's play cast consists of Mike played by Edward Norton, his girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough) and Leslie (Naomi Watts). Waiting in the wings to help support Riggan in his production are his assistant Jake played by Zach Galifianakis and his fresh from rehab daughter Sam, played By Emma Stone.<br/><br/>We join the cast a few days outside of opening night during preview shows. The play seems doomed to fail from all kinds of casting, financial and critical pitfalls. Although the problems of the production all pale in comparison to its biggest issue, Riggan is a total delusional schizophrenic. All of the delusions play out first hand so we can see his madness in all its explosive glory. Riggan Thompson is a modern day Gloria Desmond in Sunset Boulevard, looking for his grand return to the silver screen and his last big close up.<br/><br/>I must admit I had mixed feeling about director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. I loved his early work in Amores Perros (2000). It was exhaustingly dramatic but the visual style and direction were powerful. Then with 21 Grams (2003), Babel (2006) and Biutiful (2010) I had decided that while a very effective and visually stunning director, his work was all way too dark for me. Maybe the artistic and symbolic message was lost on me. Overall I just couldn't help but feeling that he was a film canister is half empty type of director. Too dark and tragic to be entertaining, or enjoyable.<br/><br/>Birdman is a wonderful departure from his previous films. Birdman is just as dark, yet there is a small silver lining of bitter sweet dark comedy to make it unforgettable. Alejandro has said in interviews that his films are an extension of himself. I can't help but wonder if this new found levity to his subjects means he has found happiness. The cinematography and direction in Birdman are unlike anything I have seen. The camera weaves in out and around the theater, with long, mind blowing steady cam shots and seamless time progression shots. The Broadway set is like a more elaborate version of Wes Anderson's diorama style sets. It is as much a character in the story as an of the actors.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton delivers an Oscar worthy performance. Playing the tormented actor haunted by the inner voice of his Birdman big screen persona. The voice taking on the Christian Bale style deep, heavy smoker Batman. There are moments of madness and tenderness in Keaton's performance that rival any of his other roles. Edward Norton, as if it needs to be said, is phenomenal. Delivering sharp, rapid fire dialogue with laser point accurate timing and precision. Emma Stone as the daughter is a stand out supporting performance. Her role is a dark departure from the wide eyed cutesy teen characters she has played in the past. Zach Galifinakis as Riggan's assistant is deeper than his usual comic relief role, yet no less funny. The performances have such impact, the dialogue alone could play out amazingly as a radio drama; even without all of the pop and magic of the cinematography.<br/><br/>Birdman's message is about what being a global celebrity can do to an actor. Specifically what happens to those who have fallen out of the lime light. With critics and social media there is now no end to the level of torture a person struggling for acceptance can be subjected to.<br/><br/>In the dressing room Michael Keaton's character Riggan has a quote on his mirror ""A thing is still a thing, no mater what people say about it"". At the end of this film I couldn't help but think of the late Robyn Williams. A man brilliant in his work, loved by millions and yet tortured by inner demons, that eventually resulted in his demise.<br/><br/>This film is a testament to all of the great talent we have lost one way or another, burned up under the harsh magnifying glass of their own stardom."

","I absolutely loved this film. It's very unique, creative and downright insane. Basically, it's an independent showbiz dramedy with social satire and some blockbuster elements.<br/><br/>It's uniquely shot. The film is mostly done in one continuous shot, though there are some transitions throughout the film, and it's quite impressive how it was done. It also has very neat visuals.For instance, we have this small indie film made on a small budget and it's very impressive how the blockbuster aspect was done.<br/><br/>The story is original. We have this actor famous for playing a superhero in a movie franchise and is performing in this play. It also has the feel of a superhero film in that the protagonist can move stuff around and has these visions where his environment is like a superhero flick. It also plays out like the real world as it references recent Blockbuster films.<br/><br/>The acting is great. It has brilliant performances from Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone. During the parts where the characters are performing in a play, the actors and actresses make it very believable.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a very impressive film and I think it deserved that best picture Oscar. There is not a single thing that I did not like about this film.<br/><br/>If you expect a superhero flick, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you are interested in film and/or just want something different from the usual Hollywood stuff, it would not be a bad idea giving ""Birdman"" a watch. I highly recommend it."
"siderite","9","3","8","19 April 2015"," Why don't I have any self respect? You're an actor, honey!
","This was a full film. It had the story, the characters, the little nods and subtle hints throughout the experience and also a level of self-reference and breaking the fourth wall. Also great acting and cinematography. People really loved making this movie and it shows.<br/><br/>I won't talk about the subject much, as it has been talked to death. It's about actors, plain and simple. Michael Keaton plays really well a washed out actor who used to act as a superhero in a famous movie. He steals the show, so to speak, yet I didn't feel the story was about him, but about actors in general, perhaps all people, as actors are caricatures of real men and women. For me the scene that defined the film was the one where Naomi Watts' character goes back to her dressing room, humiliated by her actor boyfriend on stage. When she was a little kid, she wanted to be an actress. And now, that she was playing on Broadway, she still felt like a little kid.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is just a gimmick, a movie about actors made by actors for other actors. It feels intelligent, but maybe it is not. However, when viewed as a metaphor for all lives, people locked in their performances, trying to reconcile their self image with what other people see, negotiating their dreams as they fade into nothingness, it did impact me greatly.<br/><br/>A bit boring at times, it is two hours long, but mostly it is brilliant."

","Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) was honestly a great film. The fact that it has gone from an 8.8/10 to an 8.0/10 as fast as it did bothers me that so many people can't tell the difference from a great artistic film from a pile of crap. Personally I think that the minute a movie wins Best Picture, they just like to bag on it because its the best. Now to the movie itself. Michael Keaton and company give breathtaking performances, and on top of that, it was hilarious. From Ed Norton and Michael Keaton's fight, to Emma Stones wonderful dialogue with Ed and Michael. Behind the scenes: Director Alejandro González Iñárritu has created a masterpiece in 2 months, something that Richard Linklater couldn't do in 12 years. Yes, Birdman was better than Boyhood, deal with it. Though they went back and forth through the awards season, Birdman got what it deserved and came out victorious."

"gearhead359","9","3","8","1 March 2015"," Excellent movie for connoisseurs
","A great story and the acting is very good although Michael Keaton brings a lot of recognizably Michael Keaton acting to the movie. Some actors can be completely different people but Keaton doesn't have to; he is perfect for the role. More on this subject later.<br/><br/>The story is what drives the movie. So much so, you assume the acting is better than it really is. The other thing that makes the movie appear to be so extraordinary is that it not only has a story but human interest and bona fide character development. The unusual but not so mysterious ending is another high-light of the movie. <br/><br/>It is a true piece of movie making excellence that should have rivals but because people are so attracted to special effects and star power, it is becoming a lost art or perhaps just a bad investment. <br/><br/>The movie's backdrop is a insightful comment on the things that makes the movie itself so good and unfortunately so uncommon.<br/><br/>Regarding Keaton's acting; it sure is easy to be a critic which, brilliantly, is another issue brought up in the movie. He is perfect for the role. Because there are so many actors around, some being perfect for the part, do we even need perfect acting anymore? Maybe not. But Keaton's star power may have been exactly what this movie needed to make it so popular. Could any actor have been more perfect for the role? He has been more popular in the past and this movie is an attempt that does make him relevant again without going all special effects. It just keeps getting deeper the more you think about it.<br/><br/>The ultimate and sad truth is that the movie could have been made with excellent but unknown actors and it would not have made any money. We don't know how to look for quality anymore. I am very glad that Michael Keaton set the conditions that allowed me to become aware of this movie."
"marko-balazic","9","3","8","20 February 2015"," Great movie
","You need first 20 minutes or something like that to understand what's going on. If you don't get it in first 30 minutes than you better press stop and watch something else. Maybe you are made just for romantic comedy? OK I don't blame you. Well as I see it, in short it's all about division in Riggan. There are two sides captured in his head or is there just two states of his being. The movie puts question marks in our heads, and that's what I like. Second good thing in the movie are connections between scenes. In example when Riggen find out that his girlfriend is pregnant and she pushes him into another scene. The link between those two scenes is smooth and Riggen instantly starts to play another play. Third it's the end! As I said earlier it gives you that division into your head. You start asking yourself questions is he flying or did he kill himself or something else? Also I have to expose Norton his play is sharp and determinant. IMDb I have to ask you, why he is not on the top of cast list ? Weird. Well anyway we need more movies like this one."
"leonthesleepy","7","3","8","20 February 2015"," Strange, maddening, and seriously overrated.
","There's no doubt in my mind Birdman will divide audiences. You will either go with its heightened sense of reality, or disconnect with it entirely. <br/><br/>Filmed and edited in a ""single-shot"" style, Birdman demands for your complete attention, and never gives you a moment to breathe or look away. It feels very much like a play. It has undeniably brilliant moments, with fantastic performances, impressive camera work, and directed with a great eye for detail. The performances are truly the highlight, with Keaton and Stone delivering career bests.<br/><br/>Keaton in particular, turns in a brilliant performance as the deluded Riggan, an actor washed up and hungry for artistic recognition. In fact the entire cast is great, and there is an urgency is nearly every scene that really captures the chaotic behind the scenes atmosphere. It puts a harsh mirror onto the art scene, where you feel trapped in the business, where the only choices seem to be selling out, or staying with egoistic actors and the pretentious critics who judge your earnest work by spitting on it. Much like a reflection of what is actually happening in the movie industry now. Blockbuster franchises like Marvel thrive while indie movies have a much harder time to survive. <br/><br/>Iñárritu commits so much into the style of the film, that it becomes rather joyless. Everything impresses on a technical level, but never resonates. It succeeds in putting you into the shortsighted view of Riggan by essentially almost never leaving the Theater set and outside street for the entire movie, but it robs the movie of any scale or sense of consequences. Everything felt small. All we see is the set, the stage, and the streets outside the theater, and for a movie that asks you to never look away, its became surprisingly visually bland as time went on. The tradeoff is in the immersion factor, which Birdman absolutely nails. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, i cant say i enjoyed of Birdman. Parts of it has incredible emotional resonance, but for a majority of it, i appreciated its technical accomplishments, yet it felt cold at its core by the end of it. <br/><br/>The brief flashes of dark comedy give it a strange tonal imbalance, with some of the fantasy sequences serving as the foundation for the final shot, which ends on the now clichéd ""art-house ambiguity"" shot. The performances carry it up, and i suspect its a film that art students would gladly study over, picking apart its themes and marveling at its technical prowess. And rightfully so, it should be applauded for that. <br/><br/>As a viewing experience, its decent if you want to try something new, andlike art-house films. And Keaton's soulful performance alone is worth the price of admission, but everything else falls flat and feels empty."
"kevjfarrell","9","3","8","13 February 2015"," Great movie!!!
","So much good acting in this movie. Michael Keaton has soared in my estimation. I really would like to see him get the Best Actor at the Oscars for this performance. Emma Stone is also quite remarkable - surely she must get Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars? There are no duff performances by any of the actors. Ed Norton acts to his usual high standard. This movie treats its audience with intelligence. It works on so many levels and probably needs to be seen more than once to fully appreciate everything. It gave me plenty to think about for days after seeing the movie. I will definitely see it again in the near future. I would recommend this to anyone who is a real movie lover, but watch it when you've got the time to sit and absorb it fully."

","This is a jazzy, swirly take on a life. The photography is brilliant, despite the fact that it could easily have become all special effects; it works well with the jazz soundtrack - still, the technicalities aren't even the most interesting stuff. Instead, this is a human tale of a man who already is what he once was, a superhero, whose life as the core of a theatre play displays his co-actors, his agent, his daughter (who works at the theatre), his problems, his past fame seemingly always prodding him in the face.<br/><br/>The acting from most of the actors (notably Keaton, Norton, Galifianakis and Watts) is mainly sublime and the direction is good; there's a lot of space that's required, much as found in the soundtrack, yet dense enough for a finale that's a little over the top.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film."
"malmborgimplano-92-599820","4","3","8","7 February 2015"," A movie about movies, and not in a good way
","Some filmmakers can create an alternate universe, and others can show you life as it really is. This is the sort of film that tells you nothing except what other movies the filmmaker's seen. It's clear that whoever's responsible for this is a massive Woody Allen fan (there's even a blatant steal from ""The Front"") but that in itself isn't exactly a recommendation, as Woody's reputation as a truth-teller with authentic insights into the human condition kind of went south around the time it was revealed that he was attempting to turn Mia Farrow's household into his own personal mother-daughter harem. Now, I won't say this film is sexist, because I know how that sets people off these days. But when you decide to include an attempted rape in your screenplay, is it really the best decision to immediately have the intended victim blame herself, then use it as the lead-in for an out-of-nowhere lesbian scene? The violent machismo on display here was pretty off-putting, but the depiction of women is downright little-boyish.<br/><br/>I have spent a fair amount of time in Broadway theaters (including the one depicted in this film) but I doubt that the creators of this film have either much experience in or respect for what goes on there. The grossly unprofessional, grossly irresponsible and occasionally criminal behavior of the characters in this film would not be tolerated (well did Helen Lawson tell Neely O'Hara that Broadway doesn't go for booze and dope) and you could simply not do a Broadway-quality live production under the conditions depicted here. While pretending to hold up theater as the greatest expression of the actor's art, it's incredibly insulting how it insinuates that great performances are all about seat-of-the-pants outbursts of egocentric exhibitionism. I can imagine Benedict Cumberbatch, Michael Keaton's rival for this year's Best Actor Oscar, who's actually experienced the rigors of major-league theater and is currently prepping to play Hamlet in the West End, shaking his head in embarrassment if he ever had to sit through this picture. <br/><br/>Keaton does not deserve the Oscar any more than the overall film does. It was clearly an ego trip for him, even if he does grandly show us his unbotoxed skin and (allegedly) unplugged scalp. He's done nothing in this film to be proud of. Actually, neither has anyone else involved in it."

"RyanCShowers","Null","3","8","16 November 2014"," An Innovative Achievement
","From the richness of ""Babel"" and ""21 Grams"", we know Alejandro González Iñárritu has a knack for directing but he transcends to even greater levels of excellence with his astonishing work in ""Birdman"". He moves the camera, frames the shots, and sets up the material superbly but further dazzles you with his diligence in making a theatrical film experience. Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" is one of the few exhilarating cinematic experiences of 2014. It's the type of movie that not only dares some arduous and fresh challenges, but actually surmounts them gracefully.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" develops a technique first established with ""Gravity"" last year in filming entire blocks of time within a scene in a single take. Emmanuel Lubezki helps Iñárritu capture ""Birdman"" with as little cutting in the film editing as possible. It slides around the actors and objects for nearly two hours without any noticeable moments where Iñárritu categorically moves from one separate shot to another.<br/><br/>For 120 minutes, we see ""Birdman"" fly with this technique perfected by the directing and photography. The spirit of the theater is uncorked by this ""gimmick"", but to call it a ""gimmick"" is feels unjust--it's a move of artistic genius and technical mastery to enhance the storytelling. In addition to relentlessly gliding around the actors and through the sets, the cinematography is softly-lit and possesses a tender radiance, making ""Birdman"" easy on the eyes.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" is one of a kind. In the most elegant ways, it pushes the boundaries of art film in mainstream cinema. The screenplays harnesses a meta theme to a dark ideology and comments on show business, specifically how the reputations of actors become linked to certain defining roles, the difficulty in achieving beyond that hump, and the criticism involved with show business in the media-obsessed world of today. With so much creativity on display in the technical and acting departments, the finely formulated dialogue should fade into the background but it doesn't.<br/><br/>The cast of ""Birdman"" slays the project and unifies their talents for a spectacular result.<br/><br/>For Michael Keaton playing this role must be so personal to him, and that seeps through from his real life into the fictional life of his character. Keaton has his fair share of ""Look At Me!"" moments, such as when his character violently demolishes his dressing room, but I find his acting to be more thought-provoking in fragile and sensitive than the noisy scenes, as when he intimately speaks with his ex-wife and daughter about the past. (Though one cannot help but stare silly at Keaton knocking every loud moment out of the park, like when he, slightly inebriated, confronts and disparages a New York Times theater critic at a bar.) This performance is capable of winning him Best Actor at the Oscars and a win would certainly be deserved.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is the right-hand man to Keaton's splendid leading performance. Norton conducts himself with a buoyant, ceaseless energy and won't be overlooked by anyone in the audience. Naomi Watts continues her string of post-""Diana"" supporting roles, and she makes her role in ""Birdman"" terrific, tearing into the audience's emotions to larger extents than other actresses would be able to do in the role. Emma Stone is receiving raves for her work here, though I found her to be a step below Keaton, Watts, and Norton, there's something she brings to her work--a tranquil, quiet stillness most noticed in her final scene with Keaton--that justifies the praise. Amy Ryan and Zach Galifanakis round out the cast. Though they are of the lesser utilized additions to the ensemble, they squeeze everything out of their briefer scenes.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" is resourcefully made, commandingly acted, and ambitiously envisioned; it's an innovative achievement.<br/><br/>* * * * / * * * *<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Birdman is an exiting, well-made film. It is better than many, perhaps most, Hollywood hypes. I very much enjoyed watching it. Michael Keaton's acting is memorable. But is Birdman a better movie than Boyhood? Certainly for the Oscar voters. They have a peculiar taste for a ""best film,"" and, whatever it may be, it failed to recognize such masterpieces as Citizen Kane, Raging Bull, The Graduate, Apocalypse Now, Pulp Fiction, to name some. This year they chose Birdman over Boyhood, and thereby reconfirmed the idiosyncratic nature of their taste. Again, I am not saying that Birdman is a bad movie; it is a terrific movie. Nonetheless, Boyhood is a true masterpiece, a superb work of film-making, a profound description of human life.

There are so many moving parts to this plot that interweave reality and the film it is hard to list them, or indeed perceive them.<br/><br/>Two characters, Riggan, played by Michael Keaton, and Mike played by Edward Norton, carry the film from beginning to end. You might be tempted to see Keaton as a man trying to regain his former glory by pulling this serious play off; but in fact he is a man who views his prior roles as Birdman as no career at all. Faced with the choice of recreating his Birdman role - and getting easy money, or showing the world that he can create and perform something that is indeed both serious and witty, he chooses the latter. Mike is both his last minute only hope to pull it all off, and his constant pain-in-the-ass, any second catastrophic failure figure.<br/><br/>If you like constant action with car chase scenes, real bullets flying, and bare breasts bouncing with intermittent sobbing from broken hearted women, then this is not the movie for you.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you want to see a movie with a real plot, edgy directing and sharp dialog, then see it - - and pay attention!

I'm not a fan of Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts or Zach but they did great work here and I'm totally impressed.<br/><br/>I think this is the sort of movie that you will either love or hate with no in-between. Nothing is told directly and demands our own interpretation. Much like poetry. Maybe even like real-life which is never black or white. <br/><br/>This ""thinking"" movie so mesmerized and entertained me that after leaving the theater I'm still captivated by what I saw and heard. That to me is a mark of an outstanding movie."

","Alejandro Inarritu's Birdman ""or the unexpected virtue of ignorance"" The Film is an enjoyable farce whose cast turn in some memorable performances. Michael Keaton is an inspired choice as the lead, but perhaps the director always had the former batman in mind. His character (Riggan) career shares so many similarities with his own. A washed up actor whose career fell away shortly after achieving stardom as comic book hero, the ""Birdman"". He now attempts to rejuvenate his career. Delivering an adaption of Raymond Carver's ""What we talk about when we talk about love"" to the Broadway stage. Yet his attempts to reinvigorate his floundering career are ridiculed at every turn, the most destructive being the jibes of his most famous role, the Birdman, who exists as a destructive voice inside Riggan's head. Edward Norton's Broadway veteran (Mike) appears, with a performance somewhat reminiscent of Ralph Fiennes in the ""Grand Budapest Hotel"". Leaving his inhibitions at the door, steps in as a late replacement to lend some much needed star power to the play's less than glittering cast. Yet Mike rapidly moves from Keaton's saviour to his curse, overly aware of his own ability and in the process falling for Keaton's recovering addict daughter (Sam), nicely played by Emma Stone. Having recently dried out, Sam now suffers a far worse torture, as her father's PA. Amy Ryan's darkly acid theatre critic, hell bent on dismantling Keaton's efforts is worth a mention as is Zach Galifianakis delivering a refreshingly assured performance. The star of the ""Hangover"" series is dealt with what seems the impossible task, as Keaton's producer, There has been some criticism concerning the more unusual aspects of the film: Firstly the use of ""one take"" shots, the camera following characters as the storm, creep and flounce around the bowels of the theatre and out on to the streets of Manhattan. Secondly is the skittering jazz drumming, ever present within the features sounds cape. Personally neither feels out of place in the film, the magical skills of the cameraman (Emmanuel Lubezki) help to draw the viewer deeper into the storyline while the drumming reflects both the inner turmoil of Riggan, as the stress of the play and the angst of his life in general threaten to permanently unhinge him. The redemption of Keaton's character occurs by discarding his self loathing and embracing the past he finds so distasteful. The powers of the birdman act as the catalyst to achieve the credibility (in a very 21st century sense!) that he craves so badly."

","I had no idea what to expect from this movie - I thought it may actually be a little arty farty but this was not the case. Such an interesting story of an actor who once upon a time played a super hero in the form of Birdman. Come forward many years and this same actor is trying to show he still has It, but as a true theatric actor by backing and acting in theatre on the stage. Most of the movie seems to have been filmed in one continuous sequence or scene, which can be difficult to pull off, but this works well within the context of the story. Michael Keaton is exceptional as the main character, who is spiraling towards losing it altogether. Loved Naomi Watts who has been wonderful in the last couple of movies she has been in. Edward Norton is also outstanding and his character is obnoxious and fascinating to watch. All in all, this movie fully deserves its best movie nom at the Oscars and time flies while watching the two and a bit hours it runs for. Go for it, it's different, but you wont be disappointed!"

","Oscar Season and Birdman by Alejandro González Iñárritu is the first 2015 ""Oscar-buzz"" film I have seen. Iñárritu chronicles Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) attempting to gain credibility as an actor by writing, directing and acting in his own Broadway play. Thomson is haunted by his past action hero persona, dogged by his fans, loathed by theatre critics and undermined by his celebrated co-star Mike Shiner (Edward Norton).<br/><br/>The movie relishes in turning the mirror on its audience, its cast, its crew and its critics. While this can be fun at times, it easily swings right round and is heavy handed. The symbolism that Iñárritu choose becomes so obvious he might as well have been in the theatre asking me: ""Have you got it yet?"" This over-emphasis makes me wonder how much influence Iñárritu had over the final cut as it seems that it was purposefully cut and marketed as ""Oscar bait"".<br/><br/>Cinematography in this film is magnificent, everything is cut to look like one constant hand-held shot. Iñárritu employs simple but clever cutting techniques, such as letting a door close fully to allow an actor to walk back through it to start another scene. This is the real fun of the film, it creates a great sense of the theatre and continuity and this is something you will see many others trying to imitate.<br/><br/>I loved the acting in this film; Michael Keaton just blew me away with his range in the film, it would be almost shameful for him not to win an Oscar. The supporting cast was equally impressive, with Norton playing probably the richest character I have seen him play in awhile. The subtly of Norton's performance comes from his character never really breaking his stage persona, and once again this adds so much depth to the film. Watts and Stone, however, were lumped with clichéd characters and while their performances were impressive, the limited female presence in the film left me irked.<br/><br/>Script-wise the film is a bit shallow. It's a simple plot whose end is transparent from the beginning, it works, but some careful attention could have made it much tighter. The dialogue can be hollow; sometimes this is intentional and other times its distracting. In my opinion possibly chopping off 10-15 minutes would have allowed a smoother flow to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, mostly funny, condescending all too often, and I have a feeling that I am either going to love or hate by this film by the end of the year."

","In Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), Michael Keaton plays former blockbuster movie star Riggan Thomson – remembered best for portraying comic book hero Birdman on the big screen (back in the 1990s). Fast forward two decades and Thomson is no longer a hot Hollywood commodity. Broke, separated from his wife (Amy Ryan), estranged from his rebellious daughter (Emma Stone), and forgotten by his once adoring fans, Thomson sets out to prove that he's not just a washed up hack – opting to write, direct, and star in a Broadway show based on the Raymond Carver story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"".<br/><br/>However, when Thomson is unhappy with the actor cast as Nick in the production (Jeremy Shamos), he makes a last minute replacement – auditioning critically acclaimed stage performer Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) to take over the part. Impressed by Shiner's sincerity (and method acting approach), Thomson hires the quirky thespian less than 24 hours prior to the first preview performance of What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. However, when Shiner makes a scene during his first public rehearsal, Thomson is thrown into a spiral of self-doubt and fear – second-guessing his own talent, personal relationships, career choices, and begging the question: will audiences even be willing to love him again?<br/><br/>Birdman was written and directed by Mexican filmmaker Alejandro González Iñárritu. He's made a film that's both technically astounding yet emotionally rich, intimate yet enormous, biting yet warm, satirical yet sweet. It's also the first time that Inarritu,actually seems to be having some fun.<br/><br/>Birdman"" is a complete blast from start to finish. The gimmick here–and it's a doozy, and it works beautifully–is that Iñárritu has created the sensation that you are watching a two-hour film shot all in one take. Working with the brilliant and inventive cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, Iñárritu has constructed the most delicate and dazzling high-wire act.<br/><br/>Through impossibly long, intricately choreographed tracking shots, the camera swoops through narrow corridors, up and down tight stairways and into crowded streets. It comes in close for quiet conversations and soars between skyscrapers for magical-realism flights of fancy. A percussive and propulsive score from Antonio Sanchez, heavy on drums and cymbals, maintains a jazzy, edgy vibe throughout. Sure, you can look closely to find where the cuts probably happened, but that takes much of the enjoyment out of it. Succumbing to the thrill of the experience is the whole point.<br/><br/>The actual story is focused on more personal matters: troubled relationships, artistic integrity, Broadway versus Hollywood, and the true definition of love. Birdman is about a father, husband, lover, business partner, and actor – not a superhero. Instead of an active plot point, Birdman is a shadowy figure from Thomson's past – one that, above all else, haunts him (as a voice to his self-loathing). He's a shoulder devil, rarely seen but a gripping source of temptation and self- destruction when the actor is vulnerable. The interplay between Thomson and Birdman charts a journey of risk and rejection - along with the pitfalls that accompany personal ambition and sincere attempts at artistry.<br/><br/>Iñárritu has produced an arresting tale of love and art in a time of viral videos and celebrity gossip columns but, in spite of the film's achievements, Birdman is not going to be for everyone. Potential viewers who are hoping for a lighthearted riff on comic book movie culture – where Keaton suits up (again) for action will probably be surprised, and possibly put-off by Iñárritu's contemplative and layered black dramedy. Nevertheless, those open to the film's experimental style will find Birdman provides a thought-provoking and inventive exploration of artistry, family, the difference between power, popularity, and prestige – not to mention what we talk about when we talk about love."

","I've seen many reviews here saying this is a boring film but with good characters. I was so captivated by the characters I did not find it at all boring and found it constantly engaging both through what was happening to the characters and through being able to really feel you were there among the action the action due to the way it was shot. It takes a few minutes to adjust to the continuous steady-cam but once used to it it becomes a more rewarding experience as it seems more real. I wouldn't be surprised if other films follow in this style of shooting. Having said that I believe I would have enjoyed the film even if it wasn't shot this way."
"lh_haglund","10","4","13","13 January 2015"," Simply the best!
","I had to create an account to review this movie and dis-spell some the critiques of this movie. Like the 'Artsy' quality being there as some pretentious 'fuck you'. There are layers to every art form and I can say this transcends a lot and does it well. The chaotic nature of the tone is an intended purpose, the dialogue is carefully crafted and flows with an almost poetic quality. I simply do not get these reviews berating this great movie, I get the twelve year old expecting some wafer thin action/comedy flick about a superhero. The satire of this film isn't only surface deep, it goes as far to criticize the very life of the actors playing their respective roles. As Keaton who played Batman and Norton who is notoriously difficult on set. The shots were complex and masterfully cut. The score set the tone of Riggan's mind, which co-incidentally is also a satire of the method to madness many actors employ on set, mirroring the issues many actors carry with them and ironically carry them to greatness and down again.<br/><br/>There isn't some great conspiracy by Hollywood where pretentious movie critics flock around this movie to SEEM intellectual, however it does seem you need an intellect capable of seeing past a surface to actually enjoying this, so in that aspect a lot of the audience seems to have this movie fly right over their heads. There is a reason this has gotten critical acclaim in the press, and is a shoe in for an Oscar, not to mention it's two Golden Globes. It's not that they're ALL pretending to like a movie to seem smarter, it might be you're just not clever enough to enjoy it."

","Birdman, to put it simply, was exhausting to watch. I don't mean this in a negative way - in fact, it's a compliment. There really aren't words potent enough to describe how masterful the directing, cinematography, and editing are. Birdman is a masterclass of technical marvels - marvels that aren't in your face screaming, ""Look at how amazing this movie is!"". Birdman is a film of subtlety; its message and themes may be hard to grasp but once you grab hold, it's nothing short of an extraordinary ride.<br/><br/>Emmanuel Lubezki. This man is a god of modern day cinematography. Lubezki has outdone himself again after his (stunning) work on last year's ""Gravity"" (which won him an Oscar as well as dozens of other awards) and 2006's fantastically shot ""Children of Men"". Throughout the entire main story of Birdman, the camera. Never. Cuts. Or so it appears that way, thanks to ingenious strokes of editing mastery. Films have attempted long shots in the past, one of the most famous being the tracking shot from Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"". Imagine a shot done just as well, if not better, and with so many intricacies but throughout the entire film. It's jaw-dropping. It makes everything seem so real and focused, and, as a result of this, exhausting to watch. It thrusts the audience into the picture; we are living and breathing in the movie along with the characters. This is a fare feat in film making. It's been done, sure, but not in this way. Not in a way so clever and genius yet simple and subtle.<br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu brings more complexity but seemingly simplistic talent to Birdman with his excellent direction. He knows exactly what needs to be done, how it needs to be done, and when it needs to be done. It's brilliant and thoroughly entertaining.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone all give the best performances of their careers, which is especially notable for Norton given his past works. It never feels like they're are acting; they feel like real people. The performances are, once again, subtle and incredibly natural giving everything a more genuine feel. The rest of the cast is great as well but don't standout as much.<br/><br/>Birdman is a simple movie, or it appears that way. Underneath it's a complex beast full of ideology and philosophy about life, the people we spend life with, and, most importantly, who we ourselves are. It also spends a fair amount of time analyzing what the film industry has become as well as what impact critics have on both artists and audiences. It's a fascinating study of modern society.<br/><br/>If someone were to ask me what Birdman was about I'd tell them it's really just a simple metaphor of life itself. Its beautiful, sad, funny, and enormously rewarding. I couldn't recommend this movie enough. If you're looking for that sense of wonder you haven't felt in cinemas in quite some time, look no further; Birdman came to save you!"

","Riggan (Michael Keaton), who formerly played the comic-book vigilante Birdman, has now became a washed-up actor. In an attempt to regain his fame, he adapts, directs and stars in a Broadway theatre play. But issues raised by his cast and crew make it increasingly difficult, to name a few his daughter Sam has drug addictions (Emma Stone), his co-star, Mike has sexual issues (Edward Norton), his other co-star, Lesley is overly emotional (Naomi Watts), other co- star is overly sexual (Andrea Riseborough) and his producer, Jake is flamboyant (Zach Galifianakis). It all becomes too much for Riggan – but what is different to other mid-life crises, and the only similarity between himself and his former on-screen vigilante, is that he does actually have his super-powers<br/><br/>Michael Keaton, much like his real-life status, has played a former comic-crusader (Batman), but unlike Riggan, he is not washed up, but rather un-utilised. Until now, in this definitive performance that balances the comedy, emotion and physicality in fine tune. One thing that defines Birdman, is the completely unique filmmaking. The term unique is used a lot - but this film really is different. Under the direction of Alejandro González Iñárritu, Birdman, for the entire two hour running appears to be one constant tracking shot that follows the characters and locations throughout with no cuts. Obviously it does, and you can at times guess where.<br/><br/>Overall it is incredible work by DP Emmanuel Lubezki (Gravity). Partnered with the elusive, beating drum soundtrack and stellar performances (particularly Emma Stone) the film is just oozing Oscar's glory. Audacious, entertaining, yet raising many concepts, we tried to like it so much. But it over demonstrates its excess of style over substance and overwhelmed viewing experience."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","3","9","14 August 2015"," ""Birdman"" has provoen to audiences everywhere what movies can do and how film is a beautiful form of art.
","The best film of 2014 is a story that can only be described once you've seen it. The bottom line is that Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thompson, a washed-up actor famous for playing an old superhero named Birdman, who tries to reconnect with his family and fans by creating and staring in a Broadway play. Easy as that may sound, Riggan struggles from the voice of his old superhero haunting him and criticizing him on what he's become. With Edward Norton acting as Riggan's fellow stage actor with a serious ego and Emma Stone playing his druggie daughter, Riggan struggles to find meaning in his life and not be haunted by his image in the world. Director and writer Alejandro Gonzales Inaritu directs this movie in every scene. Not only does the cinematography consist of basically one long shot throughout the whole film that is executed and edited perfectly, but you feel the presence of a gifted artist guiding a meaningful film to production. The tracking shots, insightful quotes about the struggle to find meaning, the hints of superhero culture, and clues as to how everyone in the film is ignorant all help make ""Birdman"" leave a strong impression on creative storytelling and show how brilliant this film truly is. With multiple WTF moments that are executed marvelously, dark comedic attributes, and a look behind the acting business, ""Birdman"" soars in unique style and fashion that earns itself to be an instant classic. This is the kind of film that only intelligent film geeks will appreciate. Not only is the ending hard to understand, but the whole film will appear too artsy and creative for some to contemplate. ""Birdman"" is the type of film that deals with human struggle and insight about life, as well as visual beauty. Keaton, Norton and Stone all give Oscar worthy performances that are filled with passion and wit. The true hero of this movie is Alejandro Gonzales Inaritu, for bringing a masterpiece to life and giving faith in cinema and what movies are capable of doing to the eyes and mind."
"FilmCriticLalitRao","10","3","9","21 July 2015"," Director Alejandro González Iñárritu enables us to watch theater from a different perspective.
","Cinema and theater are two different arts which provide entertainment to audiences.While the former provides thrills for the heart,it is the latter which provides sensible food for thought to be consumed by the mind.It is the actors who end up being a common link for these two arts as they use their talents to provide thrills as well as something intelligible for the viewers.This difference continues to exist in most places.It is for this reason that it is believed that true actors do theater and celebrities work in movies.It is in a very realistic manner that American film 'Birdman' tackles the issue of theater in cinema. What makes this Alejandro González Iñárritu film special is the manner in which he chose some of American cinema's leading stars to pontificate about theater.As a film full of surprises,Birdman reminds us that being unique is the hardest thing to do in a world ruled by technology. This is exactly something experienced by our eponymous hero whose naiveté induces him to remain ignorant of social networks.An artist is so great an enigma that no other artist can unravel his/her inner feelings.This is one aspect of actors all viewers see in 'Birdman'. Lastly,'Birdman' is an honest film which allows its actors to reveal their true identities."

It is perhaps the most important part in the movie because what happens later is based on what they are setting you up for. every expression, every act, every scene is a an expression that is trying to talk to its viewer. in years, I have watched a movie that has a first part which talks to its viewer through actors, script AND direction so vaguely because it MEANT to. Since this part is so delicate that most people lose it here and make judgements about the movie such as being a wanna be artsy film or being boring. More like it is a threshold for REAL movie critics and wanna be movie critics.<br/><br/>Once you get past this beautiful slow paced first half, every story and character begins to unfold into something magical. Everything speaks to you vividly and if you grabbed the first part right, this genre gives you the shock of a thriller. <br/><br/>In all my honesty, it is one of the most spectacular movies I have ever watched. It leaves you with mixed emotions that you don't know whether to cry or to laugh about what happened since it elaborates the feeble world of Hollywood and the extent of loyalty to what you believe in, both at the same time.<br/><br/>The movie is not a wannabe artsy which it is not yet it is a piece of art."

The dialog is fast and sharp, the characters edgy, and the story is richly layered; reality mixes with the surreal, the textured relationship between the play, based on a Raymond Carver story that explores the meaning of love, and Riggan's' own insecurities and failures as a husband and father, succeed in capturing the frailty of the human condition and the value we place on success. The film asks the questions, does any of this mean anything? Are we special and unique, or just fooling ourselves? What defines who we are-- popularity from a deceased career, some deeper artistic ambition, or our relationships? When Riggan flies out the window at the end, what sends him upward? The review of the play (which didn't seem to move him), the constant reminder of his long lost Birdman identity, or that his daughter brought flowers (this time out of love rather than a failed chore done at Riggan's insistence)?"

The relationship between Keaton and Norton gives us some of the funniest and most memorable scenes. <br/><br/>However the true genius in this film is in the direction.

"ali-klima","8","3","9","24 February 2015"," The Entirely Expected Virtues of Creation
","I wrote this review halfway based off the fact that I'm sick of reading poor reviews by people who must not enjoy interesting, unique cinematography. Before seeing this movie, understand that director Alejandro González Iñárritu incorporates a very unique filming technique. Birdman has a total of 16 cuts, meaning that the majority of the film was shot on sequence. This is a task impressive in itself. What makes this movie a great one is the fact that it leaves much to the imagination; it is not another simple product of Hollywood, ready to be spoon-fed to the masses. It requires ongoing thought and the ending leaves nothing to be desired for, and it is entirely what you make it. What I found most striking about Birdman is the interesting character arcs of all those involved, primarily in Keaton and Stone. Edward Norton does not disappoint (of course) in his parodical portrayal of a difficult to work with actor. Emma Stone's depiction of a distant daughter fresh out of rehab is wholly believable and shows the audience her capacity as an actress. The always surprising Zach Galifianakis offers subtle comedic relief and was wonderfully cast as Keaton's manager/friend/producer/lawyer. And yet I was most impressed with Michael Keaton in the leading role. Growing up watching his films, I felt as if Birdman was a kind of tribute to an actor that the public has all but forgotten. As the film progresses, he emits a remarkable range of identities. The washed-up actor striving for fame again, a father reminiscent on his past mistakes, a lover who disappoints those he cherished, and an earnest superhero under it all. His final portrayal as a true artist (certainly not by means of unexpected ignorance) is one to be remembered."

","A movie about Hollywood people, made for Hollywood people. No wonder it got so many Oscars! Some of the acting was fantastic (OK, Ed Norton), but the others were just OK. Michael Keaton was good enough, and Emma Stone had one (and only one!) brilliant scene. The others were downright terrible, with melodramatic lines and deliveries permeating the entire movie. The movie was a pretentious piece of art, trying to inflate its self-worth by constantly mocking culture, the internet, theater, critics, and Hollywood itself, trying to be a satire while at the same time promoting how great it is! Ironically, there are quite a number of lines about how pretentious certain people are, that could apply very well to the whole movie itself. If only its plot was more interesting or fun, maybe you could forgive the bellybutton gazing, but unfortunately it is pretty random and mostly dull, with a few good lines sprinkled here and there. Also, I think this movie subscribes to the Terrence Malick school of cinema that considers random, ""meaningful"" scenes (usually of some landscape or people doing mundane things but with intense music so you know it's full of meaning) more important than an actual story, but I don't like it - a good narrative that makes sense would be preferable.

","Summary: Truth=Birdman=Art=Superrealism=Truth<br/><br/>Pay attention to the scene where Mike says that everything on the set is fake, except the chicken: the chicken is a bird, so Birdman represents the truth. The truth, then, stands itself for art! Micheal, the main character, does not have any power: his inside voice, Birdman, tells him the truth every time. At the end, when he jumps from the hospital and his daughter sees him, he does not fly, but Sam joins the art too, because the art is represented by Super Realism, and nothing is more realistic than giving the life for a piece of art.<br/><br/>Micheal criticizes the criticizer because she labels everything, but she can't recognize art, she doesn't even know the name of a flower. So the entire movie is a rough critic to the actual cinema: people like action movie, such as superheroes movie (Birdman), but no one really cares about theater (seen by rich people who just think where going to eat later, who cannot judge something themselves, but who give too much importance to a review and to a single Name, Mike). Micheal represents the real art, which is not on Twitter, Facebook, Youtube etc. But despite he had the same art inside himself at the beginning of the movie, he becomes popular thanks to a ridiculous joke, when he walks half-naked in front of thousands of strangers. He does not belong the ""social"", as long as he chooses an old book to play on theater, but when you become famous, they know you, but they don't see you (Sam registered him on twitter, but everyone cares just about the half- naked video or the photo without nose). It is also a view of the actors life: if they are good in their job, they ruin everything in their real lives (see Mike), because they shift the reality to the show, leaving their lives, lovers and friends just with a hand of dust.<br/><br/>I've never seen something like this, for the music, for the techniques and for the depth of it.

During the film he battles his past as-well as the stress of being a ""neglecting"" father wanting to make his daughter proud of him, trouble on set, bad reviews and growing tired of himself and his work.<br/><br/>The film has impressive editing that is flowing and seems to be filmed in one take, very impressive and something that should be used in other movies. Could be interesting in war- movies for one, following the protagonist ""uncut"".<br/><br/>The acting is really great, especially Keaton. Could be due to the parallel with Keaton and his character, Riggan's career. Both played a popular action-hero, both are getting ""irrelevant"" and due to this movie, both tries to do something with more thought and meaning behind it. The frustration in Riggan is amazingly portrayed. Very well one of Keaton's best performances' during his career. Aside from that you have Norton and Stone to elevate Keaton even more. Norton plays a cocky actor, well known on Broadway, just taking another job. And Stone portrays Keatons daughter, in a role she's not to unfamiliar with. A woman not giving two ****s about anything, but luckily her character changes throughout the movie.<br/><br/>But is this movie a masterpiece? I can't rightly tell, it's obviously full of metaphors connected to Riggans ego paralleled with his former character ""Birdman"". So obviously the film deserves credit for trying something different and trying to make people think about the things they consume, art, TV, movies, books. You name it. But there is so much stuff that is irrelevant in the movie, if the point is to convey a story about an actor trying to be relevant again then why do you need so much stuff in between? Sure, stuff happen all around us. But here you have the opportunity to show things that are important, relating to Riggan and the frustration he suffers. Like the relation with the actress that he had a pregnancy scare with, or the other actress which he shares like two moments with... It's not often I find Zach Galifianakis important to the story, but in this case he's downplayed when he should've been given more screen time as Riggans manager and friend.<br/><br/>Well as for the ending, I'm not gonna touch that one. Everyone is entitled to their interpretation and that is the point of this movie. Give it a watch!"
"dongillette1","5","3","9","7 February 2015"," Just a bit pretentious but not enough to make you a moron if you hate it
","Films about actors, the theater, film-making, and ""the business"" always seem to get a lot of attention in Hollywood because they think we're all supposed to ""appreciate"" what they do for a living. I don't appreciate what they do any more than I appreciate what any other artist does; I don't appreciate their ""skill"" any more than I appreciate the skill of a good electrician; I don't think they're special and I don't think what they do makes them worthy of million dollar paydays. They are entertainers. That's their job. Court jesters. And in that vein, this was an interesting slice of life from that culture, a very good movie, full of great acting, and both funny and sad. It was a personality study more than anything owing to the fact that the culture is chock full of strong personalities and egocentric characters. So in light of that, it was pretentious--we're all ~supposed~ to like it because it was about our modern-day ""royalty."" We're supposed to oooh and aaah because then we feel like we're sensitive and ""in tune"" with our royalty. But the fact is we don't understand Hollywood, the business, or the dynamic any more than they'd understand us in our jobs. So the film was just okay. Anybody outside Hollywood who gushes about how wonderful it was is reaching--they want to be or understand the culture of the folks in the film so badly that they react as they've been told to react. Definitely worth a watch, but be honest with yourself in your assessment. Michael Keaton was good but I can name a dozen movies where he was better. Edward Norton was good, but again--a dozen movies where he was better. Zach Galifianakis--really? I'm supposed to take a movie seriously that casts this guy in a dramatic role? Laughable. Again--it's worth a watch, but don't go in expecting to see ""Citizen Kane,"" ""The Godfather,"" or ""Silence Of The Lambs."""

Obviously Keaton and Norton have allot of fans for the embellished score on IMD. I would advise any movie goer not to waste their money on this and wait for the movie to stream so one does not have to feel guilty from walking off. Talk about stereotyping a NY theater critic. Raymond Carver I think would have kept the script simple and Keaton would have turned into Birdman once again."

Talent - a frenzy theater asters with spontaneous reactions that normal people will withhold. The secret abilities of the hero doesn't make much sense throughout the movie, I would rather see him splashed at the pavement when he disappeared from the window.

Edward Norton is more pompous than usual, Emma Stone is disappointing. When you have to have a naked man run through Times Square to get a laugh you are near the bottom of the barrel. Keaton seems angry that his career went south after the Batman movies. Whose fault is that? He was good in light comedies, he could have stuck with those but he wanted to show he is an artist and made a bunch of bad movies. That would be his fault, not ours.<br/><br/>Skip this one and wait for Netflix. At least then you can fast forward to get to the end of this mess."

","Not wanting to give anything away, I was disappointed with this film, some may find it clever, surreal, compelling etc. I just found it dull and despite great performances, notably from Michael Keaton, it was simply not enjoyable. I get the idea, the camera-work is original and clever, it makes you feel a combination of being next to~ the character, and being the character, but being clever does not mean a film is enjoyable. If that means I have ""missed the point"", ""don't understand"" etc. then so be it. My advice is, if you want to enjoy great acting, and a plot line, then watch ""There will be blood"", now that was enjoyable."
"Franco_Strydom","9","3","9","10 January 2015"," A psychological journey into your own identity.
","This film runs deep into the psyche of the artist. It's the sum of itself and won't leave the cinema in your head but in your heart. The narrative never asks the audience any questions, it simply presents you with a possible truth and through the nature of the medium the audience superimposes this truth onto themselves and then assesses the result; and that is power. A straightforward narrative in the broad sense, there are few surprises in the plot and the 'big wow' moment is setup in a fairly blatant manor early on. I was a little disappointed by this setup. The presentation of the content had me off balance for most of the film, like I said it made me ask a lot of questions of myself and if the 'big wow' was more of a surprise it might just have led to a profound personal experience. The acting and potential for acting is phenomenal. This script is one of those rare treasures where it's pretty good on the page but give it to a talented cast that can connect with what lies beyond the lines and you have an incredible film. The performance gives it power. Making the audience believe that they are somehow looking in on the truth of what happens in the lives of these people (like films rarely do) becomes super-realistic as people are rarely that honest with each other in their own lives. The characters are rich and vibrant with challenging character flaws and strengths that are complex and informative of the characters. You get to see them when they are lying to each other, then you get to see they turn around and share an honest reaction with themselves. The supernatural element that is and isn't important, which is or isn't a delusion, and that is or isn't real, flows easily into the film. It makes you obviously aware of the film and the medium while keeping you focused on yourself, I mean the character; what better way to get people to question themselves? Never allow full immersion but being so truthful that you can't help but allow it into your mind. Cinematographically the film keeps the unity with extended shots, lapsing time and blending scenes into one another without overtly cutting in the edit. This makes the audience feel more present, more like a peeping tom, more like an invader in this other person's life that makes you uncomfortable, conscious and questioning. The lighting is immaculately done though the flares got a bit much. Costuming and props were spot on, the presence of the wig and the magic of backstage in a theater during a performance, all contributed to the most subconsciously conscious film I've watched in a very long while - consuming more mainstream pop culture than festival films might mean that's a deficit on my part. I'll end off with the dialog that made me cringe and smile. It's a quote from French Novelist Gustave Flaubert and reads; ""One becomes a critic when one cannot be an artist, just as a man becomes a(n informant) (original - stool pigeon) when he cannot be a soldier"" (October 22, 1846). There, in questioning identity, is the power of ""Birdman"" (Iñárritu 2014)."
"SteveMierzejewski","7","3","9","10 January 2015"," Birdman: The Dark Night
","There'a a lot to like about this movie and I understand why it has received so much attention at various film festivals. Basically, it's about a group of dysfunctional people who try to work together to put on a play. The main problem with the film is that sometimes the plot is lost in the clouds of their dysfunction. In other words, dysfunction sometimes takes center stage. On the other hand, it has some thoughtful dialogue much of which revolves around what it means to be successful. What is the true measure of success or of living a successful life? Is it that many people like you? Is it that you are praised by critics? Or is it something more ethereal, such as being loved by people we value? These and other darker, existential questions are addressed by the movie with varying degrees of success.<br/><br/>Although predominantly a drama there are a number of darkly (and not so darkly) humorous moments. The clash of generations, the vapid and transient nature of modern measures of fame, interpersonal relationships, and the clash of fragile egos all supply ammunition for comic relief. Towards the end of the film, people begin to appear more as symbols than as real people, which is not necessarily bad. Much in the entertainment industry is criticized and ridiculed, such as the arrogance of critics who think they can control this world with their reviews. In an attempt to show their power, they will value personal motives over the true artistic merit of a work. It seems like the writers and producers of Birdman are taking their own satiric revenge at times.<br/><br/>The acting throughout the film is tight and flawless. I would not be disappointed if the actors or the film win academy awards. The film addresses some big questions, which makes it more thoughtful than most films and, considering the modern zest for easily approachable box office films (something this film criticizes), may limit its appreciation by some movie-goers.<br/><br/>Keaton's character occasionally lapses into inner dialogues and fantasies which, though interesting in their own right, interrupt the flow of the film at times. There were also moments when I thought the film was trying too hard to appeal to modern expectations or to younger audiences, perhaps as a box office ploy. This was too bad because I thought that the film had a retro feel to it overall. That said, these shortcomings were minor.<br/><br/>In the end, I found it an entertaining and amusing film. So if you want a movie that's meatier than most of what's out there today, you should not be disappointed in watching Birdman."
"jgtemperton","7","3","9","10 January 2015"," possibly not as good as the sum of its parts.
","OK, so like many bozo film fans, I ran into the theater expecting a clever, knowing pastiche of the 'Super Hero' Genre. The modern super hero film is becoming increasingly knowing, the clever CG and the 'graphic novel' a sophisticated character in it's own right.<br/><br/>Birdman, will get this surely, do something clever, making smart reference to the modern film? Sadly it does not, the central character that the film plays with is from that Michael Keaton era of super hero film, the early Batman who was more super hero cut out than anything particularly sophisticated.<br/><br/>It is almost as if the film has arrived at the self referential cinema party ten years too late. There are many smart references to the relationship of critic and artist, the loud and dumbed down international blockbuster vs earnest artsy Broadway play.<br/><br/>For me the two outstanding scenes are when Riggan and his wide eyed daughter face of in a way that only a Father and his grown child can. The scene is full of pathos and Riggans sense of loss of his own relevance and identity is palpable. The second scene when Riggan confronts the theater critic in the bar is also remarkable a fulcrum and catalyst for Riggans sense of identity and purpose in a fast moving always on consumer culture. In this respect the critic is death itself a macabre demon a great deal more sophisticated than the Birdman character who plagues his past memory and present sense of the world.<br/><br/>An interesting film with some real high points bogged down by an anger which is clearly directed at the industry, an industry that is simply a mirror of public taste. With this in mind, who is the middle finger aimed towards?"

","The stars of this movie are Director of Photography Emmanuel Lubezki, editors Stephen Mirrione and Douglas Crise, and drummer/composer Antonio Sanchez. They are the leads in Alejandro González Iñárritu's cinematic tour-de-force.<br/><br/>The acting is, as you'd expect from this collection of actors, of the highest quality. But even these major talents (and they really don't come much much more major than Lindsay Duncan, one of the great names of the British stage) didn't prevent me from taking more of an interest in how the illusion of a film made of one take was achieved. It's even beyond the achievement of Aleksandr Sokurov's Russian ARK, which really WAS in one take.<br/><br/>The downside is that BIRDMAN is so witty, clever, self-referential, culturally aware and artistically impressive that it drowns its characters in its virtuosity. I began to wonder whether that was the director's intention, but I just couldn't believe Signor Iñárritu would be egomanic enough to play a huge joke on his cast and his audience buy spending two hours of screen time satirising egomania. So I guess it must be about something else. Whatever it was, I missed it.<br/><br/>Still, it's a remarkable piece of work, and I'm very glad I've seen it."

","Birdman's plot synopsis, an ageing film star who once was successful in a comic book movie franchise launches a Broadway show in a desperate bid to reclaim his glory and save himself, makes it sound insignificant and dull. It's anything but. It satirizes, critiques and comments on so many things; family, the media, blockbusters, film criticism, egos, fame, celebrity culture and showbiz in general. It's filmed to look like one continuous take and has an amazing ensemble cast. In general, Birdman is the greatest film of the year (Sorry Boyhood) and a masterpiece so captivating I was lying stunned and open mouthed in my seat for the whole thing. There are very few issues, aside from the fact some may find it a bit weird, and this amazing superhero movie which isn't a superhero movie is a devastating, deliriously entertaining knockout blow which has more strength than all the heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe combined. Instead of cartoony villains, boring love stories, explosions and general idiocy this is a reminder of how great films can be, and a reminder of why all these actors are successful.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and even Zach Galifianakis are all exceptional in their roles, and Michael Keaton makes a remarkable comeback. It's amazingly well directed, and the single shot cinematography works remarkably well. The script is not only deep and clever, it's also darkly comic and bursting with raw energy. This is a darkly funny movie. It's a emotionally powerful movie. It's a thrilling and relentlessly fascinating movie. It's a hypnotic and enigmatic movie. It really has it all. This is probably too different to win best picture, but it should certainly be nominated for it. In general, this is a remarkable achievement for everyone involved and a nice break from the formulaic Marvel movies that seem to come out at least twice every year. It will speak to and entertain many people, and there's so much depth and ingenuity in this movie that I cannot wait to see it again on DVD. A must see for everyone. To be honest, a review and description doesn't really do this highly unusual and bold film justice. Just see it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"redhotchilipieper","10","3","9","29 December 2014"," Birdman Soars
","Birdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) has already received a flock of critical acclaim. With an impressive 93% on Rotten Tomatoes and a more than respectable 89 from Metacritic, it should be clear to readers that there is plenty to love about this movie. What will one more positive review going to do? Hopefully, it convinces readers to see one of 2014's finest films and one of the best of the 2010's (a decade that Birdman has a quite a few things to say about.) Director Alejandro González Iñárritu hatches a living, breathing masterwork that feels like nothing else I have experienced at the movies.<br/><br/>The story, although difficult to categorize, lands in the precariously placed nest of 'meta-film' – but in that case – it could just as easily land in the 'meta-theater' category. Obscure as those genres may be, Iñárritu's fifth feature throws in enough comedic banter, existential crises, spot-on satire, taught drama, and surreal suspense to mystify any film scholar attempting to successfully pigeonhole Birdman. Think back to the year's most critically successful film (Boyhood) and the year's most lucrative (Guardians of the Galaxy); while each of these films boast some substantial cinematic creativity, neither of them come close to the unclassifiable postmodern genre goulash that is Birdman. Iñárritu and his three co-writers (Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris & Armando Bo) have crafted a screenplay with a 'meta' feel that does not get off by winking at the audience the entire time.<br/><br/>In addition to its tantalizing cavalcade of genres, Birdman filters its action through an effective art-imitates-life lens aided largely by Michael Keaton's presence. As many critics have observed, Keaton's casting is perfect for the role of Riggan Thomson. Keaton, who played Batman in the two Tim Burton adaptations twenty years ago, has seen his career become somewhat deflated (although not entirely extinct) since donning the guise of the caped crusader. Similarly, Riggan, a Hollywood veteran who played Birdman twenty years ago, finds that his post-superhero acting career is in relatively dire straits. Introspective, insecure, and occasionally insane, the viewer encounters a Riggan who appears to have pulled it together just enough to stage a massive comeback by way of his Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk about When We Talk about Love."" The film chronicles the backstage friction leading up to the play's previews and, of course, the premiere itself.<br/><br/>Within the first five minutes of the film, a myriad of problems arise that can potentially prevent Riggan's play from taking flight. As if Riggan's own perilous ego as the director, writer, and star of the play wasn't enough to worry about, the production must replace an originally slated actor with Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), a world class actor with world class pretensions. When Riggan isn't fighting with Mike over professional ideals, Riggan's alleged best friend and lawyer Jake (Zach Galifianakis) plagues him with reminders about the production's financial instability and impending lawsuit. This all goes without bringing up Riggan's tumultuous relationship with his daughter Sam (Emma Stone), a recovering druggie who Riggan has hired to be his assistant. Oh, and did I forget to mention the voice in Riggan's head incessantly bringing up his past failures?<br/><br/>With all of these factors in play, Birdman offers some of the year's richest characters and most original scenarios. Thanks to terrific writing and an all-around stellar cast, what could have been an ambitious mess becomes an ambitious masterpiece in Iñárritu's masterful hands. Keaton, Norton, and Stone deliver performances deserving of award recognition come Oscar time, but the acting is just one of the movie's exceptional assets. Despite being set primarily in a theater, the film's cinematography is surprisingly dynamic. Emmanuel Lubezki's camera work distracts from the confines of its limited space by being constantly on the move. In fact, the film appears to be composed in one unbroken tracking shot. The unedited feel of the photography intimates the most honest recording of a theatrical performance I have ever seen captured on film, and Antonio Sanchez's omni-present jazz percussion soundtrack provides fittingly kinetic aural accompaniment to the film's frenetic visuals.<br/><br/>Brimming with technical brilliance, Birdman also proves to be indelibly enthralling to witness, especially for stage and screen aficionados. According to Christy Lemire's review of the film, Iñárritu sent the cast a picture of Man on Wire's Philippe Petit walking along a tightrope between the World Trade Centers. The film's every aspect channels this balance between success and failure. Birdman examines and mocks; from its characters to modern culture, nothing is sacred. Thankfully, its critiques dodge didacticism and are never anything less than constructive and thought-provoking. For every bump, twist, and turn in Birdman's roller-coaster, there is a deeper message demanding unpacking from its audience.<br/><br/>Grade: A<br/><br/>By Ben Pieper (November 17th, 2014)"

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","9","24 December 2014"," A complex and brilliant intellectual machine of a film, a soaring accomplishment
","Washed up celebrities, surrealism, truth and the theatre converge into an extraordinary film from Alejandro González Iñárritu (""Amores Perros,"" ""21 Grams""), a master of weaving multiple story lines together tackling dark but powerful themes about human nature and love. ""Birdman"" does not veer from these themes, but it is a dramatic structural shift for Iñárritu; rather than disparate subplots or vignettes, the film is intended to look like one continuous take.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton aptly stars as a celebrity whose heyday ended in the '90s – Riggan Thomson, a.k.a. Birdman. Riggan is about to enter previews with his Broadway debut, an adaptation of Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,"" which he wrote, directed and stars in, yet he's haunted by Birdman, a voice in his head that provokes him and tells him he's above it all. But Riggan has everything tied up in this production: a ton of money, his pride, his self-worth as an artist (not a celebrity) and even his personal life. His daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), is fresh out of rehab and working as his assistant, and he's dating his co-star (Andrea Riseborough).<br/><br/>It all hits the fan, however, when one of the play's male leads suffers an accident and in walks Mike Shiner (Edward Norton). A Broadway star, Mike's views on theatre and acting put him at creative odds with Regan. He also creates more backstage drama because his girlfriend is the play's fourth star (Naomi Watts) and he also strikes up a connection with Sam. Thus begins a series of tumultuous events as opening night nears, where everything could unravel with one bad review from The New York Times.<br/><br/>Iñárritu gleefully plays with reality, keeping the audience constantly guessing as to what's real. This isn't just limited to what's going on in Riggan's head and whether or not he has telekinetic powers; the script floats in and out of its own dialogue and the play's dialogue, blurring the lines between the two, especially because the play, of course, echoes the themes of the film. Iñárritu does a masterful job keeping us from ever quite establishing what's ""real"" in the movie, a tactic the serves to heighten our attention to detail while watching everything unfold.<br/><br/>And my, what details indeed. An entire review could be written about the film's continuous takes, or about the rhythm and timing of all the shots and scenes accentuated brilliantly by a score performed on a single drum set. ""Birdman"" feels like its own organism, with Iñárritu, composer Antonio Sanchez, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and editors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione working in perfect harmony. It's kind of amazing that their work doesn't distract from the story's complexities, let alone bolster them.<br/><br/>The actors are far from pawns in this intricate machine of a film, however. Keaton rises above simply being cast for the obvious ways his career mirrors Riggan's and meets the demands of this role in a way with surprising aplomb. Although he'll go down in the history books as Batman and Beetlejuice, this is the crowning achievement of his acting career. Norton, Watts, Stone and even Zach Galifianakis as his manager/assistant are a pretty extraordinary ensemble of supporting cast members helping him to succeed.<br/><br/>The themes, ideas and commentary about art and celebrity make ""Birdman"" a total critics' film and one with an endless pile of conversation-starters. Each relationship between characters, Riggan's relationship with himself and with Birdman brings its own ideas to the overall film, plus there's the notion about truth in art, being an artist versus a celebrity, the relevance of social media in our lives as it relates to these things and more. Add in how the technical aspects of the film complicate these themes and ""Birdman"" is a total intellectual triumph. It's also darkly comical, dramatic and bizarre, so the entertainment factor doesn't fall by the wayside.<br/><br/>Audiences will enjoy ""Birdman"" to the point that they can play along with Iñárritu's distortion of reality. Getting too caught up in what's real or what's actually going and not exploring the artistic messaging going on below the surface or emerging from the details will make ""Birdman"" a frustrating viewing experience. Expand your comfort zone and imagination and ""Birdman"" takes captivating, creative and majestic flight.<br/><br/>~Steven C Thanks for reading! Check out Movie Muse Reviews for more"
"Robert_duder","8","3","9","23 December 2014"," Absolutely the best artistic film of the year thus far
","I can think of a hundred people who would go see Birdman and walk out thinking it was utter crap. It is definitely not for everyone. It is bizarre, artistic, in your face and it takes a certain cinematic knowledge and experience to appreciate how the film is shot and camera angles and intelligent story points. I'm not implying that anyone who doesn't like this film is dumb...I struggled myself sometimes to appreciate the cinematic artistry behind the story. The thing that Birdman has going for it is that its extremely well acted, fascinated, bizarre in a good way and fun to watch. So even if you don't care for all that ""how it was made"" stuff you might still enjoy watching something a little different. Its a very, very dark comedy and completely different than what I expected. It is a surrealist satire, a play within a movie within a play in a guy's mind. Its about acceptance and being yourself and dealing with fame and ego. Its the type of film I would love to sit and discuss with film students and as I've said about a few other movies, I think a film school could do an entire class based on this film alone. Its completely understandable why critics have latched onto this film. Every year or two you get one truly unique film out of Hollywood and Birdman is exactly that.<br/><br/>I adore Michael Keaton. I've always been a big fan of his. I was excited to see him get back to leading man status. This is a tour de force performance. He is twisted and really disturbed and desperately trying to hold onto reality and life. You watch him in this struggle to maintain his sanity and you began to get lost in what is real and what's in his mind. He is eccentric and hyper and just commands the screen. Not to be outdone Edward Norton returns to a more leading role in a big way as the pompous and loud Broadway star Mike. Norton is amazing. His scenes with and opposite Keaton are absolutely amazing. This is Norton's best performance in years and he has had some great ones. Naomi Watts is also very good (her second great performance I've seen her in lately after St. Vincent) She plays the struggling actress very well and her scenes with Norton are really great. Emma Stone gives a very different performance as Keaton's wild-child daughter. She is very good although it felt weird seeing her in that type of role. Zach Galifianakis actually pulls off not being completely ridiculous as Keaton's lawyer and best friend. He definitely plays the part for laughs but he fits into the tone of the movie which I was surprised about.<br/><br/>The cast is very good together...definitely an ensemble cast. It really is like watching a play on stage where everyone feeds off of each other. The single camera angle that follows Keaton around is a brilliant movie by director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Not only do you feel like you are right in step with Keaton but you feel like you're on stage, back stage, an integral part of the scenes unfolding. You feel the energy and the film is definitely high energy. Its almost exhausting watching it. I don't know how else to explain it. It is complex in so many ways and yet simple enough if you don't try and analyze it too much but how can you not? There are so many questions and bizarre moments and ""wait a second..."" type emotions you'll feel. It really is watching a break in sanity and all the while it actually makes you question your own ego and your own humanity and mortality...yah its that deep. So all in all its definitely not for everyone and I'm not sure I would watch it again, certainly not for an entertainment purpose but I also would completely understand if it took home film awards this season because it is unique, very well made and fascinating to watch. 8.5/10"

","Way back in the 90s, Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) rose to super stardom for portraying the comic book hero 'Birdman'. Two decades later he is broke, separated from his wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan), detached from his teenage daughter Sam (Emma Stone), overshone by his star lead Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) and close to losing his sanity. He chooses to redeem his former glory and pursues to direct and star in a Broadway play based on the Raymond Carver story 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love'.<br/><br/>Although the film's promotion suggests it to be a superhero adaptation, Birdman however is a deconstruction of complex emotions ultimately leading to the protagonist's spiraling meltdown. This is where the film shines as its performances are splendid with each actor truly excellent in their respective roles. Edward Norton as a deeply involved method actor almost ruining the first audience preview of the play and Emma Stone's fear inducing monologue to Keaton are the highlights of the film's supporting cast. With his versatile talent, Keaton leads the high strung supporting ensemble in a role that can be considered his most powerful work till date.<br/><br/>Birdman is written and directed by Mexican Director Alejandro González Iñárritu (21 Grams and Babel). The film was shot in a technique that makes it look like one long continuous take. The camera follows its characters with ease around the stage as well as backstage and is a marvelous feat for cinematography as well as choreography. With awards season just around the corner, Birdman could be a sure-shot contender in leading categories."
"six2561","9","3","9","21 December 2014"," Thinking, feeling movie. It's great!
","People who review this movie poorly simply do not understand this film. I'm not high and mighty, But this is an intelligent, thinking movie and those that didn't like it were quite possibly expecting a Birdman come back action hero movie. This is a movie about Riggan Thomas, an actor who used to play the beloved action super hero Birdman on the big screen. Alas, some 20 years ago he thumbed down a Birdman IV movie sequel and has since been fondly remembered and recognized by fans, but otherwise forgotten about by most everyone else.. Although his role as Birdman is long over, The Birdman has never left him, as his alter-ego is still the voice in his head, for better or for worse. This movie is purely about his life journey to regain the notoriety and status he held all those years ago or to move on from it completely by leaving his mark as the writer, director and star of a hit play on Broadway. The movie portrays the backstage makings of a B'way show to be gritty and dysfunctional with the elements of sex, drugs, alcohol and slander in abundance and personal life struggles of all involved examined. To those who say it's overacted, I disagree. But acting emphasis may have been placed on purpose to put a period on the point of all that was going on around him while dealing with his own demons on the path to his redemption. What was so interesting to me is the movie feels like a play as it unfolds with the amazing filming technique of the continuous shot. This means the camera follows the action continuously, without a break in scene or motion. Several times the shot ends with a long frame of a night time scene only to have the sun rise, building lights turned off all in the same frame, then a continuing pan through the window right into the next scene, following the actors and action unbroken. It's very cool and very effective because you're right there. There's nothing to miss. Michael Keaton is truly genius. His finest moment on the screen. Edward Norton..wow. Better than The Fight Club, if that's possible. And Emma Stone, you will see her in a new light, as a real acting presence. I was shocked! This is a feeling movie. You will feel, especially towards the end. While very funny at times with bright spots of hope, the over all feeling is sad. But the ending is mystical so you can give it a happy ending if you choose. Demographic: Me and Husband, 53 & 62. Avid movie goers."

","I love walking into a movie not really knowing much about it. Sometimes what you read jades you, it's only human. I will try to jade you properly. This movie is brilliant on many levels and it's not loud, it's not CG crazy or shot on green screen. You won't see a lot of flashes and explosions or fast paced editing. There is no 80s hair band post score. What it does have some fascinating humans that are roped together by this Broadway play and reality. <br/><br/>To US movie goers Michael Keaton is a face we've known for a long time. I felt old when his first closeup comes, I thought to myself, Batman was made in 1989. But Keaton aged in good way. His character, Riggan is the once celebrated box-office action hero, Birdman. The film does a beautiful job analyzing his conflict between art, his stage debut and the prospect of doing Birdman 4. I love the technique Alejandro González Iñárritu chose for this first person style narrative. And that's all I'm saying about that. <br/><br/>This movie is not for everyone, but if you happen to be in the production business, you will see it and you'll learn something you didn't know. To me, that's the bonus but to the art film buff Birdman is the next great superhero!"

Okay, so the story is a washed up actor on his last legs of sanity desperately trying to salvage whatever's left of his career, but at a point it becomes arduous to sit through. <br/><br/>This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. If it wasn't for the single take camera-work I don't think it would've gotten any praise or awards. Keaton is an 80s guy (gives a great performance in this by the way, award worthy, ironically), and this movie, if released in the 80s would have got 1 star, 2 max.the acting is great, but it's a painful, taxing watch that leaves you with ambivalence, at best, at the end. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch anything else.

"TheLittleSongbird","9","2","5","9 June 2017"," Very much a divisive film, to me it was a 2014 highlight
","Despite the near-universal acclaim from critics, 'Birdman' very much divided audiences to a quite extreme degree. This division is very much understandable, 'Birdman' has a great many merits but not everything will work for everybody.<br/><br/>To me 'Birdman' was an excellent film. Maybe not quite as good as the hype suggests, but nowhere near deserving of the many 1/10 votes when its merits are a great many that some people seem to have not acknowledged. Although, from personal opinion, a little over-hyped, 'Birdman' ('Gone Girl', 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' and 'Whiplash' were also personal favourites, and 'Boyhood' was also better than given credit for considering the amount of hate it's garnered) was a 2014 highlight and a worthy Best Picture winner.<br/><br/>Not everything in 'Birdman' works. Some of the pace is a touch frenetic in parts of the second half and not everything feels quite as tied up as ought with things left a little loose.<br/><br/>However, 'Birdman' is an exceptionally well made film, with some of the best and cleverest cinematography of the year, some of the cinematography and editing is so dazzling it's enough to take the breath away. The special effects are also tremendous. Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu (in the first of his deserved director wins, the best being 2015's 'The Revenant), 'Birdman' is one of the best directed films of 2014 too and shows Iñárritu's immense talent as a director, with breath-taking vision, sense of mood and the ability to make the story as gripping as possible.<br/><br/>The script is fun, thought-provoking and at times touchingly profound. The story mostly, while sometimes thin, is gripping and the characters engage.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton gives his best performance in years, an outstanding performance and perhaps a career-best. Edward Norton is similarly superb, his performance also ranking among his best. Emma Stones charms and delights too.<br/><br/>Overall, very much divisive, with some people adoring or admiring it and others hating it, personally was one of the people who loved it while acknowledging its imperfections. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

"leegato","10","2","5","31 January 2016"," A Satire About Entertainment Today
","Birdman tells the story of Riggan Thomson, a washed-up Hollywood actor best known for portraying the superhero Birdman, as he attempts to reignite his career by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway play.<br/><br/>The film portrays the struggles Riggan faces in different ""realms"" of the entertainment world which form an ultimate dilemma. On one hand, Riggan must deal with the fact that he is typecast as Birdman and fears he will only ever be known as Birdman. On the other hand, the Hollywood actor must deal with the world of the theater, a radically different and intimidating world that approaches acting and direction alternatively from Hollywood. Overshadowing these issues is the question, is Riggan doing this for his own acting career, or is he doing this just to be relevant in society again? The writing in this film was fantastic. I was fascinated by the psychology of Riggan Thomson's character; throughout the film, he is tormented by an inner voice that represents his alter ego, Birdman. Birdman serves as a character in itself that helps accentuate the satirical themes of the film. In a world where action films dominate the market and actors achieve fame from starring in said action/superhero films, Riggan tries to rid of his reputation as Birdman while Birdman goads him to embrace it. Riggan aspires to be a great actor, while Birdman aspires to be a famous, loved actor.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton delivers an outstanding performance as Riggan Thomson. He perfectly embodies the inner struggle and split that Riggan deals with in the film. Keaton manages to help convey the complex and mixed emotions that Riggan feels as a washed-up actor in his subtlety; nothing ever seems overacted and blatant. I'm rather upset he didn't win the Academy Award, I believe he deserved it with such a tense and careful performance.<br/><br/>Also worth an honorable mention is Edward Norton as Mike Shiner, the famous yet infamous theater actor who joins Riggan's production. Shiner is the foil to Thomson; he represents the theater world. He is difficult to work with and yet is a fantastic actor (In one scene, he learns his lines almost instantly, which intimidates the Hollywood-based Thomson). Ed Norton's performance brought a sense of intensity and dynamic to the film; his abrasive personality made me feel almost uncomfortable watching him as he acted in some of the more surprising scenes.<br/><br/>This film is perhaps the best direction and camera-work I've seen in a film yet. The entire film (with a few exceptions) is made to feel like one continuous shot. What does this do? It allows the audience to experience Riggan's life and torment as if we were actually following him through the tight corridors backstage and in the wide open spaces of the stage. There are no cuts or jumps, much like our own lives. We never ""pause"" or ""cut"" to a scene in our lives, we live it continuously. I was amazed by every take's length and the level of mastery the actors displayed in rehearsing their spots. The film's perspective overall helps the audience experience what show business is like; the audience reaction, the repetition of rehearsed scenes, the feeling of embarrassment when a mistake is made, everything.<br/><br/>At a time where the biggest money-makers in the film industry are superhero/action films, Birdman could not have come out at a more perfect time. Don't get me wrong, I love following the superhero films of our times, but ever notice that Academy Award-worthy films often don't do as well in the box office as, say Star Wars: The Force Awakens? This film points out the truth of the film industry; more people will spend money to watch high-adrenaline action than what critics may consider ""art,"" and so those worthy of recognition may forever go on unnoticed."

"alexcpn","5","2","5","5 April 2015"," A movie for thought
","This is a pretty hard movie to classify; I see so many poor reviews that I felt compelled in a way to write this.<br/><br/>Before we go into what Art is ""or what the real Art as pictured in the film"" is; and for those many who tell this movie is bullshit, so is Picasso to me- however I have just enough commonsense to realize that what I cannot comprehend, is not necessarily bullshit. If for a few seekers, a work uncovers, a hidden truth that they can immediately correlate to, then that according for me is Art. Sunflowers looked like an 'great' painting to me, but without any love, or impression till one day I saw in it, the whole vitality and vigor of life. Many would as easily co-relate to The Scream. <br/><br/>There are many who will get a headache watching Sutter Island; many a normal, happy go lucky person would rather watch any junk super hero flick that that,given a chance. But for some the movie will be riveting. I would any day be that happy go lucky 'shallow fool', that the critics will label, than carry the burden of understanding; The movie is neither bad or good; neither the person shallow or deep. It is just the perspective you see that in.<br/><br/>There is an angle to this movie that may resonate in millions; to appreciate it better, you have to be slightly oldish, having a pretty good 'career',but deep inside, you have the nagging doubt that somewhere along the line, you have made the choice, for the accrual of wealth or power. Well the movie is a tad tedious, but such a life is too, which it aims to portray. All movies are not necessary just to entertain.<br/><br/>Then there is another angle to this movie, ridiculing commercial films, super hero stuff, that has become mainstream movie already. Since this ridiculing is the Art in this film, it is enjoyable and well presented; super-hero films are so popular now, maybe because we have become as vulnerable as children. Cinema is just a projection of human wants, all the range from porn to this; and so you have it a work by the humans for the humans; it is hard to put a number and rate it; it is sometime a genre of its own; and so I rate it in the middle ."

"steven98664","6","2","5","7 March 2015"," Not My Thing
","This movie is for critics, film industry folks, folks who romanticize the profession of acting in my opinion. While the cinematography is cool, some actor performances are strong, the film plot was ever so thin. The struggle of an actor with his ego? The artsy interludes of introspection with visual effects? It is really self involved and cheesy for folks in the film/acting industry to try to highlight the troubles of being a star. I mean are you kidding? Acting and fame are so hard? What? The story of introspection of an actor is really just......like a film crew was sitting around bored and said ""...lets make a film about ourselves!"". Granted, a very talented film crew and actors.<br/><br/>I see the stories told by film in a different light. Maybe I am just a fan of a movie like the made up 'Birdman' they talk about in the Birdman movie. I want a plot that interests me about something. For example, I had just seen Snow Falling on the Cedars (again) prior to checking out Birdman. There is no comparison. Both films cover human introspection and a story....but SFOTC is a story that touches folks and Birdman.....doesn't for me, not even close. I felt nothing seeing Birdman, but SFOTC immersed me in feelings about the plot, the story, and so the characters.<br/><br/>I watched the Acadamy awards recently, don't always. The fact that Birdman won so many awards reminds me that the decisions of the Acadamy don't reflect the public's choice for the best films. The Acadamy's choices truly reflect the film industry's choice for best films, based on film industry folk's interests. Clearly they were interested about a film that highlights acting/entertainment topics that are important to them. Now it makes sense to me."

"Quebec_Dragon","9","4","14","15 November 2014"," The brave, the bold and the brilliant
","I'm a fan of movies in general, super-hero films in particular as well as live theatre, and I loved Birdman. Birdman is not a super-hero film. It's a very intimate and talkative dramedy taking mostly place in a New York Broadway theatre where a formerly famous actor who played Bat-- Birdman many years ago is trying to revive his career by adapting, directing and starring in a serious play. Let's start by perhaps the most amazing thing about this film: an extremely long sequence-shot, without seemingly any cuts, lasting for around 100 minutes! The way it's filmed, it feels as if you're an invisible stalker or ghost. It also sometimes feels as if you're in there with the actors. There's one camera, the same camera, always following a character without breaks. It's not always the same character, and it's not always in the same location. In fact, it feels as if you're exploring the private underbelly of a theatre on the verge of a new production. It might sound boring and limited but it felt very dynamic to me. In fact, the lively characters (popping in and out) and the excellent cinematography made the experience fascinating. I sometimes wondered how they managed that exploit although I have ideas of where cuts were hidden (doors or dark places). Be warned though that some of us with shorter attention spans, now used to fast cuts in TV and film, could find this constant lingering tiring sometimes. Some, like me, might find the effort rewarding. I should mention that despite the very long take (without apparent cuts), that it takes place over a few days, not over a few hours.<br/><br/>I particularly liked how the Michael Keaton's character sometimes heard the critical, cynical voice of what we assume is his Birdman ""persona"". Well, it sounded like Bat-- Birman. Also very interesting to me was how snippets of super powers were shown as if there was more to him than meets the eye. They were not overdone, and they culminated in satisfying, yet short, outdoor sequences. This is not an action film though, very far from it. Don't go watching this expecting superhero shenanigans because you'll be sorely disappointed. This is about relationships and psychology. It's about a formerly popular movie star's desperate quest for respect and admiration, as well as about his theatre entourage. I admit that the parallels of Riggan, the main character, to Michael Keaton's life and how he might be adds a lot of interest that wouldn't be there if the role was played by anybody else.<br/><br/>The characters were played by great actors at the top of their form. Michael Keaton in the lead played the most complex and perhaps broken of them all, in a bold performance going through a wide range of emotions. He has my vote for best lead actor at the Oscars this year. Edward Norton as an eccentric method actor was a hoot. The women were dead-on and just sounded true. Was the movie funny? Sometimes, when it involved unexpected humiliations, interactions with Norton, or clever lines. It was also fairly dramatic sometimes, but it didn't come close to making me cry. I was constantly emotionally engaged though. Not only by the story, but by the characters and, of course, the technical and artistic wizardry on display. I've never seen a film quite like this and I've seen lots of films.<br/><br/>I forgot to mention the very peculiar soundtrack that mostly consists of drum solos, and a little classical music during plays. I'm not sure I liked it but kudos for being different and not totally annoying me. My only other personal criticism would be (to avoid spoilers) the flights of fancy. Sometimes, in amazement, I wondered how they did it without cutting and with people around; sometimes, it looked awkward. Anyway, it's not really important. This is a smart, original and surprising film that impressed me.<br/><br/>Rating: 9 out of 10 (excellent)"

","Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) stars Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, and is directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. It is one of the best films of the year. I wanted to see this poster ever since I heard what the subtitle was. I know that may sound strange, but I'm a sucker for long, philosophical titles. As time grew closer to the film's release, I grew more and more excited, and let me tell you, this film do not disappoint. It was brilliantly directed by Mr. Innaritu, and all of the performances were absolutely first rate. This movie has something to say about Hollywood blockbusters, the theater, criticism, depression, one's place in life, and so much more. It is funny, entertaining, engrossing, and even heartbreaking. When the film ended, my friends and I just stayed in the theater, glued to our seats, discussing the film. That, in my opinion, is the measure of an excellent film. If it can keep a group of people in a theater, discussing it, especially when they plan to go to Five Guys afterward.<br/><br/>Birdman was an incredible film that I can only give the highest possible recommend to."
"williampsamuel","10","4","15","25 January 2015"," A Weird and Wonderful Cinematic Masterpiece
","""I thought I knew what this movie was about. I was wrong"" A man in the row behind me said these words during the first scene of Birdman. That made two of us. I thought Birdman was about a washed up superhero movie star trying to revive his career on stage. And at least on the surface it is. But that barely scratches the surface. Birdman is one of the most complex and multi-layered films I've ever seen. There are deep glimpses inside the human mind, reflections on the nature of entertainment and art, scenes straight out of Terry Gilliam's Brazil or Walter Mitty, and all of it is hilariously funny and completely insane.<br/><br/>Now most movie reviews start by telling you what the movie is about, but I'm afraid I can't do that. I can't tell you what this movie is about, because it is about so many things at once and because words simply cannot do this movie justice. You absolutely have to see this movie for yourself. I mean that. Whatever you're doing, get up and buy tickets to this movie right now! Sorry, I didn't mean to be pushy, it's just that I just finished watching this movie and it's really got me worked up. It's that good.<br/><br/>Alright, that last paragraph was a little crazy. But I meant for it to be, because that will help prepare you for how crazy Birdman is, because it is utterly insane. The people in this movie are crazy. They say whatever they think, which frequently includes thoughts that would never go through a normal person head. They do whatever they feel like, no matter how inappropriate. Ed Norton's character is especially shameless on this count. He will hit on any woman, anywhere, anytime. If something bothers him, he will act out in the most outrageous ways, no matter how many people are watching. He is the ultimate Broadway prima-donna, with no self control, unlimited ego, and the unshakable conviction that he knows true art. In short an unbalanced A-hole who happens to act brilliantly.<br/><br/>When it comes to crazy though, he's got nothing on Riggan, the former Hollywood action star turned Broadway hopeful. Riggan is on the verge of a complete nervous breakdown. And much like Bruce Wayne, he has the voice of his costumed alter ego stuck in his head, reminding him of what they had together and mocking what he's become. And he may also have telekinetic powers. The movie isn't entirely clear on that point.<br/><br/>So this is a very unconventional role to say the least, and Michael Keaton is brilliant in it. He perfectly embodies every facet of the role: the endearing insanity, the anger and frustration, the ego and arrogance, the fear of being an old, washed up has-been. He does things in this movie that few actors of his stature would agree to do. He puts everything he has into this role, and a big part of it is that in a way he's playing himself. This is the guy who did the first two Batman movies after all. And come to think of it, the same is true of Ed Norton. His temperamental prima-donna is the embodiment of every story floating around Hollywood about how hard to work with.<br/><br/>Add Zach Galifianakis as Riggan's frazzled lawyer Jake and the charming Emma Watson as his long-suffering daughter Sam, and the casting in this movie is perfect. So are the writing, direction, editing, and everything else about it. The screenplay blends the real and the fantastic until you can no longer tell them apart. The pacing is flawless, alternating between the serious and the outrageous so that neither becomes overwhelming. The dialog in this movie is more offbeat and maybe more realistic than Tarantino's. And the camera hovers beside the actors, matching their pace and looking over their shoulders so that you almost feel you're standing in the room with them.<br/><br/>And oh how this movie can deconstruct. It thoroughly dismantles the realities of acting; the jealously, egos, and clashing personalities, the overlapping worlds of stage vs. screen acting, and the very act of pretending to be someone you're not. It shrewdly examines the jaded and cynical critics, the entertainment driven news cycle, the public's current obsession with the superhero genre, and our addiction to smart-phones, YouTube, and all things viral, and what it might mean for older forms of media. In a movie where a guy in a latex bird suit follows the star around there's even time to ponder the true meaning of art. This film deconstructs all of show biz in greater detail than Unforgiven did the old west.<br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu simply cannot get enough praise for what he has produced. Birdman is deep, outrageously funny, utterly insane, sometimes downright poignant, and awesome in every way imaginable. I would consider it the best movie of 2014. Like I said earlier, go see it."

This is so much removed from the pap that often derives from US movie houses that your surprise at its 'intelligence' might catch you off guard.

That said, it took me quite a while to work out when it was 'Birdman's alto ego talking (in voice over) as opposed to something actually mumbled by Keaton.

All movies are now measured against this one for a scale of 'bad-ness'.<br/><br/>I get the skills required to make it all like one shot, I get the good actors, I get that it's satire and meant to be clever, but it's pretentious, self-indulgent, the music becomes unbearable and it's simply not entertaining. It's just like watching a clique of artsy people patting themselves on the back for their inside joke."
"Shadowplayed","8","3","10","25 February 2015"," Batman
","We've seen a few Hollywood's self aware and cynical self criticisms in a form of film. Inside look into industry, the heroes and the victims, the ""I'm tiny and unimportant on a grand scale of things""...but rarely so much fun as this.<br/><br/>I was a sceptic. The subject did not appeal to me particularly, I do not care about comic book heroes and washed up actors very much. But I do care about what Inarritu has to offer, as he had rarely disappointed in his fruitful career. <br/><br/>Then there is (almost forgotten) Michael Keaton and Edward Norton in supporting role. I needn't know much more than that to peak my interest. Let's focus on ""Birdman"" (Riggan) to start off this brilliant satire. ""That was back in 1992"", Keaton says, referring to Birdman character in one of his externalized communications with his alter ego, at one point. What else was back in '92? Batman Returns, starring Mr Keaton himself. So, I'm focusing on real life references here, Keaton is playing himself, Birdman=Batman. I thought that was startling and pretty obvious irony, and Keaton has played along perfectly. The role was written for him, as it seems. This actor could do comedy, action and character roles, and he 's still got it. <br/><br/>Apart from all this, Riggan himself was kind of hard to relate to. Unlike Norton's character, this guy was very secluded, he's got quirk and is exhibitionist by nature, but his private world does not get shared with other people. He's crazy, he's entertainer but he isn't approachable. Let's face it...dude's not all there. But he's himself, and dealing with it.<br/><br/>Norton, on the other hand, provides great comedic relief, you must have know people like him, you might even be him! He's method actor, going for hyper realism on stage, lives for acting but shares very little in his private life. Just a real person. Very natural actor, does his thing with unbelievable lightness.<br/><br/>A shout out for Zach Galifianakis, such subtle, completely restrained and toned down, yet very likable role for him. And for the ladies, Stone, Watts and others provided big support with what little space they had within their characters. <br/><br/>Editing is absolutely insane in parts, you see the world through actors' eyes, and it's fast and furious, while preparing to go on stage and do their thing. Score: blasting jazz drumming was a character for itself, stressing tense and important moments as seen through Riggan's perspective. Felt like I wandered off and found myself in the middle of ""Whiplash"" at times. Took me a while to get used to music as character (apparition) itself.<br/><br/>Took me a while to get with the program, really! Something that seems so complex, let's call it ""pretentious"" for lack of a better word and the lack of understanding, shall we, it sure sucks you in: using bunch of well known entertainment industry references, social issues, referencing real world and all the hip stuff you need to do, or have to be to get noticed, to exist.<br/><br/>Absolutely modern, facing the issues and raising questions that are relevant, what is art, how thick is the line between what's ""fun"" and what's ""philosophical, talky bull****"", can a role define an actor, a person...Are we allowed to change, to grow, to rise above ourselves and our established social roles. Who are film and theater critics, and what are those people risking while staying in shades and observing, not moving forward, just being there, nothing to lose, nothing to gain. Perpetuum mobile of pop culture. <br/><br/>It's like a swarm, I swear it resembled one, the whole atmosphere, just very frantic. Can't help but to ask yourself, what does it take to desire a place under spotlight, be a part of this hectic world. It's alluring, glamorous, absolutely seducing, ordinary people feel it too. So, Birdman's underneath all the show biz satire, big questions and overview just that, a personal story, another day at work, theater, home, restaurant...another day in ever beating heart of the city and under its lights. A day in life, less ordinary but one nonetheless... Truth or dare? Dare...."

","I only decided to watch this movie after being advised to from a friend. I didn't believe the hype surrounding the film. I thought it was going to be to style over substance with what I had heard, But after watching it I understand the hype. <br/><br/>The film is very well directed, the long scenes following the characters around the stage etc makes the movie feel very real along with the great acting, which gets your attention. Awesome performances from Keaton and Norton who really carried the film. The story is good made even better by the casting choices. A all round good film i would love to see Michael Keaton in a lot more movies.<br/><br/>Well worth a watch."
"santiagocosme","8","3","10","22 February 2015"," The IMDb rating is well deserved.
","There's always a risk when you watch a movie without knowing anything about it. It's a bit like going to the Opera or the Theatre. You may be mind blown or you may end up really disappointed. At least, at the cinema, the financial risk is a lot lower. <br/><br/>In any case, I have to say, I have really liked Birdman and I can clearly see why not only it is nominated to the Oscars but also it is some people's favorite to lift the trophy. And while I mention the Oscars, I should add that Michael Keaton''s performance is absolutely stunning and probably deserves a statue too. No disrespect to the other actors, but if there's any justice, I think it should go to him due to the complexity of the character's personality. However, Hollywood has been known for liking actors whose characters are crippled, ill, and that have lost 20 kilos for the roleso we'll see<br/><br/>in any case, back to the movie! Even though, It has a weirdish thing about it, probably a product of the bizarre nature of most characters, and it unfolds entirely within a theatre, it was really entertaining and I found myself laughing several times with some of the dialogues. <br/><br/>So not only will I recommend it, but I'll be rooting for it to get a metal at the Oscars. If not, hopefully Whiplash!"
"rubenm","8","3","10","18 February 2015"," Intense, intelligent, intriguing and original
","There's no denying it: 'Birdman' is pretentious, self-indulgent and very high-brow. But it's also a great movie. It's intense, intelligent, intriguing and original. <br/><br/>It's a film about a play that's based on a short story. The characters in the film have things in common with the characters in the play. And one of them also has things in common with the real actor playing him. Michael Keaton, famous for his Batman-character, plays an actor who's famous for his Birdman-character, and this actor plays two different roles in the play based on the short story by Raymond Carver. Yes, it's complicated. And so is the film. Because I haven't mentioned yet that the Michael Keaton character also has an alter ego, heard but (at least in the beginning) not seen in the film. <br/><br/>And as if this weren't enough, the movie is filmed as if it were one long shot. No close-ups, no cross-shots, no sudden cuts. It gives the film a real-life feeling: the audience follows the characters wherever they go, even when they move through the corridors of the Broadway theatre, or when they're walking to a bar. There are cuts, but they are very subtle. <br/><br/>It takes a while before you find out how it all works and connects. But once you do, it's gripping. The film also keeps on surprising with cinematographic gimmicks. The one scene which mocks Hollywood blockbusters is hilarious, but so is the scene which mocks the intellectual New York theatre crowd. <br/><br/>As a matter of fact, Raymond Carver is my favourite writer. After I came home from the cinema, I took his collected short stories from the book case and reread 'What we talk about when we talk about love', the short story the play is based on. It's a great piece of literature. And 'Birdman' is a great piece of cinema."
"sie_francis82","8","3","10","17 February 2015"," Keaton gives an honest and vulnerable performance worthy of recognition
","Michael Keaton has already bagged the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Leading role and is steadily becoming a favourite for the Academy Award (although it'll be hard to beat Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Stephen Hawkings). The interest surrounding Keaton's character in Birdman states a little too close to home as a washed up actor who is remembered for playing a caped, superhero in his glory years. Writer and director Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu (mouthful!) delivers an eccentric, art-house production, innovative film making and an enchanting script with unparallelled performances from its cast. <br/><br/>Actor Riggan Thompson (Keaton) is an actor renowned for his role as superhero, Birdman. Now years later, Thompson attempts to redeem any reputation he has left by writing, directing and starring in a Broadway play and in the process laying his wealth, his family and his sanity on the line.<br/><br/>Each actor adds their own element to the movie which compliments Keaton's character perfectly, instead of just feeding from his reactions. There are some fantastic performances from Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Stone and the brilliant Ed Norton who almost steels the show as an obnoxious stage actor. Keaton, as an actor, has flown under the radar throughout his career, aside from playing some iconic characters which, of course, included Tim Burton's unmistakable incarnation of the Caped Crusader and not forgetting fan-favourite, the ghost with the most, Beetle Juice. His role choices have limited his acting skills to churning out mediocre movies and guest appearances on popular TV shows. It has only been until recent, when taking a part on The Other Guys, did he crop back up on the radar. He is a likable actor and when given free range can prove how versatile he is. Iñárritu gives him that chance and it really pays off. There is something quite poetic about an actor, coming from a background of playing an iconic superhero, who gives his greatest performance of an actor of the same background seeking redemption for the regret of ""selling out"". Keaton gives an honest and vulnerable performance which is worthy of recognition.<br/><br/>For those who are put off by the phrase ""art house"" do not need to steer clear of this one. Its script is funny as much as it is thought provoking and a story that has you invested. The main focus around the plot is the build up to opening night but you can appreciate what the characters are going through even if you are not familiar with theatre. Each and every one of them has their own story and their own axe to grind which bears a huge amount of pressure on Riggan. There will be times during the movie that will appear strange and may require you to find meaning at certain stages; however, unless you allow yourself to accept what is happening on screen then it can become lost in translation. Iñárritu develops a questionable side plot into the script without explaining the how and why; like Riggan being able to move objects with his mind. You are lead to believe that this is an effect of the voice in his head and the hallucinations he has but they just end up being questions unanswered. In true art house form, not every question requires an answer that you can't decide for yourself but for the average movie fan, that will be a bit of a let-down. Aside from that, the pretentious jazz drumming that is used to escalate the scenes gets on your nerves a little bit.. But those are my only criticisms!<br/><br/>Iñárritu's camera form is a joy to watch. He weaves in and out of the corridors of the old theatre building following characters as they interact with each other and onto the next scene, as if it were one long shot. Sometimes you will find a time lapse of a few hours between scenes, in true theatre fashion, but the camera will still be rolling. A method like this could be a little confusing but Iñárritu plays it quite smoothly and you begin to appreciate the brilliant camera work.<br/><br/>Birdman is a great movie with even better performances from its cast. The trailer does not do the movie any justice whatsoever and has to be seen to be believed (if not just for the acting). Those who dislike art house may be scratching their heads at this one but it can be enjoyed for the hilarious dialogue and storyline alone.<br/><br/>For more reviews visit whatsiesays.com"

"TheSquiss","7","3","10","20 January 2015"," Sharp, funny & with career-defining turn from Michael Keaton
","It's not hard to see why Birdman has divided audiences. It isn't an easy viewing experience and it would be all too simple to call it a 'Marmite' film, but it's not as straightforward as loving or hating Birdman; I think some people just don't 'get' it. And, no, I'm not setting myself above all others and claiming that I do get every point and nuance.<br/><br/>Writer/director Alejandro González Iñárritu (21 Grams, Biutiful) has crafted a comedy drama of depression and insanity where the viewer isn't always entirely certain what is going on either upon the screen or in Riggan Thomas' mind. For that matter, Riggan isn't entirely certain where the dividing line is between reality and psychosis, so what hope is there for us? <br/><br/>Riggan Thomas (Michael Keaton) is a washed up, wrung out movie star famous for his role as the titular Birdman. With his film career on the wane, his personal life in tatters and his mental state fragile, he endeavours to kick-start his career and prove that he is a real 'actor' by adapting, directing, staring and producing an adaptation of a Raymond Carver's short story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, on Broadway. The production is troubled with recasting problems, relationships, clashes with inflated and fragile egos and family issues including a daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), who is begrudgingly working as his PA. But these problems are nothing compared to the maelstrom in his head.<br/><br/>Birdman is a very dark and frequently disturbing film that is lightened by occasionally also being very funny. There are snaps of dialogue and physical action that thrust a belly load of laughter into the air to lift the mood and the action, though mostly the action of language and retorts, keeps the viewer on edge. Antonio Sanchez' jazz drum score, however, scratches at the brain so that we are never truly comfortable, regardless of the humour and action upon the screen.<br/><br/>The camera work is an absolute joy to behold. Periodically a film comes along (The Player, Atonement) that causes us to rave about a particular scene that is one long, elaborate shot and which must have been rehearsed and choreographed endlessly. Birdman is comprised almost exclusively of such shots that are so beautifully edited that it is frequently very difficult to see where one shot ends and the next begins, although it is difficult not to be distracted by Iñárritu's skill and play 'spot the edit' rather than concentrating on the film.<br/><br/>Birdman is loaded to the brim with fine performances from Edward Norton's egotistical actor, Mike, to Lindsay Duncan's viciously cutting critic, Tabitha. With solidly impressive support at every turn from Zach Galifianakis, Naomi Watts et al, Iñárritu has filled Birdman with variety and sparkle from his cast. In any other year, Keaton would be looking pretty damn confident in the run up to the Oscars but he has a battle on his hands with Eddie Redmayne's turn in The Theory of Everything. Regardless of how much gold he wins this year, he is on blisteringly good form here as Riggan in what may very well displace Betelgeuse as his career-defining role.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely convinced that Birdman is a film to enjoy, but it is a fantastic, mind-mending, disturbing experience of madness and surrealism that needs to be witnessed more than explained. Take a deep breath and go for it, but don't blame me if you emerge with your head spinning and less relaxed than when you went in.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
"sharky_55","8","3","10","20 January 2015"," An unexpected side effect of desperation - success
","Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance) will be seen by many as an example of art imitating life. Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a washed up and forgotten Hollywood star years on after his success with the superhero blockbuster trilogy Birdman, some equating this to Keaton's Batman. However, this is irrelevant in judging the merits of the movie itself.<br/><br/>The clash of theatre vs. Hollywood and art vs. meaningless blockbuster trash is a very prominent theme within the movie but one must be careful not to immediately place them in a dichotomy as renowned theatre critic Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) does to Keaton's revival, a play he directs, writes and stars in. The same dichotomy is evident in Riggan's mind right from the word go; the menacing voice-over questions his life with ""How did we end up here?"". <br/><br/>It's a few minutes into the film that we then learn his full head of hair is nothing but a wig, and that the voice belongs to the ever present persona of Birdman, the manifestation of Riggan's niggling self doubt at his attempts to become more than just a movie star. While impressively visceral, it may be interesting to study whether the removal of the voice-over would benefit the characterisation of Riggan, maybe magnifying his emotional breakdown mid-film where he talks over the Birdman persona and trashes his dressing room over the loss of control of his play. Nevertheless, later when Birdman physically manifests on screen within Riggan's mind, it is a majestic display. The one-take illusion of the film's cinematography means the film takes place in mostly cramped back-stages and rooms for the first two thirds, only relishing in wide angles and dynamic crane shots to showcase Riggan's acceptance of Birdman as he soars above and around New York. It is also one of the rare times the score deviates from the sporadic crescendo of the drums for a melodramatic orchestral piece that would not sound out of place at the close of a romcom or family film.<br/><br/>Emmanuel Lubezki's work in digitally weaving together separate takes to form the illusion of a single continuous take has had mixed reactions. Some have derided it as nothing more than a gimmick and adding nothing of value to the film. The choice to express every scene in this way makes way for some interesting decisions in terms of camera movement. In one particularly gripping scene, Riggan stumbles upon her daughter Sam (Emma Stone), recently out of rehab, and smells pot. The conversation descends into a vehement and biting rant on the futility of her fathers ambitions and career, perhaps one of Stone's finest performances. Yet one might wonder the difference had the camera chosen to instead focus on Riggan's reaction instead. Nevertheless both actors demand the attention of the camera throughout the film. The look of regret upon Sams face moments afterwards is telling. <br/><br/>In another pivotal scene, Riggan's character within his play, Mel, is giving a passionate monologue on the ideal of love using the example of an elderly couple involved in a car crash. Mel rises from the table and takes centre-stage in an almost over-extravagant manner, the shot cutting out the three other characters in the play. It's a clear stylistic choice by Riggan to push his acting stock and showcase his own talent, much in the same way that the tacked on ending of the suicide of Mel is. Riggan takes quite a few liberties in his stage adaptation of Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". Finally, the one-take illusion allows (or confines, if you prefer) the scenes of Riggan walking backstage to straight, eye levels shots of the long corridors. Naturally then, when Riggan speeds up the camera also speeds up, working in conjunction with the beats of the snare drum to build dramatic tension. <br/><br/>Opposite Riggan is the arguably even more egotistical Broadway actor in Mike (Edward Norton), who portrays a version of the extremely dedicated method actor, often the source of the black comedy's sparse humour with the lengths he goes to achieve realism on the stage. When an unexpected erection interrupts his bedroom performance during a preview, the audience laughs along with those in the real world. Mike's antics constantly clash with Riggan's play and his vision. He lambasts the appearance of the prop guns, and demands to consume real gin on stage, yet brings much needed popularity and audiences to the play. Riggan's conflict is clear; he desires the fame and success of Mike, yet cannot be taken seriously within the theatre world with his Hollywood past. Norton plays the part to perfection, as a cocky, confident and sometimes pretentious thorn in Riggan's backside, flaunting his easy hold over the critics. <br/><br/>Birdman is not without its flaws. The sideplot of Riggan and his partner (also fellow actor) Laura feels like excess and underdeveloped. This results in a very forced and shoehorned lesbian scene between Laura and the fourth star of the play Lesley (Naomi Watts) which hints at the broken relationship of Riggan and Laura, then is immediately dismissed. Riggan and Sam's backstory is developed through exposition via ex-wife Sylvia, and therefore unfolds in an uneven manner from conflict to comfort, seemingly skipping whole swathes of conversation. The whole concept of the title 'the virtue of ignorance' is discussed briefly from a newspaper and comes off as a rather empty justification for Riggan's 'ultra realism' and his final actions. The ending is a interesting matter of interpretation. For me, it's a billboard of Riggan Sam is smiling at, a true sign of his eventual success removed from Birdman. His career is taking new flight. Or maybe the whole scene, including the symbolic removal of the mask/bandages is a daydream of a happy man in a hospital bed. <br/><br/>For the record, I thought Keaton was hilarious in The Other Guys."

"DareDevilKid","5","3","10","11 January 2015"," ""Birdman"" Never Really Takes Flight
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 1.5/5 stars<br/><br/>A former action film star attempts to make a comeback with a Broadway production. In ""Birdman"" , Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a veteran film actor who is eager to rebuild his reputation. Like Keaton, Thomson is largely remembered for playing a superhero 25 years ago. And, like Keaton, he has spent much of the intervening quarter of a century explaining why he abdicated from that role – in Thomson's case, Birdman 4; Keaton, meanwhile, turned his back on Batman. Riggan had played the flying superhero Birdman three times and refused ""Birdman 4,"" and his career went into free fall; Keaton, who, of course, played Batman twice and refused to do it a third time, and whose career — if not exactly in free fall — hasn't been filled of late with plum roles. In the movie, Thomson is heralded by the public as a onetime action hero, and is now playing an earnest, arty role in his own adaptation and stage production of a short story by Raymond Carver.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that ""Birdman"" features some of the finest work in Michael Keaton's and Edward Norton's careers, and another stellar, constant work of cinematography by the veteran, Emmanuel Lubezki, who makes each frame look captivating and frenetically eye-candy at the same time. However, the story is a hodgepodge of dangling plot threads and missed opportunities. While it is true that Keaton's protagonist carries the film, the subplots with his daughter, the lesbian affair, and the failing marriage never tie into Riggin's journey, and these sections of the film leave you with more questions than answers. Initially, the plot is straightforward enough: it's a backstage satire, set over a handful of days, as Thomson directs and acts in his Broadway adaptation in a bid for artistic credibility. The first hour is essentially a Ray Cooney bedroom farce, full of rutting egos and romantic entanglements. All it lacks is for someone to accidentally drop their trousers in front a visiting vicar. Thomson's co-star, Mike Shiner (Norton), is the epitome of strutting, method-acting excess. He is also involved in a fraying relationship with the play's leading lady, Leslie (Naomi Watts); even as Shiner upsets the production, Thomson learns that his girlfriend, Laura (Andrea Riseborough) – and second female lead – is pregnant, while his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is fresh out of rehab and struggling. Gradually, strange kinks assert themselves in the narrative: moments where Thomson levitates cross-legged in mid air, or takes flight across the New York rooftops. Along the way, Director, Alejandro González Iñárritu, and director of photography, Lubezki, let the film appear as if unspooling in a single take. It's a nice piece of artifice; but much like the film itself, it's a superficial rather than substantial attraction.<br/><br/>The actors digs at narcissism, ambition, insecurity, the wages of celebrity, and the ""cultural genocide"" of Hollywood verge on the indulgent. ""The play is starting to feel like a deranged, deformed version of myself,"" Thomson says at one point. Ha, ha, yes; we get it! The second hour strips back every outstanding plot point to focus entirely on Thomson's meltdown as opening night approaches. But it's difficult to engage with Thomson's plight: his character is depthless and self-absorbed, and Iñárritu's film isn't half as clever as it thinks it is.<br/><br/>Also, the last shot of the film seems to change the rules established by the first hour and fifty-eight minutes. Overall, while the ""Birdman's"" performances are a joy to watch, the story fails to have any cohesion."

","One of the best films i have had the pleasure of watching in the past year. Strong performances by the cast, I mean each and everyone of them, makes every minuet of the movie so pleasing and made me asking for more. There is not much of a story here and ninety percent of the movie is shot inside a theatre; however, it is so interesting and mesmerizing you wish it lasted longer. By far the best Micheal Keaton movie I have ever seen. Also, my favourite Emma Stone performance as I am not a big fan of her work. The camera work is exceptional. There is a certain fluidity to the movement from shot to shot. Not only the scene changes but also the time and mood change too. There is a darkness full of of colours. If you are not a fan of ""philosophy and long talks"" this is not for you. The dialogue is so rich and full of meaning one can take so much away from it. So many life lessons here that everyone may interpreted in their own way. I absolutely recommend this movie and I hope you watch it."

","To me this film defines art. It's a phenomenon that will be remembered in cinema for years to come, and the best comeback of any actor I've ever seen by the superhero himself, Michael Keaton.<br/><br/>A washed-up actor, (Michael Keaton) who once played an iconic superhero must overcome his ego and family trouble as he mounts a Broadway play in a bid to reclaim his past glory.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is art. From the filming to the acting, to the tone, to the satire, this film is a superfilm. It's a play in the sense that most of the movie is a series of 30 minute continuous shots that showcase the behind the scenes of Broadway, from the actors, to Riggan's personal and business issues, etc. So much is going on, but you feel like part of the action. The film's satire is out of this world, taking on topics about the cultural genocide of our society, thinking behind an actor, a director, and even a film critic. It's the best satire I've ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>It doesn't stop there, there's tons of superhero references from films, to clichés, etc. It's all about Keaton dealing with his ego from his superhero counterpart. The film takes several risks, hits em every time, but they're so smooth and subtle that it hits perfectly.<br/><br/>The all star cast is irresistible, as everybody is perfectly cast. Emma Stone as Keaton's daughter who deals with drug recovery is truly supportive, Edward Norton is badass as usual, and Zach Galifianakis is hilarious as always.<br/><br/>If this film doesn't win the Oscar for best picture, then I have no hope for humanity. It deserves it much more than any other film I've seen, so I got my fingers crossed."

So here goes.<br/><br/>I'll start at the end. When I left the picture-house (cinema) after watching this movie, I felt elated. Not some kind of fake high but a real sense of euphoria of being me. For the sake of being me. A feeling of pride in myself and a feeling of tremendous self-worth.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's because the first movie I ever saw in a cinema was Michael Keaton's Batman as a 10-year old boy, and he rekindled something from deep in my past, or maybe because it was just a really f**king good movie.<br/><br/>I mean... I was just glued, it was beautiful and just enjoyable. It had everything. Witty characters, amazing cinematography, surprises, out-loud laughs, I felt like the actors who were in this movie must have been having a blast when making it and that transpired onto the screen. There was just so much positive energy in this movie, it was just...electric. Despite the fact that the characters were what some people might call ""depressed""...trust me they weren't. Even if your life is in crisis you can still be very happy and that's what this movie proved.<br/><br/>It was cleverly made. The claustrophobic atmosphere of the theater and the first-person perspective moving through the corridors of the theater really made you believe you were there. On the big screen it looked amazing. Everything was so perfect it looked just...ordinary. Which was perfect. I'm not saying the movie was perfect, there's no such thing, and I'm not saying it's my favorite movie, there's no such thing either, but it's an entertaining movie that deserves your attention and theater ticket fee because God knows Hollywood doesn't make films like this very often anymore."

","Just finished watching Birdman. It was super duper fantastic. Two hours of a single floating uncut scene that just mesmerizes you and gives you a feeling that you are in the strangest dream you have ever imagined in your life. I think by this movie Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu leveled up the seventh art. As I always say, Inaritu is the absolute master of cinema. His movies are one better than another.<br/><br/>The cast performed a great job, especially Michael Keaton. He was absolutely drowned in his role. I think people will speak about this flick for a long time and refer it as a classic in a new genre. I hope Inaritu wins the Oscar in directing this year! but who knows!"

","American movies are still breathing. It merely took a special film like Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Birdman to reinvigorate them. It's a film no one expected but one for which we're utterly grateful. It's a hysterically funny and brutal assessment of American movies and stardom, paired with a philosophical journey of existence, where the self dissolves once unsatisfied by love and artistry. We are surprised because Inarritu has never made a film like this before. The films he has directed, including 21 Grams, Babel and Biutiful, are generally realistic, moody and highly dour efforts. Birdman is unique to his filmography given its high energy levels, comic tone and inseparable combination of fantasy and reality. Spearheading the film's cast, Michael Keaton provides crucial autobiographical elements to the thematic content. The film is triumphant, soaring with comic energy and stimulating us with its plethora of ideas. These qualities are also presented with fine craftsmanship, confirming its filmic sophistication. I laughed frequently watching the film and I have thought long afterwards about its deepest meanings. <br/><br/>Full review at: <br/><br/>http://www.impulsegamer.com/birdman-film-review/"
"lacroquevielle","9","3","11","26 February 2015"," Great movie! Why are there so many bad reviews?
","I'm really surprised to see how many one-star reviews of this film there are, it's just shocking. At least, at least, you have to give Birdman credit for its great performances - Oscar nominations for Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone are not a coincidence. The whole cast is really good and convincing, and just for that it deserves at least some stars - one would think.<br/><br/>Plus, the cinematography is remarkable, making the ""one take"" illusion very convincing. The music - granted, it's not ""beautiful"" - I think serves perfectly this kind of movie: it's always building suspense, and surrounding everything with a sense of unease. For me, it works. Then the script... If you don't like black comedies, that's fine, but you just can't fail to recognize there is genuine humor in several of the scenes (Thomson walking naked around Times Square, come on). And the way each ""scene"" is related to the following - which is necessary because of the ""one take"" - is very well done. Technically, it's a very accomplished film, in my opinion, and I just can't see how anybody could overlook that and give the film just one or two stars. That's for Zookeeper - but Birdman, please.<br/><br/>And, although this is more subjective, the plot itself is very compelling and interesting. Thomson, because of his ego, doesn't want to embrace his past, and tries to be someone he is not. You can tell - great performance, Keaton - that at first he doesn't really know how to act in his own play, and Mike makes this very clear - genius performance, Norton. But then, when he starts accepting who he really is, his quality of acting really improves, and at last he gives one of the best performances Broadway has ever saw: all of this, because he is not acting anymore, he is being himself, with all his past and his ego, and that's just what the protagonist of the play needs. And that makes sense, because he wrote it, and is an adaptation of Raymond Carver, who is in a sense the source of his acting ego. At least, I see it that way, and for me it really works.<br/><br/>Nine out of ten, maybe because is somehow lacking development for some characters. Maybe 8/10. Even 7/10, if you just dislike this kind of movie. But one or two out of ten? Come on."

","Love him or not Michael Keaton rocks, and as Birdman he is the bomb, Totally love this movie and all the actor's, it has guts, with plenty of charisma and adult entertainment, I only wish I could of jumped into the picture and adlibed lines of love for each moment without being a distraction, but to be a real actor and entertain people, to make them believe what your saying is real and do it from a script is a really tough job, never mind remembering all of your lines and their's if your brain is that gifted, for me Birdman is about a hero character named Batman that was best ever played by Michael Keaton, yes he has done a lot of other great work, but in my mind he tops Batman in this role, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Zack Galfinas all bring it too, but I just wanted to say more than anything, this is the kind of great movie making that makes me want to become a actor, director, writer, producer that is just a dream for most and especially me because I don't like being in the spotlight, everyone who made this movie clearly have earned their wings and do."
"haosstoposto","8","3","11","26 February 2015"," Interesting viewing
","This film reminds me of Synecdoche, New York"" starring the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. This time we see a process of making a theatre play with all up's and down's of all involved. It is also a look behind the curtain where all the glamour of the stage is revealed as a stressful and repetitive process where the actors sometimes go insane. I will not elaborate much about the story of the movie, many of the scenes have been shot in one take which is a proof for a masterful director. The cast is very strong and Michael Keaton proved he is a serious actor just like his alter ego on the screen. The only weak link in the movie is ending which seemed strange to me, because I do not understand why Birdmans delusions are being present in his daughter. All in all a strong movie, but perhaps not an Oscar material."
"nicpro85","10","3","11","8 February 2015"," Super Realism
","From what I saw the movie speaks about itself the entire movie. The actors are acting foolishly their role of actor acting a piece on stage. There is a mise en abysm that talks all the time to the viewer giving the feeling that at some point the real actors are improvising the movie. This makes their role all appear very narcissistic but actually real as if they didn't had the time to think the movie but instead had to live within its course as the camera rolls and that is what let them become someone on screen. Actors seems sold to the desire of the movie that will just run with or without them. The play ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" in the movie is actually the movie Birdman. Thus the miracle of an empty space becoming a real movie.<br/><br/>Birdman is probably someone ability to reunite all those actors and just make a movie about a movie and show on screen what it looks like in reality when the miracle of Birdman occurs. Like their counterpart that seems to change the script at each representation, the movie is also an attempt that would be different every night. In the film, the actors literally undress as if they were asked to do something crazy and had only a second to decide which resolved in them undressing themselves, a thing that give the feeling that all those naked bodies where not in the script and makes us think that probably a lot of the movie has been created during the editing. Anyway dialog seems meaningless in the movie. There is a feeling that this movie is about real actors living theirs actors life on stage while the movie is filming itself."
"mattjc3","10","3","11","6 February 2015"," Birdman: An Absolutely Phenomenal Movie
","Birdman is like no other movie. A perfect addition the Dark Comedy genre. The cinematography was amazing. The soundtrack was amazing. Acting was amazing. Lines, plot, etc...<br/><br/>However, the first time I saw this movie, I walked in 5 minutes late. I didn't think it would matter. I was with 5 of my friends, some of whom do not have a taste for good art or film, sometimes during the movie they'd show me a text or a picture on their phone, which, is ironic considering the movie and messages in some of the scenes. ""Have a real experience!"" Anyway, since I picked it up late and was distracted, the movie was moving so fast that I had no idea what was going on. I couldn't tell what exactly was happening and was unable to follow the story. The music served as this loud feeling of anxiety and I ended up not liking it as much as I thought I would.<br/><br/>I have now seen this movie four times start to finish, and it is amazing. No other movie offers what Birdman does. The second time I watched it, it all made sense, and the quick editing and music went from being my least favorite part to my favorite. It truly is genius what they have done with this movie. I learn and appreciate something new every time I watch it.<br/><br/>I recommend all to see it with an open mind, and be sure to focus on the movie! Do not see this if you are going to be looking at your phone or talking to your friends, you'll miss the subtle brilliance and it wont make sense. Dedicate yourself to this movie while you watch it. Oh, and make sure you get comfortable. I was very uncomfortable when I first saw this movie, it makes a difference.<br/><br/>The messages I personally got had a profound impact on the way I look at film and art, and I will be enjoying this for years to come. Michael Keaton as Riggan Thompson is currently my favorite movie character, his demeanor, attitude, and mannerisms are all in line, and I felt a connection with him. Some scenes in this movie may seem slow, but if you are paying attention you'll pick something up that will make you say, ""Oh, wow, *now* I get that!"" It's amazing. <br/><br/>(This paragraph does not necessarily contain spoilers because it does not give you any plot information, but it does briefly quote Michael Keaton's character and give the smallest details on two scenes so that people know which ones I'm talking about. In my opinion, if you have not seen the movie, this is still very safe to read.) One of my favorite scenes is when Riggan walks in on his daughter sitting at a desk by herself. Emma Stone's monologue in that scene became one of my favorite parts of any movie, it made me tear up, multiple times. I felt a special attachment to it. Keaton's character's response and the music that accompanies it is so wonderful, you can't help but laugh after those dark lines preceding it. That's what this movie was to me: a critique of modern day life, but also, and more importantly, a critique of itself. Cynicism is rampant and this movie tackled it with perfection, handling it with strong opposition yet understanding its necessity in life. To see what I mean by this, watch the scene in the bar when Riggan is talking to the woman from the Times. He executes that beautifully, ""Aw what is this crap? These are all just labels!...Cause thats what you do! You just label everything! 'Cause you're so f***ing lazy!""<br/><br/>The imagery, the motifs, the irony...it's all so beautiful. And as far as the ending goes, I don't really care what happened or didn't happen, because to me that's so far off from the point of the movie. People's mistake is that they take it so literally and miss everything in between. I highly recommend this movie. It is currently in my Top Ten somewhere, and was one of the only movies I thoroughly enjoyed this year.<br/><br/>Wonderful film."

","The drum is beating relentlessly as the camera moves down narrow and shabby corridors, pauses in an actor's backstage dressing room, both of them seeming to have their best days long behind them, the movement, the claustrophobic space and the drumming intensifying to a foreboding, threatening atmosphere that turns this dirty underbelly of Broadway glamour into the darkness of a tortured man's soul. Michael Keaton who was Batman plays Riggan Thomson who was Birdman. A former movie star way past his prime trying to resurrect his career by turning to the stage, establishing himself as a serious actor and battling more himself, his diminished self-worth, his shortcomings as a husband and father than any outside pressure. His demons are with him – literally, in a move that quotes Keaton's Batman days. Keaton, a seemingly washed-up has-been plays a seemingly washed-up has-been – and he does so with a force, an honesty, a self-effacing radical relentlessness that would guarantee his an Academy Award almost any year (though perhaps not this one due to Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Stephen Hawking). A man struggling between outside appearance and a growing inability to escape the inner voice, Keaton's performance is one for the ages.<br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu has the camera follow his protagonist with intricate and never- ending tracking shots as we accompany him through the labyrinth that is a theatre's hidden undergrowth and the maze of a trouble soul. The rhythm of the camera, the nervous pounding of the drum, the tortured dishevelment of Keaton's face all convey the sense of a human soul and mind becoming unhinged and struggling to recover any sanity he can muster. The existential fight of an individual navigating the shaky line between the personal and the public. González Iñárritu effortlessly moves from the naturalistic to the delusional and the dream-like fantastic as reality ans imagination become harder and harder to tell apart. He bridges that fragile frontier as well as time gaps in single, apparent unedited shots, time and space become fluid and as unstable as the protagonist's mind. Keaton is surrounded by a staler cast led by Edward Norton playing a sociopathic actor whose search for truth has turned him into an extremist in life and work. He is Keaton's nemesis, foil, catalyst to unleash his power. Then there are Emma Stone as Riggan's troubled and ever angry daughter, Zach Galifianakis as loyal friend and choleric manager, Naomi Watt's as a self-conscious actress impatient to make it and Andrea Riseborough as Riggan's lover torn between cynicism and a longing for closeness.<br/><br/>As good as the cast is, the miracle this film is lies in its ingenious story-telling. How Alejandro González Iñárritu weaves camera, editing sound and Keaton's acting together, the way he combines drama, fantasy, comedy and satire (his portrait of the New York theatre industry is quite poignant), how he infuses it with New York's manic heartbeat and has it all mirror in Michael Keaton's face has not been seen in film before. In an Oscar year in which Richard Linklater redefined film making by stretching time beyond the hitherto feasible, González Iñárritu reimagines the possibilities of filmic story-telling. Birdman is one of those films where the critic's pen must fail. It needs to be more than seen, it has to be experienced as the complex and ridiculous symphony of light and dark, of the universal and the trivial, of the human condition and poignantly funny comedy that it is.<br/><br/>www.stagescreen.de"
"KineticSeoul","8","3","11","2 February 2015"," Very original!
","By the title, most audiences would think this is a comedic cheesy superhero movie. However it's nothing like that, instead it's a existential, philosophical story on human consciousness and in this case revolves around a washed up actor that now works in Broadway theater. The focus on detail is just amazing and the dialogue is intriguing, I can't say entertaining but intriguing. I could see why this movie could be perceived as boring, especially for viewers that isn't into art house movies. However the cast did a amazing job of bringing out the realism of this film that and the direction when it comes to the cinematography and story. As a matter of fact when it comes to the cinematography I will just say I could tell that a lot of effort was put into it. Mainly because a lot of the scenes are done in one very long shots. It's one of the few movies that I have seen that has the appearance to be done in just one long take. Careful editing and meticulous planning was in play. Overall this film is very memorable and it's an experience that last. So yeah, I highly recommend this film.<br/><br/>8.6/10"

I have no idea how they managed to make such a great movie in such small period of time. I'm big fan of Emma Stone and she definitely deserves Oscar for this performance.

That means something, it wasn't a completely random ending because many people share interpretations... it was left to interpretation.<br/><br/>I admire Alejandro Iñárritu for taking risks and made a movie that could've gone terribly wrong, but ended up being awesome.

","If Michael Keaton doesn't win the Oscar for his role, I'll shoot my nose off to spite my face! This film is absolutely amazing in it's assembly, dialog and acting. Don't ask me how, but Ed Norton pulls off an amazing James Dean in this. And sadly what kept me from giving this movie a 10 is that he wasn't in it enough. But the other 9 go to Michael Keaton. Somehow he exudes himself, Riggin Thomas, Christian Bale, and Bruce Wayne through out. The irony of it all, and the fact that Keaton IS such a good actor outside of his previous typical roles in such a untypical movie about a play that will surely win Keaton recognition that he may or may not actually crave in reality... To grapple with all that, and pull off such a brilliant performance in spite of it all...? And for any other self imposed 'critic' to say 'Meh' here or the New York Times, It just makes me realize the importance of Norton and Keaton's confrontations with the feared 'critic' in the movie. And what an asshole I must look like now. Damn, my head hurts, I think I better lie down for a bit. Smells like an awesome movie in here. And hope I 'saved the day' for Mike and all."

","If the title doesn't wake sense it's because this movie takes some time to wrap ones head around. It is shot to look like one continuous shot and this gives the film a surreal feeling. I was uneasy when watching this film because I as a viewer am not accustomed to see a film without cuts. The camera isn't immobile either throughout and it isn't like in Russian Ark where the camera moves like a ballet. The camera here dances around the characters like rock and roll. And this movement is disorienting as much as it is a good ride. The camera gives the story intensity, rapidity and drama. The story is well told: a now director who used to be a blockbuster actor wants to create a significant play to feel relevant again. He has issues with his actors and family and all that drama unfolds around the play. The main character experiences delusions as well and this is explored throughout the movie. The acting is fantastic and it is hard to look away when Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone are on screen. This film has to be seen by any cinema buff simply because of the unique cinematography."
"cameraslie","10","3","11","12 January 2015"," The Perfect Metaphor
","Long shots, with little to no editing during scenes - the perfect way to relate the art of film to the art of theatre which it depicts, where crew and cast get one chance as they are live, Birdman captures its scenes continuously, amazing us at how a whole crew and cast have achieved such perfect sequences. Then somehow special effects are thrown into the mix, and we're left wondering ""how?"". I had to watch again just to admire the film production techniques, as appreciating both these and the story presented seemed too much to handle in one viewing. <br/><br/>Birdman is also clever in its combination of imagination and reality, showing us the action and what must be a daydream of sort, with no separation so we don't know where to draw the line. All we know is that this is how Riggan (Michael Keaton) sees it, and that is the only perspective we need, allowing us Riggan's internal point of view in a way normally exclusive to novels. On my second viewing, I found myself questioning even more, what ""actually happened"" in the film.<br/><br/>Birdman tells us the story of Riggan, an actor who formerly played a superhero, trying to adapt, direct and star in a play, in a career revival attempt. During this story, we are invited back stage where Riggan has to manage his business and personal lives, involving a challenging co star, daughter, ex partner, and lawyer, all of whom have demands he must cater to for his show to happen. Everyone has their moment, and all the characters stand out as some point, with Riggan's central story sometimes retreating and serving as a vessel for theirs to happen around his. Expectations are not met, and some moments of this film will cause complete disbelief, as each character reaches an extreme in their arc.<br/><br/>Unique in its subject matter, production techniques, it is rare for a film to be so different from everything else and still be this good. Nothing I, or anyone can write, will do the film justice, You have to watch it, must watch film."
"nepeta","6","3","11","11 January 2015"," Interesting film by very ageist for women
","Watched Birdman, interesting script and camera but as usual I got disgusted by the typical age gap between female and male actors. The protagonist is Michael Keaton (64), his ex-wife Amy Ryan (46), his lover Andrea Riseborough (33). The most important female actors are women aged 27 to 46, all very good looking. The only female actress of his age is the critic Lindsay Duncan (65) who is called that woman that looks like she sucked the buttocks of a man. It's disgusting to see that women are seem as sex meat from 12 to 39 and after they're 40 they're just ghosts and witches. I cannot be impartial, films like this are dictating that women are only worth before they turn 40, and we see this influence in real life too."
"RforFilm","10","3","11","8 December 2014"," Birdman reminds me that I should always trust Michael Keaton under any hood.
","The hardest thing about being an actor is that it is a very unforgiving profession. While a steel mill worker is given a big send off retirement party when he leaves, an actor faces something very different. They are in the trend business and just like fashion, have to fathom new ways to continue staying relevant, therefore continuing to get work no matter how demeaning it is. It's the dream to be able to walk down the red carpet to the applause of millions waiting, but once a star gets a taste of it, they'll continue to be thirsty for that love. <br/><br/>If you talk to anyone who used to be a big actor in Hollywood or Broadway, they'll say that their biggest regret was not taking some deal that could have made their career last longer. Perhaps it was an award winner or even a big blockbuster, but every actor will admit to wanting to be back at the top. What's tough about that is that most folks over the age of fifty do quite understand what the young people are into. There's no easy way to figure it out, but these actors need to find something that will get them attention again. Perhaps Birdman can give them inspiration?<br/><br/>Riggan Thompson (played by Michael Keaton) is a Hollywood celebrity who has career has been in decline since his days playing a superhero named Birdman (yes, it's supposed to be like Batman). He is in the process of making a comeback by writing, directing, and staring in a play in New York. He's getting help from his producer/lawyer Jake (played by Zack Galifianakis) and the play is starting his girlfriend Laura (played by Andrea Risborough), Lesley (played by Naomi Watts), and another actor that doesn't last long.<br/><br/>A fallen lighting rig injures one of the side characters (we learn that Riggen had planned this), so they are lucky enough to get Mike Shiner (played by Edward Norton) to fill the place. Mike is anything but easy and even stops a preview performance when Riggen switches his real gin with water. It doesn't help that Riggen's adult daughter Sam (played by Emma Stone), whose a recovering drug addict, has littler confidence in her father. Riggen also keeps having a vision of his Birdman counterpart mocking him and his show. All Riggen wants to so is prove that he still matters in the world of entertainment.<br/><br/>Birdman benefits not only from a very good story about acting, but with how it's shot. It has a behind the scenes feel as the cameras It has the look of a continuous take, which probably resulted in the actors having to memorize longer pages of dialogue, just like theater actors. It's very Kubrick in pacing and tone, almost what Interstellar was trying to go for, but Birdman pulls it off much better. Even the soundtrack is close to a Kubrick feel as most of it is classical. <br/><br/>Going back to the acting, I've always been a big fan of Michael Keaton who has been underused in recent years. Blame the Hollywood system, but Birdman proves that Keaton has got a lot of ability to play different characters. He is a big Oscar possibility. Rounding out the rest of the troupe, Edward Norton plays kind of a parody of himself as his character is difficult to work with (as is rumored with the real life actor) and does it well. He's the theater guy who is fighting back against the film actors trying to step in on Broadway territory. It's clear that the message here is that while acting is tough, trying something else for glory is a big risk, but whether you want to continue living in a shadow of a past is your decision.<br/><br/>I'll give this five Birdmans out of five. Birdman is the most avant-garde of the big award movies coming out, so it's clear that if you want something more linear and straightforward, it's not here. But Birdman is still one of the best of the year thanks to it's classical musical- like tone that's both haunting and entertaining."
"Emberreviews","10","3","11","28 November 2014"," A modern masterpiece that demands your attention
","The film stars Michael Keaton as a washed-up actor named Riggan who had previously been made famous for his portrayal of a superhero called Birdman, a theme that fans of a certain late 80s superhero film may already be familiar with. In this movie, Riggan is attempting to create a new name for himself as a theater actor and put on a Broadway play in which he is both starring and directing. As the play draws closer to its premiere, Riggan is forced to deal with not only the pressures of uncontrollable actors and a ravenous public eye, but also his own past as Birdman coming back to haunt him as he tries to reinvent himself.<br/><br/>This has been one of my most anticipated movies of the entire year, and I'm happy to say that all of my expectations for it have been met. The duality that Riggan suffers as he's torn between his movie star past and his Broadway present serves as the core of the movie that seems forever divided against itself, and this struggle is blown up to unimaginable levels in the movie itself not just through Riggan's own personal ordeals, but with the conflicting ideals of the entertainment industry as a whole. There is a ton of back and forth between what constitutes a celebrity versus a ""real actor,"" the popularity of summer blockbusters versus the art of true storytelling; even the idea of going viral versus becoming a legend is fleshed out to an incredible degree, but still manages to share the spotlight with Riggan as a person.<br/><br/>This movie even takes time to take a jab at movie criticism as well. I, myself, have had a lot of problems with what critics will often write in a review because they use a bunch of flowery language and ""intellectual"" phrasing to belittle a movie, yet never take the time to actually sit down and take in what the movie is really offering them, and there's one scene in this movie that addresses this problem to a T as Riggan just digs into this critic who tells him that she's going to give his play a bad review simply because she hates what he represents, and it is by far one of the most gratifying scenes that I've ever seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>Even with all of that, the movie never forgets that it is still a piece of entertainment, and delivers an enthralling level of struggle within each major character in the film, accompanied by some of the best acting that I've ever seen. Edward Norton plays a theater actor who struggles with the idea of him acting in real life and only being truly himself when he's on the stage, and his character incorporates notions of method acting and obsession with realism and takes them to a whole new degree. Emma Stone plays Riggan's daughter who is going through her own issues with her relationship with him, Naomi Watts shows the internal struggles of an actress who's finally made it to Broadway, Zach Galifianakis plays Riggan's agent and lawyer who's trying to keep the play from falling apart at the seams, and every single one of these actors gave an incredible performance that I won't be forgetting any time soon.<br/><br/>The technical side of the movie also exceeds expectations with a style that makes it appear as though the entire film was taken in one shot, which I honestly could not believe until I actually saw it. Sure you can pick out where they probably cut to move to another set, but the fact that every single scene moves seamlessly into another was not only incredibly impressive, but also gave the sense of the film never stopping to catch its breath or giving it any sort of lull. This movie feels incredibly fast-paced almost the entire time, and the way it was filmed certainly had a lot to contribute to that. Even the films all-percussion score, interlaced sparingly with clips of public domain works for added effect, seemed to drive the story forward with an unrelenting beat that refused to slow down.<br/><br/>Birdman is, quite frankly, a modern masterpiece that demands your undivided attention for its entire run time. It is a film that transcends mere entertainment and becomes an experience, and my only regret is that I was unable to see the movie when it came out two weeks ago. You do not want to miss this film."
"wdchilds","9","3","11","21 November 2014"," Startling for story and visuals.
","Not the best film ever, but one of the best this year. Story, Character, performance, and especially cinematically, this is a tour de force. I was engrossed for nearly a third of the film before I noticed what an engaging and effective cinematic style I was watching. Wow! The whole cast delivered such amazing performances that I can't say enough about. Seamless delivery, layered performances. I can watch it again, and this is not an idle statement. This is the first film that I've felt the need to voice my strong endorsement of in recent years. I found that I was brought into the story from many angles. Being of the theatre, I was happy to see both the realistic portrayal of the backstage milieu and the complex interaction both on and off the stage of everyone involved, from the electrician to the producer, from the lead actor to the critic. Flawless!"
"squirrel_burst","9","3","11","20 November 2014"," A strange film, but don't miss out on this unique experience
","I'm just going to begin with saying that I didn't absolutely love ""Birdman""... but I did really enjoy my experience of seeing the film and on a technical level, I think it's absolutely brilliant. This is the kind of movie that your average audience is probably just going to be baffled by, but if your top-ten list of favourite movies includes at least one drama and you're the kind of person that likes to check out off-beat, more indie type movies, you should definitely check this out. It's a black comedy with some awesome cinematography, like so good it will blow your mind, great performances, a lot of sorta-kinda unanswered questions and some truly unique moments. It's the story of Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton). He's an actor that used to be really big, but now he's nothing more than a trivia question for superhero enthusiasts ever since he left his iconic role, ""Birdman"" twenty years ago. He is currently attempting to reinvent himself and trying to give his acting career some credibility by writing, directing and starring in a play adaptation of Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". Things are not going well, and it isn't helped by his mess of a daughter (Emma Stone), the ambitious actors, or the egotistical lead. Oh and Riggan may or may not have superpowers and has a voice inside his head.<br/><br/>I had no idea what to expect with this movie. I knew there was a man with telekinetic powers, he was going to be hearing voices from a guy called Birdman and that it looked like a craaaazy movie. It certainly is a film that's different, but I enjoy different and if you do too, I think you'll dig it. The most startling thing that I noticed was that for the most part, the film is shown in one long, unbroken shot. That's incredible. Can you imagine how much choreography, rehearsing and expert timing went into making sure that everyone was on cue, recited their lines and allowed the camera and sound people to follow them, move around and ensure the story kept going smoothly? It's absolutely insane! For me, this wasn't just a gimmick. It was a way to get totally immersed in the movie. This movie is about a play. What's the difference between a play and a movie? It's the lack of editing. If you forget your lines on stage, that's it. You screwed up, let EVERYONE down! Because of the way it's shot, the acting in the film is like the acting of a play, except that it isn't all set on a single stage with phoney doors that get moved depending on what ""room"" the actors are in. You actually get to walk around and follow the characters. This added a whole other element to the movie. This is a small production that is not going to fly with your typical crowd. This is a movie that is taking a chance. Just like the characters inside the film who are putting themselves on stage and performing this play. I'm used to seeing movies with editing in them, so seeing a movie with no ""breaks"" in it made me hyper aware of the tension the actors would have been feeling making the movie AND that the characters inside the film would have been feeling. It's a wild experience.<br/><br/>Still on the technical side, I found the movie to have terrific music and sound editing. For most of the film we have drum solos, perfectly timed with the action and at least a couple of times you can actually see the musician in the background. It really added a lot. We then have performances that I thought were nothing short of brilliant. Not only do we have actors giving solid performances as these characters, but a lot of them also act as actors inside the movie. It's one of these inception performances, with the actors having to act extra well to portray (in some cases) bad actors inside the movie.<br/><br/>What about the story itself? It's a weird one, but I liked it. A lot of the characters are messes and I wanted to see where they were going to go. Seeing all of the backstage play stuff was interesting, even more so because you don't know if the play is going to be a success, or the end of Riggan's career. Then there's the whole Birdman element that throws you completely for a loop. Is he crazy? Does he have super powers? Is he going to give up on acting and go on a rampage, ""Chronicle"" style? He's not the only interesting one either. Everyone here feels like a real person, they're all vulnerable and panicking, fully aware of the odds against them. Dark comedies are hit or miss for me, so I had mixed feelings at first, but the more I think about it, the more I wouldn't mind seeing ""Birdman"" again so I could discuss how the movie made me feel and how some of the subtle elements reflect the real world and the actors cast in the film.<br/><br/>This is a weird movie. It means it'll make you think and maybe that's something you're not used to so at first, you are going to feel like you got bamboozled. Regardless of how you feel about the characters and the actions of the film there are some things that are undeniable. Technically it's amazing, it's going to be unlike anything you've ever seen, the performances are really good and it's a movie that will affect everyone differently. Did I love the movie? I'd say I liked it more than loved. What I did love is the experience of watching ""Birdman"". It's a very ambitious movie and you're probably going to hear about it quite a bit in the future, so don't miss out by not taking a chance. (Theatrical version on the big screen, November 18, 2014)"
"KnightsofNi11","9","3","11","20 November 2014"," Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
","Sweet baby Jesus where do I even begin my appraisal and admonition of this masterpiece of cinema? Should I start with the masterfully crafted totally original story? Or maybe the brilliant screen writing that perfectly blends existential drama with pop culture savvy? Or perhaps the cavalcade of stellar performances coming from every direction? Or maybe even the groundbreaking cinematography that presents possibly the best use of a steadi-cam ever conceived? No, you know what? I'll make it simple. I'll start out by saying that Birdman is good. Really. REALLY. Good. In 1989 Michael Keaton quickly jumpstarted his way to fame in Tim Burton's revered Batman film, which he followed up with Batman Returns. Ever since, Keaton's career has gone through it's ups and downs, his name slowly slipping away from household notoriety. And now he stars in Birdman as Riggan Thompson, an actor whose life suspiciously follows a very similar path to Keaton's. Riggan is an actor who garnered his fame by playing the fictional superhero Birdman. Years after the success of this franchise dwindles Riggan finds himself a wash-up, trying to validate himself by producing, writing, directing, and starring in his own stage play which he hopes can make it to Broadway. Meanwhile Riggan's friends, ex-wife, daughter, colleagues, bitter rivals, and the voices in his head all stand to help or hurt him in reaching this goal. <br/><br/>Rarely do I walk out of a film as excited as I was after leaving Birdman. I don't remember the last time I had such an immediately positive reaction to a film where I was able to so quickly come to the conclusion that what I had just watched was an absolute masterpiece for the ages. Birdman left me with a sense of joy, excitement, and an overall feeling of inspiration and true genuine wonderment. Birdman is genius. Birdman is astounding. Birdman is brilliant. Birdman is, dare I say it, perfect. OK, maybe not perfect, but pretty damn close. Birdman exemplifies some of the most incredible original storytelling in one of the most inventive and revolutionary ways I've had the pleasure of witnessing in years. It brilliantly takes such a simple story and adds so many ingenious plot devices and visual elements that make this one of the most unique films I've ever seen. It's a story that introduces us to many eccentric characters, some lovable, others hateable on such an entertaining level. It then takes these characters and weaves them into a wacky and weird tale of love, life, jealousy, and ambition that has an offbeat unconventional atmosphere that perfectly matches the strangeness of the characters, all backed by the smooth flow of the visual style that strings us along through this wild fantastic ride. <br/><br/>No words I can write on this site give Birdman the justice it deserves. This is simply just something that has to be experienced. Birdman takes you on such a magnificent journey through drama, comedy, existential crisis, and even a bit of fantasy to add yet another incredible visual element. Birdman is a photorealistic painting that, the longer you stare at it, starts to become this bizarre surreal art piece in a league of its own. I don't even want to explain what the hell that means. I just want you to experience it<br/><br/>Seeing Birdman might be the biggest favor you can do yourself this year. It exceeds expectations on every level, and honestly provides you with one of the most unique cinematic experiences you've ever had. I believe Birdman has the power to change the way we think about film and entertainment. It's going to make waves, and for a damn good reason."
"blanbrn","8","3","11","16 November 2014"," Michael Keaton's best performance ever! It's a bird life and bird on the brain!
","Finally saw ""Birdman"" and I must say that it was a pleasure a film that was entertaining and a joy, as Michael Keaton does fly and soar in this role of past his prime actor Riggan Thomas. I always liked Keaton in my opinion he was the best ""Batman"" ever Michael always had range and depth with his acting choices, and with this he nails the best performance of his life! Keaton plays Riggan Thomas a past his prime washed up actor who after many years of success starring in a superhero franchise called ""Birdman"" decides to fold the tent on the role. And now Riggan has taken up life on the Broadway circuit making a living as a stage actor in plays. And Riggan's life is a mess he's divorced and he deals with a march to the beat of her own drum daughter named Sam(Emma Stone)who's just got out of drug rehab. And while working on the play Riggan has conflicts and personal clash problems with his co stars first up is the arrogant and playboy type method actor Mike(Edward Norton)and Mike is hitting on Riggan's daughter Sam and also he's trying to put moves on fellow co star and play cast member the emotional and cute colored bra wearing Lesley(Naomi Watts). Thru it all Riggan is dealing with family and his critics and his ego, and most of a challenge is how ""The Birdman"" memory haunts him Riggan hears voices and has visions of his once beloved superhero character. Overall this film entertains and is one that shows life is a challenge when you try to overcome people, and ego still if you have good memories on the mind it can help you soar to new heights in life just like that of one Riggan Thomas."

","Let me start by saying that I was angry at birdman winning Oscars in its year, especially because I wanted so badly for Nolan's Interstellar to win it. But, afterall, I decided to watch it because The Revenant bugs me, a film from the same director. <br/><br/>First of all, the way it was shot, to make it look an entire two-hours long scene was well done. The director whom name I still haven't learned deserved the Oscar entirely. The whole thing was enough interesting to keep me interested for the movie's full lenght. The ending was cryptic enough to make you think about the meaning for quite some time. That's something I like in a movie. Also, very creative soundtrack, made almost entirely with percussion instruments. What instead made me strike one mark off is language. There was so much vulgarity It, for once, disturbed me. <br/><br/>After watching birdman, I ask myself, why all that hate? Because it criticises almost everything. Movie-making (Though Oscar electors liked that), Actors, stage theater, superheroes, journalists, common people and so on, by showing all the stupidities of the world of nowadays.<br/><br/>I strongly believe though that rating a movie like this with a rating lower than 6 is very wrong. Even if offensive, it deserves at least consideration for the direction and acting."
"Hitchcoc","7","2","6","23 May 2015"," Certainly an Ambiguous Challenge
","Michael Keaton and Edward Norton are terrific. They are wonderful actors in nearly every sense of the word. I was engaged most of the way, but then the flying sequences. He is indeed a broken man. He is probably schizophrenic, listening to himself discuss his failures through the persona of the character he used to play. Enough has been written about this movie (it was the darling of the Oscars) for me to offer much. Nevertheless, I feel that we need to play fair with the audience. If this was a demonstration of what is wrong with Broadway and the Broadway crowd, let us know. There is a great scene where he confronts a powerful theatre critic who can make or break a show with a bad review (I never understood the power of these people) and chastises her for her vindictiveness and and arrogance in ruining peoples lives when she, herself, must not face the music. I'm sure her editors would disagree, but what he says is true. Unfortunately, as we roll to the end, we are made to make up our minds. I suppose it's OK not to be one with the character, but the ending is truly ambiguous, to a fault. Fantastic acting by the whole cast, yet it left me really cold at the end."

","Tremendous performances from everyone. Outstanding indeed! As a songwriter/artist/music producer, I can tell you it's very hard to achieve what these actors(and the director) have accomplished. A lot may go unnoticed to the untrained eye, but it's all there, very well captured. Half the magic would be gone if I went any further. All I can say is this is the real deal, flawless acting.<br/><br/>The only thing that bothers me is that this movie leaves no stone unturned. Everything is explained, every aspect gets to be covered - ""but, Leo-you-hardcore-reviewer, this is mainstream, you should be aware of that, right?"" Yeah, I guess so. Yet, I confess there were times I felt the narrative rather patronizing. <br/><br/>Maybe that's what it takes to get the message across. I've heard people label it as a ""crazy movie"". It's not. If someone says that, it's because sensitivity meters are jammed(unfortunately - we need more sensitivity in our lives).<br/><br/>Last, but not the least, ""Birdman"" is a pleasing gliding ride."

","Isn't it funny how in only a few short years the internet has given the power for even an average Joe like me to critique a movie despite the fact that I wouldn't have a critics bone in my body. Be that as it may this review wont use loose adjectives and a couple of paragraphs much like Michael Keaton said to that critic the night before opening. A movie has to be absolutely horrible for me not to sit through it entirely so that gives this movie a plus. Keaton does a stellar job portraying his character but sadly the same cannot (this is just an unprofessional opinion) be said of Galafianakis with his horrendous melodramatic overacting and Watts with her bland.. well just bad acting. As an Australian I surely found myself squirming in my seat every time she appeared on screen knowing that she was dragging this movie down with her poor imitation of an actor and that was quite surprising considering that this is the crux of the movie... being mainly about acting. Nevertheless all that aside this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie, one which you should not miss. See it if not once just for the experience. 9 out of ten rubber actors."
"xodanielcasterox","10","2","6","24 April 2015"," Batman...I mean Birdman!
","This has nothing to do with Batman except for the actor, of course. Speaking as a fan of Tim Burton's Batman and as a guy who likes to have an unusual but unique experience in films/TV shows/Books/Videogames, Birdman is now one of my favorite films of all time! It's one of those films where you can't really explain exactly why you love it so much because it has such a unique impact on you that you can't really find the words to describe it. A washed up celebrity who used to play an iconic superhero (kind of like the actor minus the washed up part) is starring in a Broadway adaption of Raymond Carver's book ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" to show he is more than just formally a superhero and a real actor. But he is having trouble keeping his head straight when things go wrong and he has to fight to keep this play afloat. Michael Keaton has proved to me and everyone that he is more than just Batman, he is a real actor and a damn good one. The cinematography? Oh my god! This has to be the best cinematography I have ever seen in my entire life. I constantly ask myself, ""Why didn't they do this in the past?"" Emma Stone is pretty good, I still think she did better as Gwen Stacey from the Spider-Man reboots. Edward Norton is such an ass but he is so good at it. Zach Galifianakis? Really? He wasn't great but I don't think he did that bad. Anyway, don't call it by it's full title ""Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" it's much faster and memorable just to call it ""Birdman"" First he was a ghoul, then he was a Bat, now he is BIRDMAN!"

But I believe that was for the best. The movie takes you out of the regular Hollywood experience and makes you realize the importance of theater and the thirst so many real artists share for being on Broadway.

Michael Keaton was AMAZING as Riggan. You can tell he put his absolute all into his performance. You really, sympathize with this character, this guy who really just wants another shot at his career, another shot at life. He sees this play as his second chance and he's determined not to let anything get in the way of making it and making it good. You also get really involved in the other characters. Edward Norton was amazing as this method actor, God he is a penis !!!! He was so obnoxious, the actor who just thinks he knows best, and God, I have met a whole bunch of people who are just like that. Emma Stone...how could you go wrong with her ? The writing of the film is really well written. The idea of the voice inside the head was awesome. That just continues this emphasis that this guy is really loosing his grip on reality after the birdman character (who was a huge part of this mans life) was taken out of his life.<br/><br/>If I had any problem with the film, and it would be a minor one. It's that I don't get the ending, and I know it's meant to be open for interpretation but I just didn't get it and I'm going to need an art film fan...guy to explain it to me.

","Everything about Birdman just fell neatly into place. The extended takes and camera choreography was just one small piece to the crazy puzzle that makes this movie an astounding achievement.<br/><br/>The whole film was scripted to be detailed on a ""meta"" level. Actors cast as caricatures of themselves, playing to each other across a single long story thread just like the play that they are performing in the story of the film.<br/><br/>Every cast member essentially playing a blown out caricature of their actual selves.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton's performance as Riggan, in particular, was quite inspired, and clearly drawn from some amount of personal experience, with his fellow cast members attempting to support him and his Broadway stage comeback while simultaneously undermining everything he's doing by doing things their own way.<br/><br/>It made for entertaining viewing, which, having spent a lot of time around drama types, I found to be genuinely funny in a number of places. The way that Riggan interacts with the character that made him famous and his ability to suspend reality in order to lead the life of a character he played for the majority of his career, while funny, also ponders similarly to ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" on the topic of the suspension of reality and how the human mind can create abstract visions of what could be done if we harness the power of our minds...<br/><br/>In reality though the film makers have made both a technically accomplished film, and one that is enjoyable from start to finish, thanks to good humour and great casting. It's the freshest telling of a story in film that I've seen in a long time."

","I saw Birdman, twice, and am starting to wonder if I saw a completely different film than anyone else did. I loved it. The performances were spectacular. The directing, writing, score, and cinematography were all perfect. Literally everything was amazing. Don't listen to all the Birdman haters out there, watch this movie. There are so many reasons to watch it. I think the reason that so many people are hating on this movie is because it is not what one would expect when walking into it. It is, and I cannot stress this enough, not what one would expect from any movie, let alone a Best Picture winner. I watched this in the theater the first time I saw it and after I had seen it I walked out saying ""What the f**k just happened"". It was not at all what I had expected I would be seeing. When I saw it the second time, at home, I was able to fully appreciate all of the comedy, weirdness, and general coolness of the movie, because I knew what to expect. For all the people who didn't like this movie, try watching it a second time, you'll probably like it a lot better. Also try to take this movie for what it is, a comedy that satires the Hollywood machine. It is that, and nothing more than that.

While I did not always like the characters, I always felt invested in them regardless. They all have their moments. <br/><br/>Edward Norton is in my opinion the best actor or actress in this film. His character is not per se a ""good person"" by any means, in fact he is capable of being a rather bad one. But his character was the realest to me, and I would blame it on Edward Norton's powerful performance. <br/><br/>That said, all the acting is fantastic. It seems like they all pushed themselves or perhaps it is because of the director. This film may not be for everyone, I would label it artsy, and it reminded me of Black Swan. Not because it is super tense, but because sometimes the story and the style are similar. Emma Stone was very believable and charming as the daughter of the protagonist and it was interesting to see Zach Galafanakis take on a more serious role. Naomi Watts put in a very emotionally charged performance and felt very sympathetic towards her character. <br/><br/>I think the play withing the movie did not actually seem particularly good, but that is perhaps intentional because the qualification of the main character's ability to make real ""art"" is held in contention as part of the story. <br/><br/>Anyway, worth seeing if you are okay with something different, and if you are, you may really love this one."

","Being an actor must be one of the most psychologically tasking professions that man has yet created. You're asked to move from skin to skin, from soul to soul, from psychology to psychology, from paying gig to paying gig, and also to traverse the minefield of box office success. If you're successful, you're asked to do this with breakneck rapidity. It's no wonder some actors succumb to mental breakdowns and unhealthy choices.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton understands this better than anyone else. From Night Shift in 1982 to The Dream Team in 1989, he established himself as one of the most likable comedians in the business. Then he was improbably cast in the coveted role of Batman, leading many to regard the news with ""Really? Mr. Mom?"" But the movie would become one the highest grossing and most beloved action movies of all time, and the peak of the Keaton's career. After a less-than-stellar sequel in 1992, he walked away and the remainder of his career hasn't ever reached that peak again, until now.<br/><br/>There is virtually no way that Keaton could brush off comparisons between his own career and that of the character that he plays in Birdman, a once great box office star of a hit superhero franchise who walked away from the series at its height but never really found that level of success again. As moviegoers, we love connectivity – we love seeing actors parallel their lives on the screen. We love to ask ""what if?"" What if Keaton had continued his role as The Caped Crusader under the direction of Joel Schumacher? Would he still be as beloved for the role of Batman if he had continued on? To ask those questions is to wonder if Keaton himself ever considered this. Alas, we shall never know what might have become of the series and that question is what gives a movie like Birdman – or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, a bit of poignancy.<br/><br/>In what may be the comeback role of all time, Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a once great box office superstar who starred in the blockbuster Birdman series 25 years ago but walked away from the series after three films, effectively giving up the fame and the money that went with it. Now, past 60, Riggan is the prime candidate for the ""Where Are They Now?"" files, a washed up actor who feels that he never really reached his potential. Yet, something is pulling him back – he misses the fame and notoriety that went with the role. It doesn't help that he continually hears the sinister, gravelly voice of Birdman in his head reminding him of this at every moment that his brain is idle.<br/><br/>The need to redeem himself and restore his career to a degree of respectability is what is causing Riggan to lose his marbles. In a last ditch effort at respectability, he has staked his reputation and all of his money on writing, directing and starring in a flouncy Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" The pace of Birdman is breathtaking as we watch the backstage preparation for a play that everyone believes is shaping up to be a disaster. Every conceivable disaster is laying on Riggan's shoulders. His daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is now his personal assistant – and a reminder of his lousy parenting skills. There's the issue that Laura, his leading lady (Andrea Riseborough), may be pregnant with his child. Plus, there's the issue of Mike (Edward Norton), the self-involved leading man who is not only bedding one of the other cast members (Noami Watts), but is known to unexpectedly improvise.<br/><br/>What could have been just a boring backstage farce, actually turns out to be one of the most entertaining movies to watch. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu, usually known for dead serious dramas like Babel and 21 Grams takes a lighter touch here, creating a comedy that is funny not is jokes but in situation. We watch Riggan adrift in his own public image, whose most prolific moments have nothing to do with his work, like a video that goes viral after he accidentally locks himself out of his dressing room and ends up in the street in nothing but his underwear.<br/><br/>The pressure is on as the opening night of the play draws closer, and too do the voices in Riggan's head. This is a man who is clearly losing his mind, and we are privy to wonder what parts of his reality are real or just a figment of his feathery imagination. What happens in the film's third act is really dependent upon how you perceive what has become of Riggan as a human being. Is he really losing it, or is he really something of the persona he brought to the screen all those years ago. Whatever is going on, Keaton gives his heart and soul to this performance. It is the Keaton we all know, giving a soaring, fearless performance that reveal new levels of his acting, and remind us of the reasons he became a star in the first place."

","When I first heard about this movie I thought it was gonna actually be a superhero movie but once I saw it I was surprised at how incredibly wonderful it was. It was about a washed up actor who once did superhero movies such as Bird man, Bird man 2, and Bird man 3. Michael Keaton did a terrific job with this role and I think it's because he is a now washed up actor who played superheroes such as Batman, and Batman Returns. But he is beginning to be known for more than just Batman. But what made me incredibly intrigued in this film was the ending when he jumped out of a hospital window and his daughter came into the room and looked out the window and looked up and smiled as if he were flying. Which we had seen earlier in the film when he was having a mental breakdown. I think what that ending was him pretending his daughter saw him flying in his last moments of life. But I can be wrong, it is a possibility that he actually does have the power to fly but I want to think of this movie being logical and not having superpowers. But aside from all of the confusion all of the character interactions were clever and heartfelt and occasionally hilarious. Edward Norton did a great performance again as he pretty much always has. Emma Stone I found was also incredibly talented. This is a must see!"

","""Birdman"" looks to have a good chance of winning the best movie Oscar. It is also an excellent example of what I do not like in a Hollywood movie. One way to explain my dislike is to point out that ""Birdman"" seems to have been created with a check list of those features considered necessary to film a blockbuster. <br/><br/>Superhero? Check. War damage to cities? Check. Emotional tension? Check. Multi-generational points of view? Check. Somewhat unusual camera work and music? Check. Nudity? Check. Indicate that you are on the forefront of Hollywood conventions? Check. This was done by showing male bodies instead of female and by treating sex more subtly than has been the norm for the past generation.<br/><br/>The movie even has some issues that ought to resonate with me: career angst, tensions with ex-wife, and tensions with grown children. <br/><br/>Because there are so many checkboxes, none of the above works. For example, the issues that ought to resonate with me do not because there is not enough background to bring me from my concerns to Birdman's concerns. <br/><br/>There is one subject that is treated in more depth, the tensions between Hollywood and Broadway. If you look for deeper meaning within the movie, this is where you will find it. However even this central theme is stunted by those checkboxes. For all I know, the subject itself was just another checkbox--one aimed at those who vote for the Oscars.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, there is another check box that was ticked off, symbolism. This may be my imagination but all those scenes of characters moving around in narrow corridors seem to reflect what the creators of this movie were doing when working within Hollywood's constraints.<br/><br/>If you want to see a very well conceived and executed attempt to make a Hollywood style movie, then see this movie. Otherwise forget it."
"Jerghal","8","2","6","8 February 2015"," An experience as much as a film
","In Birdman actors play a version of themselves. Keaton plays a washed up ex superhero movie star who wants to gain recognition and respect as an artist and actor by doing a deep Broadway play. Norton plays a self righteous and difficult to work with talented actor (which is the reputation he has in real life). Iñárritu and his DP did a technical tour de force by making the film (appear) as one shot (with the help of the VFX guys no doubt) but that alone makes viewing this film an extraordinary experience. The score consists only of a guy playing drums (you actual see him in the background several times) in different tempos but it works very well - though that makes the score more supporting and less interesting to listen to on it's own (like the score of Interstellar e.g.). This film which was Keaton's first lead role in 6 years will surely put him back on the map in Hollywood. As much as I liked this movie it was not as good as Nightcrawler because of several reasons: the film is a bit long and Gylenhaals performance is more enjoyable then Keaton's so the Oscars can go to Nightcrawler for me. But certainly check it out, it's as much an experience as it is a film!"
"gameplacereviews","10","4","17","3 November 2014"," Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, Starring: Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone.
","This review comes from Filmanalyst.weebly.com<br/><br/>I could applaud Bridman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) for simply it's wild creativity. The way that it's shot, and scripted,and acted is all creative, but that really would be selling the entire thing short. This movie has so many layers, so many things to say,and explore about it's characters that it has to be inherently interesting on it's own. But it does have the creative direction,and cinematography, and scripting,and so much more. Birdman could be the best film of the year if only for the fact that I think the best film ever made came out this year.<br/><br/>Birdman tells the story of Riggan Thompson (Michael Keaton). He is a man who used to play a comic book hero called Birdman,but after years out of the spotlight is not much of a star. But he's trying to get back through a Broadway performance that he's writing,and directing. He will have to deal with stars clashing, and his own deteriorating mental state (There's a voice in his head that is Birdman talking to him) all the way up to the shocking conclusion. But that would only be skimming the surface of the entire thing. Do not expect to enjoy this film by just sitting,and watching it. That's not to say you couldn't it's just there is so much more to it than that. There's the way that the script of the play that Thompson is making especially the final scene describes the emotions felt by the character in real life. The way that time doesn't really change,and there is not cut's between the scenes,and the film just flows into the next part,and the way that the film is scripted in a way that shows,and doesn't tell. This list could go on,and on, and doesn't even begin to describe the depth that is found here. Really that's what I appreciated most about Birdman. The fact that after the film is over,and the funny dialogue,and beautiful imagery has gone away I can sit here,and still think about how it ties together. How I can dig my teeth into it still now,and still get something out of it. <br/><br/>The film is quite odd though,but the cast carries it with as a critic on the play in the film writes ""super realism."" Michael Keaton is a very good actor, and I just didn't know that from watching him prance around in tights. He gives a great performance that fit's the film perfectly,and it's kind of funny how his own career is basically the same as Riggan's. Edward Norton reminds me of why he is one of my favorites in a role as an egotistical actor that is actually really funny. Naomi Watts, and Zach Galifianakis remind us of the great actors they can be. They all mesh perfectly to create a wonderful trip behind the stage. <br/><br/>However if you are a person who wants to see spectacle,and is not a fan of anything weird don't go see this. It's good,but you have to think,and put together,and that might not make this the right experience for you.<br/><br/>Birdman is deliciously complex,and deep. It also has highlight performances,and if you look the way it all ties together is spectacular.I wish it were for more people, but it's not. It's a fantastic film though, and will be on my top 10.<br/><br/>I give Birdman a 10 out of 10."

I love how Inarritu twisted the question ""If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"" in to an existential case study. ""If you are there and no one knows it, do you really exist?"" I loved the balance and the transitions between Riggan and Birdman.

"hovseptouloujian","9","1","2","25 December 2019"," Birdman: The Truths That We Wish We Could Deny
","Birdman, starring Michael Keaton, previously known for playing in one of the best Batman portrayals alongside Joker Jack Nicholson, is a film that gives us, conceptually, a status-quo of the world we live in, addressing what I found myself calling ""the truths that we wish we could deny.""<br/><br/>The plot is centered around a washed-up Hollywood actor, Riggan Thompson, who in his younger days played the role of a masked super-hero by the name of Birdman (notice why Keaton is perfect for the role?), a franchise that found great success in the mainstream audience. After three more than successful highly action-packed films, Thompson decides to retire from the Bird's mask, and to find a career in Broadway playwriting as he writes, directs, and stars in an adaptation of a 1981 book titled ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" Throughout the film, we are exposed to Thompson's struggles in the leap from the mainstream film industry to the more subtle, artistic, and critical stage of Broadway, from the anger of theater critics, the audiences, and Thompson's very own family. The voice of Birdman, which has since grown into his alter-ego comes to him and haunts him in his darkest hours, and for some reason, that ties in with Thompson having telekinetic powers (but I'll let you watch that and interpret it however you like).<br/><br/>The main cast is perfectly fitting, starting with Michael Keaton who draws the similarities between his real-life struggle to leap from Batman to a more realistic actor and Thompson's Birdman. The co-star, in my opinion steals the show, as Edward Norton plays Mike Shiner, a very famous Broadway actor who takes over a role at the very last second of rehearsals. Everything about Norton in this film is wonderful. He carries himself like a God of the Stage, he smiles, talks, walks, and reacts perfectly in every single scene. I couldn't get enough of him. Thompson's unstable daughter, who works as his assistant, Sam, is played by Emma Stone, and Zach Galifianakis, from the Hangover plays Thompson's attorney and best friend. The dynamic in the cast is explosive, especially between Keaton and Norton who I wished just had a film of them acting on a Broadway stage.<br/><br/>The most important aspect of the film, and honestly, what makes it truly memorable, is its cinematic appearance. In one word, I must say it is unorthodox. The film is made to play as one big scene as the camera never shifts from a picture to another and gives us a seemingly first-person view of the backstage region of Broadway. By great editing, long takes, and the incredible talent of the cast, this created a sense of reality and anxiety at every point in the film. Accompanied by the camera work, the film score consisted mostly of jazz drums, which made every single scene incredibly enjoyable. Usually, in most films, a scene is centered around the music that's playing, and the music will then dictate the atmosphere. But in Birdman, the music is not an atmosphere setter; it is a character of its own. It fits into the conversations, and into the scenes. It reminds me of one of my favorite moments in music, when in Kendrick Lamar's ""To Pimp a Butterfly,"" Kendrick is having a conversation with pre-recorded Tupac Shakur interviews, and slowly, but surely, a rambling jazz tune comes waltzing in, interrupting the conversation, until Tupac disappears from the conversation, and we are left with Kendrick, in the heat of a jazz band's rambling, screaming the name ""PAC!"". This is true cinematic art, and Birdman masters it.<br/><br/>I spent a few minutes thinking about some flaws and here are minor ones, without giving too many spoilers: Norton does not appear as much in the final act of the film, the last scene is extremely controversial (maybe even unnecessarily so), and Thompson's telekinetic powers, and their consequences haven't sat well with me. That's maybe all I can think of.<br/><br/>Conclusively, I believe that Birdman's point hits the target, and hits it hard. It will make audiences think about what they really like about cinema and entertainment, about reality and fantasy, and about the ever-growing consumerist culture in the world. This is what makes Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) an essential."
"barisayhan","8","1","2","28 November 2019"," Good but a little overrated.
","The film has a nice tempo and I think it's quite smooth. It is also impossible for a film with Emmanuel Lubezki and Alejandro G. Iñárritu to be visually bad. But when you say ""The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" you think you're going to watch a very philosophical movie. I also find it unnecessary to try to make the film look like a single shot. The long plans of Emmanuel Lubezki's Gravity and Children of Men with Alfonso Cuaron were much more meaningful. Acting is fine. You have to watch it, but not to exaggerate."

","Birdman is a clever film. It is a well made film. It is not Iñárritu's best film. The single-shot film is something so many filmmakers have thought about and tried over the years, but few have been able to successfully do. Birdman is the first to flawlessly pull it off (even though it wasn't truly a single shot). The problem is that gimmick made it more difficult to delve into the characters and story and instead pull attention to itself (the filmmaking) rather than the film. Because there is an interesting story in Birdman and some incredible performances (Keaton in particular), but I found it hard to truly get invested because I kept marveling at the technique."
"Neptune165","4","1","2","20 August 2019"," was highly overrated
","An awful story and boring. I wanted to like Birdman way more than I actually did. I loved the originality, but it had this slightly over-the-top, theatery vibe to it that I really wasn't into. That and the way the camera hardly ever got more than five feet from the actors made it a little exhausting to watch. Birdman. It was very well acted and had some amazing scenes but I couldn't get into it at all minus the scene where Keaton roasts the critic. Not saying the movie is bad by any means technically, just it caters to a particular audience. But I just wasn't excited about this movie at all. I saw the ending coming miles away. At the end of the movie, I just felt tired. Maybe it is because of the camera work. In all sincerity I couldn't relate to any of the characters, they felt alien to me, going on and on on their traumas made me rise my eyebrow and watch the clock. to me all the ""bad"" stuff happening was something I already knew. Nothing new to see. I got bored as hell. Maybe it's a niche under niche movie"
"xx-slay-n-xx","8","1","2","13 August 2019"," The Unexpected Flow of Elegance
","And I did get what I wanted from this film, even so. Having heard of this film and its continuous uncut structure, I remained skeptical, but left pleasantly surprised. Innaritu is able to deliver such a captivating story with twists and turns and progress despite it never feeling like there is a break in the action or a moment to catch your breath. This constant continuity kept me riveted and focused on what was happening, always curious to see that next ""scene"". In a way, this unbroken stream also creates an anxiety that allows the audience to really get inside Riggan's mind and feel what he is feeling. There is no time to pause and reflect before the next piece of dialogue or the next preview of the play, and so the audience is constantly holding their breath and waiting to see what will happen.<br/><br/>The music score cannot be understated enough. Never did I expect that so much could be done with so little. The drums never stopped or faded entirely, only took a backseat during the dialogue and then thundered back in when needed. Their constant beating underscored the flow of time as it continuously marches forward. The way that it flows in and out of the actual scenes in the movie is beautifully done, as we always wonder where the drums are coming from. Are they around the corner on the street? Or are they all in my head? The classical music used to accentuate Riggan's hallucinations were wonderfully timed and jarring in their abruptness.<br/><br/>This film won't be accessible for everyone. It is laced with ambiguity and caters to an artistic film audience. The meta-narrative of film critique and the industry may be lost of some people, but that doesn't stop the film from having a strong emotional impact on nearly everyone. With the end of the film, you will be left to wonder and speculate on your own, as any great film should make you do. Birdman captures something so uniquely human and yet so foreign and fantastical that everyone needs to see it first hand to experience this feeling."

"Carrzinho","8","1","2","2 August 2019"," A major technical achievement.
","Birdman (2014)
Post middle age Riggan (Michael Keaton) twenty years past his peak movie career as action hero Birdman, is making his Broadway debut. He is directing and staring in his own adaption of a Raymond Carver story. He has gambled his life savings and his soul/sanity in an homage to Carver and a chance to make his career relevant once again and worthy as a whole.
The acting is sublime from Keaton, (daughter) Emma Stone, (fellow stage actors) Naomi Watts and a top draw Edward Norton.
They are helped by the direction that gives the perception of a movie recorded in a single take with very long scenes and non obvious cuts, though in most cases ""time"" has clearly elapsed.
70% of the soundtrack is a mostly wonderful jazz drum solo (there were a couple of minutes I fell out of love with it before I confirmed) that (it) mirrors the clutter of Riggans mind (though not exclusively) heightening the crescendo of certain scenes. It really is a technical tour de force.
So what's not to like? Well not much. The story is captivating, it's well structured and there's a fascinating ambiguity to Riggan (and that's with mentioning his ""other"" internal voice).
One can't help admitting it's more than a little self indulgent, though never pretentious. The story isn't wholly coherent but gets most of the way there.
It is incredibly endearing though. It's constantly funny though more dark and dry than lols. The final frames are over engineered but cute enough to confirm time well spent.
Perhaps not enough to reach the highest highs but there's so much to enjoy here. EIGHT"

"KieranSaosila","10","1","2","15 July 2019"," Masterpiece storytelling.
","Birdman or (the unexpected virtue of ignorance) is directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu and follows Riggan Thomson through his somewhat descending career as an actor, all-while losing touch with reality itself. A film of masterful work.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton kills it in this role of a man who is plagued by the shadow of his former superhero role, Birdman. With very little success since the superhero franchise concluded, we see Riggan face the struggle of not feeling relevance anymore as an actor in the industry. This is front and centre within the film. Riggan's need to feel relevant taking a constant toll on him throughout the story is a gripping journey, that is not only thoroughly entertaining, but provides an insight into the psyche of actors and actresses who fail to escape that one role that made them famous.<br/><br/>The story takes time to explore the flawed personalities of not only Riggan Thomson, but supporting characters also, mainly being Emma Stone, Edward Norton and Naomi Watts, who were all the best I've ever seen of them on film. Even Zach Galifianakis was great. Every character was engaging and there was some really great chemistry here, especially between Michael Keaton and Edward Norton.<br/><br/>Though the film mostly remains within the same location for the duration of the story, it never fails to look great in terms of lighting and colour. It's a very pleasing film to watch. It was also filmed and edited in a way to make it seem like it was mostly filmed in one take, which I found refreshing to watch as one continuous journey as opposed to a distinguishable three act structure. Aiding the film was it's very fitting drum score composed of mainly jazz beats, which I found as kind of a 'icing on the cake' detail which really made the film pop out.<br/><br/>The film deals with thought provoking themes like family reconciliation and severe mental health, though despite being a black comedy, the story never has issues cross cutting between its humorous and more serious notes. One of the greatest qualities of Birdman is the idea of a persons subjective reality, which interweaves with Riggan Tomson's mid-life crisis. This results in many scenes that are left open to interpretation of the audience, giving the film an edge that hooked me from the opening scene.<br/><br/>Birdman or (the unexpected virtue of ignorance) develops complex characters in little time, only made greater by a powerful cast, with Michael Keaton leading the show. Difficult themes are tackled yet enjoyable, again thanks to a great cast, writing and directing. Subjective reality is taken to a new level in this masterpiece of a film."

","Alejandro Iñárritu's black comedy drama about a faded movie star's struggle to stay relevant by adapting a short story on Broadway is a beautiful masterpiece.<br/><br/>Micheal Keaton's performance as the insecure Hollywood star Riggan Thompson is absolutely funny, and great. Apart from that, there's also great performances delivered by Ed Norton, Emma Stone.<br/><br/>The screenplay - with realistic dialogues, and humorous encounters really makes it an unique aspect of the film.<br/><br/>Another important aspect, apart from the direction and performances, is the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, who tries to make the whole film look rather like an experience by his method of long takes. And the editing is also superb- the stitching of the frames were perfect, combined with the drummed soundtrack- top-notch!<br/><br/>Summing it all up- Birdman is a movie, more likely the masterpiece of Iñárritu, and should be a definite watch to any movie buff."
"garyprosser1","9","1","2","11 July 2019"," So clever, so different, so brilliant.
","Finally got around to watching Birdman, not really knowing what to expect. From the synopsis, I wondered if this would be a superhero film in the Marvel/DC vein and those films, despite their huge audiences and rave reviews, just aren't my thing at all. I took a chance though and what I found was a film that is very good and a piece of cinema that is utterly brilliant.<br/><br/>Alejandro Inarritu had made some fantastic films prior to Birdman (including Babel and Amores Perros). He would then follow it up with The Revenant, a film that earned a first Oscar for Leo DiCaprio as well as Best Picture and Best Director for Inarritu. That made it two Best Director Oscars in a row for him because he won the same award for Birdman and upon watching it, it is easy to see why.<br/><br/>The film itself, as I say, is very good. Michael Keaton stars as Riggan Thomson, a somewhat washed up movie star who is writing, directing and putting on a play on Broadway. The play is beset with the kind of problems that probably affect a great many plays and all the while, Thomson's personal life is falling apart and there's the ongoing memory of the career he had that haunts him, not least by the voice (and appearance of his Birdman character and by the imagined superpowers that he once pretended to have.<br/><br/>His urge is to make real art, rather than succumb to the wishes of his agent, rekindle his superhero role (Birdman) and take the easy money. This has to be a bit of a dig at Hollywood's propensity to take less risks than it used to. Why gamble on something original and different when you can just churn out another blockbuster, sell a ton of merchandise and make another $2bn, regardless of whether or not that latest franchise piece is even any good?<br/><br/>The name, the characters and the actors will ensure that it's a box office sensation before anyone has even seen it because it conforms to a tried and trusted template. Riggan could be a part of that again but no, he wants to make art and in doing so, he risks losing absolutely everything.<br/><br/>Keaton is utterly fantastic but he's not alone. Every actor in this film is at the top of his or her game and they are working so hard and here's why: when I say that it's a very good film but a brilliant piece of cinema, perhaps I should explain what I mean.<br/><br/>It occurred to me early on and once it had, I was engrossed. Remember the single shot camerawork in Fight Club? Where the camera flies through a keyhole, swoops across the sky, through a window, down the barrel of a gun and into Edward Norton's mouth? David Fincher, Fight Club's director, also used this technique in Panic Room and Hitchcock was doing it in the 60's. Well, in Birdman, that same technique lasts for an hour and 45 minutes. We don't see a jump cut until the final 15 minutes of the film. The planning and direction, as well as the acting, that must go into composing such scenes and shots is only worthy of, well, the Best Director Oscar.<br/><br/>Seriously, I'm not an expert, but imagine this. An unbroken scene, moving from room to room, unfolding in real time over as much as twenty minutes or more. As the scene progresses, everyone must be in position, ready to deliver their lines, knowing that if they get it wrong or screw up, the last ten, fifteen, twenty minutes has been for nothing and they must all go again. They can't say ""we'll cut it there and go from that last line"" because the whole scene is in one unbroken take and therefore, the whole scene must be done again.<br/><br/>Apart from the aforementioned sequence of jump cuts near the end (which portrays a dream sequence), the whole film is one unbroken camera shot. Even when time is moved forward to present a new scene, clever editing or time lapse is used and the camera doesn't move. There are no cutaways, cuts, fades, dissolves, screen cards or blackouts. The actors have to learn and remember huge tracts of script and get it right first time. Just like a play. Technically, this must be incredibly difficult because Birdman is a film about a play, acted like a play but shot like a film.<br/><br/>Everyone here deserves full marks. The cast (Keaton, Emma Stone, the aforementioned Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Zack Galifianakis, everyone else), the crew (Emmanuel Lubezki also won an Oscar for Best Cinematography) and of course, the Director because Birdman is a compete triumph and an engrossing watch.<br/><br/>Inarritu himself described the idea of a full, single shot film as ""almost suicidal"" whilst remarking that he went with the idea because ""we live our lives without editing"" and that's what he wanted to convey. Boy, he really did too.<br/><br/>Birdman is an extraordinary film and one that I'd happily watch again and again. You should too.<br/><br/>9/10."
"rooprect","9","1","2","7 July 2019"," All in one shot
","Birdman's cinematic gimmick is that the entire movie is seemingly shot in one continuous camera take, no cuts, no edits. In the tradition of the masterpieces ""Russian Ark"", ""PVC-1"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rope"" (which actually had 9 or 10 necessary cuts, due to the limitations of film cameras), likewise here we watch a story seemingly in real-time as if we were invisible observers orbiting the drama. The art of the ""long take"" is a risky gamble because it involves a lot of extra choreography, production, lighting and attention to detail, and most viewers hardly notice. But it's one of the most impressive things that can be done with a camera.<br/><br/>Note: the entire film wasn't actually done in 1 take like the aforementioned movies, but through the use of tasteful cgi edits it's close enough.<br/><br/>If that little introductory factoid bored you, then you'll probably be bored by the flick. Yes, this is an ""artsy"" film, but it doesn't lose itself in artsiness like, say, one of those movies that force you to read subtitles (/sarcasm). Through the use of quirky humor, an interesting story, and of course Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of a complex lovable loser, there's enough to keep your attention as long as you're not expecting an action flick.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" is about an aging moviestar named Riggan who once played an iconic superhero named Birdman, but now having matured, he is intent on leaving the world a legacy of more than pop culture in tights. He self-produces a stage play, investing his entire fortune, as well as the greater part of his sanity, in it, hoping that the insane actors he hired don't destroy his entire vision.<br/><br/>Oh by the way, Riggan may have a few super powers.<br/><br/>The plot itself is a mouthful, but the power of this film lies not in the plot but in the tense human drama that unfolds as we explore themes of dysfunctional family relationships (particularly with his Meh-lennial daughter, excellently played by Emma Stone), arrogance in the art world, and of course the tragedy of not being taken seriously just because you wore blue tights for half your career.<br/><br/>The gimmick of the continuous camera as well as excellent overall cinematography and staging, is the icing on the cake. I can see how Birdman easily swooped up the Academy Award for cinematography in 2017 (along with Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay).<br/><br/>I can also understand why some people hated this movie. It's not an easily digestible entertainment flick, and it is NOT a superhero movie despite it featuring ex-Batman himself in the role of ""Birdman"", so don't expect fight scenes and flying (well not too much flying. And the fight scene was a riot). If you enjoy heavy dramatic works where not a lot happens, yet we are given a peek into the deepest recesses of the human soul (Streetcar Named Desire, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, or any classic stage-to-film adaptation), then this will be right up your alley.<br/><br/>I would compare Birdman to films like ""De-Lovely"" (a stylish biopic of Cole Porter), ""Klimt"" (featuring John Malkovich as the famous Austrian painter), or on the lighter side, a great dysfunctional-superhero gem called ""Special"" with Michael Rapaport playing the role of a lonely metermaid who suddenly develops super powers but still can't get his life together.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" definitely soars above the flock of common Hollywood flicks. If you're not sure, I think you should go ahead and wing it. Just be aware that Birdman isn't exactly a crowd pleaser. Er... crow pleaser? Either way I think you'll beak content with time well spent. Ok, I'll stop now."
"selinuyarlar","8","1","2","29 March 2019"," ...A thing is a thing, not what is said about that thing.
","Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is in the strictest sense of the word a surreal and metaphorical movie. Although the movie is captivating, compelling and interesting; it also certainly pops up questions in the minds of the audience. Throughout the movie we see the brilliant performance of Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson, while he struggles with the voice of a character that he played in the 90s, in his head. The voice of Birdman represents his indecisive personality, search for character, dilemma between realities and desire for acceptance.
Additionally, in various scenes we see Riggan using his powers such as flying, telekinesis etc., which also puts his delusional mind forward and shows the audience a side of Riggan when he lets Birdman overcome his desires. Although there are many controversies that points out that his powers might actually be real; the scene where he flies across New York, lands in front of his theatre and walks inside, we see that he is chased by an angry cabbie who demands money for driving him, indicating that the entire scene was a delusion. Meaning that the voice inside him, Birdman, demonstrates the importance of financial success, whereas Riggan himself believes that acceptance of people and proving himself critically is important.
Moving on to the last scene, no one can say whether he died, or he is still alive and knowing this wouldn't chance the main message of the movie. From the very beginning of the movie Riggan wanted to be loved and accepted; therefore, the people of New York lighting candles for him, praying in the streets, the top critic praising his work and most importantly his daughter finally being close to him shows that his life goal was fulfilled. This might be real, fake, dream, or whatever else...but still doesn't change the fact that he is happy, whether he or us can tell if it is the reality or not.
...A thing is a thing, not what is said about that thing."

The dialogue is so aware of itself to the point that you feel that you are drawn into the character's world (in my view at least).<br/><br/>As a 20 year old, who cannot come to terms with my own mortality, the excange of words between Stone and Norton (where they first meet on the ""roof"" still haunts me. The two are (of course) very different places in their lives, and while playing 'Truth or Dare', Stone dares Norton to tell her what he would do to her. Norton replies, that he would take out her eyes and replace his own eyes with hers so that he could see the street the same way she did at her age.<br/><br/>Haunting, beautiful and sentimental."

"tabuno","10","1","2","15 January 2019"," A Smoothly Divine Shot
","2 January 2015. Michael Keaton plays Riggan, a former superhero on the big screen who made millions and still recognized by aging fans, seeking a comeback with his production of a Broadway play. With an innovative experimental use of a seemingly continuous camera shoot, Birdman offers a first person viewpoint of the behind the scene lives of selected leading characters during several preview productions leading towards the plays premiere. Birdman incorporates at a less surrealistic intensity and plot characterization echoes of Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985) as well as suggestive comparisons to Ben Stiller's Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) and allusions to Kevin Spacey's K-Pax (2001), Robin William's The Fisher King (1991) and Pierce Brosnan's dark assassin comedy The Matador (2005). While it's impossible to determine the extent of Birdman's appeal being derived from this fresh use of the wandering camera or the fantastical imagery, only time will tell. Like the surprisingly stark set design of Dogville (2003) or Jim Carey's schizophrenic experiences in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Birdman brings its own unique style to film. The ultimate initial outcome however, is a breathtaking, immersion into a world of petty human flaws, almost humorous foibles of human nature, and of raw sensual, intimately personal experiences.<br/><br/>Birdman comes off like a serious version of the purely physical comedy of Noises Off (1992) starring Michael Caine and Carol Burnett. Birdman approaches its subject matter in a playfully untraditional manner that avoids the more traditional docu-dramatic or documentary presentations of Mickey Rouke's Best Actor Oscar nomination in The Wrestler (2008) or Neve Campbell's ballerina performance in The Company (2003), Kate Hudson's Best Supporting Oscar in Almost Famous (2000), or Natalie Portman's Oscar winning psychological thriller as a dancer in Black Swan (2010) but still retaining and projecting a sharp vividness of experience, projecting the viewer and immersing them into the film itself.<br/><br/>In brief, Michael Keeton offers the audience a more appealing and oddly enough a more strangely real Lester Burnham character played by Oscar-winning Kevin Spacy in American Beauty (1999) by offering an even broader and more interwoven context of the human experience."

","Birdman is without a doubt one of my favorite films of all time. Everything from the directing to the casting is meticulously crafted to create one of the most compelling films I've ever watched. That being said, the film is by no means a superhero film. I feel that most people dislike this film because people expected it to be a superhero film. To oversimplify, the film is basically a character study of Riggan Thomson (played by Michael Keaton), a washed up actor trying to jumpstart his career by creating a broadway play. Along the way, we're treated with cinematography that presents the film as if it's one take, characters that are expertly acted by legends like Edward Norton, and a satirical message about Hollywood's fixation on the superhero genre that doesn't come across as too preachy or pretentious. Overall, Alejandro González Iñárritu crafted one of my favorite films of all time and while it may not be for everyone, it certainly left a great impression on me."

","I have to say I was really looking forward to this movie. Honestly, if you're a big fan of Emmanuel Lubezki, you'll appreciate this movie. But, I'm going to be honest. The two big stars are Michael Keaton and Edward Norton. I kind of found myself more engaged with Norton. Even though Keaton did a fantastic job, I found myself focusing on Norton because it's satirizing his own behavior. Alejandro does a great job with the movie. However, and I really like you, but I found myself lost at times. It's strange how they added in Riggan having telekinesis. Where did that come from? I also wish they would've added more detail as to why Riggan and Sam have an estranged relationship. The writing could be more thought through if the writers put more detail into some sections. Maybe I should watch it again since the first time around is for the entertainment value."

","The film is a rich complex piece of cinematography. It is not a 'movie' but a piece of cinema which satirises 'movies'. It deals with multiple concepts through its diverse array of characters, which I hope allows for everyone to leave with something at the closing credits. For me it has mostly helped me have a better understanding of the manifestation of mental illness, but for others it may open their eyes to the shallow nature of our technocratic age or the consequences of the human ego.<br/><br/>This genius piece of cinema is something to be truly respected. As we now respect works of Shakespeare or Chaucer, we should respect this film In the same way. I believe this because of the similarities between both pieces of art, Shakespeares work holds such fascination due to its philosophical qualities but also the limitless interpretations that can arise from his work and this is also true of Birdman. Therefore the film is something to be admired, thought about and analysed, it is not to be consumed simply as a 'movie'."

","I watched this film with no expectations for the first time last night- and I now think it is one of the best films of all time. ""Birdman, or (the unexpected virtue of ignorance)"" is a 2014 film starring Michael Keaton. For its majority, it is a one shot movie, and they did a wonderful job making this method work. Every shot in the movie had amazing cinematography and the whole thing was extremely visually pleasing. I have often noticed that when filmmakers try to do long shots (like the ones in this movie), it ends up making me dizzy or confused, but in Birdman it did not do this, it actually made me more immersed and feeling more involved with the story. Every character in the plot was used just the right amount- I got to learn enough about each of them to satisfy me, and every character had great chemistry for the rest of the cast. Edward Norton's supporting role, I thought, was easily the best of this movie. Throughout the film, I felt very helpless towards the struggles of the characters, and I really felt like I was dealing with the same problems as they did. A very small problem I had was that in the scene when Michael Keaton's character flys around the city, the VFX weren't great, I though they could have been better. In the end, the movie had a ending that took me by surprise 3 different times in the final 10 minutes- but was very satisfying."

Almost every aspect of this film is tremendous. The acting is stellar, the simplistic score works great with the movie, the direction and cinematography is fantastic, and the story is interesting and thought provoking. The dark humor in the movie is great as well, and makes sure to emphasize that this movie is in fact a satirical look at Hollywood. Lastly, the writing for this movie is phenomenal, making the story incredibly interesting and creating terrific character development.<br/><br/>Addressing thoughts that the film is too ""artistic,"" for people, I will say this. I personally hate artsy films, but I never thought of this movie as overly artistic. I felt everything worked well within it. As long as you understand that this is a satirical work, you will gain more enjoyment out of it. Part of enjoying film is analyzing, and looking deeper at the art in order to gain something from it. I challenge you to look at it from analytical eyes as you will enjoy it much more than if you do not. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film that I recommend all movie fans watch. It has a strong message and great writing which separates it from most films. This only gets a 9 out of 10 due to the fact that it doesn't compare to the likes of ""The Godfather.""

","You can't use the phrase ""perfect"" for anything you only love, or that is good, or very good. It has to be all set together very smoothly and just in the right way.<br/><br/>In these terms, I call Birdman THE perfect movie. It's a flawless movie that Alejandro G. Iñárritu put it's pieces in the right place. <br/><br/>Where to begin? The story and the writing? The story is a well structured story that combines realism with surrealism in the only place they can be together: backstage of Broadway Theatre. The story talks about love, hate, family, courage, fame - how to handle the lost of it-, life and death. The characters are so well written that everybody can see something in common with Riggan. The climax of the movie from the scene when the critic promised Riggan that she will destroy his play to the flying scene is the most powerful climax I ever saw in a movie. The building for that moment from the beginning of the movie was right and delivered it the right way.<br/><br/>The directing, cinematography and editing? Well, here comes the good part. With his single shot techniques, Alejandro G. Iñárritu drew his own moving Mona Lisa.I felt I'm with them in that backstage getting ready for my turn.<br/><br/>The acting was beyond description.Michael Keaton did his best performance ever, Edward Norton and Emma Stone were amazing. Zach Galifianakis was just perfect. <br/><br/>The Music was the glue that hold it all together, drums, just the drums, that made every second of the movie clear of boredom.<br/><br/>The movie is about respecting art and film making.

"Edd-N-Furter","9","1","2","17 February 2018"," Birdman or the totally unexpected virtue of failed superheroes
","Riggan Thomson is an actor whose glory years are now in the past; in an attempt to regain the acclaim and leave behind the shadow of Birdman (the superhero that launched him to fame 20 years ago), he ventures to make a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, acted, directed and produced by himself. Just before the preview performances one of the players is injured, forcing the production to find a replacement, which comes in the skin of Mike Shiner, a brilliant but highly conflictive actor, due to his excessive commitment to the acting method. However, Mike is just one of the many issues Riggan must deal with before the opening night: his daughter Sam, fresh out of rehab and who's working as his assistant; Laura, her scene partner with whom is having an affair; a potential claim by the injured player; the pressure that brings the Times critic Tabitha Dickinson, who has the necessary influence to ensure the success or failure of the play, and finally is the voice in his head which manifests as Birdman and that makes him fantasize (or go delirious?) about his time of splendor.<br/><br/>In his fifth feature film, director Alejandro González Iñárritu takes a radical turn to his narrative style and bets for the black comedy and satire. This change turns out to be perfect, as he moves away from the stories infested of tragedy and suffering closer to what is known as ""misery porn"", and while they worked in the past for him, in his previous work Biutiful already showed that this formula was wearing out quickly. But he does not abandons them totally, since in Birdman explores the emotional misery of a man looking for a new opportunity to prove he is not finished and so redeem his failures as a father, husband and even as actor and how this search can cost him his sanity, all this with a very corrosive humor. Not coincidentally, Iñárritu has chosen the work of Raymond Carver, since it works as an irony about what love means for each of the characters: for Sam, the lack of it throughout his life; for Mike the love that borders on insane vanity and blinds him to the perception of others towards him and Riggan himself, looking for love in the form of success and lost admiration. At the same time Iñárritu with his co-writers throw a subtle but accurate critique of current Hollywood production system, concerned about over-exploiting movie sub-genres like the superheroes one and make endless franchises for the sole purpose of generating profits and how the same industry relegates and denies opportunities for older actors who are forced in many cases to create their own opportunities in order to stay relevant. On the other hand, it has no mercy with critics and how their work can turn into pure snobbery and some of them forget the sense of objective criticism and move it to the personal level.<br/><br/>Iñarritu has managed to polish his skills as a director and this time assumes a big risk by taking them to the limit, knowing that the result could have been disastrous. However, what he achieves is a hypnotic and captivating work. This with the help of a great technical team led by Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, who continues to surpass himself, editors Stephen Mirrione and Douglas Crise, who executed perfectly the idea that the viewer is watching a long tracking shot and drummer Antonio Sanchez, who created based on jazz rhythms an energetic and disturbing score at the same time.<br/><br/>However, Iñarritu's best ability is the one that shines the most in this movie, and that's the capacity to create empathy with his actors so they can give the best of themselves and achieve unforgettable performances. This skill has been a constant since his film debut Amores perros and in Birdman takes advantage of a virtuoso cast with Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan in small but juicy roles, Emma Stone as Sam, Edward Norton who find in Mike his best performance in years. But certainly Michael Keaton is the soul, heart and brain of Birdman, at this point is difficult to conceive the film without his extraordinary performance as Riggan with all its nuances, from his emotional vulnerability caused by the fear of failure to his anger caused by his frustration.<br/><br/>This is how Birdman stands as one of the best films of 2014 and confirms Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu as one of the most daring and original voices in current cinema."

","This movie is unorthodox in so many ways, but it works so brilliantly. From the random drum beats in the credits to the levitation and telekinesis, you will be confused and entertained. The writing/dialogue is excellent, accompanied by awesome performances by Michael Keaton (the original Batman), Ed Norton and the others. Also, if you had any questions about the title, watch the movie and you'll understand. <br/><br/>Keaton plays a sort of veteran actor in a world full of real celebrities (Clooney, Renner, etc.) where he is desperate to get his career back on track by performing in a play involving love and cheating and the like. He is haunted by the inner voice of his past self (as Birdman), who insults and enrages him on multiple occasions. This inner voice, even though Riggan (Keaton's character) hates it, motivates him to get up from his low points in the film (e.g. sleeping on some stairs using a plastic bag as a pillow after drinking a pint of whiskey). The voice also makes him hallucinate about returning to Birdman (you'll see what happens). Keaton also puts conviction into these frustrated moments, whether it's towards life or someone else (like Norton's character, Mike or Tabitha, a reviewer, whom he hates). He portrays the struggling actor very well (earning him a Golden Globe win and Oscar nomination, both deserved) with enough raw emotion to be realistic, but not melodramatic. <br/><br/>Norton (how this man has not won an Oscar in his career is insane) also fits his role as Mike amazingly - an egomaniac who doesn't want anyone to control him. He does and says so many weird and out-of-the-blue things, but they add to the character, showing you why the other cast members hate him. Granted, Mike is a good actor, but he's uncontrollable. He gets beaten up by Riggan for stealing a spot in the NYT, where Riggan convincingly proves his acting ability. Mike also teaches Riggan about some parts of life (like Riggan's internal voice) and almost embodies cynicism. Emma Stone (Best Supporting Actress nomination for this, which is fair) also works unexpectedly (given she typically plays friendly characters) well as his estranged, drug-addicted daughter who, like Mike, lashes out at Riggan about him being a poor father and how low she believes his life currently is. <br/><br/>The camera work is also very crafty, appropriately using slow transitions and rapid swings, mainly between characters. Riggan flying and moving stuff around with his mind is fun to watch. It was great to see Zach Galifianakis get away from his usual light comedic roles and, like the others, swear, be angry and uptight as Riggan's mate and produce. Also, low budget. Yes. <br/><br/>I really cannot think of anything to call poor; I just think that some may not like its unorthodox nature."
"gianfra-06676","10","1","2","21 November 2017"," One long and technically marvelous take to show us a man's path to redemption, while adding satiric and black comedy elements
","A man searching for success and meaning when youth, wealth and fame have already turned his back on him, and the fact that he's had a pretty messy life (a divorce, a daughter whom he has always ignored and neglected, and is now dealing with drug addiction and overall unhappiness) doesn't help his situation. But he, Riggan Thomson, the once renowned Birdman, looks for a way to redeem himself from the failures of his past, and to get rid of the voice in his head (Birdman himself, taunting Riggan from the depths of his subconscious, messing with his sanity) by adapting Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" into a Broadway play, on which he is putting heart and soul to get right, facing unstable actors, his own deteriorating sanity and poor relationship with those around him, and a vile critic determined to ruin his name by slandering him and his play. All this shown through one (of course heavily edited and composited but nonetheless very convincing) long take, that acts both as an astounding technical achievement and a way to showcase the vertigo and overall feeling of movement and momentum that the story has, while making the story as grounded and realistic as possible, because life itself is one continuous long take that does not stop until you die (like our main protagonist, but it's entirely up to you if that's true or not).<br/><br/>Why be happy with being a philistine when you can enjoy ""artsy fartsy"" movies without being a complete snob? Oh, that's right, because I revel in my ignorance, and any movie that takes me out of that comfort zone is ""pretentious"", ""self indulgent"" and ""artsy fartsy"", and I wouldn't touch that stuff with a ten foot pole, because I love being rewarded and hate having my expectations be subverted. Or at least that's what I heard some critics say over here. Even bratty children make temper tantrums less annoying than the ""criticism"" that I've heard for this film. Forget the beautiful and elaborate cinematography (people take everything for granted these days and don't think about the effort and passion that went into it, or how it complements the story, just ""muh motion sickness""), the time this film takes to develop characters and the overall plot (""because my friend fell asleep watching this"", hate to break it to you, but just because some people aren't able to appreciate pacing and character development, doesn't mean it isn't there), or the underlying themes and what it has to say about the industry (be it film, theatre, or any other art form for that matter). Just discard it, because regular people feel attacked or somehow poked fun at. Guess what, self proclaimed ""philistines"": Facts don't care about your feelings. And this is a superbly made, directed, acted, shot, written and thought out film. That's a fact. You can whine or screech in mediocre confusion all you want, or call it ""artsy fartsy"" (instead of trying to appreciate what you're seeing), but it won't change the fact that this is a revolutionary film that will go down as one of the greatest of moving picture history. And I don't even care if it already won Oscars or not, because a film can be revolutionary and influential without being recognized by ""the academy"", and both cinematographer and director (Luzbeki and Iñarritu) have had very influential and groundbreaking work (Children of Men on Luzbeki's part, and Babel on Iñarritu's, although the latter was nominated, but lost to Scorsese's The Departed, which was another great piece of cinema, and Scorsese was coincidentally another superb filmmaker not recognized by the academy up until that point) that has been overlooked or not received the praise it really deserves."

","Birdman is unlike any movie I've ever seen before and that's the highest praise I could give a movie and is one of the reasons I love it so much. One thing I loved about this film was the way it was directed, I've always loved watching long, on stake shots but expanding it out across an entire movie is something that never crossed my mind and I loved it, it just gave this film a flow that allowed it to be perfectly paced and is possibly one of the best directed movies I've ever seen. The way this film views the modern film industry is fantastic, it's not done in an insulting way but in a way that allows the viewer to think upon other big blockbusters. Michael Keaton is amazing in this movie, I've always liked him as an actor but he's never really blown me away until this film, he was able to draw from his own life experience to add to his performance and is overall just a unique performance. You really felt for his character you understood why it was so important for this play to work out for him. Edward Norton is one of my favourite actors and this is easily one of his best performances, not only does he succeed at being a scumbag but he's also able to bring a humanity to his character that makes him more compelling, like Keaton you understand completely why he is the way he is. Emma Stone has really grown on me in recent year but I've never seen her like this, it's a completely disgusting character but it's not needless, you understand her past experiences and why she is the way she is, Stones now famous monologue in this film blew me away, my jaw was on the floor and eyes were glued to the screen. This movie is very interpretative and I liked that about this film. You don't completely understand what is going on and the choice of leaving an open ending really made me want to go back and watch it again to try and form your own theories and understand better. This film also does great things with its characters, the reason all the performances Birdman are so good is because there all developed perfectly, they all have great backstories and reasons for their attitudes. <br/><br/>To be honest I don't really have any flaws with this movie, I can't explain it but I just can give this film a 10. But it doesn't change the fact that I love this film. I admired how it tried to be different, I loved all the character and performances. It perfectly and paced and directed and I believe that this is one of those films that everybody, film fan or not, should experience at least once in their lifetime. <br/><br/>91%/A"

The acting is disgusting, I felt like I as being sexually harassed by hughmungus. It was like I was watching the good dinosaur. I read that they use this movie as a very successful interrogation/torture method! There has been a lot of controversy around this because it is pretty gross for the interrogator amid all the barf, tears, screams coming from the prisoner.

","I happened to catch BIRDMAN just a bit ago, for those of you who don't know about it or even for those who just saw the trailer and were still a little confused, Birdman is an art-house flick written and directed by one of the new heavies of Hollywood Alejandro González Iñárritu, of 21 Grams, Babble and Biutiful fame. The movie stars Michael Keaton as an aging actor living in the shadow of his past glories and his attempts to reignite his career with a Broadway play that he believes will help him prove to himself and the world that he's not just another flash in the pan Hollywood star.<br/><br/>It's kind of hard to know where to start with this movie because there is a lot going on in it and all of it is noteworthy. For starters, the story is really interesting as it seems to be written SPECIFICALLY for Michael Keaton about his experience since playing the famous caped crusader from Gotham City. The movie plays in a very art-house cinema sort of way incorporating sharp dialog with surreal visual elements that keep your mind working to figure out how the show is going to play out. This experience is fueled by performances by Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts (all of which have been in comic book movies... Yes, even Naomi Watts, remember Tank Girl? You don't? Well I guess it's just the same because it wasn't very good anyway) as well as a startlingly good performance by Zach Galifinakis! It's really interesting following Keaton and the cast throughout this film and the semi-surreal nature of it really keeps you glued to your seat and wondering what is going to happen next. Will Keaton grow wings or will he buy a pack of gum? Who knows?! And that's really the appeal of this film. It's a kind of original film making that hasn't been seen on a big screen since the late 1970s which is really refreshing.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and it is sure to garner a few golden statue nominations including Best Original Screenplay and maybe a Best Actor nomination for Keaton and honestly, it would be well deserved. If you do see this movie, here is a tip, don't let the trailer trick you into thinking it's a artsy superhero movie, IT TOTALLY ISN'T but don't let that dissuade you from going to check it out because It's in my top 10 this year. Birdman gets a 4.5...out of 5."

Bathed in sunlight streaming in from an open window, he looks peaceful.

","Before I give my review, I'd like to explain some of the hate this film has been getting. Many people hated this film because they thought it was boring and artsy. Some people went into this film thinking it would be a superhero films (which it is not what so ever). If you go into this film thinking it's anything other than what it really is, chances are you'll hate it. Birdman is a drama, and it could be a satirical comedy if you are a movie or theater buff. It follows a man trying to revive his career as an actor into becoming a play director and actor played by Michael Keaton. Michael brings in the best performance of his career, as well as Emma Stone, who plays his Daughter. Edward Norton, who plays a theater actor also gives an excellent performance. This movie can do everything a movie is supposed to do. And it might sound cliché but you can laugh, cry, feel good, and learn something new. The film is put together to look like it was all filmed in one shot. This makes sense seeing as the film is about a theater production and Theater has not cuts or editing. But this film isn't only about a theater production, this is a film about critics, movies, superhero movies, actors and actresses, life. This is essentially a movie about everything, the ultimate movie. Birdman has excellent performances, a great story, amazing camera-work, and legendary direction from Alejandro Gonzalez Iñaritu and this one is totally deserving of it's 9/10"
"chaos-rampant","Null","1","2","10 September 2015"," Sankara, or inner city jazz
","Hollywood just loves views of itself; and when coupled with aging actors having to cope with fame in histrionic performance and some obvious wizardry in the camera it gets everyone up from their seats to festoon with awards. That's fine. Funny however, Welles was once upon time ostracized for much the same thing in Kane.<br/><br/>But that's half the story. The other half is that this is much more cinematic and layered than several winners of late. I like this. Whereas Argo and King's Speech were competent at best, this aspires to mastery. To go deep into the stuff that keep us awake.<br/><br/>This is about one such man kept awake at nights by where he fits in the narratives of life, rendered as an aging actor wandering in and out of a performance he struggles to bring to life over the course of a few days, one that caps off a lifetime and leaves behind something worth recalling. The place is a theater but more broadly the stage of dreams.<br/><br/>This layer of the film yields the obvious; satire about the business of having to live with and up to an image, Caine playing himself as the man who used to be Batman, snarling and throwing things. Some more commentary about the mechanisms that control a fickle culture; the journalist who controls the fate of a show by what story she writes, people stuck with the familiar image in mind (Batman).<br/><br/>That's all readily available, simple essaying. There's something more important to glean further inside however, more deeply about our place in the midst of images. <br/><br/>We're all actors like him (or so we think), going out on stage every day to wring truth out of role. We're all like him constantly wading through inner narratives we sustain around us, with desires and aversions that summon things to us or push them back. (Mental formations)<br/><br/>(Now we see the difference with films like Batman and others, that show us a flawed hero who crisply walks through some dramatic arc. Oh he may look pained or confused in spots, but the overarching gaze is always solid, we're in full control as viewers. In actual life, we fully undergo the pain or loss of control ourselves, have our narratives shuffled in surreal ways)<br/><br/>The place is a theater as said. Some of the most marvelous occasions are when we walk onto that stage and find ourselves slipping from real to fiction, or in the middle of a performance a spontaneous fire makes the narrative rattle. Norton's fiery interruption about his gin being replaced.<br/><br/>That's all fine, great in other hands. But even further inside I encounter the specific maker who made this, who can't help coloring everything else, creating it in his image. See, I was surprised to read near universal acclaim for this, knowing it comes by a filmmaker associated with histrionics in previous films.<br/><br/>A contrast forms. The best account I can give is this. <br/><br/>With a ""soft"" eye that doesn't dwell in particulars and feels the deeper undercurrents as they rise and subside, I sense the pull of oceanic power. The shifts from real to fiction to real that show truth to be a matter of illusory context. The improvised truth intruding into fiction and slippery ground it creates. The rhythm of the cuts and the shift of views, the whole instrumentation is often marvelous to see.<br/><br/>But the froth that ripples the surface, the tumult these currents create when they reach the narrative surface closer to us, the emotional splashing of inner conflict from the mouths of actors, these show a histrionic sensibility. The life we get that has to face age and loss becomes tantrum, actorly splashing around in the shallow instead of swimming out to sea.<br/><br/>These are two different modes of conveyance. One soft, wants to evoke and float. The other hard, thrashes about and fights to come up for air. The first evokes some of Altman's improvised jazz. The other PT Anderson's attempts to play much the same music but laboring and hitting the notes too stridently.<br/><br/>I want to say that Lubezcki had a lot to do with the former (who practiced next to Mann, Malick, and Cuaron, all preeminently visual makers) but it may just be Innaritu has both intuition and the urge to overstate."

","BIRDMAN is directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarrittu and stars Michael Keaton as a former movie superhero who takes it upon himself to direct, write and star in a Broadway play. Joining him are Zack Galifianakis, Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, and Edward Norton who play his agent, fellow cast members, and daughter. My initial thoughts when starting it weren't too great, but I gradually came to appreciate it a little more for its technical achievement and some interesting observations on the lives of actors. Still, in a film about the ego of actors and the importance of artistic expression (among other things), it came off as egotistical and self-important. Without giving away specifics or plot spoilers, I can say that the film is very ""meta."" Michael Keaton is playing a character who has some similarities, or shares some DNA, with his real-life persona, as does Edward Norton (apparently). Michael Keaton's Riggan Thompson is a former blockbuster movie star who is trying to do something artistic for personal validation, and Edward Norton's Mike Shiner is a method actor who probably takes his job a little too seriously. For me, those two characters (and their interactions) form the central dialogue and message the film is trying to get across. They also had the most interesting dynamic in the story. What I didn't necessarily warm up to was the rather cynical attitude it had towards critics and big-budget filmmaking. And some of the magical realism came off as labored attempts to be clever. Elements that did work a little more include Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography, giving the film a Malickian feel, and the drum score. Overall, I would say that I appreciated the film for what it is more than actually liking or enjoying it. It has an impeccable technical construction, but a lot of the dialogue and overt messaging felt more like therapy for actors and didn't engage me like a straightforward drama normally would. Even though this is Inarrittu's most playful film yet, it made me long for the emotional manipulation of something like 21 GRAMS. There is a time and place for different kinds of movies, and the way the film takes sides when they both feed into each other was rather disingenuous. I can understand why this film did so well at the Oscars, because Hollywood always likes patting themselves on the back, but it has mixed results as entertainment."

","It was pretty funny and independent. It tells you that it does not matter what people tell you (in a negative way) go ahead and make you dreams come true, follow your inner voice. Your inner voice is the one that you gotta listen first and its your best friend, I mean your inner voice is you. In this case Thomson (Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu) is Birdman. I like how the movie was recorded, it looked continuously, like if it wasn't cuts in there . It also encourages other actors, celebrities or famous people that is doesn't matter if you were famous once you can continue.<br/><br/>I like the work of the team of the actors, directors, producers... So if you have something to dream on, make it true. If you have haters stay deaf, and mistakes on your work, see what you are doing and do your best. Most of the time I analyze movie lessons, and write a small review if I like how the movie was filmed. So this time I will give it a 10, because I liked all of it."

","BIRDMAN – (or) The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance..!!<br/><br/>******************************************************************** ********* There are only four actors in the history of cinema to have donned roles of multiple superhero characters in their entire career – Ben Affleck, Ryan Reynolds, Chris Evans and Halle Berry. The title of the movie 'Birdman' and the trailer had made most of us believe that Michael Keaton is all set to join this 'elite' list. (I hope you remember that Keaton was the guy to have played 'Batman' in early 90s.) <br/><br/>But Birdman ISN'T A SUPERHERO MOVIE. It's a DARK COMEDY about an aged actor who had played the role of 'Birdman'- a superhero, in his popular days of career.<br/><br/>******************************************************************** ************* PLOT SUMMARY: Riggan Thompson is a yesteryear's actor to have played the character 'Birdman', who had decided against continuing with the franchise after two block buster hits. Following this till date, he struggles hard to attain recognition. He strongly believes that he has an actor inside him and tries hard to gain attraction towards his performing art. In the process, he abandons wealth and relationships.<br/><br/>The movie starts with actor playing his latest piece in the gamble by attempting to direct and act in a play to be staged in Broadway. The movie is a journey between the preview and the premiere of his play and the challenge that he faces from his co-actor, a theater critic and a troubled actor residing within him.<br/><br/>******************************************************************** ************ WHY IS THIS MOVIE, SUCH A BIG DEAL?: - The movie has earned nine Oscar nominations.<br/><br/><ul><li>If we had believed that Benedict Cumberbatch would have a cake walk at this year's Oscars, then Keaton proves us all wrong by putting forth a terrific performance. He brings in an effective portrayal of a man with emotional conflicts. He's adamant, he's troubled, he's selfish, he's ignorant and he's ambitious and successfully makes us resonate with his emotions. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>This movie also teaches you important philosophies of life, in a way similar to what 'FIGHT CLUB' and 'PULP FICTION' taught.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>With almost negligible background score used, the movie entirely banks on 'brilliant performance of actors'. Edward Norton and Emma stone are at their best.</li></ul><br/><br/>MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, The entire movie (barring the opening and few scenes towards the end), appears to be a single shot. It's CONTINUOUS with no cuts in between and makes us a part of its journey.<br/><br/>Most of us feel that 'TRACKING SHOT', (continuous shot, where camera follows the subject on screen) is one of the easiest shots to take. But to shoot the entire movie in what appears like a single tracking shot, is one serious business where most of the filmmakers would not want to get into. <br/><br/>This fact alone should earn the movie gallons of admiration and make it a strong contender at this year's Oscars for DIRECTION and CINEMATOGRAPHY. (I am surprised that it hasn't earned a nomination for its 'EDITING').<br/><br/>******************************************************************** *************** WHO WOULD LOVE IT? - Any aspiring actor, any established actor who understands the difference between 'fame' and 'recognition of art'. If you fall in this category, you can easily relate to this movie. This movie shows the triumph of passion towards art over everything else. - People who study cinema or people with theater background. - Anyone who loves movies which boasts terrific acting performances. - People who have always loved the movies that have earned Oscar nominations. <br/><br/>******************************************************************** ************** SIMILARITIES: I am surprised to see no comparisons being drawn with 'BLACK SWAN'. I am of this feeling that, this 'BIRDMAN' is actually a male version of 'BLACK SWAN'- execution style being the other difference. <br/><br/>******************************************************************** ************** BOTTOMLINE: If you have liked any of these movies - BLACK SWAN, A REQUIEM OF DREAM, KING'S SPEECH,<br/><br/>You would definitely love this.<br/><br/>This movie also preaches some of the important philosophies of life that would prove beneficial to you in current times. If you have loved those philosophies in 'PULP FICTION' and 'FIGHT CLUB', then you wouldn't want to miss this movie..!<br/><br/>This movie isn't a movie which you can ENJOY. This is one of those movies into which you can only get absorbed. It's an education – you might get bored or you might end up with a beautiful feeling. :)"

Telling a story of the constant pursuing of every little bit of fame, glory or approval, it finds itself 'loved' by millions, by no one or simply forgotten - but perhaps, free.

","This film is highly recommended. (☆☆☆☆)<br/><br/>Remember the film, Black Swan, a surreal and visually stunning film that dealt with a dancer's descent into madness? Well, that beautiful but deadly swan has turned into an ugly duckling of sorts. That film now has been resurrected into another surreal and visually stunning film, only this time, it deals with an actor's descent into madness. The film is Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance).<br/><br/>Riggan Thomas (Michael Keaton) is that actor. Once a famous celebrity for his role as a comic book hero and now a zero, a mere footnote of cinema history. But he is about to stage a comeback, a play that he has written, directed and will be the featured star. That is, if he can overcome the many professional and personal obstacles when producing a Broadway show, Those hardships include: Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), a high-strung and gifted Actor (with a capital A), his Broadway co-star Leslie (Naomi Watt), Riggan's worrisome friend and producer (Zach Galifianakis), his young girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough), his strung-out daughter Sam (Emma Stone), and his former wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan). As things steadily go wrong (and you know they will), Riggan's world quickly spins out of control.<br/><br/>Much of the film is seen from Riggan's crazed point of view. We watch the madness begin to permeate his life and the absurdities and hardships seem to multiply at a rapid pace. We are taken on a journey of the mind and flow along with the film's rhythms and mood swings. That is, until Birdman's final scene, where the film becomes somewhat arbitrary and confusing. The movie's parting shot makes its ending problematic and contradicts much of what is seen before it. (If only the film could have ended a minute or two earlier, the overall result would have been more satisfying for this moviegoer.) But that being said, what a remarkable film Birdman is! This is still a special one-of-a-kind movie-going experience. It is a film of sheer audacity and bold exciting ideas. <br/><br/>Birdman has been masterfully directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu. Iñárritu takes his story (which he co-wrote with Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, and Armando Bo) and layers his film with many flourishes and unexpected turns. He structures his film and choreographs every move with marked precision. The film is stylishly made without being overdone or obvious. The director stages his film as if it is one continuous tracking shot, given the film an edgy and dreamlike vibe. Reality blend seamlessly with fantasy as one hallucination simply flows into another and what an incredible effect it all is! Kudos to Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrone for their superb editing and Emmanuel Lubezki's magnificent photography which creates the unreal world of its main character so succinctly. The film boasts some award- winning acting too.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton is brilliant as in the title role. Birdman has a bit of the autobiographical by casting this actor, a former Batman himself and reclusive actor. It is a risk that pays off in spades. Keaton balances that perfect mix between the absurd and the real. The actor displays his comic talents most effectively and also shows the tragic side in his portrait of a man on the verge of destruction. This is a comeback breakout performance within a comeback breakdown performance.<br/><br/>Giving Keaton ample support are a wonderful ensemble who deliver memorable comic moments, particularly Norton as his narcissistic foil and Stone as his damaged daughter. Lindsey Duncan also has a pivotal scene between critic and actor that is quite memorable.<br/><br/>All of the artisans behind the camera, the gifted ensemble of actors, and particularly, Iñárritu's expert direction completely energize the film. Expect the unexpected in this dark comedy. Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) cannot be easily ignored. This is innovative filmmaking of the highest order.

"FilmMuscle","8","3","12","6 November 2014"," Uh Oh, Critic Says Birdman Isn't Perfect
","Long gone are the days of Michael Keaton's Batman stardom. Hollywood has dramatically changed since then, and Keaton has found himself in a totally different position, replaced by new superstars to take up the superhero and blockbuster roles. Those days of fame and flowing paychecks have waned for not only the actor but the man who he intimately portrays in this black comedy, Riggan Thomson. Twenty years since starring in the Birdman franchise (ha, get it?), he has diminished into obscurity—hardly drawing in crowds for barely- constructed Broadway productions. That inherent feeling of self- importance is killing Riggan, the artist, inside with how far he has faded from the public eye. <br/><br/>If there's one thing Birdman's narrative is particularly exceptional at, it's the honest and cynical look at the sheer egoism and narcissism that make up artists/actors. You always need to feel like you're the highlight of the show—the one that gets the headlines and fan girls. But when the startling truth of your irrelevance becomes realized, an ego hurt is like a soul penetrated with a keen knife. Riggan is struggling to finally make that comeback and eventually leave the world with a true legacy. He desperately wants people to admire him and to remember him as the legend his alter ego—the deep-voiced, snarky Birdman himself—and he think he is. There's no question that this is one of those films that rely more on its performances than its plot/narrative. <br/><br/>Consequently, this is where mixed feelings materialize, but Alejandro Iñárritu's latest ambitious picture still boasts an incredible ensemble nonetheless that ranges from the greats like Naomi Watts and Edward Norton to newcomers who're still on the path to prove themselves like Zach Galifianakis and Emma Stone. Norton seemingly plays a role that also mocks his career and well-known personality. Whereas Keaton is yearning for admiration and respect here, Norton doesn't give two hoots about audience reception as he focuses more on his utter artistry and method acting ability, despite letting his bossiness and arrogance dominate the backstage production. Stone plays Riggin's daughter, Sam, who's a recovering drug addict but also frankly exasperated by her father's self-centered tendencies, constantly hanging around the theater with snide remarks. <br/><br/>The one-take, franticly intrusive cinematography—seamlessly continuous at least in appearance—plays another essential character that complements and strengthens the already-excellent performances with a fair share of close-ups and orbital shots, traversing through majestically foggy corridors and the tragically theatrical stage to the perpetual sound of pounding drums. Thankfully, cinematographer Emmanuele Lubezski (also wildly impressing us last year with Gravity's arrant technical prowess) refrains from distracting the audience with blatant visual showiness since the fast-paced drama of stress on-screen would immediately take me back into the story whenever I'd momentarily heed the actual maneuvering of the camera. <br/><br/>With that being said, Birdman is not perfect even though I hear the majority enthusiastically praising its genius and applauding it much like the easily-charmed audience that show up to see Riggan. A particular memorable scene in the film features a showdown between the artist (Riggan or Norton's Mike) and a New York Times critic (played effectively by Lindsay Duncan) as the two entertainingly bash each other with non-stop hurtful comments. It's clear that Birdman doesn't overtly respect the movie/theatre critic (it's unsurprising since many critics have had issues with Iñárritu's style over the years—Babel and Biutiful, for instance) as it rants with a fire about how especially entitled and unappreciative the critics are. Regardless of the wild generalizations and exaggerations made here, it keeps going and going with so much anger that the effect might either be that of irksome offense to the average critic or that of guilt. <br/><br/>Sadly and perhaps guiltily, to vast irony, this is the point where I have to criticize this work of art (oh no!) because Birdman does indeed suffer from issues I simply couldn't ignore—problems that left me with considerable dissatisfaction, angry at the film for not allowing me to leave with the same pleasure like everyone else. First of all—as with most of Iñárritu's work—the film is so self-indulgent that I practically could see it incessantly grinning at just how clever it thinks its dialogue/screenplay is, even though everything executed and delivered quite heavy-handedly. There's no sense of subtlety and calmness to be found since the story is essentially an epic boisterous tirade. Surprisingly for such a prestigious picture, it also carries with plentiful of immature, shallow humor (""this place smells like balls""), and personally, most of the dark comedy intended didn't exactly deliver—occasionally a half-suppressed laugh to be had. The humor overall either felt underwhelming in its simplicity at times or like it was trying really hard to be witty in other moments. <br/><br/>The ending was easily the most frustrating segment of this parade, being that it extended far beyond adequacy even though neither the narrative nor the thematic material was any more strengthened by the protracted length. Not to delve into spoilers, but the whole ordeal seemed like it was more so attempting to end on a positive/hopeful note rather than on a poignant, satirically startling shot that literally left my jaw open. <br/><br/>Overall, when a film exists more for its themes rather than a compelling narrative, that's when I usually identify a hint of pretension within. Even despite its magnificent performances, phenomenal cinematography, and catchy score, Birdman can understandably be deemed slightly pretentious and schizophrenic (with the way it tries to shove more and more ideas and messages into its already-bloated satire while bouncing back and further between them with mumbling enunciation)."

","Birdman does an excellent job at providing an experience. The unique use of the camera is particularly noteworthy as it allows the audience to feel present in each situation. Birdman focuses a lot on duality and for that reason it succeeds! Each character has inner demons, some more obvious than others, and each are given chances to overcome those issues. The acting in this film is fantastic, I don't see Michael Keaton in this film I see Riggin Thompson. The dialogue is also very impressive in this film which makes each character seem real and relatable. While this is an amazing film it isn't perfect, I thought the ending could have been handled better. What I mean is I am not a fan of their use of fantasy at the end... Is he really flying? Did he die on stage? Did he commit suicide in the hospital? Is Riggin's daughter seeing him as he sees himself now? While the ending is very intriguing and does make you think like that I still feel like it could have been executed better. Maybe it's just so well done that it needs even more time for analysis. Anyway it's a very enjoyable movie!! Go see it!!!"

","The first time we see Michael Keaton in his tighty-whities in ""Birdman,"" it's from behind. His character, a formerly high-flying movie star, is sitting in the lotus position in his dressing room of a historic Broadway theater, only he's levitating above the ground. Bathed in sunlight streaming in from an open window, he looks peaceful. But a voice inside his head is growling, grumbling, gnawing at him grotesquely about matters both large and small. The next time we see Keaton in his tighty-whities in ""Birdman,"" he's dashing frantically through Times Square at night, having accidentally locked himself out of that same theater in the middle of a performance of a Raymond Carver production that he stars in, wrote and directed. He's swimming upstream through a river of gawking tourists, autograph seekers, food carts and street performers. But despite the chaos that surrounds him, he seems purposeful, driven and–for the first time–oddly content. These are the extremes that director Alejandro G. Inarritu navigates with audacious ambition and spectacular skill in ""Birdman""–the full title of which is ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)."" He's made a film that's both technically astounding yet emotionally rich, intimate yet enormous, biting yet warm, satirical yet sweet. It's also the first time that Inarritu, the director of ponderous downers like ""Babel"" and ""Biutiful,"" actually seems to be having some fun. Make that a ton of fun. ""Birdman"" is a complete blast from start to finish. The gimmick here– and it's a dozy, and it works beautifully–is that Inarritu has created the sensation that you are watching a two-hour film shot all in one take. Working with the brilliant and inventive cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (who won an Oscar this year for shooting ""Gravity"" for Inarritu's close friend and fellow Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron), Inarritu has constructed the most delicate and dazzling high-wire act. And indeed, before shooting began, the director sent his cast a photo of Philippe Petit walking a tightrope between the World Trade Center towers as inspiration. Through impossibly long, intricately choreographed tracking shots, the camera swoops through narrow corridors, up and down tight stairways and into crowded streets. It comes in close for quiet conversations and soars between skyscrapers for magical-realism flights of fancy. A percussive and propulsive score from Antonio Sanchez, heavy on drums and cymbals, maintains a jazzy, edgy vibe throughout. Sure, you can look closely to find where the cuts probably happened, but that takes much of the enjoyment out of it. Succumbing to the thrill of the experience is the whole point. Just as thrilling is the tour-DE-force performance from Keaton in the role of a lifetime as Riggan Thompson, a washed-up actor trying to regain the former glory he achieved as the winged action hero Birdman. The film follows the fraught early going of his Broadway debut which is also his last shot at greatness–although his on-screen alter ego doesn't help much by voicing his fears and making him doubt himself incessantly. Yes, it's knowingly amusing that Keaton, who peaked 20-plus years ago as a superhero, is playing an actor who peaked 20-plus years ago as a superhero. Although I'd happily argue that Keaton's Batman for Tim Burton in 1989 is THE definitive performance of the iconic character–but that's a whole 'nother conversation for another time. Or is it? While ""Birdman"" exists in its own meticulously realized world, it's very much of this time and place from a pop-culture perspective, with references to other real-life actors like Robert Downey Jr. and Michael Fassbender who've enjoyed enormous success when they've donned the superhero duds. The script from Inarritu, Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo is cleverly meta without being too cutesy and self-satisfied. Keaton gets to toy with his persona a bit–as well as acknowledge how comparatively quiet his career has been in recent years–but seeing him in seasoned form provides its own joy. He's still hyper-verbal and playful and he can still be amusing and lacerating in his delivery, but there's a wry wistfulness and even a desperation in the mix now that's achingly poignant. Also confronting his real-life reputation is Edward Norton as Mike Shiner, the brilliant but infamously capricious actor who steps in as Riggan's co-star just as previews are about to begin on his labor-of-love production of ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" Norton, who's come with the baggage of being difficult and demanding over the years, finds just the right balance between arrogance and sincerity. Besides, they need each other, as they find in the days leading up to opening night. They all need each other. Inarritu has amassed a tremendous supporting cast and made ridiculous technical demands of them, yet they've all more than risen to the occasion and relished the chance to shine. Zach Galifianakis plays strongly against type as Riggan's manager and the rare voice of reason in the middle of all this madness. Emma Stone is adorable as Riggan's world-weary, wise-ass daughter who also serves as his assistant. (She and Norton have crackling chemistry in a couple of crucial scenes.) Amy Ryan does wonders with her brief screen time as Riggan's ex-wife; she fleshes him out and allows us to see both the selfish and the good in him. And Naomi Watts, who starred in Inarritu's wrenching ""21 Grams,"" gets to play both light and heavy moments as a neurotic fellow cast member. It's powerfully clear that they all worked their asses of to make this complicated thrill ride look effortless. The result is one of the best times you'll have at the movies this year–which might even be the best movie this year."
"Necroambulant","9","2","7","12 May 2015"," Welcome Back, Michael Keaton
","Birdman is definitely not the sort of movie for a person who can't stand art house style movies, because it has major elements of that...but I recommend that you get past those reservations, if you have them, because this is a fantastic movie. The story is a truly fascinating exploration into the life of an actor struggling desperately to regain some sort or relevance on the stage after having a film career compressed down to the point of only being remembered for a superhero role he had years before...all of this in the middle of a nervous breakdown that he is barely containing. It absolutely does not neglect the people around him though, spending an equal amount of time on the other characters in the movie. Michael Keaton is the only actor who could have brought this sort of authenticity to the role, what with his portrayal of Batman being the most memorable role of his career aside from perhaps Beetlejuice or Mr. Mom (Depending on how old you are). The whole cast is amazing though, especially Edward Norton, in a truly meta experience as he is doing an amazing job of overshadowing Keaton in the lead role both in the movie itself and the stage performance within the movie (albeit in a more intentional, malicious sense in the latter). Zach Galifianakis playing the straight man (and arguably the most reasonable and sensible individual throughout the whole movie) was a peculiar choice, but it worked out unbelievably well. I should have watched this a couple of weeks ago. If I had known I would like it this much, I would have."

","Birdman is one of the greatest films i have seen in recent memory. I had heard a lot of buzz about Birdman and if it is possible this movie surpassed the hype laid upon me before watching this film. <br/><br/>This film is about a man Riggan played by Michael Keaton who is putting on a play to try and revive his career after years of playing the notorious charter Birdman.He is doing this to prove that he is no washed up actor like everyone thinks he is. <br/><br/>The first notable attribute to this film is the way it was directed.Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu is the director of this film and he blows it out of the water.This film was shot and edited to look as if it was one giant take.This is relevant because the movie is based around a play witch is all one take if you don't count intermission.I know imaging a film all in one shot might seem impossible but Gonzalez using clever camera tricks makes its so you don't even notice the cuts. Other than that the shots he sets up are fluid and nice to look at.All of this put together makes it seem that you are passively watching these charters at all times.This is a big way the movie hooks you feel like your with the charters and make you feel more attached to them and the actions they take. <br/><br/>Second the casting for this movie was spot on.Michael Keaton as a actor who seemed to disappear for years after his super hero role and make a come back could not have been more perfect.Also the chemistry between the whole cast including Edward Norton,Emma Stone,Naomi Watts etc. This cast together not only creates great dialogue but also makes it feel so real and funny. <br/><br/>If you are a movie buff you will love this movie , not only because of the technicality and acting but the satire too.This film pokes fun at the movie business and movie media.So making a review about a movie that make fun of movie critic's almost feels like a crime <br/><br/>On my final note it doesn't matter if you are a movie buff or not, you will mostly likely enjoy this movie or love it like i did. I'm going to give this movie a 9-10 because i don't rate anything 10 because nothing perfect and that means perfect. On the other hand this is about as close to perfect as you can get."

","I am a huge fan of Michael Keaton. This film has so many amazing talents that it just boggles my mind what went wrong. It derails about 40 minutes in and this train never gets back on track. Sadly, it seems these days that it's all about hype and glitz and the Oscars can be bought and paid for. To be honest, when they are not snubbing films like Dark Knight and praising anything from France and ""Bollywood"" they are sitting around acting self important and giving awards to films like this. A great idea that is so muddled and wrongly executed that it borders on ridiculous. I did find the cinematography to be fun and creative, if done too much these days. The one continuous shot idea has worn out it's welcome faster than the horrible shakycam ""found footage"" even. But this one does it well, and the performances are simply amazing. The issue lies in the director I think. Showing us the world through pretentious, art-house colored glasses that reek of self-importance and ego. It is a film that has divided the audience. And it also divided me. Part of me was impressed with Keaton and the cast so much that I loved it, the other was ready to punch the Pretentious Product-Make director in the Puss. I'd say rent it if it's real cheap, but only for the great cast, not the forced tragedy story. Predictable ending be damned."

The main character is interesting, deep and sympathetic but so is his protagonist, so is his sullen bad tempered daughter. He is not just an ageing actor, the film asks what we are and why we think we are here and what we crave from others.

"megatom64","8","2","7","11 January 2015"," Flawed and Pretentious but ultimately an interesting movie
","Spoilers in this film.<br/><br/>Birdman is an utterly strange film. A movie that decidedly lacks a strong form and replaces it with an ever flowing dream like perception of reality. Simply based on the acting and editing, Birdman is a triumph of a film. The performances are strong and nuanced, but ultimately it is the film's ironic self importance that causes it to crumble at times.<br/><br/>The movie ultimately would have been leagues better if it filtered its narrative down to just be about Riggan. Extending to all the other side stories IMO detracts from the film in a big way. <br/><br/>The opening starts off throwing 100 subplots at you, to the point where it almost feels like satire ala the film Airplane. When you have ""everything going wrong"" in the play then some unintroduced female character jumps in and says ""I'm pregnant, and it's your baby!"" The film feels very very melodramatic in a weekday soap opera kind of way. Or when a character says ""I would take out your eye and put them in my head so I could see the way you see at your age"" I can't help but roll my eyes. <br/><br/>Like previous efforts by this director it feels overly preachy, melodramatic, and at time eye-rollingly sentimental. Yet the core character is achieved so very well. The message is something interesting even if it bashes you over the head with it so hard, you can't tell if it is really being serious about that point any more. You can only tell every character and every element of the story that ""it doesn't matter"" so many times before you can't help but ask ""then why am I watching this?"" <br/><br/>This movie reminds me of some annoying tropes of fiction, like writing a book about how hard it is to write a book, or making a movie about making a movie. It makes all of these jobs and people to be so overly self-important that they just come across as irrelevant and difficult to connect with. <br/><br/>Riggan and his ex-wife were the only really sympathetic characters I found in the film. Edward Norton's character was detestably self-important as was Niomi Watts and Emma Stone. <br/><br/>Having said all of this, the movie is good and original. It just feels like it didn't land on the tone it should have to have been a really great film. It is interesting, funny at times, and something that you will think about for a while. I know what I was left thinking about was what the filmmaker's true intention was. <br/><br/>Over all though this movie feels really really overrated, don't go into it thinking it is a masterpiece like I was lead to believe, because it is a very flawed movie from a story and writing standpoint. The acting, directing, and editing help to elevate the average and at times outright corny writing."

","Perhaps it's just me. Every year before the Oscars, a rash of movies appear hoping for recognition at the most prestigious award ceremony in the movie calendar - but in truth not many of them really impress, and Birdman I'm sorry to say falls into said category.<br/><br/>Other than yet another stellar performance from Michael Keaton and a clever(ish) premise, Birdman fails to live up to the huge amount of hype surrounding it. I'm not saying this is a bad movie - far from it. As mentioned, the performances are excellent and there are moments when it looks as if we're going to be treated to some really intense detours into the madness that must inherently pervade some (if not all) actors - after all, the best among them would be locked away if it wasn't for their given career choice.<br/><br/>But that's the problem - there are just moments. Nothing deep and meaningful, nothing surprising or revealing of the human condition either. There are really enjoyable scenes though. Edward Norton sporting a 'huge' boner in the bedroom scene at the end of the play is giggle worthy, and Keaton demolishing his room by (possibly) performing feats of psychokinesis is both startling and convincing - but again, you want to know more about this particular trait but are left with unanswered questions.<br/><br/>Half of the problem, is that you never find out whether his character is in fact in possession of super-human abilities like his alter- ego - and if so, how? There will be arguments for and against the decision of the director to take this route (fans of the 'insulting the intelligence of the audience' standpoint may take a bow now), but personally I've seen enough 'make your own mind up' endings in movies (Mulholland Drive, Persona) to know when one works, and when it doesn't. Had this been made clear from an early point in the film, it could have given Birdman more weight - but again, this is just a personal view.<br/><br/>Technically this is a tight film and certainly an enjoyable way to burn a couple of hours. Oscar worthy? I think not. Keaton is a shoe-in for an award this year, and there are plenty of reasons why he deserves it. Birdman, however, isn't one of them.<br/><br/>6.9 / 10"

It struck me as being very much an actors' movie, with too many inside jokes and meanings to really reach the audience. Michael Keaton really tries hard as a former action movie hero at the end of his rope, who is prepared to gamble his entire career on an avant garde Broadway adaption of a Raymond Carver novel. Emma Stone, Edward Norton and Naomi Watts all try even harder as the central character's daughter and fellow actors. The special effects such as flying and Keaton's ability to move objects around his dressing room struck me as more about wowing the audience than meaning anything. There are some amusing and interesting scenes, such as Keaton getting locked out of the back of the theatre and having to go to the front doors, running the gauntlet, half naked, of the crowds in Times Square. But there are too many scenes where the characters simply emote for no good reason -- most of Stone's scenes fall into this category. The ending was rather distressing and I felt it was a cheap resolution."

","I have been really missing Manhattan: the noise, the grittiness, the incredible lunacy and wonder that is New York City. So my holiday gift to myself was tonight's viewing of Birdman, an emotion packed, theater-centric gem of a film that sets you right in the midst of all that is Manhattan and into the back alleys and twisty corridors of the St. James Theater. Michael Keaton gives an astonishing turn as, Riggan, a mature film actor who has walked away from a lucrative career as an action hero to pursue 'relevance' by adapting, directing and starring in a Broadway play. Ed Norton is the slightly off kilter supporting actor who saves the play by stepping in during previews to bolster the troope, and possibly steal the show. Emma Stone plays Riggan's smart-ass wounded, recovering addict daughter now working as his assistant and Naomi Watts turns in a solid performance as the fragile first time Broadway actress. All the paranoia, fear, anger and angst of actors gives the film a wildly unpredictable plot that, at times, borders on both the insane and the macabre – or is it all an act? Most viewers won't care as the director pulls us in from the first frame, as we follow the characters down and up and down again through the corridors and across the catwalks of the theater, and into our minds and our hearts.

"bobsgrock","Null","2","7","18 November 2014"," The Virtue of Bemused Bewilderment
","Has Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu reinvented himself through Michael Keaton? The director of films known more for their universally- connected narratives, ensemble casts and flashy but suffocating visual styles has kept only the flash and instead gone small-scale and intimate. Yet, even in reinventing his narrative methods, he has still maintained certain personal elements that keep one from being able to pin down exactly what type of movie Birdman is. At times, you may feel as if you have the rest of the film figured out, only for Iñárritu to do a near-180 spin that leaves you thinking about why and whether or not it works. Then again, whether it works or not may be a moot point when it comes to this director.<br/><br/>Every once in awhile, fate or some other external force graces film- goers with a pleasant experience by permitting circumstances to wed a particular actor with a particular role. Whether poetic justice comes into play is still to be determined, but few would be able to see the casting of Michael Keaton as a former blockbuster star attempting to reinvent his career on Broadway as anything but a marvelously innovative notion. Aside from noting the obvious imitations of art into life with Keaton's history as Batman, it is interesting to study how Keaton is able to unravel himself as an actor with more capabilities and dimensions than any of his previous roles have allowed him. He embraces age, the thinning hair exposing his round forehead, the facial hair sporadically spread over his face like vegetation in the desert. Aside from his brief tenure as the Dark Knight, Keaton has always seemed a marginalized actor; a familiar face but not noteworthy as a bona-fide star. This judgment no longer holds true.<br/><br/>As much of a revelation as Keaton is, he may have the dubious misfortune to be in the same movie as Edward Norton, whose interpretation of a method actor incapable of leading any semblance of a real life without resorting to thespian techniques is an astonishing triumph. Norton has always been understood to be a massively talented actor who for whatever reason has kept his talent to a smaller pool of roles which, nevertheless, have become indelible for many since he burst onto the screen 18 years ago. In some ways, this role mirrors his own career in much the same way as Keaton's does. Still, nothing has prepared us for this kind of Norton intensity. He is at once vain, empathetic, sweet and cruel. Such a memorable performance can be undone, however, if the film's focus becomes distracted and we lose sight of a great supporting role, which seems to be the case here. The last 20 minutes become completely about Keaton, yet our interest in Mike Shiner has only increased, leading us to be incredulous as to the conclusion of his importance. What exactly was it supposed to be? And are we supposed to ignore these feelings while following Riggan Thomson down his path of enlightenment?<br/><br/>If this sounds like criticism of the director's capabilities, it is more a questioning of his intentions. There can be little doubt regarding Iñárritu's talent as a director. Indeed, his ability to utilize the illusion of one continuous take throughout the whole film seems like a cheap gimmick at first, though eventually we become used to its effect, which is never overtly flashy or self- conscious. In many ways, you cannot help but be amazed at how much Iñárritu is able to fit into each frame, considering how often it fluctuates. Still, its actual effect will puzzle some viewers. What is its intended purpose other than to show off Iñárritu's ability as well as the intimate setting, in front and behind the curtain, of a Broadway play? Some have claimed it breaks down filmic barriers in order to bring the audience closer to the actors as they relate to their surroundings but the effect has little to do with its practicality. <br/><br/>For all its technical prowess and intense acting, Birdman at its most bleakly poignant remains a well-tread tale of a man who put his career before family and relationships. Such themes add nothing new to the experience of watching the story of a man attempting to redeem himself but Iñárritu's methods are convincingly overwhelming. One critic described the film as ""vacuous virtuosity."" If ever there was a label for mixed feelings this would be it, and Birdman would be that movie."

","Everybody seems to like the drama of a comeback. After all, there's something inspiring about anyone who rises from a great fall. And so it goes that Birdman features Michael Keaton portraying an actor who puts everything on the line to restart his career by staging Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk about when We Talk about Love,"" not the most easy-going material to act out or convey to an audience. Along the way, there is much support from Naomi Watts as an actress making her Broadway debut, Edward Norton as a smart-ass, temperamental, hot-item actor and Emma Stone, who plays Keaton's daughter, apparently neglected from growing up with a show business father. It's all very emotionally complicated and sometimes overbearing due to all of the characters' constant bickering, petulance, regret and hand-wringing. Also, amidst all of these real-life dramas, Director Alejandro G. Inarritu injects a kind of supernatural, whimsical element that may be more distracting than constructive.

","Birdman is undoubtedly the best film of 2014. And Keaton certainly deserves the Oscar for his numb-rendering performance. The screenplay weaves together everything beautiful. The surprise black comedy works very well. Innaritu's direction gets better with every frame. The last one minute of the film locks your attention in a sleeper hold. The climax packs a powerful, unexpected, somewhat ambiguous yet spectacular punch, allowing you to let your imagination fly. The camera works are excellent, making the film appear more cohesive. The background score melts with the mood of the film. The sound mixing is delicious. The editing is taut and not one frame meanders. What takes Birdman a notch higher is the impeccable cast. Keaton is at the zenith, delivering his career's finest performance, breaking into the character of Riggan and not leaving a single stone unturned. He by far excels Eddie Redmayne, yet may succumb in the race for the Oscar. Edward Norton nails it the moment he appears on the screen. Right from Fight Club, that man has been outdoing himself at every opportunity. In any other year, the Oscar would have been his but not this year. Courtesy: JK Simmons. Emma Stone as Riggan's disturbed druggist daughter imbues a certain discreet charm into her role. Zach Galifianakis specializes in comedy and that is what he delivers, that too in top form. Naomi Watts does well with whatever little her role offers.<br/><br/>Verdict: Birdman captures ego, frustration and breaking free of a washed-out Broadway actor in a unique and captivating piece of cinema that is a masterpiece in every sense, the best of last year. Innaritu most certainly deserves a bow for it."

","I am a big fan of sophisticated movies that tease your imagination and make you think that there is something hidden in every dialogue or scene. Maybe Birdman is one of those movies, or maybe it is just a load of nonsense that is well delivered by Michael Keaton. <br/><br/>Yes the acting is great, specially by Keaton (Oscar worthy) and Norton and yes there is a continuous flow in the movie that allows all other actors to demonstrate their abilities. However, it feels like this movie needs more life and emotion in it. There are some sparks and outbursts of raw feeling but it is not enough to make the movie watchable for 2 hours.<br/><br/>I advice you not to fall into the trap of the general hype and all this ""Oscar praise"" that this movie received for god knows what.

Michael Keaton really delivers a tour de force performance, I really don't understand why he is so underrated as an actor, he deserves so much better then what he is giving most of the time.

","Well, I thought the other negative reviews were right. If you've actually seen great movies, then you can see how this one doesn't even come close. That's even true with ""off-beat"" movies, like this one. Which is better - this or BEING THERE? THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS? THE ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF A SPOTLESS MIND? DR. STRANGELOVE? 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY?

Ironically, this is true despite its theme, which is supposed to be an actor/director's search for artistic truth. As you watch this movie, you get the feeling that the filmmaker is deliberately trying to impress you (or somebody) with cutesy gimmicks in various forms, rather than just make the best possible movie he can.<br/><br/>I also agree with various user comments that a lot of the dialog is weak (if not also just plain unattractive) and the actors' performances become irrelevant when the subject matter doesn't reach the feelings of the viewer. At the one-hour mark, I found myself starting to look at my watch to see how much longer this would go on. The bottom line is, for all the cutesy gimmicks, this just doesn't work for way too many viewers. The fact that industry insiders claim to get a lot out of the story doesn't cure that. <br/><br/>That said, although I was tempted to do like so many other articulate reviewers have done and give it a solitary one star in an effort to drag down its seemingly incomprehensible 8.1 rating (at this juncture, at least) to something more reasonable, in the end I decided to be intellectually more rigorous and gave it a six, my usual rating for a movie which is technically good yet is not compelling entertainment at any level for even the most thoughtful of lay audiences."
"newmailbrendan","10","2","8","8 February 2015"," An ambitious, thought-provoking story.
","DESCRIPTION OF THE STORYLINE: At his core, the movie is a rarely seen character development story about a famous Broadway actor who does his best to get appreciation and to keep his reputation by the audiences and critics. <br/><br/>But there's something else going on too. Birdman is the character for the show Birdman, that was created by Riggan (the actor). But it seems like Riggan have the powers of Birdman. Birdman have the gift to move objects without touching them, to fly and other things that are impossible to do. Also, Riggan hear voices of Birdman in his head that is trying to manipulate him into doing things against his will. But is Birdman really Riggan, and Riggan really Birdman?<br/><br/>When losing a actor due an incident (or according to Riggan: something he let happened), Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson is desperate to find a new actor for the Broadway show. When eventually a new actor was introduced into the show, he seemed to know all the lines. However, his acting skills were of highly valuable interests for the show. As he is getting an important role in the movie, Riggan's daughter Sam (played by Emma Stone) is little for little falling in love with the new actor, Mike (Edwarn Norton). <br/><br/>As different circumstances and various occasions land on the path of the overall success of the show on Broadway, Riggan is slowly losing his grip and gets out of control. When smashing objects with using his 'Birdman Powers', we get an clear answer of the cause of the powers immediately after someone walks into his room. We see him using his hands as he smashes things to the wall. That delivers the logical conclusion that all this 'Birdman Powers' was in his head, it was his own imagination constantly. <br/><br/>As time goes on, Birdman is more and more taking over Riggan. Eventually, it even gets to the point where he imagined a whole battle in the streets of NYC and is slowly loosing gravity as he floats to the rooftop of a house. In reality, he's standing on the edge of the roof. When a man tried to help him to call somebody for him, Riggan jumped off the house and flies through the streets of NYC. When arrived at this destination, a taxi driver yells at him for not paying the ride. Again, a logical answer to an illogical happening.<br/><br/>When crafting to the final moments of Birdman, Riggan and his crew put on a show for the ages, according to applause of the audience after the first half. When preparing for the second half, Rigggan switches from a fake pistol (where the red plastic is clearly visible), to a real pistol with one bullet in it. As the second half is on the way, Riggan steps on stage and sets an amazingly incredible performance with lines that is an self reflection to his personality and character in the movie. After the incident he finds himself in a hospital where he actually looks like Birdman, due to the treatment of his nose. Yeah, he shot himself in the nose. Unbelievable. Finally, the actor earned a good review and is appreciated by many audiences and critics. His daughter even made a Twitter page for him! <br/><br/>After everything he had achieved and accomplished, he decided to open the hospital window and close (or open?)the door of The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 'A thing is a thing not what is said of that thing.'"

","The story revolves around Riggan(Michael Keaton), a down-and-out actor, who after having lost his fortune and fame post a few superhero movies ,turns to Broadway with the intention of achieving the same success as he did in his prime. In pursuing this goal, he absolutely destroys his personal life. The most significant impact, can be seen on his relationship with his daughter(played by a brilliant Emma Stone), who is recuperating from a drug rehabilitation which was a consequence of her parent's divorce. Riggan is producing, directing and acting in a play co-produced by his friend-cum-advocate,Jake. Following an accident involving his lead actor,he finds a replacement in his lead actress' lover(played by Edward Norton),who in his own words, is leading a life of lie all the time he's not on stage. Riggan faces tensions from all the above characters. Not to forget, he keeps hearing the voice of his ego, actually the superhero, Birdman, he played. There is a highly narcissist reporter who plans to destroy his play in the mix as well. Despite all this, he demonstrates faith in himself and keeps fighting along. Towards the end , he finally realizes his unhealthy obsession with the play that had cost him his personal life and takes a drastic measure. The ending is the most talked about issue. It appears to be a figment of Riggan's/his soul's imagination that his daughter finally sees him for the person he thought himself to be; better and relevant than anyone else. One who was not going to be scared of going the extra mile to fulfill his dream.<br/><br/>The entire cast was phenomenal, especially Keaton and Stone; with ample support from Ed Norton.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is the fact that the entire movie is like a single take. Just like LIFE. No do overs, no replays and no fast forward. Except for in the end. Even the jazz music that's played, is a part of the film. The direction was Phenomenal to say the least and the director deserves an Oscar.<br/><br/>Chances are that you may not like the film, but dare to think outside the limitations to which are minds have been restricted to by the crass and dumb movies being made. If, you get it, it will blow your mind.It has got LOL moments in between and also serves as an excellent satire on the current mindset of the film industry all over the world.

"PrashunChakraborty","8","2","8","6 February 2015"," Lot to like but longer than it should have been
","Riggan (Micheal Keaton) was once the biggest movie star on the planet when he portrayed the superhero Birdman but after Birdman 3 he decided he wanted to be taken seriously as an actor and started focusing on serious acting. However this didn't work out and now he is a washed up actor trying to do Broadway to revive his career and stay relevant, which is poetic because Michael Keaton was a phenomenal actor who never got his due once he stopped being Batman after 1992 (coincidentally the year the last Birdman film was released). Riggan is a complicated but vain character he is doing Broadway not because he cares about acting but because he is scared the world doesn't need him anymore, he wants to be wanted, he wants to be admired but not as The Birdman which is what he is most famous for.<br/><br/>Riggan's Birdman fame has psychologically damaged his mind and his alterego has taken a life of it's own and the voices in his head mock and demean him, they tell him to don the Birdman suit back on and make more money than the man in the tin can costume (Robert Downey Jr.). Maybe Riggan thinks if he is a successful Broadway actor he can get rid of The Birdman which haunts his mind, all these complex problems are left upon the viewer to figure out. This is the underlying most visited theme of Birdman the tussle between being an actor or being a star. I personally abhor superhero movies, why? Riggan himself said it best- ""Just because it makes billions of dollars doesn't mean it's good, it's a piece of *&!@"". This line was so engraved in my brain that Birdman instantly gained a lot of credibility and respect in my books. Ironically the only superhero movies I really like are Burton-Keaton Batman films and Nolan-Bale Batman films. Birdman not only parodies superhero movies and struggle of an actor trying to breakaway from it all it complements this by providing an excellent support cast with great stories as well. Edward Norton is funny, despicable and yet there are some scenes where I was overwhelmed by how sorry I felt for a man who was dead inside and only felt alive on stage. Emma Stone gives a career best performance but Oscar nomination maybe a bit too much for her.<br/><br/>The biggest and most obvious flaw is that the film has ample slow boring patches which alienate the casual audience (my theater's crowd got especially rowdy) but while alienating the casual audience it is not as cerebral as Gilliam or Lynch or Cronenberg thus even when you interpret and decipher the movie down to its basics you don't feel particularly intelligent after doing so. Further, the fantasy sequences feel a bit out there and are inconsistent with the tone of the movie."

","Birdman has finally hit Indian theatres after a 3 month gap from its US release date. But Birdman is better late than never and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (best known for Babel, Biutiful and Amores Perros) will not only make you happy but also euphoric. Birdman is a long narrative about a famous actor's real world on one side which constantly pushes him to mediocrity and his delusional world on the other side which motivates him to salvage his potential. It's a black comedy which transcends the main character from the movie to a living object, whose dilemma every human can relate to. Riggan, the protagonist plays himself as a once-upon-a-time famous superhero, Birdman, who is trying to organize a Broadway play. In the short journey, he deals with his family, co-workers, critics, financiers and himself to redeem the artist within him. Apart from Michael Keaton's best performance till date, the movie also embraces power packed show by Edward Norton and Zach Galifianakis. Shot extensively inside a studio with constant drum beats on background and theatrical visuals, Birdman is a treat with cherry on top for cinema lovers."

","If you look up the definition of 'meta' in the dictionary, Birdman (the unexpected virtue of ignorance) is the first result.<br/><br/>Everything about the ambitious film Birdman (the unexpected virtue of ignorance) is meticulously thought out and executed flawlessly by the stellar cast and bold crew, especially Alejandro González Iñárritu.<br/><br/>Riggan Thomson, played by Michael Keaton, is a former cinema superhero, box-office juggernaut, and celebrity. In an attempt to revitalize his aging and stagnant career, Riggan funds an ambitious dramatic play that he writes, directs and acts on Broadway. It is a steep risk and gigantic wager but Riggan is grasping at the last vestiges of his career and is desperate to prove his creative legitimacy as an actor, artist and performer. With concerns mounting, namely the recast of a title role to a problematic but enigmatic actor (played by Edward Norton) after the original actor is severely injured, and opening night imminently approaching, Riggan must scramble to maintain control and sanity.<br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu masterful direction of Birdman (the unexpected virtue of ignorance) and grasp of complex content as a commentary on the environment of acting and celebrity shows through in his flawless execution of the film, from start to finish. Iñárritu could not have selected a more challenging and demanding subject for his first mainstream feature film. Iñárritu's formidable undertaking of his creative adaptation and the ideas he chooses to explore parallels to his character Riggan Thomson's venture. Within Birdman, the notions of love versus admiration, celebrity versus artistry, creative legitimacy versus fraudulency, among others are probed substantially.<br/><br/>Birdman is flawlessly executed and conceptualized in every facet. The real life actors playing actors in the film allow their real life personas to be parodied and exploited for creative effect – I especially comment Norton and Keaton. The original score also adds to the surrealist 'play' atmosphere by mimicking an orchestra of the stage rather than a subtly complementary movie score. No dialogue uttered by the characters seems out of place or frivolous, each word dripping with substantiated meaning toward Iñárritu's final intention, each frame of each scene similarly important and purposeful.<br/><br/>Birdman (the unexpected virtue of ignorance) is the type of film that will be talked about and studied in film schools for years to come. Perhaps this will cause some frustration by some viewers – as the film leaves many aspects of the film unanswered and abstract and open for interpretation. The film especially may not be for main stream audiences who are more inclined to see action films where stuff gets blown up rather than the philosophical articulations of Birdman.<br/><br/>Please check out our WEBSITE for full reviews of all the recent releases and award contenders."
"nikashvili","9","2","8","20 January 2015"," Exceptionally original piece of art, with phenomenal cast
","Birdman is a type movie that does not impress until I watch it, because there are films that grab my attention from the very fist teaser. However, it got my heart the moment I finished it and realized how genuinely original and masterfully done it was. <br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu's new film is a story of a washed-up actor Riggan (Michael Keaton), who once played an iconic superhero Birdman and now he has to overcome his ego, family trouble, relationship and reclaim past glory, by directing a Broadway play. Ongoing financial problems make it harder to find a proper lead actor for the play.<br/><br/>First thoughts about Birdman - how crazy it is to cast Keaton, who played Batman in two films, as a widely loved superhero. And especially, when his career was also faded for such a long time. Nevertheless the true masterful acting, it's been a good catch. The same time, Birdman is not an easy movie to review, it's just an experience you should feel by watching the film, because if I start describing what's going on there, you'll never get the enjoyment I had during almost two hours.<br/><br/>But Birdman is brilliant for so many reasons. Let's begin with Keaton who did a performance of his career. He is always in between many layers of his character: sometimes genius, sometimes on the edge of mental breakdown and personal disorder and sometimes a hardworking artist. And he is perfectly introducing all sides of Riggan, who still thinks that he is the superhero once everyone loved.<br/><br/>Birdman, as we may call the alter ego, the past of Riggan, constantly reminds Michael's character that he can easily reclaim past glory, all he needs is to go out, forget everything he does and just become Birdman once again. On the other hand, Riggan, who still believes to be a hero in the bottom of his heart, does not want to give a try, he keeps refusing until a new lead actor Mike (Edward Norton) joins his cast and messes his work up.<br/><br/>Obviously, Riggan has no superpowers, he can not fly or move subjects with his mind, these all, including Birdman, is inside his head. Do not believe any person telling that all these are real. Two simple fact from film witness that it's just an imagination. First, when Riggan is alone in the room, camera shows that he moves objects without a physical connection and the moment anyone comes in, that person sees how Riggan actually throws those objects. Second, after the ""flying"" scene, we see a taxi driver who chases Keaton's character asking why he did not pay for the service. It means, he never flew, he just draw a cab.<br/><br/>Speaking about flying scene, once again, great job Emmanuel Lubezki, whose camera work just made every scene unbelievably enjoyable. Especially, the one, where Riggan believes he flies through New York skyscrapers. But honestly, every other scene had a great beauty in it. The stage scenes, with thunderstorms is a great example of perfect work with lights.<br/><br/>The rest of Oscar and SAG nominee cast is no less good as lead. Edward Norton as an eccentric actor, who tries to get the control over play, is amazing, entertaining and witty. His scenes are so dynamic, weird and funny. So is Emma Stone, who is my favorite in this film. Her portrayal of Riggan's troubled daughter Sam is the best job she's done so far.<br/><br/>Truly best part of Birdman is the job Iñárritu did for this film, both directing and writing. The idea itself is beyond originality. Story as a whole is wonderful focusing on so many things, while dialogues, character and scenes are both complex and interesting. He as a director managed to craft a movie that will make you think and enjoy your movie going experience. I don't think any other person could do it better to show what is going in the mind of main character. Birdman has also one of the best endings I've seen so far. The scene where Sam looks up in the window and smiles, as if she saw her father.<br/><br/>A lot discussions have been about this controversial ending. Even director was asked and he obviously left the question open for interpretation. One definite thing we can say is that, Riggan did not fly, so Sam did not see him in the air. It would be just out of logic. Alejandro used ""flying"" as an metaphor of freedom, of chasing dreams, of doing whatever you want. Everything about superhero Birdman was an indication of personal liberty, escaping from reality that killed, consumed Riggan. Having said that, final scene should be interpreted that he finally did what he wanted to to, broke out and reclaimed the freedom.<br/><br/>But how did he do it? If we consider that he disappeared from window, then it might mean he killed himself. This idea would be true if we remember the stage scene where Riggan, by mistake (?) shoots a gun, in nose. So, if he committed a suicide, why is Sam smiling? Metaphorically, this should mean that finally, she was seeing her father as he always saw himself and wanted other to see: important, still strong, beloved and a person who matters. <br/><br/>So, I more go with suicide, because disappearing from the window can not be imaginary, but imaginary is what happens later: Sam first looks down, and sees her father dead, then looks up to show that she finally got Riggan the way he always wanted to be perceived.<br/><br/>In conclusions, Birdman is one of the best works this year in every sense. It succeeds to create an interesting story, being perfectly acted, directed and written."

","A lot of people are referring to this movie as 'the dressing-up of the mundane'. Twice as many are referring to it as a 'cinematic masterpiece' way beyond it's time. I'm not sure I agree with either.<br/><br/>Whilst you definitely get the impression this movie isn't conventional, I think maybe it tries too hard to achieve this 'profound uniqueness'. However, I don't see this as a flaw; this is how cinema progresses. So, the jellyfish scene doesn't make sense to you, maybe you don't understand who or what Birdman is - but that is what makes the movie interesting. If you don't see this film as more than the production of a Broadway show, you need to watch it again.<br/><br/>I think a lot of both the criticisms and praises for Birdman center around it's use of confusing and nonsensical scenes. To me, it's all about interpretation; this movie doesn't guide you through the narrative, it doesn't tell you what means what and who is who, you need to figure it out for yourself. Your understanding of the movie doesn't need to match someone else's, because this is a film that you can make your own, which is a very unique quality that many films lack.<br/><br/>Ignoring the plot, the cast of Birdman can truly be considered the stars of the show. Michael Keaton performs the best role of his career, Riggan, a middle aged washed out actor looking for a comeback. His desperation and persistence is something we can all admire and relate to, and, paired with other stars, including Edward Norton, an egotistical actor, and Emma Stone, Riggans daughter, the cast of Birdman exceeds itself on acting ability and well-established characters.<br/><br/>As long as you watch this with an open-mind, I think it's a genuinely enjoyable, definitely comedic, somewhat thought provoking and all round fun movie. 8/10"
"JosephPezzuto","8","2","8","12 January 2015"," Reel Look: 'Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)'
","""A thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing."" So reads a note on Riggan's dressing room mirror. Mexican film director Alejandro González Iñárritu (Amores Perros, Babel) takes to the skies as a prominent director with his unique, albeit ambitious, American black comedy 'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue on Ignorance)'. Full of outstanding performances and an original look into the lives of a handful of misfits looking for their niche in the limelight, our primary focus is our main character Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), a faded Hollywood actor yearning for one last break to get his name-to-fame on the stage despite whatever it takes to do so for his career to once again to take off into the blue. We literally are tapped into Riggan's psyche as he is mentally tortured by the voice of Birdman. He criticizes Riggan about the high-flying successes of his past to the mediocre now of his forgotten name. Riggan also imagines himself performing feats of levitation and telekinesis, only to remind himself of who he once was, all the while hindering himself because of his new career keeps him on the ground rather than from soaring above the crowds into the clear blue sky where he once belonged rather than being spat from it onto an unhappy stage. Famous for playing the superhero decades earlier on film, he now stars in a play he has rewritten, directed and stars in himself, in a Broadway adaptation based off of Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" at the St. James Theater in New York City. The play is produced by Thomson's best friend and lawyer Jake (Zach Galifianakis) and also stars Riggan's girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough) and first-time Broadway actress Lesley (Naomi Watts). Serving as his assailant is his daughter Sam (Emma Stone), a recovering marijuana addict. With all that said, what is it that truly makes 'Birdman' soar? Let's take a look.<br/><br/>When Riggan hires the brilliant but volatile method actor Michael Shiner (Edward Norton), he later regrets it due to him getting all the attention now. During a preview, Riggan performs the final scene of the play, in which his character laments in ""not existing"" and shoots himself as the audience applauds and the curtain closes. After the performance, Mike tells Riggan he needs to find a more realistic prop gun. After some time, Michael starts getting more and more attention as Riggan feels that his name will soon forever be erased from the memories who used to cheer him on as their fearless feathered hero. And to worsen matters as they already are, local top theater critic Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncun) threatens Riggan with writing the worst review for his production to stop his shows altogether, saying he fails at being a true artist of the theater and the stage. To prove her wrong with one final act to get his name cemented into publicity for certain, he does the unthinkable in the last scene of the act for the ultimate performance, as what Dickinson later credited in her review as super-realism and for Riggan to personally gain back the self-confidence and redemption he truly yearned for all along.<br/><br/>With brilliant strokes composed to the film as compared to a brush, Iñárritu allows the film and its viewers to glide along with it as well, as the camera paints its way around as would a bird hovering in midair with incredibly smooth cinematography composed by Emmanuel Lubezki. The camera-work and editing of 'Birdman' were manipulated to give the appearance that most of the film is one continuous long take, as if we were on the back of an invisible avian voyeur. Another important touch is Mexican jazz drum soloist Antonio Sánchez providing the throbbing, rapid beats that sporadically pervade the soundtrack and keeps the tempo of the film moving. Nominated for seven Golden Globe awards at the 72nd ceremony with Keaton winning Best Actor, 'Birdman' was perfectly cast, flawlessly shot and, as for all of its originality, is truly unafraid in soaring to new heights."

It pushes our ideals and look on the world that we have come to live in today.It pushes how we see our dreams and desires and just how far we are willing to take them. <br/><br/>In today's film world we see that the superhero genre is growing with films like Man of Steel, The Dark Knight, and The Avengers, but we can't help but ask ourselves do these characters, actors, directors have anything for themselves outside of just being the big superhero beat em up movies that they are. Well Birdman or the unexpected virtue of ignorance puts this question down on a silver platter and begins to ask these mind numbing questions that must be asked. <br/><br/>We see Michael Keaton take on the role of an actor gone mad after leaving his franchise known as Birdman. He has started to see things now look at strange images in the mirror along with hearing voices as well of his former self. He tries to discredit the voices as he pushes himself to become a true artist on the stage. he takes a huge risk much like the director does with this story. He tries to tell a emotional story on the stage of a man as he desires nothing more than to shock his audience soo much. He goes through rehearsal after rehearsal trying to get his audience to enjoy what was going on while he was on the stage. The actor also deals with his daughter who feels he is washed up and finished as an actor and makes fun of him for trying so hard.<br/><br/>When real blood is thrown on the stage then the stakes go high and the film has now gained a new dimension and has shown us just how far a person can go for art!<br/><br/>The actors are truly what helps make this movie really work well as Michael as Emma Stone put on the stealer performances that help hold the movie together while Naomi Watts helps build the structure. However neither Naomi Watts nor Emma stone ever take the spotlight off Keaton at any point and help make the movie feel well rounded.<br/><br/>Now what is stopping this from being 10/10 well while this movie is defiantly gonna win a Oscar it still has some hurdles. For instance the lesbian scenes and side story with Emma Stone was dry cut and never went anywhere aside from giving the audience loads of fan service to watch. Which is fine I just believe in having some balance in fan service, but I am not going complain to much. Though I wish there was more to this than what we got. <br/><br/>Either way Birdman is a amazing film that you should get everyone seeing you know."

","A washed-up actor who once played an iconic superhero (Michael Keaton) must overcome his ego and family trouble as he mounts a Broadway play in a bid to reclaim his past glory.<br/><br/>All the hype said this was an Oscar contender for Best Picture, as well as for Best Actor. As of now, the film has walked away with two Golden Globes: Best Screenplay and Best Actor. The former seems fair enough, but the latter is misguided. Keaton, while good, never seems to go outside his comfortable range, while Bill Murray in ""St. Vincent"" blew Keaton out of the water.<br/><br/>This is still a great film from a technical standpoint, with credit going to the editors and the cinematographer. And the acting is certainly not bad (though Emma Stone seemed out of play). But the praise Keaton is receiving seems out of place, and exaggerated."
"gracebryson","10","2","9","3 February 2015"," Ingenious
","Once you get over the immediate shock and confusion the movie brings, your understand how cleverly it is all done. The story line is confusing and even if you don't quite like the storyline there is no denying the beautiful direction and emotional acting. The directing creates tension like no movie has before as the camera follows the characters through the movie. The contrast of light hearted humor and deep emotions is nothing short of genius. Emma Stone shows a side of her skills we haven't yet seen as she plays a dark character who is sort of creepy. Michael Keeton also very well portrays a crazy man, and his external emotions reflect the confused feelings he has inside. All of the actors are brilliant however I feel Ed Norton stands out as always, he is creepy and mean all with an emotional side and acting you can't watch with a closed mouth. Overall I would say even if it doesn't seem appealing to you, it is impossible to deny how well made and magnificent the movie is, definitely go and see it."

","Birdman is a fascinating movie. Even if you don't understand everything about it (like the ending for example), you can still call the movie a masterpiece. I know that because I am one of those people. I'm not going to talk about the ending because I don't fully understand it. To figure that out would require a second watch, and that is not currently possible for me right now. Anyways, nearly everything about this movie is flawless. It's edited to look as if it was done in one shot and that freaking blew my mind. I honestly could not tell where the cuts were. It looked as if the camera never stopped rolling. That in itself is an achievement on its own, but Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu takes it another step. There is actually a point to filming this movie like this. The film is about Michael Keaton's character making a play, so it makes sense to make the movie look and feel like a play. Major props that for that call. The direction is incredible of course. This man managed to make a movie look like one shot. It that isn't freaking awesome, then I don't know what is. Everyone in this movie gives a magnificent performance. Everyone from Michael Keaton, to Emma Stone, to Zach Galifianakis of all people, give Oscar worthy performances. Even the special effects are really well done. There isn't many of them, but the ones that were present were handled with exceptional care and looked very realistic. On top of all that, the film has a script that is both funny and intelligent. It has a lot to say about the state of Hollywood, big blockbuster films, and critics. It's nice to see there was a point to this movie. Last thing is the drum score. Now granted I'm not entirely sure what the point of it was (I have a theory, but I don't feel like talking about it), but it sounded so cool that I had to mention it. Whoever played those drums kicks serious ass. I've named all the positives and I actually have no issues with this film. I cannot recommend this movie more. See it in the theater if you can."
"Anurag-Shetty","10","2","9","31 January 2015"," The most unique & unconventional movie I've ever watched.
","Birdman tells the story of Riggan(Michael Keaton), who is a washed up actor. Riggan is mostly known for playing an iconic superhero called Birdman. However, when he stopped acting in Birdman films many years ago, people didn't really care about him anymore & he stopped being relevant. Now, Riggan mounts a Broadway play in a bid to reclaim his former glory. However, Riggan will have to overcome several issues in his life & the play to make sure his first stint on Broadway is successful. <br/><br/>Birdman is a spectacular film. It is completely different from any other movie I've seen before. Particularly, because of the way the film has been shot. The movie has been shot in one long take. There is no transition from one scene to the next. The entire movie takes place continuously. This is the next achievement in movie making. Kudos to director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu for using this new & awesome technique. Birdman is a complete entertainer. It has elements of comedy, drama & in one brilliant set piece, we even get to see Birdman in action. The cast is flawless. They deserve their award for Best Acting Ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Riggan. Keaton effortlessly showcases a variety of emotions as the troubled Riggan. He deserves all the awards & praise that's coming his way. Zach Galifianakis is great as Jake. Edward Norton is hysterical as Mike. Norton deserves all his award nominations. Andrea Riseborough is impressive as Laura. Amy Ryan is amazing as Sylvia. Emma Stone is brilliant as Sam. Stone plays against type & gives the performance of a lifetime. Stone deserves all her award nominations. Naomi Watts is good as Lesley. Birdman is an instant classic & an achievement in modern movie making. No wonder it's one of the lead contenders to win Best Film at the Oscars. Do not miss it!"

","First of all I have to mention that I have never done a review and that I'm not a native English speaking person. <br/><br/>I don't really know how to start with Birdman. I have watched many movies in my life but none of them is like Birdman. Birdman is extraordinary in every aspect. <br/><br/>Birdman is shot to look like a one-take which is amazing executed but feels extremely exhausting. Not that it is boring in any way but in my case I just couldn't blink because I'm used to blink when the transition appears. <br/><br/>The acting is perfect, Michael Keaton gives the performance of his career(he is perfect for this role). Edward Norton is kicking ass in every single scene he is in and everybody else including Zach Galifianakis were beautiful. Every character is beautifully written and acted. <br/><br/>Birdman is about this washed up comic book actor who tries to make this play so everybody ""likes"" him again. But it's not only about this play it's about the relation ship between Riggion (Michael Keaton)and his daughter Sam(Emma Stone), his ex-wife, his girlfriend and the relation ships between the actors.<br/><br/>Birdman is a film that comments on so many things like movie making and ""special effects"" the ""critics"" and their ""I don't like it because ""I"" think it was stupid"" opinions it's about oneself and ones place in this world. <br/><br/>When I got out of Birdman I didn't know what to think of Birdman. It is a very deep story that leaves you thinking about the movie and now after a while I know that I loved everything about Birdman and it is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. I recommend it thoroughly."
"vistheindian","9","2","9","26 January 2015"," Nanananana Birdman!
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Riggan (Michael Keaton) was once an iconic movie superhero, Birdman. He desperately attempts to revive his career by adapting, directing, and acting in his own Broadway play. In the days leading up to the opening night not only does he face the doubts brought on by the people in his life, but he also comes to terms with the reality that he is now a has-been, a washed up actor. Birdman is one of the most beautifully directed films of 2014. On top of that the film is brimming with impeccable acting talent, grabbing your attention with every line of the flawless script. Coincidentally, just as Riggan attempts writing, directing, and acting, Birdman achieves this perfect trifecta that delivers a truly unique look into the mind of an actor.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>Once again an Oscar film had a delayed release where I live. I have been aching to see this movie for a long time, even before all the award nominations. Now that I have finally seen it, I can happily say it was well worth the wait.<br/><br/>When it comes to casting many people talk about whether the actor is the right fit for the role. A former superhero who is past the prime years of his career... hmm seems oddly familiar Mr. Keaton. Whoever did the casting, give them a bonus because this was a stroke of genius! It is clearly evident that Keaton drew from his own life experience of being Batman of the early 90's. Simultaneously it never felt forced as if we were just watching another version of Michael Keaton. Rather he used that experience to further flesh out the character of Riggan. He is constantly battling the ideas of either pursuing his passion of being an artist or feeding his ego of being a celebrity. Keaton does a great job of presenting this inner turmoil though a dual personality, so it does delve into some strange territory but captivating nonetheless. There is absolutely not a single weak link in the cast, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough, even Zach Galifianakis of the Hangover fame brings his best dramatic chops yet. However, the standout from the supporting cast for me has to be Edward Norton. His character is an arrogant and pretentious method actor. He brought this uncertainty in his character's intent that kept both the characters in the film and the audience on their toes.<br/><br/>As great as it was to see these actors perform, what blew me away was the cinematography and direction of Iñárritu. The entire film is made to look like a single long take, similar to the iconic Copacabana scene from The Goodfellas, or more recently the opening scene of Gravity. The fact that the film is a series of these seamlessly connected long takes is amazingly ambitious. If done wrong there could've been a plethora of problems ranging from mishandled characters to forced dialog. Instead this creative decision added to the flow and rhythm of the film, continuously building the momentum of the story from one character interaction to another.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film enough. It is almost perfect in every aspect of filmmaking, while at the same time daring to try new styles to great effect. It's not just a film, it's a cinematic experience. Watching the solid cast members work off each other is a delight. Once again, this a movie that deserves all the nominations it has been getting, and I know it's my frontrunner for some of the categories.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"
"willcundallreview","10","2","9","25 January 2015"," Movies like this are special
","Rating-10/10<br/><br/>Birdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a movie that represents the true power of cinema and truly shows that in this era we live in, film is alive and well. This masterpiece really did do the job you want from film and the story and acting and cinematography among other things, are just perfection and it has been a long time since a black comedy has really come close to absolute flawlessness.<br/><br/>One major point about this movie is Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson (and Birdman) and his performance here really typifies what acting can do to us the viewer as we feel not only his emotions but also the true power great acting is. The cast is to be fair absolute excellence alongside Keaton and people like Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts create such a display I felt this movie is one to watch for aspiring actors because they create emotion and depth in the they're portrayals. <br/><br/>I felt the comedy side flowed beautifully as well and although coming into the cinema screen I did feel almost like this would be overrated in terms of laughter, I was sorely mistaken. The word black comedy is thrown as a label on many movies these days but this is what I call true black comedy and even the appearance of Zach Galifianakis as Riggan's lawyer Jake just adds to the overall humour we see and manages to be a rare film in which funny parts are mixed with dramatic brilliance.<br/><br/>What else can be said about Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu other than this man creates a movie which far surpasses anything I thought this would be like. He masterfully directs and at times it seems so simple yet not thought of and Inarritu locates what inside we really want from a movie like this. He alongside others write a script that is pure gold in the eyes of not only actors and directors but also for critics and it feels almost impossible to criticise this movie, even with a slightly slow beginning. <br/><br/>The cinematography just adds to everything I have said and complimented and although it may seem a stupid arsty move with the continuous shot, It just lets you delve in to the action and really not only makes you feel your there, but it also brings a certain reality to fictional characters who by the end you actually start to care and feel about. Emmanuel Lubezski at the time of writing this review is at the top of his game still and whatever he does in the future, it can be assured with movies like this that he will always have a part in academy award winning film.<br/><br/>Don't go into this thinking ""Oh it is looks too dull"" or as if only critics like this type of movie because this movie is a force and the powerful performances can just light a spark in your eyes and it bursts into life. I think for many this truly raises questions about the quality of movies especially in Hollywood and how something like this can just point out where in the last maybe decade, CGI and big budgets have over taken true cinema storytelling made by people who seem to care.<br/><br/>I think with my grade of 10/10 it means I just felt this was perfection, and if this was truly a piece of school or university work then I would have no choice but to declare this astounding. Although my review seems kind of a bit crazy and over the top, the movie will make you feel alive again in my opinion and people like Keaton who is so underrated in the world of Filmography stick in your mind and the formula of this is just comedy and drama and fine acting boiled up into a fine fine movie that in truth should be classed as an epic for future generations as we maybe see such films as On the Waterfront or Citizen Kane today."
"supergeneration16","8","2","9","20 January 2015"," Truly an 'Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance'
","Well not all critically acclaimed film is good and this film proved it right.<br/><br/>Being a nominee for 9 Oscar and is one of the most criticized film of the year, Birdman proved that film shouldn't be that long to state its point to the audience. Yes the acting was great, but it so DAMN LONG!!! And this is the only negative side of the film, though the rest of it is awesome. <br/><br/>The playing drums throughout some scenes of the movie showed something unique about this film and that's what I've loved about it - Uniqueness. The other awesome part of this film is its cinematography and directing. Alejandro surely directed this film seriously, that continuous frame and acting are perfectly harmonized and complemented the film perfectly. And partnered by 'also' perfect cinematography is sure blast. <br/><br/>The story was not that great, however it is complex - Complex in terms of that you must think it deeply. The screenplay, on the other hand, is pristine, because what you're seeing is the product of that writing and it is awesome!<br/><br/>So, I gave it 8/10. For that package. <br/><br/>It has its flaws, but it is worth it."

","I don't know that I've seen a film that has me ""on the fence"" more than Birdman...I get it, I really do...I get that the theater was his mind, that the characters were all in Keaton's perception, and the drums were literal symbols...the main problem was, I didn't like it. I kept feeling like there was some sort of culmination to this film that never delivered--that it was all a biographical commentary on Keaton's own life, that there was a commentary on the role of criticism, that it was a satire of superhero films (and those that love them), and I guess, to some extent, all of that was there...But none of it, at least in my humble opinion was done well. The drumming was incessant and, again, in my opinion, annoying. The problem with a film like this and its review is that people will see it as ""arty"" and feel superior if they like it, so if you don't, then you're clearly not smart enough for it. My wife's main issue was that there was no one to root for in this film--I think that's harsh. Emma Stone's character was likable, and to some extent, so was Edward Norton's...but still, I can well understand the guy who said he left after 12 minutes..."

"bryden2000","10","2","9","15 January 2015"," 1 continuous shot?
","Why would anyone make a movie that looks like 1 continuous shot? Good question, my favorite continuous shot in film history (prior to this film) was the famous goodfellas scene where he enters the restraint through the back, but when I watched this film at the theaters I was amazed at how they used it to their advantage. Thogh, the cinematography of the film is very distracting at times it made the movie beautiful to view. The drum score behind the film made it even more extravagant, I loved the music so much I stayed in the theater during the credits just to listen to it. Ever since batman, Micheal Keating career has been going downhill, nowadays he is a washed up actor and the last film he made he directed himself (similarly to what he does in this film). Starring Edward Norton in his best performance since primal fear and American history X. I love Zach galfinakis, between two ferns is hilarious, and him being a comic made me nervous about watching him in a serious role, he owned this role, this movie made me appreciate Zach as an actor rather than a comic. Up until one point of the movie, no cuts were used, but almost at the end several edits were made and ruined the continuous feel of the movie, which made me appreciate it a little less. As much as I love what the director of photography did, I wouldn't like to see anymore films made this way.i hope this wins best cinematography, best screenplay and best actor at the Oscars, and as much as I'd love to see it win best picture, I know boyhood it the favorite at the moment. And I know for a fact that there's no chance it'll win best film editing."

"buddhalou","10","2","9","14 January 2015"," Birdman is Brilliant.
","Brilliance wrapped in bacon and more brilliance. While I have yet to see a couple of the big contenders - 'Selma' and 'Theory of Everything', namely - this is far and away the best film of the ones I have seen and I don't see that changing. It garnered seven Globe nominations for good reason (the most of any film) and it should pick up even more nominations for the Oscars (I'm betting on 10) in categories the Globes don't give awards for. The problem for offbeat, dark comedies like this one, come Golden Globes time, is that it blurs the line between drama and comedy so effectively that it loses out to more straightforward dramas and comedies like this years winners, 'Boyhood' and 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', respectively. The Academy does not make this distinction and, while the odds-makers are saying otherwise, I have a gut feeling that they're going to get it right and Birdman is going to take home the Oscar for Best Picture. As it did for the Globes, it should win for Best Original Screenplay, but I'm not sure if Keaton is going to take home another win for Best Actor. I'm very much hoping it wins for two of the things that made this movie magical for me - Cinematography and Best Original Score. Chances are that the Oscar for the Best Score will go to something a little more traditional, but the jazz percussion score of Birdman not only served as a brilliant tempo track, but felt like another character at times. If it doesn't win for Best Cinematography it will be a clear sign to me that there is no god, all humans are stupid and the end times are nigh. The lighting design was amazing for its contributions towards moving between, confusing and combining the dual world of stage and screen in this flick and oh the entire film was, essentially, a tracking shot (albeit carried out with effects and hidden cuts for some of the transitions) but that is why it should at least get a nomination for Visual Effects and maybe even the win. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Emma Stone and Edward Norton for the much deserved nominations they'll probably receive for their supporting roles, although they likely won't win. All in all, I predict that Birdman will receive the most nominations at this year's Academy Awards, but will only walk away with two or three statues. I hope I'm wrong and it runs the table, but it's just not the kind of film that the Academy tends to fawn over. All good, though this flick is WAY up on my list of favorites and I look forward to regular, repeated viewings over the years to come. Absolutely phenomenal film. I can't wait for the day's responsibilities and obligations to be done with so I can watch it again."

"rddj05","9","2","9","10 January 2015"," Outstanding Film. Not for the Transformers Crowd.
","Outstanding film. I thought Birdman was a complete breath of fresh air, and not what I was expecting at all...in a good way. <br/><br/>I will say this: If you saw the trailer, and are somehow expecting this film to be a version of Transformers, it won't be. <br/><br/>But if you're looking for a film with some of the best writing of the year, amazing camera work that totally absorbs you (20-minute non- stop takes following the actors through the scenes), a film with an almost perfect blend of humor and drama, and one in which, within 5 minutes of it's opening, proves itself so charmingly odd and unpredictable, that you're not quite sure what will happen next...than this film may be for you. <br/><br/>Birdman skewers everything that's wrong with celebrity culture and Hollywood, while in many ways, embracing what can be great about it. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton (who has been off the Hollywood radar for quite some time) is perfectly cast as a former movie star, who is well known for the ""Birdman"" movie franchise that was a series of hugely popular comic books films 25 years earlier. (Not all that dissimilar from the Batman franchise the real-life Keaton starred in 25 years ago). <br/><br/>Keaton's character, Riggan, is trying to resurrect his career, but as a serious actor, by directing and starring in a Broadway play. Pulling of this feat, will have numerous barriers, including him taking on a difficult role that many may not accept him in, a co-star lover, and, most hilariously, a narcissistic, unpredictable co-star (played Ed Norton), that seems to be trying to sabotage the production at every turn, if it means staying true to himself.<br/><br/>Riggan is an actor who is desperate not to be forgotten. He needs to feel important again. His character taps into the self-loathing attitude and the need to believe that he is special, that we all feel, all while he is haunted by the voice of his alter-ego, the Birdman, who taunts him that he is a fraud who is making a huge mistake.<br/><br/>Is Birdman light on plot? To an extent. Although I would say the plot revolves around an aging Hollywood movie star trying to pull off a hugely expensive Broadway show, without losing millions of dollars of investors money, all to see if he can salvage his career, and hence his reason for living. <br/><br/>But even if some do feel it's light on plot, who cares? It's a completely engrossing film that follows interesting characters, played by actors who are compelling to watch. That's about you can ask for in a film."
"dyllon_jeng","8","2","9","3 January 2015"," Not for a certain type of viewer but still great
","If you're looking for a movie with complex plot or an extremely original concept or conflict, this is not the movie for you. But what it lacks in it makes up for with great acting performances, genius cinematography, and poignant character development. To sum it up, it's a movie about a man's insecurity and how those around him are affected. I would hardly consider it a comedy, since it's mostly a drama with few instances of comic relief. And as mentioned earlier, there's no original concept or plot that makes the movie stand out. So don't go into the theater expecting a straightforward story line or much amusement. Birdman is solely a look at the life of a struggling actor who must deal with so many insecurities in his life and overcome them.In a way, it's a lot like Taxi Driver in a certain way, in case you've watched that movie as well. I have a feeling that those who have watched the film either really liked it or absolutely hated it. I guess I'm one of the few who are in between but still enjoyed the movie."

","""Birdman"" is such a hard movie to describe. I honestly don't know where to start. It's one of those films that doesn't fit into any one genre (or any two for that matter) and its wide array of interesting characters can't be easily summed up. But, that may be the reason why the film is so absorbing. It has so many original qualities that certainly don't fit into the standard mold of what a star-studded movie should be, instead putting a strange (but fascinating) spin on your typical drama.<br/><br/>Set in the heart of New York City, it focuses on Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), a washed-up actor who gained fame for his role as the iconic superhero Birdman. Trying to overcome his ego 12 years later, he adapts and stars in his own Broadway play hoping to reclaim his spot as an important actor. We see the ups and downs of this production along with the odd way his psyche works, his inner voice being the Birdman character.<br/><br/>There's also many other facets, including the quarrels between Keaton and Edward Norton's character (one of the main stars of the play), all equally entertaining. The writing is top-notch, serving up witty and funny moments throughout, and each member of the cast delivers a fantastic performance (my favorite being Norton). It also includes a brilliant musical score, entirely done with drums. And despite its flaws, mostly in a few goofy moments, it isn't one to miss. The concept alone is remarkable and the execution isn't far off, give this one a watch, it will be one of the standouts in the upcoming awards season."

But to me this film is totally aware of its own pretentiousness so I'm not really mad about it.<br/><br/>It's about a Hollywood actor that needs validation as an artist. That's not a groundbreaking story but the narrative touches on valid subjects about the show business, the people around it and it's audience.<br/><br/>The way it was shot is very cool, the acting is fantastic.

","Birdman tells the story of Riggan Thomson, an actor looking to revive his flagging career by producing, writing and starring in a Broadway show, hoping to recapture some of the fame and success afforded to him in past by playing superhero 'Birdman'.<br/><br/>The story was really gripping, and the character of Riggan deep and interesting. Its no wonder Birdman won Best Original Screenplay. It's a truly unique and clever story told in a wonderfully inventive, humorous, dark and sombre way. A large part of this was down to the characters, who were so well thought out and put together. Birdman gave us a peak behind the curtain of Broadway and the souls that take to the stage, at times giving highly satirical portrayals of a stereotypical Broadway performer. The way that they all interacted was fascinating, with the script so sharp and the acting always on point. The more comedic elements of the film always hit the mark, with all of the characters and cast contributing to this.<br/><br/>Birdman has such a great ensemble cast, any of whom could have been awarded an Oscar for their performance. Not a foot put wrong in the whole cast. Keaton, Stone and Norton were all fantastic, all giving very varied performances which kept you on your toes. Zack Galifianakis was great in a serious capacity, and Naomi Watts also delivered a great supporting performance. If you need any convincing watching Birdman, the acting alone is worth it.<br/><br/>What really stands out for me is the camera work and direction. The shots tracking through the theatre was so intriguing, bringing Broadway to life in a thoroughly unique way. Inarittu mapped out the environment of the theatre so cleverly with the choice to film this as a one shot. This was used to great effect in showing the relentlessness of the pressure that was being exerted on Riggan, both by himself and by the stress of launching a Broadway show. There was no let up as we felt like we were living in the moment with Riggan and the rest of the cast. The direction reflected this perfectly and cultivated an atmosphere of anxiety and desperation that was breathing down on the characters as well as us as an audience.
.
Simply put Birdman is fantastic. You can tell that so much care was put into this film from everybody involved. It delivers everything you could want from a film and will keep you most entertained for 2 hours."

It also speaks well to anyone who has aspirations and how those aspirations affect you and the people around you. Yes, there was redundancy in the movie but so is there in life. Very few people in life learn or adapt from a single experience. We often fail again and again even when we are doing things right.

","First time I watched it was when I was 14 and honestly I thought it would be another super hero movie. I gave it 2/5 and at that time I wasn't really into movies, I just basically watched superhero movies with my friends. I was so wrong about this film and I'm angry at myself for not revisiting it earlier.<br/><br/>Birdman is one of the best character studies and definitely a techincal achievement. It critizices current state of cinema in which superhero movies earn all the money and essentially the audience (me at that period) who only care about superhero movies. It critizices movie and theatre critics who don't care about people behind the movie, critics who make up their mind before they've even watched the movie, critics who don't know what to write so they write random quotes.<br/><br/>Honestly, I prefer Birdman's one take over 1917's onetake simply because I find it more effective here. I particularly love the shots when there is mirror in shot and Lubezki's cinematography is impeccable.<br/><br/>In the end, this is all about our main character Riggan, how he strives to get back into movie industry and not become another name in the crossword, how he wants to create his legacy and leave something important behind.

Keaton is in his S-game, somehow being able to dig out the deepest emotions from audiences, yet also able to tone it down when certain scenes of him being outperformed by Edward Norton's character are playing. Edward Norton's emotional mess of a character serves as a counterbalance to Emma Stone's explosive emotional mess. The dynamics between all characters are all interesting and compelling, and oh my God this is only just the three main leads.<br/><br/>On the technical aspect, this is a film with cinematography so great and editing so sharp that the film is perhaps the reason I began to overanalyse filmmaking technicalities. The long takes, tricky shots and seamless transitions are straight up mind-boggling. Couple that with the amazing percussion-driven score, and what you get is truly a film that has a life of its own. The plot explores a pretty commonly-done theme, however the script here is organic and downright relatable.

"maxigarciasoto","10","1","3","14 February 2018"," Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) - Movie review
","""Birdman"" is a film written and directed by Alejandro G. Iñarritu, which is in my opinion one of the best mexican directors of all time. This film is about an actor called Riggan (Michael Keaton) who is very famous for the role of a superhero called Birman that he portrayed back in 1992. But now in today's times we get to see this actor in the lowest point of his career, and during this point of his life he is involved in a theater acting in a play, and the film is about how he has to move foward this project along to get everything working.<br/><br/>I going to be honest here, the first time i watched this film was back in 2014, i saw this film in theaters. I was younger back then and my first reaction to this film was: I like this film, is an enjoyable watch. But yesterday my brain said to me (i don't now why): Hey Max, maybe you should watch ""Birdman"" again. So i watched this film again last night, and oh my god...I cannot believe that when i saw this film the first time, i said: Is a good movie. The only word that i can describe this film is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>This kind of films are not make as usual as some people may think, ""Birdman"" is a film that is very simple and so original. This entire film is just one take, i don't know how they edited this movie. I mean, there are parts of the movie where we see characters walking into dark rooms and you can say: Thats were they cut that scene - but in this film it feels unnoticeable, and it also makes you wander what is going to happen next, makes it unpredictable, and it works at second viewing. The cinematography here is amazing, Emmanuel Lubezki is a master at what he does. The performances in this film are all fantastic, Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, all the performances were impeccable. This movie also features a very simple score, that is just made almost entirely with drums. <br/><br/>All things make ""Birman"" a great movie, but the thing that i'm not going to forget about his film is that it also talks about movies, blockbusters, reviews or critics, parent issues, movie roles, actors. This film is also very philosophical in that aspect and i loved it, and it was easily my favorite part of this movie.<br/><br/>Guys, in the end, ""Birman"" is a cinematic masterpiece, is a movie that to be really appreciated you have to see the little messages that are hidden beneath the surface, and if you catch them all, this movie will be unforgettable for you. See this film, is you are a film lover, this movie will blown your mind with amazing cinematography, great performances, incredible direction, and an amazing script. I love every second of this film and this film totally deserves a 10/10."

"punkd_rapha","10","1","3","30 October 2017"," A virtual theatrical experience
","Every now and then a film will perfectly illustrate an art form not yet showcased on screen. For example, Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan for dancers or Damien Chazelle's Whiplash for musicians, and now Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Birdman for actors. The seamlessly visceral one-take wonder is what made this project immediately a unique experience. Now, of course, there are obvious spots that do suggests cuts have been made but it never detaches you from the action. It flows fluidly, always shifting gears at every corner, making this an organic and lively watch, almost as if you were witnessing a theatrical performance. <br/><br/>We begin with our lead character Riggan, played by Michael Keaton, levitating off the ground in his dressing room in a meditative pose. This already suggests it isn't going to be an ordinary flick with formulaic characters. From there, the camera weaves along, flowing from scene to scene aqueously without any pause as the score presents itself in the form of beats, as if the drummer was improvising the whole picture. Each character is then presented, as wacky and fresh as the next, perfectly acted from a star studded cast, in particular Edward Norton who steals almost every scene. <br/><br/>But let me make this clear, this is Michael Keaton's movie, almost in a literal sense, playing an aged out actor who once was a Hollywood star that donned the famous Birdman suit (Can you see the correlation here?) Now, no longer a household name and only remembered by an older generation, he tries to make a comeback in a bold way, by adapting, directing and performing in his own stage production that could break the chains and make him into the artist he's always aspired to be. Keaton puts on a mesmerising performance that is as moving as Inurratu's camera-work, showing a plethora of emotions that will encapsulate your own. <br/><br/>This movie serves up everything you'd want out of it in a silver platter. It is groundbreaking, almost to the point of being pure magic. It's a theatrical moving picture that reinvents the definition of cinema and why we need it so much."

","This movie was an interesting story that blended art and reality together in a weird, yet realistic way. Parts of the movie felt a little disconnected from the audience (i.e. Birdman's unrealistic powers), but for some reason that disconnection left us feeling like we craved a deeper connection. And even though we couldn't relate to a superhero, we could relate to his very real life and the events in it. The movie takes its viewer on an emotional roller coaster as each scene further drives and intensifies the plot. I feel like there is a lot to learn from this movie and will definitely be re-watching it as I continually study the art of film."

"ElMaruecan82","9","1","3","8 May 2017"," Emotionally Volatile and Bizarre Masterpiece...
","Either ""Birdman"" is too simple but tries to make its nervous directing and real-time editing pass for intellectual complexity or if it really flies over these considerations with the insolent confidence of a real birdman. Well, I'm not sure the film is as original as it intended to be, but the treatment is one of a kind and maybe one of these cases where the form and the content redeem each other and contribute to one of these puzzling experiences that look too good not to be intentionally made to impress you, yet the result is so efficient that you almost feel guilty to fall for it.<br/><br/>Again, Inarritu displays some infuriating wizardry, using long takes and transitions from scene to scene, that are nonexistent so that in the end, you have the confusing impression to have endured in less than two hours, a dizzying and mind-bending three-day journey swinging between arguments, confessions, improvisations, outbursts of anger, passions, feelings, reconciliations etc. It is noisy, talkative, the drum beats popping up here and there highlight the torments that can invade an individual's mind like so many hits in the head, but, say what you want about ""Birdman"", the movie is alive and full of characters with a purpose that goes beyond the simple story-line. Well theoretically, they're all present for the release of an adaptation of Raymond Carver's play, but they're also free electrons moved by their own instinct, pasts and personal issues.<br/><br/>They all have a particular endeavor and they're all tormented enough to pull the blanket in their side when they feel the need. The result is confusing but somewhat exhilarating and that everyone stays dedicated to the play allows the film to keep its common thread, so this mess has a reason to be, and to happen. And there's the central pillar, Michael Keaton as Riggan Thompson: the has-been star. Riggan is an alter-ego of Keaton that fools no one, Keaton ensured the transition between the 80's and 90's with his portrayal of Batman, but only to sink into relative oblivion after Burton's ""Batman"" movies have been relegated to the status of their corny 60's counterpart by Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale. This is not just Riggan but Keaton's comeback and the similarities are so vivid that the performance was probably harder, because it really takes courage to laugh at yourself.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the film isn't devoid from a sense of humor in its constant meta-referential take on showbiz; even actors find the strength to laugh at themselves, like Edward Norton playing Mike Shiner, a very difficult and volatile method actor who's a ticking bomb of unpredictability. Besides Mike Shiner, there's Riggan's daughter, Sam (Emma Stone) who just came from rehab and tries to rebuild her relationship with her Dad, there's his ex-wife (Amy Ryan), a Broadway debutante (Naomi Watts) and the manager (Zach Galifianakis), all these people gravitate around Riggan, who's like the ringmaster and the player of his own bizarre show, trying to find himself while he's not even sure to be worth whatever his conception is, constantly invaded by the voice of ""Birdman"", like a phoenix awaiting to resurrect from the ashes of the past. The conflict is between Riggan's past and future and structures the film's present made of an attempt to conquer pride and self-esteem.<br/><br/>And it's quite impressive that, in this existential swirl, the film had time to make parallels between Riggan's struggles and the obsessions of going viral, dictated by society and affecting the youth. Speaking of celebrities, there is an important scene, Riggan meets respected critic Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) who's like a theater 'Pauline Kael', she doesn't take him as an actor but a celebrity, a media phenomenon, a fraud who tries to steal some prestige, he tells her that all she does is labeling things, giving sterile epithets to hide out the fact that she didn't nothing in her life, they're both part of the same hypocrisy but no one deserves resentment who tries at least to stake his life and do something about it, any Youtube commentator could get a taste of Riggan's rant. Yet these comments are relevant because everyone seeks approval and popularity.<br/><br/>I guess what ""Birdman"" shows is that we're all driven by opposite forces, one that tells you what you're really worth, or that you're a God, or a bum, it's all about perceived, real and felt value, and how we can express any of them. The film is an eye-opening experience about people's inner needs to be accepted, but it's more about reaching the kind of state where a man can master his being and control himself in order to accomplish what he feels he's meant to do. Maybe unconsciously, but it borrows a lot from another stage-themed film about aging, John Cassavetes' underrated ""Opening Night"" where Gena Rowlands played a character in conflict with her self-perception and yet wanted to make her performance worthwhile for the audience as if the people in the theater were the incarnation of life. There might that idea that there's something in theater that encompasses life, as there are many moments where the line between reality and fantasy gets confusingly thin..<br/><br/>Were these bits pretentious? Well, I don't think one's work wouldn't reflect part of his ego and maybe what we take from pretentiousness is the strong presence of a man's personal vision in his work. In that case, this is a real masterwork, and a dazzling drum-beat driven journey that feels like a good companion to ""Whiplash"", a co-nominee of the same year. ""Birdman"" took the Oscar home, maybe because it wasn't as linear as ""Whiplash"", it tried to go beyond the limits of imagination, or because it fooled the Academy, but maybe the talent it takes to fool the audience deserves an Oscar after all, maybe, it's all about fooling people as long as you don't make them look like fools."

","Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) follows a washed up Hollywood actor who ends up in Broadway, writing, directing and acting in a play, all the while dealing with his family problems and his deteriorating mental state. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton gives an amazing performance here. He sells himself to this character 100%, and it pays off beautifully. He really gives off the impression that he as a person is where his character is at. As for the supporting cast, Emma Stone is fantastic, though I wish she was in the movie a little more. Edward Norton is similar to Keaton, as in he's fantastic. While he isn't quite as good, he's still stunning to watch. His performance here is Oscar-worthy, no doubt. Zach Galifianakis and Naomi Watts both give great performances here too. Everyone is great, let's just leave it at that. <br/><br/>The writing is fantastic. The characters are authentic and interesting, and the way the plot progresses is just the same. It's exactly where it should have been, and there's no better way this movie could've gone. <br/><br/>And of course the directing is outstanding. There are so many moments of 'how did they do that?' How is it that Alejandro G. Iñárritu pulled off each of these shots? And where would you make a cut? I had so many questions, but they were more in awe than in frustration. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is great. It's largely composed of drums, and it's a pleasure to listen to. And still it doesn't end there. The soundtrack is used at specific points to show what's going on in the main character's head. It's used to further represent and give the audience an idea of where he is mentally speaking. <br/><br/>Overall Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is stunning. It's a combination of great acting, great writing, great directing, and a great soundtrack bunched up together into one giant ball of perfection. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this wonderful piece of art."
"RossRivero99","10","1","3","2 March 2017"," Inarritu's best film since ""Babel""
","Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a movie that is one of the most original movies that I have seen in this decade with a cast that literally knocks their performances out of the park in this movie and now that i'm writing this review I couldn't agree more that this was an Oscar worthy movie. The movie stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson a broke Broadway actor who is in the process of making a play called ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" that is adapted from Raymond Carver. Thomson also wrote the script and directed the play and this his chance to make or break his career. Thomson is also having personal struggles he has a daughter named Sam (Emma Stone) who has at first a rocky relationship with him, and an ex-wife named Sylvia (Amy Ryan). During one of the rehearsal scenes of the play we see Riggan practice with co-stars such as an actress named Lesley (Naomi Watts) as well as two other actors and one of them he refers to as ""The worst actor he's ever seen."" who then gets injured. After the injury scene he talks with his attorney and his best friend named Jake (Zach Galifianakis) to find a replacement actor for the play. Within a few minutes they find an actor named Michael Shiner (Edward Norton). Another actress that I forget to mention that was in the play was an actress by the name of Laura (Andrea Riseborough).Like some of my other favorite filmmakers I have never seen such a style like Inarritu's when it comes to directing a movie in a long time even though with a lot of filmmakers like Spielberg, Scorsese, or Tarantino it's till there and that skill is to get to the point with any type of story, and believe me Inarritu's direction is excellent. During the movie the play went on to become a huge hit and resurrected Riggan's career as an actor. Even though this is a great movie that teaches people that when you are in a bad situation of any kind such as your career being in dire straits you can always redeem yourself and soar above your problems and be at the top of your game once again. This is one of the 10 best movies of 2014."

","The movie seemed to stay below the radar for many (including myself), prior to it's release and for most before its Oscar titles. Now out in the wild, the film deserves to be watched. As soon as the first scene unfolds movie magic is present. The single-shot style cinematography works for most of the film, only to break the ebb-and-flow of the movie periodically, trying to incite a more artful shot or an attempt at a comedic vibe in a scene. The acting is phenomenal, and each character seems deeply developed and fantastic to watch. The best part (and the reason why you need to watch this!) is figuring out the story, motives, characters and the themes of the movie. A lot of open-ended films make you feel frustrated but every now and again comes along an ""Inception"" or ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" and you're glad you don't have all the answers. There are parts of the movie that try a little to hard and insist upon itself, but never so bad to take away from the core experience. A terrific work of art!"
"cherold","8","1","3","21 September 2016"," Probably More Clever than Profound, but Certainly Fun
","When I saw Rope, which Alfred Hitchcock famously filmed as though it were one continuous take, I was disappointed, because the continuous take effect wasn't nearly as cool as I expected. Decades later, Birdman does it right. The entire movie is filmed as one long take, with the camera swooping and gliding and wandering about. Not only is it cool, but it doesn't feel like a pure cinematic trick, but rather a technique to create a sense of claustrophobia and chaos, and to allow actors long, intimate, intense scenes. <br/><br/>The basic story is straightforward enough - has been Hollywood Star Michael Keaton attempt to storm Broadway and experiences various disasters and personality conflicts - but the movie asks you to question everything you see from the beginning, when Keaton is seen floating in mid-air. The question of whether Keaton is supernatural is soon joined by questions of whether this movie is seriously presenting worn out tropes like a brilliant, destructive actor or a vindictive, all-powerful theater critic or whether everything in the movie is actually a mental projection. <br/><br/>While the plot lives in a strange reality, it is counter-balanced with very grounded performances. The cast is excellent, particularly Ed Norton as the brilliant destructive actor and even more so Emma Stone as Keaton's angry daughter.<br/><br/>The is this real or not vibe is most reminiscent of the brilliant TV series Wilfred, but overall the movie seems like a mix of Living in Oblivion and Black Swan, two entertainment-industry movies that toy with reality. <br/><br/>It's not, for me, quite as good as either of those. Yes, it's brilliantly acted and clever as all get-out, but I'm not sure the movie really has much to say; it feels like it just wants to impress you with its cleverness, and while it does, I wish I felt there was something more to it.<br/><br/>All the same, it's a really interesting movie, and a must-see for fans of cinematography, for which it deservedly won an Oscar."
"lemrogers","8","1","3","22 August 2016"," At the end of the day, nothing is important.
","Birdman (or the Unexplained Virtue of Ignorance) is far from ignorant about the state of modern cinema, and art in general. It's more than just a fantastic film. It's a brilliantly weighted commentary on modern society, criticising both TV dinner box office hits as well as critics who do nothing but bemoan them. Most impressively, however, is that the film is self aware that it's contradictory. Once again, it's far from ignorant. <br/><br/>The film is a masterpiece purely on an aesthetic level. Of course, everyone will mention how amazing the one take feel is to the film, following Riggan and co. tentatively in their journey to transform themselves from washed up actors to true artists. Antonio Sanchez' freestyle score is perfect for Riggan's ego, as if acting as his own sole soundtrack. The casting is spot on as each actor essentially plays a 'deformed version' of themselves, blurring the lines between film and reality.<br/><br/>Where Birdman really hits the nail on the head, then, is in it's ability to question and comment upon reality. It throws up some existential crises for both characters and audience alike. What is the difference between art and entertainment, if there even is one? Is art still relevant if it doesn't appeal to the majority? Why do we let our egos control us so? Riggan's character battles intensely with his own self importance, as we can relate to. All of us have a birdman inside ourselves, but we have to remember, and take solace in the fact that, nothing we do is important. <br/><br/>Needless to say, Birdman, as the character says so himself in a brilliant moment directed to the camera, is a film that rejects pure entertainment in the traditional way for a compelling study of narcissism within the arts. Ironically, this makes it so much more entertaining than the large majority of films."

","I cheated a little bit here: I'd actually seen the first 10 minutes or so of Birdman before, but switched off for one reason or another. It certainly wasn't alienation that turned me to tune off: I had been itching to watch it properly for a long time.<br/><br/>Revisiting was a very, very good idea. If you haven't seen this Alejandro G Iñárritu (Babel and the upcoming The Revenant) beauty, stop reading this garbage and get cracking.<br/><br/>If for whatever reason you're still here, I'll continue. The plot is simple to grasp: Riggan Thomson, played by Michael Keaton (who of course played Batman) is a washed up action star who used to play the titular Birdman in a series of superhero movies. There's more to him than it seems though: he displays ambiguous signs that his superhero role may not have been an act.<br/><br/>In a bid to reclaim his stardom and financial security, he is running a play on Broadway in unison with Jakes, his lawyer and chum played by Zach Galifianakis of the Hangover fame. Galifianakis is on form, playing a more intellectual role than that he is typecast in, akin to his role in the excellent but short-lived TV series Bored To Death.<br/><br/>Throw in an array of extra talent, most notably Emma Stone as Thomson's troubled daughter and Ed Norton as an acclaimed Broadway actor drafted in at short notice to star opposite his girlfriend, played by Naomi Watts.<br/><br/>Each share screen time relatively evenly behind Keaton, stealing scenes in their own right. As the show's opening night approaches, with preview after preview performance, the pace of the movie continuing to increase accordingly. Characters and their story lines intertwine into a complex but very coherent mess.<br/><br/>There are constant shouts to theatre throughout, almost as though this is a play recorded for the silver screen. Researching online, it seems rehearsals were rigorous to get the flow of the film down to an art. The hard work pays off. The start is jarring: you're thrown in at the deep end, but you're soon up-to-speed and glad of your front row seat.<br/><br/>The cinematography is subtle yet stunning (it did win an Academy Award for cinematography as a nod). It's appropriately dark and moody backstage, and bright when the cast take to the stage.<br/><br/>Each shot is stitched together seamlessly. Every transition is sleeker than the last, often following a character out of one room and into another down the winding corridors of the theatre. It's deliberately fast-paced, claustrophobic, and a thing of beauty.<br/><br/>Solo jazz drumming is the only real music here, interspersed between each 'scene', the term used loosely. It's noticeable louder and panicked in times of stress, and soothing in rare moments of clarity. When the movie approaches its conclusion, the music reaches a peak.<br/><br/>The conclusion, whilst perhaps erring towards anti-climactic, is still a triumph. For a film that builds up to opening night, it doesn't disappoint. You aren't left wanting more. Every loose end is tied up nicely.<br/><br/>It's more than satisfying end to a treat of a film. But this is more of a film. This is a love letter to thespian farce, a worthy Oscar winner and a time investment I'd gladly make again. The only tragedy here is that I won't get to enjoy this for the first time once again."
"lesleyharris30","9","1","3","18 July 2015"," Worth the Watch, but not worth Best Picture,
","Birdman is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a very unique film, you won't find anything like it, ambitious is an understatement, and I think, for the most part, it succeeds with these huge risks, the whole film taking place in one take is very impressive and that is the main reason why this movie looks and feels like no other, Michael Keaton is in terrific form in the lead role, easily the highlight of his career, he plays Riggan Thomson very naturally and with pure grace, it didn't seem like an easy character to crack but he owned it. My biggest issue with this film is my biggest issue with any movie that has this flaw, the lead characters are not likable, no matter how bad or evil the character may be, we need to always have a reason to sympathise with them and want them to succeed in some way, I didn't care for anyone in this, as a matter of fact I think seeing them fail would have made me happier, that is never the way an audience should feel towards characters that aren't suppose to be villains. Admittedly it is a work of art and will surely be remembered in years to come for its distinctiveness, but I definitely don't think it deserves the Best Picture Academy Award, it definitely earned its award for directing and cinematography, but as an overall picture, it's not powerful enough, it's a comedy, and I love comedies, but I would much rather see powerful dramas like Whiplash or Theory of Everything walking away with the crown, Birdman isn't breathtaking to watch, I didn't finish the film in shock or awe, and it's the movies that do that for its audience that deserve the award. Though it's not a perfect movie, Birdman is different, very well acted and at times quite funny, it's certainly worth the watch and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy drama. <br/><br/>A struggling actor who once played an iconic superhero is put under pressure as he tries to put together a play that will hopefully put him back on the map. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Michael Keaton Worst Performance: Andrea Riseborough"

","The film tells the story of an actor who tries to regain his past glory by producing a theatrical piece on Broadway. At first the film was a little boring. The story didn't seem to be going somewhere, the whole birdman mix up with the star moving things without touching them, the whole voice in his head and the quick move from one place to an other didn't help the case. However the second part of the film gets better. The story finally unfolds, the drama grows and even though it doesn't succeed on being a comedy, the presentation of the characters and the deepness of their feelings is one of the best things of the film, if not the great performances, the shots and the idea of the good old theater and art being washed away by medium quality blockbusters. The fame and the glory of Hollywood is based on the foundation of the fake art, and the movie simply points that out through the eyes of a blockbuster hero who tries to convince everyone and himself that he is a real actor. The camera follows the actors as they move, changing the scenes by simply getting out of the room along with a character, and I think that that was the best part of the film. So 7 out of 10 for Birdman."

","Everything is excellent about this movie, and you can't argue about that. Sure, some people say it was boring, but from most people I heard this from, they are just people who like to watch a movie from entertainment purposes, and not just to experience a beautiful film with no flaws. This is a perfect movie. It has a great ending that leaves you to interpret what the movie could mean. The cinematography is fantastic, and so is the acting. Sure, some people might say that Emma Stone might be the weak-link out of all the actors, but I still thought she was great. And people will probably think that's a flaw, but all the other actors were FANTASTIC! Speaking of FANTASTIC, THE SCORE WAS FANTASTIC!!!

"The_late_Buddy_Ryan","5","1","3","29 April 2015"," Best film about an aging artist's career reboot on Broadway? ""All About Eve"" still in the lead!
","I liked Iñárritu much better when he was turning out heavyweight art-house flix like ""21 Grams"" and ""Biútiful."" In his earlier films he didn't hesitate to take on XXL themes like chaos theory (""if a butterfly flaps its wings..."") and globalization; the results were sometimes pretentious and incoherent, but they weren't boring. In his big US crossover move, he narrows the focus a bit-high vs. pop culture, Broadway vs. Hollywood, print vs. social media-and in the end he seems to be playing to an even tinier audience of showbiz insiders and fanboys (see ""Trivia"" on this page for a long list of smirky inside jokes and gossipy riffs on the cast's defining roles and personal quirks).<br/><br/>After a promising early scene in which Method fanatic Mike Shiner (Ed Norton) shows struggling director Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) how to cut a few lines from Raymond Caver's famously laconic prose (I guess that's an injoke too, but it's a pretty good scene), the film completely loses momentum. We couldn't get too interested in Riggan's high vs. low dilemma or the brittle backstage romances, and Inárritu's trademark magic realist touches (very effective in ""Biútiful"") just seemed pointless-e.g., Riggan uses his telekinetic powers mostly to trash his dressing room. The final question the film raises-whether Riggan has lapsed into self-destructive psychosis or achieved transcendence and taken to the skies-is of course left unanswered.<br/><br/>Maybe the rigid shooting schedule and the showoff cinematography (which apparently didn't allow for many retakes) put too much pressure on the cast; only Emma Stone seems really comfortable in her role. Long story short, ""Birdman"" was a major disappointment and a bit of a chore to sit through; the only time I felt any honest emotion emerging from the murk was when the film was quoting someone else-Keaton reciting the last lines of the Carver story or a few quiet bars of a Mahler song suddenly becoming audible (amid bursts of infernal drumming) on the soundtrack..."
"iraisrael","10","3","18","25 October 2014"," Why Alejandro Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" Will Sweep The Golden Globe Awards And Academy Awards
","""There is no female Mozart because there is no female Jack the Ripper."" ~ Camille Paglia<br/><br/>""...for man is, if I may say so, 'the sterile animal'."" ~ Nietzsche<br/><br/>Alejandro Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" is a ballet cum emotional and visual roller-coaster. If you enjoy sitting at the edge of your seat with your mouth agape watching dramatic pyrotechnics then this is your movie.<br/><br/>The first awards will go to Emmanuel Lubezki for his soaring and searing cinematography. How he was able to dance so fluidly with the actors, careen through intricate mazes, and move from exteriors to interiors via windows will remain a mystery to me. The choreography of the interaction between the camera-person and the actors must have resembled the architectural plans for a small city. Mr. Lubezki has taken cinematography to an entirely new level and you will be bedazzled by the fruits of his labors and artistry.<br/><br/>The next award will go to Emma Stone for Best Supporting Actress. The breadth of her character is wide and Ms. Stone's profundity is apparently inexhaustible. <br/><br/>It is possible that both Edward Norton and Zach Galifianakis are nominated for Best Supporting Actor awards but I imagine Mr. Norton will win because nobody will believe that a comedian - the fat guy between two ferns - could deliver such a mesmerizing performance.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione will be overlooked in the category of Best Editing because it appears as if they have done so little actual work - meaning that the film is the most seamless adventure you will be taken on in a movie theater and it feels as if there are less cuts than I have fingers. The enthralling dynamic between camera and actors will be to blame for Mr. Crise and Mr. Mirrione not receiving Best Editing award. A shame. Similarly, although the primal music and sound editing of ""Birdman"" are integral parts to what make this film akin to riding a raft through a tempest, ""Birdman"" will probably be robbed in these categories by bombastic summer tent-pole movies.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton will win awards for Best Actor for the sheer bravery he exhibits in plumbing the depths of the fruitless and bootless American Dream, of a man who has everything on the outside and nothing on the inside save despair, regrets, dashed hopes and a modicum of talent. That the role may somewhat resemble Mr. Keaton's own career is immaterial. This is a stunning, stellar performance. Period.<br/><br/>Alejandro Iñárritu will win the award for Best Director because of the comprehensive scope of his artistic vision and his flawless execution. Subtle details and nuances speak volumes in ""Birdman"" and it is easy to see how his grandiose portrayal of common characters and themes raises the bar on storytelling in what remains of Western civilization. The only possible deficit of this film is that the final scene echoes the final scene of the French version of Luc Besson's ""Le Grand Bleu,"" but given the options of the often tragic, hollow trophy of commercial/financial success à la Gatsby and the often comedic, pursuant quest for spiritual/artistic redemption, the Birdman's leap into our fantasy-land is the only viable ending.<br/><br/>""Birdman"" encapsulates almost every classic male protagonist from Icarus through Faust, Charles Foster Kane, Willy Loman, Stanley Kowalski, Jake Gittes, Tony Montana... every man's dire quest to ultimately to be heard, be appreciated, and to be not just admired but loved. The film is a masterpiece. Easily Best Film of 2014. And if you love literature and painting and music and ballet and theater then you should not miss it."

"cleary-joshua","10","2","10","17 February 2015"," Brilliantly self-aware, satirical and visually extremely unique...
","This was the last of the 8 'Best Picture' nominees from 2015 that I saw, and I was terrified of watching it. ""Birdman"" had received a huge amount of hype over the lead up to the Oscars, and what if I only liked it because I thought I was supposed to? I went into the film ready to critique every tiny detail, to be annoyed by it and to go against the crowd. What made the film even more incredible, therefore, is how much I enjoyed it by the end. ""Birdman"" completely took me into its world and made me adore it, not allowing me to find anything to be annoyed at. It's brilliantly self-aware, satirical and visually extremely unique, and what's more, it deserves every single nomination it's been given.<br/><br/>In a plot that mirrors real life in no way whatsoever, Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thompson, an actor who cannot escape the shadow of the superhero he once played on film. Thompson has written, directed and is starring in a new play on Broadway in an attempt to revive a serious dramatic career, but not a lot is going right. He is forced to hire Mike Shiner, a self-absorbed actor with whom he is constantly at odds, and as a result every one of the previews goes in a very unexpected direction. Also at the heart of the film is his strained relationship with his daughter, played by Emma Stone, and with the two female members of his cast, played by Andrea Riseborough and Naomi Watts.<br/><br/>The film builds up towards Opening Night, with everything making Thompson more and more stressed – he's convinced that the reviews are going to be terrible, that everything will go wrong. Making matters worse is the voice in the back of his head, that of his on screen alter-ego, Birdman. Birdman is frequently reminding him of how much of a failure he is, and it eventually drives Thompson to various breakdowns from which he does build himself back up. One scene involving Thompson flying about New York and becoming a superhero once again is visually stunning and a brilliant moment in his character development.<br/><br/>It would be impossible to talk about the film without mentioning the visual effect at its core – the trick of making everything look like one continuous take. Iñárritu pulls it off masterfully, making it noticeable but not detracting from the on-screen action one bit. It merely complements the winding corridors of the theatre and makes everything seem almost dreamlike. The script is constantly sharp and very witty, never taking itself too seriously. This is crucial, especially given the huge amount of ""high art"" that is referenced throughout the film. Everything from Jorge Luis Borges and Shakespeare to Mahler and Ravel is referenced throughout the film, and it takes huge risks at seeming unbelievably pretentious. Because you know that satire is at its heart, especially given the constant pop- culture references and deep conversations about the nature of art/celebrity, it's all very tongue-in-cheek and you're allowed to enjoy these artistic name-drops.<br/><br/>Having only seen one Michael Keaton film before, that being the underwhelming Batman film that ""Birdman"" is partially satirising, I didn't know what to expect, but I thought his performance here was outstanding. He brings across the mental struggle of his character perfectly, and also never stops being believable – the scene where he rushes through Times Square in his tighty-whiteys is hilarious, and Keaton suspends your disbelief the perfect amount so that it never stops feeling true. The supporting performances work very well, and Norton, Stone and Zach Galifianakis are all very good throughout. There is far too much good stuff to mention here, but visual effects, set dressing (nothing feels glamorous and that adds to the realism) and music all deserve a look in.<br/><br/>So, ""Birdman"". I made myself want to hate it just in case, and it made me love it. I adored the artistry of it all, was entirely captivated by its world and found every element fascinating. Perhaps the messages about art, criticism, celebrity and social media struck me most, but I think it could appeal to anyone. Definitely a very strong contender in this year's Oscar race."

","I didn't know what to expect from Birdman when i went to see it the first time, but once I sat down and the film started I was absorbed. The story was bizarre from the start as the viewer is shown the fragile state of mind of Riggan Thomson as he prepares to put on his first Broadway play, but is haunted by his former superhero alter ego, the titular Birdman. <br/><br/>As Thomson, Michael Keaton portrays a icily calm demeanor that is about to crack if pushed too far, also displaying the weakness of a man who is trying to relive his glory days. Keaton keeps the emotions to well contained minimum without going over the top and does not overact.<br/><br/>His long suffering daughter, Sam, is expertly handled by the mature talents of Emma Stone. Playing the part of a former drug addict and teenager is not the easiest task, but Stone is fully capable of both. Her pasty complexion and wide gray eyes convey the appearance of a girl haunted by her own issues, but also her father's obsessive behavior to reclaim recognition. The interactions she has with both Keaton and later Edward Norton (as Mike Shiner) convey an adult wisdom flawed by her teenage exterior and poor past choices. A career best performance so far for Miss Stone with more to come. <br/><br/>Amounting a third Academy Award nomination for his performance as self-absorbed narcissistic Method actor Mike Shiner, Edward Norton again proves his knack for being versatile and good at his craft. His jerk-off behavior both endears him to the audience and also repulses the viewer as he mistreats his girlfriend (a brilliant Naomi Watts as Lesley), upstages and is often at odds with Keaton's Riggan which make for the finest scenes in the film between Keaton and Norton and a reflection into his mind and soul with Emma Stone's Sam provide the viewer with insight of a man who behaves immaturely and is insecure in his own confidence. <br/><br/>Cinematography is exquisite and near flawless as it was edited into a single take. The effect provides a Broadway play-like atmosphere that fits the film's action. It is also difficult to follow at times as light and shadow often blur the frame. Music is mainly percussive, played on a drum-set with an occasional string harmony that is almost angelic and bombastic.<br/><br/>An indie film for the ages!"

But not until recently, I had a chance to see 21 grams and was fascinated with the intense story telling style of Alejandro. Hence I always had the inclination to watch Birdman.<br/><br/>This movie gives us a feeling of being shot in one continuous take. The editing, screenplay, music (mostly drums), lighting (a tinge dark as it is shot in a theater) all aspects of film making were brilliant. Lead by an extremely talented Michael Keaton, the all- star cast visually outperform each other. The best part of the casting was getting Michael Keaton to play the lead who is an iconic superhero battling his ego. <br/><br/>Keaton has given a complex performance and especially the scene where he talks about his father and suddenly turning it around was awesome. This performance has earned Keaton his first Academy nomination and I hope he will win it. Edward Norton as always has done complete justice to his complex role. Emma stone as Keaton's daughter has given us a feeling of her having a very troubled mind. Some parts of the movie are shot like a metaphor and some with a mind voice constantly talking to Keaton. <br/><br/>The story is a bit complex and I wouldn't mind watching the movie again for a better understanding. The director has left the end for the audience to decide and it is on you to finish things off the way you would want the story to end.

","5 February 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Birdman. I have to say that was one of the most bizarre films I have seen in a long long time........and I absolutely loved it. My cinema going chum said....'I can honestly say I didn't understand all of it'......and I have to agree with her, but it was an edgy, dark comedy which tackled it's demons full on and dragged you down with it. Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomas, a once successful film actor who starred in a series of superhero movies. Turning his back on yet another lucrative sequel he is gambling his money, his family and his life producing, directing and starring in a play on Broadway. The whole of this film has that ""just off Broadway"" feel to it as each of the characters on and off the stage battle their demons and try to put on a brave face for the audience. Keaton's acting was supreme. You could openly see the turmoil within his character as he tried to overcome the malevolence being fed constantly into his ear by his alter ego. Although this is a whole new character for him, I have to point out that in one particular bar scene I definitely espied that insane white faced Beetlejuice. Don't go and watch this film expecting to come out revitalised, and clear about what you saw, because you will not......come out of it having witnessed a phenomenon, and some very clever acting."

The film score comprising of drums and percussion. Michael Keaton gives in an inspiring performance.

","To say I was excited over the world for this movie would be an understatement. Here's just a couple of facts to give you an idea. I never, ever watch trailers or read plot synopsis before watching a movie. All I had going into this movie was a vague premise, a 30 second clip I accidentally had watched and the gargantuan hype surrounding it. With only that in mind I actually had a dream about this movie the day before watching it! So with all this excitement I knew that the second I would come out the question I would ask myself was: did it match your excitement? The answer to that question is: it just missed the mark by minuscule lengths, but boy what a piece of art to behold! <br/><br/>There really is no two ways around describing how awesome the cast is, how solid and palpable is the direction, how smart and brilliant the content is, how edgy the comedy is and how breathtaking is the cinematography. The only way I could go on talking about them would be a long list of positive adjectives that wouldn't make the point. I loved how the film is so filled with what pop culture is at the moment and what it has to say about it, which moreover can be interpreted in different ways. I was floored by how funny the movie was yet at the same time how touching and deeply reflection-inducing it was for a film geek like me. It has a remarkable energy. It is so dynamic and smart you will be sitting on the edge of your seat for the full duration, desperate not to loose one single thing. I want to address how much I loved the scenes involving Norton and Stone at the top of the theater. They probably were my two favourite. In those moments there was such a balance and harmony between entertainment, reflection, edginess, satire, comedic undertones and sadness, I feel I could not take it all in at once. I will probably end up going to see this movie again and again just to go back and watch on the big screen these two amazing pieces of filmaking.<br/><br/>All of this is great, but as I said in the intro the movie missed the mark of total awesomeness for me just because of one element: it felt like in some, and I underline some, moments it was missing something and in others it had too much of the same thing. What would this thing be? I can't really find a word for it, but if I had to define it it would be punch mixed to social commentary. In some scenes it looks like it was trying to reach for some kind of effect, but was narrowly missing the final point and in others it looked like it was really trying too hard. It just was missing that blast you would have in other moments and the film, after having watched it 4 times, feels uneven throughout. <br/><br/>Still, ""Birdman"" goes right down in the list of the movies that made 2014 such a great, astonishing event to watch unfold in cinema, how happy do I feel to be a movie fan and be alive in 2014."
"roland-scialom","9","2","10","5 February 2015"," The existential crisis of a theater director in century XXI
","I watched the film last night. I would add that the existential crisis through which Riggan passes reminded me that of Guido in 8 1/2 Fellini. An existential crisis experienced by a director during the assembly of a work that looks like it will not reach an end because of problems which show up successively, and in a stunning way. These two crises are separated by about half a century, during which important changes took place in the scenario where we live, the rhythm of our lives and in people's heads. Riggan's crisis takes place in a Broadway theatre in the XXI century, in the middle of hubbub which surrounds the Broadway atmosphere, while Guido's takes place close to an Italian thermal waters resort where his movie is being filmed. Riggan interacts with Birdman while Guido interacts with his memories of situations that have marked him, from his childhood in a college of catholic priests, until his directing career, passing through his father's longing with whom he could never communicate and various passions for women extremely attractive. Riggan wants desperately to be recognised as an author and an actor while Guido is concerned about putting together the several pieces of his life up to the present. In the end, Riggan turns into a creature which fly through the window of the hospital, while Guido put all the characters of his memories in a circus ring where they parade with the sound of the great music of Nino Rota."

"Troy_Campbell","7","2","10","17 January 2015"," Clever, enterprising and ambitious.
","Going head to head with Boyhood for the Best Picture Oscar, this quirky meta-dramedy about a washed-up movie star attempting redemption on Broadway has generated much applause from critics around the world. It's not hard to see why, what with director Alejandro González Iñárritu's ambitious technical achievements, the razor sharp satirical screenplay and a bunch of soul-bearing performances. Presenting the story as one long continuous take, Iñárritu employs all the tricks of the trade in search of something unique and it largely pays off; his ever-flowing camera segues between scenes creating a dreamlike atmosphere. Finding where the shots have been joined, however, can at times distract from the emotional journey crafted by Iñárritu and his team of writers, in a script full of dark humour and irony. Unfortunately there's also a hint of pretension and self-satisfaction in Iñárritu's work – intentional and otherwise – that comes across as smug and, therefore, annoying. As Riggan Thomson, the former A-lister seeking professional rejuvenation on the stage, Michael Keaton gets a long- awaited opportunity to shine in a lead role and attacks it, for better and worse, with unbridled gusto. Ed Norton hogs the spotlight though, with a comedic turn as a supercilious stage actor looking for the ""truth"" in even the tiniest of things, whilst Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan round out the impressive cast. Birdman is clever, enterprising and admirably distinct, if occasionally laborious and inaccessible; it's not for everyone, but lovers of film and/or theatre should seek it out."

","""Birdman"" (or the unexpected virtue of ignorance) , one of the best movies I've seen recently, probably a masterpiece ! It's that movie that makes you live throughout its moments and makes you feel... ""alive"" !!! That flow of emotions that you can't escape, I felt like I was holding my breath all the way and I was waiting for a pause in the movie to just take a step back and a moment to realize what was going on and to understand what there is to understand ! It's the most visually exhilarating and vitalizing film, I wish I could see it in a big screen in theater or something... the effects would probably be more intense. Just genuinely magnificent and outstanding performances! And the percussions all the way that add power, the long one-shots, the movements and actions, you just don't want to miss anything and can't relax as you're watching.. that's absolutely breathtaking !maybe it seems like I'm exaggerating my review, but it was absolutely a great experience watching that movie ! It surely ""took a lot of courage"" realizing it ."
"thegeekboss1228","10","2","11","17 February 2015"," Best movie of the year
","This my favorite movie of the year, with the best performance of the year, and honestly, it would be pretty close to the top in a favorite movies of the 21st century. Yes, it is that good. You probably already know the premise of it, so I won't go over that again for you. But, let me go over the things I love about this film. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu does excellent at direction. The feeling that it is all one shot really works. You might think it would be exhausting, but it's really not. Michael Keaton does amazing, of course. One of my favorite actors of all time, Edward Norton, also does amazing. The rest of the ensemble cast is excellent as well. It might be a little weird, but just adds to how much I like it. It's an amazing black comedy, and if you haven't seen it you should."
"tzachn","10","2","11","5 February 2015"," The Expected Virtue of Originality
","Let me just start by saying that this movie is SO NOT over hyped or overrated. It's one of the most original titles I've seen in years, and it boasts an impressive, cheeky cast of great actors who don't disappoint.<br/><br/>First of all the scene transitions are just spectacular, you feel as if you're being drifted into the living heart and soul of the Broadway theaters, the living, pumping urban feeling of the streets of NYC and the personal lives of almost every character with ease.<br/><br/>Rigan Thomson is an ex superhero called ""Birdman"" who is trying to free himself from the chains of commercial comic books movie productions and prove the world he is more than a man in a suit, but an actor. His character is intense, deep and multi layered and completely explodes on the scenes. <br/><br/>As the movie unfolds you start going into his relationships and see what is actually driving him to go out there and prove himself and Michael Keaton does a great job at that.<br/><br/>Emma stone playing Rigan's daughter is a complete scene stealer, she's intriguing, hot headed yet sensitive and a little out there, which is amazing to watch. She has some of the best dialogs in the film and provides great moments. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast, Edward Norton in particular was great as well on all parts.<br/><br/>Soundtrack is great, packed with drums, bass, snares that all give the feel of the marquee lights and coupled with great shooting - a very impressive visual presentation.<br/><br/>The movie also boasts some extremely surreal moments which are manifested wonderfully using the theater's complex, almost maze like structure, lighting and color use is fantastic as well.<br/><br/>The film is fast, it's funny, it's weird and it's fascinating at once, and it's surely one to keep you talking about when you exit the movie theater.<br/><br/>In summary it should not be missed, and has to be watched with an open mind. <br/><br/>9/10"
"olivier1980","10","2","11","25 January 2015"," A movie that will keep you thinking long after
","I saw Birdman yesterday and when leaving the theater I was not sure what to think. This movie is so unique, that in a way it's hard to comprehend or compare it to other movies. There are so many layers, so many parallels to be found, it kept me thinking about it long after.<br/><br/>You could interpret the movie as a film about life and death. <br/><br/>Suicide is referenced a couple of times: Riggan walking into sea, Sam sitting on a ledge on the roof, Riggard jumping off a building. And then life wins, a shot of birds eating the jellyfish that chased Riggard out of the ocean, Sam leaving the roof and re-affirming life through sex, Riggard embracing his inner Birdman persona when jumping off the roof and flying instead of falling.<br/><br/>And of course, Riggard putting a gun to his head, and surviving only to find himself the most talked about thing in the world, ending his fear about being forgotten.<br/><br/>You can trace the parallels: Michael Keaton personifying the character he's playing; Riggard struggling with the same problems with the character he's performing in his play. Riggard shooting himself and failing, just as a character mentioned in his play who put a gun in his mouth.<br/><br/>Also, it will make you think about fame, popularity and the current trend of things going 'viral'. Riggard is in a way dead, stuck in a pre-facebook age. Slowly he 'awakens' to the modern day, by going viral after accidentally walking half-naked through the city. And then getting a twitter account in the end that has a massive amount of followers, ready for his hurt, bandaged head.<br/><br/>I'll see it again someday, and maybe I'll find myself completely mistaken in each discovery. <br/><br/>In the end, this movie entertained me and made me think, the acting is superb, and it's going to deserve every Oscar it will get."
"panzeri-walt","10","2","11","23 January 2015"," Excellent
","What can I say. Birdman is not an usual movie. The dialogs, the characters, the location exude a spirit typically of New York. Definitely funny, yet thoughtful. Why Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) reacts so despite the success of his show? We would have reacted this way? The weight of the past or whatever this deep depression typical of illustrious personages in 'decadence' is so unsolvable? The film tells us that it has an important weight. I think that despite everything is over with joy for Riggan. He is tested to the end and he never gave up.<br/><br/>The performance is linear, the space-time changes are not perceived or at least are well masked, giving continuity and smoothness to the entire film. It's also very fascinating the insertion, within the normal course of events, of the protagonist's 'misleading' subconscious . Decisively influenced by it, the protagonist finds himself on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The entire film revolves around this analysis of the protagonist and his struggle to reassert after a history of popularity.<br/><br/>In conclusion Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) keeps you attacked front of the screen without ever boring. This is it's real force. Attracts the viewer, amuses him, it does reflect and excite. 10 marks for an original film. 2015 is promising.<br/><br/>Walter"
"j-madej","10","2","11","15 January 2015"," Arguable the best independent movie of the year!
","There always has been a form of competitiveness between film and theater actors. Theater actors would often say that film actor performance depends on the editing, where in theater you need to be able to maintain the character for the duration of the whole play and maintain it every night for however long the play runs. Also the amount of dialog which needs to be learned by head in theater is mostly larger then in film, where director is trying to show the story and not tell it verbally, so to speak. Often cutting unnecessary lines from the script as much as possible to keep it visual. Theater and film are just two different mediums which need two different techniques of the narrative acting expression. In theater the contact with the live audience can be very rewarding indeed, but often the theater actors have a movie star aspiration and they feel like they would love to be immortalized on the silver screen forever. On the other hand you have movie actors who in the twilight of their careers comeback to the theater to see if they still got it. It is always best when actor does theater and film work respectively, which keeps him artistically balanced. Alejandro González Iñárritu's ""Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" might be right up there with ""Boyhood"" as this years best independent movie, which has received numerous Oscar Nomination including Best Film, Actor, and Supporting cast, etc. The last few years Michael Keaton has not been working much, therefor it is such a pleasure to see him taking upon himself such a complex, honest and multilayered performance, as the washed up actor known for a comic book franchise 'Birdman', which obviously is inspired by his performance in the Tim Burton versions of the cape crusader ""Batman"". He is trying to jump start his career by writing, directing and staring in his own play on Broadway. The amount of pressure on his shoulders is unbearable considering that his co-star played brilliantly by Edward Norton tries to sabotage the whole endeavor, as well as Keaton's inability to differentiate between what is real and what is imagined does not make things easier. The whole film is shoot, in what appears to be one continuous shot which in itself is a very hard thing to accomplish. This is not only difficult on the filmmakers, to connect the scenes through invisible wipes (sideways or vertical movement of the camera that blends two scenes together seamlessly), but also puts actors in very hard place, where they often have to deliver up to 15 pages of dialog and hit all the blocking, focus marks, for the scene to work properly. Thrust me, this is very difficult thing to do and only few filmmakers in history where successful in doing so. Alfred Hitchcock with his movie ""Rope"" immediately comes to mind as well as more arty and extremely disturbing Caspar Noe's ""Irreversible"" which contains uncut continuous anal rape scene, which already passed on to the movie history books, as one of the most rough and realistic rape scenes in cinematic history. Coming back to the ""Birdman"", as you watching it, there is a sense that Alejandro González Iñárritu delivered something very special. The reality of the performances creates the feeling like the audience are watching an actual real events unfolding, sometimes interrupted by Michael Keaton's internal and to some extent schizophrenic dialog between him and the character that brought him film related fame the Birdman. I think Michael Keaton delivers, what might be arguably his best performance to date. His willingness to showcase his inner self, to dive in to complex character of an aging star, creates in us feeling of endearment towards him as we all wish him to succeed. He often mumbles and delivers lines in very unorthodox manner which brings back to memory a genius of Marlon Brando at times. He is well supported by Edward Norton who also gets emotionally and physically naked here. The scenes of them together are some of the best in the film. Norton's confession towards Emma Stone's character who is playing Keaton's jaded daughter, about the fact that the only time he does not pretend is on the stage, creates sense of intimacy and honesty which obviously has been noticed this year by Academy which nominated Norton for an Oscar for supporting role. But this film is much more then just two man show. All the supporting cast did really well including Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis and Andrea Riseborough. Watching the ""Birdman"" I must say the filmmaker inside me was trying to figure out where did boom operator and sound technician placed microphones for clean recording of the sound. This is also one of the categories ""Birdman"" was nominated for Sound Editing. For some reason, stylistically, watching it, I was reminded of Charlie Kaufman's type movies like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"". If you liked the surreal style of above mentioned movies, then I am pretty sure the ""Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" will be also to your liking, arguable the best independent movie of the year.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique"

","This film is kind of brilliant, it has effect on your eyes, your ears, and tries to place you in the movie. Sometime it seems , that the story is complementing the music, and the cinematography, not inversely.<br/><br/>It's story is from the Russian realism ( like Kafka - Metamorphosis), with a strong, emotional (southern) habit (in the dialogues), and it is wearing an American suit. Maybe it is trying to tell, and show too much.<br/><br/>The best: The music stops accompanying the movie, it controls your heartbeat, and your feelings, and makes you a part of the movie.

"jeff-971","10","2","11","17 January 2015"," A Major Accomplishment by a Master Filmmaker
","I can't say enough good things about this movie, but I'll try. This is one of the most amazing, brilliant films I've ever seen. Michael Keaton's performance is transcendent. Honestly, I didn't know he had it in him, but I was utterly mesmerized by his performance. The Vérité style continuously honed in on Keaton's craggy face and I couldn't take my eyes off him even when he was reflected in a mirror talking to someone else. The entire cast was brilliant with each performance adding thick copious amounts of meaning to the film. The layer upon layer of this story of love, ego, need for redemption, insecurity, and biting humor left me wanting to see this film multiple times. The writing is brilliant and the filmmaking is so innovative and creative, I have no idea how they pulled it off. Nearly the entire film is portrayed as one long cut. It's a major accomplishment by a master filmmaker. It's incredibly complex in it's choreography of camera movement and shot structure. It captures the insanity of getting a play on stage in a tragically comedic way. Most films are disappointing in at least one department, but the truly great ones make everything cohesively work: music, sound, lighting, cinematography, casting, acting, directing, art direction, and, most importantly, writing. This film does it all. It's high art of the grandest magnitude. <br/><br/>Underlying all its layers, the film says to me: ""Hey, I know actors are all crazy, but we live life fully and passionately although often tragically. At extreme personal cost, we pursue our dreams and wrestle with our inner demons. We NEED to be great and believe it. We are courageous. We risk everything. At our best, we are honest on stage and awaken the human experience.""<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: I wish I could speak to the director about this film. I loved the score. I would ask him about it. The jazz drumming seems to indicate the moments when Riggan is in schizophrenia mode. The orchestra symphony moments seem to indicate what is real, honest, and true or perhaps when art and life are at its greatest . . . and a symphony moment occurred at the end in the hospital room when Riggan disappears out the window which (in addition to Sam looking up and giggling) means he was actually flying.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: My favorite scene was Riggan confronting the drama critic in a bar. When he says, ""I'm an actor!"" and passionately annihilates the critic who has nothing on the line other than ulterior motives and writing a few paragraphs, I nearly cheered out loud. It was better than any action hero taking out the evil bad guy."
"Kenny-f-bieber","10","2","11","20 December 2014"," Bird is the word!
","Very few films these days I would deem wholly ""perfect"". So when one sees such a film it's impossible not to feel overwhelmed by it's sheer greatness and artistry. This summarizes my reaction to this film which left me dazzled , euphoric and at times utterly speechless, no really. By now many know the basic plot and concept so ill go on to describe why you need to see this as soon as possible. For starters the direction is utterly masterful , each shot is composed with such care and vision it's nothing sort of breathtaking. The one-take technique is incredibly inventive and employed masterfully throughout , it needs to be seen to be believed. <br/><br/>I'd be remiss without mentioning the brilliant ensemble cast as well. Keaton delivers the performance of a life-time , it's funny , sad , raw and completely committed. Norton , Stone , Watts and Galifianakis are astounding playing off each other beautifully. it also contains a brilliant script which is equal parts cunning satire and astounding tragedy. Throw in a great score , terrific dialogue and sharp pacing to boot. In short Birdman is the reason we love and cherish movies. Do yourself a huge favor and run don't walk to see it. In fact if you can spread your wings and fly to it , trust me it's worth it."
"JoeyCelia","10","2","11","3 December 2014"," 100% Brilliance- A Human Being Review
","I am going to write this review and I am going to try and sound nothing like a movie critic. I watch movies simply for one reason... and that is because they make my life more interesting than it already is. <br/><br/>On that note, Birdman is spectacular. Ever since viewing both the teaser trailer and the international trailer I really wanted to see it. And upon viewing it... it did not disappoint me at all. A lot of people might say ""It was boring... it was an actors movie... blah blah blah."" And what I say to those people is that they completely missed the point of the movie. Birdman tries to show us that technology is slowly beginning to ruin us along with the help of the negativity that comes along with Hollywood, critics, etc. Birdman creates an idea in your head that is hard to take out of your head.<br/><br/>To me, the most important aspect of this movie is the brilliant writing by Alejandro and his co-writers. I know that people have said ""But this movie is amazing because it is one continious shot."" Believe me... I think that is tremendous and very unique (just like this movie) and I extremely love that. But without the writing this movie would be nothing. Now, the second tremendous thing is the acting. Michael Keaon, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone knocked it out of the park. Along with Zack Galifinakus, surprisingly because I was a little skeptical of him being in this movie after viewing the trailers. But every little thing of this movie was perfect. And if you view it properly... you will realize how beautiful and perfect it really is.<br/><br/>You have to watch Birdman with a sense of emotion. You have to imply it to your life and your experiences. And watching all the chaos in this movie all unfold before your very eyes makes it such a movie experience. It deserves to be seen by everyone every where."
"TheMarwood","7","2","11","10 November 2014"," Great acting, technically accomplished and lots of jet black humor
","A washed up big screen actor mounts a Broadway show as a comeback vehicle and with this loon in charge of production, things go hilariously off the wall. Keaton does fantastic work here as a man desperately clinging to the need to be relevant again and is tortured and occasionally guided by the voice and powers of Birdman. As opening night gets closer, the stress sends Riggan into a tailspin of unhinged behavior - his play might be an embarrassment, an actor keeps sabotaging previews by getting drunk and trashing the set or having an erection on stage, his daughter fresh out of rehab hates his guts, his kind of girlfriend might be pregnant, he's burning through all of his cash on this play and the most powerful critic wants to kill his play on the principle of who he is. It's not easy being a self absorbed lunatic, who once played an iconic superhero. Occasionally Birdman can meander and by the film's conclusion, every actor has their scene to emote and while a few of those can feel a little episodic, there's always enough humor and wit to overcome any bumps along the way. Norton in particular is a standout who is hilarious as a difficult actor. Designed to be one long unbroken shot, occasionally it feels like a gimmick, but more often than not, the cinematography feels invisible. Most of the camera work feels spontaneous and the focus pulling is as accomplished as the seamless edits. Birdman is an odd and original work with some jet black humor throughout and a fully committed cast makes this always fascinating to watch."
"mrsean-1","10","2","12","5 February 2015"," So many reviews full of sound & fury, but signifying nothing...
","I am astonished at the number of negative reviews appearing here. These reviews are scathing. The reviewers seem distraught at the fact Birdman has received such critical acclaim and these same reviewers seem desperate to stop others seeing the movie. <br/><br/>Everyone is entitled to an opinion but when does vitriolic personal opinion qualify as constructive criticism? How can we reconcile the disparity between these 1 or 2 star 'opinions' and the critical acclaim and 9 Oscar nominations? <br/><br/>While I can understand some of the criticism, I think much of it is unfair & misguided. A simple example of this is the criticism that the characters in the play within the film are not developed enough;that the film fails to explore these characters in any great depth. The fact is, that is not what this film is about - these characters are merely part of the backdrop to what is the fundamental focus of the film - the characters who play the actors in the play, and of course, Michael Keaton's character. It is entirely unfair to criticise the film makers for this. <br/><br/>In fact, the majority of the criticism does just that - berates and chastises the film makers for somehow failing to do their job properly. Marking their creative work with an 'F' simply because they dared to express their artistic vision. Admonishing them for daring to be 100% true to their creative idea.<br/><br/>Birdman is truly creative. It is what it is. Just enjoy it."
"markabarrancos","9","2","12","18 January 2015"," Why has it become more and more of a fad to despise originality and antagonize unique films? Get over yourselves.
","Seriously, people need to get over themselves and re-watch this masterpiece to become more aware of what they are watching in the first place. The movie being filmed with one continuous shot was something that is barely seen, and it's very effective because it captures the atmosphere of the scenes and their characters more, but people managed to twist this pro into a con and downplay it. The acting is unbelievable (and how wouldn't it be with that cast), Keaton is at his best in years (possibly his career best), Norton was great, and I was pleasantly shocked especially with Galifinakis and Stone, it seems as if they completely broke out of their typical characters and came out as something new. Zach is in a more serious role (and he does it very, very well) than his past work, and Emma as well (although she's been in serious roles before, they haven't been done with this much talent). The writing is great, and is absolutely hysterical in certain scenes (I mean that in a good way). The relationship between Riggan and his Birdman past alter-ego is also great conceptually, and is very satisfying to watch. But this movie's best aspect is its ambiguity, in multiple scenes and then most notably in the final scene (You'll understand when you see it). You can jump on either side of the fence and equally have the same amount of credence. That's ambiguity, that's something in cinema that when done right can add a lot of depth to a movie and actually make it better and give it replay value, etc...I don't want too spoil it here but the finale is definitely thought provoking and I suggest being mindful in the scenes leading up to the end.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, while relatively simple and less of a score in comparison to the other movies in 2014, is still nice, and very fitting. The direction (as I was slightly talking about before) is phenomenal, the camera-work was very well done and the aesthetic for the film overall was obviously handled with a lot of care. I praise Alejandro González Iñárritu for his work, and will be sure to watch some of his other movies that were recommended to me (Amores Perros, Biutiful, Babel).<br/><br/>In short, Birdman is simply the best of its year, the masterpiece above the rest, the essential movie of 2014 to any cinephile sniffing around theaters for a good movie (Yes it's still in theaters). Don't listen to these ignorant users, and see for yourself.<br/><br/>Final score: 9/10"

"Robert-Andrew_D_Smith","10","1","4","1 January 2020"," And the movie of the decade-award goes to...
","Ah... what an achievement. I though that I'd never make a review about this perfect movie... but f#ck it.<br/><br/>The Academy award winning screenplay is in my opinion probably the second best of the decade, behind Bir Zamanlar Anadolu'da for a slight bit. There is just so much thought and effort put in it to make a sensible comical story. There's many quotable lines in it and all of them fit to the characters perfectly. Characters are amazingly written and developed perfectly.
For me, the comedy in it wasn't all that funny. I'd criticize this movie for not being funny, if there wasn't one bit that changed everything completely. The comedy, made everything much more sad. Riggan Thompson's struggle and unpopularity was trying to be funny, but for me it made me care more about the character - Riggan Thompson is just like Llewyn Davis. It didn't make me laugh, but I'm sure that it made someone else laugh his/her #rse off.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is phenomenal and I'm shocked that no-one got an oscar for their performances. Even the more minor roles, like Zach Galifianakis's, were great. Michael Keaton's performance was mind-blowing, Edward Norton was spectacular and Emma Stone was the perfect icing on the marvelous cake. For me this is the best performed movie of the decade.
...And I got to ask the Academy Awards, how Patricia Arquette's performance was better than Emma Stone's?!<br/><br/>The cinematography is fantastic, it's something that many other movies fail at. For a guy like me, who cares even more about the cinematography than anything else... it's just beautiful. The best way to define the cinematography, would be comparing it to ""9th Symphony by Beethoven"", both are just incredibly beautiful. The way of making it look like a continuous is meta and perfect. Having the shot looking like it's continuous needs everything to be perfectly timed and that's where the directing comes in. Alejandro G. Inarritu makes everything seem so perfectly timed, that anyone else couldn't probably do. That's the reason why Richard Linklater shouldn't have won an Oscar for directing, and I'm happy that he didn't. Cinematography was the best of the decade, beating even Bir Zamanlar Anadolu'da which had also a very beautiful cinematography.<br/><br/>The soundtrack for this film was the third best of the decade for me, with Inside Llewyn Davis and Gustavo Santaolalla beating it. The drum soundtrack was amazing and it accompanied the movie really well. Of course, people's tastes are different, but I seriously recommend you to listen it.<br/><br/>As a whole, this movie is an achievement and technical marvel that everyone should at least check out. For a small budget of $18 million, it's amazingly made. $18 million isn't a small amount of money, when we think that Whiplash took only $3.3 million to make, but to achieve this much with only $18 million, it's just f#cking amazing.
I don't think that I can find enough words to tell you how amazing this movie is. There is just so much to talk about it, but this is as much as I can tell you without spoilers. I can't recommend this movie enough so please, do me a favor and watch this movie.<br/><br/>I'm really happy that Academy Awards gave this the Oscars that this movie deserved, but I can't forgive them for not giving any Oscars for acting. This movie got the attention that it deserved and I'm happy that Alejandro made this and Revenant in a row. It's a new decade now and I hope that Alejandro makes a comeback.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sean Penn: And... the movie of the decade-award goes to...<br/><br/>(pause)<br/><br/>Sean Penn: Who gave this son of a b#tch his green card?

","This film tells the story of an over-the-hill actor called Riggan Thomson (brilliantly portrayed by Michael Keaton) who was once the star of a superhero blockbuster franchise known as 'Birdman'. We are shown his journey into making a Broadway production starting with the initial rehearsals and read-throughs. What follows is a brilliant exploration of celebrity culture in an intriguing and satirical way.<br/><br/>'Birdman' could essentially be looked at as one continuous long shot. The camera constantly weaves around the actors and action and so the audience are completely immersed into the perspectives of the various characters (mostly Riggan's). The opening shot plays like a scene in Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Boogie Nights' as it delightfully establishes the narrative in a fluid and polished style whilst introducing the cast and their entertaining interchanges during a rehearsal with hilarious consequences.<br/><br/>The editing throughout the picture is almost flawless when moving from scene to scene and has a dizzying effect much like Gasper Noé's 'Irreversible'. 'Birdman' also boasts some marvellous special effects throughout such as when Riggan (Keaton) is alone and being taunted by his egotistical alter-ego. The film shows up typical blockbuster action movies by asking the audience what they want and giving it to them in a manner which embraces the excitement and epic-ness of the genre whilst also poking fun of the conventions.<br/><br/>The music that accompanies the film is very scarce in a lot of places adding emphasis to the dialogue and situations arising but, in some cases, an erratic and improvisational drum riff can be heard (occasionally accompanied with the drummer on the set) which completely adds to the eccentricity and spontaneity of the movie.<br/><br/>The screenplay is very intricately written and contains many profound philosophical speeches about art, celebrity and criticism. There are monologues and debates by characters in which they discuss the core beliefs of the film such as Riggan's speech during his performance of his Raymond Carver play ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"".<br/><br/>The whole narrative of the film is very intriguing and interesting. There is a perfect blend of comedy and poignancy. There are a lot of twists and ambiguity throughout the film which could be analysed and interpreted for a long time.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton is fantastic as the protagonist and gives a performance that would have given his career a huge revival (his squeal is my highlight of the film). The parallels with the character's career and that of Keaton's could not have been a mistake and gives the performance that much more edge. Edward Norton plays the method actor from hell (Mike Shiner). He is annoying, snobbish and smug and played brilliantly by Norton who excels in the vileness and pomposity of the character.<br/><br/>The film is very much about actors. The self obsessive nature of acting is definitely highlighted by the two central performances but there is also a cast that really help to deliver the film's meaning such as Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough and Naomi Watts.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Birdman' is a fantastic film. It is filled with pathos and profound imagery whilst keeping the viewer thoroughly entertained throughout. I feel it thoroughly deserves all of the award nominations that it is receiving and my final rating is an average of 4.5 stars."
"earthguy","10","1","4","4 March 2017"," Novel style of film making from Alejandro G. Iñárrítu - masterpiece
","Scanning the reviews, I have seen a horrible representation of what this film is. It is no surprise that there are perhaps 8 out of 10 reviews that post a 1 star rating (which stands for 'terrible - do not ever watch!'), and I vehemently disagree with that position. <br/><br/>When you look at the breakdown of the 1 star rating for this film, it accounts for just 2% of the audience, so by no means is that 1 star rating an accurate portrayal of the brilliance of this novel, artistically styled film.<br/><br/>After having seen the Revenant, and now this, I have to say that Alejandro G. Iñárrítu is now my favorite director out there. There is something about his films that has me absolutely glued to the screen, and wanting more. I very often, in a long movie, eventually find myself drifting and moving about uncomfortably at some points in the film, however, I have noticed that the end of the film comes long before I realize, even though the films are quite lengthy. His incredible way of telling a story is indeed masterful, he draws you into the story and you essentially become a part of the plot line.<br/><br/>Not only that, but as the audience, you feel an innate feeling where you are questioning things for the central characters, and there is a strong sense that you are a part of the action on screen. His films are strong with ambiance and emotion, and I will say this here, he is not afraid to try new things, and for that I commend the work of this brilliant director for breaking the norms and trying something different and new.<br/><br/>The style used in this film, has very little editing. In fact, a lot of the sequences go on for 5 to 10 minutes, it is one heck of an accomplishment and brilliantly done. Similar to how our individual existences are - things don't cut in and out that way and this way in our realities, we are looking through a constant frame of reference, and as such, you become a very tight observer of the story-line.<br/><br/>I noticed some have criticized this style of filming in the comments, as if it is done for ego and to amaze, but to me, they have missed the plot and the intention. Of course, not everyone will get it or understand it, but my advise is to simply ignore some of the negative comments around and to see it for yourself as is, and to come back and put the comments in the place they deserve. <br/><br/>The same could be applied to a controversial artist appearing in town, there will be the critics who receive it negatively, but for a majority of folk that appreciate novel art, those critics are to be ignored, you need to see it for yourself to understand it. If you're looking for stock standard, formulaic films, then this film might not be what you're looking for, and there is plenty of that around so, next!<br/><br/>This is not your stock standard Hollywood film template, and I think that Alejandro has a real gritty, ingenious take to movie making and I hope that he will be making many more. He has a unique angle that I believe will, in the decades to come, be appreciated as masterful.<br/><br/>My last criticism is of reviewers giving a 1 star rating to a movie that is far from being an awful piece of rubbish. I don't think there are many movies out there that deserve that accolade. It is often slightly humorous that a movie that is so professionally polished, filled with top class actors and improvised sound pieces, could deserve such negativity from people that actually most likely took a liking to the film, appreciated the art and other aspects of the film, but probably reviled that the story line didn't have the sugar they wanted. That said, the ratings itself speaks volumes and those voices are trying hard to make a point that gets washed out from the true greatness of this amazing film.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
"soerenbruns","10","1","4","24 September 2016"," One of this era's defining films
","It often occurs that the truly challenging films that instantly divide audiences prove to be the ones finding their place in film history. The reason why half the viewers love them and half the viewers hate them are essentially the same, they just provoke diverse reactions. I am sure Birdman is THE film of this decade (so far) that will overcome polarised reviews, subsequently going down as one of the definitive classics of our time. Still, while being an admirer of the film, I totally see how somebody could be put off by it. Because Birdman is unique, bold and absolutely committed to its central ideas in a way not many films are. So the confusion this can cause might turn into annoyance. However, this commitment is exactly what makes watching it such a remarkable experience.<br/><br/>We follow Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), a former Hollywood actor famous for his superhero films ""Birdman"", who tries to push his career in a different direction by bringing a play he wrote to Broadway. In contrast to the blockbuster films, he wants to do something meaningful. Still, he has a hard time finding his way in the theatre world that is so different from the environment he is used to. On top of that, his former role seems to haunt him as a voice in his head. He tries to convince him to return to the movies in order to make mindless works whose sole purpose is distraction and entertainment.<br/><br/>This is the set-up for a satirical dark comedy. The humour however plays out very subtly and presents itself as a mere by-product of the actual existential crisis Riggan goes through while trying to stop the play from turning into a disaster. <br/><br/>The way the film is presented is often (at least here on IMDb) a point of criticism. As most people probably know by now, it is depicted (seemingly) without any cuts, resulting in one epic shot captured by a camera floating through the tiny halls of the theatre. What could be a pseudo-artistic gimmick is actually a genius metafictional way of framing a film about the making of a play, since the film itself feels like a play. Furthermore, it effortlessly deconstructs conventional means of depicting time lapses. With one camera shift the film sometimes progresses several hours (for example when two characters talk about the preview later that evening and the camera moves away from them to the stage where this very preview is already happening). It is a depiction of time unlike anything I have ever seen before. Incidentally, it is much more similar to our actual experience of passing hours as they also seamlessly glide from one to the next. It is a filmic anomaly just because the viewer is used to decode montages, flashbacks, jump cuts and so forth which are just conventions. Therefore, aside from the metafictional aspects (of which they are a lot more in the film), this lack of visual cuts has a lot to say about the discrepancy of how we experience time and how we portray time.<br/><br/>That's why this is not a self-indulgent, ""artsy"" show-off technique. It is unique, but not for its own sake.<br/><br/>Apart from that, director Alejandro G. Iñárritu (who proves himself to be ready to explore new grounds since you would have never expected a black comedy by him) has assembled one of the greatest casts of all time. Moreover, as he often does, he manages to push each and every actor and actress to his and her top level. Zach Galifianakis instantly overcomes his stereotype of being the cartoonishly stupid imbecile in a film; Emma Stone got an Oscar nomination practically with one monologue (absolutely deservedly, since it is utterly intense); Edward Norton playfully fleshes out the pretentious theatre diva and gives this archetype some real depth; Naomi Watts scintillates (once again) with nailing jokes with perfect timing as well as depicting truly heartbreaking despair; and Michael Keaton just gives the performance of his career by examining a man breaking down bit by bit, mostly because of his inner conflicts he cannot resolve.<br/><br/>These actors bring to life a script that is packed with clever thoughts about our perception of art, the relation between fiction and reality and the mechanisms that come into play when trying to achieve something exceptional, which is in the end a very universal strive of humankind. Thereby, the narrative gains an extra dimension that goes way beyond the theatre context.<br/><br/>Basically, I can just encourage anyone to see this film. I actually consider IMDb to be quite a trustworthy source. But that Birdman is missing from the Top 250 list due to its ludicrously low rating is just madness."

And superbly directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu. Alejandro G. Inarritu has turned out to be a master of his craft with movies like birdman and biutiful . Sad part is many people could not even understand it. it is definitely not for everybody, but it is certainly for those who still got some need for unconventional cinema with a conventional touch."
"Solnichka","8","1","4","13 December 2015"," Entertaining but hardly ""the best film of the year""
","The acting in this movie is excellent; that being said, the story is good, too. It's a little different for those that can't think out of the box, but overall, it flows well and ends well. The main character is one viewers can connect with and sympathize with as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>The film itself is unique with the long tracking shots and the small set of the St. James Theatre feeling very claustrophobic, but that enhances the story itself being told. The cast is not large, but it's effective right down to the moment where Andrea Riseborough and Naomi Watts make out backstage. It's not gratuitous; it's very believable. <br/><br/>The existential aspects of the story aren't going to be for everyone, and that's where the film can lose half its potential viewers. But a willing suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy and value this film; that may not be possible for everyone."
"mikeburdick","8","1","4","5 October 2015"," Finally, a deserving Best Picture
","Once in a blue moon, a Hollywood film comes along that you wouldn't expect from Hollywood. Rarer still does a film that feels un-Hollywood also win Best Picture. So good on the Academy for choosing ""Birdman.""<br/><br/>While the script is unexpected and decidedly off-beat, there are some mildly implausible relationships, requisite violence and ""push the envelope"" sex scenes that lead me to believe ""Birdman"" could have become yet another quirky indie film, like ""American Splendor"" or ""Living in Oblivion."" But it's Iñárritu's incomparable direction that pushes it into the realm of classic. <br/><br/>Firstly, the choice of Michael Keaton to play a Hollywood actor much like himself in real life was genius (although Robert Downey Jr. might have worked as well). The fact that he took the role, which pokes fun of himself, elevates Keaton to legend status alone, forget that he owns the role and is entirely convincing. <br/><br/>Secondly, the choice to capture entire scenes in a single shot and even segue from scene to scene (seemingly) without cutting makes it feel as if we're seeing an entire three days uncut. This simulates the nervousness and sleeplessness of Riggin, increasing the viewer's unease throughout.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the jazz music score perfectly reflects both the shambolic life of Riggin and the camera-work, which makes the viewer feel as if we're continuously falling, uncontrollably from one scene to the next. <br/><br/>But most of all, the magical realism—whether in the script or added by Iñárritu—that creates a poetry not often seen in American films, more reminiscent of films like Emir Kusturica's ""Time of the Gypsies"" or Gregory Nava's ""El Norte."" While Hollywood is quite consistent in spelling everything out for viewers, world cinema is not afraid of creating impressions and leaving loose ends untied. <br/><br/>It's encouraging that a film like ""Birdman"" has been awarded with the highest honour. Perhaps we'll start to see more films from Hollywood that, rather than entertaining us for 90 minutes with superficial two-dimensional story lines, are allowed to explore the universes within ourselves and let us answer questions for ourselves."
"almosalami","10","1","4","9 July 2015"," This film is so REFRESHING!
","To all the naysayers out there, aside from the unique execution of the film, focus on the DIALOGUE, because pretty much all of it is social commentary or thought-provoking words of some kind, and it is surprisingly deep and amazing. It took a second viewing for me to really get a good grip of the film as a whole as well as appreciate its dialogue and execution but man, this really makes one hell of an all time favorite classic! And what really hits it home for me is that THEY JUST WENT FOR IT! I mean, in everything! Not just the stunning and unique and original way they shot the film, but in the clever commentary, in the parodies, in the surprisingly real and at times hilarious dialogue, in the artsy psychology of the main character, in the crazy scenes (Michael Keaton vs Edward Norton fight, A LESBIAN KISSING SCENE), in the score (which is just drums), everything! It's the kind of film that you can't appreciate in just one or two watches, because this film really is a lot deeper in many ways, and not in the typical way art films are but in a very refreshing, more real way. And you see, this kind of film wouldn't have worked at all if everything wasn't done to near perfection (I mean, just imagine seeing the script of this along with all the ideas for how it should be executed annotated along the side - CRAZY!). The acting is unbelievably great, not just from Michael Keaton (who, btw, the film's main character is parodying - in case you are not familiar with the guy - in not only how he hasn't really been in anything since 1992, but he last played BATMAN, which is very comparable to the film's main character and Birdman), but the whole cast, all-round, and I was especially surprised by Emma Stone. I already had a good opinion of her as an actress before the film, but she raised the bar for herself! The scene where she just rants out at her father had my jaw drop to the floor, and this is a very different role for her compared to other films that she's been in, and she does it so well. Now some people talk about how they don't get the plot, and really, this isn't that kind of movie! This is a movie where the dialogue dominates, and not a twisty-turny plot. Aside from the rants of the characters that has got the film critics saying this film is social commentary and what-not, there are a lot of moments that were surprisingly hilarious. And that's really what sets this film apart from other artistic films - aside from the actual deep real things it has to say about life and fame and film, it has a great humor to it. And just like everything I already mentioned, the characters are also not so straightforward and deep. The character Edward Norton plays, while a jerk, if you listen to what he says, he actually says the truth, and it reminds me of so many of my favorite characters, like House, Sherlock Holmes, just to name the most well-known. The character of Michael Keaton, though to different degrees, really represents pretty much everyone with a dream/failed dream/past-his/her-time, and if you think through what he's going through, you can find what he's struggled through in the movie in yourself, and that just makes the film even grander for me, because that makes me reflect on my life and how I chase my dreams. I could go on and on and to the reader who has stuck to this point in my review, I wish I could just watch the movie with you next to me so that I could point out all the awesome things this movie has with it, but alas."
"awusher","10","1","4","5 July 2015"," Brilliant. Complete genius
","Watching Birdman I was in amazement the entire time, from the acting to the way the film is shot to the script, just utter perfection. Although 'Birdman' is some what an 'arty film' it still had my attention the entire time. If you want a gripping narrative and non stop action or jokes this may not be for you. Every actor within this film plays their role almost perfectly. Emma Stone stood out especially, as to me personally I feel this is some of her best work (not hard to beat after the amazing Spiderman films). I adore how small yet powerful the theme of this film is as it is a satire of Hollywood. I am aware that this isn't a film for everyone as some will hate the artiness and originality of this film, but others like me adore this masterpiece. I agree that this film deserved best picture as it is shot beautifully and flawlessly. Birdman is one of the best films of 2014 along with the likes of 'Boyhood', 'Whiplash' and 'Guardians of the galaxy'. If you have a free night, I highly recommend watching this."

The movements of the camera, the screenplay and the film's events, will daze you and you don't know which parts are real and which parts are delusion. The actors and the actresses played their roles in the best way. I had a lot of eager to watch this movie in the soonest time but actually it was not the thing that I expected. I don't want to say it was lower or higher than my expectations but it somehow surprised me. This movie will keep me thinking for a few days.

What it is also unbelievable is that the movie insults in a little and unnoticeable way the theater. The T.V is the bastard son of the theater, that's why we have never seen a TV show making a joke about the theater, and the cinema was a product of the theater and I can't recall a movie when we laugh about the theater, but this movie does make jokes about the theater. Now, people don't have to pay attention to the story, they miss the shots, and what this movie creates is amazing. You don't know how hard it is to create a plane sequence, I know this is not an actual plane sequence but still amazing. The photography left me speechless. And the music is something else, the drum music gets into your nerves and makes a whole new atmosphere in the history. What I can say is that Alejandro wanted to prove that he is better than Cuarón, because Cuarón is the master in photography and plane sequence (Children of men, Gravity). And 2014's Academy Awards Cuarón was the real stuff with Gravity, so Alejandro wanted to do better with a ""plane sequence"". You need to appreciate better this movie."

Actually he understands that the only way he can become immortal on stage is killing himself with the gun on stage. This way he brings the ultimate truth on stage (dying on stage is the super realistic performance that no critic can ever dispute) thus achieving fame and recognition by the public, the critics and the press, but mostly by his daughter. He has understood that, and for the first time his is calm before getting on stage for the final act. Death shall blend both worlds into one.

""A contemporary American movie with all tit- bits and some more = Birdman""<br/><br/>The cast comprising mainly of Michael Keaton​ resurrects - in reel and in real with his semi-paranoid performance; Edward Norton reminds of his ""Primal Fear"" time, only less insane and more of a prick; Emma Stone​ is unconvincingly good and a surprise along with Zach Galafanakis​ who gave a fairly 'out-of-their-stereotype' supporting performances. A special mention of the screen writing team, for developing a ""par- normal"" story. I wasn't at all bored, even while watching it for a 2nd time.<br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu​ is applaudable with his multi-character narrative-style and so is cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, whose efforts have made this drama-comedy to look like ""one continuous shot"". One might not pay too much attention, but the film gives the feel of a non-stop plot, stretched over a few days. However, what makes it engrossing is viewer's genuine curiosity towards this story; just like the title, it all comes as a surprise - ""The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"".<br/><br/>As one wise man said - ""A man must know when to give up on things he cannot achieve""; the film not only touches this instance subtly, but makes it one of its most sparkling moments. ""Finding glory and achievement, through failures"". <br/><br/>A happy ""8/10""."

","This movie has a fantastic cast, and not only because I like the actors, but because it seems like each role was tailored for them. Norton being a brilliant actor, but difficult to work with. Keaton living down his reputation from Batman, Stone as the cynical smart-mouth, it all just fits. I'm sure the way the movie was made, with the long takes, had its effect on the chemistry between the actors, as they all had to be in tune to make it work. (Speaking of tune: The soundtrack was really interesting as well!) The movie explores fame, celebrity, success, creativity, but probably most of all: coming to terms with who you are. It does so successfully, by expanding the theme from Riggans character to all of the supporting characters as well. They are all in it together, and all struggling with the same things, albeit on different levels.<br/><br/>So, what's not to like? While it's hard to pinpoint exactly what I didn't like, the Birdman-sequences didn't quite sit with me. The relationship between the Riggins-character and Birdman was interesting, I think I would have like it better if it was downplayed a little, and more indirectly hinted at. Maybe.

These choices pull you into the story and give it a realism usually reserved for action movies - cleverly jarring with the Birdman 'references'. Furthermore the brittle and enigmatic relationships are brilliantly performed and worth watching.<br/><br/>However this film completely falls apart narratively. No characters are likable leaving the viewer uninterested in the plot - despite the gripping visuals. The superhero nature of Birdman is not explained and referenced far too weakly, barely figuring in the story. A few flashbacks jar with the story and the 'big reveal' doesn't carry any weight as I find myself simply uninterested in Keaton's character.<br/><br/>I found the set design and choreography of the camera and actors - changing 'scene' by transitioning around the set - intriguing, especially how the director handled complexity. However there were simply too many threads to the plot, none appropriately explored and too many 'messages' to really handle. Did it deserve the Oscars? Well for screenplay, absolutely not. There were moments of sparkling dialogue but the plot felt far too weak to deserve this Oscar. (Certain brilliant lines were lost by traditional Hollywood mumbling, a shame.) Best director? Again, the control of camera and actor - this choreography - was brilliant. But as a director of dialogue Iñárritu completely failed, many great lines were simply lost - again this was undeserved. Best motion picture? Whiplash and Interstellar to name but two, were more deserving. Best cinematography? It was stunning, full of intriguing artistic choices; but Nightcrawler sticks with me more, so no.<br/><br/>To summarise: 6/10. An interesting idea, technically well executed but let down by a weak narrative. For a truly great 'oner' try Russian Ark."
"syed-50877","8","1","4","27 March 2015"," A very difficult review
","I just watched the movie and read a couple of reviews as well. Almost all the reviews are poor. However, I must say that I liked the movie, a lot actually. It tries to look at the world from the eyes of a ""once famous"" actor. There have been numerous such attempts before, including that of hallucination and all but I think birdman stands apart. There is no or very little story-line but that's OK. The point of the story is to convey an idea. If you can convey the idea is a few words or a single image, it does the job. You do not need 1.5 hours all the time. Birdman is about a once famous person trying to make a come back. The couple of days he spends during the previews, all that happens around there. The birdman's perspective of the world around him is so different from the perspective of other people. That I think is the story-line. There is nothing great about the story. It has been told numerous times. But the way it is shown here makes it worth a watch. Its not really an art movie but does manage to convey the ""idea of ignorance""."

"hamass-mujadid","8","1","4","14 March 2015"," Birdman Flies High With Controversiality, and Novelty
","Most of them chose Boyhood, even I did in the first place. But then I watched Birdman again, and I saw what I had not earlier—Birdman flew very, very high. Sadly, people didn't notice either him or his flight.<br/><br/>The metaphorical and direct connotations of Birdman, or in fact Alejandro, were both comedic and moralistic. The drama hidden beneath the colloquial surface wasn't easy to decipher; it required immense analytical ability. Most of the audiences, while being mesmerized by the cinematography (Lubezki made it as if Birdman were filmed in one shot), found Birdman boring and yawn-making. This was partially because of the ambiguity it ended with, and partially because of the disguised curtain between superficiality and reality. None of them understood the subtle difference between the two. In fact, none of them could figure it out—did it end on ""Birdman"" or ""man""? This ambiguity ruled Birdman out for some because they didn't think it was worth digging into. Well surely those people were wrong.<br/><br/>I internally confess that Birdman has a better screenplay that most movies in Oscars' archives. The Grand Budapest Hotel did defeat Birdman in BAFTAs but so far, it is Birdman that has successfully dominated hearts and minds of most analysts, given its realism, and intellectualized ambiguity (I know that sounds strange). The movie's end is what has become one of the controversial endings of all-time, and believe me, this ending has crossed the Inception and Interstellar thresholds—was it figment of Sam's imagination, or was it Riggan's freaking obsession, or was it the just-before-the-last-breath thingy? What did Birdman say? Surely it remarked upon the mental mingling that sustains in the inner-self of the highly stressed and freaked-out people, myself included. But was it a story of success, despair, or desperation? Even the screenwriters, while on HuffPost Live, said that the movie's ending is left to audiences' interpretation. This interpretation still needs to be figured out, and this unidentified interpretation won for Birdman the Oscar for ""Best Original Screenplay"". <br/><br/>The plot Birdman picked was entirely unpredictable, over-the-top, core-of-the-diversified-world, and actually-happening. We see people in our daily lives who are obsessed about the things they love, which in my case would be with film criticism and analysis. But in this edifice of unjust and ever-ticking world, nothing happens the way we plan, and although we eventually get accustomed to practicality, we have this idealistic flower inside ourselves that itch, so that we aloof ourselves from whatever hurdles we face, and go on with the undefined journey is ambiguous ways. This quest is so effectively portrayed that it boosts up consciousness and conscience. Scripts like Birdman do not exist; it's singular, and will remain so for a long, long time. While ordinary people were peeved off at it, I was not (although initially I was). Birdman didn't have competition, and so it legitimizes its win.<br/><br/>Birdman was the first runner-up in the chase, following Boyhood in all award ceremonies. It has remained the choice of novels, but Linklater's delicacy with the task-at-hand left everyone vulnerable to his directorial spell. Birdman remains one of a handful of movies that avoid any make-ups, or artificiality, in the film-making. The events of life, in both, were as close to realism as I am to keyboard at the moment—they were really happening. Although I said, and stand by the standpoint that Boyhood is banal, I espouse on the ""fact"" that the screenplay was too brilliant to be just ordinary, while being only ordinary, as paradoxical as it sounds. However, Birdman goes one step ahead by taking movie-viewers to the height of real-life experience of real, surreal, superficial and mental bundles and leaves us to doubt the existences of destiny, justice, fate, hard-work, and other so-called prolific elements of success. <br/><br/>Birdman follows a course from dramaturgical point of view that is completely unheard of. Alejandro allows such independence and flexibility (not fluctuation) in story-telling that doesn't speak the likes of most, even Kubrick for that matter. Most artists I know might twist and confuse, and deliberately antagonize audience to intensify the scenarios. Alejandro, on the contrary, speaks the human genome. This movie, unlike any other of '15, is made solely for critical thinkers, and the Academy-people have in a long time, agreed with me on the final call."
"mlssufan02","6","1","4","11 March 2015"," Philosophically Confusing
","This movie basically comes right out and tells you it is a philosophical movie. the only problem? Nobody understands any of the metaphors or other philosophical musings. The movie is intense and aided by intense performances by Ed Norton & Michael Keaton, and we kind of got the gist that Keaton & Norton were theater performers; Keaton was formerly a star of a highly successful hero movie. The One takeaway I got was that the human race is highly susceptible to stupid story lines as long as the movie has cool special effects, and that actors can always return to that role if they are down on their luck. I'm not really sure where they were going with that, because they could have easily portrayed that without a philosophically jumbled confusing movie. Emma Stone was a good fit for the role of Keaton's daughter-- but had no place being the love interest of a twice-her-age Ed Norton. It was OK for Norton to be the creep hitting on her, but not OK for her to be willing and ready--that just doesn't make sense. Somehow, the actors still captivated my attention at times, but the movie is so hard to follow, I still don't know if I know what it's about. Basically, this is a horrible script that happened to get good actors along the way."

","'BIRDMAN: OR (THE UNEXPECTED VIRTUE OF IGNORANCE)': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Critically acclaimed indie black comedy flick starring Michael Keaton as a has-been movie star, who puts everything he has into a Broadway play; in hopes of recapturing his past glory. The film costars Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan. It was directed, produced and co- written (with Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, Jr. and Armando Bo) by Alejandro González Iñárritu. The movie is a Oscar hopeful in many categories; likely including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (for Michael Keaton). I found it to be a really interesting and well made film but not quite as good as all of it's hype.<br/><br/>Riggan Thomson (Keaton) was once a huge movie star that starred in three blockbuster superhero movies (as the popular character Birdman). He hasn't made a hit movie in the 20 years since and hungers for that fame, and relevance, again. So he's writing, directing and starring in a play adaptation of Raymond Carver's classic short story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". He's invested all of his money in the production; including refinancing a house he promised to his daughter Sam (Stone), who's also a production assistant on the play. While trying to make the upcoming premier a success, Riggan struggles to get along with the cast and crew; especially Sam, his girlfriend Laura (Riseborough) and a self absorbed actor named Mike Shiner (Norton). He also hallucinates that he has telekinetic abilities and often talks to himself in the voice of his former character Birdman.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty funny, it's also a great psychological character study and fascinating look at showbiz. The directing is always interesting to watch and it's pretty cool how Iñárritu manipulates the camera-work, and editing, to make the movie feel like it's all one continuous shot. The score, that's highlighted largely by drumming, works very well at setting the tone and mood for the film as well. The acting is all excellent too; especially Keaton. Experts say he'll likely win the Oscar this year because (like the play is for his character) this movie is redemption for him (having starred in two blockbuster 'BATMAN' films, just over 20 years ago, and not having made a hit movie since). I like and admire the film quite a bit, but it's not one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/g8YMJ5tBLQ8"

Thomson is trying to revive his career by writing, directing and starring in a Broadway play, an adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". In the style of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rope"" - The movie appears to be told in one continuous long shot, thanks to some manipulated camera-work and editing. The movie feels like a cinematic version of a play – or more perhaps 2 plays, as you go between characters performing the play based on Carver's story and their real lives. Keaton and Edward Norton, who plays Mike Shiner, an ego driven actor who is a supporting player in Thomson's play, has been getting Oscar Buzz for the performances. They both indeed have moments of greatness in the film, as does Emma Stone, who plays Thomson's daughter' Sam, and Naomi Watts, who plays Thomson's girlfriend Lesley, another actor in the play. Zach Galifianakis is a particularly hoot as Jake, Thomson's Best Friend and Lawyer. There is a good deal of Symbolism going on in the film between the play and the characters' lives, culminating in the last shot of the movie. I enjoyed it, though I am not ready to say it is amazing as others have – at least not on just the first viewing. I may adjust my feelings upon repeat viewings.

","Inarritu's Birdman is the story of Riggan (Michael Keaton) a washed up Hollywood actor trying to prove he is a true artist by directing his own Broadway play adaptation of Carver's ""What We Talk When We Talk About Love.""<br/><br/>This movie manages to tackle various themes efficiently. It explores the human need for attention and approval of others. The purpose of life and the legacy we leave behind. It asks what can be considered art and the difference between true talent and mainstream appeal. A critics' role in deciding the success of plays and movies. It takes a satirical look at the movies industry and even manages to take a few swings at modern superhero movies. <br/><br/>I'm not going to defend this movie because I can understand why some people won't like it. Art films are very subjective, you either connect with it, or you don't. What I believe one must admit is the technical feat that was filming this movie to look like it's one continuous shot. Inarritu's tight directing gives the movie a flow and energy that conventional filmmaking wouldn't have. The movie itself feels like I'm watching a play being performed, maybe due to many takes being as long as fifteen minutes. Emmanuel Lubezki once again, works wonders as cinematographer, getting close and personal to characters as they deliver emotional, dramatic and sometimes funny lines. From beginning to end, this movie is wonderful to look at, and at least for me, impossible to look away. <br/><br/>The freestyle drum score adds to the speed and spontaneous feel of the movie. It builds up tension in intense moments and accompanies the flow for the rest.<br/><br/>Every single actor and actress does an amazing job. Everyone seems to be on board and passionate to be working on this movie. Michael Keaton's performance as Riggan is the driving force of the film. He nails the feeling of frustration, seeing his play crumble upon him, along with his legacy. Edward Norton as Mike gives the movie comedic relief throughout the two hours. While his performance feels a little too brash, it fits his character as the cocky, pretentious Broadway actor. Emma Stone does great and has memorable moments, especially in one of the most impactful scenes of the film with Riggan. Zach Gilifianakis shows he can hold his own when away from typical comedies. I've always liked his humor but he was able to show his true potential in Birdman.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>In regards to the plot, I never felt like any part of the movie dragged. While I was not as interested in Mike and Sam's romance, I don't think it took away from the movie. The supernatural powers Riggan seemed to have or imagine and Birdman's voice in his head added a whole new layer to an already interesting character. The film could've ended earlier with the gunshot, to leave the audience wondering Riggan's fate, since it ends on that same note anyways but I enjoyed seeing the aftermath. The positive critic review and coverage his play gains closed the plot nicely and the -open to interpretation- ending with Riggan jumping out of the window to later see Sam look out and smile was just the type this eccentric movie needed. I can see many people hating the ending, but I thought it was a great conclusion to Birdman. <br/><br/>10/10"

","Bird man! For starters did this movie deserve best picture? Maybe? Did it have phenomenal dialogue? Yes! Was the acting Oscar worthy? Most certainly! But did this movie have flaws in some critical areas? Yes! The Bird man Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, starring Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone was a mighty fun time, it gave rich dialogue, superb acting, and excellent character development. Yet it lacked a much needed twist and unpredictable kick start. The story was good but still easy to read ahead, but the acting made it bearable. The awkward and forced love scenes between middle aged Norton and teenage daughter Emma Stone were unnecessary, somewhat gross, and a waste of film time, but they proved short enough not to disrupt the overall quality of the film. Edward Norton delivered one of the best performances of his career, he was loud, controversial and pleasantly rude. The director did a interesting and exciting job introducing him into the film at an unsuspecting time. Michael Keaton was most enjoyable to watch as he seemed to truly fit into his body with no remorse or embarrassment, I give kudos to him for letting the whole world see his 63 year old body nearly naked for half the film, and quite honestly he looks better at 63 then most men 20 years his senior. And of course you can't forget Zach Galfinakis, who although didn't have a large roll, shined whenever he was on the screen, Zach's performance gives more evidence that Comedic actors can act and can act good at that, and not only in comedy movies. Overall the film was enjoyable but wouldn't have been my choice for best picture. But still an excellent film. 8/10"
"BillSims28","8","1","5","7 November 2015"," Five Word Review: Intelligently, Importantly Satirical; Fabulous Performances.
","Alejandro Gonzalez Iñàrritu, director of Biutuful, directs this satirical drama which tells of the mid-life crisis of a man who was once a blockbuster movie actor in the 1990s. Riggan Thompson (played by Michael Keaton, who himself played Batman in 1989's Batman and 1992's Batman Returns before fading from the public eye) was the star of three comic-book Birdman films in his prime, before the sequels stopped and his career as a serious actor fizzled out. Now, helped (and more often than not hindered) by his attorney/friend (an unrecognisable Zach Galafanakis), his daughter Sam (The Help's Emma Stone) who recently left rehab, and a method actor (Edward Norton, Fight Club,) whose ego and toughness to work with mirrors the actor's real-life persona, along with young girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough), his ex-wife Amy Ryan and fellow actor Naomi Watts, Thompson attempts to better his reputation with a play based on a Raymond Carver story, upon which the entire rest of his career hinges. <br/><br/>One of the most impressive things about Birdman is its cinematography. Under Iñarrittu's measured, accomplished direction, the film is made to look like one continuous shot throughout the whole film, despite the events taking place over the period of weeks. This, and the appropriately satirical plot, makes Birdman seem very realistic. But the primary selling factor is undoubtedly the performances, mostly of Keaton, but also notably those of Stone, Norton and Galafanakis. Keaton manages to lend drama and humanity to his role, whilst expertly portraying the inner turmoil between himself and his 'Birdman' persona which mocks him in a gravelly Dark Knight voice and implores him to abandon his ambition of becoming a serious actor and sell out to make money on another Birdman franchise film. Black comedy also peeks through accordingly due to the sharp, realistic and quotable script. An endless repetitive drum beat pierces through a catchy score, possibly representing the mundane repetition and conformity of society, which again shows just how important this film was to the filmmakers and how well-made it was. Thought-provoking and important to the cinematic industry, I hope that this film has at least some effect on the recent influx of superhero films, reboots, sequels, remakes and general cinematic unoriginality. Not that I dislike superhero films - I love a good bit of fun brainless action as much as anyone else, even if I have seen it dozens of times before - but when the majority of the highest grossing films of any given year are unoriginal, mediocre yet attractive films which can be described as nothing better than fun, enjoyable and perfectly decent, it's all rather pointless. No one is going to claim that Thor: The Dark World or The Amazing Spiderman are their favourite or least favourite films of the year. Like many others, they're pretty good; but when they end up with grosses 20 times higher than Whiplash, it seems to defeat the point of cinema somewhat. <br/><br/>Birdman is certainly a triumphant feat of splendid filmmaking and can't be faulted technically, and evidently has no features of being badly made. My only complaints that stop it reaching the highest ratings are the facts that Norton's character disappears, rudely written out of the story two thirds of the way through. It's a shame as he lit up all the scenes he was in and was a constant joy to watch. Also, it's never really enjoyable or compelling enough to be one of my favourite films of the year. But due to being so incredibly well-made, Birdman definitely reaches at least an 87/100."

The insecurities, craziness, mental imbalance that actors in real life experienced, is the most real part of the whole process and was very good explored and developed by the director. <br/><br/>This kind of movie is not for the fans of action or teen comedies, it's for the ones that see cinema as an art.

Riggan runs into some bumps in the form of mike(Edward Norton)- the crazy actor, the estranged girlfriend- Laura (Andrea Riseborough) and delinquent daughter- Sam (Emma Stone). Riggan tries to solve the problems of the, soon to be released, play with a chip on his shoulder in the form of his superhero counterpart. The only one to help him is his best friend Jake (Zach Galifianakis). <br/><br/>Each actor said had a phenomenal performance, no matter how brief, and blew me away. I could only say that Michael Keaton and Edward Norton where the best because they are the most focused on characters. Every other character did not shine quite as bright as Keaton and Norton but shined none the less.<br/><br/>The directing was beyond brilliant. Alejandro González Iñárritu did something stupendously special and brought my undivided attention from start to finish with astonishing angles and splendid shots. He decided to shoot the film like one long take. You barely notice as the film goes so quickly and that is part of the art around it. Iñárritu decided that when he did end a take he would make it subtle. He did just that. I noticed very thew cuts and takes and that is largely due to the intricate editing.<br/><br/>The flaw with this film is probably the fact that it was maybe a tad too subtle at points like the whole superpowers aspect of Riggan. You assume he is crazy but it is meant to be obvious that he isn't and he can actually fly. By the end I finally realised it. I'm not for movies spelling it out to me so I can not argue with Iñárritu letting me figure it out for myself.<br/><br/>The other aspect was Emma Stone. I love her and she is damn near perfection, but if she did not irritate me every second she was on screen. I hated her character and I believed her to be out of place with the others. She was hugely underplayed but I do not know whether that was good or bad based on my displeasure for her role. That being the only huge flaw in the film, I did not find much else wrong with it.<br/><br/>To finish, I loved the beauty of Birdman (Or The Unexpected Vertue Of Ignorance) and it is a wonderful work of art. If I was Iñárritu, I would be sure to hell that Birdman will be my masterpiece.<br/><br/>+directing: unique and tremendously tantalising work from Alejandro González Iñárritu.<br/><br/>+acting: everyone evenly match and Keaton and Norton only stood out because they took majority of the screen time.<br/><br/>+story: well balanced and meaningful. Not your typical Oscar movie.<br/><br/>+music: could not have been anything better to accompany this movie.<br/><br/>-screenplay: did not allow enough time for love able characters<br/><br/>-subtlety: super subtle in some places but can not complain too much as I hate it when movies are not subtle enough.

"chsens","10","1","5","25 May 2015"," It's the masterpiece of contemporary filmmaking
","There's been a while since I've seen such a great combination of features in a movie. It is not a regular film, with a standardly tied plot, and it seems like it has led to it been poorly evaluated by it's watchers. Don't get me wrong, I don't think I am a specialist in movies myself and I even didn't get to all this conclusions alone, but it worries me that even the critics reviews don't quite touch important aspects of the film as I will try to. <br/><br/>Let's begin with the technical aspect. The long Shot.<br/><br/>For god's sake, you can't tell me this was a random choose by Iñarritu. The film is about someone who has chosen to put everything he had left in making a play. That mean that if he makes the wrong movement, he will me damned. In a play, as well as in life, as well as in the (suposely) single-shot filming, there can be no mistakes. The drums in the back are not gratuity as well. It mark this constant noise that makes Keatons thoughts more intense and are marking the mood for a jazz-like improvisation - and again, the thought about one risking itself in making something without the possibility of doing it wrong and fixing it later - that never happens. It sets the anticipation for something that doesn't take place, what only makes the anxiety more intense. <br/><br/>Carver (the writer in which work Keaton based his script) is another important point here. He is a realist writer. When Mike – drunk as Carver probably was while writing most of his books - starts shouting at Keaton saying that scenario is way to unreal he is saying one must feel like Carver in order to make a play about him. He than grabs a chicken leg in the refrigerator while saying ""The only thing real in this stage, is this chicken"". He is reinforcing the main plot, stating that Keaton is never going to make it to theater, because he is and is going to be forever Birdman, and nothing but it.<br/><br/>Mike is the character that make us feel like the play is actually the only thing real about all that story. He can't ever get an erection out of stage. That stage is a place that leaves you totally vulnerable (in your underpants) and at the same time can be where you are totally confident as Mike trying to have sex during the play.<br/><br/>I consider the end good as well, but I can understand some of the critics about it. It marks the only assumed cut and does change the film for the first time to a sequence of more cliché statements like ""now the world loves you"", but I still think there are here some pretty good moments, like Keaton's bandage forming an obvious Birdman's mask, and the possibility of interpretation on the final ""Fly"" by Keaton."

"Theo Robertson","6","1","5","4 April 2015"," I Can See Why It Was Popular With The Thespians
","Somewhat surprisingly the Oscars this year were heavily weighted towards Indie cinema . This is a good thing in my opinion if only because I'm old enough to remember previous decades where Hollywood had a reputation for giving Oscars to studio films with a feel good factor or in recent years awarding films that were being produced by Miramax . Nominating films not made and marketed by the big studios brings some deserved attention to a mainstream audience that would have probably been ignored at the box office otherwise . If a film wins Best Picture then it's got to be worth seeing so that's why I went out of my way to see BIRDMAN <br/><br/>With hindsight the Academy voters have played it very predictably and safe . A film where the protagonist is burned and on the comeback role is something that appeals to award voters . Cast someone like Bill Murray in LOST IN TRANSLATION or Mickey Rourke in THE WRESTLER and you've got something that's approaching meta-fiction . Put Michael Keaton in a film where he plays a washed up actor and BINGO we have a film voters will love . Add constant name checks to other actors working in Hollywood today and you'll have voters falling over themselves filling in those ballot papers <br/><br/>I'm sounding a little bit abrasive and cynical here aren't I ? Yes I am and it's deliberate and I don't want to over state my case here but BIRDMAN is a mildly enjoyable film but no more than that . I can imagine the Oscar voters - the majority of whom are actors - watching the screening and departing to the bar and saying "" Hey I remember that happened to me on Broadway"" and "" Do you think that was supposed to be ... "" . In other words you can understand why it didn't do any spectacular business at the box office but got a lot of awards"
"luciabrutovska","9","1","5","20 March 2015"," Birdman Or The Unexpected Value of Hollywood
","When watching Birdman I was literally excited about the film industry itself. What a beautiful business where the child of Art cinema and Hollywood mainstream production teaches us not to be elitist and distinguish between high and low art - Hollywood and Europe (or whatever you'd like to call it). <br/><br/>In one point of the film Riggan talks about criticism as a matter of labels. With Birdman we see, that what we imagine under the concept of European and American cinema are most likely just labels as well. This is a film shot and made in America but it was more successful on European markets. The country of origin does not predestine the nature of a film. And I think the labeling of Hollywood cinema or in other words the package of prejudices we carry when we go to see an American movie was the main reason for the disappointment of so many viewers that made this film so questionable. We are simply expecting something else especially from a story with such a main character and American origin. So maybe when watching a film it is reasonable to put those labels away. Because as Birdman teaches us: ""A thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing.""<br/><br/>A beautiful meta-cinematic achievement. Congratulations, world of film."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","5","18 March 2015"," Good movie, but not best of 2014 for me personally
","I have to say I enjoyed watching Alejandro González Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" for the most part. The film won 4 Oscars this year, including Best Picture and Director and had also Michael Keaton probably very close to a Best Actor win. It also lost both sound category nominations and two more acting categories. For Emmanuel Lubezki, it's the second Cinematography win in two years. He lost five times before these though. The most interesting difference to its main competitor ""Boyhood"" is that the latter was made over the course of many years and ""Birdman"" looks like it was directed as a single shot with the way they switched costumes, characters and scenery like during a theater play. Fittingly, a theater play is also the very center of the film.<br/><br/>I myself enjoyed the second half of ""Birdman"" much more than the first. It had occasional moments of greatness and was all in all much more entertaining and edge-of-seat stuff than the mediocre first hour. I may think differently about this though on re-watch. Edward Norton I am really not too sure what to make of him. As so often, he is on the fine line between creating a great character and being over the top, but this may also be due to the way the character was written. Emma Stone gave a good performance too, but as with Norton I am not 100% convinced it was Oscar-worthy. Maybe the nomination was exactly the correct amount of recognition. Anyway, let's talk about the heart and soul of the film: Michael Keaton. He surely deserved his nomination and carried the movie from start to finish. But why oh why would they leave a suicidal guy alone in a room with windows??? A bit of a plot hole here. Maybe the only one, however, so I will forgive them for that. But I also did not like the way how he was able to move things with the power of his mind. With Keaton's past as a Batman actor, this role here as ""Birdman"" gets some extra significance. This probably also had a lot to do with why they cast him for the part. Had Keaton's suicide on stage (near the end and sort of expected with how Norton's character mentioned the gun earlier) been successful, this film probably would not have been classified as a comedy with the Golden Globe Awards. Actually, now that I think about it, this film would also have worked nicely with a flash-out like the one Mickey Rourke has in ""The Wrestler"". Keaton also brought the funniest moment to me when he (with his González Iñárritu wig and underpants) ran through the streets and everybody recognized him. (And there's more comedy scenes, not too many though.) Strangely enough, they recognized him despite how it was said earlier that nobody would remember the actor behind ""Birdman"". But then again, he was all over the press with his new play about to come out.<br/><br/>By the way, if you are interested in other films with a smiliar tone, have a shot at ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" or ""Maps to the Stars"" from this year. This was Alejandro González Iñárritu's first film in 4 years and he also had another 4-year break before that. I guess he does not regret these long breaks with all the success and recognition that ""Birdman"" brought him. I believe it is not his best movie maybe, but a good effort and I recommend watching it."

","Birdman is fantastic. A truly mesmerising film. That takes the Mickey out of so many relevant topics like Social media, Ego, Celebrates, Superhero movies and everyone's desperation to be relevant. Everyone played their part perfectly. Keaton was spot on and you have to give him credit for being in a movie which basically makes fun of his life and career. Emma Stone was great as his Druggie and very Skinny daughter. Edward Norton was hilarious, he hasn't been this good in years. Naomi Watts continues to be one of my favourites. Even Zach Galifianakis was very good playing a normal and serious character for a change. This movie will make you LOL and energise you. The effort to make it look like one continuous shot has to be admired. Birdman is basically a Schizophrenic mixture of Curb Your Enthusiasmn, Black Swan and that TV Show ""Smash"". 10/10"

And the super- pretentious monologues started to grate on me before long. If you're looking for sophisticated comedy in 2014, this isn't quite it. See The Grand Budapest Hotel, Dear White People, or even Gone Girl (technically a psychological thriller, but really funny even so). Even Boyhood, a great drama, has more wit and humor than Birdman."

","I think I have to review this film in two parts. Personally, I disliked it massively. I've watched all the nominees for best picture this year and this is my least favourite. The plot just didn't seem to go anywhere, I couldn't have cared less about the characters and their predicaments. I think Michael Keaton's performance has been hugely over-rated. As a dime a dozen movie-goer, I just didn't get it. However, this film has Academy fodder written all over it. I can definitely see why this film has sweeped awards this year. Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Zak Galifinakis were very good and the direction was also very Academy pleasing with many scenes done in just one shot. So, personally, I've ticked it off my list and I'll never be watching it again, but I'm not so naïve to not recognise it as a feat of cinematography. I certainly think its a movie made to try and win awards rather than for the likes of me to go and have a good time at the cinema."

","'Birdman' is without question a technical marvel that should be seen by anyone serious about film making. The cinematography is groundbreaking, I wouldn't be surprised if it were to spark a new wave of films trying to capture those magical moments of following actors around, while delivering lines for up to 10-15 minutes at a time. And of course the actors are completely up to the challenge, they give some very strong performances, especially Keaton (I think only Foxcatcher's Steve Carell can rival his performance for Best Actor). But while the movie had all of these fantastic technical achievements (acting, production design, and cinematography), the storyline seemed just a tad derivative for me. When I say that, I mean the classic, 'a has been is giving it one last shot at fame', but instead of the common sports story theme, its about an acting career. I think people are giddy over the fact that the movie basically describes Keaton's acting career and are giving the film slightly too much praise for that sole reason, had it been a different actor playing Riggan, the results would (in my mind) be less spectacular. When all is said and done, the movie didn't have much 'excitement' or 'thrills', it certainly had its moments, but not a strong driving force that kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next scene to come. <br/><br/>And as a final thought, 'Birdman' really got me reminiscing about, 'Black Swan' and 'The Wrestler', I won't list the similarities, but there are plenty of them (especially between 'Black Swan'). I prefer both of those films when compared to 'Birdman', I think they feature stronger central characters. But my point is that i'm unsure as to whether its a good thing that 'Birdman' inspired me to recollect my thoughts of similar movies and compare the bunch, or it was an unfortunate sin, because it took my thoughts away from 'Birdman'.<br/><br/>Full Review At: www.simplefilmreviews.com"

","Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a black comedy starring Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Stone and Edward Norton. It is one of the best acted films I've ever seen. The script was well written too. It is a clever satire on the behind-the- scenes worlds of both the film and Broadway industries.<br/><br/>Riggin Thomson (Michael Keaton) is a washed up film actor who once played an iconic superhero during the early 90s. Since leaving the role that made him famous, Riggin is now dealing with family problems, including his former drug addict daughter Sam (Emma Stone) and his strained relationship with his girlfriend Laura. He is also haunted by the voice of his character of Birdman and even hallucinates that he still has all of Birdman's superpowers. Determined to get his career and life back on track, Riggin decides to write, direct and star in his own Broadway play, overseen by his best friend and lawyer Jake (Zach Galifianakis) and starring alongside the arrogant method actor Mike (Edward Norton).<br/><br/>Michael Keaton was outstanding in this movie. It really feels like he is finally getting the recognition he deserves as an actor. Everyone else was great as well, including Edward Norton, Zach Galifianakis and Emma Stone. The cinematography is worth noting as well.

He should have gotten an Oscar instead of a clichéd performance by Eddie Redmayne. It also has many scenes that you cannot help laughing at. It also shows Hollywood isn't what it used to be. let's take a moment to look back on the 1970's. A time when you had tons of now classic films. When studios weren't scared of putting an ""R"" rating on things. Before everything was a superhero movie or a sequel. Hopefully Hollywood will realize they should have more original ideas after this and stop the comic book to screen and sequel/remake/prequel/franchise spree they're obsessed with lately.

Eventually, however, it turns out to just be about a guy who puts on a play that luckily becomes successful despite some bumps in the road. On top of that, the open ended finish invites us to interpret some of the stranger moments. Except that the movie told an almost straightforward, linear narrative. The effect was that I had no interest in digging deeper. I didn't care much about the characters or their success or failure.

The supporting cast are also great, Edward Norton plays a cocky actor who kind of represents the other side of the film industry and he is great in the role and his chemistry with keaton is great. Emma stone plays keatons daughter and she is great in the film because of she really creates a damaged character that has real problems with her father that we can understand. Zach galifanakis plays his best friend and he brings allot of humour to the role but also sometimes some seriousness that made him a great addition to this film. The story is great it truly deals with the problems with the film industry and how these blockbusters can affect an actors reputation. I love the way they portrayed this and makes this film really interesting and great social commentary. The script was great and combined humour and drama really well with all the dialogue working and making these characters feel really relatable. The style of this film is incredibly unique as from the beginning the film is made to look like one shot and it is great, it makes you feel like you are actually there with the characters and dealing with the problems with them. However, this film does have some pacing issues and it does hurt this film. Overall this is a fantastic film that I really think you should see."
"ahegde3149","9","1","6","13 February 2015"," Strong performances,mind-bending layered screenplay and technically brilliant
","Honestly I really don't understand why I ended up liking Birdman so much. The story feels as much ignorant as the alternate title.To begin with I truly was not able to stick myself with plausibility of the events shown in the film. Although I was quite able to relate to it metaphorically but the ending left me pretty much hanging. The story has a multi-layered point of view and the writers have done splendid job working on small little details which many casual viewers miss. Birdman is a kind of movie where you will spot something new on multiple viewings that you might have missed earlier.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Riggan (played masterfully by Micahel Keaton) who was once a famous superstar for playing superhero Birdman in blockbuster movies. Now past his middle age, Riggan seems to have lost his path in the film industry but his mind is not a phase to accept it. He is working on Broadway play which he himself is directing and writing apart from acting in it to showcase his talents. We get see his internal struggle countering with his alter-ego ""Birdman"" who makes him feel he is still a superstar and shouldn't waste his time on Broadway plays. Also he is facing family problems with distances between him and his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) constantly increasing. Starring in his play is a hardcore actor Mike (Edward Norton) whose dedications have no limit while he is acting and two more actress Leasley(Naomi Watts) and Laura(Andrea Riseborough) who have relatively smaller role. The entire star-studded cast was absolutely brilliant to watch and each of their characters is given ample amount of depth.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent and the entire film is edited to make it look like a one continuous shot (except once in the climax). The background score comprising mostly drums was also splendid. The multi-layered screenplay was very interesting and there were also many laugh-out-loud moments which was a really surprising considering the theme was more of dark comedy. I am not very clear about what rating to give right now, will have stronger opinion after re-watching it few times. Still with its stellar cast, weirdly intelligent script I must admit Birdman is one the finest films I have seen this year. <br/><br/>RATING:[4.5/5]"
"letitia-rosculet","9","1","6","9 February 2015"," Loved it!
","Birdman is an ambitious technical showcase powered by a layered story and outstanding performances from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton.We've seen the long-take trick before, perhaps most notably in Hitchcock's 1948 chamber thriller Rope, which masked five of its 10 cuts by slinking in close to its cast. But in Birdman, the effect's entirely different. Working with the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, Iñárritu turns the film into a high-wire act – live, unpredictable, light as air, yet also fatalistically locked on course. While it's going on, you're glued to the impossibility of what you're seeing. Once it's over, you can't believe what you saw."
"silentslayer18","8","1","6","6 February 2015"," Great movie, not perfect
","It certainly was some experience ! The way they shot the movie was just spectacular, you feel you are in the moment, keeps the pace up and the close to face camera work takes you right inside the movie. Performances, direction, cinematography were all hands down top notch no need to say anything about that, it was perfect, music was good too, I feel they maybe over did it a little, but it was very good. <br/><br/>There were few problems I had with the movie and therefore the 8/10. The ending first of all, if the movie ended ten minutes earlier I would have had no issues with it, though it continues and the final Emma Stone's expressions are confusing, not taking anything away from her performance though. Other thing was Edward Norton's unfinished story, they just dropped his character of, even though one might not feel it but it bothered me, because he had a very likable character. The final problem I had, or just the thing that annoyed me, was the genre. I started watching thinking it was a comedy/drama, like the genre says and they did the marketing that way. It was not a comedy, apart for three or four scenes, I didn't mind it but it annoyed a bit.<br/><br/>Apart from these little issues though it was an excellent experience, brilliant performances from everyone, mind blowing cinematography, and Oscar worthy direction."
"theunbeholden","8","1","6","6 February 2015"," The Ending and what it means to me
","This is a character study, meaning its a movie that centers around the events of mainly Keaton (with a bit of side stuff that I think is of some relevance that I can appreciate, others may only find it as plodding). The movie does a great job at setting up its premise of being about a aging Hollywood actor with lost stardom who had at some point refused to do another of his trademarked superhero movies (Birdman 4), and finding his life is yesterdays news and now using the theatre stage to bring credibility back, improving his reputation is everything, the point of all of this work and even spending out of own pocket to get this play to happen. It all feels real and this is I think a crucial element to making it work. Especially with Keaton playing the lead who seems to be living embodiment of this part. Firstly Keaton's performance is magnificent, hes juggling dealing with delusions/inner struggle, to acting through backstage drama through back and forth between Edward Norton and his wife and doing theatre styled acting on a stage. Its these differing styles that require a tremendous range. Edward Norton is great and makes for a good 'opposing character' that fuels Keaton's development, fighting for the spotlight almost as much character- wise as performance wise. Keaton hangs onto to his ambitions as his drive while Norton lives on stage, and that proves to be a good catalyst.<br/><br/>There are aspects of the movie where unlikely weird things happening (like that bed scene, lesbian kiss or Keaton being locked outside) sort of prepares you for whats coming and we go with it (even if you don't go with the ending). I've seen people speculate that hes in purgatory at the end but this doesn't seem right to me. Mainly because purgatory is a punishment and not something to be seen in a positive light.<br/><br/>The scene with his nose looking like a beak is supposed to be a symbol of him accepting that he is Birdman. It is the only real physical transformation he goes under, because there has to be a cue to the audience that hes becoming Birdman without outright telling everyone that (and give some tiny bit of leeway for other interpretations). The him flying away part is also a metaphor for him being happy and free now that he can be Birdman. The Twitter/Facebook account followers, PR stunts, all the fame and army of critics now (even the most distinguished critic) on his side to help him soar, and the daughter looking up to see him fly is a metaphor for even his family is now happy that he is Birdman. One giant over the top sellout, that cares about having everything & not about struggling with every aspect of his life anymore. He no longer cares about creating art & that voice that always asks him to be greater than he is, he has become the perfect version of himself that embraces the ridiculousness and power that it wields over people. He has in his mind accepted Birdman (and has many reasons why) BUT I interpret it in this way WITHOUT having him to be dead.<br/><br/>ie hes not actually in the bathroom or jumping out the window, hes just laying in bed with all of this manifesting in his mind, and we are seeing it metaphorically. <br/><br/>He made the critic feel, in the end. That crusty old bitch only wants what everyone else of bored lives want, a conveyor belt that manufacturers emotions that we can swallow and gladly play for (under the pretense of theatre, paintings/sculptures, opera, ie ""high art""). The scene where he critiques the critic by looking at her notes was just that, showing that making people feel is its own reward and over intellectualizing it can be pretentious (like one paragraph of actually being about the play and not needless comparisons or labels). <br/><br/>The movie is stuck between the idea of doing great performances for the sake of showing and arousing emotions and always wanting to do better or doing shallow things and getting everything for it (even real happiness it seems). Its a character study about important things happening in the life of Keaton or Birdman or parallels between them, but mainly a study of what us the audience want. Its clearly bringing us into this reality by constantly making us question whether its a movie or a theatre play we are witnessing, does it matter which it seems to adhere more to? Diegetic or non- diegetic sound, reality or non-reality. Constant shots where it seems like there are no breaks (there are breaks at various times and are quite well hidden, a few times quite deliberately obvious). Scenes that seem to want to become fiction (like the powers) but also scenes that want to come back to reality because that seems to be more important to us and at first more important to Keatons character. <br/><br/>In the end what we learn is that the critics want hyper reality, perhaps even to the extent of life imitating art and art imitating life (which here comes in the form of almost killing himself). What we want may just be Birdman, the stage just seems to be a place Keaton and the others play out their own drama & constantly struggle with aspects of their own lives between family, creating art and the sellout culture of entertainment/financial success. Keaton is freed and perhaps we are the shown as the shallow ones for giving into his Birdman or.. Batman you could say :)"

","I really enjoyed the movie, it's very well made and I can say is one of the best of this year nominees.<br/><br/>The performance of Michael Keaton is exceptional and Edward Norton has an amazing work done here, it feels the chemistry between the two of them and in every scene you can feel the tension of two great actor about to crash.<br/><br/>When Emma Stone talks with Keaton about he been nothing in the grand scheme of the universe... that's a performance waiting for an Oscar and one of my favorites of the whole movie.<br/><br/>There is one theme that becomes very repetitive over the whole movie I can't tell you what it is but you probably will find it very early. The other thing I can find very irritating is the background battery music sometimes is OK and I find myself enjoying it but sometimes I just want to kill the drummer.<br/><br/>Overall I love it and I hope it becomes one of those classic you have to watch to say that you know about movies."
"badajoz-1","6","1","6","31 January 2015"," Not As Clever As It Thinks It Is!
","A good film, a decent attempt at trying to make a 'Man In Search Of His Own Identity' movie like Bergman, Fellini, Antonioni etc did in the 60s and 70s. It does it through the painful struggles to stage a play on Broadway allied to the agonies and ego of a washed up, former superhero actor trying to go legit. The medium of the last chance for a fading thespian has been done before, but not for a while. Remember Bette Davis and Ann Baxter going head to head in the early 50s? What makes this film stand out is the artifice of the film (until the very end)apparently being shot in one long continuous take! It works brilliantly, but overpowers the film. The script is good in parts, but is repetitive and fairly mundane with little depth. Actorly tantrums and one-upmanship do not make for a two hour movie these days. The acting is good, but bound by the limits of the story, eg Edward Norton's character is real on stage but all an act off it - and we are supposed to care! The film takes pot shots at Hollywood - how brave! - but apart from repeatedly going on about cartoon superhero movies and celebrity there is little here but a moan that falls short of a rant. The 'right on' bits about the impact of social media seem arch and merely included for the movie to look relevant to today. But this film is trying to do something worthy, and everyone, except the scriptwriters, are doing their best. It is worth seeing but too high hopes and the hype will leave you flat."
"osj2507","8","1","6","31 January 2015"," Wonderful Weird
","It is hard finding the right words to write about this film, it is just something you have to experience for yourself, maybe you will like it and maybe it is just too weird for some. It is a very weird film in many ways, the camera angels and flows are something new, individual and intertwined stories, strange compositions and difficult personalities are just some of the things we experience in this film.<br/><br/>It is very well done, has a strange twist of irony, mentioning cinematically and society related references and have reality distant illusions, it is all in all a great mix of fun, weird, fact and strange :)<br/><br/>The small universe or the way it is presented for the viewer is great, we mainly follow the main person, earlier movie actor Birdman, some of it is his thoughts, some is inside his head and how he perceive things and some is from the views of other people. It is all shown in this one-take kind of camera motion and that gives us a notion off being close to these people and moving in the same space as them.<br/><br/>In many ways this film is just good craftsmanship, cinematically, scenery, mood and music plays well together, especially the last part, the music and sounds have an impact on us and the actors, we meet the musician in the film and he is part of the whole experience, it is just one of the extra weird things in this small universe.<br/><br/>It is very entertaining and you sometimes sit there with open mouth through longer scenes of the film (maybe through it all, I didn't notice), it is entertaining and exciting and you have to follow closely both to get it all, but also to just enjoy the strangeness and different style."
"biont","9","1","6","23 January 2015"," Great theatrical roller-coaster presented in a very unusual way
","When I first saw this masterpiece in one of the Latvian movie theaters, I was much impressed by the seamless transitions between scenes, which make it look like the whole movie was shot in one take. Really impressive and unusual. It adds realism to the picture. But not the kind of realism, that you get quickly tired of, when the camera is all shaky and stuff. In this one the camera went smooth all the way. So, it's a pleasure to watch from visual perspective.<br/><br/>Then comes the filling of this eye-pleasing candy. And I tell you, it's so fresh, so full of life and humorous, vivid characters that you quickly fall in love with. I really enjoyed those scenes, where you get to be on stage, feel the actors' play being revealed in front of you. Really cool. Then there's humor spilled in almost every scene.<br/><br/>So, you get dipped into a constantly changing river of theatrical action, very modern though, I have to add. Because theater can be often associated with something from the past. But this is a very modern movie, very much about the modern days of YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. It's easy to connect with all that's shown.<br/><br/>I went to see it for the second time with my girlfriend. This time I thought it was even more fun. Great job by all the actors and splendid directing by Mr. Iñárritu.<br/><br/>It is indeed an unusual movie. If I would have to describe, what's it about, I'd say it's about a bird that lives in us, waiting to spread its wings and elevate us from our crawling up into the beauty of sky fly."
"Seraphion","6","1","6","23 January 2015"," Great technicalities and acting, yet the story only revolves on itself
","Riggan Thomson was a big Birdman superhero movie star from twenty years ago. Now in an effort to get back in the game, he writes, directs and acts in his own Broadway play adaptation of Raymond Carver's story ""What We Talk When We Talk About Love"". But his old Birdman had nested in him and formed a split personality voice, cursing him for not going back to play as Birdman again. When a co-star Ralph gets an accident, he single- handedly changed him for Mike, a great-ambitious-but-acts-like-a-snob actor. His producer/lawyer/best friend Jake constantly reminds him of the financial problems they have, including having to talk Riggan down so that he keep Mike in the production after Mike crashes a rehearsal preview. On the other hand, Riggan has to constantly keep the confidence level of Leslie high. Leslie is a Broadway newcomer actress, who had a thing with Mike sometime a while ago. Riggan's daughter Sam was recently out of drug rehab and currently works as his assistant. His ex-wife Sylvia is constantly nagging him about Sam. His girlfriend and co-star Laura gives him the news of her pregnancy. And not the least of his problems is the NY Times critic Tabitha, who threatens to give him a bad review due to hating everyone who sells out to Hollywood.<br/><br/>Riggan himself is the type of man who shuns internet developments. He doesn't have any blog or Twitter or even Facebook. One night while only in his underwear, Riggan gets locked outside the theater's back entrance. He walks all the way through Times Square to the main entrance, resulting in amateur YouTube videos that go viral almost instantly. Riggan finds out that Mike and Sam are having a relationship. The Birdman persona keeps nagging him with verbal harassment and giving him hallucinations. At last Riggan's play enter the opening night, and the crowd really likes it. After a talk with Sylvia, Riggan goes back to do the final scene where he shoots himself. Previously Mike had complained about the gun looking unrealistic, so this time Riggan uses a real pistol, shooting his nose off. He ends up at the hospital. But he regains his success with thousands following his Twitter Sam set up. Sylvia is there with him. Jake is also happy for his success. Sam comes to visit. The play went well with Laura and Leslie acting great.<br/><br/>The story for me has a nice setup base. It starts with very potential points that deserve more development. The combination of all those problems Riggan has is just sitting there waiting to be developed and explored upon more. But instead the movie just hovers its way around Riggan with some little bits of time when the movie centers on Sam and Mike. Despite the eventual relatively happy ending, Riggan's cocktail of problems don't get any more scene showing them being actively solved.<br/><br/>What really makes this movie deserves its praises and credits are those meticulously designed and executed technical aspects. The editing design that makes this whole movie feeling like almost entirely a one-shot is indeed an exceptional work of art. The camera angle play and movements are just plain ecstatic. We see this trick once or twice on many movies. But Birdman just makes us see this all throughout.<br/><br/>The acting is also an exceptional work. All the cast responded very well on those close ups, pouring all the seriousness into their acting. I agree to the voices saying that this is Michael Keaton's best performance to date. His expressions and mannerisms successfully made Riggan a very unpredictable character. Edward Norton as Mike also acted out greatly with his body language. Zach Galifianakis at a serious role proves he still has a lot to offer. Naomi Watts, Emma Stone really nailed it at her close up emotional scene. Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan really add significantly to this movie.<br/><br/>For me Birdman (2014) deserves a 6 out of 10 score, while a recommendation is only a so-so for me. It's indeed not for everyone. I find this movie more entertaining from its technical and acting prowess than its actual storyline."
"Billmooney1","6","1","6","8 January 2015"," Good But Certainly No Masterpiece
","I can't help but feel that Birdman is going to be one of the most over rated movies of the year if not the decade because the critics are praising this film far beyond what it deserves, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Fact of the matter is that I found Birdman to be quite good but no more than that, the cast is good, the performances are very good, the idea is pretty original and it's certainly something we don't see very often so that's refreshing. There are a number of pretty funny scenes as well which keep you going but ultimately there are plenty of flaws which won't appeal to the casual cinema goer.<br/><br/>I found the script in general to be a little weak, I can't think of any particularly brilliant quotes from the movie and if it's supposed to be a comedy I heard only sporadic laughter in the cinema over the course of 120mins. Now I'm not generally a fan of ridiculous comedies like the Scary Movie saga but if that's your thing then stay well away from Birdman. Also I found the background drums soundtrack to be a little over used and irritating by times and the emotional scenes I found to be a little out of place and boring, particularly Emma Stone's.<br/><br/>The ending is a little bit bizarre as well but I suppose that was to be expected considering the arty nature of the film, but again I found it weak rather than powerful, amusing or even significant.<br/><br/>So to conclude, I think this is more a movie for the critics, arty people and the middle aged who've experienced success and failure so can relate to the story more than younger people. That's not to say don't go to see Birdman, it is worth watching but don't be fooled by the reviews, it's nowhere near as good as the critics are saying."

","I loved this film. Reminded me of a contemporary All About Eve.I particularly enjoyed the action in the shabby corridors and actors rooms which created a rounded visual and psychological backdrop to the action on stage.The tension between ego and love was both intelligent and very funny.<br/><br/>The unraveling of the many threads of personal stories within this film was particularly satisfying, as I enjoy but don't often see both the public and private sphere equally realized. <br/><br/>Lastly,the mirroring of the two leading male roles with probable real life attributes added another playful strand to laugh at and engage with."
"timmyhollywood","8","1","6","27 December 2014"," I guess you call it ""meta""
","I'm not as hip as they come, but I guess you call Birdman a ""meta"" film. And that's why I really liked it. Watching actors portray actors can be wonderful. Very meta. A highlight of the film, for me, is when Edward Norton and Michael Keaton are playing two stage actors playing two roles of two characters a play and they're working out the scene. Amazing to see them peel the layers and dig deeper and get to the heart of it, find the raw truth, and so on.<br/><br/>The long steadicam takes are impressive. Zack Galifianakis, who I've been a fan of since he played his piano and delivered his churlish stand up comedy, was a real joy. Emma Thompson looks like a Disney character, her eyes are so big and her little nose so perfect. Oh and she's a terrific actor. They all are. Naomi Watts turns in a great performance as well. And the birdman thing, you know, awesome to hear that stereophonic voice booming in the protagonist's ears.<br/><br/>Meta, because this movie is about Michael Keaton, who played Batman once. Isn't it? A little bit? Is the script a love letter to him, is the film designed as his vehicle? I don't know for sure, and I'm too lazy to research it, but I think so. Besides, it works.<br/><br/>So all this said, I don't know why Birdman didn't completely blow me away. I was engrossed, I laughed a TON, and marveled at the multiverse it presented. It was both a visceral and intellectual enjoyment. So why isn't it one of my favorite movies? Too much hype? Too many expectations? Just a smidge too ""artsy"" for me? Or maybe it was because my wife wasn't that into it - it wasn't her thing. The magical realism was there for her, but, she's not an actor-type like me. So, I dunno.<br/><br/>The scene with him running through Time's Square is pretty great. Anyway, I'll shut up now."

","Hollywood is full of itself, and no movie is as self-serving as Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance. This film is one big ego trip, and its mere premise fails to make the audience feel sorry for main character Riggan, played by Michael Keaton. The disappointing ending adds to the viewer's anger with the selfish Riggan, whose biggest gripe in life is that his stardom has faded. With that said, the movie has entertainment value. Tremendous acting jobs by Keaton, Edward Norton as the self-absorbed Broadway star, and Emma Stone as the recovering addict daughter (all deservingly nominated for Academy Awards) and the illusion of the movie being filmed in one continuous take make Birdman worth viewing, and makes director Alejandro Inarritu deserving of his Best Director nomination."
"derma-244-783445","9","1","7","20 February 2015"," Icarus of La Mancha in Broadway
","At the beginning a half naked protagonist (Keaton) appears levitating. I think these are two key elements of this film. We can wonder whether it is possible levitation in otherwise realistic pictures (Iñarritu's films are well known for their realism). And this reminds me of the narrative device for the end of Vittorio De Sica's classic film Miracolo in Milano; although Birdman subverts that order and takes the risks since its beginning. Could be called magic realism? Only up to reach half of the film. But I will leave the levitation superpower aside: is nudity, as a metaphor, other important theme. Because this story narrates the creative process of a theater company in the performance of a play (an adaptation of Carver's What we talk about when we talk about love) we will understand that undressing is the most valued virtue for an actor. <br/><br/>The protagonist levitates and bares. (The other actors in the play bare as well: even Edward Norton, in the same way that Keaton, appears in his undies in much of the film, but he does not levitate.) And after the first half of the movie his emotional strip has made it clear that the adapter-producer-actor was a fail as a husband, and is a failure in his current affair and, above all, he is a failure as a father. But a story rests not only in what a character is considered to be, but also in what he wants to demonstrate that he is. In this regard the plot of Birdman is a kind of tribute to Don Quixote. Not only the plot and theme (the struggle of one insane ambition against the surrounding reality), but also the overlapping of narrative plans. Because our Mexican brothers are among the best understanders of the Spanish literature masterpiece, Iñarritu has perfected a story in which the narrative of insanity mixes with the reality. And it can also be considered a cervantine plot because another fiction (the play) is presented in such a way that the film plot and the play plot sometimes mix. <br/><br/>The way chosen for filming creates a feeling of continuity by the simulation of a continuous shot. This fake continuous shot, kind of journey through labyrinthine corridors of the theater with a hypnotic soundtrack, provokes deep empathy for the actor-cavalier. The protagonist, after having stripped, has to deal with all adversity in his quest to demonstrate he is a genuine actor, and he will face a quixotic fate. I could advance (a kind of bizarre spoiler) that Miracolo in Milano will appear again."

","""A thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing.""<br/><br/>Birdman is a film about a washed up actor, who was once famous for starring as Birdman (Superhero), and his battle with himself and those around him during the final days of his Broadway play premiere. <br/><br/>This film boasts an immense ensemble of talent, and you definitely get the result. Micheal Keaton, Emma Stone, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Zack Galifianakis and some others all deliver amazing performances. It is truly a feat to see everyone just acting their best.And at the center of it all is Micheal Keaton and his career's best performance. He was awesome. Period. <br/><br/>Because of awesome performances, every scene was a joy to behold, the dialogue delivery was great, the dialogue itself was great. Another thing I really enjoyed about this film was that how its story paralleled with Micheal Keaton's and Edward Norton's real life. Micheal Keaton is most known for his role in Tim Burton's classic Batman film and its sequel and his character in the film has a similar scenario. Edward Norton is quite famously known for being difficult to work with on set and his character in the film is definitely like it too. Gives a nice meta feel to the film. <br/><br/>The greatest achievement of the film though is its cinematography. I was completely floored by it. The whole movie feels like a single long take. Technically, it consists of a couple of extra long takes joined together by great editing to make it seem like a one take. Either way, I have never seen longer takes then in this movie. And it just feels really raw and realistic, like you're actually there. I can't imagine how difficult it must have been to deliver long dialogues without cuts. Makes you appreciate the acting even more. Kudos to the cinematography team. <br/><br/>With everything so top notch in this film, the story itself felt like the weakest part to me. I'm not saying it was bad or anything, but it just didn't felt fulfilling. Maybe they had to sacrifice the story for the shooting style, felt like that to me. When you have everything else great, something not near their level sticks out like a sore thumb. <br/><br/>Regardless, it was a great movie overall, definitely a sight to behold.

This is not that kind of film.<br/><br/>This movie portrays the life of a somewhat manic actor/director, Riggan who puts his life and career on the line when he opens a piece of theatre on Broadway. Whilst the theatre piece seems to come together relatively well, Riggan struggles externally and internally with the life he has previously led, namely that he's stigmatised by a movie character he once played, Birdman.<br/><br/>This movie is an interesting insight into the goings-on of a group of people who are part of an ambitious Broadway theatre piece.<br/><br/>The movie offers a magical combination of great acting, great production design, original storyline & script, and a clever style of filming that seamlessly connects each and every scene. This movie is a piece of film that is imaginatively and intellectually engaging.<br/><br/>Birdman is a one-of-a-kind movie and if you're a movie lover you would be stupid to miss it."

"jolly_miller","7","1","7","6 February 2015"," An Explosion of Masterclass Acting in a Ball of Self Indulgence
","The film has been released with the backing and support of numerous film festivals. And like all films that have a backing of such festivals, the film can go one of two ways; a huge success or a massive flop. And the consensus seems split on this one. With many critics giving the film a solid ten, the general public seem to have missed the hype and award the film with a generous one star. Like all films that make it big with the festivals, there is an air of pretentiousness about it, and the critics' backing only concretes the pretentiousness. There is no denying that it is a work of art, from the longest single shots in a film, to the superb acting, it's certainly artistic to say the least. But like all works of art, the film is indulged in its own self-indulgences to the highest level. The film follows Micheal Keaton's character Riggan, as he invests everything he has, both financially and emotionally into creating a successful Broadway show. Riggan is trying to shake off the superhero role and peak of his career in 1992. (This resonates Keaton's past, as he also played the superhero role of Batman in 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns'. 1992 was also the year that Batman Returns was released). Birdman was once the character that drove Riggan to success, but now taunts him, driving him further from reality into the depths of his insecure self. And the film shows his breakdown, which from the start is justified. His actor is injured on opening night, and Mike played by Edward Norton, has a stern acting method that includes getting drunk on stage and trying to have actual intercourse in an attempt to bring reality to the play. Riggan goes through enough to shake the foundations of any secure and confident person. But Riggan is clearly not the everyman, and because of that, we can't sympathise with him. We are witness to some truly superb acting though. Keaton has never been more believable and Norton steals every scene. Zach Galifianakis plays a different role to his try-hard comedian. And although Emma Stone is worryingly slim, she's attentive throughout, playing the moody rebellious teenager without taking the attention away from the scene. But with such flawless acting, imaginative shooting style and a brilliant music score that only consists of drums, is this too good to be true? Well I don't wholly trust the film, and I'm left uncertain of my thoughts towards it. I stand by my earlier point that it is completely self indulgent, and although the story doesn't have limitations in its emotional journey, nothing really happens. The ending makes you scream at the screen. Why didn't they end it seconds before Stone's unnecessary and story changing smile. <br/><br/>The film in parts doesn't take itself too seriously. With jibes at current actors such as Robert Downy Jr and Ryan Gosling, who I assume were aware of the light banter. But the biggest person in on the joke is Edward Norton, who's renowned for being just as difficult behind the screen as his character shown on screen. Norton's constant reluctance to just 'act' in a play and obsession with delving into the method actor apparently echoes through his past directors. <br/><br/>No question about it, the film is a work of art and revolutionary in it's filming style. Swimming up stream against the commercially safe films, and films that do this tend to be deservedly or not inundated with awards."

","While I agree with the many reviewers who compile criticisms of the movie, I find myself reflecting instead on the role the music played in the movie. I don't recall a movie where the music including songs, orchestra pieces, and, sometimes, just beats were used to tell essential parts of the story. There are plenty of movies with great soundtracks or masterful musical themes but something entirely different is at work here.<br/><br/>Appreciating what was done with the music got me through the many difficult sequences of dialog although I admit there were some sparkling scenes such as Edward Norton's first rehearsal with Michael Keaton on stage.<br/><br/>I don't know where this type of movie-making can go but I'm very interested to see more."

","If there is one word to sum up this movie it is ""pretentious"". It is a comedy that isn't funny, a drama that isn't serious and a satire that mostly hits back on itself. It is impressive more than enriching and, expect for the contemporary comment on Hollywood and showbiz, there isn't much of an underlying message to take note of here.<br/><br/>The redeeming strengths of the film lies in the acting and cinematography that are absolutely top notch. Keaton is giving the performance of a lifetime (and was perfect for the role for obvious reasons), Norton is back in American History X mode, Emma Stone nails the part as Sam and shows that she is someone to be taken seriously in the future. Even Zach Galifianakis is showing new sides of himself and gives a very well rounded performance overall.<br/><br/>Alejandro Iñárritu is both writer, director and cinematographer of this movie, it is is by all accounts his baby. And when it comes to directing and cinematography it is a real tour de force, perhaps a bit showy and distracting in places but nonetheless extremely well done and very impressive. If you're a study of cinematography this is a film you should see.<br/><br/>The problem lies in the writing, or rather the story and fundamental driving force of the movie. The acting hits a lot of high notes but in the end there is little to take away; the story could have gone a million different ways but it all ends up being is one big poke at Hollywood, showbiz and people who happen to like marvel blockbusters.<br/><br/>At it's heart it is a tabloid type movie and has no deeper fundamental meaning than the industry it is trying to poke holes in. It is a film which I'm glad to have watched once, the cinematography and acting alone is beautiful, but it is not a film I will soon give a second viewing.<br/><br/>At the end of the day this very film is like a movie critic; it criticizes and judges the works of others but has no lasting message of its own."

Be it, Keaton, or Norton, or Stone. Everyone delivered their best. Here, there are lot of actors who would be blindly stated as Hollywood equivalent actors.

I found it hard, to see where the scenes were cut, and where the editing was happening. The no. of scenes in this movie would be easily more, than your average movie. Things were happening so damn fast. Simply put, this would stand as the example of modern day film making. Crisp scenes, fast screenplay, razor sharp editing. <br/><br/>This is all you got in the movie. There is nothing else to talk about. When I came out of the movie hall, I was totally disappointed. I was feeling left out and craving for more. The emotions are not so deep. The characters are confusing. There is no life in this movie. And, when I knew that Interstellar, and Nightcrawler were overlooked in the award ceremonies for this movie, I felt really bad. Disappointed.

"AbhiMathews","8","1","7","1 February 2015"," Lose one sense, gain another
","Perception is a difficult trait to assess. Sometimes it truly is hard to comprehend another person's viewpoint, while at times it's simply exaggerated. Birdman is Riggan's egocentric persona, or so it appears. A man who lives without identity--who only remembers a false sense of worth when he was in the tabloids--clings on to Birdman to stay relevant. It's a major psychological movement to realize the world does not revolve around you (for some) since it's on this path we call life that we try to add some worth.<br/><br/>Edward Norton and Emma Stone performed exceptionally in this film and really provided a great punch. Their stories and otherwise daring demeanours ensured every minute was a stimulating one. The overall story is of the contemporary existential crisis, and how identity is such an allusive topic at times, even to ourselves. It's the moulding of our fate (or lack thereof) that many struggle to accept, and Birdman does a great job in showing different outlooks on life.<br/><br/>At times we have a false perception of ourselves. This may appear as a distorted reality to some or a safeguard for others' egos. Nonetheless, it is this sense of understanding and self-acceptance Birdman struggles with that leads to peace."

","An aging actor, played by Michael Keaton, tries to sort his priorities out. His struggle with a multitude of things ongoing forms the core of the movie.

Whether it is the people to deal with or careers or themselves, the fight is very evident. Each is in his/her own rat race to some place that they don't even know of. Ed Norton plays the perfect foil to Keaton in the movie. Lastly, this movie is not just about actors or Broadway or Hollywood or the critics. This is about life, mine and yours, what we seek from it, and whether we appreciate what we have found or we still keep looking for something else.

","Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's ""Birdman"" is a masterpiece on many levels. First of all, a very unusual camera technique is used to make the entire film feel like one continuous shot, which is very engrossing. Secondly, the soundtrack consists almost entirely of scattered, dissonant jazz percussion, which gives the film an unhinged feel. It really is on a level with the one in Kubrick's ""The Shining"". Thirdly, all of the lead actors give solid, occasionally great, performances.<br/><br/>But what makes this film fall short of being a masterpiece, oddly enough, is Inarritu's directing and writing. The frequent use of surrealism is intriguing, but it doesn't seem to have much meaning or purpose. The story is thin and exists only in service of the performances. Nevertheless, ""Birdman"" is an experience you will remember for some time, and I urge you to see it.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Reviewers Note: My entire review was erased somehow, so this is a shortened version.<br/><br/>Birman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is the type of innovated filmmaking that feels so fresh and necessary in todays age of Hollywood. I think the argument of the film being conceited is valid at times. But Alejandro González Iñárritu just does a tremendous job at creating a new story for us all to remember and recognize come awards season.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton plays a washed up actor who used to play a superhero. Only he's trying to reinvent his career and life on stage at the same time as attempting to rekindle his family life. The film comments a lot on where Hollywood is today, and basically how far we have come. Is that a good thing? Well in the directors eyes it seems it is not. Superhero films have taken over film, but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing. People love watching them and they are consistently some of the most critically acclaimed films of the year. So in that sense I think Birdman got it wrong.<br/><br/>The film does take full advantage of it's cast and crew however. Each cast member feeds perfectly well off each other and translates into several Oscar caliber performances. Iñárritu nails the directing, and Lubezki will and should win another cinematography Oscar.

"uptonian","9","1","7","23 January 2015"," Review: Birdman (2014) - A Weird Epic
","""See, Birdman is like Icarus..""<br/><br/>Riggan Thompson doesn't matter anymore. At least that's what his daughter, Sam (Emma Stone) says. The washed-up star, played by Michael Keaton, can't seem to reclaim the glory he felt whilst portraying the superhero that ""paved the way,"" for the influx of comic book films we see today: Birdman. Riggan is staging a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, which he has adapted for the stage and plans also to direct and star in. This is Riggan's ticket back into the spotlight. It's been twenty-something years since his stint as Birdman, and it's his time to reclaim the glory.<br/><br/>Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is most widely known for his films Babel (2006) and Biutiful (2010), two very somber films, so naturally, when I saw he was doing a film with Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Edward Norton, and Zach Galiafinakis I was quite surprised. More intrigued than anything. I've been waiting to see this film since I first became aware of it. It's been a long wait, but I finally caught a screening, and I'm so glad I did. Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a delight; a revelation. It is a resurgence of art in cinema. Weird, funny, and emotionally engaging, Birdman will be remembered for the ages.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film needs to be mentioned. I have long loved Emmanuel Lubezki. Ever since I first saw Children of Men (2006), I was hooked on his style. They way he shoots is astounding. He has an appreciation for the Golden Age of Cinema and it is evident in every single shot of his films. Lubezski's use of natural light is what draws most people in, but for me it has always been about his long takes. To me, nothing is more immerse than a camera that is able to linger in the action without cutting. It gives the viewer a frame of reference and commits to maintain it, engaging the viewer. Here, my appreciation of this only served to make me love this film even more. The entire film, save a very brief portion near the end, is processed to seem as one take. We move from location to location seamlessly for the two hour running time. It's a beautiful end result.<br/><br/>Keaton plays the Riggan Thompson / Birdman character seemingly with ease. It's so refreshing to see him back on the screen and doing so well for himself. He really does capture the hilarity of it the narrative. Ego and legacy take center stage. The struggle of this film is one of a man who struggles to remain relevant and potent in today's culture. Even with an ego large enough to persuade him to hallucinations of telekinesis and levitation, Riggan Thompson is looking for his place in the limelight. He wants to be important again.<br/><br/>Emma Stone and Edward Norton are also superb. Their interactions feel nothing short of genuine, and provide a heartfelt addition to the main narrative of The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance. This film was, personally, one of my favorites from the Oscar Season. I had such a good time watching it, and despite the profane language, I couldn't shake the feeling of Classical Cinema. Film can be such a majestic thing when it is appreciated and nurtured as an art. We have that here, with Birdman. I see this film joining the Criterion Collection one day soon."

If you have any of the above characteristics, you might have the ability to become an actor.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton was fabulous and should win the Academy Award.

","This is a very unique film by a talented director. The film is a behind of the scenes of a play going on. It is filmed to make it look liked the whole movie was done in one shot.

She just got out rehab and is his assistant. The whole film is a backstage pass to what its like in the theatre. It is fascinating to watch. Edward Norton is also great as Riggan's rival. Both actors Norton and Keaton haven't done great movies for a while. So art is really imitating life here. Keaton is a tour de tour force. You can really feel Riggan's desperation to make a comeback. Keaton has for sure made a comeback after this film. The dialogue and conversations are really fun to listen to. The film is very entertaining and well crafted.

","Birdman was one of the most ambitious films of the year and Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu managed to pull off this very unique film about a former movie star trying to get back in the spotlight through a Broadway film. At first that is what it seems it is going to focus on but it does touch on more deeper meanings involving his family and his relationships with himself and those around him. Michael Keaton was definitely the best part of the film, he portrayed Riggan so well that i began to believe that this could have actually been a real person. He showed so much passion in playing this character that you really get sucked in to his amazing performance. The supporting cast i felt also did a pretty good job but did not shine as brightly as Keaton. <br/><br/>Another highlight from the film has to be the ingenious and mesmerising method used to film it. The one-shot sweeping camera technique used gave this film a very different feel than many other films and really let you follow these characters and get to see them in all different environments without all of the jarring cuts. The performances as well as shooting technique are what make this film what it is. But that was still not enough for me to absolutely love this movie, the overall tone of the film didn't really work for me, i understood why they went for a dark and comedic yet also dramatic tone as there were some sections that i really enjoyed but for the most part i couldn't really enjoy the entire film as much as i wanted to. Despite not being able to really enjoy this film as much as i had hoped, i still got to see one of the performances of the year in one of the more different films of 2014, if you are an admirer of some different, quality film this may be the film for you - 7.6"
"drqshadow-reviews","7","1","7","14 January 2015"," Challenging, Intriguing and Inventive, But Also Presumptive and Overbearing
","Michael Keaton leads the charge as a teetering schizophrenic actor, struggling to find validation on Broadway after a long, expired run as a glossy Hollywood blockbuster-dweller. On a purely technical level, it's astounding. Precisely edited to appear as though the whole thing were executed in one extremely long take, it's a mesmerizing experience, profoundly different and expertly crafty when the timeline needs to leap forward. It's dazzlingly acted, too, with Keaton delivering a masterful performance alongside noteworthy supporting work from Ed Norton, Emma Stone and (to my surprise) a very versatile Zach Galifianakis. The moral lessons are laid on thick, though, and too often it feels like we're being lectured for daring to indulge in the kind of loathsome fun that drove our lead to this strange brand of mania. One scene in particular, Keaton's confrontation with a stuffy critic before opening night (who glares right into the camera before storming off in a cloud of self-righteousness) plays like a direct scolding of the audience. Maybe theatre purists will take this as a firm voice of reason, the rare call of someone who finally *gets* it, but to me it came off as tremendously stuck-up and pretentious. I can't deny there's a lot to enjoy here, and it's a clear arrival for auteur Alejandro González Iñárritu, but I also can't help wondering how much better it would be without that permeating air of superiority."

(The nose we see after he removes the bandage is his delusional mind, telling him that ""things aren't so bad"", or something like that.)) And, in all likelihood, his daughter kills herself too. She always had a suicidal penchant for jumping off buildings (for very similar reasons -- lack of love from daddy), and when she finally partakes in Keaton's flying birdman delusions, that's the sign that she's dead too. She jumped.<br/><br/>I cried during his last performance when he shoots himself. It resonates extremely deeply with me -- being fake, unloved, an actor in a play, ""an idiot, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage"". Deep.<br/><br/>The dissonant discordant chaotic drumming music was genius -- perfect for the constant irritation and discomfort of having to lie and fake it.<br/><br/>There were many times when we weren't able to tell the acting from ""reality"". Genius. Eg. a bunch of times during the play rehearsals when we think that he's gone berserk and actually kills himself, or when he fakes having been beaten by his dad with Norton. And Norton does this too a few times. There were also many times when they were hyper-real. Eg. Norton sharing his fears and insecurities about masculinity (erection problems), and lack of connection (unable to be honest off stage), and Keaton with his fears about being a forgotten has-been, and being vulnerable (walking in underwear in a crowded city). These precious glimpses of reality were the guideposts to help figure out exactly what is going on. If it wasn't for them, the film would be a lot harder to penetrate, because the rest of the acting was kinda believable -- I could have convinced myself that it was simply about a guy with a playful imagination struggling to become a famous actor/director.<br/><br/>The second-guessing about whether what we just saw was real or fake was really trippy.

This entire movie is cheated to look like one continuous shot throughout the whole movie. I feel like its fitting, since the movie is based around a play being introduced, which if you think about it, is like making a movie over one shot.<br/><br/>Another great thing about this movie was the soundtrack. The soundtrack gave the movie a great tone with most of the music used was made by drums, and it really helps set the tone of the movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, I feel like this movie is just outstanding in every sense of the word. It was perfectly acted, shot, edited, and directed. And its my personal winner of choice.<br/><br/>Final Score: 10/10"

","I pushed the exit door of the local theater hall just a few hours ago. I'd just say I got one of the best cinematic experiences in my life. Birdman is a totally must-see masterpiece. Exciting atmosphere merges you with characters' feelings and thoughts. Even the sound of arrhythmic drums precisely represents the mental state of Riggan Thomson, the main character. Moreover, the motion picture has its unique way of filming. Camera moves smoothly following actors all the way through with minimum of cuts. It makes you feel soaring somewhere nearby the action. Continuous walks through the long corridors look fascinating.<br/><br/>Let's start from scratch. Movie is a story about a one-role actor playing a super hero called ""The Birdman"". Riggan is prisoned in Birdman's skin not only as an actor but mentally. Despite of that he imagines himself flying above everyone else Thomson has absolutely no urge to participate in a further shitty blockbuster. Nowadays he's trying to get rid of prejudices and The Birdman as a part of himself. Riggan believes that staring in and directing a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver tale would redeem love among the admirers of true art. Meanwhile, the film contains intelligent humor and alluring industry facts.<br/><br/>The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance (Birdman) is a dark comedy masterpiece about an actor performing the act of his own life."

","I have just seen the film. I would love to rate it but I can't. Did I like it? I don't know. The sequence shot is disturbing and interesting at the same time. Actors performance is awesome and Edward Norton is the key of the film. The superhero thing, in my opinion, was not necessary. If they wanted to recreate -not only in the play, as I realized- Carver's short stories, Carver's way of telling the truth, narrating real life, the superhero thing is something that, OK, it appeals the spectator, but doesn't fit in there.<br/><br/>However, this is something everybody must watch. New ways of telling stories is what we need, developing the amazing invention cinema was."
"samkan","8","1","8","9 December 2014"," But For Excess A Contender
","It is difficult for a film to live up to the amount of critical hype ascribed to BIRDMAN. I certainly cannot say I didn't enjoy the film, I don't want to offer some pretentious insight and I'm certainly not a seasoned theater or movie critic. Allow me to lay it on the line in a straightforward manner: BM should have stuck to Keaton's character entirely; e.g., without the scenes containing daughter, girlfriends, etc. The film could have done well without the weird ""powers"" - we get the point that Riggan THINKS he's superhuman, all the mind-over-matter tossing about is distracting. The film would have been fine coming in around 85 minutes, trimming the underwear walk and two of it's three endings. In a nutshell, the makers have a smart product in BM and with discipline and restraint could have easily walked away with this year's Oscar. As it stands, BM gives new definition to ostentatious."

"russellingreviews","7","1","8","18 November 2014"," Birdman - Depressing brilliance 4 stars
","All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players <br/><br/>William Shakespeare <br/><br/>Walking into the cinema... Birdman has the critics raving... That is usually a deterrent for people to go to see a film. Critical acceptance is usually code for 'art film'. Too bad, because this film looks like a masterpiece. The question has to be, can Michael Keaton carry this film? <br/><br/>Art House* rating: 4 stars Family rating: This film is for mature audiences only. It has mature themes and language that should be taken into consideration before viewing. <br/><br/>Riggan Thomas (Michael Keaton) is a world renowned actor who played the iconic super hero know as ""The Birdman."" It provided him the opportunity to live out his dreams of acting and brought his life an enviable fame. Eventually the fame and fortune disappeared and he is attempts to get his career back on track. Ultimately, he wants the respect of the thespian community and hopes to achieve it by directing and acting in the classic Broadway dramatic play called ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". The weekend premiere is coming up and the live previews are underway, but the real drama of Birdman is behind the curtain. The lead actor for the play is injured and his replacement is the brilliant method actor, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton). Mike is a blessing and a curse to Riggan and Brandon Vander Hay (Zach Galifianakis), his lawyer, business partner and friend. Shiner is a master craftsman and his presence helps to boost ticket sales, but he brings the self-absorbed baggage of method acting. Adding to the drama of the production, Riggan wrestles with his theatrical alter-ego, the challenge of his washed up daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), the disdain of an influential critic and the minutia of managing this disastrous stage production. As with many great theatrical events, the behind the stage antics of the players and stage crew lead to disaster after disaster. Riggan's life and the production are a mess, but he has to do all that he can to salvage both through this play. <br/><br/>Seeing Birdman causes a love/hate cinematic response. Alejandro González Iñárritu (Babel, 21 Grams) does an masterful work of storytelling. His style has the European flare and brilliance that is not to often experienced in American cinema. Shooting the film as one long take was risky, but added to the tension of the production. He was able to draw from the energy of the theatre and the desperation of the actors. The visual experience was accentuated by the tension of the actors having to deliver their lines and hit their marks. This level of intensity that cannot be manufactured in this era of over-production and excessive editing. Keaton and Norton were at their acting best. Even though they do not admit to an autobiographical nature of the story, their ability to draw from their real life career experiences adds a depth to their performances. Galifianakis gave the performance of his career and represented the glue that holds the story together. His performance added the needed humour and balance to the combustible lead characters. Naomi Watts and Emma Stone held their own in the tension filled, claustrophobic atmosphere of the small theatre. The styling and acting brought forth an engrossing balance of the tragedy and the comedy of live theatre. <br/><br/>The styling and story were brilliant, but they also were the reason for the disdain for this film. Iñárritu reaches into the darkest recesses of the human experience and exposes all of the good and bad in humanity. Whenever a director exposes the unenviable existence of actors and what they do to achieve greatness in their field, it sucks the joy out of the cinematic experience. It equates to watching sausage being made, the process makes the product less appealing. Looking deep into the lives of the actors shows the audience that all of humankind wrestles with the same issues of envy and the need for love and acceptance. Also, this film shows the emptiness that can occur when one achieves them. Not that reality is bad, but this film crosses into uncomfortable depths. Every turn of the camera gives the feeling of travelling through Riggan's thoughts. Each corner brings to light something that adds a less than desirable experience. Just when you think that the story could not get any worse, it does. The film contains a brilliance and freshness in cinema, but draws out a despair that should remain in the shadows. If you enjoy being faced with the harsh realities of the world, Birdman is the film for you, but it will not appeal to those seeking an enjoyable cinematic escape. The challenge in seeing this film was to consider where identity, hope and love can truly be found. It is the only means of pulling yourself out of the depression that will engulf your life after seeing this film. <br/><br/>Leaving the cinema... Birdman is a true art house experience. The artistry cannot be denied, but the message is hopeless. The direction and acting pushed the performers to new heights in their careers, but the story will push the audience into undesired depths.<br/><br/>Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Where do we find our identity? (Genesis 1:27, 2 Corinthians 5:17) 2. How far should we go to achieve our goals? (Proverbs 21:5, Philippians 3:14) 3. Where can you find hope in this despairing world? (Deuteronomy 31:6, Romans 12:12) <br/><br/>Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Art House Russelling Review<br/><br/>*A film intended to be a serious artistic work, often experimental and not designed for mass appeal. These reviews will be focused on the artistic side of the the cinematic experience. The majority of these films will be for mature audiences."
"cloud_nine","7","1","8","15 November 2014"," A Difficult Movie to Figure Out
","On the positive side, the acting is superb. Michael Keaton was never better and Ed Norton also gave a brilliant performance. Oddly, Norton's role ended about 20 minutes before the end of the movie. The difficult part for me was determining what was real and what was in Keaton's demented brain.<br/><br/>At least twice before the movie ended, I thought that it was ending: first when Keaton jumped off the building and secondly when he shot himself on stage. But he just kept on going like the Energizer bunny. The ending was ambiguous. He jumped out of the hospital window. He had just shot himself in front of 800 people. Why was he left alone? His daughter comes in and looks down from the window. Not seeing him, she looks up and smiles. Fade to black. So Keaton is really Birdman? I doubt it. Maybe they were stuck for an ending."

"AgnesSomosi","9","1","9","23 February 2015"," Your inner soul
","The film is described mostly as a satire, but it is more of a psychotic drama for me. As we see the thoughts of Birdman get real around him, it makes it more tragic. You might be also wondering if you are seeing a debate inside the head of an insane man, which makes it realistic and dramatic at the same time. What fascinated me probably the most, was the work of the photographer, a genius! Loved the pictures fading in and out from one scene into the other, seemed like there were no editing at all, perfect compositions. Also, the drumming matched perfectly the tense atmosphere. After seeing the movie, I realised when talking to others that it is a contradicting one. The different layers in the story, of the play they are rehearsing, are not in sequence, because it is simply not important. I think those who don't understand the movie, get lost in these details, cannot follow the outsider's perspective, which is emphasised by Inarritu, he makes us see every scene from behind, so I think viewers should be more of observers. I would like to congratulate Inarritu, Lubezki to create this original piece, and Michael Keaton to make it real. I also loved Emma Stone's performance. Cannot wait to see the movie again and again:) I only give 10 if it is getting better for the second and third time, I guess it will be 10 soon!"

","It's difficult to explain how good the acting in this movie is. The cast easily convinces the audience that the characters are deep, multidimensional, and understandable. If you love powerful and emotive acting, see this movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story is a bit weak. That is, as this is more of a character piece than a standard narrative, it may be inaccessible to audiences who want strong story and big visual effects, but aren't super-concerned with the masterful acting.<br/><br/>At just under two hours, I never felt the length of this movie. The elaborate dialogue and realistic character portrayals -at least for me- enthralled my mind for the entire performance. <br/><br/>TLDR: You like great acting, see this movie.

","Birdman stars Michael Keaton as a former movie star who is attempting to get back on top of the world by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway play. Along the way we see him as he puts up with his personal demons as well as everyone else's. Let me tell you that this movie is a perfect example of the reason why people go to movies. The acting is top notch, the direction is flawless, the script is clever and powerful, the editing is immaculate, the cinematography is stunning, the all drum score is exiting, and it all comes together with a very focused vision. Also, this movie is one of the rare times where the film's style boosts the substance versus distracting from a lack thereof. The movie has a very clever visual style: it was shot to look like one continuous tracking shot, which began with Hitchcock's ""Rope"" and similarly has a reason to do it above ""it looks cool."" At first I though people liked it because it's fun to play ""Spot the Cut,"" or because people like to see independent films because they get to boast they ""saw an indy,"" (ex. Precious) but this movie was absolutely incredible. I haven't a single issue, so Birdman gets a 10/10. This is by far the best film of 2014."
"lasttimeisaw","8","1","9","11 February 2015"," BIRDMAN cannot escape its all-too-obvious self-awareness in spite of its equally overt artisanal conceit
","Finally I can get around to watch several current Oscar contenders before this year's ceremony arriving in mere two weeks. BIRDMAN is the most intriguing one, it might give Alejandro González Iñárritu the prestige which his fellow Mexican compatriot Alfonso Cuarón has received one year earlier for GRAVITY (2013, 9/10), simply because the film is the another formidable labor-of-love with a paradigm-shifting cinematographic endeavor, not a coincidence, the two films share the same DP Emmanuel Lubezki, not even detractors can deny BIRDMAN's spurious one-long-take gimmick is a wonder to witness, sometimes viewers are so much so that being overpowered by the slithering camera movements in the masterly spatial structures and even overlook the proceedings on screen, so, a re-watch is highly recommended. <br/><br/>Basically the movie is a self-referencing parody, the former Batman Keaton plays a washed- up actor Riggan Thomson, whose most popular role is also in a money-grubbing franchise called Birdman as the titular superhero, now 20 years has past since the last time he was in that bird uniform, he is going to Broadway and trying to revive his career by writing, directing and staring a play adapted of Raymond Carver's WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LOVE, finally this is a career-defining opportunity for Keaton and he nails it remarkably. Naomi Watts is Lesley, one of the actress of the play, it is her Broadway debut, she is so insecure of her acting capability, and also shares a girl-on-girl kiss with another actress Laura (Riseborough), sounds familiar, a tribute to MULHOLLAND Dr. (2001, 9/10), right? Also there is Edward Norton plays Mike Shiner, a vainglorious actor who comes on board in the last minute but turns out to be quite a prick both on and off stage, so Iñárritu must be fully aware of Norton's reputation before offering him such a meaty part which would be a comeback call for the once prodigal son (his play-off with Keaton is terrific!). One cannot left out Emma Stone, who plays Sam, Riggan's rehab-retreated daughter, with her druggy make-up and ever-so-popping eyes, an ex-junkie is so full of life. Her flaring-up tirade against Riggan's last-straw investment on this play is her ticket to an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Antonio Sanchez's syncopated drum beats amps up the narrative wonderfully, in particular when Riggan battles with his undying alter-ego, the Birdman, his own demon which urges him to fight, to still be relevant in the downfall, through his illusory telekinesis, the imagined flying, and a real Time Square streaking, until the surprising curtain call in the premiere of the play, Riggan succeeds, which in an ironical way leaves him a bird-man mask on the face, he is on the top page of the newspaper again, until the inexplicable ending, the film tries very hard to maintain its strength as a dark comedy (against its unique faux-one-take guideline), yet Sam's expression in the coda certainly is a perfect solution to render this tall- tale with a phantasmagoric explanation. <br/><br/>The race between BOYHOOD (2014, 8/10) and BIRDMAN has reached its acme thanks to the divisive outcome from SAG, PGA, DGA (all favor BIRDMAN) and BAFTA (BOYHOOD captures the top honor), although neither of them are in my top 3, I will give an edge to BOYHOOD. BIRDMAN owns its undiminished flair with its distinguished style, but personally, like the theater critic in the film (who is marvelously played by Lindsay Duncan in her cameo appearance), none of the characters are sympathetic enough to deserve our care and attention, a has-been cannot cope with the fact that he is past his prime, and needs a miracle to feel alive; an arrogant actor who can only liberate himself on stage whereas off stage, he is a giant pain in the neck; a spoiled daughter wandering in her post- rehab anxiety, these are awful personae who should not have the privilege to win audience over, of course, maybe in the eyes of academy members, they are way too relevant, too visceral, too reverberating but for the general mass, BIRDMAN cannot escape its all-too- obvious self-awareness in spite of its equally overt artisanal conceit, and for Iñárritu, one can assume that he knows showbiz is a stinking vat, but he cannot fully resist its alluring temptation, instead, he gives its a leeway and fawn on for its highest recognition. My sole hope is that the majority of the academy members' eyes are limpid enough to discern that."

The story had several plot holes specially at the end when you cannot really know if he died or not, did he kill himself at the beach and this is just his imagination or everything truly happened, but these plot holes define the movie, they want you to think or use your imagination to imagine the perfect way possible to end the movie. it deserves 10 out of 10 and the 9 Oscar nominations!

"Incendid","10","1","9","7 February 2015"," A meticulously crafted story with stellar performances.
","Birdman is a dark comedy about Riggan Thompson, a washed up actor who puts on a play, throughout the film he battles his ego and attempts to recover his family all before the opening of the play. With a methodical story, Birdman becomes a film that is easy to follow and still talks about serious themes, such as drug addiction, control, adultery, relevance, film critics, friendship, lying, celebrities and of course superheroes. All these themes are woven flawlessly into the script that is delivered perfectly thanks to the great direction of Alejandro G. Inarritu and stellar performances from Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts. Keaton was the only person who could play Riggan Thompson, the chemistry between Keaton and Stone was great, the constant banter between pretty much everyone in the cast was a great touch and the weight of the film was so effectively executed in the dialogue. Alejandro Inarritu's directing was meticulous and precise, but the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki was fantastic, the idea for the film to look like one take was an intelligent idea and it allowed the film to feel like a play, which was a nice touch and was an effective technique. <br/><br/>Birdman talks about the negative effects of drugs, yet taking drugs is accepted by and sometimes even encouraged by society. The film dives into the role of the director and how their ego can sometimes come in the way of the production, sometimes causing damage to their work, it also talks about clashing egos between cast and crew, the manipulative ways of the director and the struggle for absolute control on what should be a collaborative project. The film comments on relevance through Riggan's ever changing struggle to become relevant once more. But Riggan isn't the only one who struggles with being relevant, we see the supporting cast also struggle as they too wish to be relevant. The film touches on film critics and makes the statement of how most film critics just give labels to everything and don't talk about story or structure, but rather they focus on grudges or jealousies they may hold for performers in the production. The film touches on celebrities and how they take a lot more credit for their work than they should, it also comments on how people instantly forget about one celebrity after x amount of years and move onto the new celebrity who is doing the exact same thing as the last celebrity.<br/><br/>In summary Birdman is a excellent film that has been beautifully shot, crafted and performed into a masterpiece. Birdman is the best film of 2014 for me and it is definitely worth watching. 10/10."

","first of all great acting, AMAZING directing and cinematography. it is one of those movies where you don't care what the movie is about, you just want to enjoy the camera movement. however, the writing was also great. this movie is deep sh*t kinda movie, and once in a while I like watching such one. it is all ""read between the lines"" scenes, and here is my own interpretation of it. <br/><br/>the movie appears to be one long shot except of the last 10 minutes (for a reason I'll explain later) and this one shot is the life of Riggan from his point of view. it was edited in such a way to make us engage in his life and step into his shoes to understand him more. Riggan is a man of low self worth and confuses happiness with admiration, and so he always seek people's admiration and approval. he left Hollywood and his multimillion franchise film to create and star in a play which he does not like to be in just to make people believe in his talent. this shows when Birdman talks to him all the time and he imagine himself flying and having superpowers as what he really loved was Birdman and being famous but he left all that to the the ""artist"" that people respect. <br/><br/>the superpower is his secret wish. he wants this very much because he is very vulnerable and peoples opinions get into him easily. he just wishes to control the world and destroy all haters. the superpower wishes are getting worse in his mind to the point where he started to get delusional. this shows in many scenes. one scene is where he saw the light dangling but did nothing about it so it hit that actor he hated. later on he was convinced that he did that using his superpower, where what really happened is that he just saw it moving then falling and just thought he did that. <br/><br/>at the end, Riggan shot himself in the stage and there where he really died. this is evidence by the shot of the jellyfish (where he told his ex wife he tried to kill himself before and jellyfish attacked him). here where he got all what he ever wanted, a standing ovation, the critics walks away and he finally becomes famous. he took a real gun based on Mike's suggestion as he will do anything to please people and get approval. also after that scene the movie cuts and start to have different style of cinematography and lighting and this means that the scenes after he shot himself are not part of his life as he is already dead. in the hospital he had patches like Birdman and when he removed them he looked like him. this means that he finally became what he always wanted to be after he died, famous. and when he threw himself out of the window it was just a metaphor of being finally free. and his daughter smiling when she saw him symbolizes that she finally saw him for what he really is and forgave him and finally had her peace."
"akash_sebastian","9","1","9","5 February 2015"," A Mesmerizing Experience Not To Be Missed by Ardent Movie Lovers
","While innovative director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has given us many brilliant films before, this is the first time he's delved into the genre of comedy, that too black comedy. His ambitious attempt to make the movie appear to be shot in one seamless motion for most of it (with the help of numerous retakes and proper edits) certainly works to the movie's advantage; it makes us a part of the lead protagonist's (Thomas Riggan's) inescapable reality, much like life. But more importantly, it takes us into the mind of the director himself.<br/><br/>In a bird's eye view, the film may appear to be a critique on the ever-growing trend of superhero movies, and the politics of show business in general. But essentially, it's a satire on human traits like ego and ambition, our constant search and struggle to feel relevant and important in this world; many of us forsake everything else in order to achieve this. We can see this through Riggan's character, who is conflicted between the once-achieved stardom through his Birdman movies and his present, where he is adapting the work of an author (Carver) because of whom he became an actor in the first place. Birdman vs Carver - On one side, we have Birdman, which gained him the love and affection of audiences worldwide, and on the other side, we have Raymond Carver, which represents the kind of intellectual work which usually gets critical acclaim. So, he is stuck between the two, internally struggling to decide which one to choose; he ambitiously wants the love of both audiences and critics alike.<br/><br/>Other than being a black comedy, the movie also falls into the genre of Magical Realism (movies like 'Pan's Labyrinth', 'Life of Pi', 'Midnight in Paris'). Riggan keeps hearing this voice speaking to him, and can perform telekinesis and levitation whenever he wants. This Birdman is just the personification of his inner ego and the larger-than-life image he once had; Riggan wants to soar through the sky. And ego's personification here (Birdman) draws parallels to Icarus (who flew too close to the sun with wings made of feathers and wax).<br/><br/>Other than the amazing screenplay, the dialogues are the film's biggest strength; they are sharp-witted and hilarious, and form the backbone of the film. After that, it's brilliant performances given by Michael Keaton and Edward Norton; they are pure delight to watch. Zach Galifianakis also does a good job, and the four ladies (Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan) look and perform terrific. Emmanuel Lubezki's camera-work and Antonio Sanchez's drum score certainly help the movie feel like it does. Without Lubezki's assistance, the apparent single shot feat couldn't have been achieved; the movie looks spectacular.<br/><br/>It's interesting to notice how many of the actors have association with superhero movies; Keaton was Tim Burton's Batman (this is what makes his character self-referential), Norton was the Incredible Hulk, and Stone was Gwen Stacy in the contemporary Spiderman series. On top of that, we see that Riggan's character has many similarities with the character Ed he's playing in the stage play within the movie. And the few aspects of Ed's life which aren't there in Riggan's life become fulfilled towards the second half of the movie. All these parallels help in blurring the lines between fiction and reality, which makes the movies quite psychotic, and at the same time, fascinating.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie tackles with so many captivating themes that a simple review like mine is not enough to discuss all of them. All I can say is, for people who get what the director is going for, the movie is sure to stay etched in their minds for a long time, and forms an important topic for many round-table discussions. 'Birdman' is a mesmerizing experience not to be missed by ardent movie lovers.<br/><br/>-------------------------SPOILERS-------------------------<br/><br/>People who might be left confused by ending - We see Riggan get up from his bed and getting onto the window. Then, we see his daughter Sam coming into the room, looking outside the window. She looks up and smiles. The movie ends there.<br/><br/>My interpretation is: No, Riggan didn't jump off the window and try to kill himself again. We don't see him jumping, we just see him standing there. Maybe he was just enjoying the view of the city (world) with his new-found perspective. He's done with the inner struggle, his mind is at peace now, and his act got him the feeling of relevance he craved for, so there's no need to kill himself. When Sam looks out the window, she looks up and smiles; this is when Riggan's metaphoric fantasy meets Sam's physical reality. Sam sees him flying and soaring through the sky. All this time, Riggan was the only one who was in these delusions of fantasy. He had the larger-that-life image 20 years ago, when he was popular with his Birdman movies. Sam was too young at that time. Now with the new-found fame and acclaim all around, Sam finally sees him the way he has always seen himself - as the majestic hero soaring above everyone."

","As a fan of Michael Keaton almost my entire life, I do have to say this film did not let me down due to him. He has always been a great character actor, and Birdman proves that he's still got that. Overall, I enjoyed the film; Galifinakis was the perfect neurotic director, Norton was an impeccable asshole, the jarring, unconventional musical score and shaky camera perfectly mirrored the scattered chaotic personal and professional lives of the characters.<br/><br/>Where I felt some disappointment was the woeful neglect of Riggan's Birdman psyche. I would have loved to see some backstory on how this character became so schizophrenically entrenched in the mind of Riggan. The audience could have used the break; after about an hour of endless theatre scenes, I was becoming a bit restless and thinking it would be nice if the plot took a detour. More exploration into Birdman would have also given a chance to showcase the much-hyped, incredible suit designed by the unmatched Spectral Motion. I think the full suit was seen on screen a total of twice during the course of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Birdman was a moderately funny, clever and avant-garde film that could have been even an outstanding one with even a little more exploration into the mysterious costumed hero of Riggan's past"
"stevendbeard","6","1","9","15 November 2014"," Interestingly Weird
","I saw ""Birdman:or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"", starring Michael Keaton-Robocop_2014, Batman_1989; Edward Norton-The Incredible Hulk_2008, Fight Club; Emma Stone-The Amazing Spider-Man_2012, The House Bunny and Zach Galifianakis-The Hangover movies, Tru Calling_tv.<br/><br/>This is an interestingly weird movie. It's directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu-Biutiful, Babel, 21 Grams. From what I had heard about the film, it sounded interesting, but by the time it was over, I just did not get it. Michael plays an actor that was big back in the 1990's for playing a super hero called Birdman. He made three Birdman movies and was offered a forth but decided that he had had enough of the character and said no-sounds close to what really happened with Michael and the Batman series. Now, he wants to direct and star in a Broadway play to show everyone that he is a real actor and can do serious material. The weird part comes in when Michael starts hallucinating-at least, that is what I understood it to be-conversations with his Birdman character. Michael also displays telekinetic powers-or is he just hallucinating?-like moving objects, just by looking at them and turning things on and off, with a wave of his hand. Emma plays Michael's daughter, who has recently gotten out of drug rehab and is now helping her father as an assistant or gofer. Zach plays Michael's manager and Edward is another actor in the play. One of the interesting tidbits is that most of the movie looks like it was shot in one take. There are a couple of places where you can tell there are cuts but for the most part, it looks like just one long take. It's rated ""R"" for language, sexual content-partial nudity-and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD but it is interesting enough to be a rental."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","10","4 February 2015"," A Technical Marvel That's Ambitious, Audacious & Astonishing.
","From the director of Amores Perros, 21 Grams & Babel, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu's most distinct & daring film to date when compared to his previous works, and certainly the most ambitious one around on a technical scale as the renowned filmmaker here aims to blur the lines between theater & film as well as reality & fiction without breaking continuity and for the most part, he truly succeeds.<br/><br/>Birdman tells the story of a former Hollywood star famous for playing an iconic superhero decades ago & who is now a washed up actor. Filled with regret, constantly tormented by the voice of his most memorable character & fearing of falling into oblivion, he decides to make a comeback by risking everything he has on a Broadway play, hoping that its success will revitalize his career. But as the play approaches its premiere, he runs into several issues.<br/><br/>Co-written, produced & directed by Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu, Birdman is a huge leap for the Mexican filmmaker as he completely reinvents his tone, style & method without discarding the themes that have been an integral part of his entire filmography. Screenplay takes a jab at all things Hollywood & doesn't even spare the critics but it is actually in the fluid execution of these moments where Birdman ends up making its biggest impression.<br/><br/>Emmanuel Lubezki is steadily rising as one of the best camera operators around & with Birdman, he adds another impressive feat to his résumé. Apart from its opening & closing moments, the entire picture is presented as one continuous long take for the camera keeps floating from one character to another, even manages to shift through time & different sets without breaking continuity, and works in perfect tandem with editing & digital effects to pull off its gimmick.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Michael Keaton makes a stunning return to form with a work that's arguably his career-best. But he isn't alone as Edward Norton also chips in a performance we haven't seen from the actor in a long time. And the supporting cast is no slouch either for Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zack Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan & Lindsay Duncan do a fine job in their given roles, but Birdman is ultimately Keaton's show all the way from start to finish.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Iñárritu's first foray into the comedy genre has more positives than negatives for his latest is a technical marvel that's ambitious, audacious & astonishing, and yet I can't help but feel slightly underwhelmed by it because it could've done so much more with its self- referential characters, the theater vs film & art vs commerce argument, and its bashing of critics but it unfortunately doesn't. In the end, the most memorable thing about this film isn't its story or characters but its one-shot gimmick. Nevertheless, Birdman comes recommended."

","what amazing film this is. This weird yet amazing film had great writing and brilliant acting. Often funny and dramatic at times and very amazing cinematography, also very well edited.

Emma stone was also very great in the time she had in the film. As usual Edward Norton delivers a great performance. I loved the long shots which added to the uniqueness to this film.

","Meanwhile. This film shows us what we are doing with together, right now. Starting from the final person who is hit and ends with the only one, guilty in creating that affecting phenomenon. A film that captures the viewer from the beginning and does not release him until the end. You could say that is an action (there were dynamics and shooting guns) or fantasy (superheroes and special effects) movie; it can be described as far more courageous approach of Linklater's (Waking Life) movies and similar to Synecdoche, New York - whatever definition you give it, it will diminish, because it really manages to fly over all definitions.<br/><br/>Shows the intertwining of life and work, shifts from the first to the second and vice versa. Acquaints us with stage fright before major events in our lives and looking for a place of privacy in the modern, public, virtual life. Shows what is doing and what is sitting on the sidelines and watch. Passes through the development of individuals and traces the stages in which they are located.<br/><br/>Understanding of criticism (poor vilified by Flaubert), which can be justified with saying that criticism is philosophically demarcation of what is criticized, but, we agree, it happens in ready structures and cold concepts. But it remains below, in the low, irrelevant for the outspread wings high above it.<br/><br/>A must see movie.<br/><br/>http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/"

","The best directing I, semi-movielover, have seen over years. Emotions are up, so to be more conservative, in 2014. Excellent directing in creating a schizophrenic, witty story about fear(s) and the power they have to influence someones exteroception. I rediscovered Michael Keaton (as I said, semi-movielover), got even more convinced in Ed Norton and I just love Emma Stone. I don't care if there was some Hollywood vs theatre or ignorant action vs deep and meaningful as long as I find it done with passion and fun. Viewer sees stress and the many ways of how it can manifest. In ""Birdman"" a possible actors/actresses stress and the menacing hollow feeling that comes from fear. Well balanced with that feeling what every actors/actresses, whoever's ego longs for: approval and immortality. I'm Birdman!"
"charlieamargolis","9","0","2","20 May 2020"," A different style superhero film.
","Birdman is a film about a washed up superhero actor transitioning to Broadway. The film was designed to look like one entire shot this can be said to symbolise Michael Keaton's (Birdman) continuous and ongoing internal conflict, this interests me as it gave me a new perspective to think about when discussing about a film. Furthermore, when the following/reframing shots sped up the soundtrack also did, sort of intertwining them both, this the gave Michael Keaton's character more emotion and frustration between him and his inner self because the fast soundtrack and following/reframing shots embodies his heartbeat and his impulsivity. This is another ingenious point of view, which heavily increased my enjoyment of this compelling film. Finally, the use of the steadicam shot was crucial as it almost felt like it was giving the audience a break from conflict and tension when they where using the fast paced pan shots."

","The story of fading actor Riggan Thompson (Michael Keaton)- who was once famous for his iconic role as the Birdman, takes on the straining task to mount a Broadway play.
As we see him struggle his way to the opening night, the journey of a movie star to truly become an actor while battling his ego and mending relationships becomes pellucid.<br/><br/>The first thing that comes in my mind when I talk of this movie is its phenomenal piece of cinematography - a continuous shot feature.
Iñárritu makes sure that the characters make you question the moral, ethical and existential backdrop in which you live, all the while never taking away the glimmer of hope.
There is a constant feeling for validation and relevance and it cynically connects to the audience.<br/><br/>With spectacular ensemble of cast and remarkable storytelling, this is definitely a noteworthy watch for everyone out there.<br/><br/>The film truly resonates with (Edward Norton) Mike's dialogue:
""If art isn't making you feel something real, something uncomfortable, it's not inspiring.""
-
My Unpopular Opinion:
In its year, Birdman took home all the awards and I have seen people go gaga over it. However, there has been this uncanny thing that I could never point a finger on regarding why I could never ""love"" the movie until recently I read this review by Todd VanDerWerff.<br/><br/>VanDerWerff talks about how the script being filled with exposition and I finally sighed, understanding that the characters have actually been explaining to each other their mental states rather than exploring them throughout the movie!<br/><br/>And on a closer inspection, other than Sam's (Emma Stone) monologue about Riggan being self obsessed, none of the dialogues hold a substantial core."

Film revolves around Riggan Thomson, a fading cinema superhero, plans to resurrect his career with a passionate Broadway production, his ignorance and stubbornness' to accept reality makes him an annoying disturbed old guy. Michael Keaton as Riggon is surely the perfect fit for the character and he nailed it totally along with some watchful support by the seasoned cast including Edward Norton. Cinematography and Direction is something to look for in this masterpiece, once you'll start with this movie you'll probably get the feeling that film has been picturized in a single extended shot which shows the sheer brilliance of Emmanuel Lubezki & Alejandro.

So I had to see why was this movie better than Interstellar that wasn't even nominated and guess what? It wasn't. I'm not trying to make this review about Interstellar but the Academy really got everything wrong that year, even American Sniper was nominated but Interstellar was not, like really? Although all of this I will no try to compare them and give my honest opinion about the movie.<br/><br/>In terms of direction I must say that this was the best one shot movie I've ever seen with smart and beautiful transitions from one scene to another. The photography was also pretty good and overall this has some pretty good cinematography, is not one of those one shot movies that you get bored by the way it his made and for the fact that the camera is always following up, to be honest I even forgot it was one shot at some point. This movie has also a top-notch acting and perhaps some of the greatest acting of the last decade but of course I have to highlight Edward Norton and Michael Keaton!<br/><br/>About the plot itself this is not one of the most brilliant and complex stories that you will see but it's pretty decent. The main character has an alter ego that speaks with him which adds something interesting in the story. The movie is all about broadway and everything about actors and theater and watching this movie really feels like watching a theater and they deserve recognition for that. This contains some interesting dialogues and ideas and I loved the scene when the critics were criticized and the dialogue in it. It also talks about trending nowadays and popularity and in a certain way criticize and satirize it. This also won Best Soundtrack and once again I think that the Academy got it wrong because the Soundtrack is pretty good but ain't even near of Interstellar's, sorry I know I said that I would not compare them but in this certain aspect I really have to.<br/><br/>I don't want to give spoilers about the last movie events but the final scene was interesting and I really liked that!

","""Birdman"" is directed by Alejandro G Iñarritu and stars Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone. This film is about an actor trying to find his place back in the world again, becoming relevant in today's age, with his new play on Broadway.<br/><br/>This film is about a wide range of subjects and themes, as the main character, Riggan Thompson (Keaton) goes through in his life. He was once a praised actor, playing the role of ""Birdman"" in a comic book superhero film. He is now known for that role, despite probably portraying many other characters in films. He has an estranged relationship with his daughter, Sam (Stone), that he is trying to reshape. Sam is just out of rehab and dealing with her own issues. Mike (Norton) is an actor Riggan hires after his other actor gets injured on set. Mike is very good at his job, but a difficult man to work with.<br/><br/>Keaton is terrific as Riggan. The character resembles the actor in a way. Michael Keaton is known for his famous portrayals as Batman and Beetlejuice, despite playing many other characters in other films. Riggan is the same way, only being known for Birdman, and the way he protrayls Riggan is great.<br/><br/>Norton is equally great as Mike. He is literally playing himself in this character. Edward Norton is infamous for being a difficult actor to work with, which he acknowledges in his own way.<br/><br/>The cinematography is ambitious but amazing. Only 16 visible cuts through this film that seems like it is one shot. Therefore the direction, production design and acting all holds up with, and is amazing to see these long scenes unfold.<br/><br/>The film has a great drum-only slick, jazzy soundtrack, that fits uniquely with the film. It's raw and dry, like how the film plays out.<br/><br/>Th film ends with a powerful punch to the audiences. Riggan takes a real gun and purposefully shoots himself on stage during the play, trying to kill himself. Shooting his nose off, he wakes up in a hospital being taken care of, and getting great reviews from critics of his play. As Riggan hit the stage floor after firing the gun, audiences clapped at how real the scene looked. One woman even walked out. This symbolises how critics love the realism of the stage no matter how real it is. Audiences had the right to think the gun was fake, and whilst it wasn't fake, audiences bought the realism of the play. In the hospital, you can tell Riggan regrets his actions. He got the fame and the great reviews of his play, but at what cost.<br/><br/>Birdman is a film about many subjects and themes, with an ambiguous ending that leaves the audience wondering what it all meant. A worthy watch.<br/><br/>Overall: 8.4/10"

","There is one line in this movie which describes the broadway play which lies at the center of this absurdly beautiful movie as ""hyperrealistic"" & I think that perfectly explains ""Birdman"" in one word. You can actually feel the emotions the main character is going through because whilst they may be surreal in some cases they never fail to be relateable. Judging the Riggan as a character is incredibly difficult because you can't help but feel that you'd act in a simmilar way if you were in such situations. The camerawork in this movie is beautifully executed and feels almost dizzying whilst remaining grounded and emersive. There is not one route this movie takes that feels out of place or rushed which makes the viewing experience so captivating. Inurratu manages to tell a story that resonates with the viewer on such a deep human level whilst never feeling pretentious or distance.

(almost all of it is shot in a building so we can't look for the sky, and almost no clocks shown explicitly.) it's kinda detailed, shows what is going on behind the scenes, so with no cuts, it emphasizes that there is nothing that's not important here.

","Now we have a satire, yes people this movie is a satire, and a great one. So this movie plot in a ambiguous way is that there's an actor that once was movie star for playing a superhero and the years passed and now he is forgotten by everyone and he's only remember by the guy who once was birdman.<br/><br/>So if you pay attention to this, if we take out the word birdman and instead with put Batman, we might have the same plot for a movie or documentary for obvios reason ( Michael Keaton ). So this satire takes irony to another level almost making a documentary for Michael Keaton but I think this movie has brought to the spotlight again, and he was lucky to be on hands of Alejando iÃ±arritu and wonderful cast with Emma stone, Naomi Watts, Edward Norton ti name a few. For my taste this movie is was one of the best films of 2014, winning the Oscar for best film in 2015 for a good reason, because also we had an excellent continuity of the movie, so the movie looks that it has a continuity that never stops.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, a great black comedy with great performances and beautiful shot that it a must watch for movie fans and people that appreciate art."

","A dark comedy, a tale of love not to be, an exploration of cinema and theatre, a deconstruction of superheroes and their films and a modern masterpiece of technological filmmaking.<br/><br/>Birdman has been my favourite film ever since I first watched it in 2014, and it hasn't faltered in any way since then.<br/><br/>This is a film that so elegantly dissects theme and intent from the superhero genre, theatre productions, Raymond Carver and his work, modern art and the reason why we struggle and how we strive past it. This is a film that breaks the confines of the screen and shows you what you've been thinking about for a long time.<br/><br/>This is a film that confronts the nature of us and reflects something unsettling and ugly, but still believes in hope, love and colour in life. There is a potency to the thematics at play in the film, a true journey of exploration across so much more than criticising superheroes. The film uses this lens to draw you in, a promise of deconstruction, a promise of catharsis, and what is then given to you is something else, something much more profound and meaningful.<br/><br/>In terms of ecological storytelling, the film utilises its runtime down to a mathematic precision, sifting through ever scene to get the most out of the characters, actors, metaphors and aesthetic. A blindingly triumphant function is at the heart of the film, where so many other films miss their target with connection and intent through poor overall function, Birdman soars above, revealing a collection of images and sounds that stick with you for years, and of which have stayed culturally, subtextually, filmicly and politically relevant. This is a film that understands that it needs to exist, it needs to be talked about, it needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>There is a simple joy to decoding the subtext and metaphor of the film; finding what it means to you and then finding what it means for others. Although surface level, that simple joy is encouraged by the film, by essentially packing every frame with as much relevant meaning and philosophy as it can. This might seem heavy handed to some, but to me, and I think to art, it is working at a level far beyond what you could refer to as 'pretentious,' or 'basic.' To me, this film transcends this kind of bad faith idealism, instead opting to help you experience the rawness of film, the elevated nature of theme and how it can be applied to any time.<br/><br/>Birdman is a film that haunts me, I see it everywhere, it manifests in people, places, art and nature. There is something so very finite about the film, something so very true and real to us. I see it as an absolute achievement of art and the work of human nature, and the best thing about that is that the film already comments on that and suggests how and where we should evolve with next."

","I'm not going to lie, I pay money to see Michael Keaton's Birdman. Birdman stars Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, and Edward Norton and is directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu and tells the story of how Michael Keaton was a very successful actor because he was Birdman and now he's just a wash up has-been actor looking for a comeback. Michael Keaton is a fantastic actor and he's very controlling of his play and he slowly starts to lose his sanity that you kind of feel bad for him, but at the same time he's just arrogant. Its kind of hard to describe this movie because the way Alejandro directs this movie is in one shot. There's no edits between two characters like in movies that you watch in the theatre so that was an interesting take on his work, which I've never seen before and it shows that he is a fantastic director. Besides Michael Keaton I think the best performance is Edward Norton. He plays this method actor who is a jerk just like Michael Keaton is and you hate him even more, but between the two you have to admit deep down that Edward Norton does make interesting points. As for the brief romance between Edward Norton and Emma Stone, I did feel like that was just added randomly because this movie apparently needs a love romance. And there were a couple of scenes here and there that also felt random and peculiar, but I loved it as I asking myself are we seeing this in Michael Keaton's mind or is the play just an illusion. Overall I thought it was a fantastic movie with some great performances and it is definitely worth your time."

In this film, he wants to succeed on Broadway in a play. Emma Stone played his daughter, Sam. Edward Thornton played his co-star in the play. Zach Galifankis played a producing partner in the production. Filmed on location in New York City, the film is about temperamental actors and the process being one. The film is somewhat entertaining except I can't stand the bird costume. Michael Keaton does a tour-de-force performance as Riggan, an unusual name. The film won an Academy Award for Best Picture.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","0","1","24 April 2018"," Filmed as an apparent 'one-take' for tenuous reasons, this art-flick is well-made and entertaining.
","'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance) (2014)' is filmed under the guise of being a single unbroken take for tenuous reasons that, while somewhat valid and certainly appropriately 'arty', are actually rather weak and generally irrelevant when it becomes clear that the conceit was one that the filmmakers wanted to experiment with regardless of the source story, whether it be to solidify its art-house status or to experiment with the technical boundaries of its cast and crew, even when that story clearly strains what is reasonable with this form of story-telling. The first time the flick fast-forwards time while maintaining its fluid style is incredibly jarring, for example, and the second downright breaks the immersion, and arguably intent, of the piece altogether. It is successful in its attempt to appear relatively seamless, though it is digitally enhanced and a few fairly obvious yet slightly hidden cuts do occur, and the one-take mentality almost blends into the back of our minds on more than one occasion. Despite all this talk of technicalities, it is actually the powerful (though clearly 'oscar-baiting') performances and well-written screenplay that makes this satirical piece an enjoyable and entertaining experiment that takes its Hollywood commentary just seriously enough for it to seem genuine, yet not so seriously so that it seems overwhelmingly pretentious. I won't deny that since it looks, feels, plays and generally just seems like it wants to be a play, then perhaps it should've simply been one, though it does use the past career of its protagonist with his new stage-bound setting as an allegory for the overall Hollywood system and it's easy to make the argument that this is perhaps best explored through the medium that it produces. However, no matter how 'arty' it is trying to be seemingly for the sake of being so, it is certainly well-made and entertaining, at least on a first watch. It doesn't quite soar, but it glides from time to time. 8/10"

"milesy-83342","8","0","1","27 February 2018"," I actually like it
","If I have ever spoken to someone about Birdman I have only ever received slating comments back. I often hear the argument which is that ""it is so arrogant"". I do not understand how though. Just because the subject of the film is related to film making and acting itself does not mean the film is arrogant. You do not call Picasso selfish for doing self portraits nor do you call an author rude for writing about them self. Film covers a huge scale, essentially if you can see it you can film it, so is it not expected that one day we would get a film about actors.
 Is it arrogant for a film maker to portray the struggles of an actor? I say no, it is what it is and there is no problem with that. Riggan's struggle to set up his own idea of who he wants to be as an actor could be related to all of us, could it not? From setting up a shop to becoming a painter we will all face struggles when becoming what we want to be so why complain when it is an actor?
I think, without sounding incredibly hippy like, it offers up so much more than a film with the strange feeling of the well set up one shot almost running in parallel with the feeling of watching play. This is also well rounded with the plot of the film - an actor attempting to run a theater production. It gives us some beautiful shots and is executed perfectly perfectly transitioning between ""scenes"" if you can call them that. The upbeat drum track throughout keeps a nicely sped pacing maintained and the erratic nature of the drummer represents the spinning out of control situation theater is in. 
Overall, I really like Birdman and fully disagree with the idea that it is arrogant.With beautiful scenes and enticing characters I will always recommend it"

My problem was that I didn't really know what I was supposed to be feeling - I certainy couldn't imagine spending any time with any of these people (or at least, I couldn't imagine enjoying it).

And he's mean, because nothing matters to him anymore, <br/><br/>Riggan is driven to success, effectively making the film a satire of stardom and the transience of popularity. The very music that plays during the entirety is alive with popping percussion that goes in one and hatches out the other, it becomes a product of the moment, the same goes for the acting. <br/><br/>Keaton's acting and the other actors' and actresses' feels real, it occurs in the second it happens. Making each moment come in for a moment and subsequently disappear forever(or until you watch the thing again).<br/><br/>Riggan's journey is not a happy one, right for a man who gazes only at the past while presiding in the present.

Yes, this film is slow, but the pace builds and all the while we're treated to ambitious camera work and moments of charm from both actors and locations. The long flowing shots don't give you time to rest from whats happening on screen and portrays a frantic sequence of events to show the fast pace and stress of what Keeton's character is going through.<br/><br/>The ending is somewhat vague, another reason why audiences may not enjoy this film, because in todays cinema most people sadly have to be spoon fed and told how to feel, rather than making their own conclusions. If you like your films with more depth than the typical drama or to try and achieve something greater than just confining to what people are used to, watch this.

","The very large majority of the film was bland. The screenplay was great, the dialogue was pretty good and the music perfect for such a film but it was the same thing over and over. A problem, Riggan realizing he's irrelevant, his inner self saying he can be if he tries. That's what I got from it myself at least. That is until the very end *SPOILER ALERT* he pulls out the gun. Most movies build up tension very gradually. Movies like King's Speech and Doubt do it very well. King's Speech does it countless times and bursts the bubble in a very satisfying manner. Doubt does it by building it up very slowly. The scene where Sister Aloysius Beauvier and Father Brendan Flynn are fighting lasts 12 whole minutes. This is where Birdman comes in place. Tension is rarely ever built until one of the last scenes. And not in a gradual and nice way but very suddenly and unexpected. I haven't seen a film that made my heart beat so fast in a long while. The tension was surreal. The way they played it off is a bit ridiculous but not disappointing. Definitely worth a watch."

The long shots blend into each other, when combined with the amazing acting it make it feel like you are watching an actual theater piece. <br/><br/>To me, the movie is about the subjectivity of perception and the price one pays to change that of another. Alejandro addresses the ambiguity that arise as a result of the subjective nature of perception in multiple ways, through the direct narrative where Riggan has to deal with the ambiguity of his own thoughts and desires as well as that stemming from others. Finally, he puts the viewer through the same dilemma. Did Riggan die the first time he jumped off the building? did he blow his nose off and live to see another day? or did he fly away from the hospital like an avenger?

However despite all these dramas the biggest fight is with himself, he has risked everything financially, professionally and personally. Michael Keaton proves his character and ironically himself as an actor are more than relevant with a great performance. The camera work, angles and shots were masterful. I love how the camera moves so loosely with the actors backstage to capture their intensity as it swerves left and right. The passage of time is done well as we effortlessly go from scene to scene. The unusual presence of drums also works well. <br/><br/>The use of Birdman, his alter ego, represents his ambitions and visions of grandeur. Since he achieved great success in the past with Birdman, Birdman is a personification of his dream of success and greatness in his new venture. This is an unprecedented and great use of this alter ego in film and in my opinion the strongest part of the film. In reality we each have a Birdman of our own that represents our dreams of big and great achievement. The presence of superheroes in the film towards the end and the man of steel poster in the background outline the presence of superheroes. This why his Birdman worked so well because it was Michael Keaton's Birdman and with it he was a superhero who could fly. This prompts him to channel and 'listen' to Birdman when he goes all the way using a real gun. Just like the student, worker or sportsman goes out of their way and takes a leap when they are invested in their work so does Michael Keaton's actor in his final scene. <br/><br/>I understand a number of people and their reviews attack Birdman but they may want to watch it again. The issue for most, including me, was people had a traditional mindset of film. They are used to classics that told coherent and structured stories but if you watch it with a different lens and see where it takes you you might change your vote. I adopted a different lens and appreciated it. There is definitely something to see in this film. It is not a piece of rubbish like Moonlight that asks to see something when nothing is there. <br/><br/>To those who are confused with the end it's really not too hard. It was evident when Birdman was channelled in the film because we saw his alter ego Birdman and heard music. The scene where he flies to the theater is a good example because we see a cab driver running after him and can assume he took a cab all along. The same happens in the final scene. Notice that Emma Stone only looks temporarily at the ground before gazing upwards, normally everyone would look below. The purpose was she finally saw her father soar and fly and become a superhero of his own."
"joshbrownwatm","10","0","2","31 March 2017"," The best film of 2014
","Birdman (Or the Unexpected virtue of Ignorance) is the best film I have seen from 2014. Never before have I seen a film present the characters in such a raw, dynamic and fluid way, with performances from Keatan, Stone, and Norton that are nothing short of astounding. I prefer not to use statements like these when I talk about movies but this one manages to impress me enough to deserve it- this is a perfect movie.<br/><br/>To start of the way this film is shot is awe-inspiring in itself. Birdman is presented as if it is all in one shot, no dissimilar to the Carver play that Riggan Thompson (A washed-up middle aged actor who used to play a superhero,) is adapting. While the film clearly isn't actually in one take, like the German heist film Victoria, the transitions between these hyper-coordinated scenes are incredibly well done, to a point where it doesn't even feel like the shot has ended, and the fantastic framing and beautifully fluid nature of these shots is incredibly effective. It gives the film a feel of an amazingly well timed, hyper-coordinated dance between the actors and it's integral to the atmosphere and the progressively tightening tension of the movie.<br/><br/>I mentioned before that the cinematography of this film relates to the play that the main character is adapting and directing, but this is not the only meta theatrical element of the play. Another element of meta theatricality is seen when Riggan and Mike are walking to the bar after a disastrous preview, and we see the movie's score being played by a street performer. This happens again later in the movie as the main character begins to descend into madness and the tone becomes more surrealist, and it's elements like this that show how meticulously choreographed and timed this film is. <br/><br/>It is rare that I can say a movie deserves the academy awards it receives, but if anything this movie deserves even more accolades than it already has, and it's refreshing to see the Oscar for best picture go to a film that truly deserves such a title. To me this is a shining example of a 10/10 movie and if you haven't yet seen it I can't recommend it enough."

","If you've never been in the acting field, you won't relate as well to this film or immensely enjoy it, that much more, in that respect. Has been actor, Riggan (Keaton, in what is obviously his best ever performance) once a action movie star, tries to reinvent himself with this new Broadway play. Riggan is an arrogant, selfish being. Me myself, an actor, has met a few of these people through my experiences. Two things, I related to, especially, was getting locked out once, where I kind of discreetly had to pound the door and church of this church hall to get back in. The other, especially, was the sour female critic character who hated Keaton, where me myself fell out with this leading castng director. This is the stuff that happens. Interfering and becoming a threat to Keaton, is a supporting actor (Norton) called at the last minute, replacing a former actor, who did himself injury. Keaton's daughter (Stone) starts up a relationship, first wowed by his stern, lean physique. He too, is one of these cocky, vain, types and Norton plays it well, although Stone impressed me better. This is the coming of an actress, who is just keeps getting better. The other performance I really liked, despite the strong female performances, from Keaton's wife and lover, was Galifinakis as Keaton's publicist, if I recall. It was just the other performance that stuck out here, while Watts, I really liked as Norton's ex lover. At least her character wasn't a selfish type, and was quite the reverse, and rather cute too. The comforting scene between her and and the other woman in the change room, I've seen many times too. Although I thought the dream sequences with Keaton flying, about the New York cityscape and streets kind of seemed stupid, they were beneficial to the story. As you know too, this movie, is a one camera following shot, and it works beautifully for this story. The end shot is kind an open ended tease, the only real qualm I had with this brilliant film, bolstered by great and intense performances. Strangely the mentioning of the Fawcett/Jackson deaths back in 2009, a day apart, was brought up by Keaton's character."
"Hbarker-32233","6","0","2","19 December 2016"," Ham-fisted, overblown, but also very funny.
","Light as an anvil, Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's Birdman is a sometimes dazzling, often infuriating act of gaseous virtuosity. I was never sure if I should applaud or roll my eyes. A lot of the time I was doing both. The full, run-on title is actually Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), and those pointless punctuation games provide a fitting précis of the movie's laborious playfulness.<br/><br/>Of course, nothing comes lightly to Inarritu. His exhilarating debut Amores Perros gave way to the monotonously miserable grinds of 21 Grams, Babel and Biutiful – artfully photographed wallows in one-note suffering that, in the words of Alvy Singer, ""achieved total heaviosity."" Birdman is Inarritu's idea of a comedy, and I must admit that the early going is indeed very funny. Michael Keaton stars as Riggan Thomson, a fading movie star whose career has fallen on hard times ever since he stopped playing a certain superhero back in the nineties. (Sound familiar? It's supposed to.) Riggan has gambled what's left of his fortune on a crazy hail-mary bid for artistic credibility, starring in and directing a self-penned Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.<br/><br/>Much to the consternation of Riggan's harried producing partner (Zach Galifianakis, playing a different character for once and doing so quite well) the production is a shambles on the eve of previews. There's a pompous Method know-it-all (the sublime Edward Norton) hi-jacking every scene, one actress on the verge of a nervous breakdown (Naomi Watts) and another (Andrea Riseborough) who is sleeping with her director and just might be pregnant. Riggan's also looking after his daughter (Emma Stone), fresh out of rehab and terribly unamused, while his ex-wife (Amy Ryan) keeps dropping by to remind him of all the good things he's thrown away.<br/><br/>Then there's the matter of that pesky super-influential theatre critic (Lindsay Duncan) who sits upon a neighborhood barstool with her notebook, scrawling invective in longhand – which is something I do all the time, so I liked her right away. Unfortunately she's promising to give Hollywood poseur Riggan a career-ending review just on general principle.<br/><br/>For at least the first hour, Birdman is a cheerfully vulgar, door-slamming backstage farce – sorta like an NC-17 Noises Off with everybody talking about the frequently undressed Norton's massive cock. (""Do you really think it looks massive?"" he asks, in all false modesty.) Except these doors never really slam, as the entire film has been intricately choreographed to play out as one single digitally-assisted long take, with rock-star cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's camera gliding in and out of dressing rooms, up and down crowded hallways, into the rafters and onto the roof of Broadway's St. James Theatre.<br/><br/>It's a spectacular stunt, but a stunt nonetheless. On one hand the vertiginous motion conveys Riggan's cluttered headspace, with an all-percussion score thrown-in to deny us even a moment's peace. On the other it is an enormous distraction, with actors arranged in awkward blockings and the audience fighting an irresistible urge to try and spot the seams. Worse, there's no way to cut out of sluggish scenes that have already made their point, so whenever things start dragging you're just stuck there until the camera finally follows Riggan out of the room. (Score one for the unexpected virtue of editing.) Keaton's quicksilver energy is put to fine use here, and Birdman's early, sometimes viciously funny interludes do an expert job of painting Riggan as a vain fraud whose last ditch stab at relevance is really just an out-of-touch ego-trip. (Stone has a lovely monologue putting him in his place.) His play looks kind of awful, expanding Carver's sparse story to include elaborate moonlight soliloquies and even a suicide. Norton runs away with the picture, aping his own storied prima donna antics with such hilarious self-regard that after awhile I laughed just looking at him.<br/><br/>Puzzlingly, in the second half Inarritu abandons the farcical tone and strips away the more interesting supporting characters until Birdman becomes almost a one-man show about a very tiresome mid-life crisis. Indulging in wannabe Fellini fantasy sequences and even having the chutzpah to employ a Shakespeare passage from a certain Scottish play without a hint of irony, the movie suddenly takes quite seriously everything and everyone it had previously been sending up. Like I said, nothing comes lightly to Inarritu. Total heaviosity again.<br/><br/>It all builds to an appreciably ghoulish punchline somewhat botched in the delivery, but by then you're wondering if the movie might not be just as self-absorbed and out of touch as the character it was originally supposed to be kidding.<br/><br/>Besides, a picture savvier about Hollywood and Broadway would have ended with Birdman: Turn Off The Dark."

Anyway, I never knew of anyone who left a cinema complaining, ""Gee, I wish this movie had more swearing."" The Dark Knight trilogy hardly had any swearing, and its box office didn't suffer.<br/><br/>It's a shame Michael ""Batman"" Keaton didn't win an Oscar but maybe his time will come with his role as Ray Kroc in The Founder."

","Yes, this film reeks of pretentiousness. And yes, some of the characters are a little bland, maybe even unnecessary, but that doesn't mean that this is not a great film. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu does have some brilliant, captivating scenes in this thing. One example is when Riggan is running through the streets in his underwear, showing how exposed, vulnerable, and desperate people in show biz are, Inarritu is able to convey the message without any important dialogue. I haven't even mentioned the FANTASTIC acting in this film. I was so surprised that this film did not win any acting Oscars. Michael Keaton, giving easily the best performance of his career, was able to make you believe that he was a washed up actor with nothing to lose, but at the same time, he has everything to lose. Which brings me to the plot. I do not understand why everyone says there is no plot. To me, the plot couldn't be clearer: a washed-up actor produces a play, while his career hangs in the balance. The only thing that is not so great in the plot, is the ending, when Riggan shoots his nose off. There were other, better ways to end it. With that said, this film fantastically shows Hollywood's constant need to be relevant."

","Every once in a while, there comes a movie that really invigorates someone with its performances, story, and direction. Birdman is one of those films that just delivers on all forms to bring a unique experience. While that sounds like over the top praise, I feel like this film will be heralded as a classic as the years fly on by.<br/><br/>Good: I love the story for this film as it encompasses pretty much everything that comes along with being in the entertainment world whether it is Hollywood or Broadway. It talks about the plight former A list actors have with trying to stay relevant, the over saturation of superhero movies and how every major actor seems to be a part of one, the battle between big budget movies against indie films, an actor's need for either credibility or box office draw, and the infiltration of Hollywood into Broadway among many other topics. It balances all of these subjects with grace and it never feels disjointed. Add to that the very meta and excellent performance by Michael Keaton, a hilarious turn from Edward Norton, a career best for Emma Stone, a regulatory one from Zach Galifianakis, and a great supporting cast helps makes the beautiful chaos on screen work. Then there's the direction which is marvelous how the movie seamlessly looks like it was shot in one take.

The scenes kept rolling into each other...in a good way. There was very little flab in this movie, and a whole lot to ponder, not the least of which being: was Riggan truly magical? There were a couple of clues suggesting he wasn't, but the ending suggested that he was. The fat that was there (a pregnancy scare that seemed to mean nothing to nobody; a classically cliché one-punch fight) caused one star to be taken away. <br/><br/>Strange that Edward Norton's character went from being prominent in the first half to almost ignored later on. Guess that's what happens when you mess with the director's daughter. <br/><br/>Inarritu is a force. I loved Babel as well. His use of slight time shifts is great.

To further expand the stressful feeling, Birdman's film score only contains percussions.<br/><br/>In supporting roles we see Naomi Watts and Edward Norton as fellow actors in Riggan's play, but also Emma Stone as his daughter and Zach Galifianakis as his agent. Several of the actors, including Michael Keaton, have said that making the film was one of the hardest things they have done so far. Alejandro also stated that a lot of people around him thought the idea was crazy and would be extremely difficult to finish.<br/><br/>The funny thing about Birdman is the subtle hints to reality. Michael Keaton himself is an actor who previously played the superhero Batman on screen, and the film includes small references to this.

The very second that this movie decided to put in superpowers (maybe as a metaphor for the superhuman feelings that some Hollywood stars have) and show the main actor flying around (and I very well understand that he might not really have superpowers and it more about the metaphor), I just disconnected. I must admit, maybe I am too simple minded, that movies like Birdman, Naked Lunch or most of Lynchs work don't interest me too much. Despite this I could enjoy Mulholland Drive (so maybe I am not a hopeless case), but when it becomes too crazy, I disconnect and this makes those movies not even bad, but boring.

Some like it as a form of art, some look it for entertainment, some look it for whole other reasons. I have seen probably 10.000s of movies in my life and a movie that tries to do things differently is really a great thing. But Birdman is a bit too far away from being a story. I am happy for everyone who likes this movie, but it surely wasn't for me. I can understand why some people love this movie, but I surely don't. <br/><br/>And this is OK, everything that counts is the respect that we should have for other opinions. Not everyone who is different from us is dumb. They are just different. Like this movie... it is just different."
"thinslicing","9","0","2","7 March 2016"," Such a polarizing movie.
","So many 1's and 10's, I'm not sure I've seen such a polarizing movie since Napoleon Dynamite. <br/><br/>I remember first hearing about this movie, mostly secondhand. All I knew was it was called Birdman and had Keaton. I couldn't figure out (or bother to search, too lazy...) if it was Birdman from the spider man comics (""uh isn't that vulture man?..."") or from the Adult Swim cartoons or no wait, from the Marvel Universe! Oh well, as much as I loved Keaton I only like about half of the big budget comic book movies these days (Captain America, Dark Knight etc) and hate the other half (Thor, Guardians, Man of Steel). I figured I'd wait to see Keaton in a 'real' movie. <br/><br/>Then a friend asked if I had seen Birdman. I explained why I hadn't and they replied ""no...it's not like that at all. Just see it if you get the chance"". <br/><br/>So, I saw this movie without being fooled by the ad campaign for it AND without knowing it was a 'meta-artsy' piece. I loved it. <br/><br/>This movie is so well done on so many levels the negative reviews are simply baffling regardless of what got people to see it. Why are you tiring yourself trying to figure out where the edits are? Why are you dismissing it as trying too hard? Who ELSE would play a former superhero actor who walked away from untold millions in the form of yet another sequel?? How is this movie unfunny? ""I think I'm hard"". ""No, you're just too serious with people sometimes-"" ""no I mean I'm hard. Let's do it. Let's really ****!"" And ""...tapping me on the balls with a tiny hammer..."" And ""he quit? I thought he got fired?"" ""With Mike it's usually both"". <br/><br/>And how can a movie be too artsy? There's an art to action movies, ya know. Go to any video store and pick up any C or D-list cheesy action movie and then realize that those people are trying to make a great movie. That's their limit. No matter how hard they try their movies will always be garbage. Compare that to the likes of T2 or Avengers. So, forget the notion that this is just an artsy movie. It's just a movie. <br/><br/>For the ""pointless lesbian scene"" comment I've seen in reviews - go watch Mulholland drive. And pay attention next time you watch a movie, Watts clearly says ""we share a vagina"" in the beginning. AND it's a joke on the somewhat dying trope of ""hey, let's have two hot chicks hook up in our movie"". They tease with it and never revisit it or expand on it in any way. So yes, it's 'pointless', but the fact that you missed that it's slamming every other pointless lesbian scene invalidates your criticism. <br/><br/>As for the drums, I think it's delicious that A) the director was bold enough to challenge himself and the drummer to do this B) it's slamming Hollywood (see the 13 drummers used on the man of steel soundtrack) and C) that it won the award for best soundtrack while being up against Whiplash. Absolutely hilarious."

","This is the definitive New York version of Tropic Thunder. Since New Yorkers have such monstrous cynicism, there is no deep meaning, like Tropic Thunder's ""Your identity is established by your friends."" This film is as smug as a Prius convention in San Francisco. I love it.<br/><br/>I am trying to craft the rejoinder, the reflection, of Woody Allen's ""In LA people just watch movies and eat dinner."" I tried ""In New York people just watch dinner and eat movies."" That's just a stupid symmetric turn-about. Naaa, but this movie, and Margot at the Wedding, and that movie about the kid and his NYC psychiatrist dad or whatever that emotion fest was, they hold the key for what New York is all about.<br/><br/>I think there is gnawing involved. When you pack rats together too tightly, or lets say when you pack small mammals together too tightly, they start gnawing on each other, until eventually they gnaw on their own little mammal feet until they bleed to death. Maybe that's it, ""In New York, people just gnaw dinner and then gnaw a movie."" Or actually, they gnaw a show.<br/><br/>There is a lot of gnawing here, and you are expected to join in. Two solid hours of gnawing, with unity of place tossed in for good measure.<br/><br/>You can see the LA/NY dichotomy quite clearly when you look at the batch of friends that came together to make Tropic Thunder vs this film. It would be fun to be on the Tropic Thunder set, whereas the Birdman set must have been a stressful hell, what with those long takes. New York requires suffering, from the snow and violence and dirt and from its art as well. Birdman channels Ricardo's labor theory of value via the self-flagellation of the Catholic Church channeled by Brave New World. They suffered, hence this must be good. Yeah, maybe so.<br/><br/>You might look forward to the Tropic Thunder sequel, but I doubt there will be anybody awaiting Birdman Too (the insufferably long sequel).<br/><br/>9 out of 10, but I would have given it a 10 if Kevin Kandenski walked out onto the set, the real film set of the theater set, set in a theater, looked around, and said ""How narcissistic are you people?"" Then it would be a little like Synecdoche, New York."

","From 2015, Birdman is a satire on show business directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, who was also a co-writer of the script.<br/><br/>The story concerns Riggan Thomson, a movie star best known for the role of the superhero Birdman and its sequels.<br/><br/>Now in a midlife crisis, Riggan has left Hollywood and is preparing to perform on the Broadway stage. The play he is starring in and directing is one that he is also coproducing with his friend Jake (Zach Galifianakis). It is Riggan's adaptation of a Raymond Carver story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. Riggan and Jake have put all their money into the show. <br/><br/>As the previews begin, there are problems. Riggan hates the actor in the supporting role. One of the women in the show brings in her boyfriend, a well-known actor, Mike Shiner. He is difficult to work with and also improvisational. At this first preview, he trashes the entire stage when he realizes the gin he is supposed to be drinking is water.<br/><br/>Riggan has hired his daughter Sam as his assistant; he wants to be there for her since she has just gotten out of rehab.<br/><br/>Finally the New York Times critic, Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) tells Riggan she's going to destroy his play and him and close it down opening night. <br/><br/>Riggan is tortured by Birdman's voice, feeding his insecurities. <br/><br/>Birdman looks like one long take, and it is accompanied by a beautiful score.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton is tremendous as Riggan. Someone said it was his last chance for an Oscar. When he's 100, that may be true. He did a fabulous job. Unfortunately one way to win an Oscar is to have some sort of implant in your mouth (see the book Flesh & Fantasy) so he lost to someone who had an implant in his mouth.<br/><br/>Ed Norton, for me anyway, almost outshone him, but Keaton's role was more layered and his performance matched it. Norton actually was doing a parody of himself and his bad reputation. He was perfect.<br/><br/>As Riggan's daughter, Emma Stone hands in another wonderful performance and the difficulty in their father-daughter relationship was well played.<br/><br/>Naomi Watts often ends up in these frantic roles at which she excels. Here as a young actress who's not sure what she wants but thought she did, she does a beautiful job, as does Andrea Risborough as Laura, an actress who tells Riggan that she's pregnant (by him). All of the acting is top notch.<br/><br/>I have a few things to point out. Whenever someone is in a profession and sees a film concerning that profession, that person is going to have plenty to say. I am no longer a New York actress but here goes.<br/><br/>The St. James theater is extremely prestigious; however, in its 80- year history, it's been used maybe twice for plays. The only one I can think of is Becket. And the reason for using that huge theater? It starred Laurence Olivier and Anthony Quinn and could sell out 1500 seats.<br/><br/>No actor would be caught dead in the dressing room inhabited by Keaton, which looked like a utility room. Actors usually paint, decorate, and furnish their rooms, even if the show winds up running one week. Whether Riggan would do it or not, the St. James doesn't have anything that looks like that serving as a dressing room. Could you see Olivier sitting in that thing? This film was supposedly using the St. James, but a very seedy part of the building.<br/><br/>This movie is a real knock at show biz. Actors trying to stay relevant, everyone and his brother being in a superhero movie (which used to be B movies), actors' insecurities.<br/><br/>Riggan's greatest fame occurs when he tries to kill himself and before that, being locked out of the theater in his underwear. This does him a lot of good on Twitter and makes him relevant.<br/><br/>He realizes finally that nowadays, success is success wherever you go. It's not based on achievement, it's based on people talking about you, on the ""buzz."" I remember Jessica Lange saying she went into theater because she hated the politics of films. When she got to the theater, she realized it was exactly the same. And if someone could star a Real Housewife or a Kardashian in a play, they would. They may still.<br/><br/>The final scene is Riggan's grasp on reality and understanding that he doesn't have to try to achieve anything. His daughter smiles because he's finally figured it out.<br/><br/>Not everyone liked or could even tolerate this movie; I suspect theater people might be more sympathetic to it. What we talk about when we talk about love -- it's for each of us to figure out for ourselves."

The movie starts out with something hitting earth from outer space and then him levitating in the air! The whole movie is a figment of his imagination! No? <br/><br/>Hallways turn into stage and back into hallways. One guy is his best friend, lawyer, producer, manager, masseuse, doctor, therapist and he is 30 years younger than him!? Floating in air, making things move, someone always passing in a hallway saying something supportive, drums everywhere, lights going on when needed, ""turn off the music""?!?! And of course the whole flying, jumping off ledges, roofs... I'm sure he has a wife and a daughter who is what all the critics say they are, should we see them in a real life scene, but seriously, in rehab they taught the daughter to dash 16000 dashes onto toilet paper?! She looks out the window and looks up at him? C'Mon people!<br/><br/>The director (real director) gets away with the single shot because there is no reality in connecting the scenes. It's all imagination! As soon as Norton tells him he is nothing a family with TWO KIDS is standing in the BAR and want his autograph?!<br/><br/>It's all in his mind. Start to finish. He is alone in his apartment with his make-up mirror table to make him feel like he is still an actor and the whole movie is in his head.

","In the movie Birdman, one man attempts to take a stab at a risky Broadway production in hope that it will reinvigorate his career. The movie follows washed up cinema superhero Riggan Thomson as he faces the negative spontaneity in Broadway, the voice of his alter- ego, and his family as he finds his way through the inner workings of Broadway. This film tackles themes that compare Hollywood to Broadway, the filmmaking and camera-work used has effects on the way the audience views the film, and the duality between Riggan and his alter-ego showcases his inner battle with himself. <br/><br/>Hollywood and Broadway, two separate entities with similar characteristics. In the film, Riggan is seen as more of a Hollywood actor due to his past role as Birdman in the popular Hollywood film. This poses difficulties for him to break into the world of Broadway since he's nothing more than a washed-up actor. On the other hand, Mike Shiner is a Broadway actor who made his fortune through theater and is the star pupil in Riggan's production. Due to Riggan and Mike both having different backgrounds when it comes to acting, they often display opposing viewpoints which allows the audience to differentiate between both worlds of acting. In one scene a fan approaches both Riggan and Mike and asks Mike to take a picture of her and Riggan, not knowing who Mike was. In a later scene Mike successfully defends Riggan's artistic ability to Tabitha, the theater critic who will review Riggan's play, since she doesn't consider Riggan to be an actor. This shows how being in Hollywood actor might come with a lot of fame and recognition, but being a Broadway actor allows you to have more credibility as actor. Another example of the clashing viewpoints between Broadway and Hollywood was in the beginning of the movie. Riggan's biggest critic claims that he is nothing but a Hollywood celebrity and will never be close to becoming a ""real"" actor in the world of Broadway. Later on in the film Riggan is confronted by his daughter who tells him, ""You are doing a play based on a book that was written 60 years ago, for a thousand rich old white people, whose only real concern is going to be where they can go to have their cake and coffee when it's over."" The first viewpoint shows how in the world of Broadway, Hollywood actors are just mere celebrities who have nothing close to the real acting talent possessed by Broadway actors. The second viewpoint explains how Broadway is more lackluster and boring when in comparison to Hollywood. <br/><br/>The film making and camera work made it appear as if the movie was one continuous shot. There were less than 3 cuts in the entire film and each cut would be disguised by visual effects the stitch together the seamlessness of the film. Having this long and drawn out way of viewing the movie makes it difficult to understand the reality that Riggan faces. The audience is never certain whether the scene there watching is real, or just another aside between Riggan and the figment of his imagination. Since most of the film took place backstage, using wide lenses allowed for scenes with close-ups to feel more memorable to due to the intimate images and small setting. Color's like green, red and blue were the predominant colors in parts of the movie, this is because all three are strong colors that enhance the drama and emotion in the film. Red and green were particularly used on stage during Broadway performances, while bright colors and a lot of artificial lighting was used to expose the true life of Time Square and New York in general. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, Riggan has to face the realities of existence and identity. He faces an inner conflict between him and the voice inside of him. The voices he hears is of Birdman, the superhero character that he was known for throughout his Hollywood career. The voice of Birdman would always cloud Riggan's judgment, insult him on his failure and mock him in all aspects of his life. The negativity of the voice in his head has driven Riggan to madness at times. Although Riggan has the clear intention to further his career by creating his own play, the voice in his head would always attempt to steer him away from his main goal. The voice of Birdman would always question Riggan's new career choice and would try and persuade him to go back into the movie industry and make another Birdman film. This shows how the voice of Birdman represents the past with respect to Riggans career. It represents the Hollywood side of Riggan that will always stay with him, even if he takes his career towards another direction.<br/><br/>The cinematography and the themes involved in the film Birdman show why the film won an Academy Award for Best Picture. The camera work and filmmaking throughout the movie made it so that the viewers felt more connected to Riggan and the rest of the characters in a particular scene. The subject of having clashing viewpoints between Broadway and Hollywood showed how both worlds of American entertainment differ from one another. The audience was also able to see the conflict between reality vs perception in the mind of Riggan as he battles his inner superhero from the past. All in all, Birdman was a unique film with an original plot that concentrated more on acting and drama rather than action and violence that movies nowadays focus on."

","Birdman is revolutionary in every aspect of its filmmaking. Even looking past the technical achievements, I found the film to mostly focus on bringing out multiple themes revolving around life, self dilution, modern media, human relationships, and entertainment as a whole. The use of long monologues and stretched scene duration meant to imitate a performance of a stage production are like nothing seen in cinema in recent years. Although the film seems to become preachy and pretentious at moments, it didn't take away from the cinematic experience. This film in moments acts as a showcase of Michael Keaton's acting talent in this performance of Riggan Thomson, a washed up actor trying to reclaim some of his former glory. The plot and strong characters of this film are extremely engaging and sit in your mind for hours after first watching the film. There are so many different ways to approach the actual interpretation of the movie's themes and symbolism in representing modern life. The manifestation of confusion that takes over in your first viewing is taken over by a thrilling joy in every viewing that follows because of the brilliant directing, writing, acting, cinematography, and score. The score, made up almost entirely of a percussive track at points makes the dialogue of the characters appear to be expressed as though it is powerfully written poetry, strongly coordinated with the rhythm of the drums. This is my favorite film of 2014 and I strongly recommend it to anyone who would appreciate a more experimental film about the entertainment industry and the human ego."

","I loved BIRDMAN. In the interest of saving space, I won't be referring to it with the extended subtitle: THE UNEXPECTED VIRTUE OF IGNORANCE. But, yeah, I loved this movie. After a few viewings, I've got no issue counting it among my all-time favorites. I know the movie has gained a reputation as being ""pretentious"" (that adjective has been thrown around a lot) with its heart-on-its-sleeve art house style, but I don't see that. I just see an energetic film with some good laughs and emotional moments. The insane amount of planning that went into the film to create the illusion of having been done in a single take is just an added level of respect. Whether this movie was written with Michael Keaton in mind is outside my scope of knowledge, but the role is certainly perfect for him. Keaton stars in the film as Riggan Thomson, an actor best known for his series of BIRDMAN comic movies. Thomson is getting older and attempting to leave his former rubber-suit days behind him; to do so, he has put all of his hope and resources into a stage play where he hopes to salvage his legacy and leave his mark on the world of art. There are only three days left until the big opening night and everything that can do wrong is going wrong. As it all begins to fall apart, his mind starts to unravel and he finds himself tormented with hallucinations of his most iconic movie roleBirdman.<br/><br/>Where to begin.? This movie really was phenomenal. It's got a nonstop energy to it. The camera is near constantly moving and scene transitions are accomplished by following a character to the next scene, as opposed to the usual editing. Gimmick or not, writer/director Alejandro González Iñárritu's choice to present the movie as one long uninterrupted take is impressive. You know it took an incredible level of choreography, long rehearsals, and multiple takes to pull it off so everyone on the cast and crew deserves major credit for it. The film injects an extra energy boost with its jazz drum soundtrack that plays over the duration. The movie just flies along and you can't help but caught up in it all. In this viewer's opinion, BIRDMAN is a piece of masterful filmmaking, adept at grabbing the audience's interest and not letting up until the credits roll two hours later. Technical end aside, BIRDMAN works as well as it does because of its incredible casting. At its core, I suppose the movie is equal parts black comedy and drama. There is definitely some serious material in here and a lot of the conflict comes from Riggan's family life but, no sooner than you are beaten down with a heart-wrenching father/daughter argument, you are right back into the comical insanity of Riggan's ongoing mental war with his alter ego or getting a kick out of Edward Norton's onstage antics as diva method actor that nearly brings the entire play to its knees.<br/><br/>This is the best I've ever seen Michael Keaton on screen. Granted, the role seems an obvious fit for a man who became a superstar in part due to his role as Batman in 1989 and 1992. He's fantastic in BIRDMAN and can portray a descent into madness with the best of them. But I have to say, no matter what was happening on screen or how Keaton was playing it, I always saw him as Michael Keaton. He never quite disappeared into the role. Keaton definitely has a style to his performances and all of his usual quirks are on full display. This isn't to take anything away from his performance. He was still amazing. It was just as if I was watching an alternate history Michael Keaton biopic, starring himself. Edward Norton is a scene-stealer as Mike Shiner, a last minute replacement in Riggan's cast who lives and breaths theater. Shiner is the ultimate method actor. When his character is supposed to be drunk on gin, he demands to be drunk on real gin. His character featured in a love scene? Why not have sex on stage? He's a basket case but he sells tickets, and Riggan needs him. Shiner is such a problem that he crosses just about everyone on cast and crew at some point, only seeming to find a connection with Riggan's daughter Sam (Emma Stone). I'm actually surprised Stone didn't get more awards for her role in BIRDMAN. It's more intense than anything I'm accustomed to seeing her in. Sam is a recovering drug addict, fresh from rehab and working on her father's play in an effort to help her stay clean. She harbors resentment toward her celebrity father who was never really there for her, and she has an incredible scene in the middle of the movie where she tears into him for his obsession and just leaves you speechless.<br/><br/>There are a myriad of reasons I could recommend BIRDMAN. It's scored some major awards and received loads of mainstream success, and it was all well deserved. It's a creative endeavor that most directors would've go out of their way for in modern film and it's pulled off with perfection. I love BIRDMAN and recommend it to anyone that hasn't yet had an opportunity to see it. Whether you find that you love or hate it, it's worth watching to see where you stand."

The camera shot, the direction, and the performances were perfect. I ended up rooting and empathizing with all the characters, especially Keaton's. Zach Galifianalikis' serious role as Keaton's lawyer was brilliant too and it captures the stress he endures to keep things from tearing apart. Edward Norton's role as a method-actor whose only way to be real is by acting also makes an interesting story. Emma Stone's portrayal as Keaton's troubled daughter was good too. But all these good performances are eclipsed by Keaton's performance. In fact it was so powerful I really rooted for him and was at the edge of my seat three times because of worrying for Keaton's character. That says a lot for a move that is not even a thriller. In the end, I think I will make time to watch it again. Michael Keaton is a brilliant actor, and deserves more good roles. How about a real Birdman movie starring Keaton?"

","I was going over when I was watching this film whether I should give it ten out of ten or a score slightly below that. So I sat down and thought about it for a while. And decided on the former. This type of movie deserves to be seen through the lenses of retrospect, so when faced with it immediately (or even about a year after release), we must scramble to put together our thoughts together before the leaves fall from the trees of time. This is another reason why I kind of fear becoming an actual critic, which is still a possibility; I'm still young. But I digress.<br/><br/>Honestly, this is a film that should be analyzed rather than reviewed. I think I'd make better heads or tails of it if it was released ten years ago. Nonetheless, there are a few things of which I am absolutely certain. First and foremost: I can see why this film won best picture at the Oscars. It is everything Hollywood likes, everything Hollywood likes to think it is, not yet ready to accept its fate as a hollow, money-making machine that occasionally produces something worth thinking about. Yes, it takes place on Broadway, but it involves a former film actor (a thinly veiled Michael Keaton, who I imagine took at least some of his personal feelings and through them into this performance). And even if it didn't, it is in the same ballpark. The emotions, temptations, yearning, and desire are not only Hollywood through and through, they seem to come from the very heart of Hollywood, if one could say that it even has a heart.<br/><br/>This makes it different from other Hollywood movies about Hollywood. This is one of the times when it's good that Hollywood people are so vain and make movies about themselves; it gives real perspective. It's exaggerated for cinematic purposes, of course, but you can feel that every emotion expressed in this film is an emotion that runs through the core of actors and Hollywood in general. It's cathartic. And that makes it pulse in resonance. It's like that rich kid who has so much but when he talks about the whirlwind of life he's in, you believe that he's telling the truth. If you still have no sympathy for that rich kid and are never a fan of pretentious films, you can skip this easily. But you probably would not have much interest in watching it anyways. For me, it stitches everything together and makes it pulse with electricity.<br/><br/>Two: the screenplay is one of the ten best I've ever seen. You heard me. Not good; not great; not outstanding: one of the best I've ever seen. It is primarily the reason this film I gave the film five stars. I could not, in good conscious, give this film anything less than a perfect score when it has a script better than even some of the best Woody Allen movies.<br/><br/>It contemplates on the dark nature of life, but saves the getting lost in it for the film, rather than unnecessarily making everything twisted, as is my problem with Kaufman scripts. It comments on the nature of society, both as it stands presently and will always stand. It does not shy away from delivering monologues but also does not drag the film down with them. In ways, it is like reading a book by one of the great authors (David Foster Wallace comes to mind) in that there is always something around every corner to be chewed on. It knows how to use humor; the movie is hilarious, but it does not stop for one-liners, as does something like The Avengers. In fact, the script, and perhaps, this movie as a whole, is oftentimes the diametric opposite of the Avengers, but that's a topic for another day.<br/><br/>Everything moves fast, but not too fast. It knows how to pace itself. But many movies can do that. This one knows how to use that space, filling it by extrapolating and connoting, while knowing how much to leave symbolic. A sign of a good, interesting, is that it depicts what you never think about but somehow know about, particularly the little things. This movie has that in spades.<br/><br/>Three: perhaps the first thing you will notice is the film's artistic style. It gives off the feeling that everything was done in one take, which, though it robs the film of some of the paused, cinematic scenes that would have made it better, is used for interesting effect, giving us scenes that we have never seen. But it is being used to best effect when the would-be revival play of the washed up superhero actor that is our main is acted. The lines between real and play blue, but not in a gimmicky way. It seems seamless; for that, I say it is a net positive decision and one I am glad they made.<br/><br/>There are not enough calm scenes and the climactic scenes are not as grand as they would like to be. But one can almost excuse that as part of the film's theme; of a man chasing the acceptance of others even to his demise. It may not capture me entirely, as my top 50 films are wont to do, but even in its faults, it is glorious.<br/><br/>And be sure to stick around to the end. It's interesting."

","After watching new film after new film for years and only now and then naming something as ""good"", Birdman was a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Iñárritu did not limit the potential of this film to the usual expectations of a public, and this is why the film is so esthetically pleasing as well as eye-opening. He combines elements that other directors would never dare to combine -reffering to the CGI- and creates a masterpiece. It is clear that every element in this film (setting, score, mise-en-scene, camera-work) allows the film to take shape without needing unnecessary dialogue making us, the public, appreciate Iñárritu's clever direction. <br/><br/>The ambiguous tones of this film are something that are too rarely seen today, giving the public the opportunity to think for themselves rather than be ""spoonfed"" the information.<br/><br/>It is rare nowadays to find a director so daring and innovative as Iñárritu, a director that refuses to follow common trends."

","I had initially decided to NOT see this movie based on the negative things I had heard about it. But how can I be a real movie fan if I refuse to see a Best Picture winner? I can't so I did. On DVD from my public library.<br/><br/>At its core this movie is critical of the success of meaningless action blockbuster movies, successful because that is what audiences want to see. That is what sells tickets. And to put my ""viewer hat"" on for a second, often that is why we see movies, to get away from reality and be entertained. <br/><br/>But what about more legitimate actors and legitimate stage plays? Why can't audiences enjoy those just as much? At the center of this fictional story is Michael Keaton as Riggan. Some 20 years earlier as a man of 40 he was ""Birdman"", a type of superhero. (Maybe spoofing ""Ironman""?) Now having turned 60 he is looking for something meaningful and also to dispel the constant nagging that maybe he never was any good anyway, just an actor with the right franchise at the right time.<br/><br/>So he writes, directs, and stars in an adaptation from a short story. I have been in plays and have worked behind the scenes and the movie fairly well depicts what goes on there. The rehearsals, the insecure actor, the disruptive actor. So by the time final rehearsals are at hand and opening night on Broadway looms, Riggan is about broke and can't sleep much. But the play must go on.<br/><br/>There is a lot of whimsy in the movie, often it isn't possible to tell when we are seeing reality or when we are seeing Riggan's visions, as when he is actually floating in the air. No matter it all comes together and seems to be a worthy Best Picture winner. Although I must say this was not the best year for Best Picture candidates. Of the nominees I probably would go with ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", even more whimsical and more entertaining."

Michael Keaton plays actor Riggan Thomson who is attempting a stage career but struggles with his famous Birdman superhero films. This is Keaton at his absolute best as he struggles to maintain a sense of moving ahead both professionally and mentally. Edward Norton plays an egotistical actor brought in after an accident cancelled out the guy he replaced. Emma Stone is wonderful playing Keaton's daughter, an ex addict whose relationship with her father is distant. She serves as an assistant but becomes entangled with the narcissism of the Norton character. Naomi Watts plays a new actress who becomes offended when Norton takes sexual liberties with her live on stage. Zach Galifianakis plays Keaton's best friend and manager who struggles to deal with the media, particularly after the initial accident. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu does an impressive job at creating what appears to be one ongoing shot that is aided by incredible editing. The fantasy sequences involve Keaton and moving objects without touching, or the image of the Birdman character whose voice counters his throughout the film in discouraging fashion reminding him of his past image. Visually enchanting and often quite funny take on talents yearning to recreate the glory days when paychecks were big, yet they prefer to take flight in dark places where their careers may not soar.

","Unique, infused with magic realism, and featuring fine actors, I think I loved Birdman. People who've ever been involved in theater will especially like this film, I think. I'm not surprised it won lots of Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Special recognition goes to long shots that pan high up city buildings and follow characters around the small downtown theater, on-stage, along hallways, in dressing rooms, across backstage. All the while, middle-aged actor Riggan (Keaton) tries to prove he is not a has-been. I'm not usually a fan of Michael Keaton's, but he did well as desperate, generally kind-hearted, washed-up Riggan. Also, as seems to be the big trend in movies and shows like Orange is the New Black (I'm not complaining), Keaton was not afraid to look old and ugly for his role.<br/><br/>Now a word about the film score: in theory, jazz drums as the only soundtrack was a good idea, but after nearly two solid hours of incessant, aggravating, excruciating, hissing and spitting jazz drums, I wanted to kill myself. Other than that, no complaints."
"MovieHoliks","7","0","2","10 August 2015"," Bold Film But Little Surprised It Won Best Picture..
","I finally got around to seeing this past year's Oscar winner for Best Picture and Director (Alejandro González Iñárritu), and my first thought is bold piece of film making, but at the same time, I'm a tad surprised it won. Crazy, ""out there"", movies with has-been actors (Best Actor nominee Michael Keaton) don't win best picture too often, so kudos to the Academy. <br/><br/>Kudos also to Iñárritu, who conceived the idea of making this movie as if it were all done in a single shot. I've seen a few of his other films- ""Amores perros"", ""Babel"", ""21 Grams"", etc.. and this is unlike anything he has ever done before. The story follows Riggan Thomson (Keaton), a faded Hollywood actor famous for his role as superhero ""Birdman"", as he struggles to mount a Broadway adaptation of a short story by Raymond Carver. <br/><br/>At first, I'm thinking, okay, this is loosely based on Keaton's characterization of ""Batman"", but into the movie so far, it seems that his character Thomson is more of a straight-up leading man action star, as opposed to Keaton himself, who at one time was a comedic actor, then sorta went all over the place in various different genres-?? <br/><br/>At the heart of this movie is a story of mental illness, since his ""Birdman"" character has stayed with him and is basically controlling his every action. The voice we hear as ""Birdman"" sounds eerily similar to Keaton's own voice when he would play his version of ""Batman""- that deep, sorta raspy sounding voice that Christian Bale would admit he borrowed when he would later play the character in the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy. <br/><br/>Edward Norton is also good in the movie as an actor brought in late in the production to take over for an actor who was injured while rehearsing. Judging by the scene in the bar when someone off the street recognizes Keaton, but not Norton's character, I would say unlike Norton, his character is more of a traditional Broadway/theater actor-?? Rounding out the cast are Zach Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts. Big thumbs up for a good experiment in film making and storytelling. Raymond Carver himself would be proud! :)"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) was famous, many years ago, for appearing as the comic book hero Birdman on the big screen, but is now trying to rehearse a Broadway play that is premiering in a few nights, only for one of the key actors in the play to fall ill during production. Replacing him is loose cannon actor Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), whose reckless style endangers the production and forces Riggan in to a self imposed mental deterioration, where he's forced to put all the things wrong in his life, including his fractured relationship with his daughter Sam (Emma Stone), into perspective. All the while, his former superhero alter ego mentally tears at him and tries to live through him again.<br/><br/>Given the onslaught of superhero movies we've found ourselves hit with in recent times, if nothing else Birdman turns the genre on it's head, presenting a hero served purely for the purposes of a unique story and not derived from any Marvel franchise. It's a completely surreal, off the wall and daring concept, that many might not warm to the first time. But it's undeniably the product of an intelligent, outside the box sort of mind, that also manages some sharp stabs at social satire, with pop culture references thrown in, by the way of mentioning hot, trendy young actors (including Jeremy Renner) who are very much at the forefront right now.<br/><br/>As if the concept wasn't high end in and of itself, director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu also attempts a unique filming style, shooting events from Riggan's exit from the stage in a continuous loop, following him from every encounter there on. This is a different style, and requires you to stick with it more than the traditional style of cutting to the next scene, but on the other hand also adds an air of realism you probably wouldn't have otherwise got. If you can just stick with it and warm to it, the film might do more for you. Keaton is well suited in the lead role, in a role rather semi-autobiographical at this stage of his career, given his notability of playing Batman in the 80s. In far lesser supporting roles, Norton also injects the energy only he can to his role, as does Zack Galifianakis as his agent. Accompanying it all throughout is a bouncy drum and bass soundtrack that keeps it all flowing.<br/><br/>The concept has worn out a little the end, and becomes a little tiresome, and could have done with maybe wrapping up a little earlier than it does, but it's taken you on such a unique and surprising ride to that point, that you can't really complain. ****"

","With all the superhero movies infesting the screen, it was only a matter of time before someone decided to ask the question, 'What will happen to the stars once they get too big to fit into their spandex costumes?' Here, Michael Keaton once played the (apparently iconic) superhero 'Birdman' back in the early nineties. Back then he ruled the silver screen the way Robert Downey Jr and Hugh Jackman are doing today with Iron Man and Wolverine. However, that was then and this is now. The public have moved on and are more interested in Marvel's 'shared universe' than a man dressed up like a sparrow. So Michael Keaton must attempt to regain his former glory by flexing his acting muscles and put on a play on Broadway.<br/><br/>Easier said than done. He has to finance the thing himself and he's hardly a 'bankable' star any more. Plus his ego is so big that it needs its own dressing room. And, if that wasn't bad enough, his 'Birdman persona' occasionally likes to take over and point out all his failings. Naturally, all this leads to a recipe for disaster.<br/><br/>It sounds like fun. And it is. But it's an acquired taste and definitely won't be for everyone. It's longer than your average film (nearly two hours) and there are long periods of time when it's like nothing really happens apart from actors wandering from one part of a large theatre set to another (normally to shout at each other). I read a couple other reviews that only gave it minimal marks due to 'nothing happening.' I can see where they're coming from (although I don't technically agree) as there is little in the way of a 'story.' It's about a man, who isn't always the 'hero' he thinks he deserves to be, who is clearly having some sort of breakdown. Fantasy and reality are starting to merge and it's not always easy to tell the difference – for him the character and us the viewers. Therefore, there are bits of it that make you wonder how real they're meant to be. Again, this may put off some of the audience.<br/><br/>Then there's the soundtrack. It's mainly a vaguely hypnotic drum beat, endlessly repeated until it's finally parodied in itself at the end of the film – leaving us to wonder whether we're hearing the mindless repetition that actually happening in his own mind.<br/><br/>There's quite a stellar cast too. Edward Norton rivals Michael Keaton in the acting stakes, yet his character seems to fade into the background more during the final act.<br/><br/>If you're into a bit of slightly surreal drama with a hint of knowingness about it and a healthy swipe at popular culture then give this one a go. It's definitely not an easy ride and is not the sort of film you can just 'get' while it's on the background. Get in the mood for something deep and heavy and take a flight with the bird."

Twenty years prior, he made a popular superhero film, Birdman which not only spawned 2 sequels, but made a powerful effect on his personal life. He tries making a comeback with Broadway play, ""What To Talk About When We Talk About Love"" that may resurrect or end his career. He also tries reconnecting with his daughter, Sam (Stone). Norton (Fight Club) plays actor, Mike, Riseborough (Oblivion) plays actress, Laura and Watts (King Kong) plays actress, Lesley.

","First I really enjoyed this movie. Second there are quite a few things that seemed obvious to me. Keaton did not have any kind of powers, See one instance, when he arrives at the theater flying, while he really arrived via taxi ... And when he has a discussion with Birdman and at the snap of the fingers the action movie begins ... None of his tricks have any effect on any character / situation in the movie, but for the light incident, but that was a coincidence right? He was a necessary step in the story to bring in Norton, the non pretending actor. So to me he killed himself on the stage and had a BTW moment before the end of the movie to actually show us that he was able to create an extraordinary play that become a REAL tragedy .... He gave the finger to Birdman, made his best friend and happy, said goodbye to his wife and daughter and flew into him imaginary world ... And that is wrap. This in very simple words."

","Reminiscent of his tenure as Batman, Keaton is perfect as a washed-out celebrity famous for the eponymous role whose Broadway play acts as a reflection for his fear of worthlessness.

Met with overwhelming acclaim, including the Oscar for Best Picture.

There's even a Robert Downey Jr. joke. Because he played Iron Man. Get it? Oh yes. You're so original. Aren't you clever. Aren't you special.<br/><br/>No. You're a loser. You're washed up. Worthless. Just like that hack Iñárritu, who thinks he can prance from pretentious sob-fests like Babel and Biutiful to this piece of self-glorifying artsy trash. He thinks he can make fun of popular things and have everyone love him for it, that reminding everyone that actors are ridiculous is his meal ticket to even more critical success. And you're going to buy into it, and call this his 'masterpiece?' Pathetic.<br/><br/>You probably think it's so clever he cast that dirtbag, Keaton, and smugly bite your tongue from pointing out how deliciously meta that is, because not stating the obvious makes you seem smarter. You'd probably go as far as to call it some kind of ""a gleefully satirical commentary on our times,"" or use impressive turns of phrase like ""an elegiac rumination on the dichotomy between artistry and populism in a media-oversaturated postmodern epoch"". You WOULD call it hilarious, devastating, and riveting, and get off on ""discussing the increasingly anxious, claustrophobic blurring of fantasy and reality"" with your nerd friends. Wipe that stupid grin off your face when you think about Birdman yelling into the camera about how audiences love violence and action; I don't care how much it reflected your lame sensibilities. You were probably even stunned to silence by that pointless ending, just sitting there, your tiny brain overwhelmed, with the word ""perfect"" bouncing around your head. You probably even laughed at the cheap underwear gag, like a sap.<br/><br/>Ohoho, you DID, didn't you? You're more shameful than I thought. You little worm. <br/><br/>now you're preparing a pithy comeback about how you are a worm, who was devoured by the experience of Birdman? You disgust me.<br/><br/>Look at yourself. You were made for more than this. Sounding off, namelessly, facelessly, on the internet, about a film you loved so much that it broke your feeble little heart when the rest of the world loved it too and it won all of those rigged (Riggan. Get it? I can be witty too. Like Birdman) Oscars because it ruined your hipster cred of loving the little superhero spoof that could. You could have had the whole world at your feet if you hadn't wasted eleven years knocking off internet movie reviews in your basement instead of doing anything of value. You criminal waste of space. And no, cackling like a fiend at Lindsay Duncan's venomous theatre critic in Birdman doesn't make it better. You're still a failure.<br/><br/>Oh – but let's not forget to list all the little things in this little movie that made your little brain feel so many feelings. You could write an essay on Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography, and how it's so 'lively', 'effervescent', and 'innovative', positioning the audience as a ghost tramping alongside Keaton, watching him steadily fray to pieces (maybe we ARE the scary voice in his head. Does that make us Birdman? Ooooooh. Complex). You probably only love the long takes because you can smarmily compare them to Hitchcock's Rope from 1948. And let's not forget the drumming. You love drums, so you've probably convinced yourself the drum score is the haunting 'heartbeat' of the film – engrossing, hypnotic, ingeniously sparse. I bet you walked home from the theatre with spectral drumming in your head, trying to graft some second-hand meaning onto your useless life. Of course you did. Why am I surprised? It's not like you could be any tackier.<br/><br/>have you really sunk to individually praising the actors embarrassed enough to show their faces in this filth? Oh yes – casting actors from superhero movies like Edward Norton and Emma Stone is so terribly droll. You'd probably call their mugging here 'inspired,' that Norton is a 'hysterical live-wire of self-parody,' and that Stone doesn't just sulk like a petulant pre-teen – no, she gives 'the most ferociously raw and honest performance of her career.' Ugh. You probably thought that mug Galifianakis is so restrained and witty here, and that Naomi Watts, Amy Ryan, and Andrea Riseborough aren't just whiny caricatures – they're elegantly emotional. Right. And Keaton. Michael Keaton. You're just aching to call him Hollywood's comeback glory boy, as if lampooning his own sad career is so fearless. But you know better, I'm sure. You see a fiery light in his buggy eyes, like he's disturbingly in-tune with Riggan's madness. To you, he's probably tapped into an almost transcendent form of performance, and that his quirky twitches, manic braying and goofball staring into space is somehow a window into the human soul, or some drivel like that. We all know he's a Hollywood clown, so obvious and forced it makes me sick. But hey – look who's talking.<br/><br/>Oh. I forgot. Birdman is 'flooring, virtually flawless, and the most gripping, hilarious, fiendishly intelligent parable of the year – nay, of many years.' This is REAL ART. Like it's not a pedantic, overblown student film passing itself off as a modern masterpiece to all the sheep too stupefied to object. Whatever. You dote on your silly film.

","Birdman evokes mythical tales of tragedies and redemption, calling to mind for me similar mythically inspired tales such as The Wayfarer. What is most impressive (among the many most impressive facets of this movie) is that it does not sink into the pathetic while at the same time suggesting that is exactly what was going on with the play within the play as well as its characters. Birdman is no longer Birdman, but is a broke and balding man with a badgering id. His wife cannot forgive him. His new 'star' is impotent save for settings where it may bring the roar of the crowd. And so forth. <br/><br/>But most intriguing is the manner in which Birdman evokes how we talk to ourselves about who we wanted to be, who we are, who we wish to be again, and how we struggle with potency lost, and our unquenchable desire to regain our younger self, notwithstanding our certain knowledge that we were not all that great, particularly not to loved ones. Yet it is exactly as that lust for an imaginary past is relinquished that are souls are loosed and we are truly freed, truly possessed of a bit of invincibility, and a hint of immortality, and one never knows, perhaps a capacity for love.<br/><br/>I had not planned to watch this movie and was skeptical of its talent laden cast, thinking, uh-oh, this is about assembling a money making machine.

"jennalunaverse","10","0","3","1 August 2015"," Originality, Finally, and Birdman gets Low Reviews? Come on?!
","Birdman (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a solid, unique movie & to see ratings as low as 1 & 2 is just crazy to me. I know the big budget, CGI, ""Re-imagining,"" remake crap & sequels, superhero flicks (Gambit; really?) & lame board game movies seem to be what everyone wants, but when something awesome comes out, such as Birdman, Whiplash, or Boyhood, who were all competing for Oscars, (Birdman won for Best Original Screenplay & Best Movie) people say it was a ""waste of their time"" & ""they didn't get it."" Really? <br/><br/>It's a satire of what happens behind the scenes of a Broadway play. Edward Norton, for example, plays an exaggerated character to his real-life persona as a difficult-to-work with actor. In real life, Norton won't sign on to a movie unless he has script approval & can make rewrites. The first scene in Birdman when he & Michael Keaton's character, Riggan Thomson meet, Mike Shiner (played by Norton) gives Riggan tips, cuts lines, etc., which is true to Norton in the real world. With the satirical production of the play, there's the back story of Riggan's family life. His daughter Sam, played to excellence by Emma Stone; a reformed drug addict, now his assistant, & his ex-wife Sylvia, played by Amy Ryan. There's also his past as superhero/alter-ego Birdman; a movie dynasty that made him millions, popular, but considerably unhappy. He hears a voice in his head from the start of the movie telling him he shouldn't even be in the theater, he should still be doing Birdman. And he's floating. <br/><br/>What's so great about this movie is the ""what the f*!?"" factor"" Riggan can move things with his mind & float, but in a major scene where it looks like he's apparently flying over the city, a taxi stops when Riggan does at the theater & yells at him for cab fare. So, can Riggan make things happen with his mind? It's the wondrous & fantastical side plus the editing & cast that make this movie so incredible. Naomi Watts is truly at her best working with director Alejandro G. Iñárritu again. She worked with him in 21 Grams, as well, & he won an Oscar for that movie. Zach Galifianakis is awesome, as usual, as Jake, Riggan's lawyer. There are only 16 cuts in the whole movie. Iñárritu wanted to do Birdman in ONE take, but 16 cuts in 119 minutes is an amazing feat. Because of this, nothing was left on the editing floor & Galifianakis's lines, if he messed up at all, were funny enough to leave in & be used because some scenes were too long to start over. <br/><br/>It's a damn good movie. It's worth the watch. The ending will make you go, ""oh my hell!"" & then you'll be uplifted. Movies don't have to tie up in pretty little bows at the end. Does life do that crap? No. Why should movies? Birdman is entertaining, it's Michael frigin' Keaton in a starring role, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts making out with Andrea Riseborough,, Zach Galifianakis being super dominating, & you get to see Edward Norton's ass. What else do you want or need?"

","Birdman: what I believe to be by far the best film of this year, birdman is my favorite for 2 reason. 1) I saw it very recently, and the super original story and actually incredible cinematography just flat out blew my mind and 2) going into this mans life, understanding his thought process and such, I haven't had this kind of experience in forever. I love action, as seen by this list, but my truly favorite are films that blow my mind, such as 2001: a space odyssey and more recently, the artist. Birdman is a truly original story, with an incredible performance from one of the best casts in recent history, perfect score, direction, cinematography, and just amazing filming overall. I hate to do this, but the best has to win, and with a score of 9.3, birdman your the champ. Fun fact, apparent Michael Keaton Edward norton and everyone else had a bet to see who would screw up the least and most. Apparently Emma stone screwed up the most, with zach galifianakis of all actors having the most success.

","Anyone who has had ever had any kind of mental issue, or is creative in any way, and/or has ever felt insecure about their art, or wants recognition for it will understand and identify with this film from the opening reels. <br/><br/>This really is one of the the most powerful films I have ever watched, and can only imagine that the people who don't like it must be devoid of any emotional empathy. The storyline is captivating, the dialog brilliant, and the acting as good as I've ever seen in any film. Both Keaton and Norton were amazing. Never have I felt, or cared for a character in a film more than I did for Riggan. Throughout the film I was mesmerised by the story but having no idea of where it was going I found myself frequently and desperately hoping that the plot would turn one way or another to protect the character.<br/><br/>There have been a lot of comments on here about the 'annoying drumming soundtrack', however once again I think the people who have complained about it are the same ones that don't understand the film. When the drumming it used It's MEANT to be annoying and intense, and play with your mind - that's why it always appears at the times that Keaton's character is at his most disturbed. It helps you identify with him even more. <br/><br/>This is not a relaxing film for a Sunday afternoon or something to numb your mind with after a hard day's work. I felt absolutely drained after watching this emotionally and physically, however I cannot recommend this film enough. Having said that I imagine (and the reviews on here suggest it) that not everyone will 'get' it or appreciate it. Some people will absolutely hate it. But, if it does click with you, if you do 'get' it, if you feel it like I did, then watching this film will be one of the most powerful cinematic experience I imagine you will have for a long time."

","Nice to see good work go pop for a change. My only reservation at calling this 'a real creative work' (there's very few of these in audio/video, at least that I've heard of) is a question I should have to ask if this IS a real deal: lots of the 'working actor' level is written in cliché. Of course, this fits in this kind of realism (frequently Spanish). The probability is that it is on purpose, whew, I can keep my inspiration from this film. There is a lot of it, though. The casting of Keaton cries out as he is ALWAYS FUNNY, and Galifianakis (who I've never liked in a movie) ditto; they're surreal from the get-go. >>>>> Best hand-held EVER. Combined w/the 'painterly' 'live' mix (lots of single quotes, this guy is ALIVE) it becomes a kind of 3D swim. >>>>> Inarritu planned the action-painting, instead of 'finding' it amidst years of pre-planning preparation more usual by actioners. Audio/video makes for a kind of tight milieu because of the whole history of the gestalt; kind of a modal-guard in place. Of course, the planned structure/tactics allowed for all kinds of spontaneity, so, more than enough air to fly. >>>>>> I hope this film stimulates like ""Pulp Fiction"" cause we sorely need for this kind of A/V to proliferate. >>>>> The binary system we live in would be awfully dull but for a number of treats in the mix, such as '2 for 1', e.g.. Being binary, triads abound, both outside and within the 'set'. However one can find this trick of transcendence in the box of Kracker Jax will always pay off. Being in one set is a necessary limit to allow for seeing outside the set which is 1+1 making a third, a triad which allows you to move on to the next level (finding the origination outside the set within the set itself, self-reference, another hot concept). All this SOP for creativity. >>>>> Levels woven by hand-held and various other segues, brilliant. Kudos to El Negro! >>>>> I especially loved the study of modes as useful in making the levels. Modes are so great, so are modals. ""Everything is alive!"", allows for subtlety using the components of modes, styles. It allows for 'corny' dialog, clichés, etc. You almost have to use them in this kind of environment. >>>>> Best of all was the layer of the spiritual (Inarritu's fiery Mexican trumping the shiny metal of the USA). >>>> I create this way and know it well. Lovely to see it done so well. I was inspired by it; that's what creativity does. (I particularly enjoyed the nose shot: pride.) Similarities to ""Vanilla Sky""."
"Screen_Blitz","8","0","2","5 July 2015"," Maybe not would I consider Best Picture of The Year, but it is true cinematic artwork
","The Hollywood industry is a place full of mind-boggling mysterious and complexities, as well as a place where fame of America's most glamorized celebrities are uprooted; and director Alejandro G. Inarritau delivers a powerful vision on this concept. This artistic 116- minute character study allows for audiences not just to experience a colorful story of a washed-up actor's rise from rags to riches, or it's cast of A-list actors shine with highly charismatic performances; but also some awe-inspiring social commentary tackling the rocky world of celebrities in the showbiz. The final product is a film that not only sees the actors expand upon their incredible cinematic abilities, but an inspiring innovation uprooted by Inarritau's gorgeously smart direction. Birdman: Or(The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomsan, a formerly popular Hollywood actor known for his iconic as ""Birdman"" in a popular superhero franchise, who has been facing troubles with his career and his divorced by his wife Sylvia (played by Amy Ryan). In attempt to reignite his career, Thomson is chosen to direct a play at Broadway with the help of his lawyer Jake (played by Zach Galifianakis) and his pot-addicted daughter Sam (played by Emma Stone). His job only ends up more difficult than he expected when he not only must work with hard-headed actor Mike Shiner (played by Edward Norton), but also battle his inner demons that have put a major that unsoundly made a mess of his career.<br/><br/>This engrossing dramedy doesn't exactly break any cinematic barriers, but I would be lying if I said this isn't an inspiring cinematic experience. This film was very decent. Although I didn't find it be what I consider the best film of the year, I was pretty enthralled with it. Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis, and Edward Norton are all given their time to shine here, and the sheer commitment they display on screen is virtually impossible to ignore. Michael Keaton's plays what can easily be seen as a meta-role as the main character is drawn as formally praised actor who rose to fame starring as a popular caped crusader known as ""Birdman"" which falls eerily coincidental to Keaton's real-life career as Batman during the early years of his career. In addition, the performance he lands in this role is truly uncompromising and engaging from start to finish. It is genuinely hard to think of any other actor would nail this role better than Keaton. Along side this fine actor is Edward Norton playing a volatile actor with a glamorous reputation onstage, but a prickly attitude behind the scenes. His role serves almost as an analogy of his real-life persona offscreen (though not in a way that's meant to be a parody of himself), and the performance he brings to the table is nothing short of fascinating. With his lack of roles over the last a few years, he seemed he might have flown off the map, but luckily this sees him in a triumphant return. Emma Stone, playing the drug-addicted daughter of Michael Keaton's protagonist, also takes some good time to impress with her immersive talent.<br/><br/>While the cast manages to fascinate in the acting department, the film hits its highest notes on a technical scale which is accomplished by the astounding beautiful cinematography by Emmanuel Lubetzki who demonstrated some engrossing talent in Alfonso Cuaran's 'Children of Men' along with 'Gravity'. With the film pervading with only sixteen visible shots throughout it's near two-hour runtime, viewers watch as the cast takes a daunting task of sustaining strong and powerful performances through a short of series of long, uninterrupted shots lasting roughly 19 minutes. It shows that Alejandro G. Inarritau out in some great, extensive time for the cast to rehearse. Though the cinematography isn't what I would say groundbreaking, it is incredibly admirable and easily the film's biggest gem. In terms of the narrative, the film provides a sweet, engaging story of man's journey through the showbiz; complete with masterfully written script and three- dimensional characters. Though the story succeeds on providing some nifty commentary on the entertainment industry including the downfall of fame, the overwhelming effects falling center to the public spotlight, and criticism by film critics; the story isn't always as interesting as it's intended. Sure, there are plenty of moments of light-hearted humor and appropriate ingenuity, but the film also some moments of tediousness. But with Inarritau's stylish direction in driving the film, these flaws aren't too hard to forgive. <br/><br/>Birdman is a solidly entertaining piece of cinema sparked with Alejandro G. Inarritau's engaging direction, some powerhouse performances by a larger-than-life cast, and an overall powerful artistic value. Though it may offer much groundbreaking innovation beyond the technical scale, it is true demostration of director Inarritau's talent as well as the cast; and as a result earns a spot as one of the best movies of 2014."

'The Big Lebowski' didn't have much of a plot - and what there was took several viewings to actually figure out - but that was not the point of the film.<br/><br/>What was the plot in 'Lost in Translation' or 'Clerks' or even 'American Graffiti', really?<br/><br/>I really liked Birdman.

Sometimes, at least for people like me, that's enough.<br/><br/>The irony is, the people who didn't like 'Birdman' would probably more enjoy a 'real' action movie. You know, like The Avengers, Batman, or Green Lantern. If you went to a theater, or rented this thinking it was that kind of movie, I can understand your disappointment, but it's like doing a negative review of 'Steel Magnolias' because there wasn't enough botany in it.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film that's clearly not for everyone - especially those who require explosions, villains, and breasts."

This film is truly unbelievable, and any review that says the story is shallow, or it lacks an exciting story, can easily be proved wrong by the Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay.

","So this is what won the Oscar for Best Picture. The days of something like Titanic winning the award seems long gone now. Then again, most of what's popular are usually some special effects-epic that doesn't say anything particularly important, just meant to entertain for a couple hours. And that includes many superhero pictures that are permeating the industry right now. Michael Keaton plays an actor who once was part of that crowd when he was Birdman. Now he's trying to be legitimate again by starring and directing himself in a play based on a Raymond Carver story. Shot in what seems like one continuous take, this film is a compelling take on art vs. commerce, realism vs. simple playacting, and sanity vs. insanity. Keaton, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, and others do fine performances on how some actors cope with whatever insecurities they have when things don't always happen like they think they should. All I'll now say is Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is well worth seeing if you want your brain picked on for a couple of hours."

Obviously only if you liked it. I can understand that some might find this ""boring"" or not interesting enough, especially if you don't care or don't make connections like Michael Keaton having played ""Batman"" and knowing about being famous once (and a super hero for that matter).<br/><br/>So if that doesn't float your boat, forget about the rest. Just relax with the ""worst movie ever"" sayings. That'd be nice, especially because it just doesn't fit. To be in that category the acting should be off and the technical aspect worse than a really bad student movie. But it isn't, it's the opposite. The story is actually gripping if you can get behind it, not to mention the relationships between the characters (what a cast by the way). I loved it, as my rating already suggests, but the quirky humor and the pacing will not be everyones taste.

There were many scenes and sequences that left me scratching my head, wondering what the aim was. Although, I believe the good scenes far out-weigh the not so good scenes. I believe that my favorite aspect of the film was the character performances. Keaton was well deserving of the Oscar. Edward Norton's presence impressed me, as well as Stone's and Galifianakis's. I am also a huge fan Riggan's (Keaton) ego, ""Birdman."" It is a display of sheer pride that puts the viewers right into his inner struggle.<br/><br/>After watching the end of this film, I was not quite sure what to think. I didn't know whether I liked it, was on the fence about it, or if I just absolutely hated it. But after thinking, I decided that I had liked it. This film, to me, was one of a rare breed. Things happen so quick, scenes seemingly run together, but I think that adds to the chaos and the struggle that Riggan is dealing with. He is juggling between actors, scenes, critics, and money, all while attempting to fight his ego.<br/><br/>I title this ""You May Need To Look Twice"" because this movie may require two viewings to fully grasp its idea and its aim. Luckily, I was able to (at least I think) understand this after just one viewing. I will more than likely watch it again, just to see if things change.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10"

The picture views the comical and stressful background of a washed-up actor who is desperately trying to evade criticism and his ignorant alter ego. This movie contained a fantastic lead performance from Michael Keaton, and even better presentations as Sam, Mike and Jake, played by Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis and Edward Norton.

Or find amusing? Neither. By the time Riggan confronts the make-you-or-break-you critic whose review, she predicts, will kill Riggan's play and career (Lindsay Duncan as Tabitha - best or least overacted performance?) I agreed with her assessment: ""Entitled, selfish, spoiled children"". As I had company arriving I switched the DVD player off and only watched the last quarter next day. Ironically, as soon as it morphs into the sort of SFX, CGI blockbuster territory that Birdman (the superhero) inhabits, my interest perked up. To the extent of deciding to watch it again. Well, at least it's not Titanic. Stand by for 2nd impression! NEXT DAY: on second viewing I warmed to Birdman. Perhaps I was feeling more empathy for the character of Riggan (which name, pronounced by American actors, sounded more like Regan, King Lear's ungrateful daughter). I smiled more at the wit and soared more at the ending. I still don't know what we're supposed to make of Riggan's telekinetic powers - are they real or fantasised? observed by others (as in the final frames, his daughter looks up to see Dad in the air)? or simply a metaphor for power? Never mind: it's a movie that stretches the envelope and that, if nothing else, has to be a Good Thing."

","Birdman is about Riggan (Michael Keaton). Riggan once was a successful actor of a popular superhero. The hero was ,ofcourse, Birdman. but times flew by and he has become less popular. Now he tries to redeem himself by writing a new play whole by himself. He will also direct and ply in it. The movie follows Riggan how he handles his new play, how critics react to it, how he reacts to critics, about his own family live... An example of the critics: in the movie at a certain point, Riggan is sitting in a bar and meets this girl. The girl turns out to be a film critic. And before even watching his play, she says to him that she will write a bad review about his play. <br/><br/>The movie is directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu. Before I watched this movie this director was an unknown man (for me at least). But he did an amazing job at directing, I really liked the style. But it must have been very trying for the actors in it. I have read in the 'trivia' that they had to learn more than 10 pages of script. But as I have said, I loved the directing<br/><br/>Now the actors and the script. Micheal Keaton is good in the movie. He did a good job and I have nothing to say bad about his preformans. But the actress that had the best lines and did the best acting job was, in my opinion Emma stone. I loved her in the movie. when she was saying to her dad (Micheal Keaton) that he isn't the only one fighting to be relevant. I absolutely loved that scene, it was my favorite scene of the entire movie. Edward Norton did also a really good job. I didn't like the personality of his character as much. It's like Joffrey Baratheon from game of thrones. Everyone hates him, but he makes the people hate him (if you know what I mean. The script of the movie is very well written, and as I have said, that the 'relavant' scene is my favorite scene, but there are a lot of other scenes that are equally as good. Overall I thought that Emma stone got the best lines form the hole movie.<br/><br/>The movie is also pretty funny at times, but also dramatic during the end of the movie. A funny part is when Riggan walks through times square in his underwear. or when he jumps of the roof an thinks he is flying, but actually took a taxi. And than the most dramatic scene, when he tries to commit suicide in front of a live audience, an in the hospital, when he jumps out of the window.<br/><br/>I Really liked the movie and here are some individual scores:<br/><br/>Directing: 10/10<br/><br/>Acting: 9/10<br/><br/>writing: 10/10<br/><br/>thats a total of 29/30 which is rounded 10"

The movie shows the roller-coaster ride that is his mind, plus the behind-the-scenes goings on of the play.<br/><br/>Certainly not your average movie. The blurring of the lines between reality and fantasy, as the lead character veers constantly between delusion and actuality, is incredibly intriguing and not a little disconcerting (and this is not necessarily a bad thing). <br/><br/>The plot is simultaneously simple and complex - simple main structure but very complex in the intricacies. Ultimately it is a character-driven movie, and the characters are well-developed and complex.<br/><br/>On that note, it is not all about Riggan. There are some sub-plots involving his daughter, Sam (played by Emma Stone) plus other cast members. These non-Riggan moments provide for respite from the intensity of Riggan and his issues, and are a welcome relief.<br/><br/>While it is the script and direction that set up the movie, it is the performances that complete it - casting is spot-on and the cast act of their skins. <br/><br/>Superb performance by Michael Keaton in the lead role - he well deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination.

","I have recently finished watching Birdman for the second time and I think I finally understand what the draw was for this movie. To begin with the movie mentions several different actors and celebrities through out which make the movie an all around fun experience. But what is really important in this movie and what most people miss, is the powerful messages director and writer Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is trying to get his viewers to see. <br/><br/>Of all the messages that are trying to be made two are very important. One is the idea that we all think we are important in this world but we are really not (this is taught to us through Michael Keaton's character Riggan). The second is that we all think we are unimportant but we are actually all very important and special (this is taught through Michael Keaton's alter ego Birdman). In addition Inarritu is showing us several other things like the struggles of actors whether it be how stressful an acting life is, like Riggan's, or how insecure actors really are like Mike Shinner (Ed Norton). He also touches on the relationships between father and daughter, husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, and a relationship between friends. Each one of these relationships contains a different lesson as well.<br/><br/>Since there are all of these messages to take in plus the constant distractions of Riggan's thoughts and ""powers"" the ideas people are supposed to get from this movie are lost.

Michael Keaton is great in this role. As was Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, and the rest of the leading players.<br/><br/>There is an element of magical realism. It is a literary script.

","This movie is tony awards opening (120 minutes version) for me. Tony awards opening is live, I suppose. But this movie is not live. Just had long take! I know that long takes has meanings. But I want to watch the pressure of acting. Actors had pressure because of long takes. That's little bit ridiculous. If they are great actors, they can act of pressure like live. They don't need long takes do they?<br/><br/>Russian Ark(2002) is more artistic and poetic. CG artworks are more amazing and importance in Black Swan. This movie remixed many ideas from a lot of films. (That's not bad way if you want to make movie.) But nothing added itself.

","Aside from one hiccup I didn't care for in the film, I really enjoyed ""Birdman."" <br/><br/>The cast is great and they are all giving off tremendous performances. It's not really a surprise that Michael Keaton is great in it but it is a surprise how he seems to get better and better with every project. Additionally, I was really digging the story and the fact the film is made to look like one continuous shot ended up working in concert with the story and making the plot feel even more immersing and interesting. Granted, this had the potential to come off like a gimmick and could have worked against the film and story but, in the end, it worked very effectively.<br/><br/>My only complaint about the film is the commentary the movie makes about comic book films and critics. Being a fan of comic book movies and a wannabe movie critic, I wasn't so much insulted by this but rather taken back by the childish-like nature of it and its complete lack of subtlety it contained. It became breaks in the film that suddenly went from being a funny, dramatic, and incredibly entertaining to being sorta pretentious, snobby and pretty petty and whiny. Thankfully, this only happened twice before it went back to being a great character-based piece of work."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","3","9 May 2015"," Interesting technique, good characters
","Birdman garnered a lot of attention for its rarely seen cinematography, its interesting story and for its ensemble cast of actors. And deservedly so, because all those elements are what make the film so enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>First of all, the cinematography where the whole film is made to look like one, long, continuous shot. At first it's kind of attention-stealing, because you're looking for it, but surprisingly soon you kind of forget it's there and only notice it when the film calls attention to it by, for example, walking through halls to get to other characters. There are also a couple timeskips achieved through seeming fast-tracking, but those are also tasteful enough that it doesn't pull you away from the story. All in all it's a gimmick, but it's an interesting one.<br/><br/>The story and the characters are what make this a good movie. The story is about Riggan, an aging actor, who is mainly known for his role as an early cinema superhero, Birdman. And now he's trying to regain some credibility by producing a play, where he's also the main actor and the writer. What's makes this so brilliant is that they got Michael Keaton, the guy who's mostly known for playing Batman years ago, to play him. If that isn't perfect casting, I don't know what is. And Keaton absolutely owns his role. Nigh perfect acting, not just from him, but also from pretty much all the main actors. Emma Stone and Edward Norton are especially noteworthy for their characters and their own subplot.<br/><br/>All in all Birdman is a love letter to theater and to acting in general. It's a character study that examines the themes of loss, past fame, credibility, love both young and old, endurance, frustration and most importantly doing what you love. Well worth a watch."
"lucasversantvoort","8","0","3","5 May 2015"," Iñárritu's most personal film to date
","Birdman is the most recent outing by director Iñárritu whom you most likely know from such films as Babel and 21 Grams. Back them he was still working with writer Guillermo Arriaga, but after they had a falling out and so Iñárritu had to find help for his scripts elsewhere. That he did and Birdman is the most impressive result of this collaboration.<br/><br/>Birdman is the story of film actor Riggan who was once known for playing superhero Birdman, but now seeks to conquer the theater in a bid to be taken seriously. He transforms the Raymond Carver story (""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"") into a play which he himself acts in, produces and directs. He risks everything, all his money and so on, to make this a success, but of course there are obstacles. He's not only confronted by his own ego in a Batman-esque voice-over, but also by a last-minute replacement actor and the ways he's failed as father and husband.<br/><br/>I'll be honest and say Birdman is difficult to review. It's one of those films that's not only incredibly meta, but also deals with the very concept of reviewing. To then simply note some pluses and minuses would therefore be quite insufficient, although that's what reviews boil down to, right? It also doesn't help that the film seems to take on so many themes that I don't feel it did right by most of them.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the film definitely has flair, its own style, both dramatically and comically. There were moments where I genuinely felt I was watching something 'new' again, something that hadn't been done before, or at least not in this way. If you ever think to yourself, 'man, where did all those visually stunning movies go?, then Birdman is required viewing. After Biutiful almost drowned in its own melodrama, I feared Iñárritu might've lost his touch, so his decision to inject a healthy dose of humor into Birdman was definitely a right one. The film has so much flair, but let's be honest: when Emmanuel Lubezki is your cinematographer, you're in good hands. If you've seen Children of Men, you know what I'm talking about. Just like that film was immediately renowned for its long shots, Birdman is shot and edited to appear like one continuous shot. And before you say it's a useless gimmick, remember that theater too is 'one continuous shot'; it provides a nice dose of 'realism.' You could regard every cut in a film as a moment where you're taken out of the experience, at least subconsciously, because the cut reminds you of the fact you're watching a film. Birdman of course uses editing to achieve this effect, but tries to hide it a bit like Hitchcock did in Rope. Not only does this increase the sense of realism, but the tension is also heightened. Speaking of tension, Antonio Sanchez's drum score deserves a lot of praise and is sure to rekindle discussions about whether or not drum solos can be 'original 'scores.' You can hear it on YouTube, but you need the film to truly appreciate it.<br/><br/>Regarding the acting, I can't say a lot that hasn't been said already. Michael Keaton is great, obviously, but Emma Stone (who has the best single rant) and Edward Norton (as the a little too dedicated actor) also deserve a lot of praise.<br/><br/>The story's great too, but (like I said earlier) I can't help but feel the film treats its topics and themes a bit too haphazardly. Birdman has something to say about pretty much everything and in that sense it reminds me of Save the Tiger. Birdman tries to be about human relationships, failed relationships, failed marriages, fathers, the film-theater relationship, the relationships between actors, between plays and critics, between those who produce and critique, notions of acting, selfishness, art, the way social media influence things on a professional and personal level, rehab, theatre in general, the way actors are on-stage and off-stage, etc. Yeah...unsurprisingly, the film leaves some of its plot elements unsolved, like the blossoming yet very dubious relationship between two characters which is never mentioned again or a random lesbian scene which is also never mentioned again. The humor is also very hit-or-miss. I like the parodies of the press, actors (the reference to Meg Ryan's plastic surgeon!) and the movie bizz, but other jokes (""We share vaginas"") had me confused But these complaints are extremely minor compared to the thrilling overall experience.<br/><br/>I tend to see Birdman as Iñárritu's answer to Miyazaki's The Wind Rises, though not literally of course. If The Wind Rises is Miyazaki's attempt to reflect on his career and ask, like his protagonist, whether it was all worth it, then Birdman functions in similar fashion. Of course, Iñárritu still has a long career ahead of him, but it's interesting that for the first time he's explicitly asking questions about 'art' and all the efforts and self-doubts one experiences during the creation of art. Asking these questions means making yourself vulnerable, opening yourself up to criticism and Iñárritu seems to agree with Riggan when the latter verbally shreds a critic to pieces. He's putting his reputation on the line and fully commits to his play. In the end it's crucial to block out the dissenting voices, both the external and internal ones, and in this sense Birdman is Iñárritu's most personal film to date."

"allexand","7","0","3","17 April 2015"," It's a bird, it's a plane, it's an over-the-hill actor who's losing his mind
","""Birdman"" is the tale of a has-been superhero actor trying to mount a comeback while preserving his own sanity and failing miserably at both. It's probably best known for winning the 2015 Best Picture Oscar and featuring Michael Keaton running through Times Square in his undies. While it is an excellent movie, however, it has some faults that I just couldn't ignore.<br/><br/>The casting of Michael Keaton as an actor trying to escape typecasting and Edward Norton as an argumentative prima donna method actor is genius and they give great performances to boot. The normally slapstick Zach Galifanakis is nearly unrecognizable and it took me half the movie to figure out it was him. Emma Stone and Naomi Watts give terrific performances though it is hard for them to outshine the main stars.<br/><br/>The plot is simple yet full of possibilities. Keaton plays Riggan Thompson, a has-been attempting to put on a Broadway play to energize his career and hopefully make people forget his most famous role, that of a comic book superhero called ""Birdman."" However, Murphy's Law seems to be working against him in every way possible. A cast member gets injured and has to be replaced last minute by a demanding jerk named Mike Shiner(masterfully played by Norton). Shiner makes things difficult by upstaging Thompson in interviews, sabotaging performances and harping on Thompson's attention to detail. Thompson then nearly screws himself over by getting locked outside of his own theater in his underwear just before his big scene. Thompson struggles to keep his play together in the face of mishaps, vengeful theater critics, and the erosion of his own sanity.<br/><br/>There are many great scenes to be found here. Thompson's repeated failures to put on his play are both funny and sad due to Keaton's honest performance as both Thompson and Birdman, his imaginary tormentor. You can really feel his shame, his defeat and his slow descent into madness even as those around him try to reassure him that there's no such thing as bad publicity. Norton has many great moments such as wrestling Keaton in a speedo, hitting on an actress while naked in his dressing room, and then attempting to rape said actress backstage before a bedroom scene because he wants the audience to believe they were really doing it. She manages to fight him off but he shows the audience a visible erection. Thompson verbally sparring with a stuffy New York theater critic is another major highlight of the film because both make valid points while defending their own points of view.<br/><br/>The film itself is shot in a way that's quite fascinating to watch. The camera follows the character-in-focus everywhere, through cramped stairwells and hallways onto rooftops and through crowded city streets until it's time to shift to another character where it continues to follow them all around. The movie looks like one long unending take with occasional breaks to let characters sleep. The shots don't even cut away for Thompson's increasingly absurd daydreaming sequences, one of which involves Godzilla-like monstrosities demolishing the city. It's quite surprising to know that this film didn't win an editing Oscar because it truly looks seamless. There is one awkward moment where the camera is focused on an empty hallway for about fifteen seconds, which considering that the camera is always following somebody, is rather jarring.<br/><br/>That brings us to the movie's shortcomings. While it is a small gripe, there are lots of wonderful in-jokes peppered through the movie about specific contemporary respected actors cashing in on superhero movies and Hollywood's willingness to milk the franchises for all they're worth. Sure, the references are funny now, but they will probably date the movie.<br/><br/>The most serious strike against the film is its pacing issues. As I watched it, I thought it was about to end with the first flying sequence but I found there was still another half-hour left. Thompson was so far gone by that point and we last see him on a ledge so it seemed logical that the flying was his dying dream before hitting the pavement. It seemed like a wasted opportunity considering that the actual ending was somewhat similar and made less sense. It started to drag so much that I stopped caring about what was happening in that last thirty minutes. There was also a lesbian makeout scene introduced which went nowhere and had no foreshadowing.<br/><br/>I really didn't care for the spastic drum pounding throughout the movie. I don't know what they were going for but it just made the movie seem horribly pretentious. They occasionally worked the drumming in with a real-life street drummer and marching bands beating drums in the street which was cool but the syncing with the bizarre credit sequences was just silly.<br/><br/>Also, I don't get what was up with the subtitle, ""The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance."" It's only said once at the very end and doesn't seem to apply much to the movie as a whole. It seemed like something they tacked on because they didn't feel the movie was artsy enough.<br/><br/>It really is a shame that these flaws bogged the movie down because other than that, it's well-made, highly entertaining to a certain point, and has a lot of interesting ideas and scenes. If it weren't for these flaws, I would've given it a higher score. That doesn't mean it's not worth checking out though."

","Birdman caught me by surprise when I was reading movie news one day. I saw that Michael Keaton was starring in it as Riggan Thomson, and I knew it would turn into something special. When I first saw the film, I was heartbroken because of the ending. It was beautiful seeing Sam (Riggan's daughter) looking into the sky smiling. Many people say that this film is horrible or a disgrace to be the best film awarded at the Oscars but that's not true. Birdman is a story about many real actors who lose popularity and have to find something to make them rise back to the top. The part that everyone should note is Birdman is a reference to the 1989 version of Batman because it changed that genre of films. Birdman shows that when someone is forgotten and is only known by the sweatiest of nerds, it can break them. Birdman hints at Hollywood's desire with money by selling people explosions when Riggan's is thinking about the future of Birdman. During the end of the film, Riggan knows that he doesn't need to act to find happiness and success, but he knew that couldn't live with the burden of Birdman. At the end of the film, Sam looks down and sees her dad, but she looks up because she knows that he's flying. Birdman shows that the ignorance of people can lead to their undoing. People lead hard lives, and it is hard to go on, but people will argue that suicide isn't the answer. Riggan's had only a day of being famous, and he knew that that was all he needed to be happy."

","Birdman [2014] is the critically acclaimed dark comedy and drama (directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu) which presents washed-up actor Riggan (Michael Keaton) in and around his new debuted Broadway play. <br/><br/>Quality casting. Time and time again, usually big names attached to movies tend to hinder a films credibility, merit and sometimes ends in disaster (ala Movie 43). Then there are movies that are the exception, the cinematically exceptional Birdman. The actors fit their roles like hands to a glove. Michael Keaton, largely known from his widely released Batman [1989] is Riggans. Edward Norton plays Mike, acutely intense stage actor. In some circles Edward Norton is rumored to be every bit as intense and committed to his role (ahemallegedly). Norton is charismatic and Keaton is sympathetic. Of course, special mentions go to Emma Stone (Riggan's daughter, Sam), Amy Ryan (ex-wife of Riggan) and Naomi Watts (the female lead of the play, Lesley). <br/><br/>Ideal marriage of style and substance. As you are probably aware, Birdman is shot in one continuous take. Instead of limiting the audience, Alejandro González Iñárritu creates enough realism to transport us into the screen without boring us to death with it. Truly captivating, the visual style is only aided by the score comprising of drums and several pieces of superbly selected classical music. Special effects are used sparingly, and with purpose. Riggans inner monologue (or 'mental formation') is the husky voiced superhero Birdman (sounds just like a certain famous bat superhero) presents his state of mind. The substance lies within the dialog. It's fresh, hilariously written in its dark comedy and poignantly real to life in its drama. Birdman is meta. It's a film that uses the backdrop of Hollywood to examine something that's universal: striving to receive validation and the lengths we go to satisfy the ego."

","""Birdman"" is a rare kind of film for its kind: a raw and flawed masterpiece. The story is quite simple but is told in a narrative that is both consistent and inconsistent. The characters are real (both literally and figuratively) but are not developed enough to the point where an audience can sympathize or connect with. It's a real fantasy land of what people envision the world of show business. What makes the film a masterpiece is its execution: the acting, the cinematography, the set decoration, the sound, and its direction are all top-notch. Many critics call this a satire of show business, but personally the film satirizes the bipolar notion of success and failure of one's life in a nutshell. Michael Keaton's character is not just satirizing himself, he is satirizing human ignorance. Birdman succeeds on a level in which I cannot possibly write about because it cannot be explained."

All the actors did an amazing job, but i have to talk about one in specific, my favorite actor, Ed Norton. Finally he comes back to a role that fits his ability of acting, Ed is a great actor, and as fan is painful for me to see him portraying certain characters such as Hulk or Eisenheim (""The Illusionist""). I appreciated his role on ""Grand Budapest Hotel"", it was flawless but he deserves much more camera time. He deserves leading roles.

I found it inspiring, in a way that it showed Hollywood as it is, and the actors are people just like us, regular people, who struggle to fit, to be approved, to be significant somehow, to something or somebody. I don't think there were any lose ends, as i read on one of the reviews, everything was settled at the end. There aren't lose ends when it comes to our dreams or aspirations, our personality and our ego, we're constantly changing, and re-thinking our acts and what we portray to ourselves and others...

Like Riggan too who had to strut down Time Square in his undies, we have to meet our curve balls in life with a brave face just so we can get back onto life's stage to continue with our parts. As the character Mike Shiner said, the only real moments for him are those on stage. In this movie, the stage is the epiphany of life . The movie intertwines between what is real and what is even more real brilliantly with a mastery help from a camera that seamlessly blends the two levels of reality together into a magical continuous shot. That execution of inseparability is a stroke of metaphorical genius. The finale is of course with Riggan playing his part out with a real gun, this perfect union of stage acting and reality wins him back the affirmation of greatness from Tabitha, the theatre critic for the New York Times who initially denied him recognition for she thinks as a Hollywood star, he can never be real enough for theatre."

I was famous and suddenly I'm not anymore, let's try again, but without thinking what I really want. Just to be famous?

Plus Emma Stone, whose performance as Keaton's daughter was outstanding. She brings so much passion to a role, ie; The Help. Quite the dynamic actress who will no doubt be around for years to come.

"fullheadofsteam","7","0","3","2 April 2015"," Best Acting, Best Directing yes, Best Picture of 2014, Maybe Not
","This is a most intriguing picture, insofar as while it mines themes previously explored in movies, it does so with an absolutely amazing fresh approach, brilliant cinematic style, and some of the best acting talent on display. The themes it explores are not original -- male midlife crisis, self-doubt about being an artist, and regret about failed parenthood. It also takes a swipe at Hollywood establishment movies, which is not original. However, this movie takes such themes to an extremely personal level in the main character, with a commercial movie alter-ego in full combat with an inner artist who longs for the live stage as an ultimate defining dimension to define his legacy. The torment here is not unlike 'Barton Fink', and so while reiterating that the movie plows old ground, Michael Keaton takes it to the most profound, and thereby compelling level. For this, he definitely deserved the Academy Award and the Golden Globe of Best Actor, hands down. And Edward Norton, as both an intellectual and artistic foil to Keaton's character fully warranted the Best Supporting Actor award. Add these absolutely brilliant performances to the Director's style, which involves the longest single-pull shots and carefully orchestrated actor movement since Robert Altman, and you have a movie that cannot be ignored or relegated to any level lower than Good or Very Good. Was it the very best motion picture of 2014? Sadly, no, not among those nominated, and noting of course that those nominated seem to have been somewhat hit-and-miss, but then aren't voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences a real mixed bag anyway?!"
"left-of-center","8","0","2","1 April 2015"," It's Not A Pretentious Film; It's A Film About Pretense
","I can understand why the immediate reaction to a film like Alejandro Innaritu's ""Birdman"", a comedy-drama about a has-been film actor, Riggan Thompson (Michael Keaton), trying to be taken seriously with his Broadway debut, could be to label it ""pretentious."" Making the film look like it was shot in one take? All the actory talk about acting, truth, selling out, etc.? So, unsurprisingly, it's turned some moviegoers off while being embraced fully by Hollywood, winning the Best Picture Oscar, among others.<br/><br/>But, in my eyes, it's not a pretentious film. It's a film about the pretenses that can drive the entertainment industry, in one way or another, leading to both the success and the breakdown of its stars.<br/><br/>Riggan is pretentious for thinking going to Broadway is his shot at being a legimitate actor, a claim he's taken to task for by his recovering drug-addict daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), who's now his assistant. For many actors, the theatre is true art, not Hollywood movies. Consider the pretentiousness of Riggan's co-star, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), a dedicated Broadway actor who is a little too Method for the rest of the cast's sake and spouts off phrases like ""Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige."" Consider the snobbishness of the theatre critic (who is purposely the biggest caricature in the film) who tells Riggan she'll rip his play to pieces in her review, just because he's a movie star, famous for playing the hero Birdman in a comic-book franchise decades ago because, you know, she's such a theatre purist.<br/><br/>Innaritu is not praising actors and kissing their you-know-what through this film. I don't see this as a shrine to the entertainment industry. It's a savage satire, with Innaritu directing his same brutality and fierce honesty toward the genre of comedy. The actors in this film (not the actual actors, but the characters) are full of insecurity, veering from self-regard to self-deprecation in equal measure. I think it would be a mistake to say that Innaritu believes that ALL actors and artists are this way. But, this is the psyche of the archetypal artist: tortured, driven, self-absorbed, desperate for approval. And it's all of this desperation that drives the conflict of the story.<br/><br/>No one embodies that more than Keaton in this film. Riggan is narcissistic, for sure. But, a pathetic narcissist instead of a rude, mean-spirited one. Keaton navigates his way through all of Riggan's humilitation, doubt, fear, and false pride with great skill and fearlessness. In my mind, he should've won the Oscar.<br/><br/>Norton and Stone also received Oscar nominations for their work. Norton is as impressive as Keaton, to a scene-stealing degree, which is appropriate for his character. Mike is much more unpalatable, but often to a hilarious degree, yet Norton also shines in the moments where his guard comes down. Stone effectively drops her usual bouncy, cute-girl charm, turning in a tough, fierce performance, as probably the only grounded character in the film (besides her mother and Riggan's ex-wife, well-played by Amy Ryan). It's a true ensemble, with Zach Galifinafikis, Naomi Watts, and Andrea Riseborough all shining in their roles.<br/><br/>You stop noticing the visual tricks of the film after awhile. You enjoy it on more of a subliminal, subconscious level, especially as the film starts becoming increasingly dream-like and surreal. As the film builds to its climax, it leaves you on edge, questioning what's real and what's not. Riggan loses himself deeply in the process of trying to become great to a disturbing level.<br/><br/>It's certainly not a film for everyone but shouldn't simply be dismissed as pretentious crap, either. I think, if you have experience in the arts, you're much more likely to enjoy it."
"dolphinsareevil","9","0","2","31 March 2015"," Birdman: Or (The Unexpected favourite of 2014)
","Mid 2014 I began to notice trailers for this curious little flick and didn't think much of it but as time rolled on with watching 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and keeping up with the barrels of news Marvel dish out, with The Avengers and soon-to-be Avengers. Birdman really interested me as a commentary of the recent trend of superhero films that we're seeing lately. Don't get me wrong, I adore the recent releases from Marvel they are a happy medium of money making for the studios and complete passion projects for the directors and cast involved, it's a win win scenario, so enjoy it while it lasts as I do! But, what will happen when these films become tiresome and we move onto to the next crowd pleaser's? This is where Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) takes centre stage. Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu known for directing Babel and Starring Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson as a washed up actor trying his to reinvent himself as a 'true'actor in Broadway as a writing, directing, starring in and co-producing. Taking all this on after a blitzing career as playing 'Birdman' on the big screen. Keaton is support by Emma Stone playing Riggan's daughter Sam and Edward Norton playing Sam, a fellow actor and a wall to bounce off for Riggan. Right off the bat we hit the first cookie to hand to this film which is the casting. Anybody who has watch anything would recognise Keaton as our previous dark knight in Tim Burton's foray into the Batman universe. That would have been perfect enough but oh no they went even further by bring in Norton and Stone. One who took up the mantel as Bruce Banner in 2008's Incredible Hulk and the latter as Gwen Stacy in Sony's recent attempted reboot of Spider-Man. The relevance of these 3 actors in this movie is incredible as each offer a different personal experience each has gained from working in super hero films themselves and this translates in their performances creating brilliant chemistry on screen especially between Keaton & Norton which I crave to see in more films as I did in this. A surprise addition to the casting brought Zack Garifianakis as Jake who is co-producer and best friend to Riggan not to mention a stellar example of Garifianakis as a serious actor which again I crave to see more of in the future.<br/><br/>Another gold sticker for this film has got to be for the cinema photography. MY GOD! I swear this film only cut 2 or 3 times and even then that was towards the end of the feature which is nothing short than editing and filming genius of the highest regard! For anybody who is studying media, film studies or how to be awesome this is the film to watch and to soak in!<br/><br/>What about the meat and bones of Birdman though? What about the major draw for a film? The story. I won't give anything away which makes it hard for me to doubt what I can say is that the brilliant casting and cinematography compliment the story perfectly. You care for each of the characters equally you see their highest points and their lowest, unravelling little shines of their past and how the characters bounce from each other is a sceptical to behold, as I mentioned before the chemistry between Keaton and Norton is brilliant and can really drive the humour home for this film.<br/><br/>After so many things done right for this film why not a 10/10? Really I personally felt the film pulled out for too long, I have no issue with long films however Birdman seemed to have pulled a Columbo and had just one more thing before it closed curtains. It didn't ruin the film completely but it did make me ask why keep going? I just can't help but gush about this film though so i'm giving it a glass of milk for it's cookie and gently kissing it on the head before bed simply for the music score. The majority of the film is nothing but jazz drums which just works brilliant for the style of the filming. it flows and builds and pauses at the right points which is impressive to say the least! Over all Birdman is a must see and a marvel (see what I did there) of modern cinema though I do feel the story had an opportunity to finish sooner this was a stellar production. Alejandro take a bow as you've created a new favourite for me and hopefully a few more in the years to come. 9/10. now take your milk and cookies, you've earned them!"

","When I first saw this movie, I thought that it was going to be a superhero movie. But it wasn't! This movie is a satire on Michael Keaton's life and showbiz whereas SINGING IN THE RAIN is a satire on the arrival of talking pictures in 1929. Birdman is a parody of the BATMAN films he worked on even the character's voice is a spoof on the recent Batman films by Christopher Nolan. It is amusing that it almost looked like that it is done in one take, but it somehow there were editing shots spliced in here and there. The music is good and it is worth the watch. Naomi Watts was in this movie as Lesley and she was in Peter Jackson's KING KONG remake. Michael Keaton is going to be in a prequel to KING KONG called KONG: SKULL ISLAND along with J.K. Simmons (of WHIPLASH fame) and Tom Hiddleston (who was Loki in THOR and THE AVENGERS) which is coming out in 2017. I say bring it on! Bottom line: Great psychological drama. Rated R for strong language, violence, nudity, sexuality and drug use and reference."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","4","26 March 2015"," A flawed work of genius?
","I managed to catch ""Birdman"" while it was still on the big screen but, by the time I did this, the movie had already garnered four Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. Most of the Academy's voters are actors and this is very much a film about acting and actors. If American cinema-goers had voted for Best Picture, ""American Sniper"" would have won hands-down and has taken more money that all the other Best Picture nominations combined. I admired both works - but they could hardly be more different.<br/><br/>While ""AS"" covers a lot of ground, both in terms of geography and time, the action in ""Birdman"" largely takes place in a New York theatre and, although the narrative traverses several weeks, the shooting contrives to give the impression that, in the main, this was a single take (you have to look much closer than in Hitchcock's ""Rope"" to spot the 16 actual cuts). If ""AS"" is about a man that most Americans see as a hero struggling with his inner demons, then ""Birdman"" is about an actor who used to play a superhero devoured by his demons. One of the many delights of the film is the delicious irony that the eponymous superhero is played by Michael Keaton who, of course, once portrayed another black-clad, caped superhero.<br/><br/>But while Keaton gives a tour de force performance which gained him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor (it went instead to Eddie Redmayne), like any good play this is an ensemble piece with a slew of fine thespian displays. Leading the pack is Edward Norton, but the young female stars - Naomi Watts, Emma Stone and Britain's Andrea Riseborough - are all impressive. And both the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and the jazz drum music from Antonio Sanchez add to this marvellously accomplished work.<br/><br/>If one person has to be singled out in assessing ""Birdman, it must be the Mexican Alejandro González Iñárritu who directed, produced and co-wrote the movie. Maybe, just maybe, however, the whole thing is too artful, knowing, contrived and ultimately - dare I say it - pretentious. So many lines of dialogue, so many scenes, shots and props, can be seen as alluding to another character or another film or capable of several interpretations. Indeed the title itself involves an ambiguous sub-title and even then the parentheses do not enclose the word 'or'. Perhaps this is a flawed work of genius that, while never less than utterly absorbing, tries just a little too hard to be so clever."

","Well this movie was quite a ride, I'll give it that.<br/><br/>This isn't all spoilers, and I be sure to specify.<br/><br/>Birdman is a movie about a watched up actor trying to be relevant again, but it also takes a look about many things. What does it mean to be popular? And what kind of popularity is best. How far will you go to save your career, or should you ignore the naysayers around you? <br/><br/>First of all I'll say the acting was incredible! Michael Keaton did pretty good, and it was great casting, and was probably on purpose, as he played Batman back in the early nineties. Edward Norton and Emma Stone really stole the show for me. Edward Norton's character was so out there and the way he portrayed it was so fun to watch. Emma Stone did great, including one monologue near the beginning where she captivates you. We are going to watch her amazing acting our whole lives, unless she changes careers. Zach Galifianakis did amazing, and is completely 180 of what you expect from him. I am not as surprised, sometimes the funniest actors can be great serious actors(Jim Carey, Robin Williams.)<br/><br/>The fact that must of the movie is made to look like on shot is fantastic. This isn't just cool looking, it helps with the claustrophobic feeling that you are supposed to get from Michael Keaton feeling the pressure to be relevant again, the constant drum soundtrack helps with this as well. <br/><br/>Lets talk about the presentation of the story. While I like the story and it's message, I don't like how they presented it. This is where spoilers start. I feel like they tried to combine to much stuff into one movie. The whole messages of how to deal with popularity and critics, and not worrying about other opinions and trying to do what you love as an artist, got lost in Riggin's(Keatons) own story. I felt as the movie kept switching between a very straight forward approach at it's meeting, to a very artsy approach. I appreciated individual scenes, and what the characters said, but then got lost with a different subject or turn in the narrative. The voice in his head was enough to show his past Birdman life pulled on him, we didn't the whole question of whether he actually had powers. That then made the ending very confusing to everyone, and think it is confusing because it may just be a bad way to handle it. The taxi man driving him back to the theatre after he ""flew"" shows that he didn't actually have powers, why have an out there ending where he might actually have powers? It would have been darker, but maybe the movie should have ended with when he shot himself, or with Sam embracing him in the hospital. Maybe I just need to see the movie a second time.<br/><br/>In the end, it won best picture, so it is worth a watch. Do notice the hidden messages in the movie."

This movie is of the typical style the academy likes, focus in the human mind and its properties, but the plot is not too dense or symbolic enough to make it hard to understand. The final scenes makes it clear the the main character is already dead, he is imagining before his death a happy ending for his story, and as all his imaginary realities, it doesn't work in accordance with the laws of our world. Its the only part of the movie that requires our focus and attention to detail in order to understand it. The rest is just nice, not challenging, a film to relax.

","A very sharp, sassy script and a convoluted, but engaging, examination of reality, theatrical reality, media reality and self- perception, 'Birdman' shows just how good Michael Keaton can be, with good material. Casting a film about a washed-up superhero actor trying to prove his worth (to his family, himself, his audience and the world in general) by staging a self-penned Raymond Carver adaptation, with actors who have associations with such franchises, was clever. It plays on our own perceptions. Is Keaton the volatile troubled soul in real-life he appears to be on screen? Is talented, over-analytical anal-retentive Edward Norton mocking his notoriety as a 'difficult' actor to work with? The interior of the theatre is used really well, helping to variously establish, remove and self- consciously muddle the different 'realities' at various points in the film. I like this movie, also, because it means I can say something nice about Zach Galifianakis...whose insensitive dork schtick I really can't abide, but who does some solid straight-faced character acting, here, as Keaton's slightly camp lawyer."

Inarritu puts showbusiness front and center including Michael Keaton's character's mental illness induced supposedly by his own vanity. There isn't much to relate to for me in this movie. I don't care about fame or theatre art much per se, and the storytellers have Keaton lashing out at himself mainly in response. Their answer? His character committing suicide, so instead of learning to be comfortable with himself, the storytellers glorify his tragedy. This was not a great movie to say anything of an Oscar. You may find you enjoy the acting, bravado, or even his tragedy, but although performances were OK, I didn't find it entertaining much 6/10 - and a disappointment, unworthy of a nomination to say anything of Best Picture.

","Alejandro González Iñárritu's 'Birdman', stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson, an ageing movie star whose glory days seems to have dried up decades ago. Desperate to recapture recognition and relevance, Thompson sinks all his time and money into writing, directing and starring in a Broadway play adaptation of Raymond Carver's 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love'.<br/><br/>Thompson is buckling under the pressure, close to a breakdown. Surrounded by friends and family who have their own share of problems, from his daughter and assistant Sam (Emma Stone), his friend and lawyer Jake (Zach Galifianakis), to his girlfriend and co-star Laura (Andrea Riseborough), up and coming actress Lesley (Naomi Watts) and egocentric superstar Mike (Ed Norton). They all contrive to dismantle and fix something that maybe never should have existed.<br/><br/>Iñárritu bravely shoots the film as if it was in one take, the camera flows in and out of various rooms in the theatre, following all the various characters in a whirlwind of actions. The film has an elegant dynamism, but you are never allowed to ponder moments any longer than a few seconds, as if the film depended on it. As beautifully constructed as it is, Iñárritu keeps things fresh by avoiding complete precision. The random and the inexplicable are allowed just as much space. The films tension and free- wheeling energy is also derived from the manic scenarios and the uneven jazzy drum score, in an all-or-nothing journey into Thompson's mind.<br/><br/>'Birdman' is a dizzying and absurd experience, and Iñárritu leaves no stone unturned in savaging the vacuous world of Hollywood celebrity, showbiz and our relentless pursuit for shock and entertainment. Not only does 'Birdman' take potshots at everyone from Meg Ryan to Justin Bieber to Robert Downey Jnr, it includes its own actors with thinly veiled nods to their previous output, methods and celebrity profiles. Its a shame that for all its biting lunacy, the story is a well-worn path with few insights. For all of the films technical marvels, its Keaton's bravura performance which shines through and defines this ambitious film, his electric descent into chaos and salvation is surely his finest performance."
"fung0","6","0","3","9 March 2015"," Interesting Experiment
","Worth seeing for movie fans, but mainly for the technique, not the content.<br/><br/>Inarritu pulls out all the stops, shooting in almost one seamless take. (Spotting the cuts is about half the fun - unfortunately.) Cinematically, the film is arresting, almost breathtaking. But only barely entertaining.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, throughout. Micheal Keaton is excellent as usual, though I'm not sure this is his best performance ever. (He was at least as good as the charismatic psycho in Desperate Measures, for just one example.) It's a shame he was passed over for the Oscar, he's one of the best actors in Hollywood, and probably overlooked mainly because he's associated with comedy rather than drama (though he's done both superbly).<br/><br/>The problem, as others have pointed out, is that Birdman just doesn't add up to much. (MILD spoilers, nothing to agonize over, especially in this largely 'plotless' film...)<br/><br/>Keaton is frantic, insecure, vainly trying to take his career where it probably doesn't deserve to go. But you get that in the first five minutes. After that, you have to grab your pleasures where you can. For example, the underwear scene is fun, but it works as little more than an aside. Its strong reception from the Broadway audience doesn't seem to greatly affect Keaton's approach to his play. The sub-plot concerning Keaton's daughter is similarly wasted, as is the beautifully ambiguous performance by Ed Norton as Keaton's bombastic co-star - a character who totally dominates the first half of the film only to go strangely missing in the last act.<br/><br/>The pay-off for all this is minimal. What does the ending mean? Bottom line, not much. All the technique lavished on this threadbare story can't replace the substance that's just not there.<br/><br/>Birdman reminded me of Black Swan, another bit of overblown Oscar-bait that offered great technique and lots of angst in lieu of saying anything particularly novel or interesting about the theatrical life. Birdman is a much better film, and a far more entertaining one, but still not exactly a must-see."
"robsta23","9","0","4","7 March 2015"," In My Top 3 of 2014
","Whereas Boyhood was monumental in that it took risks in the fact that it was shot over 12 years, Birdman is monumental in that the film is essentially supposed to feel like it is all done in one long take (aside from the beginning and ending of the film).<br/><br/>There are many great aspects of this film, the first being the amazing cast of actors. Michael Keaton leads this cast with an incredible performance, having to show different personalities through his Birdman persona as well as the washed up Riggan, who is very passionate about the performing arts to say the least. I have not seen The Theory of Everything, so I cannot call Redmayne's win for best leading actor a snub, but I can say that Keaton was at his best and I am glad he was considered for the Oscar.<br/><br/>My favorite performance of the film, however, comes from Edward Norton, and this might be my 2nd favorite performance of the year behind J.K. Simmons in Whiplash. Norton is this superhero of an actor, Mike, who is so devoted to realism that he drinks actual gin to get the feel of an era, or that he ""gets hard"" as he delves into a sexual experience his character is having. It is particularly fun to watch him give suggestions to and act in front of Riggan to show true artistry - Norton's acting within acting is right on the money.<br/><br/>As for the visuals of this film, A+. Amazing concept to do a film in one long take (what is supposed to feel like one take) especially when this take requires moving the camera all over the place around this theatre setting.<br/><br/>However, this film does seem overly repetitive at points, striking home the idea that we're not living as we are meant to live. This comes from lines such as ""stop looking through your phones and actually experience something"" and various ""rants."" While I am a big fan of monologues, this film seems a little monologue-heavy in order to get its philosophy across. Emma stone rants about how Riggan wants significance in his life though he is not important; Riggan rants to the critic that she doesn't truly understand meaning (or significance); Norton rants that you have to delve into literature - in this case plays - to find their significance; you see the pattern, right?<br/><br/>I like the ambiguity of the ending, but it could have ended stronger in a different spot. This different spot I refer to made my heart race so much during my first viewing of the film. I will not spoil the last shot of the film, but I like that though it does not give a clear explanation of its final shot, Birdman meshes the realistic with the unrealistic, just how Riggan has been in and out of the unreality of the play he is putting on throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film; a great drama that contains a lot of smart comedy."

","Alejandro's riveting drama isn't just about a lost actor who is trying to find himself through a Broadway play but is also about a broken man trying to justify his relevance to the world. Birdman is an extremely well written dramatic account of Riggan's life, his tattered relationships, his dream to make it big once again and the alter-ego that literally rules over him. <br/><br/>Inarittu's direction is a beauty as he merges several frames subtly to project a continuous shot. The whole movie seems like it has been shot in a single take, and that illusion is worth an ovation. The director also gorgeously masters every frame's timing quotient. Every act starts with a proper follow through of a character only getting intercepted when it's someone else's queue. The flow and rhythm of the movie is simply splendid. <br/><br/>There is something beautiful about Birdman's story. The ploy is brilliantly narrated through the messed up head of Riggan with glimpses from his past debacles, screenplay that makes you brood that often cross over for emphasis, an ever ending take that goes on till the climax, and a conclusion that loosely dangles for intense interpretation. Everything has been wrapped up beautifully by an audacious and dark voice in his head, the one big thing he ever was – Birdman, one big success from the past that keeps haunting him, telling him he isn't dead and that he flies above the meaningless. <br/><br/>With an imaginary backdrop working along with the protagonist, you already know that you are in for a fantasy-world. What is crucial is that you pay attention. There are minute subtle hints that will blow your mind away while trying to connect the dots. <br/><br/>If we overlook the mind boggling ending for a while, still we are left with some exceptional drama pieces like when Sam speaks up to her father and shatters him with cold, when Riggan takes on a famous NYT critic in a bar and excellent conversations between Mike and Sam and Lesley's remorse. Things become intense owing to bits of psychotic drama as Riggan inches towards insanity. The climax of the movie leaves you spell bound and is deliberately left open for interpretation. <br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD:<br/><br/>If you have not seen the movie, please stop reading at once. But if you have, the ending is sure to raise doubts in your head. The flick ends in a surreal epilogue with Riggan jumping out of the window, and Sam reacting happily to her Father's 'flying' act. The one theory that I would like to believe but not stick to is Riggan's death after he shot himself during the theater act. Reasons that reassure me of this:<br/><br/>A. The plot was one continuous single take but the continuity breaks for the first time right after Riggan shoots himself. B. In the hospital when Jake switches on the TV it showed people lighting candles for him. You don't do that for a person who is alive. Du-uh dead! C. The hospital scene was probably the next day right after the incident. Sam bringing flowers for him could be at his funeral. This justified by his inability to smell them. His funeral again supported by the fact that her wife was wearing a black dress. Riggan jumping out of the window could be a symbolism of his soul transcending, as he finally rejects Birdman to be his only way to stardom. Sam's smile in the end could be her acceptance of her father's feat as a true hero.<br/><br/>What contrasts the above 'dead' theory greatly is the fact that there were several past failed suicidal endeavors by Riggan which have been subtly inserted into the screenplay. Lesley responding to Ralph once: ""He shot himself in the mouth. But he screwed that up, too."" The Jellyfish story goes on to show how Riggan was unsuccessful in killing himself in the past. So shooting the nose seems plausible. Then it takes us again to the hospital part. Taking this theory ahead on the vanguard, we can say that the imagination of Riggan once again begins right from the part he decides to take off the bandages and the rest that follows is once again the imagination bit. In the end he flew fantastically and figuratively with an acknowledgment sign from her daughter. This seals the deal too."

","Although I felt the plot was more original than most movies that have come out recently, I still felt it did drag out in some parts. There were a lot of hard to follow ""whisper fights"" that made the movie tense to an uncomfortable level at some points. I did really like the cinematography and set design of this movie though, the music was also a bonus, I admired it for the jazzy instrumental glow it gave to the movie. There needs to be more movies with instrumental soundtracks, it adds a certain charm to the scene it accompanies. One of the other things I really admired about the movie was the camera work, the angles were personal and intriguing, they gave me an almost dazed feel, I felt more absorbed into the world the movie created. But that may be just me, I'm a sucker for lighting, set design, and camera work. The ending (which I won't spoil for you) was better than I thought it would be. It was surprising and left just enough to be desired. The movie over all was good, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a more intellectual move, this doesn't seem to be something children could follow."

","As we dive deep into the mind of yet another conceited self-wallowing self-absorbed psychotic main character in this years winner for best picture, I find myself dumbfounded in what is considered art in todays society. Although I did enjoy the film it rattles me to the core what is considered a great film in the eyes of people in this generation. I sense a message coming from this movie that says todays big Hollywood hits, mainly comic book superhero films, are nothing more then big flashy expensive productions that is not real art, and does not represent good creativity in the movie making industry. At times to me it bathes in its own self-righteousness all while maintaining its central theme of suicide. I swear that this movie couldn't go ten minutes without referencing suicide in some way shape or form. At some points you actually start to believe that Keaton's character will abandon his selfish desires for the betterment of his families needs, but in the end chooses to end his own life in an attempt to show everyone that he is in fact ""somebody"" and not just a washed up Superhero actor. It even tries to convince us that in this act he is taking some sort of admirable approach to his dying career. Going out with a bang fashion. It upsets me that they mock films that inspire us to do good, and try to show us morals even when we doubt ourselves. Films that teach us real courage and sacrifice for the better of mankind, such as the Dark Knight trilogy, are considered less creative, and not deemed real art while films that teach us to ignore loved ones for selfish desires, and that suicide is a reasonable and honorable approach to failure are widely and critically acclaimed. My opinion of what true art is seeing something that you did not think was possible coming to life in front of your eyes. I get that from films such as the Avengers or Man of Steel. Those movies are the reason I go to the theater, to see something spectacular come to life that I have never seen before. This movie is nothing more to me then a carbon copy of all other films that show us the inside of a mentally unstable characters mind, and we get to witness his depressing fall into madness only to try to shock us and disgust us with what actions this madness makes them do. Making people try to guess what atrocious horrible action this character is going to next approach to film making is not art to me. It is my hope that great films like the ones Marvel studios puts out, and hopefully DC soon, will get the same recognition and awards that these films about crazy people doing crazy things do. Unfortunately I don't see this happening anytime soon. It was a good movie, but deserving Best Picture of the year I do not agree at all."

","Largely over rated movie, not lacking qualities, probably exceeded though. It's often funny, okay, poignant at times, absurd or even fantastic (poetic?) sometimes, but it's so heavy for a topic that deserves more lightness. This is the story of a challenge, a rebirth, a creative process for a has-been actor attempting to be recognized at last and for that matter the choice of Michael Keaton (whose Beetlejuice remains legendary to me) and the resonance with his own career is perfect. It's also a film about show business, where the strings, tricks, clichés and outbids are visible ad nauseam. As for staging theater, backdrop of the intrigue, the form of Birdman has a lot to do with its point. Except that it is abstruse. It is only a pretext for a series of burlesque scandals from each of the protagonists. Let me be clear, this is still a movie to watch: it's well done, the actors are excellent, there is rhythm and imagination in the waltz (perpetual sequence-shot) depicting these pathetic people, but everything is running round, it's heavy, insistent and in the end we do not care at all about their states of souls. In comparison, Birdman is closer to American Huslte or Synecdoche NY than Altman's or Cassavetes' movies, which I read Iñárritu's feature was compared to."
"gradyharp","7","0","4","23 February 2015"," The parts are greater than the sum
","Well, so the Academy awarded BIRDMAN Best Picture of the Year. Strange choice but perhaps it means that the Academy is taking a different look at Indie- type films instead of the all too huge glut of Marvel comics (though there are certainly elements of that in this movie – the main character does fly solo over NYC and moves objects with a flick of the wrist etc) and potty mouth dialogue (though there is considerable of that in this film, also) and rehab druggie overtones (though that too is part of the story). <br/><br/>The acting is very fine from the entire cast, the cinematography is interestingly claustrophobic in the St. James Theater (except for the sci-fi elements outside), and the story has some solid philosophical bits about family, parenting, hopes, dreams, delusions, etc. All good. <br/><br/>Much of the dialogue is buried in what has to be one of the most irritating soundtracks ever created. Individually the constant drumming bit is well done – if it weren't competing with the story or the dialogue. The excerpts from Mahler's Symphony No. 9 and the Rückert-Lieder excerpt 'Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen', Tchaikovsky's Symphony No 5, Rachmaninov's Symphony No. 2, John Adams' Prologue from 'The Death of Klinghoffer, and Ravel's Passacaille movement from his Piano Trio– all gorgeous and well performed by various groups – simply made no tangential sense, fought with the drumming, and again covered the dialogue.<br/><br/>But, this was an experimental movie and as such was a breath of fresh air to be even considered for an Oscar. As for the participants, Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough, Zach Galifianakis, Natalie Gold, and Merritt Wever and, of course, writer/director Alejandro G. Iñárritu all are in top form. Maybe on the big screen it doesn't appear so dissociative."

","It was annoying to see a movie about GENUINE actors' emotions, problems, and mental states, but know it was all scripted and presumably made up.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it was a tour de force to script and perform such a multi-layered piece. The actors are playing other actors, with (presumably) fake relationships and feelings for other actors (who they know in real life), in the middle of a play and 'real-life' drama. And their characters (such as ""Riggan Thompson"") are playing other characters in a play, which intersects oddly with their 'real' (fake) characters' lives and problems. On top of all this, the main character appears to be losing touch with reality and hallucinating *part* of the time, so everything is suspect and we don't know if there's another magical realism level, but the ending implies there is some real magic.<br/><br/>The title is funny -- Keaton was Batman, but never played either Birdman, but I'm sure DC Comics doesn't want questions about whether this is canon for their Batman character...<br/><br/>I wish I knew whether any of the relationships they portray between characters are based on real life relationships between Keaton/Norton or other actors, or made up of whole cloth. Perhaps in 10-20 years IMDb will have good data and anecdotes on this.<br/><br/>And I have to give Keaton credit for playing an over-the-hill actor who's losing it. Some points for bravery there."
"CMTiago","7","0","5","21 February 2015"," Beautifully shot, complex story
","Upon watching Birdman I was left with a sense of bedazzlement. The movie features great performances with characters that are a reflection of the real world. The long takes by Iñárittu are wonderfully executed and exceptionally supported by great lighting and a competent cinematography. Still the whole experience felt somewhat underwhelming.<br/><br/>To summarize, this movie is about Riggan Thomson, a man famous for portraying Birdman, a comic book superhero. Now he is trying to shed this association as he attempts to make it big on Broadway with an adaptation he writes, directs and stars in. Keaton was off course a perfect choice given his background as Batman in the late80's/early 90's. I feel that this movie expertly satirizes the pop culture aspects of today in a way that doesn't offend. Since I am as much a fan of this type of movie as I am of the blockbuster, I can relate to that. While Riggan is the main focus, characters like Mike, Lesley and Sam all offer their version of a real life person. Norton's Mike is a mockery of the method actor that seems to over accentuate everything when it comes to their art. Stone's Sam is the typical messed up daughter of a once famous actor and to a lesser degree, Watts's Lesley is that actress that doesn't know what happened to her ambitions as a performer. I do admit that last one isn't that apparent. All in all, these three and other main cast members do a stunning job.<br/><br/>Birdman is a movie that did seem to wanna say something about the current world. It's problems along with how people from a different time are adapting and coping with themselves. Still the message fails to fully come across, at least for me. However I still applaud what is an otherwise well made film.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

","I really had a fun two hours watching this film. It was brilliantly crafted, and some of the dialogue was classic. However, I cannot consider this film a masterpiece simply for its witty dialogue or its technical and artistic merits alone. <br/><br/>Sadly, Birdman: the unexpected virtue of ignorance lacked deep characters. Keaton's plight never made them worthy of any emotional involvement on my part. The thing is...that the jokes didn't match the tone of the cast's acting because the performances were realistic. If this film had a slap- stick element to it, then it would've worked a bit better for this story.<br/><br/>I do believe this film should win awards for the directorial effort and writing but as for Keaton--well, he wasn't bad at all, but he was out- staged by Ed Norton--who was fantastic in this film! I know this film will win plenty of statues this coming Sunday, but perhaps it deserves only a couple. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, its worth a rent.

","Birdman is like no movie I've ever seen before. Way to go Michael Keaton! If you ever watch this movie be prepared to see the revival of Keaton. This is a man who has been hidden behind other characters for several years in movies like The Other Guys and Robocop. Now he is the center of attention and the performance is so good it earned him a Oscar nomination. Keaton also already played Batman and he has become the forgotten Batman thanks to the new Dark Knight trilogy. That only makes his Birdman role more appropriate. I would be completely happy with Michael Keaton winning the Best Actor Oscar this year and it is well earned. There are some other great performances on here from Edward Norton who really surprised me for the first half of the movie and Emma Stone who really shows that she can take on a dramatic role. The filming was also unique and designed so it looked like the entire film was shot in just one take. You would be following characters around when they traveled through hallways and it was just a different way to see a movie. I will likely only see Birdman once, but I am still glad I watched it.

"jean-ximana","7","0","5","9 February 2015"," Notes addressed for those who watched: ""Birdman""
","Beginning by what the film has plainly to tell us (what's to say: by some quotes):<br/><br/>""Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige"";<br/><br/>""The unexpected virtue of ignorance"";<br/><br/>""A thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing"";<br/><br/>""Truth is always more interesting"";<br/><br/>Let's treat ""birdman"" as a clay concept that we can manage its meaning along the text. <br/><br/>So, a first consideration: ""birdman"" is about being OVER society, like flying over it, or is about been OUT OF society, as it was possible to be away from what society produces in terms of concepts, expectations, responsibilities, consuming behaviors, etc? <br/><br/>Now, does a ""birdman"" still a man, although half man/half bird? Or the fusion mischaracterizes both the concept of ""man"" and ""bird"" in a way that ""birdman"" doesn't keep any correspondence with the two others? <br/><br/>When we get to this considerations, it automatically comes to mind the following: ""birdman"" as a hollywoodean character is something far different from Riggan-the-actor? Does the stage and the behind-spotlights share anything in common? Real life and its opposite — whatever it may imply — shares anything in common?<br/><br/>The unjustified search of fame, socially described as an indicator of a successful career, are more likely to refer to a ""birdman"" OVER society, meaning that the efforts by Riggan of getting the critique and also the general acclaim with his play go all in the intention of separate him of the normal people and the normal life, get him — once again, and who watched will understand — in the spot regardless of the play. Continuing, all go in the intention of transforming him in some ""idol"" that stands over society, but logically demands its existence, even better if all of its attention points to the idol — than comes to stage the social medias, the cultural industry and so on. <br/><br/>However, if ""the popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige"", in what the search for fame differs from the search for making an oeuvre d'art? Woudn't this two have the same roots, if we agree with the fact that the ""real"" artist searches recognition for the posterity (prestige?), searches for being an idol as well? And the ""real"" qualifier is a trick here 'cause the one-take- that-goes-beyond-days film is always joking with our conceptions of ""real"" and ""unreal"", ""truth"" and ""lie"", ""play"" and ""reality"", mixing and confounding it all, in an exercise of dialectics.<br/><br/>And that ""remember note"" in Riggan's mirror which says ""a thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing"" could be a provocation: who would be able to say what is and what is not art? What is worth of been played at Broadway — doubtless an idol in our society — and what is not? Maybe no one and, at the same time, we all. Because ""art"" is ""art"" and not what we say about it, we should trace the path to its ""truth"", its ""essence"" in order to state what it is, but this task is so contaminated and determined by the social language we were taught to speak that we could never reach any ""truth"" of anything, as it doesn't actually exist, as ""real"" and ""unreal"", ""truth"" and ""lie"", ""play"" and ""reality"", again, was really different perspectives of seen things — like a method of looking to world and describing it — and not just some mess up of the director (Riggan or Inirratu?). <br/><br/>So, we are all allowed to build our parameters of ""truth"". And ""truth is always more interesting"" right because it ins't something solid and fixed, but fluid — as the film is, thanks to the production's techniques choices — and dialectical. <br/><br/>And this is how ""the unexpected virtue of ignorance"" could be meaning: different from what our traditional philosophical standards says, we could revolutionize all the constellation of concepts socially built and that are all around us, determining us all the time; we could give any sense to any word according to our will — we could give a scientific status to ""ignorance"", crystallizing it as a virtue. Cultural industry — Hollywood, Broadway ... — has been always creating meanings and idols according to is own purposes. We could create our own world too, maybe even against what is given to us already built up and maybe this act would be an ""real"" act of ""art"" from somebody's perspective. <br/><br/>Lastly, maybe the ""birdman"" that stands inside us and that is quite opposite to all this media things and fame and so on, is that one flying OUT OF society, society in terms of a bunch of concepts, the source of a language the allows us to communicate within objective symbols, a language sometimes oppressive and despotic which works to the establishment (Foucault?), but flying out to an another society — or, more precisely, an another language — in which even some physical laws are reinterpreted — as the theater does —, in which even some reactions are reinterpreted — to which Emma's smile at the last act of the film is so expressive of (relief, happiness ...?)."
"vsks","7","0","5","9 February 2015"," Acting 10 - Script 8 - Story 6
","Given this movie's underlying premise, I should say up-front that I have a love-not-love relationship with it. Yes, the acting is terrific. Given a script with substance, Michael Keaton, Ed Norton (truly amazing), and Emma Stone all received Oscar nods. I'm also big fan of Amy Ryan, who plays Keaton's wife in one of her trademark low-key performances, of the kind she perfected in The Wire. The story itself, however, of a middle-aged man's struggle to find himself amidst the debris of his messy family affairs and dwindling career is, for me, less interesting. In telling it, Mexican director Alejandro G. Iñárritu pays homage to magical realism of the South American kind (an armful of calla lilies appears on a monument somewhere to Gabriel García Márquez at every showing of this movie). What appears to be happening on the screen—Michael Keaton levitating in the lotus position or, yes, flying—can be accepted on either a literal or a metaphorical basis, or both, depending on the viewer's taste and tolerance. In the story, Keaton is a Hollywood has-been (a former superhero called Birdman) tackling Broadway for the first time, directing and starring in a production of the Raymond Carver short story, ""What we talk about when we talk about love."" The play is in rehearsal, and whether it will be successful is a toss-up. It looks unlikely. Meanwhile, Birdman himself keeps appearing like a nudgy pal, alternately flattering and browbeating Keaton and trying to lure him back into the gloriously popular action movies of his youth. The Carver story recounts an alcohol-soaked evening when two couples try to sort out what love is, a question that has baffled sober people from time immemorial. Because of his own extreme vision of love, the ex-husband of one of the characters shot himself but ""bungled it,"" says the play. Later, he died. This might be a clue to the movie's unwinding or not, because the extent to which the play-in-production is supposed to illuminate the movie is deliberately ambiguous. (I didn't understand the subtitle, either, as it seemed to me that the characters were all too knowing.) Numerous possible explanations (waking dreams, fevered thoughts, daydreams) could explain some of the action—especially the Michael Keaton character's flying—which if you're not overly hung up on trying to explain it rationally is thrilling. This is a movie that you have to decide to ""just go with it"" or face frustration. But the acting—and the bird costume!—is worth the price of admission."

","I think that people writing negative reviews got mislead by the trailer. I had some false hopes myself and expected a drama in CGI environment, yet eventually i've seen a great movie. <br/><br/>Birdman is a psychological portrait of a strained actor whose mainstream career took a turn twenty years before the events portrayed in the movie. This parallel with real-life situation of Michael Keaton and his reluctance to stay on board the Batman franchise in 1990s was a nice touch.<br/><br/>In the given environment Alejandro G. Iñárritu has some surprisingly positive moments and didn't only intend to drag us through the shards of main character's life. His state of mind dictated the tempo and came across in a convincing pseudo single shot, a long take that stretched across the whole movie. The soundtrack, consisting mostly of jazz improvisation, underlines the strain to which our hero has been exposed.<br/><br/>If you like theater, then Birdman might be interesting for you. It actually is a theater piece brought to screen and mocks the industry and the media surrounding it.

So, while leaving on the sunset of his career, he plays an all-in set to gain back the lost glory and pride as a theatrical actor, when he was acting Birdman at his early age. The movie is a quick snick look into an actor's soul (Riggan). An person who lived in fame and would prefer ""die hard"" on stage rather sleeping in his corner. What really surprise is director's talent to shot the movie in a such short time (2 months shooting). However, a quick parallelism came into my mind, with Mickey Rourke's playing (The wrestler).

In spite of that, I was surprised that this did not get much of that kind of police-work, and I say that in a good way, since I was left marvelling at the inconsistency of it all.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed, other than Zach Galifianakis and Michael Keaton bickering on- screen, of course, was the aspect ratio, which, though consistent for the helmer, is one of the most disappointing aspect ratios ever - 1.85:1. I thought I was gonna have my work cut out to sit through this one without continually dwelling on that disappointment.<br/><br/>Well, that was not to be, because this is one of the most exhilarating experiences one can have at the cinema. In hindsight though, I did feel that all of this was done for effect, and though the lead (Keaton) strives in giving this his all, it seemed to me, that he always knew that we were in there with him, and save for a few sequences (esp. one in which he speaks of theater criticism, as one who, albeit self-purportedly, some might feel, knows about the process and is disappointed in reading that it has come to naught - quite insightful actually, IMO), and his being safe in that knowledge was somehow off-putting to me. The whole flick being self-referential, kinda auto-biographically, was also something that put me off substantially.<br/><br/>Which is quite surprising, really, since I was able to look beyond that enjoy the flick anyway, since the quality of the writing and the setups in the well-structured screenplay, augmented by perhaps the greatest efforts ever put to screen by one of the best ensembles cast in their respective roles.<br/><br/>One sequence in which the actress playing the lead's child berates him for something clichéd, and yet makes the scene his/her own, with the tables turning over the defending character's head, was one of the best.<br/><br/>The scene where the lead lambasts a theater critic was interesting for multiple reasons, not just for his insights while doing so, but also if one juxtaposed that interaction against another interaction that the same critic has with another lead in the flick.<br/><br/>The ingenious use of the 'Batman Begins' voice in the lead's head, which, to me, also called out one of the most reviled (as well as revered, perhaps in larger circles) aspects of Bale's Batman. To me, it was his way of criticising the Nolan-Bale canon, and since I'm in the same corner, it appealed to me immensely.<br/><br/>Btw, some might feel that this one has an ingeniously ambiguous ending. I'm not of the same opinion. It's entirely obvious, and those who can't see that, well, I don't sympathize. Painfully (ouch) obvious.<br/><br/>The one take gimmick also did not work for me, especially since there were transitions that could have been worked with CGI, and it does not span one night, as I'd originally thought. I should not have read those pieces that dwelled on that aspect, since that led to different expectations in my head, and the end result was a downer, from that perspective.<br/><br/>Of all the cast, I thought Andrea Riseborough did not get much to do (except for, ahem, something I though the scissor-happy ones might excise but did not, surprisingly, though I say so myself), but I might be wrong since I did not watch the entire flick. <br/><br/>Keaton owns this, but IMO, does not deserve to win an Oscar, not just due to the points listed above, but also due to the fact that, to me, he seemed curiously disengaged from it all, while being aware of being watched (as indicated above). That, to me, is some pretentious stuff, and I don't feel it should be recognised at all. But there will be those who says that breaking the 4th wall by any actor is also a difficult task, and perhaps Keaton deserves to be recognised for that effort. Let the chips fall where they may.<br/><br/>All in all, worth multiple viewings at the cinema, and I'll be headed to one of those 'plexes with the once again this week, but in my case, just to catch those 40 minutes I missed."

","After watching this film was puzzled why did they nominated it for so many Oscars. I mean this has some really excellent parts, but overall is not that outstanding achievement everyone is trying to portray it to be. At least I think that way. I am sure there are a lot of people who will disagree with me, but for the Oscar race in Anno Domini 2015, I would definitely opt for Boyhood rather then this film. Boyhood is far, far, far better film then this one.<br/><br/>As far as this film goes, acting is excellent, plot is an interesting insight into Broadway. When I lived in NYC I went to watch Broadway plays a lot and I am glad they made a film which gives an insight into Broadway world. Very interesting.

"texshelters","6","0","5","28 January 2015"," Birdman: A Smart Movie with a Stupid Ending
","There is a movie making the rounds of the award shows about an actor who was last widely known for playing a famous superhero in tights. He is attempting a comeback doing something artsy, not unlike Michael Keaton in Birdman. Because it's self-reflexive, it must be FABULOUS! Well, not so much. But it is usually smart and oft entertaining. Like a piece of lesser-known theater, it has its moments. <br/><br/>There are some things that are fabulous in Birdman. First, the bits of magical realism throughout the film work quite well, until the ending. Second, there is Ed Norton chewing up the scenery with controlled, skillful over-acting. And last on the list of the fabulous is the jazz drumming that follows the actors as they wind their way through the maze of rooms: dressing, make-up, costumes, and through the stage rigging, the lights and other tools of the trade found backstage at a Broadway theater. <br/><br/>The other acting is as good as its script allows. Emma Stone is fun as Sam, Riggan's (Birdman) daughter, but her petulance becomes irksome after awhile. We fail to see one moment of genuine emotion from the character, even when showing her concern for her father. Her father, Riggan, is played adequately by Michael Keaton, but the famous actor down-on-his- luck schtick is tiresome. Riggan takes himself so seriously that he is a bore. Somehow, I believe that was NOT the intent of the director/writer Iñárritu. <br/><br/>Naomi Watts is adequate, but her character's lines about trying to ""make it on Broadway"" were repeated too many times for me to care. It wasn't so much her acting that annoyed me, her hackneyed and out of place dialogue. If she improvised them, well, then it was her acting. <br/><br/>Zach Galifianakis was surprisingly not the most annoying one in the movie this time. He plays the straight man, the producer of the play, to counterbalance all the lunacy of the actors. He keeps it together and does a fine job. <br/><br/>Iñárritu is making an artistic comeback himself as the writer and director of ""Birdman"", not receiving this much acclaim since his first feature, ""Amores Perros"", a much more compelling drama. ""Birdman"" is interesting and clever with all its metaphor and fantasy. The problem is that Iñárritu could not get away from magical realism long enough to make a coherent ending. And as we all know, a terrible ending can turn a good film into a mediocre film. That, unfortunately, is what happens to ""Birdman."" It's treatment is so unusual, but its theme of a washout actor making a comeback so worn out, that a cogent ending was needed to make it work. <br/><br/>The camera work and editing are excellent, as are the sets. The script is at times brilliant and at other moments, mundane. Another run-through by actors and other writers may have brought some needed realism to the magic on the screen. As far as New York goes, the city plays its part well, as always. <br/><br/>Rating: Matinée<br/><br/>It's fair, but for a better, harder hitting film featuring a washed-out actor, rent ""Sunset Boulevard.""<br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters"
"Al_The_Strange","8","0","6","27 January 2015"," What We Talk About When We Talk About Art
","Movies. They're so fake. So shallow and pointless. All style and no substance. Pretentious. And the people who make them...are they truly artists, or nothing more than a group of rich, snobby, spoiled hacks? In today's world of Michael Bay movies, viral videos, and reality TV, it would seem that the art of film, and the art of acting and performances, is often drowned out in pure pop-culture noise and trash.<br/><br/>These are a few of the main points made by Birdman, the humble story of an aging actor with a dream to become an accomplished actor on Broadway. After a career built entirely on a popular superhero, the man endures the ongoing struggle of his ego, with part of him wanting to fall back on his fame and fortune, and the other half wanting to strive for genuine artistic merit. Surrounded by various other characters at different ends of the spectrum, he's thrust into a downward spiral of madness.<br/><br/>As you can see, it's an interesting story with some meaty themes worth exploring. The experience of watching this story can be pretty rewarding; it maintains a darkly humorous tone throughout, with plenty of sharp dialogue. There are a few moments where the character's mental state induces weird scenes where he's flying like the titular Birdman. For the most part though, this is a straightforward dramedy that hinges entirely on the execution of its plot and characters. On those merits alone, I'd say it's an interesting and thought-provoking story worth seeing.<br/><br/>As far as the style goes, the cinematography is the film's most impressive asset. Much like Rope and Enter the Void, the vast majority of the film transits from scene to scene seamlessly, with hardly any cuts up until the end. It gives the film a very even flow, and it is especially smooth how the camera steadily tracks all the action and characters down narrow hallways and crowded streets, the way Kubrick's films often did. Acting is another great asset in this film. Every character in this film is somewhat unhinged; Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, and every other actor is effectively perfect. The script is really sharp and poignant, although some dialogue can be rather raunchy. This production uses stylish and real-looking sets, props, and costumes. The few special effects used are neat. Music consists mostly of drums, and I loved it.<br/><br/>This is a good-looking film with an interesting story that's told really well. That in itself makes it worth seeing at least once.<br/><br/>4/5 (Experience: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)"

","I agree with many reviewers that it deserves a 10 for figuring out the impossible logistics of the ultra extended single shot. Gimmicky, yes, but it works. Chapeau to all involved in figuring it out. In the end however, it comes down to being engaged in a story that moves you. I admire that G. In/arritu takes risks (by the way why'd he change his name from Gonzalez In/arritu to just G. In/arritu? What's wrong with Gonzalez? Sounds like his Hollywood agent had a talk with him), but the risks he takes seem too 'Rebuscados' - trying too hard to be cool, different, smart, innovative, meta. Michael Keaton? OK, he's playing a washed up superhero actor who's trying to find meaning again. But it would have worked better if he'd played himself - the superhero should have been Batman not Birdman. I love Emma Stone but that monologue? Rebuscado. Not her fault. It was the writing/directing. Cut the monologue and she deserves the Oscar."

","BIRDMAN- or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance At its heart this is the story of a man who strives to be loved by his family and others, goes about achieving love in an extraordinarily wrong and difficult way, and miraculously achieves love at the end in spite of his confused ego driven way. The film is an interpretation of Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.<br/><br/>Birdman is a 21st century surrealist film, and undoubtedly the most successful film in that genre of all time. Successful in that going into the movie, if you aren't the academic type or even know what surrealism is you will understand and will be supremely entertained by the concept.<br/><br/>""A thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing"" reads a sign in Rigan's dressing room- so my very review of it, like the play critic's review in the film, becomes yet another layer to the film. Super-realism, hell yehl! Another layer: Michael Keaton, an actor who in real life has not graced the Silver screen for a while, plays Rigan an actor who is past his heyday and trying to make a comeback after being out of work for a while. The casting of the movie becomes yet another layer and what a brilliant layer it is. Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Andrea Riseborough, Naomi Watts, Edward Norton, and Zach Galifianakis work together so seamlessly; there should be an Ensemble Oscar.<br/><br/>The cinematography of Alexander Dinelaris along with the script of Nicolas Gicobone under the direction of Inarritu create a fast paced mental dance that you will not have time to reflect upon until you are outside the theater. It is a film to be experienced, preferably on the big screen.<br/><br/>In the Inarritu/ Giacobone collaboration we have finally found the team capable of making Gabrielle Garcia Marquez's ""100 Years of Solitude"". I for one will never miss a film from this dynamic duo.<br/><br/>Should win Best Picture, Best Director, Cinematography and at least one Oscar for acting."

","The film is about an actor who's is popular because of some comic movies who made back in 1992 , and since then hi is then he is trying to make an ""artist"" name out of him playing in a Broadway theater. The casting is very clever because Michael Keaton is used ( an actor who played Batman in 1992, and except that role he is unknown to the public). This is very smart but not that original , since Darren Aronofsky has made the same thing in ""The Wrestler"" when he used Mickey Rourke to play a almost forgotten wrestler. If you see the movies you will realize lots of commons in the plot, the artwork etc, the symbolism etc The movie succeeds in make you emotional for the main character but I think that there is lots of wordy characters with problems quite irrelevant from the main plot.

","I will admit that this film kicked my ass, I read a lot of reviews before seeing it ensuring none of them gave away the story. I'm not sure though whether what I read misguided my imagination from what I actually seen or the film was so over hyped that what I eventually ended up watching didn't live up to the expectation as predicted. I ummed and ahhhed over re-watching the film before reviewing it again but in the end have decided watching it again would be unfair and to be an honest review I should write my first thoughts. Perhaps I'll write a second review sometime in the future, for now though I'm going with my original feelings and thoughts and penning that hopefully this review will leave make way for some great discussions.<br/><br/>Riggan Thompson sits in his dressing room mediating, he hovers about three feet off the ground legs folded and hands in a praying position. Riggan Thompson was once a great comic book turned movie hero to the film industry with a legion of fans, that was all back in the 1990's. Since leaving half way through the third and fourth films his career took a dive, these days he is a washed up almost forgotten actor so to make his way back to the hearts of his fans and create some new ones he decides he will write, direct and star in an adaption of a Raymond Carver story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"". The play is set to debut in the St James Theatre in New York, 24 hours before the first preview screening one the main actors is injured and can't do the play. He brings in a very well-known method actor Mike Shiner who has done more than enough to empress Riggan. During his first preview screening Shiner does the unthinkable and Riggan's world suddenly comes crashing down around him, his estranged relationship with his daughter gets father apart, his best friend turns on him and to top it all off a famous and reviewer has threatened to destroy the play no matter how good it actually is. With Riggan's ""birdman"" attacking him from the inside slowly Riggan's world becomes more than he can handle but what and how will he make this all work.<br/><br/>The first and last thing you will notice about this film is that of the amazing camera work, the entire film appears to be shot in one single take which is absolutely stunning to behold, fantastic idea by both the director Alejandro González Iñárritu (21 Grams, Babel) and his lead cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, the second thing you will notice is the brilliant acting by Michael Keaton (Batman, Beetlejuice) who plays Riggan Thompson, he is amazing in his role very believable you almost think that perhaps he isn't at all acting but being himself which must be the sign of a true genius, add to the amazing acting the stunning performance by Edward Norton (American History X, Fight Club) who plays Mike Shinner, I loved his character and thought he really helped the film where it would have otherwise fallen down. I found the story though very lack luster, almost boring, I personally believe it just tried too hard to be an art-house but failed, sure it had its moments and the camera work is more than enough to class this film as amazing, as is the acting from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, I felt it needed a lot more though to deserve all the acclaim it's so far received. Also in the cast is Zach Galifianakis as Jake, Emma Stone as Sam and Naomi Watts as Leslie.<br/><br/>Birdman is a film that needs your full undivided attention, I personally don't believe it will be for everyone, it is a very intellectual film (perhaps that's why I didn't enjoy it as much as everyone else) It's a film that will take you deep inside a man's mind and what makes him tick, it's a film that will wish for that little bit more and lastly I believe it's a film that lies to you especially if you have seen the trailer so don't expect no big budget action film as the trailer leads you to believe."

","This is a really well-executed rip off of a movie very few people have watched. Or had and forgotten. Surprised no one has brought this up before, but it has identical themes with identical characters and identical moments. The one thing we can say, is that it is an indictment on the life of Michael Douglas (Keaton) the same way it was about the indictment of Francois Truffaut.<br/><br/>I think it's a great steal though. And done well. It really put Keaton into the driver seat of both being an apologist for his career and executioner of the fan base that followed him through his Gotham days. IF his life interests you and his opinion of nerds who fell into the hole of Warner Bros. product, this movie will fascinate you. For the rest who care very little about a has-been superstar self-imploded spoiled actor, this will irritate you.<br/><br/>I liked it for the insight to how people like Keaton feel about us. And critics. Does it effect him...what the public says...yes. Does it guide his life...no. He's perfectly content on the lackluster career he's had since the cape crusader. Has he spent a lifetime proving to you that he isn't that guy anymore? I think so. I never thought he was that guy anyway. But...I find it odd that someone who turns to be beloved such as Jack Nicholson hurdled this stardom but someone who is in his head so much, like Keaton got buried under it.

A number of aspects of the movie, such as the cinematography, while interesting, are beyond my expertise. I sympathized with several of the characters who all seemed were treading the waters of their own internal conflict. For me more of a drama than a comedy.

The acting and the passion that these people showed in there desire to give the best performance possible was palpable. I was drawn into this world and became concerned with these peoples lives.<br/><br/>Edward Norton's portrayal of the self centered ego-maniacal actor who is a terrible person but a fantastic actor was complete in all ways. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton played the part of a has-been actor grabbing for glory and afraid of his own mortality in a manor that allowed me to believe that he was in fact Riggan Thomson.<br/><br/>The supporting cast all played their roles very well. However, Emma Stone as Sam Thomson was the least believable of the performances.<br/><br/>The view of the inside of Riggan's head was well done and brought to life the struggle he was having with his dying career and his inevitable death.<br/><br/>The 4 star rating comes from the last 20 minutes or so of the film. From the moment we see Riggan on the ledge of the building after having his dream crushed the movie becomes predictable. The only unpredictable part of the end was how long we were forced to sit and suffer. The flying scene that did not end in his death did not seem to be the same film I had been watching. The director seemed to have lacked a convincing way to end the movie and it showed. Each time you think the movie is over it just keeps going. After it keeps going it gets worse each time. Until finally at the end Sam looks out the window and looks up as if she can see her father flying like a Birdman. <br/><br/>This fantastic movie was ruined in less than 20 minutes.

","A passel of better than average performances - not excluding Edward Norton as a stereotype of the kind of ""method"" actor too undisciplined to be a real actor or survive two shows in the real commercial theatre (Dustin Hoffman pulled this off far more amusingly - and surprisingly, more BELIEVABLY in TOOTSIE!) are the chief glories of BIRDMAN. Top billed Michael Keaton goes Oscar fishing with a predictably against type depiction of aging insecurity, but ultimately the cast cannot overcome a script which is at best excellent imitation Mamet, at worst pretentious claptrap.<br/><br/>The film strives for artistic credibility - given the nine Oscar nominations, with some success - by Hitchcockian long tracking shots and self conscious close-ups (in part necessitated by the incorporation of the back stage areas of a Broadway house as the set and a kind of third lead) and commercial success by having its leading men in their under shorts or less as often as possible, but as back-stage drama or comedy (it tries to be somewhere in between when not flirting with attempts at soaring fantasy) it struck this viewer as one of the least successful yet put on film.<br/><br/>The Mexican writer/director Alejandro Inarritu and the fervent followers he has developed, should have a look at MEETING VENUS (1991), A DOUBLE LIFE (1947) or even, God help us, ALL ABOUT EVE (1950) to see how this sort of thing can actually be done with a sense of reality. It isn't just that the play under consideration pretends to open (as it might have 35 years ago) with less than a week of previews and no ""out-of-town"" tryouts, or that actors walk in the lobby of one theatre and into the auditorium of another (one of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie for a theatre person is the street views of the Broadway theatre district circa 2014 - including the homeless man's over-emoting a soliloquy from HAMLET at the start of Keaton's manic depressive hallucination which nearly saves the film) or its depiction of a hate filled Broadway critic which was dated when Cary Grant did it hilariously in ARSENIC AND OLD LACE (1944) or even the old Hollywood trope of an audience member chatting backstage in his dressing room with the lead of a show JUST before he has to make his final entrance in the last scene of the play on Opening Night! <br/><br/>Inarritu's model here seems to have been the bizarrely surreal BLACK SWAN (2010) - the first out-loud laugh at the performance I saw followed the most unfortunate parallel to the earlier film near the end. More power to them. If you liked that template (I loathed it), you will probably have a wonderful time at BIRDMAN.<br/><br/>One side note: that crack from the daughter about the source story for the play Keaton's character has written and stars in being ""50 years old"" is a JOKE typical of the film aimed at her immaturity! The story was first published 38 years ago in 1977. For those who were aware of Raymond Carver, his all too brief career (mainly in his last decade) ended with his death AT only 50 in 1980."

","Birdman is an odd film that succeeds largely on the basis of its performances. It follows the inner life of a washed up Hollywood actor, famous for playing the eponymous superhero, as he tries to do a Broadway adaption of the works of Raymond Chandler. Michael Keaton is great in the lead and has an excellent supporting cast, but the film comes across as too pretentious for its own good.<br/><br/>There is not enough praise in a small review for the performances in this film. Michael Keaton's work in the lead should cement a comeback and earn him an Academy Award nomination in the bargain. However, the true highlights of the cast are Edward Norton as an obnoxious co-star and Emma Stone as Keaton's troubled daughter. Both actors steal every scene they are in and deserve to win Oscars for their work. Norton embodies the ego-maniacal actor while still managing to keep his character likable, even after what is arguably an attempted rape. Stone conveys her character's vulnerability without making her pathetic. Zach Galifianakis also does well as Keaton's business partner.<br/><br/>The film also explores some very interesting themes, such as the relationship between filmmaking as art and the production of mindless blockbusters. There is also a thought-provoking discussion of film criticism and the attitudes critics bring to actors and their work. There are scenes that will make armchair critics (...cough) think before they trash a film or play someone has worked hard on.<br/><br/>However, Birdman is hampered by a pretentious atmosphere that undermines the appeal of the actors. The framing of the film as one continuous shot is distracting and comes across as showing off by the cinematographer. Furthermore, the more whimsical elements of the film feel out of place at times, occasionally leaving the viewer to wonder what is really happening and what is in Keaton's head. This is especially true at the conclusion. Still, the performances make the film worth watching."
