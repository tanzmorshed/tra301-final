","Don't Breathe: That rare modern horror film that uses tension building and atmosphere. With an unsettiling preformance from Stephan Lang and a totaly original story while being full of hitchcocking suspence and twists to create real modern horror, Don't Breathe is that rare modern horor film that succeds Intellectually as well as viscerally.
if you like horror it is a must watch!"
"lesleyharris30","8","39","52","26 September 2016"," Edge of your Seat Suspense,
","Don't Breath is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is an absolute thrill ride, from the moment we enter this man's house there is a tension that does not go away, it never becomes tiring. It had me at the edge of my seat from start to finish, as we quickly gain support for these thieves as they get caught up in a bad situation. <br/><br/>It did, on the other hand, make some cliché plot developments. There are some moments that were so typical they took me away from a movie that was clearly trying to stand out, but was clearly forced by the studio to have some predictable plot points. <br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal and their chemistry with one another added to the suspense. Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette were very believable as down on their luck teenagers. The star of the show, however, is without a doubt Stephen Lang, a completely engrossing performance of a ruthless man with no soul, I believe it will go down as the highlight of his career. <br/><br/>The intimacy of the film is the main thing that makes it so fresh and interesting as a thriller, if it was taking place around a city or in a town it would not be half as suspenseful as having it all take place in a house. An intense adventure, Don't Breathe is a refreshing movie that certainly stands out from the crowd, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good thriller. <br/><br/>A group of teenagers break in to a blind man's home in order to rob his possessions, however, they soon realise he is far smarter than they thought. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Stephen Lang"
"Scunner","Null","96","140","18 November 2017"," Morons vs a blind man.
","Three unlikable morons break into a blind man's house to steal his money. These are supposed to be the protagonists we're rooting for. Being morons they then proceed to alert the blind man to their presence whereupon said blind man disarms the most egregiously moronic of the three and dispatches him forthwith. At this stage the other two morons have ample opportunity to escape by breaking through the massive unbarred windows right next to where they are standing, but for plot reasons this doesn't occur to them. Neither does distracting the blind man by throwing any of the many objects located throughout the house, or indeed throwing them at him or simply hitting him with them. Because they're morons. And then some other moronic stuff happened before I decided life was too short to waste on moronic crap like this and turned it off before the end."
"moviewizguy","9","250","385","17 March 2016"," An incredibly intense thriller
","Fede Alvarez just gave Green Room a run for its money with Don't Breathe, an incredibly intense film and glorious exercise in suspense. It's one of the best studio-produced thrillers I've seen in years. The premise is simple: A group of teens plans to break into a blind man's house to steal his money. Only thing, the old man is more adept than they realize. While the setup is a little too pedestrian, albeit economical, once the story gets rolling, the film doesn't let up, running at a lean 88 minutes. Other than that, Don't Breathe is best viewed going in knowing as little as possible.<br/><br/>This is Alvarez's first film in three years since his violent and solid remake of Evil Dead, and it is with this sophomoric debut that solidifies the genre filmmaker as someone with obvious talent. Inspirations are drawn from the best - Hitchcock, Fincher, and Wait Until Dark are a few - but Alvarez provides his own unique vision that truly makes the film his own. Like the masters before him, Don't Breathe is purely cinematic, relying less on dialogue and more on visual storytelling and sound to drive the film. The cinematography is amazing as well as the creative sound design, so much so they are characters within the film themselves.<br/><br/>The cast, while small, is great too, including Jane Levy, who can pretty much be titled this generation's scream queen after this and Evil Dead. Dylan Minnette is good in his role as well, providing enough sympathy for his character. Both young actors are put through hell, and their physical performances sell their tumultuous ordeal convincingly. However, it is Stephen Lang who is the film's shining beacon. As the antagonist, Lang is instantly memorable and frightening, an intimidating force that permeates throughout the film even in scenes without his presence.<br/><br/>If there's one gripe about the film, there's a plot twist that doesn't quite work, but that itself is a minor complaint compared to the many things the film gets right and does so well. I won't say more. Don't Breathe is a technical achievement, the rare studio film that actually pushes what film can do as a medium. However, like with Green Room, try not to get caught up in the hype, even with my glowing review. Set your expectations appropriately, and remember to avoid watching the trailer."
"Quinoa1984","5","165","281","31 August 2016"," a film without strong follow-through on its premise
","Don't Breathe is a grisly, unpleasant exploitation film about characters that you don't like going up against a man who is at first somewhat sympathetic and then turns out to be a ridiculous mess of a (human) monster, and it's directed with some skill. I almost wish it had been made with greater sleaze or a total abandon for logic and taste and become a complete Grindhouse exercise, but the problem for me with the film is that director Fede Alvarez - again collaborating with Evil Dead producers Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert - wants to have it both ways, to have characters that, as the audience, you don't really like or have sympathy for so you don't have to worry *too* much once the psycho ex-military Zatoichi man is getting his payback... until he wants you to like them.<br/><br/>There's this sense in the movie that it's dancing with a grey area of having strong, morally ambiguous characterizations - you'll feel one way about the young woman Rocky and her compatriots Alex and ""Money"" (yeah, that's his name, like a thug on SVU or something), but maybe not everyone will feel that way until the peril and suspense and terror kicks in. That's fine, as well as it is with the antagonist (who, in the alternate movie that may exist of his story, he's the protagonist). But the problem is that the characters are set in a realistic horror-thriller situation and yet they carry that Dumb Movie Character logic that carries little logic at all.<br/><br/>This isn't the case for all of the film, and for the first half I was with it... up to a point. It's certainly got some logic gaps that you got to suspend disbelief for, and things like 'why if this blind ex-military man has all this money is he on the only house on a dilapidated Detroit city block with no one else living there, like out of Stephen King's Roadwork or something. And the filmmaker and his DP carry a lot of heft when it comes to the direction and the look of the film: they know how to bring an audience in by moving the camera in creative ways, having staging that makes sense, and pacing (in these early scenes) that makes things intense for us just as much as the characters... again, up to a point.<br/><br/>And then the movie decides to... well, here's where spoilers kick in: the guy (he doesn't have a name so Sgt Hartman-Zatoichi works well) is not simply some old dude living by his lonesome having lost a daughter to a fatal hit and run. No, he has his special set of I-can-kill-you-with-my-hands-or-my-guns, AND more than that is the reveal that in his basement there's a lair for the woman who hit his daughter who... he is also keeping locked up as she is knocked up with his child so that he can replace his dead daughter and... this comes into play even more terrifyingly in the last minutes when the girl Rocky gets in his grasp and... Jesus Christ movie! It's around here, or just before give or take around the moment when you think a character's been stabbed with a pair of gardening shears but it's revealed he is still alive(?!) (and this after seemingly to already be dead from a no-one-survives-that-s*** fall through a window), that the movie goes into Full Stupid and lazy territory. <br/><br/>Again, I wish that if Don't Breathe leaped into completely crazy and bonkers terrain, but it doesn't have the courage for that; it's caught in this nexus of trying to be a legitimately creepy and fearful experience done with direction that tries to sometimes call back to things like Fincher's Panic Room (also a 'bottle' one-location scenario), and being a movie with full on exploitation (the title recalls for me Edgar Wright's DON'T trailer from the actual Grindhouse experience), featuring characters we don't care about that are basically drawn (though with some real emotion from the actress playing Rocky) and thrown into nightmarish, violent set pieces.<br/><br/>I don't like when a filmmaker cheats me with information that's dealt out to me. I don't like having the rug pulled out from under me even if it's something that I should take for granted like a character survives something they shouldn't of or a character doesn't kill someone when they have ample opportunity to (you'll know the moment, or moments, when they come). I leave Don't Breathe feeling rather empty and angry instead of elated, which terrifying movies can do - see Green Room earlier this year, also about characters caught way in over their heads, for a much greater example of this - but its ugliness is in multiple ways: in how it treats rape and sexual assault (it ends up being a cheap out to having a stronger 2nd/3rd act), in how it treats bodily wounds (come on man), the logic of having a home security system at all if there's, you know, a RAPE DUNGEON in your basement, and how it treats sound design. Yes, for a movie like this the sound design gets weak after a while."
"Veteransson","7","57","92","12 January 2017"," Stephen Lang is perfect, the movie very suspenseful.
","Three burglars find out about a blind army vet, living in an abandoned street, sitting on a huge amount of cash. The three burglars break their rule of not stealing cash and decide to rob the place, thinking it would be a piece of cake. And of course it isn't. The blind army vet isn't as helpless as they had hoped for.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe is directed by Fede Alvarez, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Rodo Sayagues. They obviously felt inspired by David Fincher's Panic Room (2002), and did come up with a great, suspenseful movie. The three burglars are played by Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto, who all do a great job. Stephen Lang however outshines everyone in this movie as the old blind man. He doesn't say a lot but his gestures and mimics were enough to be uncomfortably creepy. Even though he played a blind guy, he still made his character seem anything but helpless, on the contrary, his character was more menacing than any ghost, monster or murderer from your average horror movie. On the other hand however, you feel sorry for the blind man. He's simply a man trying to protect his house from burglars. Or is there more behind this man? The movie does a good job making you wonder about whether the blind man has something to hide or not. The movie does a poorer job however with Daniel Zovatto's character, he's the typical character every horror movie has: the asshole that talks too much and doesn't care about anything or anyone.<br/><br/>Besides one or two cheap jump scares, the movie succeeded at maintaining a lingering suspense throughout the entire movie. Once the three burglars are inside the house, there won't be a moment that you'll feel at ease. This is an edge-of-your-seat kind of movie. The movie opens with a scene that obviously takes place later in the movie, which alerts you that until that scene, the burglars will never be safe, and heightens the suspense even more.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, the twists and turns in the story start to accumulate. Twists and turns in a story are great but not if there are too many, and not if these twist and turns are the ones you might expect from a horror movie. Throughout its course, the movie becomes more and more predictable. And this is where the suspense, although still being present, lessens. <br/><br/>'Don't Breathe' is a great horror movie, accessible for people who don't usually enjoy the genre. It has a great premise and is very suspenseful but becomes a bit too predictable over time."
"samslaydon","4","84","144","2 September 2016"," Decent thriller with too many plot holes
","I would certainly classify this as more of a thriller than a horror film. Horror films can get away with stretching the imagination more than most films and since this was more of a thriller, in my opinion, there were too many such ""stretches"". Some plot elements were adequately covered early in the film. For instance, Rocky wants the money so she can escape to the west coast...check. The antagonist can drag a person down the middle of the street because it was established via GoPro camera that there is no traffic in that neighborhood...check. He keeps the girl in the cellar to give birth to a new daughter...check. But the bad points outweigh the good...1 - Why is it assumed that the guy has a huge amount of cash in his house just because he got a settlement for his daughter's death? Oh, he's weird so he doesn't have a bank account? The cash in his home should have been based on a better premise. 2 - The guy is in the same room with two of the kids that break into his home and even passes by them in the hall, but can't smell them. However, he walks into the kitchen and discovers they're there by smelling their shoes...ridiculous. 3 - In most of the film the guy is feeling the walls and stumbling around the house as a blind person would normally have to, but he appears out of nowhere fairly quickly to corner the thieves...whatever. 4 - The guy has a person trapped in his basement, yet he has an alarm to trigger the police in case of a break-in...good Lord. 5 - Despite the lack of sterilization and proper obgyn attention, he impregnates this girl with a basting syringe and sperm he keeps in a basement fridge...come on. I could name more, but I'll stop there. Yeah...yeah...yeah, it wouldn't be a thriller without those elements, you say? Nonsense. These are implausible twisting of facts, yet most accept this as good, if not great, filmmaking. Please."
"imamonstre","1","152","271","31 December 2016"," The story makes no sense.
","How did this film (and I struggle to call it that) receive so many stars?! THAT is the real mystery here! The story centres around 3 kids who break into houses. Two are dating, and the third-wheel is a quasi-moral-objector who follows along because he thinks he's in love with the girl. The girl clearly strings him along, and her scumbag boyfriend even mentions this to the beta about how he needs to keep himself in the friendzone where his ""b*tch"" put him. Yes, that's how he refers to his girlfriend. There's a really pathetically hamfisted attempt at making us feel some sort of sympathy for this trailer trash princess.. because she has a crummy home life? Because her mom is rude and has a guy-friend staying with them and asks her to go buy a frozen pizza? Are our hearts supposed to bleed? This somehow makes it okay that this girl chooses to be in a relationship with a thug, while consciously stringing along a seemingly nice guy (in comparison) ... and it's okay that she chooses a life of breaking and entering instead of getting a fast food job (I'm from Detroit. Fast food restaurants still exist.) or something of the like? She looks down on her mom, but all we can see is her mom being a typical piece of foul-mouthed trailer trash sitting around on the couch. SHE is the one out there committing crimes.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to this nonsense story. They break into the house of a blind army vet. A rich girl ran over and killed his daughter and he settled with the family for a large sum of money. They decided (for whatever reason) that he kept this large sum of money in his home. In the middle of the hood. Okay. Clearly a logical assumption (based on NOTHING. seriously. they just decided he kept the money in his house and there's nothing that lead them to this belief. He's an amercian citizen and a vet and he wouldn't use a bank? oh okay.) They break in and scumbag boyfriend is the first to die. They all act like fumbling fools and somehow this blind as hell old guy WHO HAS NO IDEA WHEN THEY'RE STANDING INCHES AWAY FROM HIM can magically locate and harm/kill them.<br/><br/>So the friend-zoned beta ended up leaving, because he never wanted to do any of this anyway. But after he heard the gunshot he went back to save his trailer trash princess. Why? Who not immediately call the police? Why sneak back into the house? He sneaks back in and trailer trash princess is hiding in the closet. He tries to talk her into calling the cops but she says no because she saw where this old blind guy hid his fortune and she wants it all to herself.<br/><br/>They end up in the basement where they find that this guy has been keeping a hostage. The rich girl who ran over his daughter. Friend-zoned beta once again tries to talk the girl into calling the cops but she doesn't want to because she says ""ya but then we'll have to give back the money"" She has no morals. Yet he listens to her. He went back to save someone with no morals. I couldn't care less about this film anymore.<br/><br/>Old guy ends up killing the hostage, and beta. Trailer trash girl gets away with the money. I fast-forwaded at this point. She's in the airport ready to ""start a new life"" and sees on the news this guy is being wheeled away in an ambulance reporting that he shot and killed 2 intruders and thank god he's okay. Trailer trash girl doesn't care, naturally. Are we supposed to be happy for her? She's gonna go off and live her life and not tell the truth about what happened? What about rich girl's family? They never get to find out what happened to their kid? IMPORTANT THINGS THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE how did this blind guy get this rich girl into his home? how did he get her into the basement (it wasn't a proper staircase!!!!!!!!!!!) and get her tied up with all the lighting set up juuuuuuuuuuust right. How did a blind guy set up such a great little hostage space? AND LET'S GO BACK TO, HOW THE HELL DID AN OLD BLIND GUY GET THIS YOUNG GIRL INTO HIS HOME. HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GHETTO, HE'S BLIND. HE CAN'T DRIVE. HOW WAS HE ABLE TO KIDNAP THE RICH GIRL?????????? i can't get over that! hahaha it's so stupid! this movie is stupid. the story is stupid. the characters aren't likable. i don't know, i want my time back."
"miketantarelli","4","78","134","11 September 2016"," Blinded by stupidity
","I was so stoked to see this movie. All the horror websites I visit all said it was awesome, can't miss it, must see, best horror/suspense/thriller in years. Well I'll give them credit, it was suspenseful. But not because of the acting, or the plot, or the setting. It was suspenseful because you never knew what stupid thing the main characters were going to do next. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see the next mistake. This movie was a joke. I have never been so disappointed with a movie I was so excited to see. After the girl escaped the house and was pinned in the car by Cujo, you knew the Blind Man was going to get her again. I was amazed at how much trouble these three people had with an old blind man. It doesn't matter that it was in his environment. Who cares. It was an old blind man for gods sake. Once he killed the first guy all bets are off. You attack him. You find something heavy, wait around a corner, set him up by making a little noise and BAM!!! hit him in the head. Get what u came for, and leave. They made this guy seem like Daredevil and Rambo rolled into one, with a little bit of The People Under The Stairs thrown in there. I understand movies are not real life, they are stories. But this movie was about something that could happen. This could be a real life scenario. But there were just too many stupid moments to take it seriously. You knew this was all make believe. You knew it was fake, just a story, just another movie. It was just a movie, and not a very good one. If you want to get frustrated while watching something, then this is the movie for you. If that doesn't sound like your idea of a good time, to me it doesn't, I recommend skipping this flick. You're not missing anything, unlike if you watch it, because then you'll miss about 90 minutes of your life."
"avik-basu1889","8","71","122","18 December 2016"," A brilliant directed, riveting thriller !!!
","The central theme lying at the heart of 'Don't Breathe' is the sense of claustrophobia, a sense of being trapped/imprisoned. The director shows us a number of appropriate images like window bars, bars outside gates, prison like shadows being cast by Venetian blinds,etc. to drive home the theme. This theme resonates both in a literal sense with the kids being imprisoned in the house that they had planned to rob in the first place, as well as on a broader symbolic level because it is made clear that these youngsters aspire to break out of the 'prison' of life in a financially ailing Detroit and head for California. <br/><br/>This film at the heart of it is an exploitation film and certain details get revealed with the passage of time that in keeping with the genre of exploitation cinema, flirt with lack of realism and force you to suspend disbelief a bit. But what made it very easy for me to suspend disbelief and go along with the ride was Fede Alvarez's direction. Without his masterful directorial skills and storytelling, this film will not work, full stop. He elevates the film. The Giallo inspired visual texture that he uses with the red and green neon lights not just makes the film look vibrant, but also serves a thematic purpose. His camera is extremely active and he makes use of space in the interiors of the house skilfully. He uses extended long takes to raise the tension and his use of ambient noises and music is subtle and brilliant. The very first shot of the film itself is masterful in the way the camera moves from an overhead position gradually to a ground level one to reveal what's happening along with a gradual rise in the volume of the music. <br/><br/>Stephen Lang has to be admired for his performance. He brings a very raw, masculine physicality to his demeanour that truly makes him terrifying at times.<br/><br/>I think this is one of the best directed horror/thriller films I have seen for some time. It doesn't spend too much time in developing its characters. Both the sides in the conflict are not worth unconditional sympathy. The youngsters are low time criminals and the blind man is not someone worth sympathy either once certain details about his life and mental condition get revealed. I guess it was intentional on the director's part to stage the film with a degree of moral ambiguity where the viewer doesn't fully care for either of the two parties and in the end it works within the exploitation film framework. <br/><br/>To end, I'll say 'Don't Breathe' is a film that I would recommend more for the direction than for the script itself."
"a_glaysher","5","75","134","15 October 2016"," Very infuriating film to watch and extremely cliché
","I was looking forward to watching this film, but after the first 20 minutes or so, I found myself shouting at the screen because of the ridiculousness of it all. After the break in, and initially being HEARD by the blind guy, they spent half the time stood around like lemons and sneaking around. I must have counted 8 opportunity's for them to grab something and knock the guy<br/><br/>out, but did they, no. They proceeded to sneak around while be stalked by this guy who couldn't see. It took them until the last 15 minutes to actually find the brains to actually grab a weapon and hit him with it. It was so comically unrealistic that it ruined the rest of the film for me, because it actually got better half way through once they got caught. If you don't like unrealistic and cliché films I would recommend avoiding this one."
"daniel-halloran","5","52","91","17 September 2016"," Too many flaws.
","We thought the cinematography, casting and acting were exceptional, and worth seeing. The story, however, has too many flaws. The dog would have awakened the man and put him on guard. How on earth would a blind man track down, capture, and enslave in a block and tackle harness, the woman who killed his daughter in an accident? Without being seen? How could any man survive multiple brutal attacks, including several swinging sledge hammer blows to the head? The police would have identified the blood spatter DNA from both the captive woman and the escaped woman (Jane Levy), seen the block and tackle harness, and not simply closed the case as a blind hero successfully dealing with only two robbers; they would have pursued those leads, even in Mayberry! With a little more work on those issues, this could have been a real classic."

","I only gave this movie a 6 instead of a 5 because the first half has some fine set-pieces, and the use of interiors is pretty solid and engaging. Otherwise, I was heavily disappointed by this one. If this is the best horror movie in twenty years as the critics so claim, then that means horror is in a worse place than I could have ever imagined. Mediocrity should not be considered exceptional.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that the main characters are just plain unlikable and the filmmakers clearly want us to root for them, particularly Rocky. However, I found her motivation far too shallow and flimsy, and her willingness to steal from a poor old blind man (before she knows about the rape dungeon in his basement) just so she and her kid sister can get to California to be, well, not justifiable given what she does know.<br/><br/>This would not be a problem if DON'T BREATHE was content to be a sleazy, fast-paced shocker, but it wants our hearts too and I just could not get invested in these people. Either make this more morally ambiguous, or make both the thieves and the blind man awful. The film tries to have both and it just fails dramatically.<br/><br/>By the end, the movie is just a shallow series of haunted-house bumps in the night and I just wanted it over. Yes, it's paced well, the cinematography is impressive, but when I don't care about a single thing happening onscreen, then what's the point?"
"rafaytherman","10","157","303","28 August 2016"," Fede Alvarez puts on a masterclass on how to craft a suspenseful film
","Let's break it down, shall we?<br/><br/>What makes a thriller good? It's the suspense, the nail-biting, tense situations the film presents that have the audience at the edge of their seats at all times. And I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that this film delivers just that. Whenever you feel like the scene is over, and that you have some breathing room, BOOM! Fede drops the characters in a much worse predicament, with the excellent and diverse score by Roque Baños pounding in the background. The score of the film elevates each scene and as the film progresses, the movie raises the bar and ups the ante with each passing moment. Once the characters enter the house, the film always has you in a vice grip and never lets go. It makes you feel what the characters are feeling; their dread, their helplessness; and that is a testament to how great a director, Fede is.<br/><br/>Let's move on to the actors. So the main cast consists of Stephen Lang, Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette, and each of them nailed their role. Stephen Lang, sir, hats off to you. The man looks like a bad ass without even trying. That's just what Mr. Lang is, a bad ass. But his performance in this film was much more nuanced. You could see that he was a much more complex character. He showed vulnerability, sadness, anger, depression and hopelessness, all through facial expressions, as his role did not require extensive dialogue. He was the star of the film. But equally so was Jane Levy. Now if you're a huge fan of her, like me, you've probably seen Evil Dead and all three seasons of Suburgatory, and you already know that she's a very diverse actress. But in this film, she took her performance to another level. The dread in her eyes, the anguish, as well as the determination to do what she had to do in the film, all were portrayed so well through physical acting and body language, and the same could be said for Dylan Minette's performance. A+'s all around. <br/><br/>Overall, I can confidently say, this is the best film I've experienced in the cinema, this year. Give this film all the money you can. These people deserve it. Thank you to everyone involved, for this experience."
"ccrisss","1","63","116","1 September 2017"," Absolutely ANNOYING. An Insult to intellect & common sense
","I have never bothered to write a review for any movie (good or bad) until now.<br/><br/>I've watched some very artsy weird indie movies, and a lot more awful mainstream movies, but this one compelled me to react because of its UNDESERVED rating & glowing reviews! <br/><br/>I can't remember the last time a movie annoyed the hell out of me by its sheer stupidity. I am appalled at how it begs you to suspend disbelief, insulting your intelligence throughout, and offering no redeeming quality whatsoever. <br/><br/>I know it's ""just a movie"", we're asked to set aside logic and believe the unbelievable for the sake of enjoyment, BUT the stupidity made it difficult to enjoy. and the story is not even fantasy, sci-fi or anything supernatural to warrant extreme suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>This is just a BURGLARY OF THE MOST EPIC MORONIC PROPORTIONS it's almost a comedy. I would even count an alien invasion more realistic than this preposterous plot!<br/><br/>The movie revolved around the UTTER STUPIDITY of those 3 lowlifes. Don't get me started on the old blind man who seemed to be Daredevil gone mental (who turns on lights in his house he couldn't even see). He might actually be a mutant, that's how he managed to pull off everything. And of course they had to force in a disgusting scene just to bring some so-called twist to somehow salvage their horrible plot and lack of decent script, it's pathetic and desperate.<br/><br/>I hated ALL the characters, especially the dumb EVIL greedy gold-digging hypocritical woman who would sacrifice her soul and others for money. and she's supposed to be the protagonist?? what a joke. I wanted her to be tortured. There is NO ONE you could root for, no one you would want to stay alive, except maybe for the dog. Had the dog massacred the woman I would've been a tiny bit satisfied but no, the absurdity continued to its pathetic conclusion that had me wishing someone could've just dropped a bomb at the start and be done with them all.<br/><br/>This is not about some minor plot holes we can overlook. The whole thing, yes the WHOLE THING is so RIDICULOUS that try as you may to shut off your brain from protesting, it's just not possible, at least not for me."
"MrJoe1987","1","33","57","23 February 2017"," What's brown and sounds like a bell?
","Dung. Just to clarify, this movie is also brown and sounds like a bell. Before you fall for the reviews and dive nose-first into it, please try to understand a few things...<br/><br/>This is a film (a thriller film, apparently) that aims to portray the perpetrators of home invasions as God-fearing victims with pure motives, war veterans as insane, murderous rapists that hunt by scent and echolocation, and old blind men as reclusive, unhygienic, and insane.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple. Three degenerate young adults (well, two degenerate young adults and a rich boy; an aspiring degenerate young adult, I suppose) are having a good old time burgling people's houses to raise money to move to California. Right off the bat, it becomes impossible for a rational, thinking individual to sympathize, in any way, with these people. They are initially shown to not only be robbing a house but, also, vandalizing said house, with one of them either urinating or ejaculating on the kitchen floor. Hey! It's OK, though! The girl (Rocky) is shown to come from a broken home shortly after, so she is completely justified in everything she does, right? I suppose all of the rest of us who got the shaft in life and did something productive with ourselves took the easy way out, right? Anyway, their fence informs them that they should consider actually stealing money if they want to make more money than they would make fencing stolen goods. Wow. Who would have thought? Seriously, who would have thought?! So, they break into an ""Army vet's"" house because they get a tip that he was compensated years earlier for the death of his daughter by the family of the daft teenage girl that was apparently being daft like a daft teenage girl is daft when she hit the poor guy's daughter with her car and killed her.<br/><br/>As it turns out, the old guy is blind and, oddly enough, not very fond of having people break into his house. He proceeds to play a game of cat and mouse with the invaders, picking them off one by one, and then... I'm not even going to bother with how ridiculous it gets with the plot twist. I guess you'll just have see for yourself if you're intent on wasting your time.<br/><br/>Jumping to the end, the girl ends up getting away with something like 1 million dollars from the old guy's house; the same one that was begging God for help at one point; the same one who left the bodies of her partners to rot; the same one that did nothing for the girl in the basement (like I said, you'll have to see for yourself); this girl makes it to California to live it up with her daughter/little sister/who cares with absolutely no consequences.<br/><br/>Morale of the story? If you're a pretty female, it doesn't matter if you drove a man insane by carelessly slaughtering one of his family members with your car, it doesn't matter if you are selfishly robbing houses to sate your greed and avoid working to make a living. The fact is, you are always the victim, all the time, no matter what. Thanks for the insight, Hollywood. I've already finished writing it down on this piece of paper, and... **FLUSH**"

","After Evil Dead's well-made remake, a lot of us felt that Fede Alvarez was a director to watch. With Don't Breathe, he definitely became a director I'm very excited to see future projects from.<br/><br/>I admire his knack to generate tension. After the film kicks off, there is really no stopping. It became almost unbearable at the end, nearly reaching the point of overkill. When you have a thriller filled with so much tension throughout its running time, there's only so much you can do before you start yelling ""you gotta be kidding me"" at the screen.<br/><br/>The cinematography was beautiful and moody and the performances were fine, except maybe Jane Levy, who I felt was too wooden, making her character a little bit unlikable.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe was a solid effort and a great addition to the home invasion genre with a little twist."

Over and over the heroes, who really are scum, never get the idea to distract the blind guy by throwing something to the other side of the room. It never occurs to them to smash out a window and escape through it. It never occurs to them to trip the guy. It never occurs to them to pick up things to use as weapons, even though appropriate objects are lying all over the place and indeed are picked up by the blind guy.

Most of the time you can't see what is going on because the action mostly takes place in the dark. Oddly, the blind guy has enough dim lights on so that you can see people moving around but not enough to see anything clearly. Later, the blind guy turns off the lights, but why did he have them on in the first place? He's blind, so why spend the money on the electricity? Why does this routine 1920s-style small house have so many strange shafts, both vertical and horizontal? How did the blind guy kidnap the young woman who killed his daughter? How did he get all those mattresses and bondage equipment to build the cell? How did the blind guy get rid of the dead girl's body?

"mzaighamabbas","8","44","83","26 December 2016"," An Intense and Suspenseful Thriller
","Fede Alvarez does it again. The director of the renowned horror film ""Evil Dead,"" brings to you a piece of excellence that will have you hold your breath throughout this morality thriller – ""Don't Breathe."" It is an exquisite play that plays with the audience's integrity and the will to do the right thing while conveying the story in such a way that we feel helpless and uneasy the same way that the protagonists on screen do. <br/><br/>Alvarez made a lot of smart decisions in the making of this film and one of these decisions was choosing the right cast. He was really wise to reunite himself with the star of ""Evil Dead,"" Jane Levy, an actress who is fearless at any given situation, and he was even wiser to cast Stephen Lang, an astounding actor for decades, who brilliantly portrays quite a challenging role here. Alvarez and his team give a remarkable visual representation of the story just by the exquisite sense of geography throughout the film, keeping in mind almost the whole film is a one- setting implementation thriller. <br/><br/>Here is a short insight of the film and what you're going to expect. The story starts off with the audience getting to know the three protagonists of the film: Rocky (Levy), her boy friend Money (Daniel Zovatto), and wanna-be boyfriend, Alex (Dylan Minnette). These three teen crooks rob houses in the wealthy suburbs in Detroit for some easy cash, however Alex's dad manages a security company that gives them the access to most of the alarm systems installed in houses they plan to rob, which means a lot less of ""breaking"" in breaking & entering. Rocky lives in a dump with her innocent sister, corrupt mother, and her mother's formidable boyfriend. <br/><br/>Since we're discussing the insights on individual characters of the story, it would be the perfect time to point out one of the drawbacks to this film. The reason many horror films always feel incomplete is because they don't have a solid background story to build up to an intense climax; rather they're just a continuity of techniques to give a sense of fear to the audience. This is what distinguished ""Don't Breathe"" compared to the other horror films till this point. Even though Alvarez shed a good amount of light on Rocky, and the blind man (Lang) later on, he didn't give enough insight on Alex and Money and that's to the film's disadvantage since the audience was not able to fully understand the character traits that define that specific role. You could feel Alvarez was rushing to the ""good part"" of the story however the ""good part"" could have been better if he took time to give an understanding on these two protagonists. <br/><br/>Getting back to the gist of the film, the three teenagers are sick of quickie robberies so they hope for a better job that could possibly change their future and to their luck, Money uncovered an easy gig, which is to steal a good amount of money that sits in a safe in a blind veteran's house. With this money, Money and Rocky, along with her sister, plan to move away to California in hope for a better life. It seems like an easy job to rob a blind old man who lives alone with the access to his alarm system; what could go wrong? <br/><br/>As mentioned before, the integrity of the audience is at question throughout the film since you wouldn't opt for teenagers to rob a helpless blind old man. But is he that helpless? The low-level criminals underestimated the blind veteran and that resulted in a not very fruitful situation for Rocky, Alex, and Money. However the moral complexity takes a back seat after a significant plot twist towards the end of the story. Trying to refrain from any spoilers, let's just say that the blind old man is a definite villain for a very disturbing situation. <br/><br/>Overall this has been a great thriller that you will surely love to watch again and again without losing even a bit of interest every time you watch it. The battle of wills between the protagonists and the antagonists is the headline of the film and the wonderful cinematography creates a frightful atmosphere for the audience to get engaged in. The icing on the cake has to be the various plot twists here and there, which keep you wondering what would happen next and of course have you hold your breath."
"leiser18","3","52","101","5 September 2016"," Ridiculous Plot
","Don't Breathe is certainly no Hitchcock or even a Guillermo del Toro film. The plot is implausible and far-fetched. It started out okay, but then anyone who pays attention to details will notice its many flaws and goofs. Several of them have already been listed in the IMDb, but the biggest flaw, I think, is about the dog. When the trio first comes to the house, the dog is chained. They drug the dog and he slumbers in his dog house. Later, all of the sudden the dog is in the house. How did he get rid of the chain and how did he get into the house? No doggy door, bars on the window, etc. Towards the end of the movie, when the girl traps the dog in her car and tries to escape, the blind guy catches her and drags her by the hair back to the house. He leaves his dog behind in the car? Obviously, the dog must have been barking. And when the girl finally does escape, there's no mentioning of the car or the dog. The other plot twist I had a problem with is that the blind guy kidnaps the woman that supposedly killed his daughter in a car accident, impregnates her and thus wanting to replace his dead child. It's ludicrous to think that a blind man could take of an infant. Even if the woman could have carried the child to term, how was she going to give birth with a blind man as a midwife, in a cellar? The only explanation for this part of the movie is that the blind guy was deranged. Oh, and yes, even though he was hit with a sledge hammer, he was hardly injured. I don't understand the big hype about this so-called thriller. To me it's a bunch of crap. If you want to waste your time and money, go see it and judge for yourself. You'd be better of watching a real thriller by Guillermo del Toro or one from the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock."

","OK, so this movie is at the top of my list for the worst movie ever made. A few movies have been on the list over the years, I do not imagine this one leaving the top spot for a long time.<br/><br/>The story is that three teenagers try to rob a blind man. That is pretty much it. Now here is why the movie was so absolutely awful. The story builds so that you are not supposed to be rooting for the blind man to kill and get rid of the the intruders, it victimized the criminals instead.<br/><br/>It made me so sick to watch these scenes of the criminals hiding in corners and being so afraid in this mans house with the mentality of ""oh my god, he is after us for breaking into his house and trying to rob him, what a psycho! We must do everything we can to stop and kill him!"". How can anyone expect me to want to root for criminals. I have had people try to break into my house and God help them if they ever do because there will be no remorse or mercy for anyone who did anything like in this movie.<br/><br/>So what do they try to do to the blind man you ask?...they pull a gun on him, shoot at him, smash him on the head with a hammer, attack him with a crowbar and drug him in his sleep...oh and they drug and tie up his dog. What sort of sick world do we live in where movies are released and you are watching young individuals beat up a blind man for over an hour. Seriously!? This is entertainment???<br/><br/>There is a scene where the main pathetic female criminal meets another criminal who has been locked up in the blind mans basement and says ""I don't care what you've done, I will get you out of here"" Which is hilarious because what could be worse then killing a blind mans child then robbing and trying to kill him after that...but the movie treats this blind character like some monster. Which is actually more offensive than any other part of the movie, why is an older blind person viewed as so gross and monstrous??? There was a movie recently about a pretty deaf woman being terrorized and I felt since the woman was beautiful that the average viewer had an easy time hoping she would survive and kill her attacker....but with this am I supposed to think...'well, he is old and blind, he has wrinkles so yeah, the young pretty intruder should kill him'.<br/><br/>The absolute worst movie I have seen. There is a scene where the blind man is going to inject his sperm into the main female attacker and she says'you monster!' or something along those lines. Some reviewers said this scene was gross...meh, it is a movie so I did not find it too gross, it is fictional and the main reason it is not gross is because... THEY ARE ROBBING A BLIND MAN! AFTER SOMEONE ELSE KILLED HIS DAUGHTER!!! WHO CARES IF HE TRIES TO RAPE ONE OF THEM...SERIOUSLY THEY SHOT A GUN AT HIM AND DRUGGED HIM, DRUGGED HIS DOG AND STOLE HIS DAUGHTERS MONEY!<br/><br/>Once his attempted semen injection fails they handcuff him to a wall and steal a million dollars from him. What exactly is the moral of the story. 'It is OK to steal from old blind people because well, they are old and gross and probably smell and we are young, so lets terrorize them and kill them because it is 2016 and like, home intruders are victims too ya know!.<br/><br/>ONE OUT OF TEN!"

"pin-kadi","1","24","44","17 September 2016"," Overview
","The movie opens with an old man dragging a young blond woman along the middle of a street. We are then introduced to 3 kids, Money, Alex, and girl named Rocky, who make a living out of robbing houses. While selling stolen goods, Money learns from a thug that an old blind man is sitting on 3,000$. With word out on the street, this money though happens to be waiting around to be stolen by these 3 kids. Money, Alex and Rocky decide to go ahead and steal the money. They manage to get inside the house and Money puts the old blind man to sleep using sleeping gas. After searching meticulously, the 3 decide the money had to be behind this locked basement door, so in order to open it Money fires a gun inside the man's house, expecting him to remain asleep, which obviously doesn't happen, and the old blind man ends up killing him with that gun while the rest are busy being afraid. This however does not prevent Rocky from getting her hands on the blind man's money which turns out to be around a million dollars that the blind man living alone with his dog had decided to keep in an old safe in an old house in an abandoned neighborhood. Alex and Rocky try to escape with the money through the basement but find a tied up girl that they free only to have her get shot by the blind man. This girl turns out to be the one whose family gave the blind man a million dollars in settlement for having her run over his daughter. She's also pregnant with his second daughter, because he wants a replacement. We later find out he had promised to give her back her freedom once she gives him the child (it would seem to the average viewer that he had not considered what would happen afterwards in case he did that). Back to Alex. He gets shot. Rocky is captured by the blind man and tied up to replace the dead girl as incubator. The blind man proceeds to heating up a container of his frozen semen to the perfect temperature being careful not to denature those sperms which he plans to inject her with (a process, believe it or not, he does not consider to be rape because he is not physically forcing himself on her) Rocky utters ""Please, God!"" to which the blind man responds, ""There's no God. What a joke. You tell me what God would allow this?  There's nothing man cannot do once he accepts that there is no God."" Unfortunately, we, as viewers, realize, hopefully, that Rocky's belief in God has not stopped her from trying to rob an old blind veteran, living alone, from the money he had gotten as settlement following the murder of his only daughter, and we also know that the most atrocious acts committed in the history of mankind relate one way or another to an intense belief in a deity, and that believing in superstition is in no way a condition for goodness of character. The movie finally ends after a moderate amount of more nonsense with Rocky taking off with the money and the old man not reporting anything stolen to the police who think he killed two kids in self defense. How he managed to get to dragging that girl to his house in the opening scene however remains a mystery to this day."

","Was looking forward to this ever since April/July this year & couldn't wait to see it. The story/concept sounded really interesting & looked as though it was going to be a pretty good film with a unique concept.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film just lost it's buzz & excited as soon as it began. The film concept is simple, 3 teens break into a blind mans home (he's an Ex War Veteran) & steel his compensation money. It seemed to be a good film & sounded it, but it didn't deliver in a way I thought it would. It kept me excited when I first heard about it but when it came to watching I wasn't as blown away by it. <br/><br/>I mean, don't get me wrong. The film was alright & had some suspenseful moments which kept you watching. It was creepy & had some jumpy moments in it. It also found it interesting to see what they could do with the concept of an Ex War Veteran who is blind & how he uses his military army skills to combat these intruders. As everyone would assume he's the vulnerable one & these 3 intruders have the upper hand, though we all know the film wants us to assume that. But know differently.<br/><br/>But anyway, it was poor & disappointing as it got to the end. I also found that none of the characters, not even the creepy jerk were likable or even redeeming. You couldn't feel sorry for the intruders because of their nasty heartless intentions (well 2 of the 3 as only 1 of them had a heart... slightly), & you certainly couldn't feel sorry for the War Veteran as he also had a dark nasty little secret down in his basement. So it was pretty difficult who to root for. <br/><br/>I also had problems with the continuity errors, like the dog disappearing & reappearing at random points. Also the plot holes, like the police not finding the DNA of the female intruder who shredded enough blood to fill a bucket & enough hair to cover a bald gits head! Unbelievable. <br/><br/>The female soul survivor ending was clichéd, cheap & just plain sexist! This is 2016 & these idiots still go for that? Hah! This is coming from someone who says the film doesn't reply on ""cheap scares"" oh the irony! So, she got away with the money, left her friends for dead & that poor old git get's robbed blind (pardon the pun) & doesn't say sh!t despite DNA evidence in the house that could place her at the scene of the crime! Layabouts like her expect to earn money by not getting a job, typical in this day & age!<br/><br/>The kills were tame & the blood lacked in certain areas, again another boner from the director saying his Evil Dead remake was too gory! Idiot, that's what we need! Films now have really gone down hill for slashers what happened to the days of SAW, Final Destination & Scream!? Not to mention Wrong Turn, Halloween, Friday 13th need I go on? Now everything has to be clever & smart & not straight forward! This film could've ended so much better had that git killed all those nobs!<br/><br/>The film did exactly what the first intentions of anyone's ignorant minds did. Blind man's home, has a ton load of £££. Should be easy money! Well it pretty much was when the film started & ended! Didn't have a twist ending where none of them lived or they got caught etc.<br/><br/>They pretty much did break in & take his money. I mean, it wasn't easy, aside from a few scuffles, nearly being forced upon by a squirter filled with old man's cream, getting shot repeatedly & assaulted brutally they got there in the end... just about!<br/><br/>But in a nut shell, that's exactly what she (they) did! Not a clever film it's hyped up to be! Watch The Strangers or The Purge! Least they deliver well unlike this poor disappointment.<br/><br/>4/10 Could've been SO much better!"

"Gresh854","7","27","52","30 August 2016"," Don't Breathe Is Not Only Extremely Intense, But It Also Sets An Example Of How Horror Movies Of Today Should Be Made
","I'm not the hugest horror movie buff, but when it comes to horror films like The Shining or Cabin In The Woods just know it increases my liking of the horror genre. Now rarely today will I find a horror film that I will extremely like or even like at all. It's almost now a 1/3 ratio were I'll actually go into a horror movie and find it to be a decent film. Don't Breathe not only expands a new level of intensity in horror or thriller films, but if it makes enough money it could inspire new waves of actually really good horror movies. Don't Breathe blew me away I was so immersed into this film that I almost felt like I was in the horrible situation that the characters in the film were in. There was so many times were I was on the edge of my seat and even sometimes holding in my own breath when the actors were holding their breaths. The premise of this film isn't very new it's kind of borrowed off of films like Panic Room but I think with horror films like The Conjuring, it's okay to borrow off cliché premises if the film itself is done right. The two main characters played by Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette have great character development. When a horror movie gives characters good development and likability it just makes the film way better. Cause now that I have these two characters that I actually care about it'll make me care about what will possibly happen too them throughout the runtime of the film. Now Stephen Lang's character I thought was very menacing as this Blind man. He had a great back story and he was a threat to be reckoned with. Also the way the camera focuses or moves around from scene to scene or place to place is done so well that it brings the intensity level to a more even pace. There's even a lot of long shots in this film that kept me on the edge of my seat. Now I do have one complaint with this film and that is about, no spoilers of course, the ending. The ending I think went on for too long it could've cut off at least 15 minutes earlier and the film would've been better. The film just kept dragging on and it felt unnecessary. Also just a heads up if you haven't yet seen the trailer for this film, I recommend not seeing it cause it actually spoils part of the movie. Other than that I had such an amazing time with Don't Breathe and if your a fan of the horror genre, definitely go into it and if you are interested in having a exciting experience at the movies go and see this film. This is easily one of my favorite films this year and I'm going to give Don't Breathe a grade of an A and a IMDb score of a 9/10."

Yes, he is off in his idea of revenge, but he measures his cruelty which is unlikely for thriller, isn't it? What is ""horror"" about it? Sheldon Cooper's problems were more ""horror"" than this. I think one reviewer here said it best: ""Don't Breathe is a grisly, unpleasant exploitation film about characters that you don't like going up against a man who is at first somewhat sympathetic and then turns out to be a ridiculous mess of a (human) monster, and it's directed with some skill."""

"tomholland2016","9","28","56","27 August 2016"," Edge-of-the-seat!
","The movie is not entirely a fresh novelty, the typical home invasion movie but what we don't know is that the inmate living in that house makes the concept different. The eccentric man and apparently blind pretty much turns the tables on three thieving teens in this thriller.<br/><br/>The movie starts off pretty slow, but it gives much space for the characters to develop their respective story. What makes this movie even greater is that Fede Alvarez, the director of the Evil Dead remake, delivers only 4 major characters on the screen if you don't count the feral dog. Overall, it has a strong plot and unique vibe to it, as it relies more on visual storytelling and sounds to drive the film rather than plenty of dialogue.<br/><br/>Once the three amateur thieves step inside the shadowy house, that's when it is fuelled by old-school suspense. It's very realistic from the moment they break into that blind man's house, asking from the perspective of how, why and what. The discreet environment can make someone's heart beating so fast. There are times where everything goes silent and it's incredible considering how the audience freezes and no one wants to make a single sound even when you're chewing popcorns. Not everything silent though, there are a few parts when the ominous music plays in the background, people just keep watching, waiting for something to be revealed. It's incredibly intense which literally leaves you breathless. The one thing I have in similar with this director is the cinematography. The way how the director angles the motion of every picture. It's very much like how I imagine it, the style of bringing the cameras with a very smooth touch especially 5 minutes after they break into the vicinity of the house.<br/><br/>Every movie has its black area, the thing that I feel a little over- the-top is the predictable moments, FOR SOMEONE WHO WATCHES A LOT OF MOVIE. It comes out a little too strong, but somehow it manages to capture my heart.<br/><br/>Stephen Lang once said throughout the filming process, he couldn't really see anything as he wore scleral contact lenses. How hard is it for someone to do that? You answer it for yourself.<br/><br/>This must be in my top 5 list movies of 2016. It is intriguing and the kind of movie you would want to stay at the edge-of-your-seat."

","*General spoilers*<br/><br/>I have to be that person and preface this by saying that I'm hardly ever squeamish about movie violence, sexual or otherwise. Just sticking to Sam Raimi's work, I was fine with Evil Dead and greatly enjoyed Spartacus, which seemed to have a rape scene every other episode. But those traded on something other than pure exploitation; Evil Dead had decent characters and was creative for its time, and Spartacus had drama and an at times moving story.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe makes the vaguest attempt at giving its characters, well, character traits: the girl has an extraordinarily cliché motivation that is handled very badly, and the longer-surviving boy is in love with her, so that's a thing? You don't have any reason to actually give a d*mn about the characters, so watching them suffer is about on the same level as watching an animal be tortured- -just pointless cruelty. The portrayal of the blind man is utterly ridiculous; he's bestial and inarticulate, adding to the movie's bizarre inhuman quality. When you get to the climactic confrontation between him and the female lead--I've never asked this before, but what kind of actor and actress would consent to play a scene like this? There's f-ed up, and then there's did-you-have- your-soul-replaced-with-dog-crap. No one in the theater was reacting well by this point. You can tell the difference between scared-but-thrilled and repelled and disgusted.<br/><br/>And then there's the fact that this movie is racist. Again, that's not a card that I play very often, but how are we supposed to interpret a portrayal of Detroit whose only black citizen is a sexist, dimwitted thief who exists to die within ten minutes? ""Black guy dies first"" is the oldest cliché in the book; HOW do movies keep doing it? They could have at least made him the slightly-cool one that doesn't deserve what happens, but nope; a single sympathetic character is too much to ask for, obviously.<br/><br/>As if all of the above weren't enough, the movie's ending dragged ON and ON, taking any suspense it had managed to achieve and running it into the ground. You don't want the audience's reaction to your jump scares to be ""oh, for f's sake"", but that's the tone I was getting from my fellow moviegoers as we toggled endlessly between man is back/dog is back/man is back/dog is back. I only stayed til the end because my roommate objected to walking out and wasting her money. I haven't seen anything this terrible in years, if not my whole life.

","I'm not the only reviewer on here to point out that if you want an audience to root for a character, you have to make that character likable. No one was worth cheering for in this. The three teenagers were scum. They broke into people's home, ejaculated on their beds, broke their precious items, robbed them, tried on their clothes and generally, probably, ruined their lives. There was a feeble attempt to make one of them more likable--oh, she has a little sister she's trying to protect. Big deal. Didn't work for me. I kept hoping she'd die. Unfortunately, the character who should have been the hero, the blind veteran, was such a mess of inarticulate grunting and weird, utterly unlikely abilities that I couldn't cheer for him either. I tried rooting for the dog, who really didn't deserve to be drugged and given the run around. He ought to have gotten the opportunity to bite someone, I felt. But he was a bit stereotypical really. No character development going on there. Good acting with the deep woofs though. So, three unpleasant teenagers, one unpleasant victim. Even that might have made a decent film if it had been given a coherent plot. Three able-bodied teens and one old, blind man and they couldn't get away? It beggars belief. And how many times can the old trope of NOT finishing someone off when you have them incapacitated and at your mercy be used by directors? It's OLD. And people can't be smashed in the head with a mallet and show no effects. They can't be shot in the belly (after a beating and falling some considerable distance) and THEN be stabbed in the SAME belly with garden shears and carry on like nothing has happened. Maybe Hollywood directors should be forced to be shot and stabbed with garden implements before they make crap like this again. Why the three stars and not one? I watched it through to the end. It has some tense moments. The acting is good. The filming is solid. It's just bad writing. And however good you make the rest of the filming, any movie stands or falls on the quality and credibility of its writing."

I feel like the horror genre is dying to many filmmakers is playing it safe in not using creature mix with gore and good storytelling for this movie it's basic and forgettable nothing worth remembering because we get another serial killer instead of a new iconic villain or characters that stands out to remember.

","May contain mild spoilers: There isn't much more I can add about this travesty that hasn't already been said, but given the urge I'm about to do it anyway.
For me, the most important element of a film is a relatable protagonist. It will stand or fall depending on whether or not I care about the main character(s), and/or what becomes of them by the film's conclusion. Cinematography, direction, acting, and even script are secondary. A good example of a well made film with an irredeemable protagonist would be 'Saturday Night, Sunday Morning' by Karel Reisz, starring Albert Finney as Arthur Seaton; a loutish factory worker you wouldn't trust to look after your goldfish, who shoots air guns at old ladies, carries on with his workmate's missus, getting her pregnant in the process, and while he does receive the inevitable, well deserved beating from his mate's brothers, he learns nothing from the ordeal and still gets to skip away into the sunset with Shirley Anne Field. This, therefore, loses the film points for me. I know it's subjective but that's how I work.<br/><br/>Here, in 'Don't Breathe', we have an even less redeemable character whom we are presumably supposed to be rooting for even prior to the reveal that the person standing in her way, an OLD BLIND MAN that she, along with her wannabe gangsta boifrend and her useful friendzoned beta intend to BURGLE, isn't such a savoury character himself. But by then it was far too late, I'd already taken sides, and even though I was supposed to now wish him a slow painful death for his admittedly warped reaction to his daughter being killed, I wanted exactly the same fate to befall our thieving little trailer trash heroine. Right until the bitter end (yes I did stick it out in the vain hope that I'd get my wish), I was rooting for the old man and his dog all the way.<br/><br/>But of course, our cute little misunderstood house invader gets not only what she came for but three times the amount! Seeing as she no longer has to split it with her now dead colleagues...and of course, she gets to fly off into the sunset without a care in the world, leaving four dead bodies in her wake.<br/><br/>But wait! The fourth, the old blind guy, isn't dead after all! Leaving this horrible enterprise ripe for a sequel.<br/><br/>You can see it now.

","Don't Breathe is a huge disappointment for those hoping for a refreshing take on the horror genre.<br/><br/>The film centers on three teenagers Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) living in a destitute Detroit who burglarize homes in hopes of raising enough funds to one day leave Michigan for California. After receiving a tip about a veteran sitting on a large sum of settlement money from the death of his daughter the three decide to rob him to expedite their plans. They discover their target is blind while casing his home and think this will be to their advantage.<br/><br/>The film boasts that it is a revolution of horror but it falls into the most basic tropes. Majority of the jump scares are fake/false and the ones that had the most potential to be impactful were shown in the trailer for the film. The cat-and-mouse chase through the house is aggravating with arbitrary obstacles, dead ends and plot holes.<br/><br/>About thirty minutes in the film we find out that the Blind Man (Stephen Lang) has the woman that killed his daughter in his basement after she was found innocent of vehicular manslaughter. At first I thought this was supposed to be the big twist of the movie – even though this was shown in the trailer too – but after accidentally killing her the Blind Man revealed that she was pregnant with his child as a replacement for the one he lost.<br/><br/>After more cat-and-mouse antics, the Blind Man captures Rocky and intends for her to be his new surrogate. Strapping her into a homemade contraption that suspends her midair he begins to prep. The film was at the height of its tension and climax when the Blind Man pulled from his arsenal a turkey baster filled with his sperm. There was loud and raucous laughter from the audience I saw this with and I was one of them. It became even more ridiculous when Alex appears out of nowhere to rescue Rocky and during the scuffle Rocky shoves the semen-filled turkey baster into the Blind Man's mouth. The credibility of the entire film is undermined by this one scene and it made it difficult to take the rest of it seriously.<br/><br/>The most this film will achieve is cult status in the spirit of the original Evil Dead."

What I like about this is that it doesn't have any supernatural aspect to the story so it feels more real than most horrors. There are some quite disturbing scenes so it's not for the faint hearted .

I get that at first the dog was drugged but eventually it wasn't. Rocky wasn't going to outrun that dog. Even if, let's say, she could by some miracle...it'd have gotten her in the car. She wouldn't have been nearly strong enough to trap it after what she'd been through. Plus, the amount of money she was stealing would have weighed at least fifty pounds (if not more) and wouldn't have fit in that tiny backpack. Even if we pretend that it did, how was she going to outrun a dog carrying it?<br/><br/>Then we have the fact that a blind man somehow kidnapped a wealthy trust fund girl from her driveway and didn't get caught. How did he do this? What car was he driving? Did he just trick her? No. Not possible. We have the fact that the characters were too dumb to just leave and call the police anonymously. We have the fact that apparently the alarm could disorient the blind dude but that's only ever used as a last resort. We have these kids getting up from injuries that they would not get up from. We have people behaving the exact opposite of how normal humans would definitely behave. The only redeeming quality is SOME scenes were decently shot. Otherwise...why the heck does anyone like this?

","I am not a film critic. I do not pretend to be. Nor do I care. When I watch a movie I expect either entertainment or an interesting original artistic view into the human soul or mankind's history. Bottom line: it has to be fun or memorable to be worth watching. Otherwise it is a waste of time at best and poison the mind at worst.<br/><br/>This film is neither fun, nor memorable. It is a waste of time and a bitter pill.<br/><br/>This film is a tortured effort for a deep drama-thriller and is a massive fail. Its attempt to create some form of a moral is ludicrous. People with unhinged and nasty fantasies wrote it and put it together. No offense to Alvarez but I have no respect for his work. While keeping up with the secrets of the trade the characters are unrealistic, unsympathetic, and the ""glamorous"" ending, which contains a twist, does not make sense. You will be on the edge of your seat not because of suspense but because of disgust. As in all ridiculous contemporary films out of Hollywood, which makes 95% of them vulgar and deprave sexuality seems to be the way to entertain.<br/><br/>There were no good guys -- all bunch of criminal scumbags. The chick's cheesy dream to go surfing in California with her sister is just too cliché and ridiculous. I just could not sympathize with any of the characters. Art is the ability to compress in two hours a story which will show you life and will make you ponder. Forget about it with this flick. You'll be happy that it's over and sorry that you started it.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a film of high artistic quality, totally unpretentious, based on true events, watch Gruz 200 (Cargo 200, 2007, director Alexei Balabanov).

","There is so much to be said about this movie, more than I can say within the confines of the word limit. I am a lifelong die-hard thriller and horror fan, and this one ranks in my top 5. This is a very intense, morally complex, thinking person's thriller/horror. It takes it's time in building up with looming suspense, and then once the terror begins, it is unrelenting until the very end. This is a unique scary movie, in that for the longest time, it's very hard to know who, if anybody, to root for. Both sides have their sympathetic qualities, and both have their deeply sinister sides. The movie takes place in poverty-ravaged Detroit. The plot centers around three friends who are career criminals trying to get out of dodge, robbing houses for a living. The girl comes from an abusive, dysfunctional home, and wants more than anything to rescue her little sister from this environment, and establish a better life for them in California. They get a tip that there is house nearby whose owner is sitting on $300K in cash. They stake out the place and discover that it looks to be the perfect isolated target, in a ghost town of a neighborhood. They discover that the occupant is a blind veteran, who got the money in a settlement after his only daughter was killed in a car crash. Really messed up to rob such a person, right? But as one of the robbers points out, his misfortunes don't necessarily make him a saint. Upon breaking into the house, things go horribly wrong for this trio, and they find themselves trapped in the house with a person they grossly underestimated as an easy target. The sheer terror written on their faces throughout the movie is incredibly realistic. Ultimately, both sides lose something and gain something from the horrific ordeal. The ending was surprising and very satisfying. I'm downgrading it one star due to the revolting and completely unnecessary turkey baster scene. The whole wanting to make a baby factor was truly not needed, and distracted from an otherwise great plot. That aside, this was a nearly perfect film."

","Don't Breathe; Although not supposedly the scariest film ever, is definitely one of the most tension filling horror films of 2016, and one that executes flawlessly, dragging the audience into a never- ending nightmare, and truly succeeds. <br/><br/>We follow Rocky, Alex, and a dude named Money, they're a team that robs houses; Goal to move away. They come across news that a blind man has a large fortune, and all they have to do is break in. However, this break in isn't as easy as they'd hope for, now they must survive, and escape. First off, props to this films' atmosphere. The atmosphere throughout most of the film is eerily silent, due to the characters having to remain as silent as possible while trapped. With that silence, we're set to see multiple situations where tension is the only thing that comes to the audiences' mind. There are countless scenes where it gets intensely tension - filled, and it keeps us on the ends of our seats, and intrigued. The film also has a very eerie, dark - like setting as it progresses, only boosting to extreme heights on the tension level. Most of these occurrences are well played out by the actors, as well. The acting in this film, I'd say, in terms of what the characters were put through was perfect. They all genuinely put forth a believable, and well performance. Each character, as well had their own unique styles, and all of which were interesting enough for us to care in a sense, depending who they are. Another extremely enjoyable aspect of this film which overall was the unique, successful plot. The plot, and overall story-line of the entire film was extremely solid, and more than successful for audience tension, and thrill. It tied in unique twists, as well as guaranteed reaction elements. The pacing of this film, as well just boosts the unique plot, as this film went straight to the point, and wasted absolutely no time in getting the audiences' attention. <br/><br/>In conclusion. Is the hype for this film real? Yes; It, by no means is the ""Scariest film"" out there, but is it unique? And does it set itself away from the typical horror movie scene? Absolutely. This, for sure is one of the best horror films of 2016. This, I'd say is worthy of the top three films, even. This film was unique, innovative - like, and it brought new, exciting elements to the horror film scene. It was well paced, well acted, and on an even more specific realm, extremely well shot with camera-work. It was thrilling, exciting, and heavily effective with it's silent, unpredictable atmosphere, and endless - like attitude. The countless, yet outstanding twists this film takes, as well was more than worth the watch. ""Don't Breathe"" was more than enjoyable, and was worth the wait, as well as the hype. I strongly recommend checking this one out in theaters. You won't be disappointed."

","The story of 3 robbers named Rocky, Alex and Money who set their sights and future on robbing a blind man who has over 300,000 cash in his house. It's the perfect crime, but it doesn't quite go as well as they would have hoped! Director Fede Alvarez (Evil dead Remake) gives it his very best in this home invasion movie. Instead of wasting his time with nonsense and time wasting he gets straight to the point and as the movie goes on with the fast, roller coaster pace we get introduced to the characters bit by bit. And while we start to feel sorry for the Blind Man...we then realize he's on the same page, or just as bad as the robbers are.<br/><br/>Stephen Lang steals the show as The Blind Man. I could not have picked anyone else better to play him. This is living proof right here that not all blind men are saints. Lang gives us the most badass blind man you could have ever hoped for and he is really spooky and thrilling at playing him.<br/><br/>This movie is a home invasion movie, just like ""The Strangers, You're Next"" and ""Funny Games"" except with a huge twist, and that twist is...the the home invaders become the hunted! So it added a new style and a great original twist to the whole Home Invasion Movies. While many people would complain this is not a Horror, and more of a Thriller, that does not make it a bad movie. It is more of a Thriller, but there are Horror Elements in there to keep Horror Fans amused. And many people complained about the final 20 minutes and just how bad it got. We actually thought it worked out quite well. It showed us just how psychotic The Blind Man really was! All in all it's an edge of your seat Thriller. Go to the movie and take your girlfriend, you wont be disappointed! One of the best Horror/Thriller Movies that has come out in a long time. Can't wait to see more of Fede Alvarez. 5/5 - Jay<br/><br/>Home invasion thrillers have often popped up once in a while, but not since Your Next has there been a movie so thrilling, suspenseful and well executed... but Don't Breathe surfaced on our screens and now adds another gem to the genre.<br/><br/>Directed by Spanish filmmaker Fede Alvarez who had helmed the amazing Evil Dead remake/sequel, he returns in another hit that gives him the chance to helm a home invasion thriller. His eye on detail, camera work and the atmosphere reminds us that he can craft a film that can have an impact on us.<br/><br/>What I liked and admired about this one was the fact that it feels more like a thriller than horror, it relies on its scenario and how it executes it the moment the criminals are pulling off the robbery. The villain in particular was something that felt new or hasn't surfaced in a long time, but to have at first feeling sorry for him that he was blind and was about to be robbed than turned to being scared of him is a good move to add on on the viewers. Another interesting fact was that the violence wasn't over the top or gory, just brutal and nothing else, so this is another good thing that I liked about the film (though personally I am a gore hound fan when it comes to honor but this style can be quite interesting).<br/><br/>Stephen Lang's performance as the innocent looking but brutally strategic killer is one for the movie history books, focusing on movement and personality rather than dialogue makes him a worthy actor that should be seen more often (maybe as a hero for once as he's often a villain). The performances Jane Levy's performance is as great as her role in the Evil Dead remake, and the supporting cast makes it worthwhile.<br/><br/>The music score is great, with the returning of music composer of Evil Dead giving the tense game of survival a suspenseful feeling, kudos to his amazing work.<br/><br/>There's nothing negative I can say about the film, but Don't Breathe is a solid hour and a half treat that both horror and thriller fans will find great and will overtime become an example of how effective films can be.<br/><br/>4/5 - Nick"

In fact, the first time the old, blind man is introduced, he is unarmed and ""Money"" has a gun on him. Yet, the blind man manages to get just close enough to engage and kill ""Money"". Why didn't ""Money"" just put one in his knee (since it's established conveniently that no one lives in a 4 block radius)or side step the guy and pistol whip him? ... Oh, right, I guess that story line wouldn't have been too interesting.<br/><br/>Then of course, we get to the ""twist"".

Then, when things go wrong and he accidentally shoots the girl, he eventually captures ""Rocky"" (Jane Levy's character), spews some ridiculous dialogue in an extremely annoying voice, and threatens to impregnate her with a turkey baster. Seriously. <br/><br/>The idea was cool and Jane Levy is adorable and believable. That's about the only thing positive I could say about this movie. I was expecting more based on what I had heard but, the movie as a whole was awful.

But DON'T BREATHE will have you tense the entire time just like the characters themselves because it's filled with moments of silence and surprises. It's basically a cat-and-mouse chase game inside a locked and barricaded house. The ones getting chased don't know their way around the house, obviously, and the one doing the chasing, even though he's blind, let's just say that because of his background, he comes with a particular set of skills. And on top of that, there's a deep dark secret that adds to the layers and makes the characters' survival mode go to the extreme level.

","Don't Breathe<br/><br/>Fede Alvarez will soon be a household name in the horror genre (he probably already is) bc of the ultra gory and fun Evil Dead remake and also this instant gem of 2016. The storyline is pretty simple it didn't try to reinvent the wheel or anything but they executed it very well. The characters are surprisingly likable (and resourceful) despite them being anti- heroes. Fede really wanted to make a different and less bloodier flick so this one is toned down but u can still expect disturbing and highly suspenseful scenes throughout the short runtime. And lemme tell you i just LOVE the fact that they toyed with my feelings by giving a lot of false endings and it made me root for the leads so much more."
"hptmbedra","1","3","4","26 September 2019"," This movie is plain stupid
","I would put a stamp ""somehow plausible"" on this movie in the beginning but that wouldn't hold much longer after it got so ridiculous towards the middle that I rather spared my precious time by turning it off.<br/><br/>It is true that you have to like or somehow identify with the characters in order to really live the horror and this movie offered a very interesting twist: What if you actually liked also the character causing the horrible things happen? Reading the film's description, I expected a poor (but not exactly when he gets triggered) old vet who is forced to defend himself, and because it is dark and he's on his own battlefield, gives hell to the perpetrators. But they give us a guy who is a total monster and whom I would kill myself and then burglars, who try to justify their crimes by pretending to be some kind of modern Robin Hoods. They are such an unbelievable bunch of characters and their hope, that if they steal enough money, their lives will change, is ridiculous. So you have nobody left you can root for and therefore you don't care that much what happens to them, so you are basically left with jump scares and nonsensical plot.<br/><br/>Because what sense does it make to do houses, steal under 10k, sell the stolen stuff below the market price to a guy who takes 40% for him, and divide it between 3 people? After a few houses, wouldn't the police see the pattern considering the security installations are always the same? Fast forward to the house: Why is the old guy able to magically sniff out shoes but totally misses persons moving next to him, sweating and doing noise in the process? I know that blind people's senses sharpen so that they can eg. tell you what liquor is inside a bottle that just fell to a ground, so that doesn't sound particularly hard. And speaking about blindness, how the hell do you abduct a girl from rich neighborhood, prepare her this harem and never do a mistake such that she can escape, being blind?? And what kind of BS is this idea of impregnating her so that he can have his daughter again?<br/><br/>Needless to say, this was the moment where I quit. I rarely don't make it to the end but this movie just managed to persuaded me that I have my laundry to do. Avoid if you can."

Instead we get the above with a twist. The poor, old, blind vet is actually a twisted sadist fond of torture and pseudo rape. So he's not exactly a sympathetic burglary victim.<br/><br/>While they make the victim into a monster, they try to turn the criminals sympathetic. This shift in morality was likely meant to be compelling and norm-busting but instead it makes me long for what could have been, because there are interesting things here.

She has to fight for her life.<br/><br/>I love ""Don't Breathe"" from Fede Alvarez better than Evil Dead remake the film has similarity to The People Under the Stairs, The Collector and The Collection which are about Home Invasions horror rated-R films. Jane levy was terrific as Rocky the main heroine she did everything to stay alive and fight for her life. You have even a doberman dog in which he chases Rocky and try's to eat her.<br/><br/>The blind men (Stephen Lang) is a sick creepy pervert who has a dark secret in a basment. I have this movie on a Blu-ray disc. Don't Breath is a good movie, I wish their would be more booby traps set in the house like were in Friday the 13th (2009) remake, The People Under the Stairs and The Collector. The blind man wears two guns Beretta 92FS and Colt Python and shots to kill his intruders.<br/><br/>A really good creative visual scary horror film, well paced flick. It goes fast around, I enjoy it. I love Rocky and Stephen Lang's characther. I recomend this film to any horror fan. I love the film it is worth of watch.

","Sometimes a films sounds better on paper than it does when it's actually in front of you. I'd vaguely heard of the film 'Don't Breathe.' I knew it was a horror film and found out enough about the plot to interest me. It's about a trio of youths who like to spend their days burgling houses. Yes, a real group of protagonists you can identify with and root for – NOT! Okay, so the female of the three is okay-ish. We get enough backstory regarding her wanting to help out her family and take them away to a better future, but you can't really get around the fact that they steal things for a living.<br/><br/>Therefore, one day they think they're in for a 'free lunch' when they decide to break into a house that stands all on its own with the promise of great rewards to come. However, things don't go entirely to plan when it turns out that the old man who lives there is not someone you want to mess with (or even know!). Imagine breaking into Jason Voorhees' sitting room and you're sort of in the right area. Basically, what starts out as a routine cash grab turns into the three being stalked mercilessly for their lives.<br/><br/>So, it kind of sounds interesting, i.e. turning the initial bad guys into the unwitting victims. Sadly, it just didn't work out for me. As you've probably guessed, I didn't care much for the three kids and felt that the way we were supposed to care for the girl felt forced just so we feel something for her eventual plight. Plus there was the fact that I never really bought into the fact that they were unable to escape from a house. This isn't some giant country mansion with sprawling corridors and secret passageways. It's not far off your average detached house you'd see on most streets (I had the same complaint for the horror film 'The Collector!'). Then there was the way it was generally shot – it was too damn dark! I know that darkness goes hand in hand with horror movies and that it's a film-maker's tool to add atmosphere to the generally grim feel, but I just found I couldn't make out what was going on! All in all, if you don't watch an awful lot of horror films and just feel like something that's a little dark with a few jump scares and token blood and gore, then this will probably foot the bill. However, if – like me – you've seen every kind of maniac wear every kind of hockey mask despatching every type of teenage in every style of gruesome fashion, then this really doesn't offer enough that's new to really leave an impact. Yup, pretty much already forgotten most of it."

"CANpatbuck3664","9","13","28","28 August 2016"," An Excellent Thriller With a Complex Plot Line and Morally Gray Characters. I Was Blown Away by Don't Breathe
","Don't Breathe was one of those movies that I wasn't terribly interested in when I first heard about it. I then saw the trailer and the promotional material and I was a little more interested. It has a pretty cool setup and although the actors aren't big name stars (the only two I recognized were Stephen Lang and Jane Levy), the word-of-mouth around it was impressive. With it toppling Suicide Squad this weekend, I decided to check it out with a friend. I was so surprised with it, it's my favourite horror/thriller since Sinister, which is one of my all time favourites in that genre.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) are 3 burglars who work and live in Detroit. They have a pretty good system, they stick to small ticket items, they don't take cash and they get in and out quickly. They have an inside connection, Alex's dad works at a home security company and Alex is able to steal information from his dad's office to get keys and extra info on their targets. They aren't happy though, Rocky is especially miserable, she lives in a dump with her mooch of a mom and her sister who deserves a better life. They're desperate to get out of Detroit and there's a little bit of tension between them because Rocky and Money are involved and Alex is clearly on the outside pining for Rocky.<br/><br/>When Money is liquidating the stash from the most recent job, he gets a tip about another possible job. He's told that in one of the abandoned parts of Detroit, there's a lonely old man who is sitting on a about 300k from a settlement over his daughter being killed in a car accident. Rocky and Money are immediately in but Alex is reluctant. One of the reasons they go small ticket items and avoid cash is that any higher than 10 grand, it becomes more serious and the heat is worse. He backs out but shortly comes back after Rocky begs him to. They scout out the house, there's no one around and they plan to make their visit that very night.<br/><br/>So this movie was made by the people who remade the Evil Dead series. I liked that movie but I wasn't familiar with the older series so I didn't end up being as attached to it as some people did. This movie was really impressive from so many angles. I'll start with how well shot and how visually impressive this movie was. Being filmed in a confined space, this movie really could have been procedural and just run of the mill. The camera is always taking in new and interesting angles and the action was pretty well shot. It helps ratchet up the tension and helps create the illusion that the house is a maze that there is no escape from and they're being stalked by someone who knows the layout better than they ever could. It's a pretty terrifying thought and because of how much extra effort that was put in, the plot sells completely.<br/><br/>Another thing that this movie does so well that other movies fail at is that they play with the idea of who the hero and the villain is. You'll find yourself switching sides throughout the movie, I did a few times. Nobody is the hero here (Alex is the closest you get and even he's not completely good) and all the characters have twisted and selfish motivations. I prefer main characters who aren't saints, they're easier to identify with that way. It can be hard to do that but this movie strikes that balance and I enjoyed it that much more for it.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe doesn't have too many actors/actresses in it, the story mainly centres around 4 people, the 3 burglars and the old man. They are all excellent. I haven't seen Jane Levy since the Evil Dead movie but she was great. It wasn't always easy to like her character but her performance was always good. Dylan Minnette worked well as the conscience of the group and despite the fact his character was a jerk Daniel Zovatto was still likable as Money. I think the real standout was Stephen Lang, there were a lot of layers to his character and he's given a really deep backstory. With that in mind and his committed performance, he steals the movie.<br/><br/>I'd like to add a small note here, this movie gets pretty dark. The plot goes through some twists and turns and it gets more and more bleak. I don't want to spoil anything but there's a point in the movie where it gets kind of squeamish and while it didn't bother me because it just raised the stakes that much more, it could be hard to take for some people.<br/><br/>I'm so happy that I went and saw this movie. It was really intense, it was pretty terrifying and it went through plenty twists and turns. It kept you guessing till the end which is also extraordinary because they give you a glimpse of the ending at the beginning. I wasn't expecting too much from Don't Breathe and I got so much more. As much as I liked Suicide Squad, I'm happy that a movie that was this good is going to knock it off the top. If you like tense horror/thrillers GO SEE THIS MOVIE."

"RforFilm","9","11","23","30 August 2016"," The dark of Don't Breathe helps make this a scary but fun thriller about blindness
","2016's summer seems to be a swell year for horror and thriller genre. The Conjuring 2, Lights Out, The Witch, and The Shallows found audiences that seemed to push away from the many reboots and sequels that filled the blockbuster season. A lot of that has to do with how these stories felt original, even though these kinds of stories have been told before. With the summer dealing with sharks, haunted houses, evil spirits and magic, what else could the horror genre bring? How about home invasion in reverse?<br/><br/>The film in question may contain some similarities to David Fincher's Panic Room, but Don't Breathe has some major differences. Rather then the main character being the homeowner fighting burglars, we now have the robbers in focus trying to get away from the homeowner. Oh, and the landlord happens to be blind as well. So this movie seems to have a bit of Wait Until Dark in it as well (If you haven't seen it before, I highly recommend it as a great thriller with Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin). What's funny is that with a lot of those film elements, Don't Breathe happens to be a thrilling adventure, all confined in this one house with the goal of getting out.<br/><br/>In the slums of a ghost town looking Detroit, three twenty somethings, Rocky (played by Jane Levy), Alex (played by Dylan Minnette), and Money (played by Daniel Zovatto), are robbers who only take small cash and information, thanks to Alex's connection to his father's security who seems to handle most of the local houses alarm systems. Rocky has been looking to get her little sister out their broken home and make it to California to start a new life. She may finally get that chance with their latest tip about a resident who has hundreds of thousands stashed in his home. <br/><br/>When they get a glance at the blind guy's house, they see that he lives in an abandoned neighborhood with a mean rottweiler has his seemingly only defense. On the night they attack, their break in seems to go well, putting to the dog to sleep and finding an entrance through the basement. Just as the burglars seem to find where the money is, the blind man (played by Stephen Lang) is awaken by the noise and fights back hard. While hiding, the blind guy blocks all exits, leaving the robbers in a battle to see who can get out alive.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe is a very exciting thriller/horror that kept my theater quiet except for the occasional scream or gasp. Director Fede Alvarez (2013's Evil Dead) and producer Sam Rami have given us an interesting perspective of sympathies and earned scares. A lot of that is all on the performers, so let get into that. Stephen Lang was probably the perfect choice for a role like this, who must be the toughest blind character I've seen in recent years. I also enjoyed the chemistry of Rocky and Alex's characters as they do their best to stay alive in a true zone of darkness. <br/><br/>While film cannot recreate blindness well, Don't Breathe pulls of a number of tactics to do so from night vision to the use of sounds that one would hear better when they keep their eyes shut. The story may have you confused over which character you want to feel for, the script does give you enough backstory for you to make the decision. I'm also glad that the movie kept it's length short. It may seem like a bummer for those that want to be in the theater longer, Don't Breathe knows when to keep giving you scares and when to stop. It all falls into sync.<br/><br/>I'll give this nine white canes out of ten. Don't Breathe adds to 2016's list of original movies that people will come out too. Not that Hollywood needs to make more horror movies, but I hope their at least seeing that people want more original content. Close your eyes, and experience the dark and light of Don't Breathe."

","Something about it was just really good. It was crudely scary, but for some reason it was interesting, like a documentary.<br/><br/>I thought all the actors were older than me. They don't list the age of the 1st person who died, but the others were younger than me and I'm born in 1986. It makes me happy to see that younger actors are breaking into the business. They need to be seen more and make their mark. I personally was interested in acting, but it's so competitive, even if you aren't really that fat! It's like you have to be perfect these days,no double chin for most main dramatic roles.<br/><br/>The old man was pretty condescending. He seemed rather cool as a person. I wonder why he is so annoyed by the intruders. I found the girl to be the most agitated, I guess, a very doll-like beauty about her, too. It was sad how the boy who wanted to get out ended up suffering so, as well, however the girl survived. It is strange how happy people seemed that the old man was able to kill his intruders.<br/><br/>The side drama with the girl's family is interesting and how she survived and was with her sister again. They throw children into horror movies, which I enjoy because it reminds me of when I was a kid and my friends were into horror movies. I never saw them, and they were rated R, anyway, probably. I like them a lot now and see them when I go to the movies and they're out. I like the paranormal things a lot, which seems to be what most horror movies are.<br/><br/>I really grew attached to all 3 main characters. It seemed to possess a competitive edge, to it, too. The boy was really sweet. He is actually born in 1996. The girl is born in 1989.<br/><br/>There seems to be a hidden meaning about the man taking care of his own situations, too. Rather than have the government publicize it for him, he takes matters into his own hands, like he can't get enough revenge for what he hates and loathes. You know, rather than say posting your problems online, he just wants to fight. I do that, sometimes, try to justify and debate things with others telepathically or usually hopefully just thinking and justifying things to myself as they make themselves appear. Ultimately, I'm thinking the only way out is to post it online, for the world to see.<br/><br/>So, great work of the cast and all working together and pulling off what they did. I was really interested in this one in how it worked out and didn't leave the theater!"

The thieves see this guy as being easy pickings due to him ending up being blind as a result of serving in the Gulf War, but this homeowner isn't prepared to surrender his home or his money without a fight and our trio find themselves faced with a deadly adversary...<br/><br/>Don't Breathe is a wonderful film whereby its very excellence lies with its simplicity; it's another home-invasion thriller and at no point does it try to be anything else (it can hardly be accused of re-inventing the wheel). However, from the moment the thieves enter the victim's home the film never lets up and director Fede Alvarez keeps things moving at a rapid rate. The idea that the victim is blind only helps to crank the tension up and helps to keep the viewer on edge - I found myself looking and listening out for the slightest sound which may cause the homeowner to rumble the thieves.<br/><br/>Alvarez wisely keeps the direction tight and fluid and most of the focus lies on the thieves and their perilous journey to escape from a man that they feel that they shouldn't have tried to rob in the first place.<br/><br/>In some ways Don't Breathe is an odd film from a viewing perspective as you find yourself unsure who exactly you should be rooting for; you can't really root for the thieves (for obvious reasons) and part of you wants to root for the victim, but some twists later in the film kind of make it hard to do this as well. So what you need to do with this film is just go with the flow and sit back and enjoy this claustrophobic, terrifying and nerve-shredding thriller that basically grips you from start to finish and try not to get bogged down with any moral ambiguities.<br/><br/>Simply put this is a top-drawer home-invasion thriller which kept me on the edge-of-my-seat and helped me restore some faith in a genre that has produced rather mixed results over the years."

A group of young home burglars who are so cold they would even rob a blind man, or an old blind war vet who turns out to be a kidnapper, who not only stock piles jars of his own semen, but also tries to impregnate his victims with a turkey baster because as he proudly states ""I'm not a rapist"".  Also for experienced burglars you'd think they'd have some sort of stealth skills. Blind people are supposed to have a heightened sense of hearing and smell since they rely more heavily on them. However he can't hear these kids stomping around his yard, smashing windows, rummaging through his home for half the movie, and even firing a gun. He also can't seem to smell people standing right in front of his face, but can suddenly smell a shoe from across the room and realize there are multiple people in the house. The film was mildly entertaining, but an insult to the intelligence of the viewers. I am baffled by the high ratings it has been given."

","I was looking forward to seeing this film. It sounded like an interesting concept and had the potential to be scary, but it didn't take me long to realise that I was in for a big disappointment.<br/><br/>The characters, for a start, are poorly developed and thoroughly dislikable. The one thing all great horrors have in common is the ability to engage with the characters and actually care for what happens to them. With 'Don't Breathe', I didn't care whether any of the characters lived or died.<br/><br/>The plot is silly and we have yet another case of characters avoiding doing the bloody obvious for entertainment purposes. I expected so much more from this film, it was poor in all aspects."

","Evil Dead remake director, Fede Alvarez gives us the jumps in his house of terror of desolate Detroit. (Not seen the 'new' Evil Dead yet, but aware it was done with Sam Raimi's blessing, being a producer of the film.) Now this is a different breed of horror and don't assume you think you know what it's all about because believe me. You don't. (Unless you've already seen it of course) <br/><br/>What you should know, is that three would-be burglars break-in to a blind man's house in the hope of striking rich. Instead, hope is all they find as they become trapped and hunted by the blind man who is superbly played by Broadway superstar and Avatar Colonel, Stephen Lang. His looming presence and stature is terrifying, and being blind just adds to the tense atmosphere. <br/><br/>Evil Dead star (latest one again) Jane Levy takes the lead as Rocky, wanting to get out of Detroit for good and sees this as her great opportunity to do so, lead astray by her Boyfriend Money (Daniel Zovatto) and aided by her secret admirer Alex (Dylan Minnette.) All three are brilliant, though they look permanently shocked throughout, but you can't blame them as the shocks keep on coming. <br/><br/>There's none of this ""why you going in there?"" or ""why would someone do that?"" Like some horrors strive upon, instead this is just waiting for, or watching what happens next. You're not given much time to catch a breath, or even guess where it's is going or think of solutions. And if you do, you'll get hit by a curve ball, like a hammer to the face. It's disturbing but moves too ferociously to allow it to sink-in. <br/><br/>Though seeming quite original, I can see some elements from other horrors, especially Cujo, and this was probably the worse part for me, but still, it really works and adds to the non-stop surprises. It's dark, twisted, sharp and brutal. Absolutely relentless and really isn't what you might imagine. Alvarez does an amazing roller-coaster of a horror ride. Amazing job on the editing, and I can only imagine the screenplay looking like an organised mess, it certainly feels a lot longer than 88mins and not in a bad way. <br/><br/>It isn't scary like the conventional horrors or slashers but incredibly jumpy.

","I am not entirely sure if this could count in as a horror movie. It seemed more of a thriller to me. What I loved in the movie was the thrill sequences, the director's style of story telling and logically explaining a seemingly impossible plot. <br/><br/>Story (9/10): One blind man making a nightmare out of three burglars seemingly ""piece-of-cake"" burglary - can it get any better? The story was brilliant and provided a perfect ingredient for a high-intensity thriller. While the movie was sparse on the dialogs, which essentially increased the burden on the acting department, the conceptualization of sequences was absolutely brilliant - to the extent that you feel the frustration of being trapped in a house and each door for getting out getting closed (literally as well as metaphorically) one after the other. Although there were one or two technical mistakes in the plot, but overall it's a great job done by Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues. <br/><br/>Acting (8/10): Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette was great to watch with impeccable expressions. If at all this movie gets categorized into horror, it would be because of Jane and Dylan who projected the frustration, anger, fear and desperation amazingly well. Stephen Lang had a challenging role, playing a blind man but an army veteran, which went well with his muscular body and heavy voice. However, he plays a surprisingly brutal character. These three had a very large part of the movie. Rest of the supporting cast had very little screen time to show any acting prowess. <br/><br/>Direction (9/10): I loved the direction of Fede Alvarez. His way of storytelling is amazing. The idea of showing certain things (kind of dropping hints) which you feel would play a key role later in the movie as the burglars enter the house was great. The movie isn't long at all (just 1.5 hours) but still it goes for a little overkill towards the end with a dragged climax when you feel that this should be the end but the director says - ""Wait wait..... there's more!!"". Pretty good camera work during one of the sequences in complete darkness. He spent a little time in explaining the entire background of the burglary - which was great. I feel his way of explaining everything in a very logical manner provided a much realistic projection of seemingly impossible story - so, no loose ends anywhere. Great job there. <br/><br/>Overall (9/10): It's a great watch - definitely if you love thrillers or horrors. Great direction, brilliant storytelling, and edge-of-the-seat sequences."
"Chiller7","10","12","26","18 December 2016"," The Stephen Lang show
","Stephen Lang is such an impressive, intimidating-looking guy. At his age, he can still overpower and beat up a bunch of 20-something year old kids to a pulp on screen and do so perfectly convincingly. This movie relies entirely on his performance as the scary antagonist and he does so very well. That alone is enough to recommend this movie.<br/><br/>But that's not all that deserves praise. When this movie gets going, it's non-stop action and there's a natural flow and logic to the action too, which may seem like an unusual thing to praise, but it's more than we can say for a lot of other lazier thriller movies, where the victim characters make the dumbest possible decisions only to be picked off. I'd say this movie does a pretty good job of avoiding such clichés, because in this movie the characters make reasonable decisions for their own survival all along the way. If they go a certain direction, it's because it actually seems like the best way to go. If they get stuck in a dangerous spot, it's because they had no better choice. The characters in the movie actually managed to outsmart me, the viewer, at certain points. Their decisions to get out of certain perilous situations were actually pretty clever, leaving me thinking, well if that was me, I'd be dead.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is an effective thriller movie that's actually more fun than it should be, mainly because Stephen Lang is such an impressive presence on screen, that you'll actually enjoy seeing him every time he shows up, even though you're supposed to be afraid of him.<br/><br/>My only question is shouldn't the Blind Man's house at least have a workout room full of weights and exercise equipment? How else would this man stay in such superb shape?"
"ivo-cobra8","8","6","11","7 May 2017"," It is an okay creepy horror rated-R film I enjoy it
","It is an okay horror film that I enjoyed and I like it, but in my opinion I think The People Under the Stairs and The Collector are way much better horror movies. I appreciate for what director Fede Álvarez did. I hated Evil Dead remake I though it was poorly paced and really boring movie except the ending. Jane Levy did really fine solid job as the hero I really love the movie has happy ending and Stephen Lang as the villain was good I know him from The Fugitive TV series (2000). I already saw the horror movies before about burglars breaking in the house and find them self's been the target and locked in the house. For my opinion The Collector is just much way better movie even The People Under the Stairs are just way much better movies.<br/><br/>I do have one problem: I wish the movie would had more booby traps, I wish the death scenes would be more gory, it is a rated-R horror film, but still it was a good film, fast paced really intense and you keep rooting for the bad guys.<br/><br/>Their sure-fire break-and-enter scheme provides them with steady income, but delinquents Rocky, Alex and Money keep hoping for a bigger score. Their wishes are granted when Money receives a tip about an enormous sum of cash rumored to be stashed in a home in a desolate suburb of Detroit belonging to a blind, solitary Iraq War veteran. A B&E plan is hatched and quickly put into motion. What could possibly go wrong? Although it was a bit lightweight and featured ethically-challenged protagonists, this was a decent-enough suspense flick.<br/><br/>I didn't expect for this to be as good as it was. I was expecting a cheap thriller (this only had a budget of around $1 million) that did nothing for the viewers. I was not expecting to get goosebumps. This movie is twisted you got three idiots breaking in to somebody's house that is stupid, so we are going to root for the blind man - wrong: you will root for these three guys, when you find out what the blind guy has hiding in his house type of crazy weird sh**t going on in this movie and when they find out later on the end of the movie this is twisted creepy horror and I loved it.<br/><br/>I love Don't Breathe this movie was thought out, well written, every little things let in to something else. I like that and I like someone thought that out I like that. One is on the other location and he can't see it. Fede Álvarez did a good job better than Evil Dead the blind man was great and really creepy and scary the thrills are there and they work good. It is my favorite 2016 horror film and I like it, I thought it was an okay and fun movie. I liked Acting is great, the story is top notch and it gives you the edge of your seat. I would not compared this movie with Panic Room because Panic Room was also a great flick as well. It both has the same amount of way. I enjoyed this movie since Panic Room.<br/><br/>The ending was solid I love that Rocky survived she was not only sole survivor but Jane Levy's character was decent, she was breaking in to me someone else's house only to feed her young sister, they both have a messed up family and her mom is beating her, she survives and she takes her sister away but the blind man survives anyway. It is fast paced but in my personal opinion I like The Collector much more I thought Arkin (Josh Stewart) was much smart and way better protagonist. My rating is 8/10 solid B I like the movie in three weeks I am getting this movie on Blu-ray disc.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe is a 2016 American horror-thriller film directed by Fede Álvarez and written by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues.

","Filled with originality, timely jump scares, jaw-dropping twists, and terrific performances. Don't Breathe is meticulously well-paced and directed, as Fede Alvarez gives us the best horror flick of 2016.<br/><br/>I'm not a horror guy nor will I probably ever be. The genre never seems to stay good enough to grip me from film to film. But films like Don't Breathe do their best to turn my feelings around. Take for example the 'jump scare', something horror films tend to do provide a few too many of, is perfectly used in this film. I never felt that Alvarez was manipulating his audience into feeling scared in situations they didn't need to be. That's essentially what those 'jump scares' do, they make audiences scared because the story itself can't. It's lazy filmmaking. But when we do jump out of our seats in Don't Breathe, it feels earned. <br/><br/>The premise consists of a few low-life young adults who make their living on robbing houses and find themselves trapped inside the house of one of their 'supposedly helpless' victims. Their target was that of a blind man and Army veteran, played by Stephen Lang, living in a mostly abandoned Detroit neighborhood. I haven't seen a ton of horror, but this just seems like the perfect idea for a horror film. Plus, anything with Stephen Lang as the antagonist is worth watching. Not only can he pull off the physically intimidating side, but he also able to make it believable that he was blind.<br/><br/>And really, without much dialogue at all, all of the actors deserve a ton of credit. Jane Levy, who I never heard of, was a revelation. Both with what her character goes through physically and the emotional levels she was able to reach, I was greatly impressed. Even Dylan Minnette, who I wasn't a fan of in Goosebumps, did a fine job as a nice complement to Levy.<br/><br/>The actors were of course helped by Alvarez' unique vision and style of filmmaking showcased here. Minimal and timely use of lighting were a solid choice to set the mood, while long takes and close ups were also well oriented. I also have to give a shout-out to the sound department and the composer, Roque Banos. Sound is usually half of what makes a horror film, and Don't breathe doesn't disappoint in that area. Banos hits the right notes in all of the moments and the use of 'breathing' as a sound effect was extremely effective.<br/><br/>Without going into too much detail, I don't know how much more I can praise this film. It's truly a masterful directing job by Fede Alvarez with a star-making performance from Jane Levy and the great Stephen Lang.<br/><br/>94/100"

"bkrauser-81-311064","8","6","11","30 August 2016"," Don't Breathe - Don't Miss
","Don't Breathe builds its tension the hard way. Instead of relying solely on jump scares and gore, the film consistently paints itself and its characters into a corner then creatively gets them out of a bad situation while being both unexpected and completely organic. It's a hard high-wire act and one that you'd think a genre director like Fede Alvarez would stumble on. Yet Don't Breathe not only continues the Hitchcockian chamber-piece Renaissance kicked off by Disturbia (2007), it runs away with it. It artfully repackages old- fashioned thrills and kills it with a third act that's ominous but earned.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe concerns the exploits of three white-trash miscreants named Rocky (Levy), Alex (Minnette) and Money (Zovatto). They live in post-bankruptcy Detroit, because horror producers find the scene of boarded up houses, blighted streets and deserted neighborhoods far too spooky to pass up. Plus with the average time for emergency response being 41 minutes, the pesky instinct to call the cops is left completely off the table. The trio are banking on this, in addition to Alex's family ties to a security company to rob houses with impunity. With one more score under their belts, Rocky and Money hope to move to California and escape their life of rust-belt entropy. Their target, a blind shut-in (Lang) whose recent court settlement made him a crotchety late-life millionaire. What the would-be thieves don't expect however is for their target to be so resourceful and so deadly.<br/><br/>Anyone familiar with Stephen Lang's filmography would know that the man has a long history of playing the grizzled tough guy and Don't Breathe's unnamed Blind Man is no exception. Despite having a little over ten lines and spending a large portion of the film wondering with arms out, he dominates the frame with muted bellicose. He's scary not only because he's a brutal close-range brawler but because his disability reminds us that he's still human. A human whose life has descended into a Nietzschean perversion - ""Man can do anything, once he knows there is no God,"" he says in a moment of well-earned shock and disgust. <br/><br/>When his humanity is questioned, in a second act reveal that steadily raises the stakes, our sympathies then ricochets back to our trio. Up until this point, were given the average wafer-thin backstories girdled with teenage neglect, alpha-male shows of dominance and unrequited love. Yet as the Blind Man becomes more invested in their demise and their routes for escape become limited, we as the audience feel for our teenage lambs; if for no other reason than we're right there with them. <br/><br/>I won't go as far as to say, the characters have become fully formed by the time the credits roll, but I do admire their resourcefulness throughout. They deal with the claustrophobia of their plight with sharper and sharper fight or flight instincts complimented with masterful cinematography by Pedro Luque. His camera-work allows the audience to truly immerse themselves in the space, keeping us glued to not only the characters but what their seeing...and more importantly what they're not seeing.<br/><br/>If there's a spiritual grandfather to Don't Breathe it's almost certainly Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948). Not only is the cinematography eerily similar but so are the themes which parities feeling of superiority (in this case moral not intellectual) with the banality of evil. 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) may have been this year's torchbearer for the old master's brand of suspense thus far this year but I'm going to go ahead and say its reign has been short-lived. Don't Breathe - don't miss."
"LloydBayer","8","6","11","30 August 2016"," Shocking, intense and terrifying
","Remember that hilarious film about a kid outwitting burglars in Home Alone? Now get a load of Don't Breathe, a clever twist on the home invasion genre that will have you quivering in fear instead of laughing out loud. <br/><br/>There's a significant twist too but before this is revealed, director and co-writer Fede Alvarez wastes no time in unleashing a truckload of terror. A quick introduction tells us that petty thieves Rocky, her boyfriend Money and Alex are down on their luck until they receive a tipoff about an old man who received a cash settlement after his daughter was killed in a car accident. To their pleasant surprise, the old man is blind and he lives alone in an abandoned neighborhood. But once they break into his house, there awaits more surprises that are not so pleasant, and as it turns out, shockingly nasty for us too. <br/><br/>Deeply rooted in the horror-thriller genre, Don't Breathe spans at just under 90 minutes, but don't underestimate its relatively short running time or its skimpy production budget. In just his second offering since the Evil Dead reboot, Alvarez delivers with almost Hitchcockian precision by using suspense and shock like a one-two punch combo. And although these are his principal tools to induce primal fear in the audience, there's plenty more at work to have viewers peeping through their fingers. Technical aspects like deft camera-work and sound mixing amplifies the fear factor to discomforting claustrophobia, owing to which the mounting peril on screen becomes directly proportional to increasing stress levels experienced by the viewer.<br/><br/>While the actors playing the burglars are virtually unknown, Jane Levy as Rocky and Daniel Zovatto as Money aren't new to horror, having previously starred in Evil Dead and It Follows (2015) respectively. As the script dictates, they don't have to say much yet successfully depict the outright horror of facing a superior and deadly antagonist known simply as 'The Blind Man' (Stephen Lang). If you thought Lang was a menacing villain in Avatar, nothing but nerves of steel can prepare you for his terrifying delivery in this film; and that's before his character turns off the lights. <br/><br/>Don't Breathe isn't the kind of gimmicky horror film made for cheap thrills. And if one cares to notice, there's even subtle social commentary on the failing economy in parallel to an unstable justice system. But that's just the film at its lightest. At its best, this is a horror film that is wickedly dark and for some viewers even nerve-wrecking to the point of suffocation. But then the title is already an apt warning – watch with bated breath."

","I went into this movie with some hope, as the idea was original, even if a bit hateful towards blind people. This movie starts out great and rapidly devolves into unbelievable land, with unstoppable killer dog, check, unstoppable indestructible psycho killer, check, continuous lethal wounds that seem to do no real damage, to the psycho or the kids, check.<br/><br/>Another factor is you really don't know who to root for in this movie. Do I really care that some criminal break in punks are getting their comeuppance? No, kill them all. So the movie suddenly realises this 3/4 of the way in and has to solve it, by somehow making the blind guy super evil. They do this with a disgusting sexual sidebar that makes you literally want to vomit. This movie is all over the map. It wants to be a standard teen slasher movie, but it didn't bring enough disposable teens to be murdered, so it makes them indestructible instead, except for the first token kill. It wants to be a creepy sexual abduction movie, but we don't even get a hint of this direction until the movie is nearly over. I left greatly disappointed and very nauseated."

The story-line went absolutely smoothly, very easy to follow. There were surprises & I was constantly grabbing my husband's arm out of fear.

"cschultz-2","5","7","14","12 September 2016"," Tension to spare, but nobody to care about
","I don't know whether the remarkable physical resemblance between actor Stephen Lang and horror novelist Stephen King was a factor in Lang's being cast in Don't Breathe, but the similarity provides a nifty extra dimension in a picture with enough plot twists and reversals of fortune to keep the viewer's head spinning for most of its 88-minute running time.<br/><br/>In Don't Breathe, three burglars lured into a life of crime by the economic despair of their Detroit environment seek to score one final payday before retirement by pulling a heist on the home of a reclusive military veteran blinded in battle during the Gulf War. That the veteran resides in the solitary home remaining in an otherwise-deserted neighborhood fails to provide a clue to the erstwhile criminal masterminds that their target knows a thing or two about survival.<br/><br/>From the looks of the trailer, Don't Breathe appeared to be a fairly interesting variation on the ""Boy, you picked on the wrong guy this time, punk"" theme made popular decades ago by actor Charles Bronson and director Michael Winner in Death Wish and its sequels. I was a little confused that what appeared to be an intense urban drama was being marketed to the public as a horror picture, but sometimes a picture needs that extra little oomph to find an audience.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe as expected turns fairly quickly into a game of cat and mouse between the sight-impaired quarry and the brain-impaired burglars, with the advantage being switched back-and-forth often enough to make the picture almost resemble a Road Runner cartoon. The problem is that about halfway through the picture the plot takes an absurdly-unexpected turn toward the gamy, and launches Don't Breathe into both another dimension and another genre. From that point on, the picture works hard to earn and maintain its R rating.<br/><br/>The ultimate trick played on the audience is that there's really nobody to root for: As in real life, distinctions in morality become blurred---nobody's completely good or completely bad: Even the dog is conflicted. There's tension galore in Don't Breathe, but no emotional investment in the characters...any of them. As a result, I emerged from the screening--maybe escaped would be a more accurate term--feeling a little cheated...and a lot used.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe is making money hand-over-fist, so in the final analysis the morality of the piece matters little to the filmmakers and producers.<br/><br/>But ultimately, before the end of the picture I found myself rooting for Detroit."

The trio consist of the token hot girl, the asshole and the nerd! (Guess which one lives and which one gets killed) hmmm ...

","Don't Breathe (2016) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Extremely well-made and intense thriller about three small-time criminals (Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto) who make their money by breaking into homes. They decide to focus in on the home of an Iraqi vet who is blind because of a large settlement he received and they believe the cash is inside the house. It doesn't take long for them to realize they've made a major mistake.<br/><br/>Fede Alvarez directed and co-wrote this film, which is without question one of the best thrillers that I've seen from recent years. Everything about this movie is pretty darn good, although I will admit that once it was over I was able to pick apart several logical issues. With that said, while the movie is going on there's no question that it keeps you on the edge of your seat and also manages to make you not look away from everything that is happening.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into many details because there are some twists and turns that shouldn't be ruined for anyone. I must admit that I thought the story worked perfectly well and I also thought that the director did a great job with the visual style of the picture and the fact that once he gets your pulse rate up he never lets go. The most impressive thing about the film is the fact that you're basically stuck inside the home and yet the director is able to get tension from every room in the house as well as every twist in the story.<br/><br/>Levy is wonderful in the lead role as the criminal who is trying to get one last score so that she can protect and move her sister out of a bad household. I also thought Minnette and Zovatto were effective in their roles playing two totally opposite characters. Then there's Stephen Lang who is downright magnificent as the old blind man. He's certainly a very threatening character and Lang plays him to perfection. Again, I'm not going to spoil anything but lets just say Lang plays everything wonderfully well.<br/><br/>I did have some issues with the picture including the fact that only in today's day and age could there be a story about three worthless criminals who break in on a war vet and they are the good guys. I must admit that I had a hard time cheering for these three lazy kids who went for crime instead of a real job. Some moral conflicts aside, DON'T BREATHE was a highly entertaining and very effective thriller."
"zardoz-13","10","12","28","4 September 2016"," Wait Until Death
","Horror movies have grown increasingly lazier these days with their dependence on jump-scares to terrify audiences. As the exception to this rule, ""Don't Breathe"" shuns jump-scares for a frightening storyline. ""Evil Dead"" writer & director Fede Alvarez and co-scripter Rodo Sayagues have created a superior, spine-tingling saga of suspense, sparse on dialogue, but swarming with surprises that will make your skin crawl throughout its tense 88 minutes. Mind you, one of those standard-issue scary movie tropes remains intact in this gripping, atmospheric opus. Nevertheless, you'll experience as much paranoia as our protagonists who find themselves trapped and terrorized in this home invasion thriller. The set-up is incredibly simple. Three teens have a foolproof plan for burglary. Equipped with the security codes and ways to silence alarms, these three should be prepared to steal something of value. A golden opportunity lands in their laps. Not only do they have a chance to score drastically with one big haul, but they may also never have to resort to crime again! Not-surprisingly, things begin to go dreadfully sideways almost immediately. They have learned about a blind military veteran, injured by grenade splinters in Iraq, who lives alone in a secluded derelict neighborhood and has a million dollars stashed in a safe. If the burglars, two single guys and a single-mom with a kindergarten aged daughter, can pull this off, they will be on easy street. Just as it all seems to be within their grasp, they encounter their worst nightmare. If you've seen the trailer for ""Don't Breathe,"" you may have been reminded of the climactic scene in ""Silence of the Lambs"" when an FBI agent stumbled around in the dark while a serial killer equipped with night vision goggles stalked her relentlessly in a creepy house. ""Don't Breathe"" appropriates that predicament, but expands it radically. Alvarez and Sayagues display imagination galore in this claustrophobic cat and mouse nail-biter, and the suspense never slackens, even after you think that the filmmakers have run out of tricks to torment you.<br/><br/>Alex (Dylan Minnette of ""Goosebumps"") takes advantage of inside information from his father's security firm so that Rocky (Jane Levy of ""Nobody Walks""), her boyfriend Money (Daniel Zovatto of ""It Follows""), and he can burglarize houses with little chance of being caught. They have an amazing track record, and they haven't botched up any of these opportunities. ""Don't Breathe"" opens with our youthful protagonists rampaging through an affluent house pilfering whatever they find of value. Meantime, the most desperate member of the threesome is Rocky who lives with her abusive mother and struggles to raise an adorable daughter who doesn't have a clue about how amoral her mother is. Alex has a thing for Rocky, and Money struggles jealously to keep his accomplice in line. Later, Money stumbles onto information from the guy that he fences stolen items to that an individual in a remote, virtually unpopulated, Detroit suburb keeps a million dollars in cash squirreled away in his apartment. Our unsavory protagonists carry out surveillance on the neighborhood and are surprised when they spot the so-called 'The Blind Man' (Stephen Lang of ""Avatar"") out in the daylight exercising his pet Rottweiler. When they determine that their victim is in fact sightless, they cannot wait to break into his residence. Initially, they put the Blind Man's pugnacious pooch to sleep in its dog house with a smoky concoction. Nevertheless, gaining entrance to the house proves to be difficult. Indeed, Rocky manages to climb in through a high window. Once the three gain entrance, Money unleashes a crude form of knock-out gas on the slumbering Blind Man to prevent him from interfering with them during the burglary.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite all of his bravado, Money cannot muster the nerve to pull the trigger on his automatic pistol when the Blind Man catches them by surprise during a harrowing moment. Alex and Rocky are just as shocked by the Blind Man's startling appearance and struggle to hold their breath and stand rooted like statures while the Blind Man kills Money. Eventually, Alex and Rocky manage to hide themselves, with Rocky taking refuge in a closet. She is shocked when the Blind Man enters the closet where she has holed up, but watches in triumph as he opens a safe and inventories the contents. As traumatized as she is by the sudden reversal of events, Rocky decides that she isn't going to leave the house without the loot. She memorizes the digital combination and later cleans out the safe. Alex and her struggle to escape from the Blind Man's house. What might seem like a simple proposition turns out to be an ordeal. The menacing but resourceful Blind Man knows every square inch of his house, and he has it rigged up so nobody can possibly escape. Our protagonists had to go to extraordinary lengths just to effect an entrance, and they discover that getting themselves out is going to be virtually impossible.<br/><br/>Now, based on this plot synopsis, you'd think ""Don't Breathe"" might degenerate into a predictable blood and gore potboiler, but you'd be entirely wrong. Discretion prevents me from providing greater details about the plot. Some of the complications will have you poised on the edge of your seat with your white-knuckled fists clenching the armrests of your chair. Furthermore, by this time, you may not be as well-disposed about the welfare of the trespassers, since their selfish motives and apparent advantage over the Blind Man him make him appear more sympathetic. Not only do things get more complicated, but the action also takes a truly bizarre twist that you won't foresee. Ultimately, the Blind Man turns the tables on his sighted adversaries, extinguishing all forms of illumination, so they wind up on equal footing with him. Stephen Lang is terrific as the Blind Man who never knows when to quit, while Jane Levy looks suitably horrified by some of the predicaments in which she finds herself. ""Don't Breathe"" will leave you gasping."

","Rob a blind war-veteran's house, how hard is that going to be you think? Well, if it's this guy you think you want to rob, you better give it another thought. Fede Alvarez rebooted or remade (one of the two) Evil Dead and now he comes up with this?! He is the master of R-rated thriller/horror, no doubt about that. If you have read till here but haven't watched the movie yet,I'd suggest you to go watch the movie 1st. It will definitely be worth it. Then come read this, this review ain't going anywhere. Those who have watched it though, carry on.<br/><br/>DIRECTION - Even though Evil Dead didn't receive any critical acclaim but I absolutely loved it. Fede Alvarez knows how to mix music, lighting and believable characters and serve it as a beautiful dish. Well, by the end of the movie I don't think so the word 'beautiful' will hold up but you know what I mean. I was kind of confused with the opening shot. I thought, why show the conclusion? Now, I know what is going to happen? Then when you give it a few more minutes and things start to roll and take shape you forget about the ultimate consequence and get way too invested. The last time I was so invested in a horror/thriller movie was the Descent. I was absolutely shattered at the final reveal in that movie and it happened again with this one. The movie did falter at places like the characterisation. There is always a douche, a damsel and the hero character. The trick is to humanise them and make them believable. The damsel is a mixture of a damsel and a hero and the hero is a mix of damsel and hero. Well the douche is still a douche. The ending particularly is amazing. If you pause the movie at the right moment, you can see him standing right there. I think.<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY - Right from the aerial shot in the beginning of the movie, you know the movie is going to have the right tone. The colour grading is perfect. Most of the movie is in low light, dim light and even no light. Pedro Luque deserves a standing ovation for his amazing work. It is very difficult to capture claustrophobia and invoke that feeling in the audience even though you are not claustrophobic. I can't praise his work enough. I am actually using one of the shots in the movie as the featured image because it is that amazing. Marvel needs a good cinematographer. Just saying. Here is a guy. TAKE HIM ALREADY!!<br/><br/>ACTING - I tip my imaginary hat to Stephen Lang. I haven't seen much of him after Avatar but man that was something. Psychotic, strong, unhinged, ferocious and I am still defining his character. He is Stick, Daredevil, Logan and Batman all mixed up into one. It was amazing. He has very few lines and he does some amazing job without saying anything. Great job by the young cast of Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette. They started very wooden and clichéd but right after the action started they brought on their A-game.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT - Certainly going up in my Top 10 movie list. I love movies that leave you disturbed. I mean if it intends to do so then you should feel disturbed or else the movie hasn't done it's job. Definitely, definitely watch it. I can't emphasise this enough. It's so great to see so many different kinds of movies being made. The movie is so well balanced between two dark sides and you feel morally obligated to choose a side. I love the mental duel that a movie provides and through this process it reminds the audience and film-makers the craft of engaging the audience while also creating a great movie."

","Stephen Lane just made me understand how many of our main natural senses are good and bad for us. I loved the creativity of making a blind man have more enhanced senses than others because his blindness causes him to be more experienced in his other senses. And the fact that he had the training of a war veteran made the movie even more intense. This movie has been one for the ages with all the other movies that were considered suspenseful and just basically flat lined and ended up being a waste of money, but this movie truly made up for a lot and I would say Fede Alvarez needs to make more suspenseful movies, because that was creative and great planning and everything. I do wish the movie ended with the this psychology ill blind man ended up killing all the characters, but I can't wait to see the spin off if there will be one. Truthfully the only thing I did not like was the whole Atheist and religious thing with basically trying to generalize Atheists as sick evil people and that's not the case, but besides that I love the movie and just hope there is left mention of god and beliefs and just focuses on the suspense of the movie."

","Three teens venture into an old man's to steal his money and find out that it isn't that easy after all. It sounds like a simple premise, but by the movie is over much has happened, and there are plenty of twists and turns along the way.<br/><br/>What the two young man and the young lady find is way more dangerous and darker than anyone could expect. To begin, in spite of his blindness, their prey is not as defenseless as they hoped, and soon they become his preys, as he hunts each one of them throughout his home. Suddenly they discover there is one more person in the house, and this person sheds more light on the nature of the old man's motivations.<br/><br/>Their battle is long, with the advantage changing through some lucky or unlucky move, and the intensity of their encounters grow as the story goes on, reaching a resolution we suspected but not quite turning out that way. <br/><br/>""Don't Breathe"" succeeds because it's thrilling from beginning to end, though we really never get to know much about the characters, there's enough to develop some sympathy for the two parties. Yes, everyone is a criminal to a point, both driven by different types of madness and the need to survive or outsmart each other. Stephen Lang's feature and great physical shape make his ability to deal with the younger people. There are very few lines in the movie, but the conversations are rich, without a wasted moment. <br/><br/>Be prepared to stay glued to the screen, waiting, with much suspense threatening to take your breath away."

","""Don't Breathe"" had a concept that appealed to me. Three Detroit teens are systematically robbing houses of goods to pawn with the aim of getting Rocky (Jane ""Evil Dead"" Levy) out of the clutches of her deadbeat family to start a new life in California with her younger sister. Dylan Minnette plays the cautious and intellectual Alex, hiding his crush on Rocky particularly badly. Daniel Zovatto plays the fruit-loopy stoner 'Money' – the loose cannon of the trio and Rocky's boyfriend.<br/><br/>After a successful run, they unwisely pick on the home of a blind war veteran (""Avatar""'s Stephen Lang). He is not just 'Home Alone' but 'Neighbourhood Alone' (reflecting, probably accurately, the demise of previously affluent suburbs in some industrially declining US cities). Blind or not, the vet (and friend) are a force to be reckoned with: with startling speed the tables are turned and the kids are fighting for their lives. And there are more surprises in store within the spooky old house.<br/><br/>As an audience member, there are certainly points at which the title becomes uncomfortably literal! On the tensionometer, there is a similarity here with last year's ""No Escape"". A scene where blindness is turned into a positive asset is particularly effective.<br/><br/>As is common with this genre, the film suffers from a plot-line that at times makes no sense and involves indestructible participants (with an incident involving garden shears being particularly incomprehensible).<br/><br/>A particularly unpleasant sexual-threat scene towards the end of the film is also nonsensical involving a level of -ahem – 'preparation' that the preceding plot simply doesn't merit.<br/><br/>Inevitably though, the film lives or dies on whether you feel empathy for the disreputable kids in peril. The start of the film tries to balance the empathy scales by giving Rocky her backstory, throwing in the 'little sister' card. It also demonstrates that ""The Blind Man"" is a 'bit of a bastard' – or perhaps that should be a 'bit of a baste-ard' (LOL, in-joke)). Unfortunately however I hold the peculiarly unfashionable idea that if things are ""mine"" they are ""mine"" – not anyone elses: so, on balance, I wasn't rooting for them and would be happy to let the thieving little sh*ts all get beaten to death! Jane Levy (channelling a young Emma Stone) acquits herself admirably as the heroine in peril. Also of particular note is the highly effective atonal score by Roque Baños that ramps up the tension extremely effectively. Directed by ""Evil Dead"" director, Uruguayan Fede Alverez, the film does have a certain style and is an enjoyable roller-coaster ride, provided you park your brain at the (well locked) door.<br/><br/>(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review, and to subscribe for future reviews.

","Wow, what a waste of talent. I finally saw this when it came on cable, what a disappointment. The story plot of a trio going to rob a blind veteran that lost his daughter automatically has you despising the characters. Predictably they underestimate their target and walk into a booby trapped house. But the blind guy apparently hasn't had his sense of smell overcompensate for his blindness because he can't smell them hiding right under his nose while sweating bullets. A lot of cat and mouse and then the added introduction of weirdness finding out the blind guy isn't anyone to root for either. A better ending would have been for the final character to have not escaped w/the money. They are planning a sequel. Can't imagine where you go from this mess.

","Unemployed and unable to find legitimate work, three young adults take to thievery as a last resort, however, breaking in a blind Vietnam War veteran's house leads to some horrific twists in this home invasion thriller produced by Sam Raimi. From the premise alone, the film sounds a lot like the earlier Adam Schindler movie 'Intruders' (aka 'Shut In') with the notion of the person whose home is being invaded being less helpless than first appears. Along these lines, 'Don't Breathe' seems to up the ante by making the thieves sympathetic; Jane Levy's character in particular has extensive early scenes in which we come to understand how much she and her younger sister not only want but need to move away from home. This dynamic renders the first half of 'Don't Breathe' quite interesting as we are pulled between feeling sorry for the blind war veteran and for the thieves with various incidents causing our sympathies to swing back and forth. The film disappointingly chooses a side around halfway in though as it is revealed that the veteran has a shocking secret in his basement. Not only is the secret implausible, it places us in an awkward position where ethically we have to root for the thieves instead, which just does not sit right. The film certainly has enough in the thrills and chills department that it is entertaining until the end and the pacing is never off. There is also a lot to like in the idea of the war veteran being better equipped than the thieves even without his sight, even if this idea could have perhaps been put to better use."

The films works as a horror film for a number of reasons, many of which are easily understandable.<br/><br/>""Don't Breathe"" is receiving its well earned attention and success because it is something new within contemporary horror cinema. Today, we are bombarded with films that try to scare us in a non scary and overused way- think Paranormal Activity sequels, The Boy, The Shallows etc... These films heavily rely on frightening the audience with A)found footage, B) CGI or C) jump scares. We are tired of the same old formula. But the guys behind ""Don't Breathe"" saw this audience expectation as an opportunity to make something really great and terrifying. The film indeed does have jump scares, but not one every 2 minutes. In fact i think there is barely 5 times in the film where the audience is meant to jump out of their seats. In the majority of the film,the audience is left not only on the edge of their seats, but in the situation of the characters. The use of terrifying long takes and silence make this film feel realistic and authentic, and it doesn't need found footage to do it. <br/><br/>""Don't Breathe"" has definitely breathed new light into the horror genre, and i am looking forward to the sequels and films that copy this formula in the future. All in all, ""Don't Breathe"" is the greatest contribution to horror cinema since ""The Blair Witch Project"" and the best horror film(minus the ""Babadook""-they're both on the same level) since Scream. <br/><br/>WARNING:Please don't die of suffocation during your viewing of this film."

The jump scares are kept to a bare minimum. Instead, there is a growing feeling of doom, as we continue watching the movie. Despite the lack of jump scares, this film will still terrify audiences. The various twists & turns, will keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. The cinematography by Pedro Luque is awe-inspiring & is the highlight of the movie. The background score by Roque Banos is unforgettable. The flawless performances, are the main reason this film works so beautifully. Stephen Lang is fantastic as The Blind Man.

Alvarez directed, co-produced and co-wrote the movie (with Rodo Sayagues). Horror master Sam Raimi (who of course directed the original 'EVIL DEAD' franchise) also co-produced the flick; which stars Jane Levy, Stephen Lang, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto. Alvarez, Sayagues, Raimi and Levy all performed the same duties on the 2013 'EVIL DEAD' reboot. The film was made on a budget of just $9.9 million; and it's already made almost three times that, in it's opening weekend. It's gotten almost unanimously rave reviews from critics, and it was another entry in this year's 'Fantasia International Film Festival'. I think it's a masterpiece. <br/><br/>Rocky (Levy), Alex (Minnette) and Money (Zovatto) are three young crooks; that rob wealthy customers of Alex's dad's security company. Rocky is trying to make enough money to move her, and her little sister (Emma Bercovici), away from their abusive mom (Katia Bokor). She wants to start a new (happy) life for them, in California. Alex has strong feelings for Rocky, but she's currently dating Money (who's of course an asshole). When the three friends learn of an old Army veteran (Lang), with a $300,000 cash settlement (or more) sitting in his home, the job seems too tempting to pass up. When Alex learns that the man is blind though, and that his young daughter was recently killed in a car accident, he doesn't want to go through with the heist. His feelings for Rocky (of course) motivate him into it. It's a crime that the three criminals desperately soon regret, when the blind vet starts hunting them down, and killing them, in his own (locked-up) home. <br/><br/>The movie is about as good as horror films get; it's a soon to be classic (on a Hitchcock level standard)! I'm a big fan of the 2013 'EVIL DEAD' (and of course the original franchise), but this film is even better. The concept of a blind old Army vet, hunting down intruders in his home, is brilliant. Usually only heroes, in films, are handicapped; making it much more inspiring, when they overcome their weaknesses (through hard work and passion, of course). So to make the villain the handicapped one, who's still just as relentless (and terrifying) as any other movie 'bad guy', is really fun to watch. Especially when the protagonists are severely morally flawed, as well. I had so much fun watching this movie, and I can't wait to see it again! Lang is also amazing in it, and I think a sequel could be a lot of fun as well.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/bmrjYaOGPmk"
"MitchellCombden","8","8","18","30 August 2016"," an excellent and fresh take on the home invasion sub genre
","don't breathe is director Fede Alvarez's sophomore effort and I will say it is definitely a success. coming off of evil dead (2013) Fede needed a hit he could call his own. he delivers. don't breathe has some good camera work. nothing super fancy but it does the film justice and uses its setting to the fullest advantage. the setting being the old blind mans house, it is very claustrophobic and dimly lit. creating a very tension filled atmosphere in which the director is able to create some real suspense. the aspect of the ""victim"" (the old man) being blind also adds to the suspense, characters are holding their breathe and crouching and what not to avoid being captured and each time a scene like this occurs the tension is undeniable. the movie becomes an unnerving thrill ride of cat and mouse. it is no doubt entertaining to watch. something I must give this movie props for is its amazing lighting. in scenes of pure darkness we can still depict what is going on on-screen without the atmosphere and disorienting urgency of the scene being extinguished. the unique thing about this telling of a simple story though is that the tables turn. in terms of who we are rooting for and why. our main characters would normally be considered ""bad people"" for breaking into this old blind mans house in the first place. but at the same time the lead character played by Jane levy (who by the way gives us another excellent performance in this film) has a legitimate reason for doing what she is doing. her supporting character (his name escapes me) is also revealed to be heroic and noble. eventually we learn this old blind man isn't so innocent and the tables have suddenly turned. these terrible people who broke into a poor old blind mans house become our anti heroes and the ""victim (the blind man) becomes our villain. Stephen Lang does an amazing job as the blind man giving us a truly memorable and terrifying performance. the sound design is another key component to what makes this film work so well. every creak in the floor boards add to the already overwhelming tension. as I have already mentioned the film is very, very suspenseful. I am sure it will be enjoyed by many for years to come.<br/><br/>the verdict: 8.5/10"
"TheLlamaManStan","9","9","21","28 August 2016"," The Suspense Is High
","Wow. Ever since I first heard of the concept for Don't Breathe, I immediately knew it had potential. I am personally not familiar with most of the cast for this film. The director, Fede Alvarez, had apparently worked on the Evil Dead remake which was released a few years ago. I had not seen this film or any other projects that this director has worked on. Additionally, I was not familiarized with most of the cast. <br/><br/>Point being, I did not have much background on this film, except for perhaps the concept, and I was pleasantly surprised. The movie grips you from, literally, the very first scene, and keeps you in suspense until the very end. One thing I found interesting was how the film had various objects and symbols which were briefly shown near the beginning, and had a large impact in the movie later on. If you watch this movie, pay attention to the dog and hammer, for example.<br/><br/>The acting as well, was top notch. I was a bit skeptical, seeing that most of the actors did not have an extensive background in the industry (except for maybe the blind man). However, these actors played their parts perfectly, only adding to the already extremely suspenseful atmosphere of the movie. In fact, I'm not sure whether to call this film a horror or a thriller. In fact, I think it takes the best of both worlds, as the camera angles and tone make it feel like a horror, yet the plot and characters make it feel like a thriller.<br/><br/>The movie did have some notable goofs here and there. Since the atmosphere is so suspenseful, I seriously doubt that it will make a difference. But, they are there. Additionally, what bothered me the most about this movie was I felt that at one point, the movie became too violent and disturbing, in a way. You will definitely understand what part I am referring to when you come across it. In fact, I don't think this specific part was too physically violent or disturbing, I just believe that this violence, lets call it, was misplaced. This killed the suspenseful atmosphere of the film. <br/><br/>Apart from this, the movie was excellent. Definitely worth a watch, one of the best of 2016.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Don't Breathe is a different kind of movie in the home invasion genre because it actually follows those who invaded in the first place getting hunted. I have yet to see a movie like that so I found the beginning very enjoyable and was almost rooting for the ""Blind Guy."" That changed pretty quickly.<br/><br/>The movie is very intense and the editing in the movie is very well done. The way scenes/shots are set up are freaking great in my opinion. There were many moments I went back to watch the last few seconds again because it was such a well set up scene. Definitely the best thing about the movie.<br/><br/>Without getting into spoilers or anything, a lot is made clear towards the end of the movie but it still tries to stay relatively realistic even though the last 1/3rd of the movie doesn't feel like anything special.<br/><br/>Overall the movie as a whole is still very good with certain parts of it feeling perfect and then other parts, like the flow of scenes towards the end, lose the appeal and tension of the beginning by throwing in typical tropes."
"Troy_Campbell","8","5","10","8 September 2016"," An intelligent nail-biter.
","Receiving rave reviews from film-festival goers and critics alike, it doesn't take long to see why this under-the-radar horror-thriller has been amassing quite the fan base. Operating squarely within genre conventions, but at an extremely proficient level, this house-invasion flick builds tension masterfully. There are jump scares to be sure, however they're pulled off in a manner that isn't cheap thanks to their strategic placement. When our three young burglars break into a blind man's house during the night, it's not at all evident which route this movie is going to take. This base level of suspense is then escalated through a set of unpredictable twists and turns, cleverly playing with the audience's expectations. The violence is sparingly utilised and all the more effective for it, filmmaker Fede Alvarez (Evil Dead remake) wisely selecting to amp up the thrills with nerve-wracking anticipation rather than blood-splattering gore or unrelenting brutality. A long, Panic Room-esque one-shot tracking sequence displays Alvarez's immense talent behind the camera and his clear love of cinema, although he's also not above including one of the grossest on-screen moments in recent memory for utter shock value. The lead trio – Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto – are solid and likable without being completely excellent, whilst Stephen Lang manages a fine balance between being a menacing monster and a grieving father who is all too human. A couple of minor quibbles: the obtrusive score that doesn't seem to trust the sound design or visual framing to conjure up the requisite scares, and the hackneyed tropes employed in the opening act to establish the characters. Fast-paced, intelligently constructed and suitably tense, the aptly titled Don't Breathe is a nail-biting delight."

","Don't Breath is the summer movie surprise, so far, this year. Don't Breath started out weak. What did not work with Don't breath, at the begging was all the characters where scummy and unlikable. The other part of the beginning which I found hard to fathom is how the blind guy survive an attack by three people? Surprisingly, the movie improves when the blind man turns the light out in his house. The blind man has the advantage in the dark. In the dark, the viewer finds out how deranged the old blind man is. A instinctive primal fear of the dark sets in for rest of the film. As the robbers try to escape the house they find out what the blind man is hiding and will never let the robbers live. As the story unfolds, there is disturbing images and scenes. The ending is cold as the decaying as Detroit neighborhood surroundings. 7 stars. The makers leave room for part 2."

What I found to be really good is that some scenes and twists were really unexpected ( I don't want to spoil it ) but if you do see the movie, which I highly recommend, you would understand.<br/><br/>The ending also offers space for a sequel, which I hope they do not ruin ( if it happens ). <br/><br/>Go check out the movie, I personally found it to be very good and somewhat original. Final Verdict : 9/10"
"tjgoalie13","8","5","10","30 August 2016"," Suspenseful and Clever, Despite a Few Plot Holes
","In a year with a string of impressive horror films, Don't Breathe is yet another good entry. Directed by Fede Alvarez (Evil Dead, 2013), this film shows that he has a talent for horror, and may be a rising presence in the genre. Don't Breathe is hold-your-breath scary, and features a clever premise, despite a few small plot holes. It is worth mentioning that the title and posters seemed a little ambiguous as to the plot, but watching the film the title seems appropriate.<br/><br/>The first thing to mention about this film is that it is full of twists and turns, but does take a relatively practical approach to it's plot. The film's story is very smartly constructed, as it is full of tension from the opening moments, right up to the end. The film's biggest strength is its simplicity, as it makes the most of a very straightforward premise. That being said, the film is constructed in a way that obstacles are consistently thrown at the main characters in creative ways.<br/><br/>Simply put the fact that the writers and directors were able to tell a story with such a clever yet simple premise makes it easy to follow. The impressive thing about this film is within a short period of time, the characters are well established and the premise, which is quite clever, is introduced. With all of the clichéd horror films today, putting empty characters in clichéd situations, it's refreshing to see relatable characters put into a straightforward premise. However, as happens in all horror films, the characters find everything is not as they expected it, and quickly discover they're in over their heads.<br/><br/>The only problem with the film, is that it does cater to a few too many horror clichés and has a few glaring plot holes. While the obstacles in this film are creatively thrown at the main characters, a few of them don't make sense, with a little thought. The story at times, neglects to explain how something happened, and relies on a few Deus ex Machinas. The irony is that many of the plot holes, end up helping the villain character, as he seems almost inhuman by the end of the film. In the end, Don't Breathe does a brilliant job keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, with a combination of ingenuity and simplicity. The film offers a refreshing entry in the horror genre, which has seen a nice revival this year, from the typically clichéd horror films we get. The film isn't great, as it has a few too many plot holes, and clichés, but is still very entertaining. Horror buffs looking for a good film to get them into the Fall/Halloween season will likely enjoy this film."
"WildWombatt","8","5","10","27 August 2016"," Intense Thriller
","At the end of the day, this movie did its job for its genre as a thriller. It was entertaining, captivating, and there were no dull moments for this film. <br/><br/>Most movies tend to start out really slow or have a slow burning effect, but Don't Breathe held an air of suspense for the majority of its screen time. The characters were great for this film; the movie did a good job of introducing the characters and giving you snippets of some of the motives and types of people they were. Stephen Lang was an amazing choice to play the old man. I couldn't help but feel a little bad for the blind man at the beginning, but the more you see him in action and learn about him, the more dangerous and scary he appears.<br/><br/>As with most horror and thriller movies, the storyline was not extraordinary or totally unique, but, it's an intense movie that was very gripping and kept you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The only flaw of this movie were some obvious ""smarter"" choices the characters could of made, but for the most part, there were't many times where I was bothered by their decisions - considering the situation they're stuck in.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the story was okay, the set-up was okay. Most of the elements were just decent, but it was how they used everything and executed them for this film, creating a thrilling and gripping movie. It's fun and entertaining, and if you enjoy suspenseful films, definitely give it a watch!"

"Leofwine_draca","4","3","5","29 June 2018"," Left me cold
","DON'T BREATHE is a well-regarded horror film of 2016, but I'm afraid I found it rather overblown and predictable. The plot, which sees a team of burglars breaking into the house of an old blind man who turns out to be rather less than innocent, was already done previously in THE COLLECTOR and THE COLLECTION and this adds little more to the story. The protagonists of the film are all young, grungy and unlikeable, so there's not much involvement there, and the one saving grace is another fine performance from Stephen Lang as the antagonist of the hour. Elsewhere, it's the usual chasing around in the dark, with cliched scares and plot development and a general hackneyed, seen-it-all-before feel."
"Saucy_Jacky","2","9","23","27 August 2016"," A brilliant example of potential forsaken for the familiarity of conventional horror tropes.
","The greatest, and most unfortunate, aspect of this film is that it held an immense amount of POTENTIAL to be something both refreshing and memorable. <br/><br/>It did not, however, deliver upon that potential.<br/><br/>Whilst the outset of the film succeeds in positing to the viewer the idea that the retribution delivered unto the thieving teenage protagonists is justified, it soon transforms its own grey area into yet another example of a black-and-white, ""flawed-but-decent guys vs. abjectly-bad guys"" scenario. We have experienced this countless times before in horror films, and to be faced with it once more after having had fostered hope for something more thought-provoking is, at the very least, disappointing. <br/><br/>The plot itself, while perhaps more original than the majority of horror films to have been released within the past decade, is riddled with holes whose explication would require spoiling the film but whose presence is undeniable to those who have seen it. Each and every cinematic work features plot holes, as individual and collective oversight is a common human malady, and therefore most movies are to be forgiven for them; however, this particular film created plot holes of such depth and magnitude that the viewer is continually expulsed from suspension of disbelief and is made instead to laugh at the ridiculousness and sheer magnitude of the various instances of utter implausibility. <br/><br/>The film overall is so dependent upon traditional horror tropes that each and every aspect within it is predictable and familiar; there are no scenes which are surprising nor unexpected, and the ending is likewise tired.<br/><br/>There are not enough redeeming qualities within the film to warrant paying for a ticket; even to use a theatre-rewards-specific free pass would be a waste. You are better off watching other recent and acclaimed horror films, such as ""It Follows,"" ""The Witch,"" or ""The Conjuring."" <br/><br/>This particular film earns at most a 2/10, and is worthy of nothing greater than perhaps a Redbox rental for a Halloween horror film marathon."
"ctowyi","7","7","17","25 August 2016"," Horror has a new name!
","The power of a film's opening establishing shot cannot be under-estimated. If done well it will pull the viewer in and the storytelling becomes an easier job. One of my favourite opening shots hails from Highlander (1986). It has that curious gaze on a scene of mayhem that breathes with unusual counterpoints. It is hypnotising, beguiling, almost surreal, as you try to make sense of it. However I can't say the rest of the film did that clever opening scene any justice. Don't Breathe, on the other hand, has none of these issues. It opens with a scene that feels weirdly out of place but yet has a visceral and realistic quality about it. Questions whizzed through my mind as I silently prayed that the journey of discovery be a rewarding one. It is. Oh my... It fricking is. <br/><br/>Uruguayan writer/director Fede Alvarez's debut is a remake of Evil Dead (1981) called.... ahem.... Evil Dead (2013). It is loud, deafening and pours a swimming pool of blood all over you because he thinks more is good. His sophomore effort Don't Breathe is quieter, superbly lo-fi and the scares hit a lot harder. Running at 88 minutes, this is one lean, mean, crackerjack of a movie. Nary a scene is wasted. It resembles Netflix's Hush a lot in the sense that it is a home invasion psychological horror film and the homeowner is physically impaired. In the excellent Hush, the female victim is a deaf mute, while in Don't Breathe we get a blind man. But mark this, the similarities end there. Hush is a straight up thriller and we can easily root for the victim and celebrate her clever one-ups against the psychopath. In Don't Breathe we don't get that luxury and our sympathies for each character will sway across the board. There is an air of unpredictability permeating throughout the movie and the tension slowly rams up to dizzying hair-pulling levels. There are some inventive scenes that press the ""genre refresh"" button and if you have been watching as many of these genre flicks as I have, that is something quite rare. <br/><br/>The best character here is definitely The Blind Man played devilishly well by Stephen Lang. His dialogue is very spare but when it comes it will send a shiver down your spine. He is feral, doesn't listen to desperate cries of mercy and is a force of primal nature. Being blind means naught to him because he knows the lay of his house like the back of his massive hand. The battleground is his playground. You can go in but you can't get out. At a certain point we discover a sickening secret about him and it is such an uncomfortable eye-popping moment. But yet it is a powerful scene because I started to pity his heartbreaking desperation. Lang has brought his A game and it is a character that will haunt me for a long time. <br/><br/>The cinematography is fluid and really brings out the claustrophobic feel of pure terror. Alvarez has delivered a thoroughly satisfying genre horror flick that is definitely not derivative. Evil Dead (2013) is forgotten. Don't Breathe is Alvarez's new first horror film. Horror has a new name. Remember his name."

His girl is a kindhearted but misguided type. She has an unrequited love interest in the third wheel of the group. Of course this character is the brains of the operation. The blind guy who is being robbed is Dare Devil like in his abilities to fight and move about his house. The blind man's back story is another cliché. He suffers the loss of his child and then imprisons the women responsible for her death. The fact this women is even in the movie doesn't add anything to the story. Overall just a bad movie and one to avoid."
"coreyjdenford","8","4","8","9 September 2016"," Turning Blue
","This is my review of Don't Breathe (spoiler free)<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>Lately, there has been a cycle of home invasion movies having a vulnerable protagonist – for example the deaf heroine in Hush, the agoraphobic of Shut In (a.k.a Intruders) – turning the table on murderous, larcenous thugs. Don't Breathe takes a slightly different tack on this premise, focusing on three varied crooks – an unstable bad boy who provides all the jobs, Money (Daniel Zovatto) a girl who need money to escape her not-so-happy home life, Rocky (Jane Levy) and a basically decent guy with a crush (Dylan Minnette) – they all make the mistake of targeting a grizzly tough ex-combat soldier (Stephen Lang) as their last target. Although influenced by many home invasion movies clashing regular criminals trying to make an extra bit of money with a contemporary maniac (No One Live, The Neighbour, The Collector). Although having dashed off the competent, not-so-memorable Evil Dead remake, Uruguayan writer/director Fede Alvarez doesn't exactly go all-out to break new ground with this 'original' – but he demonstrate the understanding of how this sort of suspense picture works. Making revelations every ten minutes, but as the more perilous and extreme moments come in there is a genuine element of terror and a thrill that will be memorable for any audience. Through the 88 minutes it adds terror, thrills, suspense and a memorable antagonist who is a lot more proficient, and less vulnerable than the young crooks last thought.<br/><br/>The scarce use of dialogue isn't exactly worth while as there isn't much to go on when it comes to character development (spoken term) but as the story goes on turns out we don't need it as the slow and creepy editing style adds to the dark feel of the film, as we are constantly on edge as the element of threat gets stronger. One of the editing styles adds a night vision shot at one point and zooms it in really close to one of the invaders, so as you see their scared face it will increase the tension that this story was already full of. So in terms of story its limited but certainly makes up for it, not really classed as a go-for-broke horror as there are a few jump scares not really taking over the sheer threat of having a blind combat proficient man chase after you. Although this could be shown as a message for home invaders. The story is filled with constant suspense as the three thieves try to escape the blind man's home, although what they don't expect is that the Blind Man already has a plan for the thieves. That gives the thieves an idea, but as the story goes on in the main set-up inside the house he's not as paranoid as they thought, in fact, far from it. As stated above the jump scares are limited kind of strong however the feeling of suspense adds to the scares. Filmed practically it shows there is no need for special effects pizazz as some horrors try adding to make the story scarier, however it really wasn't needed in this as this antagonist and the dark atmosphere add enough horror. <br/><br/>Also the feeling of claustrophobia is shown as one of the characters is in a tight confined space in a moment which will have you constantly on edge just many other characters in movies that have to deal with tight spaces, this is more towards the terrifying denouement which we'll get to later. There is a sense of shock in one of the scenes as the thieves discover which they did not expect and it adds a sense of imprisonment which is the whole theme of the film, but when it gets to this bit it is a very memorable moment which the audience will remember until well after the credits roll. It shows prolonging sense of agony. All this including the thrill are all made the bit creepier with Roque Banos' foreboding score which will send a shiver right down your spine. Each time this adds the feeling of every time one or the other robbers has a chance to get away clean, something pulls them back whether they creak a floorboard or even break some glass the antagonist gets ever closer to catching you. <br/><br/>Finally as we all know at the end of a horror film in this case home invasion film the terror gets more fast paced, but in this not only is the terror nearly taking over the entire film there are also some feel good bits. But also as we get closer to the end the last act subjects the girl to a ferocious, slobbering guard dog, a padded basement dungeon (with a suspension harness) and a shocking home medical procedure. Although Lang, is an underrated character best known for his good-guy-cum-villain-cum-hard-to-kill-guy in Avatar, he is a powerful, menacing presence that also manages a little bit of pathos as we start to feel sorry for him as he is the real victim because we learn that he has lost everything he knows/loves and he preaches that there is no God because he took away the things he knew, so essentially he has nobody and he just wants to be left alone that is the message that this sends.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Alvarez gives full blown suspense, terror and darkness in an original escapee horror that will make you struggle for every last breath.<br/><br/>8/10 terrifying."

Like 10 Cloverfield Lane earlier this year, it knows it's basically a B-flick in every sense of the word and Fede Alvarez runs away with it. The film never actually turns into a comedy horror film because it's never that obvious, and yet you can sense the filmmakers laughing with glee while making it. The filming and directing itself is really well done. Although it doesn't hit the the genre highs that Green Room (a film that is also similar in its frenzied and feverish pacing and narrative) hit, it still does so much justice to this genre.

","This film, while not a cinematic masterpiece, blends an absolutely genius concept with masterful directing, giving audiences an extremely gripping thriller that never gets tired or old. Straying from the ""useless jump scare"" trend that seems to be sweeping Hollywood and now even indie horror films, ""Don't Breathe"" manages to create an extremely tense atmosphere using effective sound design and highly motivated camera-work and composition in each shot. The emotionally motivated direction of each shot allows the film to create a sense of unease, adding another layer to it's visual style and keeping viewers petrified. <br/><br/>Although the film showcases an array of young acting talent, Sephen Lang's portrayal of ""the blind man"" is totally unique and completely silent, creating one of the most terrifying characters put on film in the last few years. The entire physicality and beaten look of the character manage to literally take your breath away, as you endure the silent suspense that director Fede Alverez puts you through. If you are a fan of horror, thrillers or even just clever, original filmmaking, this film is a must see!"

","I saw ""Don't Breathe"", starring Stephen Lang-Avatar, Tombstone; Jane Levy-Evil Dead_2013, Suburgatory_tv; Dylan Minnette-Goosebumps, Let Me In and Daniel Zovatto-Fear The Walking Dead_tv, It Follows.<br/><br/>This is not your typical thriller/horror movie. It has twists that might catch you off guard-it did me-and you are not really sure who you should be rooting for as the good guy or the bad guy. Stephen is a Gulf War vet that was blinded in battle. After coming home to the states, his daughter is killed by a drunk rich girl-who gets off with no jail time, since she is rich-but he does get a large settlement from the rich parents. Jane, Dylan and Daniel are a group of teens that spend their spare time burglarizing houses and taking whatever they want. You see, Dylan's father works for a home security company so Dylan has access to keys and codes. They hear about Stephen's little windfall and decide to hit him, thinking, what trouble can a blind man be? Plus, the house is in a bad, rundown neighborhood with few neighbors. Boy, are they wrong. It seems that old Stephen might just have a few tricks-as well as secrets-up his sleeve. Concerning what I mentioned earlier about who to root for, do you hope the kids rob a blind war vet or do you hope a physically fit war vet with Daredevil type senses defends his property? But then, what if the war vet takes things too far? Is it justified? It is a dilemma. It's rated ""R"" for violence, terror, disturbing content, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 28 minutes. I loved it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

"moviemanMA","8","6","14","26 August 2016"," Don't mess with the blind man
","Don't Breathe is a tight, thriller that doesn't let up. There were several parts of the film where I was convinced we were nearing the end, only to be grabbed by the throat and dragged back in. Three young criminals are trying to get out of Detroit and onto bigger and better things. In order to do so they need cash, and lots of it. After receiving information on a potential big score, the group decides to go for it. The target is a blind, Iraq War veteran who is rumored to have $300,000 somewhere in his house. What looks like a cake walk turns into a nightmarish game of cat and mouse that will leave you truly holding your breath until the very end.<br/><br/>Alvarez reunites with Jane Levy, his leading lady from Evil Dead. Levy really wowed me in that film and I was excited to see her in a new role with new scares. While some actors are remembered for their screams in horror films, it's Levy's eyes that stand out. They convey so much emotion, and given that a good amount of this film requires her character to remain silent, she pulls it off brilliantly. Accompanying Levy is veteran actor Stephen Lang as The Blind Man. Lang's screen and stage presence is well documented in productions like Gettysburg, Avatar, and as Col. Jessup in the original stage production of A Few Good Men. His intimidating physique makes him the perfect choice to play this role.<br/><br/>Alvarez assembled a great team of actors, but his best selection might have been behind the camera with cinematographer Pedro Luque. He was the cinematographer for La Casa Muda, (The Silent House) a film that almost doesn't deserve the genius camera-work from Luque. He shot the film to appear like one continuous take and the result is truly unique. He didn't disappoint here either with some great tracking shots and an unforgettable chase scene in the basement.<br/><br/>Luque's images are made even creepier thanks to brilliant sound design. Sound ups are common in horror films, and there are plenty to jump at in this film. While those work great they can be tiresome. I prefer the quiet moments. The shuffling of feet, creaking floor boards, and muffled breathing not only intensify the mood, they force the viewer to fill in the silence with their own imagination. It's like when you here something in your own home and you don't know what it is. You run through every possible scenario until you find the source.<br/><br/>When the credits starting rolling I felt like I myself had spent the night in the house. With a run time of just under 90 minutes, they really jam packed every second of it. While the dialogue isn't anything to write home about (especially the first act), it doesn't detract from the story (I watch for scares, not for the conversations). A fine job all around and hopefully just the beginning of a long career for Alvarez. With two big films under his belt already, I can't wait to see what he has in store for us next!"

","DON'T BREATHE is a wonderfully shot, well-paced, and well-performed crime thriller, with sorely underrated character actor Stephen Lang turning another terrific performance as The Blind Man. I was ready to believe that its biggest flaw was an ill-fitting title (guys, come on, you could have done much better than ""Don't Speak""; it almost made me skip it as another lame horror film). The plot was unique enough to reel me in: a trio of home invaders getting the tables turned on them when they try to rob an old blind man. Much of the movie is done so well that I don't need to elaborate here; I'll just say it's worth seeing, but I'll offer up its central flaw as a caveat: Ironically, the filmmakers seem to suffer from a blind spot of their own by confusing who we are meant to root for with who we should root for, and why.<br/><br/>""Rocky"", the would-be heroine, keeps nice-guy Alex in the friend zone while she and her wanna-be gangster boyfriend ""Money"" (really?) use Alex to burglarize homes. Their spree is made possible by Alex's dad working for a home security company that installs the alarms of the places they burgle, or something like that. The problem is Rocky, who is uninteresting and a bit of an a-hole, yet we're intended to root for her.<br/><br/>Strike One is Rocky taking advantage of Alex. Rocky has no redeeming qualities, so the only apparent reason Alex likes her is that she's hot. Knowing this, the morally bankrupt Rocky is able to play the sap like a fiddle, easily bending him to her will and immediately making her not very root-able for. The viewer is meant to sympathize with Rocky purely on the merit of her having a crappy family home, a crappy mom, etc., as if her unfortunate situation makes her a lovable hero, not, you know, her actions or personality. Or I suppose that, like Alex, we're intended to sympathize with her just because she's hot. Oh, wait...she has a kid. A daughter named ""Diddy"" for some reason that goes unexplained. I almost forgot since Diddy is only there as part of the scenery for one scene. That's why we should care, because she's doing it for her kid's life not to suck. Sure (ahem). <br/><br/>Even if so, why does Alex have to risk his life and his dad's job and reputation for her effing kid? When Alex opts out of this job stating those reasons, Rocky gives no Fs about that. That sweet life she's dreaming of with her crappy boyfriend will be made on Alex's bones, if need be. She actually tells him that once they're done, it's 'Sayonara, buddy'. But when Rocky says please, the sap is all in, cause hey...maybe someday she'll realize what a swell guy he is and what a jerk her thug boyfriend is. <br/><br/>:|<br/><br/>The Blind Man's backstory is his daughter was killed in a hit-and- run, producing his large settlement. We soon find out that the driver who committed the manslaughter got away with it, and she's now chained up in The Blind Man's gilded cage, barefoot 'n pregnant (literally) with his replacement baby via turkey baster insemination. (I'm not positive but I think we're supposed to overlook the fact that she took a life and got away with it.) After Rocky and Alex's shenanigans cause the death of the kidnapped woman, The Blind Man ultimately captures and tries to inseminate Rocky to replace the lost child. Alex miraculously survives the sweet embrace of death so that he can rescue Rocky from Karmic Recompense. Again, this sap will do anything for a girl who gives no shits about him, including moving away from the light to save her. <br/><br/>Leading us to Strike Two:<br/><br/>When she's free, Rocky gets her licks in on The Blind Man for trying to violate her. Yay, physical aggression = feminism! (Except that she had to be rescued by a man, which I've been told is very anti-feminist in a narrative.) ANYWAY...this is meant to be Big Cheer moment for the heroine of the story for having triumphed over the evil of nearly being violated...except for the tiny problem of SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN THAT SITUATION TO BEGIN WITH IF SHE WASN'T TRYING TO ROB THE GUY. The issue here is culpability (or, in the parlance of our times, ""victim blaming""). Now one could argue that home invasion/robbery is a ""victimless"" crime, or at least isn't nearly as high on the moral depravity scale as a forced insemination violation...but does Rocky bear no part of the blame for her fate, even if plotting to rip off a blind man is what got her into this predicament? If we say that Money 'had it coming to him' when getting his brains blown out by The Blind Man, doesn't that imply that Rocky had it coming, too? Maybe not, but regardless, we're meant to applaud her striking back. Against the blind guy she was trying to rob.<br/><br/>:|<br/><br/>Don't be misled by my raking the movie over the coals a bit. If it were a hopeless piece of crap film, I wouldn't care, but it was good enough to wish it was better. So despite that the moral center of the film is horribly imbalanced, it certainly has enough going for it to be entertaining, IMO. Give it a shot, maybe you'll like DON'T BREATHE more than I did. A note to the filmmakers, though, for your next flick: by default, the audience roots for the guy seeking justice and protecting himself, not for the a-hole characters who killed his kid and trying to rob him. You'd do well to write your story accordingly."

But that's where the film wins over you.
It all feels credible and that's thanks to a very clever direction by Fede Alvarez.
Stephen Lang who plays the blind man is very very good and so are Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette who play the robbers.

"jayjaycee","7","1","1","4 May 2020"," Alvarez made some things you won't see coming...
","""Don't Breathe"" is a 2016 horror thriller directed by Fede Alvarez starring Jane Levy and Stephen Lang. In the first few minutes I was bothering my head about where I know the lead actress from and after I could not find a solution to my overthinking, I paused it and had to look it up. After this short break I found out that I knew her from ""Evil Dead"" and furthermore realised that this film was produced by the team behind said remake (e.g. Sam Raimi) and even was directed by the same director as well. Then I knew I was in for something for some hard stuff. Surprisingly, this film is the total opposite of the gore fest that the remake is and went into a more realistic and thriller type of horror film instead. Afterwards I learned that Alvarez came up with the idea for this film on the basis of the heavy criticism he received for his previous feature, mostly for the fact that he allegedly used only gallons of blood to shock the audience. Therefore he came up with the idea for this film and I think he successfully proved that he is capable of doing something completely different as well. The film's concept is basically simple: Teenagers break into an old man's house to steal his hidden fortune. Sounds simple? It is, but one may justifiably ask: How does the horror come into the picture then? The horror in this case is something you will not see coming at all. I wasn't either. I was mildly underwhelmed but simultaneously heavily impressed that the film passed on using any form of paranormal or supernatural horror and approaches its premise with extreme realism instead. It is mostly created by the haunting tension and the characters' constant fear of getting caught that also gradually begins to infest the viewer as well. All of this happens due to the development of both the characters and the story. Speaking of which, the main characters are one of the main reasons of this movie's success, because you can't really tell who plays what role. The three burglars might be the apparent protagonists of the film, but there are some major reasons that make it extremely hard to consider them the heroes of the story. Even though their motivation to rob a man is the simple desire to leave their hometown of Detroit and especially their dysfunctional families and start a new life from the money they are hoping to heist, it doesn't change the fact that they are illegally stealing from a blind, old war veteran who received the money as a settlement from people who killed his only beloved daughter in a car accident. Thus, the definition of who is the hero and who is the villain is in limbo in the beginning and I think how it deals with this question in the process is one of the film's most brilliant aspects. It is undeniable that the actions of Rocky and company are morally questionable and are obviously not the right solution for their problem, but it is hard to judge them completely, given their current troubled life situation. In a weird way it makes them authentic and human. Except for that complete moron Money, I felt extreme sympathy for both Rocky and Alex. The same applies to the blind man with no mentioned name. Imagine you served your country and return scarred and marked from combat and the only real joy in your life is the close relationship to your only daughter who eventually dies in a car accident and the only thing that is supposed to compensate her life is an enormous amount of money. Just imagine that is what is left of your miserable life and then some greedy teenagers try to steal that from you as well. Wouldn't you be upset about this as well? As written in stone as it may sound, the film ingeniously manages to let this conception crumble with enough shocking twists and your perception about all the characters shifts immensely in the process. The story is another of the film's biggest advantages. Despite the absence of any paranormal threat, it definitely doesn't lack the tension that is needed in this kind of movie and it undoubtedly takes a lot of creativity to create a certain suspense in such a limited setting all the while trying to stay true to the intended realism. The outcome is without a doubt appreciable. What I feared to see was the lack of inventiveness, but this film fortunately is anything but repetitive (except for a few aspects) and hauntingly rich in variety and thus offers a lot of innovation for this genre. Another thing that makes this film differ from other entries it is how it allows the threat to only creep in slowly. In the beginning I was thinking ""What kind of damage might a blind and old man probably do to three healthy teenagers with a gun?"" and it shocked me what this man could do despite of his disadvantage. Not only does he have a canine companion that does a lot of work for him, the house the three trespassers are trapped in is still his own territory after all. He learned to live in it despite his missing vision. Just like our protagonist I underestimated his hidden abilities and thus he is an actual threat. The film mostly follows Rocky, superbly portrayed by Jane Levy, and focuses on her as she tries to remain silent and find a way out of the death trap. Like in her first collaboration with Alvarez, she is one of the main factors why this film works out so well. Once again, she shows how talented she is and especially masters the eye game again. Her performance impressively captures the silent terror of this flick and thus brings the horror into effect, in other words, it made me hold my breath for most of the runtime. In the following sequences her fight for survival is the focus and there are several ideas incorporated that exacerbate the whole situation tremendously. Just before you thought she is on the brink of finally escaping her certain death there is something else that thwarts her flight and traps her even more in the house. It is not only the whole atmosphere, but also the antagonist that heavily reminded me of ""Resident Evil 7"" and gave me similar vibes. In some instances, it was sadly predictable and kept me from being surprised, but aside from this it had enough unforeseen features that made it up for it (two words: night vision!). Next to the striking resemblance to the 2017 Koshi Nakanishi game it also pays tribute to classic horror films, such as ""Cujo"" (obviously) and supposedly even ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" (can't tell it in the case of the latter, still have to see it), but allegedly the final reveal is not inferior to the Johnathan Demme classic in terms of how disturbing it is. The blind man keeping the girl who killed his daughter as a hostage and forcing her to bear him a new child? Whatever the director was smoking lead him to a decision that is nothing short of absolutely gross and had an unsettling effect on me. The fact that his behaviour and desperate measures made sense in an insane way didn't make it easier for me. With this devastating realization the movie gains even more tension, as the inconspicuous and innocent man turns out to be an even more dangerous and indescribably threatening maniac. Until the end, he doesn't seem to be willing to stop until he is getting what he desires. Even after the bloodcurdling final act where is defeated and presumably dead, he turns out to be still alive. That leaves me wondering if he is human or actually not something more instead. Another thing I consider to be remarkable is how Rocky managed to escape with the stolen money and starts a new life on a undeniably nefarious basis. Stolen money remains to be stolen money, no matter what kind of pervert is the legitimate owner. It is interesting how the finale subtly establishes her as an antihero and convicts neither the protagonist nor the antagonist for their felonies and thus places both on the same level. Just a small detail, but not less brilliant. All in all, this flick is a surprisingly innovative and intense thriller that establishes its horror with a realistic approach and passes on paranormal factor completely. Admittedly, the film did not impress that much shortly after the credits have rolled, but the more I thought about it the more I was able to take in the ingeniousness that lies out of sight but in hidden details. Furthermore, I enjoyed the character constellation and the personalities behind each and everyone and consider Jane Levy's performance to be a critical factor for this film's success (aside from the dog who is the real MVP) and it makes me kind of sad that she is not starring in any bigger films. In my opinion, she absolutely deserves more recognition. This film is without a doubt original, innovative, and packing, in other words everything a movie of that genre needs. It was indeed a creative venture, but it eventually pays off, as it turns out to be something of its own. Oh, and before I forget: Now that I have seen both Levy/Alvarez collaborations and felt strong ""Resident Evil"" vibes in both, I think it would be a perfect job for him to make a proper adaptation with Levy in the leading role, as she would make an ideal Jill Valentine. With Raimi as the producer, a man who is experienced in this genre and a talented and charismatic lead actress, what could go wrong then? It surely could not be worse than the Anderson abominations. Just saying. Anyway, this film might not be ground-breaking, but is a surprisingly entertaining and decent thriller."

","From writer/director Fred Alvarez, Don't Breathe is his second feature film. He is quickly gaining a name for himself in horror circles, but I'm not personally convinced it is for the right reasons. His first feature which he also both wrote and directed was the Evil Dead remake, which as a huge fan of the original I was not terribly impressed with despite its plaudits (and you should already be aware of my opinion of pointless remakes). The modern generation really need to start watching films made before the year two thousand.<br/><br/>Anyway, in the slums of Detroit, some loser, no-hope kids are getting easy scores by breaking into posh houses. It's easy money for the serial thieves/thrill seekers as one of them has master keys as their targets all use his fathers security company. Convenient huh? And no, not a one of them thinks that eventually it might look a little suspicious. Whatever, moving on. Each one has a sob-story to tell in order to try and make them a little more likeable. Bottom line is, they are dumb waster kids. We don't really care.<br/><br/>They get word of an army vet who got a big settlement after an accident involving his daughter. While scouting out the house they realise that their target is blind and decide to hit the house that night thinking it will be simple as, simple be. Unfortunately for them (or fortunately for us), this is one blind army vet who doesn't take being robbed lying down and retaliates with force. That night the kids break in, disable the alarm and then everything starts to go south for them.<br/><br/>I will say the film is actually quite entertaining and Stephen Lang (Avatar) as the blind man is certainly the star of the show. He really is menacing and creepy and you're quite happy for him to be dispatching dumb idiot teenagers. The rest of the acting is reasonable but nothing to shout out about. There is also some great atmosphere building along with some good camera effects. The lighting and sound are also above average when so many recent films can't even get these two simple things right. So a major plus there for this feature.<br/><br/>To sum up, Don't Breathe is an entertaining and surprisingly well made film with high production values. Despite its rather hysterically positive reception (maybe some folk just don't watch a lot of films), it is ultimately full of the usual old and tired horror cliches which does let the film down. Despite it doing what it does very well, there is nothing really new here on offer but should ultimately satisfy you. Certainly one of the better films of this type.<br/><br/>

And as they were thinking that they will walk away easily with all the money, the blind man does not think the same way.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because it had a very interesting plot with many twists and because of the very well-written script. I also believe that the direction which was made by Fede Alvarez was simply amazing and his beautiful work it can be easily understood in the whole duration of this film. I liked a lot the interpretation of Stephen Lang who played The Blind Man and he simply nailed his role. Other good interpretations were Jane Levy's who played Rocky and Dylan Minnette who played Alex. The best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of suspense and an interesting plot which combination of both is the key for a good movie.<br/><br/>Finally, I believe that ""Don't Breathe"" is a good horror movie with plenty of suspense and many twists that will keep you alert for the whole duration of it. I also think that you aren't going to waste your time watching it. I recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much since it's something different from all the other horror movies that you have ever watched."

","The overall plot is pretty simple and the sub plot while only are review after one-third of the movie, is still predictable. However, this absolute masterpiece is based on masterful suspension with a dark theme. It will keep you tense through the whole movie. However, the director is skillful in controlling the paced, not falling into the chasm of movies such as BvS since the story is so simple you won't have to wonder why. Moreover, viewers never know what, when and where the villain may strike thanks to the way every shot is calculated and placed at near perfection. The only thing I felt out of tune is the ending scene, while somewhat satisfying, is far too bland for a movie this dark and messed up The intensity of the film is so overwhelming that while the soundtrack does not reach the desirable bar, nobody even notices it. Every character developed their personality mostly through action rather then words ( which is rare in this movie ) and yet still make the audience feel related and make the movie darker at the same time. A thriller, yet is probably one of those few classic that crosses over to the territory of Horror genre with this kind of fast-paced tension."

","A wild ride from beginning to end. To start off, and nothing is revealed here, there are no good guys in this story. As witnessed in the trailers, we are watching three thieves and a man with a dark secret (via locked up girl in the basement seen in the trailer). As an audience, we get pulled in all kinds of directions to find a side to pick throughout the film and this was awesome for me... There are no brakes applied to the ""thriller"" concept of this film. This one is intense and violent from the get go and it presents frequent ""wtf"" moments over and over... Beyond the story and elements of the film, I have to give appreciation to the cinematography, score, and sound effects (or lack of). The film places the audience in a state of suspense with the way it goes completely silent and, at times, only allows the sound of light breathing come through the speakers. Creating an absolutely chilling experience.<br/><br/>One of the best films of the year for me. Suspenseful and chilling from beginning to end. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>--Oberrated--"

","Sometimes the most simple premise can turn into one tense cinematic experience, and although Don't Breathe could have gone either way in the quality stakes, it makes for one of the most intense trips to the cinema you'll have this year.<br/><br/>Despite the fact it goes on its head in the final third....<br/><br/>Rocky, a young woman wanting to start a better life for her and her sister in California, begs her best friend Alex to take part in the robbery of a house owned by a wealthy blind man with her boyfriend Money. <br/><br/>But when the blind man turns out to be a more than he seems, the group must find a way to escape his home before they become his newest victims.<br/><br/>I had my preconceptions about this film, after all, it's from the director of the abysmal Evil Dead remake, and just of late, Raimi has let himself down in the producer stakes (I'm still trying to forget that dreadful Poltergeist remake).<br/><br/>But it was an interesting premise, and the trailer made it look like a hybrid of Panic room and the final ten minutes of Silence Of The Lambs.<br/><br/>But the main reason why the film works so well is because it doesn't mess around getting to the reason we are paying to see the movie. It isn't on for more than twenty minutes when we are in the blind mans house.<br/><br/>And that's the location for the rest of the film. And it's not a house of horrors like some films would contain. Nope, it's just a man with a very particular set of skills, hunting down people who are trying to take from him.<br/><br/>So who is the hero and villain of the piece? Are we supposed to show empathy for Rocky because her mother gave her such a bad childhood? She's a criminal plain and simple, and no matter the reasons for her crimes, it's still the wrong thing to do.<br/><br/>This is probably why the film takes a turn for the more sinister in the third act, after all, the makers can't have us rooting for 'The Boogeyman' of the piece. If this added element wasn't added, he would just be a person protecting his property.<br/><br/>And at one point, the film literally made me heave, thanks to a simple kitchen utensil you use to baste things with (and I'm pretty tolerant with all things gross).<br/><br/>My only complaint was that it does that stupid trick of lingering on an object for too long and basically saying to the audience ""Hey Kids!!! Remember this item, because you can bet your bottom dollar it'll be used later at a crucial moment"".<br/><br/>But other than that, it's the most fun I've had at the cinema this year."

There's no monsters, aliens,weird looking humans, or zombies. Its a thriller and a damn good one. The character build up is quite good.But once we get into the meat of the story after about 15 min. in, the tension is non stop. I won't go into details but they're easy enough to find here and on you tube but suffice it to say these kids haven't got a clue what they've got themselves into. Fede Alvarez did a great job on the whole movie with the tension but especially the ending(s).

"romessanadeem","4","5","12","5 September 2016"," Don't Hold Your Breath
","Don't Breathe is a film with one of the most interesting premises I've heard recently. A trio of small time thieves, Rocky, Alex and Money (I didn't come up with these names. Don't look at me) try to burgle an old blind man's house on the chance that he's keeping his inherited 300000$ hoarded somewhere inside. The Blind Guy is not entirely hospitable to the thieves who tried to gas and rob him and he quickly is revealed to be something out of a Quentin Tarantino movie. The trailer looked absolutely riveting, a surefire 1.5 hours of thrilling suspense. As it turns out though, Don't Breathe is as suspenseful as a piece of soggy bread.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe tries to create moments of tension and suspense and they work at times, very occasionally. But sadly the best moments, like the minor ""plot twist"" and a death scene, were revealed in the trailer. It's just another example of trailers showing too much too soon, much to the expense of the quality and effectiveness of the movie itself. Scenes that could have amounted to genuine nail- biting-edge-of-the-seat trembling were further dampened by the absolute idiocy of our three main leads. Rocky (Jane Levy) is given the most clichéd backstory you can think of. Money (Daniel Zovatto) tries to have a cool ghetto backstory but he's as ghetto as Iggy Azalea. And Alex (Dylan Minette) despite seeming like a well off kid likes to go around breaking and entering into houses with Rocky and Money. It's like the writers were trying to say, ""They don't actually STEAL and don't use weapons. Now EMPATHIZE"" But who are the bad guys in this movie? The blind guy? The lead characters? Their parents for naming them things like Rocky and Money? The only backstory that would have made sense for these three would have been a shot of them getting dropped as infants because they're about as smart as the three stooges, if not less. It's especially baffling since it seemed that they were meant to be complex and interesting characters. There's also an unnecessarily ridiculous subplot that involves a love triangle even though you don't even realize Rocky and Money are dating until it's too late to even matter.<br/><br/>Other minor but unignorable faults with the movie include the fact that no neighbors, no cars and no pedestrians seem to surround the area who could hear regularly recurring screams or loud gunshots. The thieves keep screaming out each other's names in front of the guy they're robbing. The blind guy despite having heightened senses (even olfactory) can't feel people nearly bump into him or feel their scared tingly twitchy sweaty presence. And out of all my eye rolls, the ending made me roll my eyes the hardest. <br/><br/>On the plus side, the film is visually interesting. It doesn't feel too cramped or visually boring despite majority of it taking place in the same house. The actors actually do a really great job, especially Jane Levy who gave a really convincing performance. Stephen Lang is creepy and intimidating (and strangely attractive) as a psychotic blind man (he's actually officially just The Blind Man) The premise is interesting and original and they did manage to wring out some decent substance.<br/><br/>Sadly the bad outweighs the good and we're left with a film in which the main characters self-sabotage their own survival by making the worst decisions possible. Maybe they have issues because their parents named them things like Rocky and Money. My advice: Don't watch the trailer. Don't expect smart characters. Don't hold your breath."
"Screen_Blitz","9","5","12","4 September 2016"," Don't watch alone
","Director Fede Alvarez demonstrated some potent skills in 2013 remake of Sam Raimi's classic 'Evil Dead', showing an solid balance of over-the-top gore and spine-chilling scares. Though the dark humor factor from Sam Raimi's entry was mostly absent, it not only made for an astoundingly terrifying experience from beginning to end, but fostered strong nightmarish visuals that made Sam Raimi's installment a true scare fest. This gripping thriller sees Fede Alvarez continuing his journey of brood, white-knuckle thrills with a brilliantly crafted plot and nightmarish atmosphere that is bound to leave even the bravest of the bunch leaning at the edge of their seats. While the movie isn't terribly original or groundbreaking in any sense, it knows how to deliver the scares effectively and smartly. This film follows three teenagers: Alex (played by Dylan Minnette), Rocky (played by Jane Levy), and her boyfriend Money (played by Daniel Zavotto), growing up in the poor streets of Detroit, who make money off of committing robbery hoping to make enough money to leave town and move to California. When they across an old rundown house, they not only discover it's holding of a $300,000 cash donation he received following the death of his daughter but learn the house is owned by an old blind Vietnam War veteran (played by Stephen Lang). Using his blindness as a perfect opportunity, the trio breaks in to and take a run for the money. Unfortunately, they learn the man is not as helpless as he appears and soon pitted in a violent fight for survival.<br/><br/>If you are someone who is easily scared in horror flicks, then you are in for a perfect treat because this one 88-minute piece almost never lets you rest easy; especially when sitting under the loud surround sound at the theaters. From the opening minutes of the robbery to the end, this film pits you in a dark, eerie atmosphere where suspense is around every corner and not limited to an ominous music score to tune up the suspense. And the scariest part is it takes almost entirely in one house, and mostly during the nighttime. The suspense is generated not through the effective lighting, but also with a powerful music score by Roque Banos. The music score is effective at capturing the sheer intensity of the scenes during the the characters' encounters with the old man. But the films is quite fair at not overlying on the ominous music to keep the suspense in tune, and thanks to Fede Alavarez's strong execution some of the scares work even without support of the heavy music. A good example lies in a scene the living room when the characters try to escape from the old man (who's blind) but must overcome the creepiness of the floorboards that disturb hearing. The man's ability of head comes to a great advantage above his lack of sight in many scenes. There's over a handful of jump scares that come when you least expect it, some of which involve a vicious dog; and plenty of scenes destined to make viewers with claustrophobia uncomfortable. From the frightening visuals and low lighting, these scenes are deeply unnerving, but definitely not without the solid performances by Dylan Minnette, Jane Levy, and Daniel Zovatto. These three are undeniably convincing in their roles and make for some interesting characters. While these characters are a bit gray in the moral compass that makes some a little hard to root for, they are always interesting and never too short of humanity. Stephen Lang is also solidly convincing, if a bit off-putting in the antagonist role. Though it doesn't have a whole lot other than a dozen lines, his portrayal of the disturbed tyrant figure is not easy to ignore.<br/><br/>Don't Breath is easily the best and most scary film of the year so far, and it definitely shows director Fede Alvarez at the top of his game. This film is a must-watch for all horror fans, though it's not likely to go down as a classic; but safe to say it is close enough. If you see this movie, I strongly advise you bring a friend because watching this alone will probably not be an easy ride, but that is what makes this such an effective horror film."
"terrellrobinson71","9","5","12","1 September 2016"," A old-fashioned and eerie thriller that is bound to leave you breathless
","Now this is what I'm talking about. ""Don't Breathe"" is a simple, but very energetic home-invasion horror thriller that has chills and thrills. Plus, no cheap jump scares found here, just pure horror done the good old-fashioned way. And it also provides a few twists that are so shocking, they will leave you speechless. This is Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez's follow-up to the ultra-gory, but stylish and thrilling ""Evil Dead"" remake. Here, he takes a more relaxed approach with less gore and more storytelling. Set in Detroit, the movie follows Rocky (Jane Levy), a young girl who is trying to get herself and her little sister out of here, along with her boyfriend Money (It Follows' Daniel Zovatto). Rocky's friend is Alex (Dylan Minnette from last year's ""Goosebumps""), whose dad works at one of those security companies. Their plan to end all plans, of course, is to rob the house of a blind man who has a huge sum somewhere and they will be on their way. It turns out that this blind man known as ""The Blind Man"" (Stephen Lang) is a war veteran and is a lot more skilled than they think he is. He knows every corner, frame and room of this house and he is certainly not afraid to strike. But he also has a few things lurking in that house. Now, this is where I stop, because the rest I want you to see for yourself. The way how this movie was designed is through the old-fashioned techniques that most filmmakers haven't used in a while. Alvarez uses tracking shots, sound and a great deal of foreboding to keep us on our toes and to make our hairs stand on end. Credit must given to cinematographer Pedro Luque, production designer Naaman Marshall and three editors for knowing how to pull us in through style, substance and restraint. It also features one of the best scores I've heard since ""Gone Girl"" and that is the unsettling and eerie score courtesy of Roque Banos, who seem to have taken a few pages from the Reznor/Ross guidebook. I think one of the most memorable characters ever created in my opinion is ""The Blind Man"". Stephen Lang, who has played villains before, makes this character subtly effective and very terrifying. He doesn't say a lot (nor does he should), but with those piercing eyes, a magnetic presence and the way he walks with no mercy and no fear, Lang carries this challenging task on his shoulders and runs with it. There's no need to question his loyalties, because you can't tell if these characters are good or bad. Jane Levy, who worked with Alvarez on ""Evil Dead"" and gave such a fearless performance in that film is even more convincing this time. She and Dylan Minnette are great at conveying fears with their eyes and trying not to make any sounds while walking in the dark. I'm certainly not going to forget this movie. I haven't reacted to a film this stunning since David Fincher's ""Panic Room"". Both films do give a very claustrophobic feel of what's it like to be trapped in a house. But ""Don't Breathe"" gets the upper hand because someone knows how to take that fear and cranks it up to 11. You never know what you're going to expect and you don't know how it is going to turn out, but it takes a big dive and it's not afraid to go all out. Here's a very subtle response from me: It's bound to leave you breathless."
"romneyranjo","9","5","12","1 September 2016"," Probably one of the best horror films this year - a horror film you'll truly ENJOY
","Honestly this film's so good.<br/><br/>I actually thought it was going to be gruesome cause the team that brought this film was almost the same team that made EVIL DEAD 2016, but it was nowhere near that. It managed to be entertaining and a horror-classic without tapping into gore too much. It actually helped the film that they left a few things to the imagination. It makes the pain even more painful for the AUDIENCE, as their senses were put to work. You feel the pain because you don't see the pain. Your brain plays with your body, and it's so damn effective.<br/><br/>3 THINGS I think were a bit NAH to me:<br/><br/>1. Continuity - there was ONE SPECIFIC SCENE I'm pretty sure wasn't consistent. It was at the beginning part: JANE LEVY who played ROCKY was smoking at the car then offer it to her boyfriend (who later calls her, her bitch --- SPOILER --- so imagine the audience's pleasure when he died, altho it was already seen at the trailer. So ROCKY gave her stick to her boyfriend, and then at the next shot, we see her smoking a stick while looking outside.... How did she get that? If the scene wasn't connected then it would've escaped my eyes and it would've made sense but it wasn't a montage or a time lapse, it happened in between a conversation.<br/><br/>2. THE CHARACTERS - Honestly this factor's a bit confusing since it CAN be a good thing, but MAY also disturb others. THE CHARACTERS are so confusing to root for, except for ALEX (Dylan Minnette). Alex is the character you'd definitely root for, but sort of know that he's gonna ---- SPOILER ---- NOT GONNA MAKE IT. BUT it was still a pleasure to see him fight, run, and try to survive the night. The other characters, however, had too messed up choices that you're pretty sure you'd want to see them go away. ROCKY's character was sooooooo confusing. You want her to survive but you don't. You wanna side with the BLIND MAN but you kind a don't. It's so irritating but kind a interesting at the same time.<br/><br/>3. THE ENDING - The ending was a bit off for me. I wanted it to end somewhere else, but maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>---- BEST THING: They managed to make such a simple plot really interesting by giving their 'killer' reasons to rage even more, thus, creating a more dangerous avenue for your 'rats'. They also give you reasons to root for both sides cause both are HUMANS (Aren't perfect: they have bad stuff at their backs, but also have good intentions/reasons for doing those bad things)<br/><br/>--- BASICALLY, the formula of this film is that it's going to intensify an already intense scene or it's going to up it's game by making your 'wishes' for the film to get confused. You'll ask yourself by the end of the film: ""Did ROCKY really deserve to survive? WTF did ALEX deserve to have been considered a burglar? Did the BLIND MAN really deserve to live? YOU JUST DON'T KNOW what to feel but yah, this film is just so smart."

","Don't Breathe has one of the most interesting ideas for a movie I've seen in a long time, and it doesn't fail to provide a good movie to go along with it. The characters, story, and twists could have used some work in my opinion, especially nearing the half-way mark, but it didn't take away too much from the rest of the movie since scene structure and pacing were done so well. Despite being classified under the horror genre, I found it to be less scary and more suspenseful than anything else. If does a great job of setting the atmosphere, and making the audience feel connected to the characters. All in all, Don't Breathe is a very well made horror/thriller that I don't think people are going to forget about any time soon."

The script is brilliant and provided a perfect ingredient for a fast paced thriller. Acting was decent. Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette was great to watch. The frustration, anger, fear and desperation was portrayed well by these actors. Stephen Lang did a fantastic job as a blind army veteran which went well with his muscular body and heavy voice. Direction was awesome. Fede Alvarez did an awesome job. The idea of showing certain things which would play a key role later in the movie as the burglars enter the house was great. Some scenes were very well shot inspite of being in dark. U can feel that it's dark but as audience u know what's going on. The cinematography was very good by Pedro Luque. The background score by Roque Banos is one of the highlight. The editing was top notch. Eric L. Beason, Louise Ford n Gardner Gould did a fantastic job. It grossed over $90 million against a $9.9 million budget. Wow. Speaks volume. Movies which audience may find similar- Panic room, Wait until dark, The Collector, Livid.

","Director/Writer Fede Alvarez, along Producer/Writer Rodo Sayagues, know a thing or two about scary and suspenseful films (Evil Dead, Panic Attack). Here, three young low level hoodlums decide to rob a blind man (well played by Stephen Lang - the ""Avatar"" series) who lives in an abandoned neighborhood in Detroit. Rocky (the edgy Jane Levy - TV's ""Suburgatory"") is the female attraction to the gritty Money - that's his character name - Daniel Zovatto (TV's ""Fear the Walking Dead) and wholesome Alex (cutie-pie Dylan Minnette - TV's Scandal). With a plausible storyline and terrific acting by all involved, things and situations go south quickly, leaving the audience little time to breathe. To Alvarez's credit, he doesn't include any of that typical unnecessarily busy camera work associated with many of today's horror films, so the audience finds themselves easily walking the walking (at times in the dark) along side the characters. There is a not so plausible subplot that comes to light towards the end of the film, but luckily it manages to not weight down the overall experience. ""Don't Breathe"" is small film filled with big suspenseful, proving there are still good scary films to be made."
"asda-man","9","4","9","5 September 2016"," You won't be able to
","Being a horror fanatic, I'd been in the know about Don't Breathe for months before the trailer had even come out. It had premiered at some weird festival and started generating a lot of hype. ""The best horror movie in decades!"" You know that sort of thing which people seem to say about every good horror movie coming out. So I'd been excited about it and I was also a fan of Fede Alvarez's fun Evil Dead remake. I avoided any trailers and tried to put aside the general hype after being disappointed with Green Room earlier in the year and just went in with the mindset that this was going to be an above average horror film. I needn't have worried because Don't Breathe totally lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe is exactly the kind of horror film I love. Intense, thrilling and relentless. It's set mainly in one location and follows three young tea leafs robbing an elderly blind man. Fede does a great job of crucially making us care for these criminals, or at least one of them. Jane Levy is the girl you'll be rooting for here and we're given a lovely bit of context which outlines her desperate situation so that our sympathies lie with her. It takes just enough time to build the characters and the plot so that we care about the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Once the kids step into the little old house the film really begins and I was left holding my breath until the very end. At first I was a little concerned as I couldn't see how the filmmakers could spread robbing a blind OAP into a 90 minute film. I mean, he's blind, how hard can it blummin' be? It turns out very. This isn't just any old blind man, this is an ex soldier with ears like a bat who's still equipped with the skills to beat any grown man to a pulp. He's a character who you'll go away remembering thanks to Stephen Lang's dominant presence as well as the character's dark backstory which is best left unrevealed.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe spends most of its running time squeezing every last bit of suspense it can. It reminded me a bit of the French horror, Inside, although of course far less extreme. Just in the sense that it's an absolute roller coaster despite being confined to one location and a few characters. It's a really intense film and at times I was left covering my mouth just in case I made a noise which the blind man could hear. All of the tension comes from Fede Alvarez's superb directing skills though. We're given long and still takes instead of quick shaky edits so you can see what's happening on screen. The use of silence is particularly key in creating tension though and the effect is used to its absolute best here.<br/><br/>Whilst the film isn't the most original, it still feels fresh and unpredictable thanks to the superb high level of quality across all departments. The directing is masterful, the writing is taut, the music is effective, the acting is good for the most part, although the young Tom Cruise lookalike was a little wooden at times. The film also offers some deliciously dark ideas which I've never seen explored before in a horror film. So whilst we've seen this kind of scenario before (Livid has exactly the same premise) Don't Breathe still proves itself to be one of the very best of its kind.<br/><br/>To say any more about Don't Breathe would be to spoil the nail-biting twists and turns in store. All you need to know is that it's a relentlessly intense experience which never gives you a chance to breathe. It looks like Fede will have a long and promising career in horror, as with only two films under his belt, he has proved that he has the skills to create some of the best horror films that Hollywood has to offer. And let's just take a moment to appreciate all the fantastic horror films 2016 has had to offer. In any other year, Don't Breathe would've been my number one but with films like: The Conjuring 2, 10 Cloverfield Lane, The Witch (my personal favourite of the year so far) and the upcoming Blair Witch, we've been treated to a surge of seriously high quality horror. Don't Breathe can still sit proudly among them though. It's a taut, adrenaline-fuelled ride which I can't imagine anyone not enjoying."

Rarely do I see horror films or comedies rated anywhere around a 7 on IMDb, so when I saw a 7.8 three days in a row for this film, I had to see it. And I wasn't disappointed. <br/><br/>I gave this film a nine and not an eight or seven because I feel it deserves a higher rating than 7.8. It had foreshadowing, amazing acting, editing was incredible in every way, symbolism, great writing, directing; I could go on. <br/><br/>If you like Sinister, The Sixth Sense, The Shinning, 28 Days Later, High Tension, Halloween (1978), or It Follows, I can almost guarantee, you'll like this film. Any of those films have in common with this film the gift of constantly making you stressed for the preyed upon characters. <br/><br/>I've noticed that James Wan started a trend with the long fluent single shots like in his film Death Sentence, where there is a scene in a parking lot that runs multiple stories and goes on for about a straight five minutes. In this films they had a shot when the teens enter the house that would prove to be incredibly difficult to shoot and probably take quite a while to figure out the timing of the camera and actor's movements. That said, the shot was so perfect that most movie-goers probably wouldn't even notice. I however look for that specifically or else I wouldn't have noticed.<br/><br/>The acting in the film was above average. I've seen two of the four actors out of the main cast, but the other two I hadn't and I can't believe I haven't. There are moments in the film that you're probably rooting for the actors and not even realizing that it's fake. It feels so incredibly real because of all the film elements that are just perfect. <br/><br/>The film as a whole, is an experience and one that other films should start comparing themselves to. This film should set the bar for all future horror films. If they have half the potential this does, then they will be just fine. See this film."

The biggest one is the script with dialogues serving their purpose and a flawless structure, the problem resides in the lack of character development particularly for the young protagonists, we find ourselves struggling to root for these individuals, we don't really get a chance to know and care for them, we are mere witnesses to some youths trying to get out of a horrible situation.<br/><br/>Besides the blindness of the antagonist, Don't Breathe is a barely disguised remake or, let's call it, a carbon copy of ""The People under the stairs"": social commentary on American economic despair, maze- like suburban house, street-wise burglars, dark secret in the basement, air vent chases,... Blimey, all the way down to the rottweiler... Do I need to say more?<br/><br/>Don't let the above issues spoil it, Don't Breathe is a very enjoyable thrilling ride perfectly executed and absolutely watchable but, please, don't call it original."

"sebastian-breaux","9","5","13","27 August 2016"," A unique, tense ,terrifying, and amazing film that marks the return of the horror genre
","A unique movie that actually had me feel tension and fear for once in a horror movie. Beautiful cinematography and a unique concept. My worry for the film was that the blind man would be almost superhuman in his other senses, but the movie portrays him very realistically and conveys a tense and fearful roller-coaster of a ride. It also does not rely on music as much as other horror films do to set up the emotion of a scene. It also was scary in a natural way and did not have to force the fear into you. It did not rely on cheap jump scares and gore fests. The only downside to the film were some common clichés. The girl with a troubled household has the worlds worst mother and the moms boyfriend is covered in Nazi tattoos so he is horrible too. Also they have the good hearted 3rd wheel who likes the girl,but she has a boyfriend and he is a complete a***hole. Those assure the movie was amazing. The acting was amazing on Jane Levy's part and is setting her self up to be the go to protagonist in horror films. The creators of the Evil Dead remake were behind this movie and I loved that movie as well. I can't wait to see what they will do next"
"burlesonjesse5","8","5","13","26 August 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Don't Breathe
","In Don't Breathe, one of the main characters is a blind Army veteran. At the beginning of the film, he is seen walking with a standard, blind man's cane. Cut to the last act and it's as if the filmmakers forgot that the dude even lost his own vision. Also in ""Breathe"", every actor/actress gets severely tortured, beaten, or thrown up against a wall. They get up, dust themselves off, and forge on. Now could any human being survive this kind of carnage? Not a chance in my book. Anyway, these two factors are the only points I shaved off my rating for one of the best releases of 2016. <br/><br/>Don't Breathe in essence, seems like a great title for the film I'm about to review. If you choose to check out a screening, you'll be so enthralled you'll forget to um, ""breathe"" and possibly chew off every fingernail on both hands.<br/><br/>""Breathe's"" director is Fede Alvarez. He made the forgettable remake Evil Dead. Here, he goes from amateur status to almost genius status in a little over three years. Fede comes back with a vengeance giving us one of the most effective thrillers I've seen in a long time. He fits every plot point neatly in place, supplies efficacious close-pus, provides camera-work that feels Brian De Palma-lite, and throws lots of genuine twists and turns at you. And just when you think Don't Breathe is about to end, it just keeps going, relentless and interminable. Does that add to the flick's potency? Uh, you know it.<br/><br/>Notice that I labeled ""Breathe"" a thriller. That's what I believe it to be. Most critics and IMDb enthusiasts have saddled it as a horror fest. I go more with the latter route and it's a nasty and unforgiving one at that. At 88 minutes, ""Breathe"" is bloodily violent and stomach-turning but not in a demon sort of way. Instead, it absorbs you as if you've been in the theater for 2-plus hours. It's a little movie made on a tiny budget (under $10 million) but it nestles in your brain and has a big chip on its shoulder. If you're a fan of suspense and like simple agog, genre pleasures, Don't Breathe is the ticket. ""Don't"" hesitate to get your butt to the multiplex to see it. Natch.<br/><br/>Taking place in Detroit, Michigan (which is made to look like modern day Beirut), containing only a smidgen of actors, and produced by the legendary Sam Raimi, Don't Breathe is lean and mean with remnants of films like The Descent and Cujo to keep you floored. It has no real protagonist or hero. Everyone involved is a bad person in their own little way. The story is about three lawless thieves named Rocky (Reese Witherspoon lookalike Jane Levy), Money (Daniel Zovatto), and Alex (Dylan Minnette). They break into people's houses and are very successful at it until they meet their match trying to rob a guy simply known as ""The Blind Man"" (played nicely by Avatar's Stephen Lang). ""The Blind Man"" knows how to fire a gun, knows how to arm himself with fists, and obviously has darn good hearing. He senses these cocky kids are trying to steal a money settlement from him in his old, rundown house (the amount of the settlement is I guess, $300k). Bad move. ""The Blind Man"" kills one of the thieves (spoiler) and traps the other two in his abode until he is able to finish them off as well. ""The Blind Man"" with his snarly dog to aid him, also bolts everything up and turns his whole place into a fun house you'd find at an amusement park. Watch for a scene a la Silence of the Lambs in which he turns all the lights off so that his captors can experience what he experiences everyday. Also, check out the opening shot where a body is being dragged on a deserted street. You don't know what you're seeing until the camera eventually zooms in. Pretty unexpected.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Despite its minimal shortcomings, Don't Breathe is grubby, dirty, and darkened with above average performances. It is by turns original, indigenous, and tension-filled. A new classic. Rating: 3 and a half stars."
"jdesando","Null","5","13","25 August 2016"," Downright scary and inventive.
","Almost 50 years ago I was thrilled by Wait Until Dark, a horror film in which a usually demure Audrey Hepburn, playing a recently divorced blind woman, turns the tables on three thugs who invade her home. Today in Don't Breathe the tables are turned a different way: a blind man (Stephen Lang) gives as good as he gets while three young thieves try to rob his home. As for home invasion, Straw Dogs, with no blind motif, left me hoping for more of it all.<br/><br/>Set in decaying Detroit, the thieves, Rocky (Jane Levy); Alex (Dylan Minnette); and Money (Daniel Zovatto) are themselves rotten robbers, hitting homes for which Rocky's dad's security business unwittingly supplies the keys. In this blighted neighborhood the blind man is the last holdout, although he's well equipped for trouble with his Vietnam experience, a vicious Rottweiler, and $300,000 to protect.<br/><br/>Although nothing scary is outside the purview of the standard horror film, director Fede Alvarez and DP Pedreo Luque take the steadicam to new heights of ingenuity by tracking through the claustrophobic corridors and air ducts along with wounded thieves and the rabid dog. The bird's eye shots outside the house, rather than giving hope for relief, serve well to isolate the proceedings with nary a hope for relief for anyone in the house. The jump scares are standard horror, but somehow they feel new or at least unexpected.<br/><br/>Most everyone in Don't Breathe gets a comeuppance, some more deserving than others. A sense of justice pervades the proceedings just like the appropriateness of the decay motif. However I want to spin the themes, even ones that comment obliquely about the war in Vietnam and urban blight, what is most important for the horror genre are scares.<br/><br/>You may not breathe during the many scary set pieces, and as you consider their allegorical implications, you'll be glad you had the bejesus scared out of you because that's why you're there."
"gorepump","8","4","10","20 December 2016"," Suspenseful and surprisingly brutal horror film...
","There definitely seems to be a resurgence of higher quality American horror films hitting the theaters lately. ""Don't Breathe"" is a fantastic flick that's rife with suspense and throws in a pretty f- cked up 'twist'...<br/><br/>Three petty Detroit thieves break into upscale homes and take just enough sh*t to avoid what would amount to a felony. Not scoring nearly enough cash to make it out of the God-forsaken, derelict city, they get word of a blind war vet who is sitting on a 300-grand settlement so they figure it'd be a cinch to break into his house and lift it. Turns out, what this guy lacks in sight he makes up for, ten fold, in stomping mud-holes in the asses of intruders. Once trapped inside his domicile, the petrified criminals are forced to take the film's title to heart and not let the gun-toting blind badass hear them breathe as they look for a way out.<br/><br/>I honestly can't find a whole lot wrong with ""Don't Breathe"". This is one suspenseful, well-structured and excellently paced horror movie. One of the best I've seen in a long time. The blind man character is terrifically merciless toward his trespassers and - during an unexpected turn of events - it becomes much more open-to- question as to whether or not he is totally the 'victim' or not. Definitely did NOT see that sh*t coming! I'll never touch a turkey baster again... Gotta hand it to Fede Alvarez as ""Don't Breathe"" knocks his previous ""Evil Dead"" remake out of the water. Hopefully he sticks with his own concepts from now on and keeps turning out sh*t of this caliber, cuz I'm certainly impressed. Along with ""The Witch"", I had two surprisingly enjoyable trips to the theater this year.<br/><br/>More horror/exploit reviews at http://swinesewage.blogspot.com/"

","Love the idea, the premise, and all the positive reviews so was really looking forward to this, <br/><br/>maybe was over-hyped, but at times i thought it was just dreadful, NONE of this movie makes sense, he's blind, this they know, so they rob him at night while he's at home in the dark by smashing a window in his house??<br/><br/>maybe i missed something but i'm sure there was one scene where they went into a room, it was a dead end and there was no escape as the only window had metal bars, then when the dog broke in the guy randomly fell out of a different window and dropped down a couple of feet... maybe i need to watch again, but was weird, where did the window come from!!!! and why did the dog coming into the room propel the guy out of it!<br/><br/>for me this was as if someone had a really good idea for a movie and then the peeps that funded it threw in a hundred clichés and rubbish that completely ruined it. you can see the idea but it's ruined in my opinion. awful back stories, scenes that make no sense, and the opening 5 seconds gives too much away. disappointing."
"paulmcuomo","9","4","10","11 September 2016"," Almost perfect. Undoubtedly tense as hell!
","Picture the scene: the production house logos have just passed, and we cut to an aerial shot of Detroit of our villain - Norman, 'The Blind Man' as played by Stephen Lang - dragging a bloody girl down the street, constantly zooming down, soundtrack buzzing, scary as hell. And it doesn't really let up until the end.<br/><br/>The movie's 4 main cast are great, the only annoying one being Money who is the guy who plans everything and is a total dick about it, but he gets killed fairly soon so I can easily forget about it, and it was well acted so yes. The Blind Man, who it turns out is absolutely nowhere near as helpless as he first appeared, is easily one of the best villains of the year. He's got the right look, of an old man but stupidly well built for it, grizzled and intimidating as hell, great performance here. The two, Suburgatory's Jane Levy, who is very different person here and not least because of her blonde hair, makes for a character who is morally dubious but I still want to support, and the same can be said for Alex Minnette's character also called Alex.<br/><br/>This movie's biggest strength is that is, at first, knows it's limits. The weak villain makes him real, and so when Rocky (Levy) and Alex are running from him, it gives them even grounding to an extent and the scares have more effect, and in the part in the trailer where the lights are turned off in the basement and he chases them with a gun in the dark, it's impossibly tense. Literally, in a large amount of this film I was holding my breath. There was also a surprising lack of jump scares, or when they were, it was the arrival of something dangerous i.e the Blind Man or his vicious dog. The sound design of the film was really great; how the sound was heightened really gave a feeling of how 'loud' they are.<br/><br/>The thing that keeps the movie from being a 10 from me, is that in the final 7-15 minutes, it feels like a part that should've stayed in the first draft of the script. Don't get me wrong, it does result in two great action set pieces, but it goes past a point where it does raise a good moral quandary of ""who's the real bad guy here?"" and becomes a bit over blown and this is enforced by a bizarre bit of sequel baiting that felt odd. If you like it, fine, and it certainly didn't kill this competent and tense as hell thriller masterclass. So yes, certainly one of the best horror thrillers this year, go see Don't Breathe!"
"jadepietro","8","4","10","6 September 2016"," Three Blind Mice
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 )  THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A nifty little thriller that relies on suspense rather than  gore.  GRADE: B  SYNOPSIS: Three thugs decide to rob a home with unexpected results.   JIM'S REVIEW: Let me begin my review by sharing one of my favorite  movie-going experiences. As a child, we were visiting all the tourist  sights of New York City. That afternoon, we were hustled to our seats  at the cavernous Art Deco beauty known as Radio City Music Hall to see  the Rockettes and their musical extravaganza, to be followed by a movie  called Wait Until Dark. The thriller, about a group of robbers  terrorizing a blind Audrey Hepburn was riveting to me. And during a  climactic battle of wits between the defenseless victim and her  stalker, the entire community of moviegoers gave out a loud primal  scream, levitated from their seats, and then laughed at their own  reactions. Like a well choreographed flash mob scene before its time,  but totally unplanned. Wonderful, I thought, this is what movies can  do!  Which brings me to the film, Don't Breathe, which follows almost the  exact same formula and plot. Not to the same desired effect, but still  impressive by today's standards. The cat vs. mouse set-up is part of a  time-worn tradition in a game-turning series of events. Strategically  staged and with a hell-bent slyness, the film has more bumps in the  night than most usual horror thrillers. This is due to the skills of  its director, Fede Alvarez. With this being only his second film that  he directed (the first being an awful remake of Evil Dead), Mr. Alvarez  is a talent to watch. Vastly superior to his first venture where he  seemed more obsessed with the grisly blood factor, this film is not as  graphically violent as that first film (which detracted from the  suspense). With this film, he is more restrained and in control as a  director. The shock factor is still there, but handled with more  finesse (except for a short detour into sexual abuse that is crass and  disturbing).  The premise is simple, more an outline than a story: Three thugs decide  to rob a home with unexpected results. The trio includes Alex (Dylan  Minette), a sensitive love-sick delinquent, Rocky (a fine Jane Levy), a  desperate and savvy partner wanting to escape from her abusive and  poverty-ridden lifestyle, and Money (Daniel Zovatto), a psychopath.  Their victim is supposed to be the owner of the house, a blind  ex-soldier who is nameless in the film. Effectively played by Stephen  Lang, the stage is ready for twists and turns...perhaps too many, as it  wears out its welcome with an overindulgence of multiple endings and  strained confrontations that become contrived and threaten to impact on  the film's credibility as the predators instantly become prey.  Still Don't Breathe generates maximum tension with a minimum of  modern-day gore, just enough which should suffice its Generation Z  audience. The script, by the director and his writing partner, Rodo  Sayagues, is formulaic and predictable, but it successfully maintains  suspense and provides the thrills. Going in to this genre of movies you  get what you expect, but there is some wit and cleverness in the film's  visuals, particularly in a ""lights-out segment"" that is downright  creepy and excitingly filmed by Pedro Luque .  With the spooky sleeper hit, Don't Breathe, the tension builds in a  logical and slightly claustrophobic way, as Mr. Alvarez and his cast  notches up the suspense ratio in a nifty little thriller that delivers  more goosebumps headed in your direction. So sit back and try to relax."

","All and all this wasn't the best thriller I have watched, but it wasn't the worst either. I think this film had potential to be one of the best, but sadly the ending felt rushed, and cliché. <br/><br/>Of course there are going to be plot twists and that is to be expected, this one used up their shocker midfilm, and were unable to close with anything better. <br/><br/>I found myself disliking Jane Levy's acting. I am not sure if her charter was scripted to be that way or if she couldn't act. I found no emotion from her, couldn't relate to her character at all. I just cant/couldn't imagine someone would ever react to these situation as she did. From the mothers ""BJ"" hint, to seeing what happens to her friend or boyfriend."

"cultfilmfan","7","4","10","27 August 2016"," Don't Breathe
","Don't Breathe, is a film that I thought within the first little while of watching it was setting itself up for what could be a really interesting horror film, but also one that had something interesting to say as well. Take for example that the film is set in the present time and takes place in Detroit, Michigan. The film shows dilapidated and run down houses and shows an economy that is far from booming and that basically the people who live there are living in shabby conditions and don't have a lot of money, or the best resources to support themselves. This is interesting by itself for the simple and honest fact that just a handful of years ago, Detroit did end up going bankrupt and the city was in dire need of an economic and financial rescue. The film could have really gone somewhere with this and made an interesting social commentary about it such as the fact that the main characters in the film basically support themselves by breaking and entering into houses and selling the goods they receive on the black market. They do this because this is the only way of life and the only way to make cash that they know of and it is their dream to eventually move out of this impoverished community and eventually head to California, where despite droughts and potential earthquakes, the economy is always booming and there are jobs in abundance, or so it seems in the film industry and movies themselves. This could have been an interesting social comment, or just a thoughtful look at how many people in the world are suffering now with little to no money and having to resort to desperate acts in order to take care of themselves. Something else that could have given food for thought, or added some much needed depth to the film was the character of the blind man. While, I am not going to say too much as to not give away any spoilers, I will say that he is a man tormented by inner demons which have all seemed to have befallen him through no fault of his own and now has made him the bitter and twisted person that he is. Things such as loss of loved ones plus the horrors and traumas of war also come into play here. As said earlier, these could have all made for the ingredients of an interesting film and one that has something to say, but unfortunately the film never really does anything with these interesting plot build ups, but instead just lets the film fall into familiar territory and become like so many horror films that we see on the mainstream market nowadays. The sad thing here is that the film is technically well made with excellent direction, cinematography, editing and the acting is better than most horror films these days allow for. I will even credit the film and say that there is certainly a fair bit of tension at least for the first little while of the film and it does have a couple of moments where it leaves the audience in actual fear, or suspense which is a job that is not easily done for horror filmmakers recently. These are all strong points of the film and for the first while the film really captured my interest from the second it started, but the unfortunate thing here again is that the film is basically a game of cat and mouse and even though the film is relatively short in it's running time, the sad thing is it becomes tiresome and I began to lose interest way before the end credits started to roll. Things in the film just kept getting more and more preposterous and hard to believe and it seems like they were just using all the old tricks in the book to keep this film going and trying to be interesting, but by that point I had long stopped caring and I was more, or less just waiting for the film to end, so I could go home again. This is a film that certainly showed potential with items and agendas that could have been really eye opening, but would also make not only a thrilling, but engaging film and yet the filmmakers seemed to have run out of steam early on and not really knew how to conclude this film, or elevate it to any higher levels of quality. While it stands it is far from the worst film of the year and it does have enough merits to it, but there have been better horror films lately and sadly this is far from one of them which makes this film more of a rental, or a television watch than to actually go and sink money into the theatre to see it."
"mk1974","6","4","10","27 August 2016"," Well-made but lacking emotional investment
","On a technical level, the movie is well-done. The directing is superb, and most of the acting is good. I love how the movie shows the urban decay of Detroit, making it look like a mix of suburban dream and war zone reality. At its heart, the movie is in many ways about broken dreams.<br/><br/>However, there is one huge flaw in the movie that, for me, completely knocked it down several pegs and undermined the entire thing, and that is that I disliked and felt no sympathy for no single character in it.<br/><br/>In order for suspense to work well, the viewer has to be invested in a character. If you don't care about anyone, you're not going to feel suspense when they are in danger. The characters in this are wholly unlikable and unsympathetic, despite rather shallow, cursory attempts at giving them sympathetic motivations.<br/><br/>I'm all for flawed, unlikable characters and anti-heroes. In fact, I prefer such characters. But there has to be something for the viewer to latch onto, something to invest in. Otherwise it's just watching people doing things on a screen.<br/><br/>If the movie weren't so well made on a technical level, I'd have ranked it much lower. I will definitely look for work by the director in the future. But this movie was disappointing, considering the high marks it seems to be getting from critics."
"rgkarim","8","4","10","26 August 2016"," Don't Turn a Blind Eye to This UnScary Thriller
","The end of August is usually full of blunt films that are meant to fill spaces, but sometimes Hollywood knows how to close out the summer in style. The promise of this weekend is the latest horror film called Don't Breathe. Robbie K here, and I'm back to share my opinions and advice on the latest movies. Do we have a champion horror movie? Or are we fooled once again. As alwaysread on to find out. <br/><br/>LIKES:  Suspense  Plot twists  Good pace<br/><br/>When a trailer promises suspense, my experience has been a few on the seat moments often deluded by cheesy plot lines and over exaggerated monsters. Fortunately, Don't Breathe decided to cast its die another way to deliver on what was promised. The movie is filled with suspense from the moment the ""heroes"" enter the house and begin their journey to rob a blind man. Using very simple, though well planned, tactics our main cast of three traverse the dark corridors in hopes of escaping with their lives. Many of the audience cringed with the creak of a rogue floor board, waiting for the military man to appear and hunt his prey. One doesn't realize how silent things are until that sudden sound effect pops out. Yes, the presentation certainly gives you the suspense you are craving, but that's not the only thing they did right. <br/><br/>In terms of plot, horror movies often have quality components, but as a whole are mundane, unoriginal, and formulaic. This movie is very similar to many films, but stands out for the plot twists thrown into the mix. You can get some of these twists from the trailers, however our screenplay writers dropped a few bombs into the mix that take the story down a new road. These surprises keep things fresh and add more urgency to the moment to further bring the thrills you sought with the trailer. And even better its presented at a quick pace that adds more energy to the scenes and a since of adventure that you often miss in horrors. It all feels like a visual version of the most dangerous game and doesn't dawdle to deliver the good stuff. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:  Overly drawn out at times  Not that scary  Uber cheesy<br/><br/>OkayI know that horror movies are always a stretch of the imagination and there are a lot of overly done moments. Don't Breathe, while more on the realistic side, certainly drops into many moments that sometimes feel like it won't end. While some of these moments are focused on narrow misses in the basement, or dodging shots from a gun with seemingly infinite ammunition. My main issue has to be with some of more violent moments, watching the buff military guy beat down the trespassers in vicious fury. Yeah, it delivers some swift justice, but hearing the sounds of squishing blood and grunts of pain gets stupid after a while. I can't say most of it was pointless, but our director may need to get checked out for how much he seemed to enjoy the violent moments. In fact, it seems that the violence was the focus that the scares were left out. Speaking of which.<br/><br/>The scare factor of this movie was not really there for me. Oh sure, a whacked out marine sergeant with a wicked temper and skills is a scary thing to witness due to the realism factor. However, it is not the thing to keep me up at night, minus one of the scenes near the middle of the film. The Blind Man is not the creepy, nightmare inducing monsters/demons/spirits that the genre is famous for. In fact, you kind of feel sorry for him at times which dilutes the scary/creepy factor for most of the film. And the movie fails to use the creepy edge and replaces it with those jump scare moments you can see coming from a mile away. Maybe if they had added a serial killer edge, or a creeped out mental patient moment it would have sweetened the pot.<br/><br/>Finally, the last dislike is the cheesy moments in the film. Before you rip me a new one and say this review is useless hear me out. Yes, horror movies are cheesy it's what allows for the monsters and situations to exist that fans want to dive into. Unfortunately for me that cheesiness took a turn down the wrong avenue for me. First of all, the whole situation wouldn't exist if the main characters weren't overzealous thieves trying to justify their action. The means for the movie made my eyes roll and I actually cheered against the kids in the beginning because of how much I disliked them. In addition, the convenient elements (e.g. guns with lots of shots, vents that are just the right size, and surprisingly resistant bodies) are just some of the other cheesy things they amplify in this movie. I'll give them props for resourcefulness though and managing to dilute the factors to fit into the suspense. <br/><br/>The Verdict:<br/><br/>When it comes to Don't Breathe, the word Thriller is the most appropriate way to describe this film. It provides the continuous suspense that your attention craves and throws enough surprises into the mix to make a decent tale. However, in terms of scary, I can't say it was the most system shocking of the mix. Still I have to recommend this one for the crowd who longs for a fast paced horror who like a bunch of close calls. Yet for the rest of the world, hold out for this one and catch it at Redbox in a few months. <br/><br/>My scores:<br/><br/>Horror/Thriller: 7.0 (Thriller alone a 7.5) Movie Overall: 6.5"

Coming off the mixed reception of his Evil Dead remake, Fede Alvarez is back in the horror genre with Jane Levy and his third directorial, second that is a major motion picture. I found out about this film through a YouTube advertisement and I'm so glad I usually don't skip trailers when there the Ads. I decided to see it for three of the main leads Stephen Lang(who looks like he would make a great Cable in a future X-Men or Deadpool sequel), Dylan Minnette who stared in my favorite horror film of last year(Goosebumps) and of course an actress I would like to see more of and in more horror films Jane Levy. Rocky, Alex and Money are thief's who decide hey let's go rob a blind war veteran so we can have the money to get out of this joint. The War Veteran is a blind man who's angry at the world and holds a dark secret. This film will do what it's set out to do and make you grip your hands tighter and tighter on the seat with the urge of tension filled in your body as the picture unfolds, It has ingenious camera-work in the first scene where the three get inside the house and start looking around. As it spans the house, camera-work I might have seen before I'm sure but when your touring a small environment that your going to be in half the movie it works when the camera spans through going upward to the upstairs, showing us a TV screen and moving towards the right to the bed and under the bed back to the door which is being opened. Most would assume the story isn't interesting since the majority of the film is taken place in one small location especially if it's a horror picture, I bet you have had that thought as well. I however love it when horror pictures are mostly taken place in a small house it's Hitchcock'n in my eye. But as the story unfolds you won't see what's coming. You won't figure out how it ends and you won't figure out what happens next, you'll just have to hold your breath. As you have read I like three of these performers I'll start with Dylan Minette, he doesn't play the same kind of kid he did in Goosebumps I mean come on in the deleted scenes of that film he got bullied I wouldn't by that but here he plays an intelligent kid who can get pass through the security of a home, you can imagine since his father in the film is a cop, he still gets insulted in this film but when he shines out through the rest of this film trying to escape the house he really shows fear due to his situation, Stephen Lang who I must admit I don't know much about was so great when he was on screen he was intimidating, fierce, quick and downright scary. The one actress I really went to see this for Jane Levy I haven't seen her in a film since that Evil Dead remake(and to be quite honest while I do think it's great It's a little too overly disgusting I wish I could watch Ash Vs. Evil Dead that looks way better) and when I saw she was in this and Fede Alvarez was directing I was like this looks way better! She does a great job as Roxy where Jane Levy is once again the final girl(but then again she's the only girl in this situation) and pulls out just a great a performance as she did in Evil Dead with great dialogue. Don't Breath is the horror film I was waiting for Fede Alvarez to make he's a great director who pulled out some great shots in this film with writing and a tight script that you don't see quite often, great performances, and nothing but tension throughout, so what ever you do Don't skip, Don't miss, Don't Breath because it get's a five out of five."

","I don't understand why the major Hollywood studios don't make more low to medium budgeted movies. The financial risk is lower, the return on every invested dollar has a good chance of being higher than on a big budget movie, and the filmmakers of these movies tend to work harder in many aspects to deliver the goods to the audience since they don't have the money for special effects and other eye candy details. ""Don't Breathe"" is an example of such a success. Not just with its financial success at the box office, but that clearly a lot of thought went to figuring out how to entertain its audience on a fairly low budget. The movie is fast-paced, with a story that gets right to business quickly and has no unnecessary fat. The thrills come with old fashioned suspense, which still works in this age of CGI. I have to admit that I was riveted from start to finish, wondering which character (if any) would win out or even survive.<br/><br/>However, I will admit that the movie is not perfect. There are some murky and sometimes hard to swallow plot points, like (spoilers ahead!) how the blind man managed to get his hands on the woman in the basement in the first place, or managed to hide her body completely once the cops came. And while I can believe blind people in real life can work well in and out of home without sight, some of the blind man's elaborate actions in this movie were a bit unbelievable. Fortunately, these and other somewhat questionable script details don't interfere too much, and the movie still ends up being a pretty good thriller."

","While horror and suspense films have always been around it wasn't until the last decade or so that they've become more mainstream. Where they once appeared on the big screen every few months these days they are released almost weekly. That overabundance means that not every movie is worth your time. But when one comes along that is the word needs to be spread. So let me be the first to say DON'T BREATH is worth your time.<br/><br/>Money (Daniel Zovatto), Alex (Dylan Minette) and Rocky (Jane Levy) are a trio of burglars seeking the big score. Alex' father owns a security company and he lifts keys to various houses, the group breaks in stealing items but no cash and then they reset the alarm and set it off to make sure the victims won't suspect an inside job and can cash in on their insurance. The scores are small but that's all about to change.<br/><br/>Each of the group has their own reasons for their burglaries. Money just wants the cash he can get when he trades off the goods to his fence. Alex hopes to pay for law school. And Rocky lives in a trailer with a psychologically abusive mother and her current lay about boyfriend, abusing both Rocky and her younger sister. Rocky dreams of the day she can escape, taking her sister with her.<br/><br/>Money's fence tells him of a big score. A man (Stephen Lang) whose daughter was killed in an auto accident won a lawsuit of $300,000. Rumor has it he has the money stashed in his house, a house protected by the same security company that Alex' father runs. Alex refuses at first but eventually succumbs to the lure of the loot.<br/><br/>When the trio discovers that the man in question is blind it makes them consider the job easier still. They drug his dog outside the house, enter cautiously and find the man asleep in his room. Money lets loose a homemade knockout bomb and the three set out to search for the money. Except that the man wasn't knocked out and he comes looking for them.<br/><br/>Catching Money but not knowing the other two are there since both are silent, he asks if anyone else is in the house. Money says no and the man kills him. Thus the tables are turned and the hunters now become the hunted. They might think they have the advantage but this is a world that the blind man knows by heart. It is his world. Suddenly the odds are stacked in his favor.<br/><br/>All of this would make a fantastic suspense film. But there is another major surprise in store, one that I know I never saw coming. If you reveal that surprise may a pox be on you. It is one that ups the ante of what is going on and shows a greater depth of character in the blind man than first thought. As the saying goes there is more going on beneath it all than we saw.<br/><br/>First and foremost the story is one of the most original and compelling stories I've seen on film in some time. With the exception of Money you sympathize with each of the other main characters. For Alex he wants to do what's right but is lured by his desire for a better life as well as an attraction to Rocky who is in turn Money's girlfriend. Rocky we care about because of the terrible home life we want to see he escape. And for the blind man we feel bad for not only his predicament but the fate that befell his daughter. The odds of all of them having a happy ending are slim at best.<br/><br/>The acting by all is some of the best but will never garner much attention and certainly not find Oscar worthy mention. Horror films and comedies almost never get those accolades no matter how deserving they might be. While each does an amazing job it will be the acting of Levy and Lang that you will find yourself talking about after watching the film. Lang has been around in a number of great roles including those in AVATAR and TOMBSTONE but never seems to get much praise. That's sad because he's one of the great character actors of our time.<br/><br/>Some have called the movie a horror film but I found it more of a suspense movie. Yes, there are some horrific moments in it but the white knuckle moments are what make this film work. Think of WAIT UNTIL DARK (a movie many have forgotten or have never seen) and you'll know what I mean. If you take the time to invest in watching this film make sure you have your snack of choice on hand when it starts because once it gets going you won't want to stop watching."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>To be honest, for the most running time of ""Don't Breathe"" (2016) i was kinda rooting for Stephen Lang's character. And why not? He is a a bit old blind man whose house is being robed by three thieves. Should I've been rooting for thieves? No way. Then the movie showed a bit more lets just say ""awkward"" side of this blind man, which made him kinda villain. <br/><br/>Overall, as there isn't really much to say about this flick i only will say that i was entertained during the whole 1 h 20 min. Its very good paced flick which is entertaining if you can leave your brains for a rest for a while while watching this flick. A pretty good flick."

","Don't Breathe or The Blind Man will hear you! Fede Alvarez comes with a twisted tale of a twisted blind man who lives in a land of the deserted. Those blind eyes tell a story that people always read without knowing about what secrets house in that wretched house of his, until one day three robbers decide to plunder him of his riches. That's when you see past the belied story of the man. That's also when you discover how abominable it is.<br/><br/>The titular thriller justifies the theme of the movie perfectly. I found myself literally holding my breath to ensure the protagonist made it unfazed. What works terribly well for the movie is its plausibility quotient, the way the storyline unfolds by staying true to its roots, and how everything stays connected one by one with steps in the same ladder. All of it makes Don't Breathe seem very tenable.<br/><br/>DIRECTION OF DON'T BREATHE <br/><br/>Fede Alvarez's direction is simply top-notch. The way his camera moves along with him in the house will leave you with goose bumps. To top that all there are weird surprises at every corner and that's what makes it both terrifying and thrilling. To see Stephen Lang pop up out of nowhere breaking those absent rooms with his presence, is outright criminal! You cannot overlook the music of Don't Breathe either; superbly complementing the theme, racing down alongside the thrill! It instantly puts you in the right mood.<br/><br/>PLENTY OF DOPE THRILLS (SPOILERS GASPING AHEAD) <br/><br/>The fact that there are many points of culmination in Don't Breathe will often oscillate you to and fro flinging you towards a surefire neurotic arrest. You will constantly find your heart in your mouth as you try to escape the nefarious blind man yourself thinking at the speed of light just like the unfortunate trapped souls.<br/><br/>That time where the characters grope in dark has been brilliantly shot. Their eyes are dilated as they scrabble to escape their misery in pitch darkness. To have lived something as awful as that is bound to tingle your spines. Also, it hasn't been stretched which makes it even more delectable.<br/><br/>To ice the accursed Blind Man, we have a badass dog that comes at odd junctures, making things even more baleful. It brings that frightening steer in the tale and that fills the movie with even more horror.<br/><br/>It takes in the vanguard a dispensable character Money played by Daniel Zovatto of the It Follows fame, Rocky played by Jane Levy whom we saw in Evil Dead in the 2013 reboot, and Dylan Minnette as Alex of the Goosebumps movie as the thieves who choose the wrong house. Each one of them were superbly cast.<br/><br/>DOWNSIDES <br/><br/>One huge thing about the movie is the weighing in on of its crime. The fact that the intruders were criminals themselves, technically you shouldn't feel sorry for them rather deem everything as poetic justice. But when the real trepidation begins to trickle you realize murder beats them all. You can't help but take sides.<br/><br/>Also, we have seen plenty of thrillers that skim the line of Don't Breathe before. Except for the fact that the killer here is blind; if you take out this apparent crux, the movie stands strangely on the lines of what we have seen plenty of times before. If it weren't for Fede's brilliance, it would have failed to impress.<br/><br/>THE FINAL GAVEL <br/><br/>Don't Breathe is edgy, thrilling and an exhilarating joyride into the crime vale where you are left at the mercy of a psychotic blind man. If you are a thriller aficionado, this movie is just for you.<br/><br/>Go ahead and watch this one!"

","Don't Breathe is the second feature film from co-writer and director Fede Alvarez, who also co-wrote and directed the gory yet enjoyable reboot of Evil Dead (2013). Fans who enjoyed the unique interpretation and style of his previous film will love the similar spin to the genre that Alvarez brings to Don't Breathe.<br/><br/>The suspense is ramped up and maintained from this point forward, really pulling the viewer from scene to scene with a good mix of excellent sound design and more conventional jump scares.<br/><br/>These people are badly written. For instance, we have Money who will rob you, he is rude, and he does this for the rush. Then you have Alex, who should not being doing this. He has a good life and home. He is only doing this because he is so in love with Rocky.<br/><br/>The only somewhat sympathetic one is Rocky. Rocky and Alex may have sympathetic aspects, but ultimately they are criminals. So naturally, we feel for the Blind Man, whom we empathize with because he is a decorated veteran who has suffered his own personal tragedies. That is one of my complaints with the film.<br/><br/>One of the things the movie does well, is they make us hate the main characters, they make us like the main characters, they make us like the blind man, and they make us hate the villain. Therefore, the movie really gives us a roller-coaster of emotions. At times The Blind Man, played by Stephen Lang is creepy yet sympathetic (in a weird way). He really puts you on edge. At times, he can hear a fly fart and come at you as if he is Jason Voorhees! Levy, too is brilliant the way her emotions flit across her face is as crucial to the film's suspense as all the dark corners, closets and jump scares. <br/><br/>From a filmmaking standpoint, this film is spectacular. They have house as the main setting. Which allows the filmmakers to use and experiment lighting in such a masterful way. Alvarez and his cinematographer, Pedro Luque, let the camera move through the Blind Man's home much like a prowler, allowing the viewer to glimpse just enough hints at certain items (like, say, a tool on a wall) that may pay off later. One of the film's strongest sequences is a basement scene where Rocky and Alex grope their way through the dark trying to not to run into the Blind Man, whose acute hearing gives him a distinct advantage.<br/><br/>So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Don't Breathe. Overall, the film contains suspense and thrills throughout. While not a traditional attempt at the genre, the horror film provides enough suspense and drama to keep the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the tight 90-minute run-time. I do think the movie could have been written a little bit better. My biggest complaint is the ending. The movie was working so well, and was original until the ending. It ends like so many other slasher films we have seen. It will probably please fans of this genre with its solid suspense, murky lighting and ""gotcha!"" scares. I believe Don't Breathe earns a<br/><br/>7 out of 10!<br/><br/>This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)"

","Few horror movies can keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. This one does.<br/><br/>Thanks to the well-written story, the never-stopping pace and the very credible acting, the thriller will take you within the house of a blind man, defending himself against three ordinary burglars.<br/><br/>The characters have excellent depth. Stephen Lang (Avatar) does a terrific job as the blind ex-military, his lesser-known fellow actors are very authentic and have stories going of their own.<br/><br/>Clichés are avoided. Expect to be surprised many times. The typical silence before the surprise or action is very misleading, adding up to the tension as well as the creative story development.<br/><br/>If there's one remark to be made, it's the color in the movie. In some parts appropriate, in some parts a bit annoying.<br/><br/>Every few years, there's a really good thriller/horror movie made. Don't Breathe is one of them, even good for non-fans of the genre."

","Rocky, Alex, and Money are a trio of young house robbers. Rock and Money are a couple while Alex has a crush on Rocky. Rocky, her daughter, and Money have dreams of moving from Detroit to...where else...California, it's not like there any other states in the union... Alex is key to their operation. His dad works at a home security company and has files on the homes and for some reason even keys, which Alex then uses to break into the homes. He also knows about the law and the punishments for all crimes. They steal only objects but no cash. They then sell the stuff on the cheap to some guy in a van.<br/><br/>Money comes up with their next score. A blind Army vet who received a multi-million dollar settlement from some rich family whose girl killed the vet's daughter. He lives in a house in a neighborhood full of abandoned houses. When they scout the place, they discover he's got a Rottweiler. Alex doesn't like the idea, because they don't steal cash, but of course eventually agrees.<br/><br/>They drug the dog, find all windows barred, and 4 locks on the main door. Rocky has to squeeze in through some small window. Now they are all in. The plan is to gas the guy to sleep, while they look for the money. They find a heavily-locked door. But then the guy shows up. He fights with Money and kills him. The vet doesn't realize the other two are still there. By luck Rocky discovers the location where he keeps the money. They have no choice but to escape through the basement, through the locked door. In the basement they discover something that changes our view of the vet completely. By now, the vet, who doesn't have a good sense of hearing smells the two and starts going after them, shooting and violently beating them up. The dog by now also also woken up. What follows is almost non-stop action as the movie resolves who, if anyone, gets to survive this.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a little intro by the director thanking the audience for watching it. I thought that was pretty cool. Don't Breathe is one tense horror movie. And to its credit it manages to maintain the tension nearly to the very end. Of course, character development isn't what this movie is about. And this scenario where for most of the movie the characters can't communicate makes for a difficult movie for the audience to connect. But Levy and Minnette make it work. They are likable criminals. And Lang stands out as the blind but buffed and trained vet both vulnerable and threatening. The story could have easily stayed at that but it gives us more with the revelation in the basement. Kudos also to the filmmakers for letting the dog survive which rarely happens in movies. Don't Breathe then has to rely on sounds and cinematography to keep the audience involved and it succeeds remarkably well.<br/><br/>Up to this point, 2016 has been an awful year for horror movies. Don't Breathe is the strongest one so far excelling for its relentless tension."

","In Detroit, Michigan three burglars are looking for the next big score. Rocky(Jane Levy), Alex(Dylan Minnette), and Money(Daniel Zovatto), are mostly small time burglars. They are usually successful, they are quick, and they mostly do a grab and go operation. Most of the homes are protected by a security system, that Alex's father works for. Alex is able to get the spare key to any home. Alex breaks in, and disarms the system before authorities are called.<br/><br/>When Money hears about a new job from his boss he is all in and gets the others to join him. This is a step up from their usual jobs. The house is owned by a retired Iraq war vet. He is the last one on the block, and the area is a ghost town. To the crew this is a gold mine of a job; because the man won a huge wrongful death settlement. His daughter was hit and killed by a driver who was later acquitted of all charges. She got off because she comes from a wealthy family.<br/><br/>When the three show up in the neighborhood, they think it will be easy. Money says to them no people, no 5-0 to deal with. The three survey the house and get the crap scared out of them by the mans dog. When Rocky notices the man(Stephen Lang) is blind, Rocky and especially Alex start to have second thoughts. Money on the other hand is the leader, so the others follow him. At first it looks like it might be an easy job for them. When they get in the house, what looks like a cake walk eventually becomes a fight for survival. When Rocky and Alex discover Money brought a piece with him; they both freak. Alex warns him of the consequences if they get caught, bigger charges and a bigger prison term. The blind man gets awakened when Money enters his room, a very scary situation. Money starts to back up, but it's too late. The man even though he lost his sight in Iraq, has developed his other senses well. He knows every inch of his home, hears every creak; and can sense if someone else is in a room. When things begin to go wrong, Money is the first one to get killed by the man. Due to his overconfidence and big mouth he gets shot by the blind man. <br/><br/>The other two Rocky and Alex hide fearing they are next. When Rocky hides in the closet she texts Alex. Rocky also find the safe where the money is kept, and finds out the combo; when the man comes into the closet. The texts go back and forth; when they both find each other they decide it's time to get the money and split. They try to escape through the basement, only to find a shocking surprise. The woman who hit his daughter is chained up down there. Cindy(Franciska Tordesik) was kidnapped by the blind man. When Rocky and Alex free Cindy they decide to take her with them. The three think they are home free, when they reach the cellar door. When they open it they are confronted by the blind man. He opens fire thinking he got the robbers, but kills Cindy instead. He freaks out, and is very upset when he finds out Cindy was the one he killed. Now it's Alex and Rocky, they have to find a way to fight this psychopath in order to survive. It continues to be a cat and mouse game. When Rocky wakes up to find herself chained up in the basement she freaks. The blind man reason for this, is so Rocky can be a surrogate mother. He wants a child again, thinking this will make him whole. That's why he was distraught when he killed Cindy. She was pregnant with his child. Now Rocky has taken her place, he promises her she will be able to leave after nine months when the baby is born, like he promised Cindy. When he begins to impregnate her artificially, it backfires. Rocky gets free and gets him back, only to find out Alex was killed. She is the only one of the group to survive this hell.<br/><br/>At the end she makes good on her promise to leave Detroit for California. She is at the bus station with her daughter when a news break comes on. There is coverage about the B&E she was involved in. When she notices the coverage the blind man has survived; and the reporters are making him out to be some kind of hero. Saying he fought for his life, killed the intruders, E.T.C .. This movie gives new hope for today's horror films. Stephen Lang is great as The Blind Man. He is really great at being an antagonistic character. I loved him as the evil brother in Fire Down Below, face it the guy can act. Don't Breathe is a creepy movie that is full of jumps and scares. Unlike many horror films this one lives up to the hype; and deserves the four star rating it got. I highly recommend it, you will definitely get your moneys worth in this little gem.<br/><br/>Thanks, Kris L. CocKayne"

","Small time house thieves Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) think they have just found the perfect house to rob and end it all: in the middle of a deserted neighborhood they discover a blind veteran (Stephen Lang) who lives in a house alone and he is sitting on three hundred thousand dollars of cash. Ready to get the money and flee to California, the three enter the house convinced it is going to me smooth and easy when they discover that there might be much more trouble than they anticipated.<br/><br/>At his second full length feature, Fede Alvarez demonstrates a confidence in style and storytelling that is really rare to find and appreciate in a horror picture, 'Don't Breathe' is a masterful effort with many layers and surprises and excellent characters.<br/><br/>What apparently seems to be a simple, straightforward premise is turned on its head and made into a picture of incredible complexity, which thanks to magnificent craft flows effortlessly as a horror-thriller with a heft in suspense that I had not experienced in a while. The way in which, ironically, the film doesn't let you catch a breath is astonishing. There isn't a moment of calm. Stuff just keeps on happening, obstacle after obstacle you our characters are always in danger, they are never given a dull moment, is simply keeps rolling and you roll with it. The intensity of suspense sustained throughout the whole film is breath taking.<br/><br/>The style of the film to is something really special that deserves a deeper analysis that one that I could give upon a first time viewing. The way the beautiful long tracking shots are used, the use of night cameras, how the editing mirrors each of the characters' status and finally how crude some of the details get, but how fantastically they are handled. The gross out stuff isn't there just to let you have an instinctive reaction, it is there to help the story and the characters evolve and enhance a story world which is incredibly designed.<br/><br/>Finally, what I probably deem the best element of the film is a script that is almost perfect, one of those that subverts your momentary reservations and proves you wrong in every way you possibly thought it could fail. I really mean it, this is possibly the best script of the year, it works on so many levels: the characters are rich, coherent, interesting and three dimensional, the logic is flawless, the narrative drive is climactic, the revelations are surprising and intelligent, most of all the thematic content is unbelievably rich and explosive: the morality questions the film asks are varied and complex and the fact that the film doesn't give answers on some is possibly the most scary element of it all: no one here is either a good or a bad guy, they are all people with a really fuc*ed up dynamic that is grounded in reality and lends itself to a moral debate that is sure to spin your head round and round.<br/><br/>Possibly, my favorite part of this remarkable screenplay is the deep and original humanization of the blind man, Stephen Lang's character. It is very easy to have a flat figure in these films as an antagonist and it could have been even easier here. Yet, Alvarez and Sayagues craft on of the most compelling opponents of recent years, humanizing him in a very unconventional way, making him a strangely sympathetic character, full of surprises and little touches that elevated the entire film.<br/><br/>The film only has a couple of flaws to account for and even then they are all minor: there were two editing cheats that broke continuity and therefore partially took away from the flow and tension of two small moments. Moreover, there are many jump scares in this film, some used intelligently and to great effectiveness, unfortunately a couple were really gratuitous and didn't fit organically. Lastly, this is a real nitpick, but I thought that as beautiful as some of the tracking shots were, I found a couple of brief moments in there to be a little too on the nose in setting up later elements and they could have easily been edited tighter.<br/><br/>This is excellent, intelligent and inspired filmmaking and yet another great horror film from this year and this recent period that, after a stale period in the 2000s, seems to be becoming a new golden age of horror films just like the one we had in the 70s and early 80s."
"MaximumMadness","8","3","7","9 September 2016"," ""Don't Breathe""- A wickedly intense and highly entertaining thriller that delivers the goods despite faltering a bit in the third act.
","Well... that was intense.<br/><br/>""Don't Breathe"" is the brainchild of director Fede Alvarez, who along with his writing partner Rodo Sayagues has crafted one of the more inventive and exciting thrillers of the year, mixing a wonderful sense of all-encompassing paranoia and claustrophobia with a surprisingly dense sense of internal debate about the moral dubiousness of the events taking place. It's a film that has quite a bit going for it, and it has a lot more depth to it than I think many will admit or even accept.<br/><br/>We follow a young group of thieves who are attempting to rob just enough houses to get the money to escape their dreary, going-nowhere lives in Detroit. Chief among them is ""Rocky"" (Jane Levy), who is desperate to escape her abusive family and give her kid-sister a better life that their current situation just cannot afford them. Along with her friends ""Money"" (Daniel Zovatto) and Alex (Dylan Minnette), she takes on the classic ""one last job""- in this case, robbing the house of an elderly blind veteran (Stephen Lang of ""Avatar"" fame) who is allegedly sitting on $300k in cash... a payoff from the family of a young, rich girl who accidentally killed his daughter in a car accident some time prior.<br/><br/>However, despite his visual impairment, it soon becomes aware that the blind man may not be quite as handicapped as the group has believed. And soon enough, the group will be forced into a life-or- death struggle against this tremendous force of nature that will stop at nothing to protect his home and the strange secret that lurks inside of the locked basement...<br/><br/>The strengths of the film really lie in the top-notch sense of suspense that director Alvarez relishes in piling on scene-after- scene, and for the shockingly complex questioning of the morality of the events occurring.<br/><br/>Alvarez- best known for helming the under-appreciated ""Evil Dead"" reboot from 2013- is at the top of his game. His slick sense of composition and movement constantly has you at the edge of your seat, and you'll often literally find yourself holding your breath in dread and anticipation, much as the film's title implores you. Often, I found myself wowed by just how solid his work is here- with camera-work and expert editing that borders on Hitchcockian at times, giving it a near-classical feeling. Bravo, sir. Bravo.<br/><br/>I also was quite taken by how complex the film can be when it tries. While it mainly remains as subtext, there's a constant lingering question at the back of your mind... questioning just who the true villain (or even villains) are given the complex nature of the storyline. Or even if there are any traditional ""heroes"" or ""villains"" in this story? After all, our ""protagonists"" are basically career criminals who are trying to steal from a blind man... At what point does sympathy for someone come or go? At what point does breaking the law become acceptable? And can two wrongs really make a right? Questions like these will be bouncing around in your mind as the film continues through it's varied (and unpredictable) twists and turns. And it added a lot to the experience for me.<br/><br/>And to top it off, the performances are just a ton of fun. Lang steals the show as our antagonist, with minimal lines and an almost purely physical performance that generates sympathy at first before becoming a shocking threat. Levy is likable and really gives her character a sense of pathos, and you identify with her reasoning for doing what she is doing despite condemning it at the same time. Zovatto is a great deal of fun as a bit of a wannabe thug with a chip on his shoulder. And Minnette is a great, sympathetic figure, being the only one of the group who really questions what they're doing.<br/><br/>All that praise being said, I do have to take off a few points for the one major fault of the film- and that is that it does falter quite a bit in the third act. I can't really go into it here without spoiling anything (which I refuse to do), but suffice to say, the film takes a few hard-left turns with twists that are interesting but contrived, and the climax is extremely disjointed. A few key moments almost took me out of the movie completely. But thankfully the first two acts are so enthralling and engrossing, that I could forgive a decidedly mixed- bag climax.<br/><br/>All-in-all, ""Don't Breathe"" is a satisfying and chilling suspense- thriller. It may not be perfect, and it nearly falls apart in the end, but a masterful first and second act, top-notch performances and incredible direction more than make up for this.<br/><br/>I give it a very good 8 out of 10. Head on down to the theater, sit back, and get ready to be scared!"
"BobbyG","6","3","7","29 August 2016"," Don't Breath is a Conundrum
","Don't Breath starts out well with three morally challenged characters attempting to make their way through the world by burglarizing others homes. They decide to rob a blind war veteran (excellent character actor Stephen Lang) of his settlement from the wrongful death of his only daughter. <br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, but at some point you wonder who to root for because the blind veteran (Lang) is concealing a despicable secret in his basement. The thrills are well filmed and fairly predictable. The scariest character in the film is Lang's rottweiler. Lang's blind character must have had sinus issues because he would walk next to unseen burglars and not smell them which I found unrealistic. Supposedly the other senses are heightened when one is missing. Maybe I'm off-base with this criticism. Sometimes I can't smell things due to allergies.<br/><br/>I was hoping for more scares, but maybe I'm jaded from seeing so many horror movies over the years (I'm past middle age). If I had seen this in high school it would probably have been a totally different experience.<br/><br/>The of ending of Don't Breath leaves room for a sequel, although maybe it would be hard for a blind man to track down a woman who robbed him."

","Morally this film disturbed movie. The more ethical young man in the film goes through hell while trying to save the female lead and makes smart moves until her lack of judgment in a crisis inevitably costs him his life. <br/><br/>The female lead is a complete narcissist, as if her childhood trauma justifies her behavior and she ends up making selfish choices, gets her friends killed, and seemingly gets away with robbery and attempted murder. <br/><br/>The scene which probably is emblematic of this day and age is when he tries to artificially inseminate her and she completely freaks out... Her reaction to this was way worse than seeing her friends die. Oh no Ms. Narcissist, you won't be able to selfishly spend all that money you just stole if you're a young mother. If that director wants to accurately depict a rape of sorts than just have her walk around alone in France, Germany, or in dearborn Michigan. <br/><br/>Anyway, there were no morals or positive message of the film. It's almost as if the criminals were glorified and despite the ""killer"" having a girl kidnapped in the basement, his only crime was wanting to have another child and to be left alone."
"JokerReviews","9","3","7","27 August 2016"," Exactly what the trailer advertised
","Its rare nowadays it feels to see a movie trailer that does exactly what it should do and make you want to see a movie, but not only that.. the movie delivers on every single thing I feel this film represented itself as.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe does an amazing job of getting right into the action and not letting up. We only spend a few minutes at most getting to know the main characters, but its more than enough to set the stage and to get the audience to invest in what is going to happen to these characters.<br/><br/>As far as scares go, I would say there were maybe 2 or 3 big scares that made me jump in my seat so maybe if you're looking for something really scary then this may not be for you.<br/><br/>Bottom line without saying anything remotely close to a spoiler, if you watch the theatrical trailer and said to yourself, ""that looks like something I'd watch"", then give it your time. You won't be disappointed."
"Nolafilmmaker","7","3","7","27 August 2016"," Not a bad movie, but definitely overrated
","First, the concept was very original. Three thieves set out to rob a blind man of his money late one evening in a deserted neighborhood while he's sleeping. The film did a decent job of building up suspense, but not quite as good as I'd hoped for a movie like this. I never felt that feeling of dread like ""something bad is on the horizon"" I felt while watching 'Halloween"" or the original 'Friday the 13th'. <br/><br/>Once the main characters break into the house, they soon realize that their piece of cake robbery of a blind man will not be so easy. My biggest problem I had with the film was that the blind man pretty much anticipated the thieves' every move. While this worked the first couple of times, it started to become repetitive and really worked against the film. <br/><br/>Yes, he was a very smart war veteran with heightened senses of hearing and smell (worked for the film). Yes, his military training gave him an advantage (worked for the film). But over and over, the characters would try to escape, and he would be there waiting for them at the precise time and location when they arrived. It's almost like I got the feeling the writers wanted to make this character absolutely perfect, with no flaws, weaknesses or mistakes. <br/><br/>That to me, just didn't ring true in this situation. I won't spoil it, but this was especially true near the end when it really seemed like the blind man had superhuman powers to escape any situation.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent movie bogged down by its unrealistic character."
"NutzieFagin","7","3","7","27 August 2016"," A Deadly Blind Man's Bluff
","Anyone ever wonder how a blind person ""views"" a movie? <br/><br/>I have been dating a blind guy for some years now. What you would do is get a device called ""audio description"" (ask for it at the box office.) It is required by ALL theaters to have it due to the Handicap Law. But sometimes--theaters do not and it doesn't always work. It is about the size of a Walkman and descriptions are given to the wearer about the scenes and action going on in the movie. If you are taking a blind person---They definitely WILL need this device.<br/><br/>But anyhow...my ""blind date"" heard about the movie and wanted to ""see"" it. Don't Breathe is a movie that contains a lot of action and plot twists. The movie action and scenes move very quickly and to the point. Three punk teens are involved in a burglary ring. They make there vocation by breaking in homes, robbing and vandalizing them. For some reason, I don't know how but because of their lives--one girl named Rocky, a struggling abused single mother, one boy named Alex who lives in the shadow of his successful father (who owns a burglar alarm business--it's how Alex gets his info)and one common thief named Money that you tend to feel that they are somewhat justified for their crimes. But Alex gets some info about some blind war vet with a lot of money in his house. Perfect score, right?<br/><br/>WRONG! the blind vet turns out to be a homicidal maniac who is driven mad about the death of his daughter. The blind guy is VERY skilled with a gun and he uses his other senses to survive this home invasion. It I definitely no cake walk robbing this guy.<br/><br/>My blind date was amused somewhat about this blind vet turned into a ""Super Blink"" He knew just how to protect himself and he did no the basic skills they teach the blind for everyday life. (Blind people listen very accurately and count steps and doorways in homes.) The violence is there---by today's standards and the gore factor is slim but the action twists and turns are abundant. Maybe a lot of hokum --killing people and beating them and they STILL get up. I won't give away the ending--for some reason it give me a strange feeling--but I can see a sequel possibly.<br/><br/>So I would recommend it--good summer suspense that is not boring."
"shandagimson11","8","4","11","27 August 2016"," EXCELLENT - But that ending... *SPOILER*
","Yes there is spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>First off, this isn't a horror movie it is more of a thriller. ""Don't Breathe"" lives up to its title. The camera work and sound is amazing, you actually feel the actors trying not to breathe throughout the film which makes you want to hold your breath. <br/><br/>Jane Levy is amazing once again as a horror-lead, scream queen and Stephen Lang just BLEW MY MIND! You need to watch this movie just for him.<br/><br/>OK, that ending. It's not terrible, definitely not what I expected, but definitely could have been better. Why the writers thought Rocky escaping happily with her daughter and the Blind Man's money was a good idea, I don't know. Obviously that's what the viewers want to happen, but in ""movie world"" it's just not supposed to end that way. Here are MY opinions on how the movie should have ended;<br/><br/>1 - It is about a week later and she is at the airport with her daughter, ready to break free to California like she promised her kid at the beginning of the movie. She sees the news on TV while waiting at the airport about the robbery and how the Blind Man said no belongings were taken. She hears that her flight is boarding and turns around to her daughter but she is gone, implying that she was taken by the Blind Man because Rocky took something of his (money and unborn baby) and he wanted a child.<br/><br/>2 - At the beginning of the movie we see the Blind Man dragging Rocky down the middle of the road, she is unconscious and he is obviously bringing her somewhere. This would have been amazing if at the end of the movie she had ended up giving him a child and as promised, he returned her to the world after 9 months, hence dragging her ""home"".<br/><br/>Aside from the ending, it is a must see thriller!"

I only don't give this movie a 1 because of how much some idiot spent making it, and the people who legitimately put in the hard work trying to polish this turd film. <br/><br/>The film starts with some scummy thieves making a plan to break into some old veterans house who lives in the ghetto and steal a bunch of insurance money. Fast forward through a film full of blatant plot holes, horrible continuity, and a 60+ year old super hero blind rapist man who can take direct hits from sledgehammers to the face and still be able to not only shoot accurately but escape from handcuffs by flexing and busting out. Don't forget crazy old rapists superhero do<br/><br/>companion who can teleport free of chains and is able to digest large amounts of sleeping meds with little to no side effects. <br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/>The ending is also ridiculous and full of holes. Multiple homicides and the FBI doesn't find the rape dungeon with bodies in the floor? Somehow superhero rapist man gets off free. LMFAO. The jump scares in this film aren't even that good and that's all it has going for it. <br/><br/>If you're into fantasy horror films that hold little to no footing in reality this isn't too horrible of a film.<br/><br/>If you like films that have a sense of reality in them then don't waste your time."

It's certainly got some logic gaps that you have to ignore, and things like 'why this blind ex-military man has all this money is he on the only house on an abandoned area in Detroit city block with no one else living there. there seemed no proper logic that why despite of many chances the woman did not attack the blind man, and get rid off the house."

She agrees completely when she finds out he's a blind vet. Agreed the vet should have been jailed but they just couldn't leave the money. Her greed gets her two boyfriends killed and she gets to keep it all. No problem all the dead bodies this robbery left in it's wake. If she had an ounce of morality she would have left the money and waited for the police. Too bad all this talent was wasted on a plot that makes NO sense.<br/><br/>I want a refund."

📜 Plot : When 3 Robbers plan to Rob a rich blind oldman , things go out of control when the blind man hunts the robbers.
.
👨‍⚖️ Review : Don't Breathe is one hell of a thriller. Its filled with tension and chilling scenes from the get go. The movie gears up without wasting time and sets the mood of a classic thriller. An simple robbery gone wrong and the after a time you feel sympathy for robbers and root for them to survive after the blind man turns rogue. An Edge of the seat classic from Fede Alvarez where he doesn't focus of jump scares, the horror is rather because of the blind man. Background Sounds of Robbers breathing in fear sends chills down your spine.<br/><br/>Stephen Lang at 64 looks is lethal and brutal as the blind man. Jane Levy shines with a incredible performance with accurate expressions of panic and fear. Dylan as Alex too was very good. A Overall Classic Thriller.
.
👍Goods : Stephen Lang as the blind Man is Ruthless , ghastly and Brilliant. Haunting and Nerve Recking Scenes and Unexpected twist in the ending .
.
.
👎 Bads : Couldn't Find One

","Dont Breathe is that rare film I have seen, which took my breath away. It is a fine piece of art, about three people who go to rob a blind man's house. But that man turns out to be more dangerous than expected. Like their previous venture, Evil Dead, this one has very little blood. I really admire that part, for, blood would clearly be a misfit in this film.
I loved everything in this film from the performances, to the tense scenes that unknowingly took me to the edge of the seat. The atmosphere was dark and unsettling, the cinematography was good. They managed to do everything,in a film like this, to impress the audience. Skipping, Don't Breathe, would be quite a sin.

","I actually enjoyed this one but it does fly off into ""ok that doesn't make a lot of sense"" territory sometimes. It definitely requires you to kind of turn off your brain and just accept some things every once in a while.<br/><br/>The entire movie happens around one small house and I have to say this was all pretty well done. Everything is set up at the beginning of the movie so you're never left asking, ""Wait why is there a gun under the bed?"" The first half hour or so really does have you on the very edge of your seat wondering what's gonna happen next and a lot of the silent moments throughout the film succeed in making one hold their breath.<br/><br/>The characters are all pretty unlikable people but they have their redeeming qualities which, I thought, was actually quite refreshing. They're robbers planning to rob a blind old war veteran, they're SUPPOSED to be bad, unlikable people but we're still supposed to care if they die or not and the film succeeds in creating a bit of sympathy for them. You're left between ""I hope they get out safe"" and ""yeah they deserve what's coming"" a lot of the time. Also, the lack of an ""I've always loved you"" between Rocky and Alex is one cliché I'm happy the filmmakers managed to resist.<br/><br/>The pregnant rich woman chained up in the basement seemed a little unnecessary and ridiculous and I personally think the movie could have done without that and the man attempting to impregnate one of the protagonists with a turkey baster. The plot would have been better without adding all that in my opinion. Also some of the blind veteran's lines seemed a little bit silly when it comes time for him to speak.<br/><br/>All in all, a decent movie that's definitely enjoyable but has its flaws."

","Honestly think this film was brilliant. Stephen Lang puts in the performance of his career as the potentially iconic blind man, Jane Levy plays possibly my favourite final girl of the past 2 decades, she has relatable motive and is played flawlessly. Dylan Minnette was another nice surprise in this film, once again his character is quite relatable and you start to feel sorry for his character once you realise he's only roped himself into what he does for a girl that will never love him back. The cinematography is possibly the thing that holds this film together though. 99% of the film takes place within the house and as a result we get some very claustrophobic and clever camera work. Overall I think this is easily one of the better horror films in recent years and has earned itself a place on my Blu-Ray shelf."

It all seems easy enough, perhaps, too easy. Once inside the house, everything hits the fan. Suspenseful and full of surprises, this movie provides almost non-stop thrills, chills, and gasp-out-loud moments!

It's basically a home invasion movie with a twist, three young people break into a blind army veterans home to steal money but it all turns into a nightmare as they are trapped in there and have to fight for their life. ""Don't Breathe"" is a horror flick with - aside from a unique story - some good acting, especially from Stephen Lange and Dylan Minnette. While it becomes slightly repetitive in the end, the film is still a good thriller/horror with jump scares, thrills, and disturbing twists."

","Good, fun and effectively suspenseful and tense movie. well directed. good premise utilized well. but there were a bunch of questionable parts (1 viewing)<br/><br/>
SPOILERS<br/><br/>
some questionable parts were how the dog was able to push him through the window if there were bars, how they showed the guy getting stabbed with garden scissors but then wasn't stabbed later, can't remember the others. and i didn't really like the ending, i get that his hearing is probably highly sensitive so the alarm might be disorienting, but he's been firing a gun inside a house the whole movie, that's way louder than an alarm, which causes him to completely lose his composure. this probably would have been a 3.5 without these turn-offs"

","What can I say? Overall, this's actually not a bad movie, but, you know, not interesting to me as well.
One blind man with those strength, as a villain. And the thiefs, especially the girl, she got her own story and reason to do, whatever, stealling.
We have so many situations from that source, horrify silence moments, to develop, but the movie lack them.
Also the basement keep secrets was opened too soon, and so we all know everything.
And all the characters only have one mission, not run away out of the house, but, run to the door or sth, to be captured. too predictable.
The only thing I like from the movie is acting of the girl and the blind man, so good acting.
There're one character has a interesting story but they missed it, that's Alex's dad. I hoped they develop his story but no, they didn't
SO THIS IS JUST AN ACCEPTABLE HORROR MOVIE, WITH GOOD ACTING AND SIMPLE STORY. No more, no less.

Trying to force morally ambiguous decisions onto the viewer, and failed attempts at character development and moments that were meant to make the viewer ""sympathize"" with the ""heroine"".<br/><br/>The progression was so frustrating, because we're expected to sympathize with this woman and her reasons behind theft, yet she's as hypocritical as any other villain, and even worse; she does NOTHING but be a burden to the other characters. Also, we were given an ambiguous ending in which we're supposed to feel relieved that she survived and was able to fulfil her ""relatable and human"" goals, when she didn't think twice about stealing from a blind man, begging for her life after she tried to kill him and assaults him again, oh and did I mention that she was never in any real danger?<br/><br/>These writers need to have a look at the South Korean film ""The Chaser"", to see how a ""morally ambiguous"" film should be done."

","A trio of thieves decide to break to break into the home of a blind man (superbly played with fierce intensity by Stephen Lang) who turns out to be very resourceful and hence quite dangerous.<br/><br/>Director Fred Alvarez, who also co-wrote the tight script with Rodo Sayagues, relates the gripping story at a brisk pace, adroitly crafts plenty of nerve-wracking claustrophobic tension, and throws in a few dandy sick twists. Moreover, Alvarez brings an intriguing moral ambiguity to the picture by making the blind man someone who's anything but a harmless innocent cripple. Jane Levy as the desperate Rocky, Dylan Minnette as the antsy Alex, and Daniel Zovatto as the cocky Money all do commendable work in their roles, but this film clearly belongs to Lang's impressively ferocious and frightening portrayal of a sightless war veteran loner who's quite a nasty and scary piece of work. Pedro Luque's sharp and fluid cinematography provides a pleasing glossy sheen. The spirited shivery score by Roque Banos hits the rattling spot. An on the money nail biter."

","While the 'Don't Breathe (2016)' focuses far more on suspense than gore, it also features a fair amount of visceral violence that feels incredibly impactful thanks mainly to its lasting consequences. This isn't surprising considering it comes from Fede Alvarez, the man behind several blood-splattered movies such as 'Evil Dead (2013)'. It's this brutality that makes its villain a fairly frightening, incredibly ruthless foe despite the fact that he's completely blind, something that he uses to his advantage on a number of occasions - especially during a few fantastic 'night-vision' sequences. The story actually owes somewhat of a debt to 'Wait Until Dark (1967)', a fantastically suspenseful feature in which Audrey Hepburn plays a blind woman terrorised by home-invaders, but the focal roles are here reversed. It certainly isn't predictable and it manages to open up its small situation in an interesting and unexpected way, bridging the gap between a more traditional crime-thriller and a straight-up horror in its second half. It also has the distinct difficulty of featuring generally 'unlikable' protagonists, which makes it all the more impressive that we come to care for (most of) them pretty quickly. The exciting and tense action sequences are expertly set-up to be as clear and propulsive as possible, which are what really drive this short but 'sweet' experience. 8/10"
"pete-murphy97","8","0","0","3 October 2018"," Painstaking at times, but a true original
","""Don't Breathe"" is a true original in the ""cat and mouse"" kind of horror flick - the blind guy concept has really been put to work here in a polished way with a pretty good cast to match (Dylan Minnette being the most notable name in the lineup). <br/><br/>Similar to the horror/thriller ""Hush"", which was also released in 2016, this movie uses a sensory disability as its primary theme. 
With ""Hush"" the protagonist was obvious, in this movie it's much less clear - I think that's a good thing; moral ambiguity is food for thought.<br/><br/>The Blind Man, portrayed by Stephen Lang, is an ex-military guy who, despite his disability, has a constant aura of sheer intimidation and unpredictability lingering below the surface of 20/20 vision. He's a crack-shot, and the viewer is made to know it - this guy is a sharp, butterfly-floating, bee-stinging, edge-of-your-seat kind of threat. He's maimed; but if he gets you, he gets you good. <br/><br/>The other characters were almost underdeveloped, the focus shifted too quickly from building character background and motive development into the house scenes, but the unyielding roller-coaster of the latter scenes more than made up for a sparse beginning.<br/><br/>More than a few times there were painstaking decisions made by certain characters, a lack of common sense, or situations where I felt the producers forced an inorganic or predictable outcome for the sake of suspense, to thrill, to scare the audience or to segue more easily into other scenes, all forgivable.<br/><br/>A thought-provoking ending rounded off a film that had outlasted its welcome by its later scenes.<br/><br/>A standout film in a genre populated with underwhelming releases, I went in ""blind"" and was pleasantly surprised by what I could see - 7.7/10."

","I had put this movie off due to it not being my preferred brand of horror, but now I regret not seeing it the minute it came out.<br/><br/>This movie has a bit of a flat start compared to some of its contemporaries, but once we get our first bite of the main plot it becomes incredibly clear that every shot and scene is executed with direction and purpose. The stakes are continuously raised as the plot unfolds, and with a modest runtime of 1hr28min, we get all this without any scenes lingering longer than they need to.<br/><br/>As with the plot, I was unsure about the acting in the opening few scenes, but again, I ate my words as soon as the action started. I could feel every bit of dread that the characters were feeling, and Stephen Lang's terrifying villain only added to that dread. Dialogue wasn't a huge part of this movie, but I felt that it didn't have to be due to how well the story unfolded while keeping the chit-chat at a minimum.<br/><br/>The setting of this movie played an important part, and it is made clear how important its role is going to be from the moment we first walk through the door. Once we are shown the layout of where the action is going to take place, then we start getting a great variety of scares and super tense moments, with most of them causing more clenching than jumping, which is really nice to see in a modern horror.<br/><br/>Absolutely not one to miss if you enjoy tension and suspense, and I will definitely be recommending this to more than a few people."

","Don't Breathe is a flawed film, with weak characters.<br/><br/>Why make this film? What can the viewer get out of it? The characters offer very little beyond their present actions and the third member who died early, didn't fit. They would not get to this position this trio, as a lot of trust would be required. The ending adds value to the film, with the constant life altering decisions the characters have to make. Albeit silly decisions, because you wouldn't stop to gloat or sit on the ground next to the car to take a breather, when the dog's trapped.

"sddavis63","8","0","0","20 August 2018"," Outlandish But An Effective And Suspenseful Thriller
","Perhaps the best thing about ""Don't Breathe"" is the twist that takes place and leaves you wondering who - if anyone - you should be rooting for. For the first half of the movie, this is a pretty standard type of home invasion story. Three teenagers have made a career of sorts breaking into houses. As the story begins they've decided to target a blind man (a helpless blind man!) who they believe has a huge amount of money hidden inside his house. Well, it turns out that the blind man isn't quite as helpless as we might have thought. Things go wrong inside the house pretty fast. You start to expect a sort of cat and mouse thriller as this blind man sets out to get these no good kids. Except ... I don't want to give it away. Suffice to say there are a lot of secrets inside this blind man's house - enough that by the end you don't really know who the good guys are - or even if there is a good guy. It's a good (if outlandish) story, full of twists and turns that keeps you guessing pretty much the entire way through.<br/><br/>Director Fede Alvarez did a good job with the setting, using the house - dark, mysterious and foreboding (because what would a blind man need with light anyway) - and its' neighbourhood - one of Detroit's abandoned neighbourhoods, with this blind man being the only one left in about a four square block radius, if I remember correctly. So, whether inside or outside the house, it's pretty isolated. The performances were very good. Stephen Lang was superb as the blind man, and I thought Jane Levy was very good as Rocky - the most sympathetic of the three teens, perhaps because we know the most about her home life, which isn't happy and which she dreams of escaping with her little sister.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that the plot is, indeed, outlandish - but the story is exciting and it has a lot of suspense. The ending of the movie clearly sets up a sequel, which has already been announced - which suggests to me that they're going to take the blind man too far. But who knows. Maybe it will work. This film did work - and it worked very well. (8/10)"
"life-of-hapiness","6","0","0","6 August 2018"," Good but not perfect
","I loved that this horror had the villain as a blind guy which made this very different from other home invasion movies. Also with the man's home who they broke into being from the army and traps them in and takes their lives into their hands it was a good outlook. I also liked how the beginning was shown as a woman being grabbed and dragged down the road and why this was relevant to the movie. <br/><br/>I do wish they showed more gore and that the film had more scare factor even if jump scares as it didn't come across as scary to myself for a horror movie.

They were set up as anti-heroes with good hearts, stuck in an awful situation, but I just couldn't get passed the fact that they were thieves.<br/><br/>I think perhaps in a time where home invasions and burglaries are prevalent in the media and a genuine concern to most homeowners it is hard not to root for the ""bad-guy""<br/><br/>Nothing bad -but not much to be excited about either"

With this, the Conjuring 1&2, Babadook, It follows, Lights Out and Get Out among another have really stood out as well as raising the bar for horror writing and acting. I am so happy that this is the case. If this trend continues maybe more people will take horror more seriously as an art form. Who knows maybe one will get a best picture Oscar soon?<br/><br/>Don't Breathe centres around three thieves. Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money ( Daniel Blanco) who for a number of different reasons want to get enough money to improve their lives. Rocky in particular wants to leave her abusive parents with her younger sister in the hopes of a better life. The answer to all of their prayers seems to come in the form of robbing a blind man's (Stephen Lang) house which supposedly has enough money to solve all their troubles. However once inside the house the blind man as it turns out is not as helpless as he looks.....<br/><br/>Don't breathe takes full advantage of the claustrophobic set of a small, cramped decrepit house. You feel that every corner could result in death; the tiniest creek of a floor board might help the blind man hunt down the three. Director Fede Alvarez takes every opportunity to make the viewer feel on the edge of their seat, make you feel the stress the characters are experiencing knowing how the smallest sound might kill them. Because of this the film has a terrific atmosphere.<br/><br/>The acting too is fantastic, everyone is not only believable in their roles but are able to show just how scared they are when they find themselves in over their head. Alex, Money and Rocky are stupid either and despite their chosen profession are likeable to an extent. Even the Blind man is sympathetic to an extent, even if his motives are questionable. The idea of not making noise to survive is really cleaver and further contributes to some incredibly intense moments, the film again does not waste any of the material the concept has. <br/><br/>I would say that, without going into any spoilers the story suffers from unnecessarily complexity. If the film had just been about the three escaping the house but it adds story elements that at least I feel are not really needed and detracts from the pacing. However it is very personal and I doubt most would be bothered by this. <br/><br/>As a horror movie Don't Breathe is a thrilling watch, as a piece of film making it is a very well made film. I would recommend it."

Even if you think something is finally over, it is most certainly is not. It was put together well so that things didn't get confusing, and that you could follow along easily. I really was really interested the story this movie told. <br/><br/>Acting 4/5<br/><br/>The actors in this movie play their roles very well. Each person seemed aware in the role the had to play and embraced it. In this film there is a lot of intense acting that needs to be done, and they each showed the intensity needed to make this movie better. You can feel the fear of the characters as they are trapped in the house, which makes it a better film. I don't think the producers could've chosen better actors for this movie. Cast:<br/><br/>Stephen Lang- The Blind Man<br/><br/>Jane Levy- Rocky Dylan Minnette- Alex Daniel Zovatto- Money<br/><br/>How Scary: 4/5<br/><br/>The movie Don't Breathe is probably one of the top 3 most intense movies I have ever watched. There is so much to follow and it always keeps you interested enough where you cannot stop watching. You are jumping all throughout the movie whether it's from a dog chasing someone, or watching teens try to find their way through a dark home. <br/><br/>Overall Score 5/5<br/><br/>Overall, Don't Breathe was a great movie. The story line was great, it had great content, and it never bored you. It was easy to follow, and you always had something to look forward to. The actors all played their roles well, and helped make this movie the best it could be."

","At first i liked it. The idea of 3 cocky burglers exploiting a blind but finding a terrible secret and then turning from the hunters to the hunted seemed nice.<br/><br/>But the more i thought about the whole setup and how the movie staged those events - the more flaws.. deal-breaking flaws popped up.<br/><br/>The most problamatic flaw of the movie is the chemistry between the three protagonists. Or rather - the absence of any. It feels very strange how those 3 fit together, how they seem to be friends (?) or how they trust each other enough to pull off those heists. The movie presents the viewer with some sort of motivation for the female lead to go on those break ins (which is greed/or breaking out of poverty) - but all that is blatantly stereotypical and also needless.<br/><br/>Then there is the actual execution of their big plan to raid this blind mans home. A plan so flawed and idiotic that one has to wonder if those three spend any thought on planning the event. <br/><br/>A little bit of information gathering and intel - which cannot be that hard to come by, considering the nature of the man they attempt to raid, - would have gone very far. Furthermore a neighbourhood that seems perfectly fine with several gunshots fired in the night seems rather special. Gunshots are very loud .. and while i can understand that the sound gets muffled when fired within a big house - quite some shots were fired outside. <br/><br/>To make it short - had they spend even a minimal amount of time scouting the premise - they would have found out that.<br/><br/><ul><li>the guy lives alone and has no house keeper - that means he must go shopping by himself - meaning that he would be away for quite a long time, leaving the house unattended during the day (you know, when its bright outside)</li></ul><br/><br/>Not only would they have been surprised by a watchdog, but they could have dealt with the heist easily. That is especially odd, since they seemed to do the other break ins when the owners were out - during daytime. So one has to wonder ... why would they do this ones home at night - while the owner is at home?<br/><br/>Then there is the problem with the blind man. I can understand that he is a tough guy alright. I can also understand that he may move with quite some certainty in his own home. BUT .. his own home is a wreck. What a blind person needs most is to have his all his stuff in its place to be able to navigate securely. Not only is the house way too run down and stuffed full of garbage. But he also moves too fast. We briefly see him rush to around to lock the house down - which he does reasonably fast. But there are scenes where he seems to move from the basement to the upper floor in what feels like an instant. <br/><br/>Well - i could go one and on with plot holes - but the point of it is... the more you think about it the more infuriating the story becomes. <br/><br/>The old guys motivation is creepy and scary enough - and a great foundation - but the protagonists were weak and the whole setup rather lame. <br/><br/>I would give that movie a 5/10 for being just about average. It is not a great disappointment - but it certainly is not a breathtaking revelation."
"drownnnsoda","8","3","8","23 September 2016"," Relatively minimalist but high-octane thriller
","""Don't Breathe"" follows a trio of delinquents who plan to rob a wealthy blind man whose house sits alone in an abandoned, derelict Detroit neighborhood. What seems like a relatively easy heist turns progressively worse as the young adults find the tables turned on them.<br/><br/>In a decade that has offered little in terms of high(ish)-caliber horror-thrillers, ""Don't Breathe"" stands out, not necessarily as an exemplar of excellence, but at least as an example of a hard-edged thriller that is head and shoulders above the majority of its peers. Fede Alvarez, who gave us the divisive 2013 ""Evil Dead"" remake (a film which, for what it's worth, I thought was unfairly bashed), returns as writer/director, teaming up again with Jane Levy, who also starred in the ""Evil Dead.""<br/><br/>Conceptually speaking, ""Don't Breathe"" is straightforward, almost minimalist; there is no pretense to speak of, and after a brief but sufficient exposition, the film jettisons its audience into the cat-and-mouse dilemma that dominates its remainder. Somewhat of a quasi-inversion of the home invasion film, the script allows room for moral ambiguities in spite of its conceptual and narrative straightforwardness, toying with the audience's sympathies and facing us with situations which challenge the moral compass. This is of course not to say that ""Don't Breathe"" is necessarily a deep psychological thriller, because it's not—the primary focus here is maintaining suspense—but there is food for thought amid the action.<br/><br/>Solid performances from Stephen Lang and Jane Levy help carry the narrative, with Lang as an ice-cold, disturbed veteran and Levy as a poverty-stricken young woman whose desperation jeopardizes both her and her friends' lives. The film is nicely shot and features some impressive cinematography, including a noteworthy single-take pan through the house that follows each of the three protagonists as they search for the man's stockpile of cash. I did feel that the film's final act edged into predictable exploitation territory, where shock value and redundancy came close to overriding the general tension that the first hour had done so nicely, but the final two scenes were solid enough to carry the film home.<br/><br/>All in all, I was impressed by this film; not as a groundbreaking piece of cinema, but as a generally well-plotted, candid thriller that manages not to steer too far off course for its own good. It's not often that such a simple concept is done with so much finesse, let alone is able to keep its fuel burning. A definite standout thriller of the decade. 8/10."

","The trailer for this film looked great, including the tagline, a play on the phrase ""In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king"", it was ""In the land of the dark, the blind man is king"", and it had a good title, so I hoped for the best, directed by Fede Alvarez (Evil Dead). Basically in Detroit, delinquents Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) make a living from breaking into homes secured by Alex's father's security company and selling the items they steal. However their buyer does not give them a fair price, Rocky dreams of moving with her little sister Diddy (Emma Bercovici) to California to escape their neglectful mother and her alcoholic boyfriend. Money gets a tip about an Army veteran living in an abandoned Detroit neighbourhood, he was given a settlement after wealthy young woman Cindy Roberts (Franciska Töröcsik) killed his daughter in a car accident, the man $300,000 in cash in his house, he is a Blind Man (Avatar's Stephen Lang), but they decide to go ahead with the break in. That night, the three approach the house, drug the Blind Man's dog, all entrances are locked, but Rocky fits through a small window and lets the other two in, they search the house but are unable to find the money, Money shoots the lock off a door, assuming the cash is behind it. The Blind Man is woken by the noise, he attacks Money and kills him with his own gun, Rocky hiding in the closet witnesses the Blind Man open a safe containing the money, after he leaves Alex finds her, they open the safe and steal the money. While the Blind Man deduces from other pairs of shoes that there are more intruders, Rocky and Alex find a door leading to the basement, there they are surprised to find a girl restrained and gagged in a homemade padded cell, after seeing a newspaper article about the car accident, they realise she is Cindy. They free her, but the Blind Man surprises them, he opens fire and mistakenly kills Cindy, Rocky and Alex escape into the cellar, the Blind Man enraged at Cindy's death shuts off the lights, there is a struggle, Alex knocks out the Blind Man and Rocky follows him back up to the house. All the exits have been blocked, Rocky makes her through the ventilation system, while Blind Man's dog attacks Alex, he falls out of the window onto a skylight, the Blind Man captures him and appears to stab him with pruning shears, the dog then pursues Rocky through the vents, she is captured by the Blind Man. Rocky wakes up restrained and gagged in the basement, where the Blind Man reveals that Cindy was carrying his child in order to replace the one she killed, he attempts to artificially inseminate Rocky with a turkey baster filled with his semen, but Alex survived, he knocks him out and handcuffs him. With their blood all over the house, Rocky and Alex know they cannot call the police, they attempt to leave, but the Blind Man escapes his restraints and fatally shoots Alex, Rocky manages to escape, but is chased by the dog, she manages to trap the dog in her car trunk, but the Blind Man is captured by the Blind Man again. Back in the house Rocky is able to disorient the Blind Man by setting off the loud house alarm system, she beats him with a crowbar, knocking him unconscious into the basement, she flees as the police are arriving. In the end, Rocky with the money is preparing to leave Detroit with Diddy on a train to Los Angeles, before boarding she sees a report that the Blind Man survived and is in a stable condition, about killing two intruders in his house, but there is no mention of Rocky or the stolen money. Also starring Christian Zagia as Raul, Katia Bokor as Ginger, Sergej Onopko as Trevor and Olivia Gillies as Blind Man's Daughter. Lang certainly is frightening as the man blinded by a grenade explosion but with a good sense of hearing, he quickly becomes far from sympathetic, it is a simple concept, a robbery gone wrong when the perpetrators get more than they bargained for with the victim turning out to be a scary man with dark secrets, but there are a good amount of bloody and jumpy moments, overall it is a most worthwhile horror. Very good!"

","Ending the summer season in horror style, Don't Breathe is about three teenagers robbing houses where they come across a blind army veteran who has quite a lot of money, but not all as it seems because this blind man...is Stephen Lang. The same Stephen Lang who tried to destroy Pandora in Avatar...you just know what you are getting yourself involved in. Right from the opening scene, the tension is building and throughout the 88 minute runtime the suspense just does not stop. This is simply edge of your seat cinema, less horror but more thriller. The performances were great, obviously Stephen Lang is a badass (I mean what were the teenagers thinking!? Don't mess with him!) but the robbers themselves played understated performances, each character with their own backstory which were developed enough. The direction from Fede Alvarez just oozed confidence, he knew exactly what he wanted to do and he did it. Excellent camera work (a nice long shot near the beginning of the film, I was impressed!), great lighting to create the atmosphere and good editing to create those jump scares. Speaking of jump scares, there are a few of them however I would not class this film as a horror, it is more a thriller. I was not scared (and to be honest, no one in my cinema was either) but we were all on the edge of our seats. Whilst some might find that a flaw, if anything it is just a misrepresentation of the movie. One flaw that this film does have is that all the characters are bad people and therefore not likable, which means it is difficult to become attached to them. Overall, Don't Breathe was a great suspenseful thriller with sublime technical aspects and brilliant performances albeit if the characters are not likable.<br/><br/><ul><li>Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</li></ul>"

","I'm not sure why 'Don't Breathe' is praised so much. This movie is nothing special really if you're familiar with the genre. It doesn't have anything to offer that wasn't done before and often done better. Even though the movie is entertaining, it is far from groundbreaking. It's not even very thrilling and there's hardly any horror in it. It's just an average genre movie with an average plot and average acting. So what's the deal with the exuberantly positive ratings?<br/><br/>I'm pretty disappointed because Fede Alvarez's previous movie, 'Evil Dead' (2013), is one of my all-time favorite horror movies and one of the greatest horror remakes ever made if you ask me. I see little of that excellent filmmaking Alvarez displayed in 'Evil Dead' in this movie. It's really a shame and I hope that I will enjoy Alvarez's next movie more than 'Don't Breathe.'"
"RLTerry1","Null","3","8","30 August 2016"," A heart-pounding heist-gone-horrifically-wrong thriller!
","'Don't' visit Detroit. ""Don't Breathe"" is a brilliant horror film that will keep your adrenaline pumping and keep you guessing from the beginning of Act II to the final cut to black. Crossing into different sub-genres of horror, this movie will capture your attention every moment and catch you off guard every chance it gets. Although there is no scientific evidence for the collective belief that when one sense is removed that the others take over, it does make for a fantastic plot device that will greatly heighten your own senses while watching this efficiently ruthless movie. This is definitely a horror film to experience on the big screen–don't wait for Prime, Play, RedBox, or HBONow. The most terrifying element of this movie is the feeling of being trapped in the dark. Just as the characters are experiencing the labyrinth that is the home of the intended robbery victim, you will also feel helpless as the terror unfolds in front of your eyes and you have nowhere to hide. Going into this film, you may think it simply a new twist on the home invasion sub-genre of horror, but you will soon find out that there is so much more to this movie than meets the eye. While some films– horror or not–are often guilty of wasting time, especially in the first acts respectively, Sony-Screen Gems' Don't Breath is a cinematic claustrophobic roller-coaster that includes one terrifying turn after another. In other news, if you're looking to buy a house, this film includes some great shots of your next neighborhood in Detroit.<br/><br/>With all their friends gone, three young people are desperately trying to leave the city they once called home. Turning to petty theft and larceny, Money (Daniel Zovatto), Rocky (Jane Levy), and Alex (Dylan Minnette) receive a tip from a local crime boss that there is a house with enough money to get them all out the city. After learning that the home is inhabited by a blind old man (Stephen Lang), the small band of thieves conclude that this will be an easy gig. With the aid of security codes and keys from Alex's father's security business, who manages the few inhabited homes in Detroit, Alex, Money, and Rocky plan the heist. After the robbery goes 180 degrees in the opposite direction, this supposedly easy target now has them trapped. And a terrifying realization will have them holding their breath as to not get caught or worse. Two parts home invasion, one part heist, and three parts horror, this terrifying movie will have you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>For the sake of not giving anything away in the movie, I am going to keep this review on the shorter side. Sometimes the best horror movies are those that have a very simple premise. And this is definitely one of those. The heist genre is one of the oldest in the cinematic handbook. After all The Great Train Robbery (1903) was the first American film to pioneer composite editing, on- location shooting, and dynamic camera movement. Although not the very first motion picture, it is among the first and considered by many to be the first commercially successful motion picture. Early on in the dawn of commercial cinema, horror was quite prominent, thanks to Carl Laemmle who founded Universal Pictures. Don't Breathe includes elements from many different films in the official sub-genres of horror; but to explore each of those would give away some terrifyingly morbid plot twists in the movie. The point is, this film borrows from both horror and non-horror films that helped to forge the foundation of commercially successful cinema. It's of no surprise, after watching it, that is will likely do very well this weekend. Given that it has an August release date, I was concerned that–as good as it looked in the trailers–that it would not play out very well because the best horror films, this time of year, are released in latter September and October to make way for Halloween! But, I was totally wrong; I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Speaking of Halloween, this movie would make an absolutely perfect addition to Universal's Halloween Horror Nights next year if they can secure the rights from Sony Pictures.<br/><br/>Regarding the location of the film, this is just the latest in horror films (as well as other genres) to use the motor city as the backdrop for a violent story. As a producer, myself, I realize that part of the draw to that location is the simple fact that it is incredibly cheap to shoot there. The other part is that it effortlessly sets up a feeling of uneasiness from an aerial shot of the city or suburbs. Not entirely sure that having horror films and other violent movies set in your city, now in ruins, will do much for inspiring entrepreneurs or other professionals to relocate; but it does showcase the city as a welcoming place for filmmakers who seek to pursue their respective dreams of success at visual storytelling. Ghost towns have often been used in westerns, horror, and treasure hunt movies; and without having to go to a foreign country, there really is a perfect modern ghost town right here in the US. Whether it needs to serve as a location that symbolizes greatness in ruins or to instantly prompt apprehension or unbalance, it is a diverse landscape upon which to build a story.<br/><br/>Just when you think the film is over, it will throw you for a loop! Looking for a fantastic film to watch on a date or with your friends this weekend, then I highly recommend Don't Breathe. It's the perfect film to usher in this most macabre time of year. Not defaulting to gore and jump scares, this movie is a beautifully and meticulously crafted work of cinema that will genuinely cause your blood to race and keep your senses on edge."
"arungeorge13","7","2","5","5 June 2017"," Review – Don't Breathe (2016) ..90 minutes of cleverly crafted tension and thrills! [3.5/5]
","Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez (who gained popularity through his underwhelming debut feature which happened to be the reboot of the Sam Raimi classic 'Evil Dead') returns strongly and leaves a lasting impression with the home-invasion thriller ""Don't Breathe"". It is about a group of three thieves who wanna fulfill their American dream of making big money and moving to a big city. In order for this to happen though, the trio must rob the house of a blind man (played to the hilt by Stephen Lang of 'Avatar').<br/><br/>The proceedings that take place over the course of that one night actually take up a bulk of the film and this is precisely where the writer/director has shown immense potential in thrilling, terrifying and shocking the viewer. ""Don't Breathe"" isn't a film that relies purely on jump scares but the few ones present are placed at apt junctures and bring in the required impact. The atmosphere is spine- chilling, set mostly within the confines of a house that is located quite far away from the bustling city in a crumbling uninhabited neighborhood, so we the audience are told in advance that noise is not going to gather any public attention. But hey, the 'blind man' in the house isn't a weakling either. He's aroused quickly by even the quaintest of creaks or the sound of exhaling breath. What happens when he springs into action to defend himself and the reveal of a certain personal mystery regarding the blind dude apart from the money that the trio want to get their hands on, is played out in sixty-plus minutes of totally ruthless, claustrophobia-inducing frenzy. Stephen Lang is nothing short of tremendous, and plays the 'blind man' in near- flawless fashion. The guy's got amazing screen- presence. The trio played by Jane Levy (of the 'Evil Dead' reboot), Dylan Minnette (of 'Goosebumps') and Daniel Zovatto (of 'It Follows') are quite impressive as well with the former two occupying more screen-time (due to the nature of the screenplay!).<br/><br/>The cinematography is solid (close-up shots in the pitch-dark portion stood out!) and although this is a film that involves a lot of physicality, and perspective-juggling, Pedro Luque handles it brilliantly (no shaky cam!). The storyline is not something that is completely original; if you simply go through the synopsis, you are bound to feel as if this film could be a cliché-filled exercise in torture-porn ( a relentless rehash of the magnificent Jeremy Saulnier thriller 'Green Room', offering cheap thrills like in 'The Collector' and bucketfuls of gore like in 'Saw'.) but Fede Alvarez gives you a completely engaging cinematic piece that tries to bend the viewers' minds in the quirkiest ways possible. The Sound and Editorial department deserve special praise.<br/><br/>Once the trio breaks into the house, the viewer is constantly kept on the edge of the seat largely owing to the excellent performances, a screenplay that is determined to shell out thrill after thrill after thrill (maybe a few loopholes here and there but doesn't matter), fantastic sound design and some clever direction. Honestly, I did not find Fede's 'Evil Dead' reboot impressive at all (felt that the shock value was less dependent on characters or atmosphere but on excessive gore-spill), so I did not have really high expectations about this flick. This time however, it's a completely different scenario. Along with Mike Flanagan and Dan Trachtenberg, Fede Alvarez is going to occupy a spot on my list of favorite thriller directors of 2016.<br/><br/>The less you know about the movie, the better. Enjoy this R-rated thriller and get your adrenaline pumping to good effect!"

","The most difficult was not enter the movie theater, the most difficult is to get out alive from it. From the second one to eighty-eight minute: this is the amount of time you will be suffocated - literally, holding the breath - within the asphyxiate and perturbing home invasion of one of the greatest of modern horror, Fede Alvarez. He is proudly latino, Alvarez managed a swift leap to the prodigious Hollywood by means of a sci-fi short uploaded on Youtube in 2009 called ""Panic Attack!"", basic but supreme posed an invasion of robots in Montevideo, Uruguay. A few weeks later, Ghost House Pictures proposed him to direct the coveted remake of ""Evil Dead"", colossal work considered as the official feature film debut of the talented director within the American film. After the high expectations that he reaped after the almost perfect cinematic experience in 2013, the Uruguayan gets into the field of the thriller genre for obfuscate us with a suggestion as simple as complex, a cult film and a clear sign that the brilliant and original minds still exist.<br/><br/>From dark first shot in style of 'flashforward', with a slow descent in high-angle towards the focus of attention, ""Don't Breathe"" promises a well-measured ferocious adventure intelligent enough to delight both fans of the genre and adrenaline junkies with psychological and physical horror that will leave you submerged in a catatonic state approximately for the rest of your life. Without the need of an intricate dialogue and subplots which do not give novel anything to the story, the introduction of the main leads happens in the blink an eye, a couple of scenes that will have significant weight along the footage and we are already in, no exit. A young trio with different personal motivations perpetrate private properties of the wealthy during the summer months, despite these do not lead to much significance since they do so without committing a truly grave criminal-offense. With the condition that this will be their last burglary, because of the economic magnitudes that this entails, the burglars break into the desolate dwelling of a military veteran in Detroit - known only as the Blind Man -, a city that has been affected by social and economic turmoils, the perfect ghost town to run a robbery. After they are inside the house, a storm of unexpected events occur uncontrollably, proving that in the land of dark, the blind man is king.<br/><br/>With a script conceived by Fede Alvarez and his recurring collaborator Rodo Sayagues, the film deliberately slips away between personal boundaries of each character to gradually reveal who are the real preys. The narrative standards of this duo do not have moderation, nor imaginative standstills because they leverage each minor opportunity for disturb with professionalism and natural exertion. The curiosity by seeing the final result of a premise so simple and nothing muddled perverted my mind, and indeed, this is a genuine work of the suspense and horror. As a fan of the genre, it is a categorical conviction to see the unforeseen resurgence of original ideas to temporarily revitalize the harassed and wasted world of horror, though, there is no doubt that both the simplicity and efficacy of ""Don't Breathe"" will cynically be emulated in future films.<br/><br/>The continuous use of space is vital energy to join us with the setting of the story. Just as its argumentative aspect, the film insinuates us the idea of having a limited geography about the house, nonetheless, Alvarez and his team find ways to make the viewers aware of the claustrophobic impasses inside the abode. From the beginning, the camera movement makes specific focuses to key places or elements for the plot - as we will see later -, in order to situate ourselves in the sinister and colorless environment of the basement, lounge, closet or air ducts.<br/><br/>For the stifling and oppressive atmosphere were indispensable two fundaments with excellent finishes. Roque Baños is the Spanish author responsible for the tense soundtrack that accompanies the second primordial characteristic, photography. Pedro Luque - also Uruguayan - prettifies masterfully the spaces of the setting with components well measured such as lighting, brightness enhancement, suffocating camera angles and limited special effects. As you will surely remember, the chase scene in the pale dark, something in neo- noir style, without a doubt, one of the most awesome of the year since in the land of the dark, the blind man reigns and now each human being with its five senses will be more prone than the trained blind man.<br/><br/>""Don't Breathe"" takes control of each visual and narrative help at its disposal, it does not worry about to please critical spectators because it unintentionally does. The best original film of the year runs an intriguing narrative, a great-looking survival structure, tremendous innovations for the horror genre that will keep you glued to the screen and the constant improvement of a new combination of film genres (""Green Room"" & ""10 Cloverfield Lane""). Relentless, unique, simple and concise, terrifying, impressive, allegorical, gloomy, intimidating, suffocating. Fede Alvarez owed us a perfect cinematic experience after ""Evil Dead"", ""Don't Breathe"" is it, pure film."

I'm in awe of it.<br/><br/>It is so, so engaging that you unintentionally find yourself practising calm breathing sitting in the hall!<br/><br/>Given the reviews, I'd gone in with a lot of expectations from this one, hardly minutes into it the dog scene gives you an early indication of what you're in for, and trust me it keeps getting better and better. Despite its very, very short length, the suspense is so draining that you get the feeling as if you've been in for three hours!<br/><br/>I haven't watched too many better thrilling films than this, and from the ones released this year, I'd rate this one as the best alongside 'The Conjuring 2' and 'The Revenant' (which was actually released this year in Germany). Really tough to pick the best one from these, but are surely miles ahead of the others that I've watched at least.<br/><br/>Although everyone acted really well and did full justice to their respective roles, but Stephen Lang's facial expression alone during the hunting alone is worthy of being written about for pages. It's all easy to pull of a blind's man roles with black glasses put on, it is another to actually roam around in a way that really makes you look like being someone whose eyes don't function normally, if you get what I mean.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the ""twist"" in the story!

Starring Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto as three thieving teenagers who set their sights on robbing a blind man in a secluded neighborhood who supposedly sits on a massive sum from a settlement. Desperation leads people to some sinister places, and the desperation of each character was explored in Alvarez's Don't Breathe.<br/><br/>Three teenagers in depression sacked Michigan have turned to robbery as a means of survival. For Rocky (Jane Levy) there is another agenda to her criminal deeds. She has clearly lived a rough life with her addiction ridden abusive mother and can't stand to see her sister live the same life she lived, Rocky just wants to steal enough to be able to afford to take them away and start a new life. Alex (Dylan Minnette) is the brains of the operation; his father's work as a security guard affords him access to the master keys that disarm those homes and grant the teens access to steal. Money (Daniel Zovatto) is the muscle, finding out what homes to rob and selling the goods they steal for cash after each break-in. When Money hears that there is a man in a secluded, run-down neighborhood sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars he won in a settlement with a wealthy family whose young daughter killed his own daughter after striking her with a vehicle, the take is too good to refuse. Once they find out the man is blind, however, Alex has a change of heart and a resurgence of morals at the prospect of stealing from a handicapped person. Money and Rocky conversely start to think that the robbery will be all the easier and are invigorated thinking about the riches they are sure to achieve. Once they gain entry, however, things take a turn for the worse quickly, and the teens realize they are vastly in over their head and will be lucky to get out with their lives, let alone the money. <br/><br/>Don't Breathe isn't without its good moments, unfortunately, those are just moments. Daniel Zovatto really chews the scenery, and his over-exaggerated facial expressions are extremely distracting. The score is one of pure laziness. I subscribe to the notion that a horror movie is dependent upon its score. What is a good horror movie without a blood pressure raising tone to it; certainly Jaws nor Halloween would be as revered to the genre if it weren't for their classic fear-inducing music. Don't Breathe just doesn't have it, I'm not sure what the composer was going for but it didn't work. All the elements were there but it didn't amount in the end. The third act was a sharp departure from the first two and was a complete mess that didn't fit in with the preceding elements in the least. What Don't Breathe did do well was create the downtrodden, desperate atmosphere that the American town hit hardest by the economic depression of 2008 has had to deal with ever since. The audience can really appreciate the lowly state of all the kids involved that has brought them to stealing as a means of survival. I was hoping for so much more from Don't Breathe, but it falls flat, like most modern-day horror movies leaving one to wonder, is there any hope for the genre in a post-slasher film horror world?"
"parleon-thedon","8","3","10","27 August 2016"," Don't Breathe - Review: Refreshing but Lacking
","Fede Alvarez (director of the Evil Dead remake) is back with a new horror movie called Don't Breathe. I for one didn't like Fede Alvarez's remake of the Evil Dead. I thought the Evil Dead remake was fantastic from a technical aspect, however, the movies overall execution was seriously lacking.<br/><br/>First off, Don't Breathe has an interesting premise, three kids attempt to rob a blind man, but the blind man is not as helpless as they think.<br/><br/>I thought the premise of this movie was truly refreshing, I'm sick of seeing movies about ghost and demons, and so I was glad that this one strayed away from that and told something basic.<br/><br/>The directing is pretty stylish, the camera moves swiftly, and it's filled with nice tracking shots.<br/><br/>Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto all deliver a believable performance. Stephen Lang plays the blind character, his performance is memorable and convincing because it requires more demand.<br/><br/>Just like in the Evil Dead remake, all of the technical aspects are fine, but the movies overall execution is lacking.<br/><br/>I didn't care about any of the characters well-being, except for the blind man. The characters presented here gave me absolutely no reason to care about them or their outcomes. I sympathized with the blind man because of his overall situations, but I didn't care about the kids because there was no reason to. The movie didn't explain what the three main characters overall situations were, it doesn't have to, but I thought it would've at least made sense to provide the audience with minor information.<br/><br/>The suspense presented in the movie is top-notch. I was on the edge of my seat as the movie progressed. There's not much that happens here as far as death scenes are concerned, but what is present is a whole lot of suspense.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this movie, for the most part, it's a suspenseful piece of work, but it lacks in character development. Don't Breathe is an extremely refreshing horror movie, it's properly executed, but it lacks in character substance.<br/><br/>Final Grade: B"
"septimustheth","3","3","11","4 September 2016"," A film with some shining aspects that ultimately let's me down in monumental ways.
","There are some amazing things in Don't Breathe. The performances of all four of the main characters pass as real and are generally strong with only a few blemishes that, at least for me, didn't end up affecting my overall opinion of the movie. You have likely already noticed the extremely scathing review I have given the movie so I will quickly address what I really liked about the movie. <br/><br/>First, it's a return to a classic monster movie in many ways - the villain, or monster, is something that doesn't have morals attached at least in a conceptual sense. The villain is seen as more of a puzzle to be solved - the tension is built in the fact that the characters don't know how to approach the monster, making the blind man in don't breathe act like the Xenomorph in Alien or the Alien in The Thing, rather than Jigsaw in Saw. Having this being a human, and having his motivation being to simply protect what is his is really interesting.<br/><br/>There were also some really cool moments in terms of the actually imagery used. These moments are spread throughout and without spoiling anything, I won't delve into much specific detail. But those moments do exist and to be honest make up almost entirely the three stars I allotted this movie.<br/><br/>However, this movie, at least from how I saw it, is filled with flaws that almost seem too avoidable to be simply looked over. There were two glaring problems I had. First takes place very early on, right after the robbers enter the house. There is a long camera shot, that while impressive in its execution, is used to highlight various items around the house, giving the viewer a chance to piece together the potential utilization of said items before they even come into play.In a movie such as this, tension lies in the lack of information, the viewer, while they can make educated guesses, really only should know as much as the characters, but when you distinctly point out each item in the house, you're making the viewer have more information than the characters, subsequently killing tension.<br/><br/>The other flaw that annoyed me was the use of soundtrack. For a movie that creates tension through sound, there were too many moments where the soundtrack - that sounded uninspired and unoriginal - drowned out the tension that was being built by simply the presence noise or the lack thereof. There have been enough films before this one that thrived under the lack of a true soundtrack, while it is not in the same genre, No Country For Old Men is a great example. <br/><br/>These two aspects, along with another aspect that is so riddled with spoilers I dare not even tread into its waters, ultimately made me almost leave the theater. <br/><br/>My expectations were already set low for this movie, based on the Evil Dead remake, as well as the rehash of some horror tropes evident in the trailer. The concept itself is what made me give the movie a chance and it ended up letting me down completely. My suggestion to a potential viewer: watch either The Thing (1982) or 2016's Green Room for a much more thrilling and rewarding experience."

"midas-jacobs","8","2","6","28 March 2017"," A good premise, which was well executed
","Three teenagers break into the house of an old blind man, which they believe will be a simple task. Turns out it's not when the old blind man is played by Stephen Lang<br/><br/>The director is the same one who tried to remake ""Evil Dead"", which he did just OK-ly. In this film however Fede Alvarez, the director, did a fantastic job. He was the best part of the whole film. He used some very good camera movements and long takes, which created a slow feel at times, to create a tenser atmosphere. There's a very good scene when the three main protagonists first enter the house of the blind man. This was made to look like a long continuous take, in which the camera moves through the floor and through walls. In that sequence we also get to see some things that will be used further on in the film. They accentuate the things that later will be used pretty hard, but I didn't really mind because of the awesomeness of that scene alone. Fede Alvarez was really good at creating tension. He used slow editing, mixed with camera movements that went slow, or fast when needed. To build up tension, the editing was slow, and the camera movements to were slow. When there was a chase scene, it was the exact opposite. The amazing score accompanied with these scenes also helped with creating the tense atmosphere that they are going for. But the thing that might help the most is the basic premise of the film. The man having the disadvantage to the kids with being blind, and them breaking into his house, but more on that later. The cinematography was really good, this was one of the better looking horror films of recent years, some others conclude ""It Follows"" and I found ""Green Room"" to be shot very good as well. <br/><br/>The acting was just OK overall. The main actress wasn't fantastic, but she did what she did what the film asked of her. Jane Levy played this character. The kid from ""Goosebumps"", Dylan Minnette (Alex in the film) was pretty good. At least better than his co-star Jane Levy. The third and final kid of the three that break in was played by Daniel Zovatto, who basically copied Jared Leto's performance from ""Panic Room"". Not only did he copy his performance, but also his looks (the hair/clothing style). ""Don't breathe"" copies that film in numerous aspects and it's quite obvious that it wants to pay homage to it, but at times they could've kept it more subtle. The scene which I previously talked about (the one continuous take), was also sort of copied from ""Panic Room"". The final actor I want to talk about is also basically the only actor who's there to talk about, who's also the star of the film, namely Stephen Lang, who played the blind man. He was fantastic. I loved his performance. He was menacing, yet made it in the beginning look like he was very innocent. The depth that he brought to his character was really good. And also note that he barely has any lines, so it was really amazing how he was able to express his emotions via little to no dialogue, which only makes the role harder.<br/><br/>The screenplay was OK; the dialogue and premise were good, but the plot conveniences weren't really that good. These convenience or illogicalities really brought me out of the film at times. The inconsistency of the blind man's senses is an example of plot conveniences. He could smell shoes that were on the other side of the room, but wasn't able to smell someone, who's probably sweating due to stress, standing next to me. But also some things that happen mainly because of plot. Like the dog magically appearing in the house, yet all doors were locked. Or when Goosebumps kid falls through a window, yet they're all covered with bars The film contains a lot of these instances to which I disturbed myself, but these flaws aren't really groundbreaking. They are bad parts of the film and affect the grade that I'm giving this film, but overall worse things could've happened, and the good parts certainly outweigh the bad parts. Like the main premise for example. It was an original idea that hasn't really been done before, except for last year's ""Hush"", but I that film the one whose house gets broken into was deaf and not blind. This sets up an interesting story, which was also executed pretty well. And what I also liked from the film is that it plays with who you are rooting for. At first I wasn't rooting for the three leads at all, because, well, they're breaking into the house of a defenseless, old, blind man. Even when we learn that the man isn't as defenseless as he seemed in the beginning, I still rooted for him, but then at around 75 percent into the film, something happens whereby the rooting side changed, and I really liked that.<br/><br/>In the end ""Don't Breathe"" was a well shot and directed film, with an interesting premise that was well executed. It does suffer a bit of plot conveniences, but these are outweighed by the better aspects of the film. That's why this one gets an 8.1/10."
"artmania90","8","2","6","1 February 2017"," Has one of the all-time great horror movie scenes
","It's rare for a movie to have me on the edge of my seat, genuinely curious as to what will happen next. In a genre where clichés are now the running gag, to make a film that is full of original ideas and creativity is a relief to say the least. I had heard a lot about ""Don't Breathe"" mainly through word of mouth, so I decided to finally see it without having so much as read a brief synopsis. I was skeptical about how a movie like this could sustain itself for a feature runtime. I was pleasantly surprised by how effective it is.<br/><br/>The movie borrows major ideas and elements from some of cinema's best thrillers, and I mostly recalled ""Panic Room"" and ""Wait Until Dark"" as antithesis versions. The plot is almost laughably simple: 3 small-time burglars are hoping to strike it big when they hear a retired war veteran has won a settlement over the death of his daughter for upwards of $300 million. They assume the cash might be in his house, and even better is that they realize he has gone blind. These are barely kids in their 20's. Alex (the logical one of the group) uses his dad's spare keys from his security companies to disarm these homes, quietly loot various goods, and rearm the home and stage a fake robbery. Money, the wild one, is head-to-toe tattoos and carries a gun even though this could lead to a longer jail sentence should they be caught. Rocky, the heroine, sees the money as an opportunity to relocate her and her daughter to a better life. The plan is so simple.<br/><br/>The director, Fede Alvarez, is known for making ""Evil Dead"" in 2003, but this is a clear exercise in tone and suspense. With each new moment, he adds a new layer to the dread, and the camera floats through the house to remind us where spare guns are hiding, which windows have bars... It's a technique that someone like Alfred Hitchcock might appreciate: showing the audience more than the characters know. When they first enter the man's home, there is a steady shot of a hammer hanging on a rack of tools. Nothing becomes of it, but our minds begin racing with ideas of how this will come into play or what it might be used for. Later, we see a spare gun strapped to the underside of a bed. Only the audience knows what dangers are in store.<br/><br/>I won't spoil too much more of the film, only to say that the robbers' tour of the home lead to nearly every room of the home and some in between. A dark discovery in the basement finds them trapped with the blind man amongst rows and rows of shelving units, and as casually as he begins hunting them, he turns the fuse box over and leaves them in utter darkness. This scene (about midway through the film) harkened back to the chilling climax of ""Silence of the Lambs"" and yet raises the stakes tenfold from what Clarice Starling encountered with Buffalo Bill. We know his basement can only be so big, and we see the man wandering through the darkness touching familiar landmarks to remind himself the path he needs to take. Both Alex and Rocky are blind, shaking, barely moving forward. The scene is photographed in a smoky black & white, and the quiet breathes of the victims move in and out of earshot. Rocky moves down a hall, at the end of which slowly materializes the blind man, quietly waiting.. Listening. It's without a doubt one of the most effective horror scenes I have ever seen and the crowning achievement of the film.<br/><br/>The film finally sees it's own form of climax, and for me this is where it began to drag. From the old man's dog (a vicious Rottweiler with an apparent taste for human flesh) to chases back and forth inside and outside the home, I have to admit the finale of the movie became an exhausting chore to keep up with. There were many moments when it felt like the story was coming to an end, and the 'shocking' moments were realizing that it was still going. This movie requires a great suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy (the logics of this movie have to be taken with a grain of salt or I would guess one's appreciation might be somewhat lessened), and with each new ""twist"" I felt the movie losing it's claustrophobic feel and moving more towards a standard slasher flick with it's own set of rules and horror clichés.<br/><br/>Regardless, I will honestly admit this was a very fun film to experience in a theater. The photography is closed in and haunting, and the performance by Stephen Lang as the blind man is sure to become a classic in the vaults of iconic horror villains. For a movie with such a simple idea as a robbery gone wrong, boy did they get it so right. I only wish they would have pushed it further instead of drifting back to the standards a typical Hollywood revenge flick might take."
"grantbell-85547","9","2","6","28 January 2017"," This movie was great!!!
","I loved this movie! It is full of suspense and thrills! Every character could be categorized as a 'baddie', which means when the carnage begins there is no reason to feel sorry for anyone! This film was made for about $10 million according to the web. It was a simple plot designed to give the audience some good scares and thrills. IT DELIVERED! I must say if you demand an Alfred Hitchcock or Steven Spielberg type experience out of every movie you see, then you should really get some perspective on reality! I am fed up with all the negative reviews from the haters! Why is the internet culture a culture of negativity and ridicule? The film, Don't Breathe, is a fun experience with every bit of suspense and tension that a movie of this genre can be expected to deliver. The reviewers who analyzed this movie down to the finest details act like they are so divine and insightful with their criticisms. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a simple thriller for a fun time. Go watch Meryl Streep if you want a Best Picture nomination experience! BOO HATERS."
"bryank-04844","7","2","6","23 January 2017"," Horror has a new name with 'Don't Breathe'.
","Fede Alvarez burst onto the scene a few years ago with his short film on YouTube called 'Ataque de Pánico!' It was so well received and well done that a few weeks later, Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and Rob Tapert were calling him non-stop and even offered the Uruguayan filmmaker the chance to direct the remake of 'The Evil Dead', which came out 2013 to rave reviews and fan appreciation for what it was. Since then, Fede has a few projects in the works coming up, as he is one of the top new filmmakers to watch in the horror genre.<br/><br/>His newest film, 'Don't Breathe' is almost the complete opposite of 'his remake of the 'Evil Dead', in that it is shows almost zero gore and blood and relies on a high amount of suspense and tension throughout the film, which is indeed very successful. I was definitely fidgeting with my fingers and on the edge of my seat the entire time, as the movie goes through dark halls and corners both visually and metaphorically with some sinister twists and turns throughout. The added suspense comes with making the unnamed old man in the film blind, as three young adults plan to rob him, not really knowing who or what he is.<br/><br/>Even the multiple locks on the doors and bars on the windows in his run-down Detroit home are not enough clues to these kids that maybe this house is not a good idea. The young adults Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto are on a house robbing spree, in order to make enough money to get out of Detroit. It's a half-baked notion and story, but it gets us into the house owned by a blind man (Stephen Lang) with a past. The problem here is that each character and most of the dialogue just doesn't make any sense and comes across as silly to where you just roll your eyes. It takes you out of the whole suspense here and there during the film.<br/><br/>The reasons why these kids rob houses isn't entirely clear and they don't come across as being in anyway redeeming, compared with the crimes they commit. The dialogue is also borderline cringe worthy, and when Stephen Lang finally talks, he sounds a lot like Batman's nemesis Bane, which caused laughter, rather than horror. That all being said, Fede Alvarez is a master of his camera and shooting a movie. From the steadicam one shot that moves multiple levels through the house as the robbers case the place to the slow and intensifying shots in the more suspenseful moments all work very well. The camera purposefully lets you know what props and other devices will come into play later in the film, which already gets your mind going.<br/><br/>Alvarez also uses a different version of night vision here when the lights go out in the basement of his home, which is utterly terrifying, and I hope that gets used in future films. Jane Levy is an excellent actress and coming from her starring role in 'Evil Dead', she has more or less to work with here, but she gives it her all and is the one character who actually has some sort of backstory. The other two actors, who again are good, just have no where to go here, thus not connecting or really care what happens to them.<br/><br/>And of course there is Stephen Lang, who besides his accent in the film, is one of the scariest characters of recent memory, who takes some dark turns throughout, but also has his own reasoning, which is in away – sympathetic. Oh yeah, and he's blind. The score by Roque Baños has a John Carpenter aspect to it at times and always adds to the high tension throughout. I just wish the story and the bulk of the characters weren't as silly as they came across here. Still, this is a solid and effective effort from Fede Alvarez.<br/><br/>WORTH A LOOK!"
"Laakbaar","8","2","6","18 January 2017"," Good drama
","This is actually a pretty good movie. I recommend it if you're looking for something to watch. The basic plot is this: millennials break into a old blind guy's house to rob him, but end up fighting for their lives.<br/><br/>This film has an unusual twist to it: the protagonists are the bad guys. Throughout the movie we are challenged with good and bad aspects of the two sides. There is some interesting moral ambiguity here. Who are we rooting for exactly? <br/><br/>On the one hand, we have attractive millennials, possessing youth and sight, but living amorally and narcissistically. On the other hand, we have a blind old man who has lived a life of discipline and service, and is still a force to be reckoned with despite his age and blindness; however, he is creepy as hell, vengeful, and capable of using violence to defend himself. And he has a very mean dog.<br/><br/>I'm not sure everyone would enjoy this kind of moral ambiguity.<br/><br/>The most important character in this movie is the house. This is where the characters fight each other for their lives. Much of the tension of the movie comes from the fact that he knows his house, and the intruders don't.<br/><br/>The film is worth about 7.5, but I'm going to round it up because it was just entertaining."
"runamokprods","7","2","6","28 December 2016"," Well made, intense and effective, but missed the chance to go deeper
","Tense and effective thriller that, interestingly, has more of a horror movie feel, although there is nothing supernatural about the tale. In Detroit, a team of three young people burglarize rich people's houses, It's made possible by Alex, the brains, whose dad works for an alarm company, giving him access to keys and codes. Money is the muscle, a street guy who gets off on the rush of the whole thing as much as the pay-offs, and the girl at the center is Rocky, dreaming of a score big enough to escape from her trailer park existence (and crazy mother) with her toddler kid sister. <br/><br/>The three hear about what should be an easy target. A blind gulf war veteran living alone in an abandoned part of town, who supposedly keeps a $300K cash settlement from his daughter's accidental death in his house. (Stephen Lang is very effective as the blind man). Of course, nothing IS easy, or there would be no film. The movie creates terrific suspense without having to rely to heavily on gore or easy 'cat-suddenly- jumping-out-of-closet' scares. This has echoes of John Carpenter's 'Assault on Precinct 13' and even 'Alien' in it's intelligent use of a strong, claustrophobic main location and interesting character details to produce it's fun-house ride. There are also a couple of very effective visual twists I don't remember seeing before. <br/><br/>On the other hand, while it's a very impressive ride, it's also a limited one. The few deeper themes touched on tend to the broad and obvious. And the film doesn't linger on them much. Which is too bad, since the 'heroes' of the story are three punk kids robbing a blind veteran – who arguably has every right to defend himself. In turn, that would seem fertile territory to raise an interesting 'who's the real villain and why' examination that never comes. Indeed, the moral issues are aggressively avoided by the script turning characters far too neatly into monsters or 'good under it all' archetypes. <br/><br/>A well made, effective enjoyable film, that had a shot of being something even more."
"kweaser","4","2","6","10 December 2016"," Intense, Yet Poor Messages to the Viewer
","""Don't Breathe"" is meant to be an intense thriller. I wouldn't classify it as a horror film. This piece posed some interesting plot spins and unexpected plot twists for sure. However, the miscalculation lies greatly for me in the lack of a wholesome message from the get go, and a lack of character development. From the beginning you see 3 young adults breaking and entering a home to retrieve valuables. Two of the characters strictly retrieve valuables, while the other does unnecessary additional damage including urinating on the the kitchen floor. There is not a clear reason for their burglary. A few more minutes in we see that two of the characters have unfortunate situations, yet the justification for breaking and entering must be seen as invalid. As the burglars looks to move on to their next steal, a lack of remorse is put on situation and is simply justified by the characters themselves as being an act against the rich and greedy, not as a crime for selfish gain. While the demographic of the homeowners may be as such, it does not justify the injustice. When the characters move to the forefront of the remainder of the story, they intend to rob from a blind man in an uninhabited neighborhood. The blind man has his own unfortunate story of the death of his daughter and his own disability. The young adults justify this steal with the idea that this man is also wealthy and has his own dark side. The robbery begins and seems to have poor execution in a sense of sound. For a burglary, and a burglary being done in the home of a man who is blind but with advanced sense of hearing, things are done rather poorly which doesn't speak much sense to the story. A series of small events occur, including one of the characters abandoning the mission, but what is unexpected to the characters but obvious to the viewer, is that they will be discovered by the homeowner who has his own destructive, criminal past. <br/><br/>This movie puts the viewer in a spot to decide who's side is more worth being on, or who is more worthy of life. This is impossible because both are guilty and while the homeowner's discovered crime is punishable by law with more intensity,the behavior of neither party is acceptable. What makes this even more unfortunate, is that their isn't any redemption or conviction on either side, and justice is not served on either side. This is where the message of the movie is distasteful at best. I fear that we are at a place where we no longer long for justice, and if one is not careful, it is very easy to fall in the trap as the viewer to walk out of the film with the idea that the burglars'behavior is justifiable given their disadvantaged circumstances and that because of the blind man's own disgraceful crimes, that somehow the last burglar has a right to the money she walks away with. Besides the moral conflict in the story, there isn't any significant character development or moral of the story. So thematically, the movie also fails in its artistic presentation. It is not clear to the viewer what the takeaway or message is of the artists at work. If the piece was even just to be for sheer entertainment, there are sparks of surprise and suspense, but without those other important pieces like character development, plot significance, etc. it still falls very short of being an engaging, impressive work."

","I checked the spoiler box but honestly a movie that starts out showing you the ending is hard to spoil. How they get there is usually the interesting part but this one just made me yell at it for the duration.<br/><br/>My biggest pet peeve in any movie is characters that are unbelievably dumb just to keep the plot moving along. The premise of the movie is a battle between a sightless but well skilled combat vet and a small crew of hooligans (well in sight but not so much in battle). The problem is the kids greatest strength is to stay quiet.. AKA ""Don't Breathe"" yet they spend the entire moving failing to Shut The F%^& Up! It's not *that hard to stay quiet yet minute after minute of this movie they can't manage to pull that off in the slightest. I'm sorry but, burnouts they may be, they are smarter than that and the movie fails work with that in a believable way.<br/><br/>Honestly acting was decent. The film was shot well and looked fine. My entire beef is with the script. Boo."

","In my opinion, Don't Breath was the best movie of the summer. I went and seen it with some friends and at the end I wanted to replay the movie. When I first seen the preview, I thought I was going to be scary. Turns out it's really not. Most of the parts in the movie that made the audience scream and jump were just unexpected things that popped onto the screen quickly. I was impressed with the story line. I had never heard of a movie even remotely similar and it took a lot of creativity to create the story line they did. <br/><br/>Some things that I didn't really like where the killing of the character ""Alex"" and the ending. The death of Alex was sad and made the entire movie theater upset. He was a good kid that was drawn to the wrong crowd by love. He went out defending the one he loved so I guess that was a plus. At the end of the movie, the man ends up surviving and the director sets the scenes up to let viewers believe there could be a sequel. The movie was already, there's no need to drag it on with a whole new movie. <br/><br/>Some significant cinematography include but are not limited to: no-diegetic music, long Dutch angles and short clips that keep the viewers glued. In one scene, I enjoyed the actor's style. the blind man was trying to find the kids in the dark. I think its cool that the director threw this in there.( he evened the playing field)the look and expressions on the actors faces are priceless and could was interesting to see. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this movie. I would pay to watch it again. I don't feel the need to mention specifics but the director had very effective ways of making sure his film was remembered. go check it out !!!"

","***contains BIG spoiler*** I like the movie but it got some flaws which dragged Don't Breathe down for me - how difficult can it be to maneuver and knock out a blind guy!? For one million dollar I would dare my life at stake and show it on a live show how it's done - fast and easy (ninjas ofc excluded). At least down in the basement it would be an easy task (lots of tools for weapons and hiding spots etc.) - to the movie makers: if the blind guy shoots a gun down in the basement he would loose inevitable at least temporarily his only sense to spot the intruders - his ears would be deafened, gunfire makes some certain noises I think and especially in a small surrounding with walls around, well, I leave the conclusion to you guys... Back to the movie: one of the major traps many horror movies fall in is the dumbness of the protagonists which take out a lot of the fun (at least for me) - if it's not intended like in a horror-comedy. I remember watching a movie called Shuttle where a group of young boys and girls get kidnapped (the girls should be sold as sex-slaves or sth like that). One of the girls had at least 3 times the chance to kill the kidnapper/slave-trader - as the girl was in the end sold and departed to her cruel destiny I just thought: well, you kinda deserved it honey. So if you don't mind to watch some VERY incapable dudes getting hunted by a blind guy you get a good cast, production value etc. and a lot of suspense (not much nonsense in this movie, it hits right to the point of the movie). With less dumb acting characters I would have rated the movie 7 or even 8 (if you are able to put out your why-they-just-don't-do-this-or-try-that-button off in your head), cuz I couldn't put off the button to ignore the mostly stupid actions of our heroes the brain-lobotomized-dumbness-factor dragged the movie down to a 6 for me. Btw - one way to get the blind man confused would have been to put every single radio and machine in the house on, or get some tools in your hand and just throw it into another corner or another room if he comes near you etc. pp. - why playing the old mans game in trying to be silent and outwit his sharpened hearing-sense ;) Also the end - the kitty-room in the basement, all the DNA and stuff (a girl disappears and no cop dropped by to the blind man's house to check just in case, you know, cuz the very girl was involved in some accident killing this very man's daughter!?) and the blind guy gets away with it!? No way (but it's a horror movie, so you need a twist at the end lalala). Imo a very dumb end on top and so the final verdict: this movie plays not in the ivory league of horror shows. And to the movie makers - don't you dare to make a sequel where the blind guy is hunting our surviving girl in some dark woods or in New York!"
"macarenalopezaraya","6","2","6","6 October 2016"," How to ruin an otherwise great storyline with plot holes and silly mistakes
","Well, first of all, I have to say that I do tend to be particularly critical when it comes to movies. It simply happens. However, that also means that I can justify my disappointment towards this particular movie. Heads up, my review will contain some spoilers and, since I am not a native speaker, some grammar mistakes. <br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I did find some great things in Don't Breath. Cast being one of them. Stephen Lang's character is someone who could have been taken from a nightmare. His interpretation was believable as an utterly unstable man. Jane Levy shone in her part as well, making Rocky a quite relatable young woman.Now, here we start with the problems. Dylan Minnette actually did a good job in the movie, but I think that his character was actually undeveloped; why was he robbing houses without caring much about how his father could be implicated? And Daniel Zovatto...well, I don't understand why they had to include such a stereotypical character. <br/><br/>Now, moving on to major problems. Even with the storyline being particularly inventive, specially with the twist we get at the end, I noticed way too many mistakes in the plot and...in overall logic and common sense. Here come the SPOILERS, do not read unless you want to.<br/><br/>From the beginning, the robbers try to be silent at times but when they speak, they have no problem with practically shouting all over the place. Later on, when the blind man appears, he cannot hear that there are two other robbers in the house, even with them inches away from him. But he immediately develops an ultra sensitive hearing sense that feels more like a superpower than the ability a blind man would develop to overcompensate his sight. By the end of the movie, this man even appears to be wounded by the sound of the alarm going off. I get that he would feel disoriented and annoyed by the noise, but his reaction was unbelievable.<br/><br/>Also unbelievable is this man's dog. For Crist's sake, he was Cujo! Not only was he utterly violent, which I understand if he was trained, but he was like a tracking machine. I mean, at the end of the movie he chased the girl to the car, without any indications whatsoever, he discovered her, waited outside the car, found an open window and tried to climb through it...and then found the trunk of the car open and got in there to then break out of the sits. It was just too much. And the fact that they used a ""violent"" breed does not justify his over the top behavior. <br/><br/>Now, there is one mistake that I simply could not overlook and that made me almost laugh in the theater. When Rocky and Alex are trapped in the upstairs room and they are unable to escape they clearly say AND show that the windows have bars. Then how the hell does Alex passes through the window, seconds later, when the dog attacks him? Seriously? HOW could they not see that when they were editing the movie? <br/><br/>Finally, the girl trapped in the house was actually a good twist. The idea of what he wanted to do with her. But...how come she had a newspaper article about herself down there? It was obviously to simplify the discovery when Rocky and Alex found her, but it was a very unlikely situation. And at the end of the movie....is it really possible that the police simply decided to overlook the pillow- prison at the house? And the chains, and the instruments he used for insemination? I find that very doubtful. <br/><br/>The movie does have its merit, however. The use of camera was actually quite distinctive. When the characters first enter the house, there is a FANTASTIC sequence shot that shows the house and characters. And I really appreciated the lightning used during the ""lights out"" chasing at the basement. The green light most movies use would have ruined the suspense for me. <br/><br/>All things considered, I would not say ""don't watch the movie"", but do not go thinking you are going to see a 7.6 quality movie because that is not the case."
"hermann-43163","8","2","6","4 October 2016"," Movie review.
","The cast of Don't Breathe does not contain any superstars with exception of the forever young Stephen Lang (Avatar, Jarhead 2 and Public Enemies). Then you have 3 relatively young and fresh actor's in Jane Levy (Rocky), Dylan Minnette (Alex) and Daniel Zovatto (Money). So considering all the rookie actors and one medium well known man the movie has not been expected to hit the billboard for movies in 2016. A group of 3 young criminals have discovered a house that could be their very last robbery that would send them off to sunny California. The only thing that stand between the young bunch and the Golden State is a blind Navy Seal veteran. How hard can it be to steal money from a blind man?<br/><br/>Rocky is a bad girl, but one can easily sympathize with her because of her abusive mother and family background. She is smart and is dreaming to escape far away from the shantytown Detroit have become. Then there is Alex, an expert on disarming alarms and being the careful kid in the bunch. Last person is Money. He is the aggressive douchebag with a ""Fuck you"" attitude. They all have their differences, but this makes them also fit together because they all have their expertise in their area of crime. Fede Alvarez, the director of the movie has set up a very typical gang and going with the typical gang<br/><br/>You quickly see that Don't Breathe is not your typical horror movie. How can a robbery of a blind man be scary? That is where Fede Alvarez have done a good job with the plot and the cinematography. The war veteran ends up being a very capable man having sharp senses and does not seem affected at all being completely blind. What makes this movie so scary is how the cinematography is set up. During the robbery which takes place in the middle of the night the cameras is close up on the actors giving us a scary night vision and the scared expression of the kids and also the anger showed by the blind war veteran. There are also scenes that makes you jump because the blind man suddenly comes up from nowhere and the way Alvarez have directed it, it makes us feel like we are the teenagers in the dark. <br/><br/>The fact that the movie is 1 hour and 28 minutes makes it a ""short"" and intense movie. When you look at the plot itself it seems like your regular scary movie and expecting all the kids to die. But Alvarez has created a very well-round horror movie that makes the audience jump, it makes the audience feel like they are in the house and makes the audience feel that all they want to do is simply get the hell out of there. And if you have seen some horror movies before you know that there is always a big secret that affects your whole perspective. Fede Alvarez created a big dark secret that makes you question ethics and morals of what actions a sane person could do. So you wonder how hard it could be to steal from a blind man? Then I suggest you go to see Don't Breathe."
"magickonarski","6","2","6","23 September 2016"," First half was good
","This movie definitely did not lack originality and was a fresh addition to the thriller genre. <br/><br/>Given that it is listed as a horror movie, the first jump scare made everyone in the cinema jump simultaneously (literally) but it felt like lack of a lot more jump scares given the potential was disappointing. <br/><br/>The viewer is ultimately left to decide whose side he is on as both the thieves and the blind man show their good and bad sides - again, very original.<br/><br/>There were some serious factual errors with blindness in this movie, but I did not notice them until I have read an analysis later.<br/><br/>There wasn't a moment without action in this movie which was interesting but seemed to overuse it just a bit too much.<br/><br/>Generally, the first half of this movie was VERY interesting and thrilling. As the movie continued, one particular scene seemed completely unnecessary and forced, and the action that followed seemed pushed and repetitive to what already happened.The plot's time span seemed to make the movie slightly boring as I was expecting more.<br/><br/>If you even slightly enjoyed 'Hush (2016)' you will enjoy this movie."

","this was my blind date movie at theater i got free ticket to see movie, and i really loved it writing is so good it's 80's john carpenter style similar movie to It Follows (2014)but it's not supernatural thing, it's like less thriller but more of horror movie not because of jump scenes. i would say it's better then Evil Dead (2013) same lead actress who toke this role Sam Raimi one of my favorite directors but i could have add john carpenter for movie for writes or directed it, would be best idea As producer for him opinion of mine but it's Sam Raimi great director Evil Dead franchise. well it's better movie then Poltergeist (2015) i like throw up on it plus Sam Produce the movie, but then this Don't Breathe is better movie. the opening is great like John Carpenter style a lot of camera movement rotating camera. title comes up don't breathe like old school style 80's traditional new age 80's idea but no 80's music like guest or it follows different style. <br/><br/>Plot:(Jane Levy)Rocky funny name for girl to name rocky not rocky balboa. She is a thief that breaks into houses and they sell the items that they steal for money with her thuggish partner(Money)Daniel Zovatto same actor who did it Follows(2014) and Alex(Dylan Minnette)they made plans to move out town but Alex can't go because he's dad want's to stay in town.

The noise wakes up the Blind Man<br/><br/>stupid thing is why didn't money character just stepped back kill blind guy but Blind man kills money so it's more of surviving in a house invasion i would say it's better then Purge. no jumps scenes at all good story writing of film a lot gore but not much, i found this movie scary keeps you watching all the time knowing what's going to happen to next good twist of film some of great mystery staff in movie. i know characters ain't good guys but they are still likable Rocky, Alex were likable characters but they ain't good people but expect for money is big ass in film as character. shocking ending of film that what you thought that was going to happen next. but doesn't end up happen amazing plot twist and there is Disgusting scene that i won't explain it's not gore but it's something that you don't wanna read hear it's going to make you sick or make you throw up in front of your computer. it's really great movie i would highly recommend"
"KristianZacc","9","2","6","20 September 2016"," Surprise Hit of 2016!
","Don't Breathe<br/><br/>Minor/Vague Spoilers<br/><br/>Last year it was The Gift, this year it's Don't Breathe. A Film that has come, seemingly, out of nowhere in the thriller/horror category and to me at least completely taken by surprise by how excellently both were done.<br/><br/>The director, Fede Alvarez, is very impressive with some of the shot compositions that he comes up with. While I wasn't a fan of his Evil Dead remake a few years ago he returns with a big hit. When the movie turned and Stephen Lang's character switches from innocent looking blind man to bad ass blind man the tone was set for the rest of the run time. 90% of this movie takes place in his house and you feel everything from isolation to fear to sometimes even catching yourself holding your breath as the kids do while Stephen Lang walks around the house hunting them down. When the kids first enter the house there is a great tracking shot that lasts quite a few minutes and never seems to cut away and it was very effective in showing the layout of the house as the kids walked inside it. <br/><br/>The film has mostly an unknown cast barring Stephen Lang who plays a blind man who owns the house that the three kids are trying to rob. He is very intimidating and because of his little dialogue it is all about his physical performance and he brings that in spades. Seeing him charge around the house as he goes after the kids with a weapon. There are some other subtle moments where you see him feeling his way around his house and tapping the ceiling, or swinging a small fan to get his bearings on his house and instantly know where he is.<br/><br/>I felt that most, if not all, of the characters choices made were realistic. As they made their decisions I would quickly think to myself if that would be the right choice and this made the film be more believable even in this odd situation. Adding to this is also the lack of false jump scares where the direction of the camera or the music is leading up to a scare and then a cat jumps out of nowhere or a hand on a shoulder. They were all real scares and this is a huge plus for me as false jump scares always frustrate me and just come off as a cheap and unnecessary. Thankfully, this film takes the opposite approach and there are, obviously, a lot of silence which creates tension and adds to the tone that I was talking about before. <br/><br/>The way the first twist was delivered felt very convenient in the way it was delivered to the audience but I don't know how else they could've done it. The big twist felt very ""icky"" and really grossed me out but that doesn't mean it was a bad thing, actually, I think it succeeded in what Alvarez was trying to do. Even if it took away from the simple premise of the movie I still think it added to Lang's character as you find out his motivations for some of the things he does. <br/><br/>The movie keeps on going as well and builds upon the previous scene. Just when you thought the movie was coming to its end another moment happens and that happens a few times. Thankfully, it doesn't feel dragged out but instead just made it more suspenseful. <br/><br/>In the end, Don't Breathe was a refreshing take on the horror film genre which wouldn't surprise me if it was in my top 10 of the year, as was The Gift. It flipped the home invasion trope on its head and the tension is always turned up to a ten. As a huge horror fan I really hope this film is successful so it can lead the horror genre outside of the conventional box it is in now."

"wheresjoeysmovie","8","2","6","12 September 2016"," Fitting title
","Not without flaws, this is a taut, tense movie. I enjoy movies with a gray area as to whom to vote for. Everyone in this film has good and bad. They all have a particular goal and they all are ruthless toward achieving it.<br/><br/>The basic premise is a blind man gets a huge settlement after his daughter is killed in a vehicular manslaughter situation. Three thieves are privy to this and want to steal his money. One of them has a father who works in security and has keys to all the security systems in the area and with information. He wants to help the girl who desperately wants out of her situation (and needs money) because he loves her. Her boyfriend is all talk about getting things done and a bit of a douche but has a heart in there too. It was also for me a bit like a millennial vs. old school. The blind man is a war vet who was blinded in the war and the thieves are millennials in that they feel entitled to someone else's stuff but there is still a gray area in this section THANKFULLY. You will see. <br/><br/>You switch off more than once about who to feel sympathetic for or whether to root for anyone. One thing for sure is you will be tense and on the edge of your seat. There are also plenty of twists here and there to keep you interested. This is better than the other horror movies you can go see right now I bet. Stephen Lang (as the blind man) does a great job. The more I think about it after, the more I like it. PS Don't watch the trailer."
"the_movie_addict","8","2","6","12 September 2016"," if you know what horror movies are then this is what you would be watching now...
","this movie was seen by me as a result of Fede Alvarez's earlier works such as evil dead where i was gripped on by the plot of this where in my case it was 'WAIT UNTIL DARK MEETS PANIC ROOM' but the director made me surprised when he didn't look for cheap thrills and clichés of horror and tension movies and went on with a real story of a person in any of the side where he/she can be caught on with such circumstances and results. this film was about celebrating horror films that have frayed hard on to be noticed and now resulting in new box office results. if tension and suspense are you looking for and horrors have been tasted by you then this is the dessert you should be licking this week."
"jamesthecat-67828","5","2","6","11 September 2016"," Well crafted, but not well written
","In an interview about 'Aliens', James Cameron stated that as he didn't have enough time to go into the backstory of all the marines, the quickest way to make an audience care about a character is to make them funny. How a little humour would've gone a long way in 'Don't Breathe'.<br/><br/>Fede Alvarez knows there's no getting around the central problem of his three protagonists - they're criminals; so he tries to elicit sympathy by portraying their home lives as less than idyllic. Well, sorry, but that just doesn't cut it. He's wasting his time trying to justify their actions, because there's no justification, so he should've at least made them lovable rogues, by having them be witty. Unfortunately, wit is something this film doesn't possess. An 'X Factor' style sob story just doesn't do the trick.<br/><br/>If you look at other teen horrors like 'A Nightmare on Elm Street','Scream', 'Final Destination', etc, they were frequently funny due to the teens remarks about the situation, which makes you warm to the characters. If you don't care, you don't scare.<br/><br/>Having said that, 'Don't Breathe'is very well directed, Alvarez has some camera moves that would make David Fincher proud. It's just a shame not as much thought was invested into making the audience care what happens."

That old man has acted good and that character is good and scary. there is this one disgusting scene but that seems necessary to make movie bit horrifying.

","As many people told already, the least you know about the movie, the more you end up enjoying it. I for one went in knowing absolutely nothing but the name, and while I'm not a big fan of the genre, I found this title to be superb. To give as few information as possible, the story begins when three amateur thieves attempt a robbery inside a house inhabited by a blind man and his lovely dog, thinking it'd be an easy target, but then things start going awfully wrong for them.<br/><br/>Truth be told, it's pleasant to see titles not going over supernatural based-on-real-facts-yet-truly-unbelievable kind of stuff (yes, I'm looking at you The Conjuring) for a change. A great film worth watching and with very few flaws."

A few more lingo from the blind wouldn't have hurt either.<br/><br/>In other words, you take Home Alone and engineer it inside out , what you get is Don't Breathe.

"connormccage","7","2","6","6 September 2016"," Although it suffers from some pitfalls along the way, Don't Breathe is another example of Fede Alvarez's talent.
","Don't Breathe is not an easy movie to watch, nor is it a pleasant one. These attributes do not hurt the movies quality or take away from Fede Alvarez's talent.<br/><br/>The director first emerged with his mainstream debut, a remake of Evil Dead, which succeeded in being different than the original and still a fantastic movie. His next step was Don't Breathe a movie that centers around three teen robbers that break into an old blind man's house as one last job before they leave the run down Detroit. This all goes horribly wrong when the Old Man is more powerful then he appears to be and a deadly game of Cat and Mouse is played.<br/><br/>Just like with Evil Dead, Fede has directed a movie that can be viewed in both ways that any Good horror movie can be viewed. An experience that scares and also encourages you to cheer on the likable characters as they dodge the deadly killer. The movie is claustrophobic and has some of the best jump scares ever seen in film. This is not a movie that relies on loud organs and screams to fright as the movie makes you feel as trapped and hurt as the main characters. <br/><br/>Now to the last twenty minutes of the movie which is sure to be water- cooler talk for the next week. The movie has one of the most tense scenes ever in a film. It is a very provocative scene and will make some uncomfortable to the point of walking out of the theater. The high octane scene also makes the climax of the movie a little weak by comparison and it goes out on a whimper instead of a bang. <br/><br/>Don't Breathe is worth a watch, even if you might have to step out of the theater for certain parts. This is a movie for fans of Green Room, Evil Dead, or any good slasher flick."
"meform","6","2","6","6 September 2016"," A ton of potential, but failed in execution.
","****This review tries to avoid specific spoilers, but does contain generic spoilers about how the plot goes**** <br/><br/>The previews for ""Don't Breathe"" made it look like the viewer was going to be taken along for a wild ride in a psychological thriller. There was certainly a ton of potential for a thrill ride, but in the end, the execution, delivery, and some choices made in creating the movie fail.<br/><br/>Instead of the thriller I expected, I got a drama with no clear protagonist to root for. In my eyes, all of the characters have flaws that make it very easy to root against them. The original antagonists are simply trying to better their situation, even if the means they choose aren't accepted by societal norms. The original protagonist is quickly revealed to have issues that make him unlikable at first, and hate-able by the end. Even the dog in the movie, in doing what dogs do, is hard to cheer for the way it is portrayed.<br/><br/>The movie itself was decent, and does have a few ""make you jump"" moments, even if they were semi-predictable. But the movie is just as likely to make you say - in polite terms - ""What did I just see?"" instead of jump. While not a gore-fest, the movie does rely on gore for the scares and jumps as opposed to mentally scaring the viewer.<br/><br/>One other issue with the movie is there clear-cut ending in terms of how to feel. This movie left me with more confusion than anything - perhaps because there isn't a clear protagonist/antagonist relationship between the characters. Without the delineation between good and bad, there is no ending that truly works.<br/><br/>When the above are added to a few obvious continuity issues within the flow of the movie, the movie, as a whole, simply falls short of its potential."
"pottie22","8","2","6","5 September 2016"," Best Horror Movie if wasn't Twisted
","This movie is great if you have a strong stomach and love a good suspenseful movie with action, and jump scares. This movie is definitely worth seeing,however turns from suspenseful,and scary to Grose, which may turn off a lot of viewers. This movie is probably one of the most suspenseful I've witnessed in the last few years, but one of the grossest as well. Bottom line if you can handle Grose and suspenseful jump scares this is the movie for you. Overall I thought Don't Breath was a great story,and intense almost all the way through. The movie starts off slow, and then slowly gets more interesting,and intense by the minute. Don't Breathe starts off with Teenagers thinking they have a good shot of Robing this blind old man, when little do they know this guy is the wrong twisted guy to mess with. Midway through the movie it seems like the old man is useless, but that isn't the case. Don't Breathe is one of the best horror movies I've saw all year, and grossest. So if you like Grose and scary go see this movie! Why is this movie so interesting? The story line, and the suspense with it. Why is this movie not in some areas? Well that's easy! It can get really unpleasant in some spots of the movie near the end. If the movie wasn't twisted I think this would hands down be the best horror movie of the year because it includes every aspect of an awesome horror movie."
"sesht","Null","2","6","4 September 2016"," True Beneficiaries
","1st things 1st. This movie, is in exalted company. <br/><br/>Wait until dark. Cape Fear. Both versions. You're Next (absolutely fantastic). Ils, and it's American remake, The Strangers. Funny Games. A ClockWork Orange. Panic Room. The Purge. Haute Tension / High Tension. The Collector. Pacific Heights. Unlawful Entry. The Raid: Redemption. Yup. Even this one.<br/><br/>1 of the things about home-invasion movies is how much more easily the audience-members can identify with the protagonist(s) whose domain is being invaded. <br/><br/>Audience loyalty(ies) is/are tested (shifted) every time, with each and every twist in the tale, including one that I honestly did not see coming, that most local audience-members could not stomach, and it IS something that will make, or break your regard for the work that the makers have put into.<br/><br/>About character affectations, a very refreshing aspect is how consistent the main leads are, like ppl are in real life, to what motivates them throughout. Overt nods are paid to those (the bag! the continuous unrequited love! the pig-headedness!), and while I value subtlety and being nuanced (in the arts) rather than being overt, in this case, I thought those particular nods were justified, especially in one of the main characters' cases. <br/><br/>1 of the best things about the movie, Avatar's very own 'Quaritch', Stephen Lang, brings, to his rendering of the not-helpless-at-all blind man (pro/antagonist?), an amazingly fluid grace in terms of body language, in each and every sequence he fills the screen with, that hearkens to memory the recent rendering of a similar character, Stick, by thespian Scott Glenn, and also Rutger Hauer's similar (and not-so-similar) act in the late 80s cult-classic, 'Blind Fury'. <br/><br/>The camera-work and the framing, along with the set and production design, plus the on-location work, in Detroit, or places that look like it, are absolutely top-notch. <br/><br/>The (DI?) color-palette also makes it seem like a movie from the 80s or the 90s, or maybe even earlier, and reminded me of David Fincher's team's work on 'Zodiac' and 'Se7en' ('Panic Room' as well). Also, 'Kill the messenger' and 'Nightcrawler'. A friend also mentioned that it did call to mind the nouveau (almost) 1- long/continuous-take movie, 'Too Late'.<br/><br/>The background score is on-target, only calling attention to itself during the B-movie/grind-house style end-credits, which are also a treat to sit thru. Sound design in this kinda movie is one of the lynch-pins the entire narrative has to be supported by, and is more than up to the task. Top-notch, once again. <br/><br/>I haven't watched Fédé Alvarez's remake of Sam Raimi's (producer on this one as well) cult-classic, 'Evil Dead', but now am curious to examine his work on that. He seems to have sound-bytes out on wanting to do more original stuff than remakes, with this being the 'original', but the way it has been filmed, this wears its influences on its sleeve, and for my money, though I think it IS good, I would never call this original. 'Room' was original. 'The Babadook' was original (tho it does not belong in this genre). 'You're Next' was original. This one, on the other hand, for all its positive attributes, is anything but original.<br/><br/>Btw, and this just a random observation I had while watching this (which did not detract from this well-made movie) - I do not understand why it has to be 3 invaders every time ('Panic Room', anyone? or 'Wait until dark', for that matter, 1 of the pioneers in this genre). Can't it be more/less?<br/><br/>It's sad that many people are spoiling the flick for ppl who've not seen it, by revealing the 2rd-act twist online. They're just leaving leftovers for the rest of the audience. Having said that, I know the 3rd act twist, and still wanna watch it again. <br/><br/>Not to be missed, especially on the big screen. Not for the squeamish, or the easily offended, either."

","Yesterday, I saw Don't Breath This film is thrilling chilling and popcorn spilling, it's a perfect blend of surreal timing and visually remarkable camera work. The film is crazy disturbed, demented, and it's proud of it, now before I begin my Review I want to let everyone know I love Horror films they are one of my favorite genre of film. Quite honestly usually I only like old school horror, Be the most modern day horror I find over budgeted super flashy and never truly chilling or terrifying. However: Don't breath is a complete breath of fresh air no pun intended to a dying genre of horror the home invasion film how do they do this read my review to find out. Let's begin my review of Don't Breathe. This film is Written by Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues and is also directed by Fede Alvarez. The Film stars Jane levy as rocky, Daniel Zovatto as Money, Dylan Minnette Alex, Stephan Lang as The Blind Man, Emma Bercovici as Diddy, Franciska Torocsik Cindy, Christian Zagia as Raul, Katia Bokor as Ginger, Sergej Onopko as Trevor, Olvia Gilles as Blind man's daughter, and finally Dayna Clark as TV Anchor. The story is three teens Money played by Daniel Zovatto Alex played by Dylan Minnette, Rocky Played by Jane Levy the trio break into a wealthy blind man's house, thinking they will get away with a perfect heist. What happens when they were wrong. now this film is a unique look at a dying genre and in this Horror sub-genre known as the home invasion films, most are played out, but some are that diamond in the rough that hidden gem and for horror, I think it has been found Don't breath leaves you breathless for the most part. doesn't rely on the gimmicks that come with most big budget Horror films and with a small modest budget of only 10 million dollars this film is impressively directed and is a very well done film. Now for my pro's and cons for this film, I'm going to start with my pro's. One thing I loved about this film is the acting, all actors in this film know what their roles are and play them perfectly every character has a purpose and not one character feels unfinished or unnecessary. Every single character had meaning and depth and that's something don't breath does so very well is the chemistry between all 3 of the protagonist against the antagonist you feel urgency and feel true fear this film brings chills thrills and gores galore and it's proud of this and wears it like a horror badge of honor. now another great thing about this film is the cinematography and camera work the pacing follows a specific slow yet sort of in between fast pace. the cinematography feels lifelike each movement is captured in unique ways. this film is utterly terrifying from almost Beginning to end. Now for my cons, this film has no real critical mistakes, for the most part, and does exactly what a horror film should do and that is to leave you terrified which this film does for almost the whole film but by the third act, it starts to get a little to far fetched. I won't spoil anything but it just feels rushed by the end. Overall this film is great and will leave you breathless for the most part but fizzles to a predictable end. However, makes up for it with an incredible first and second act and is still worth checking out in theaters if you're a horror fan that is. I'm giving Don't Breath a solid 8.5 out of 10. <br/><br/>Review by Josh Evoy."
"meredithkemble","6","2","6","1 September 2016"," If I would have known how weird this movie would be, I wouldn't have invited my mother along with me
","This movie generated a lot of hype in it's early screenings, and the trailer seemed to promise a tense and violent romp. It definitely delivered lots of nerve-wrackingly tense moments that had the theater jumping without necessarily using the classic ""jump scare"" tactic. The acting was good, and all of the characters were well- written enough to have a lot of likable and unlikable moments, which was a nice break from usual horror stereotypes. I can see how people would be praising it as a horror masterpiece because it definitely was scary without being cliché. It was a lot of fun to watch in theaters.<br/><br/>So if I have so much positive feedback, why give it a six instead of something higher? The reason is there were at least two very obvious plot holes to me while watching that were never resolved. The beginning of the movie made me somewhat dislike the main characters, who seemed to lack any real intelligence until they're actually trying to survive in the house. The ending was about three scenes too long, and the whole ""evil guy never dies and is also able to be everywhere at once"" mechanic begins to wear a little thin by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Also, there is THAT one scene. Get ready for it. Do not make the same mistake I did and think that the popularity of the movie meant there would not be one extremely weird and disturbing moment that would make you regret bringing your mother along with you. I personally love the weird and slightly obscene in horror movies, but this one does nothing to prepare you for what is to come. Maybe if I had walked into the theater with a different mindset, this movie would have been more successful for me."
"swilliky","8","2","6","30 August 2016"," An intense horror film
","Horror movies continue to impress as Don't Breathe arrives to finish off late summer at the movies. This thriller follows three criminals who break into houses until they break into the wrong one. Rocky (Jane Levy) just wants to escape crumbling Detroit to a life in California, but she needs one more score to have enough cash to leave. Her boyfriend, Money (Daniel Zovatto) hears about a blind veteran who received a large sum of money from a settlement after his daughter died in a car accident. Alex (Dylan Minnette) uses his dad's security guard keys to gain access to houses though this particular location proves more difficult with a vicious dog and an inordinate amount of locks.<br/><br/>Stephen Lang is ferocious as the blind man with dark secrets of his own. Lang stalks through the house creating a horrifying villain without any supernatural help.The acting was great from the three main actors. Dylan Minnette has graduated from the young Goosebumps film to a more adult horror and I hope he continues work in the genre. Jane Levy has shown promise with her appearance in Evil Dead and looks to have a bright future as a young actress. Fede Alvarez directs the film brilliantly with amazing cinematography to enhance the terror.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
"themovieparadise","8","2","6","27 August 2016"," Relentless, tension-filled thriller that adds itself to list of great 2016 horror films
","This movie is absolutely relentless. It quickly sets up its characters and then jumps straight into the plot. What this film does best is it carefully crafts an atmosphere that feels paper thin. It continuously builds this tension, and you yourself begin to feel unnerved. I attribute a lot of this to the directing. Fede Alvarez does a masterful job of maneuvering his way through this movie, making a small environment such as a house feel like an entire world. I really enjoy contained movies, where the characters are locked in a house or a building and they have to make do with the things surrounding them. And that's what Don't Breathe does. Our characters have to think and act using only the things they can find in this house..."
"monstermayhem32","6","2","6","28 August 2016"," An interesting take on home invasion
","I will say the idea of a blind man getting robbed is appalling and sad but i will say for the purposes of the film, it seems to work. The story deals with a trio of robbers Alex, rocky, and money steal items from peoples homes and selling them. Rocky wants to take her sister away from their neglectful mother. The trio discover a blind war veteran who won a wrongful death settlement as a result of his daughters death. The trio think it might be an easy score but little do they now the blind man is not as helpless as he appears and are forced in a battle of survival. I will say while some parts were predictable and laughable but it was a decent film for what it was"
"just_in_case","8","2","6","28 August 2016"," Good but the third act is kinda lame
","Not trying to be too eloquent on this one. If you're expecting a gruesome anti-home invasion slasher that this is not. Kids try to rob a crazy war vet and pay a heavy price. The villain is well played but surprisingly run of the mill. He has an agenda but its not scary or anything. This is more of a thriller more along the lines of ""People under the stairs"" rather than something like bizarre like ""The Collector"". Nearly all the characters are sympathetic. I liked that. If you're going to watch characters breath and creep around its important that they be compelling. <br/><br/>I have to give it an honest 8/10. Don't get me wrong I thoroughly enjoyed the vast majority of the film, but it has some problems.<br/><br/>-1 Stephen Lang's dialog was surprisingly milquetoast. I felt like with the few lines he has it could have been a bit more interesting or poetic. -1 Third act has too many false endings and drags<br/><br/>All that said I wanna give a special nod to them filming in that apparently abandoned neighborhood. I'm curious as to where that was exactly. It really helped the sense of loneliness and lack of escape. It was really creepy."
"thecoolkidvik","7","2","6","27 August 2016"," An enticing film that will make keep you invested
","I went in to this film not expecting to feel scared or frightened, but oh was I wrong. This film manages to frighten you with just the dead silence. Another thing that this film does well is conflict your allegiance with the three main characters. At first, all three of the main characters come off as inconsiderate punks who have no regard for the people they steal from, but as the story progresses when they rob the blind man, you sort of hope they make it out alive when you see how monstrous the blind man can be.<br/><br/>Only drawbacks to this film are some basic logical fallacies. Additionally, I thought the film makers may have over-exaggerated the blind man's abilities. Other than that, I recommend watching this film. It is definitely better than the average horror movie these days."
"kkboyd-603-991354","7","2","6","27 August 2016"," A Tidy Little Thriller
","I admired the pacing, the surprises and general flow of action, all tied up at the end with a pretty ribbon. But the movie somehow left me flat.<br/><br/>Thinking back to classics like Vertigo and North by Northwest, I realized that character does matter even in a Boo movie. At first I liked the idea that we jumped right into the action without a lot of buildup, but then the characters started to feel 2-D.<br/><br/>The girl Rocky wasn't convincing as an abused teen turned bad. She had Good Girl, not Bad Girl, makeup and hair. Alex was a Good Guy with no personality whatsoever. The blind guy was great, though.<br/><br/>The other problem was basic lack of plot. Yes, we don't get Wuthering Heights at a screamfest, but the repetition, albeit with twists, as one critic pointed out, was like a dance. Wham! Wham! Scuttle scuttle scuttle. Wham! Wham! Scuttle scuttle scuttle. It reminded me of a Punch and Judy show.<br/><br/>In spite of the adroit direction, there were odd lapses. SPOILER! In one scene the blind guy is standing over Alex with giant garden shears - then dives for his belly. In a scene not longer afterward, Alex hugs his belly briefly, then gets up and walks around as usual - no hole in gut.<br/><br/>Rocky falls on her head down a steep ventilation shaft but has no broken bones. Not even a concussion. These are hardy teens! Don't Breathe is worth the admission but not worth all the hype."

","Nice little thriller. For the first hour or so, at least.<br/><br/>I went in knowing very little about it with low expectations and was pleased. Very tense. Believable acting. Flawed, but not completely unsympathetic characters kept me engaged. Good cinematography. Editing wasn't distracting. Neither was the music. Nice running time, too; they didn't stretch the movie out to two hours and overstay it's welcome.<br/><br/>Third act had me cringing more from storytelling choices than from the story itself.

Of course, there are also shortcomings: the picture is too dark; the sense of terror is greatly diluted after more fighting in the later stage; although different perspectives have the effect of climax, but the cohesion between the plots is not smooth enough."

","'Don't Breathe' was enjoyable, but it suffers from ""Dumb Characters Doing Dumb Things At The Worse Time"" syndrome. Also, characters just won't die - Throw them through a 2nd story window, shoot them, stab them in the chest with a pair of garden sheets, they ain't dying. The twist is very stupid, and unrealistic. The characters are unlikable. The old man's backstory is a great idea, just poorly executed. But hey, It's certainly not boring."

","Don't Breathe is an instant CLASSIC in MY OPINION!!!
This is a BRILLIANTLY made suspense urban Thriller that is actually scary & very intense.
The abandoned Detroit neighbourhood that this is set in is creepy as hell, the old house that the blind man lives in is creepy too, infact the atmosphere in this movie is edge of the seat intensity, All the actors are FANTASTIC & give excellent performances especially the scary ""Stephen Lang"" as the blind man ,""Dylan Minnette"" & ""Jane Levy"" all amazing!!! This is one hell of an exciting Thriller that feels so real & gritty & very exciting!!!
The cinematography is outstanding & you see that in the birds eye view shots of the old decrepit run-down Detroit neighbourhood, very creepy & well shot, an urban nightmare!!!
All the actors & characters are EXCELLENT!!!
everything about this film is excellent movie making & made with a real love for the dark Thriller genre, even down to the BRILLIANT creepy atmospheric music & an atmosphere full of loneliness & dread.
DON'T BREATHE really is a true instant CLASSIC & has already become one of my favourite movies of all time!!!
One of my favourite Thriller films & just a beautifully made Thriller that i consider abit of a companion piece to ""Judgment Night"" the 1993 urban survival Thriller starring ""Emelio Estevez"" both share similar themes & both are about a small group of young people trying to survive the night in an urban nightmare world whilst being hunted!!! Now ""Judgment Night"" is surviving on the scary streets of Night time Chicago & ""Don't Breathe"" is a group trapped in a big old house of Horror but set in an urban nightmare world too, the abandoned & apocalyptic looking Detroit, so both share the theme of the ""out of your territory"" & both plays to that really scary urban-decay inner city nightmare world!!! Both CLASSIC films & make a great Double feature."

","Alex gets information from his Dad's security company to target houses for burglaries which he carries out with Rocky and Money (he fancies Rocky, but she is Money's girlfriend). Rocky is a victim of her alcoholic mother, Alex would be a decent lad if he wasn't besotted with Rocky, and Money is a despicable sh!t beyond redemption. So another job is lined up....<br/><br/>The target is the only remaining inhabited house in a deserted section of Detroit. The occupant is a blind war veteran who has a settlement from the parents of a girl who killed his daughter in a road accident: that settlement is the target for the burglary. No-one lives nearby, the old guy is blind, and Money has brought along a gun, you know, just in case. What could possibly go wrong?<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen a movie with a similar set-up - it's not uncommon - will know that quite a lot can go wrong, actually. And so it does, And it would be really unfair for me to say any more, for two reasons.<br/><br/>One, this film is very suspenseful, and I wouldn't want to spoiler any of the suspenseful elements as our three young villains try to avoid being detected by the unseeing householder.<br/><br/>And, two, there are a number of occasions where the story takes you into WTF? territory. Perfectly fairly, it turns out, but sudden turns which come at you out of nowhere. I do love a film which suddenly completely wrongfoots you.<br/><br/>Stephen (Avatar) Lang is the blind veteran, but the young unknown actors who play the gang are all very good, too.<br/><br/>Despite having some misgivings over the way the perceived moralities of the characters get played with, I thought this was a rather good suspense thriller."

","Three societal parasites, a skank, a dudebro loser and a useful idiot have been perpetrating burglaries in the dumbest of ways. <br/><br/>Somehow, a list of Useful Idiot's father's home security clients are being burglarized. As if by magic, these homes are thoroughly ransacked, vandalized, looted, before the alarm goes off. Fortunately, these morons live in the Detroit area, where crimes are apparently never investigated. If anyone did investigate, such as a cop in a coma, or Mr. Magoo, they'd immediately suspect a connection between Useful Idiot's dad and the crimes.<br/><br/>Also as if by magic, these losers have gotten word that an old guy in a generally abandoned neighborhood has a lot of cash in his house. As luck would have it, he's also one of Useful Idiot's dad's customers. So, they go over to rob the guy. <br/><br/>He's a blind guy, as it happens. A blind veteran. But they go ahead with the plan anyway. Keep in mind, the piece of crap who wrote this piece of crap expects the audience to regard these robbers of the elderly and infirm as the heroes of the story. But it's at this point that you should be eagerly anticipating whatever horrible thing is about to happen to these creeps.<br/><br/>The scumbags arrive at the house, and drug his dog. More winning. The house is locked up like a vault. They break in with some effort.<br/><br/>At this point, any action by the occupant of the house to deter or defend against this home invasion is justified. But this is augmented by the additional threat of the dudebro packing heat. After dudebro fails to force the blind veteran to ingest harmful chemicals (sleeping gas cooked up in a soda bottle), he menaces THE VICTIM with his firearm. Because he's a stupid dudebro thug with bad hair and neck tattoos and zero firearms training, the veteran easily disarms him and kills him with his own weapon. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is a panicked attempt by the vermin to escape the house with the veteran's money before he gets his hands on them. <br/><br/>There's a subplot, sure. A wealthy woman has caused the death of the veteran's daughter. She isn't held legally responsible. Somehow, this blind guy has managed to abduct the woman, hold her captive in his basement, and has inseminated her, artificially. His deal is that she owes him a daughter. No, I'm not kidding. Somebody actually wrote that.<br/><br/>As the human garbage attempts to flee through the cellar, they stumble upon this woman, free her, attempt to escape with her, and she ends up being shot and killed by the veteran. Outraged, he then intends to capture the skank and inseminate her instead. The movie shows a lovely closeup of a public hair in a container of old man sperm as it's being drawn into a turkey baster type syringe. Thanks, movie. This syringe is later shoved into the old man's mouth and deployed with much sputtering. Thanks again, movie.<br/><br/>Which of course suggests that the skank is rescued by the Useful Idiot. Too bad. But at least the idiot doesn't make it out of the house. He finally dies trying to unlock the front door. <br/><br/>But the skank is sadly lucky. She escapes after she ostensibly kills the old guy.<br/><br/>As she's about to depart for her glorious future as a dead former meth-addicted porn star in California, she sees a news story about the burglary of the old guy, which says that he survived. She looks alarmed.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the plug line for the proposed sequel to this flick: ""The blind old man returns to terrorize more unsuspecting people.""<br/><br/>I do beg your pardon, movie, but the guy terrorized no one. The movie was about sociopaths who attempted to prey upon the man. <br/><br/>The main characters were criminals, and no one should be glad this woman got away with her numerous crimes.<br/><br/>Gave it a 4 rating for production value."

","Three young punks - Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette), and ""Money"" (Daniel Zovatto) - are experienced at home robberies. Rocky and Alex (who's in love with her) are somewhat more even keeled. ""Money"" is just a plain pile of scum. They hear about a potential huge windfall to come from invading the home of an isolated, blind Iraq war vet (Stephen Lang). Supposedly he got a nice juicy settlement from the filthy rich family of a girl who'd killed the vets' daughter in a traffic accident.<br/><br/>Getting inside the house is not too hard. However, the blind man is much more formidable an adversary than these brainless punks realize.<br/><br/>I can see how many viewers would take the story (concocted by Rodo Sayagues and director Fede Alvarez) to task. There's barely a believable moment in it, starting with the fact that it takes an eternity before we ever hear police sirens, despite all the gunfire throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Provided viewers can put their own brains in neutral, there IS entertainment to be derived from ""Don't Breathe"", but that's due to the execution, not the concept. Alvarez creates some effective suspense and atmosphere within this house, and there's visceral pleasures to be had from the violence. (If you can't stand any of the characters, you might at least enjoy seeing them being put through so much hell.) The script manages at least one amusing twist - which makes no sense, but does put Langs' character into perspective for you.<br/><br/>The acting from Levy, Minnette, and Zovatto is adequate; her more so than the others, because she at least gets a character that is fleshed out to some degree. Veteran actor Lang, who's often specialized in creepy or outright psychotic roles, steals the show as the blind man, even if he only has about 13 lines or so, most of them towards the end of the picture.<br/><br/>Filmed in (and set in) Detroit, although the interiors of the house were actually done in a studio in Hungary.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

"crberme","7","1","2","5 November 2017"," Things get way out of hand in this good horror movie
","I stopped watching horror movies some time ago because I think they rely too much on jump scares or easy terrifying things nowadays, but I gave this one a shot since I saw it recommended somewhere. Take that in mind while reading my review, specially if you think as I do.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe starts off with a trio of thieves that are basically experts into breaking into houses, getting expensive things and running away with it. They have a rule, thought: no money. Suddenly, impulse by their desires of running away from their lives, they plan on get into a n old veteran's house, who's blind but has a ridiculous amount of money. Things seem easy, but something goes away from their eyes and they end up on the most complicated night of their lives.<br/><br/>This movie starts slow. Not too slow, but expect something like 15 minutes of character background and set up before the plot takes off and things get interesting. I think it's a good thing since not everything has to be scares in this type of movies (like, give my heart a rest before it explodes out of my chest if possible), but worth point out.<br/><br/>I personally love when a horror movie has a strong bad character that leaves the protagonist(s) with only the option to run and hide, and this movie really has that. The blind man (his name is not revealed in the movie) is like the unbeatable final boss in a video game, and being blind isn't that much of a handicap for him since his always a step ahead. It also matches with the fact that he's a veteran, it doesn't look like he has superpowers. It's a well done and rounded character, I like him.<br/><br/>So, without further ado, here's my recommendation: watch it, it's good."

Does this one backfire on the perpetrators? You'll have to watch and find out on your own. It's a good movie and worth a viewing. In my opinion, the moral of this story is to not do unto others anything you would not want done unto you. Put yourself in the intended victim's shoes first and ask yourself if you would want someone to do that to you. If you don't want it done unto you, then don't do it unto me."

","This is an almost perfect movie, for what it tries to do: entertain and shock. <br/><br/>The story has got its twists and surprises, so it's not that predictable, but stays very simple (in a good way), and uses the very cool premise to its advantage. It starts and ends at the perfect moment, and has great pacing, so it never feels long, or drags out. The movie is very grounded, so when the violence comes, you feel it, and it almost never goes to far, so you don't get taken out of the movie.<br/><br/>It looks great, but shows dirty and disgusting things so it has a classy trash feeling, some might say. <br/><br/>If you like horror movies or thrillers, and is are not shocked by violence and gore, it will be an easy, fun watch for you but i would not recommend it to sensitive watchers."

","Very shocked of the way this movie was delivered as to say the least. Has got to be one of the most hypocritical stories ever. Three kids break into a wealthy blind man's house attempting to steal his fortune. The premise is - 3 kids = bad, poor old blind man = good, yet it gets turned around completely to manifest into the most hypocritical story line i have ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>There are a lot of errors in this movie, the blind man is doing things completely impossible for someone with his disability, he is navigating through obstacles with ease fighting people and shooting guns, seemingly he can easily set up complicated structures/ kidnap people too as revealed later. The premise was cool and they should have gone with it, but they chose to completely derail the plot into this mess. The dog was a cool accomplice to the blind guy, but it had inconsistent appearances, it would just randomly disappear and then appear out of nowhere, when convenient for the plot.<br/><br/>Aside from all the massive flaws here, the action was somewhat decent, the only thing ruining the vibe is you not understanding who to root for here, because the spotlights keep changing all the time. Had a couple of good fight scenes, especially the ones involving the dog. The ending was somewhat decent, possibly insinuating a sequel, which would have to be insanely impossible knowing how everything ended and the fact the main guy is blind.<br/><br/>Overall nothing special, easily forgettable, because of its massive logical flaws and fails. Another great premise poorly executed, sadly."

","I rate this film 5 because, as a thriller, it did hold my attention and gives a thrill ride. Despite most reviews, I kind of like the darkness in the atmosphere. It makes the film look mysterious and a bit scary. I also like the way the camera moves in unpredictable way. However, this film is morally rotten and its ending made me angry. It makes me hate this movie and never want to watch it again and will not recommend anyone to watch it at all.<br/><br/>(Big Spoiler Ahead)<br/><br/>This movie has terrible story. I mean, the protagonist girl is selfish and cruel for breaking into a blind old man house to get all of his spare money so that she can live the life she wants. To me, I cheer for the old man most of the time to kill Money and Rocky and maybe sparing Alex, who seems to be the most decent among them. Then I found out that he is also a criminal. But still...to me, the motivation of the blind man for becoming deranged and lock that rich girl who killed his child and got away in the basement until she gives him a baby is more understandable and deserve more sympathy than what the protagonist girl did. Do you think stealing all the save money of a blind old man who lives alone is something to celebrate? The triumph of the protagonist girl in the ending makes me feel how morally rotten the world has become."

","Classified as crime/horror/thriller, I consider it more like an intense action movie with many violent scenes and some scares, but not horror.<br/><br/>Three criminals, two men (Alex and Money) and one woman (Rocky), decide to rob the home of a blind man who apparently is not as defenseless as he looks, being a former decorated war veteran.<br/><br/>Despite the implausibility of this whole scenario (you really need to see it to believe it, believe me!!!) and the ambiguous and dubious message, the camera work and the acting are of such a great level (mainly the blind man) that it truly works against all odds, creating a constant feeling of tension and claustrophobia. All these are strong aspects that carry this movie in a good direction, as well as the fact of all the characters being antagonistic, with none of them being a hero of the moral virtues. Moreover, and even because of this, this movie divides the spectators opinions creating intense discussions, which is always a good thing :) - hence I score it a little higher than I should: 6/10."

Without spoiling anything, there's a part when it cuts to black and I thought to myself ""Perfect. Let's go home to write an awesome review"" ... And then it fades back in. The next few minutes don't add anything to the story and it can actually leave you frustrated like it left me.

Ultimately most of the characters are unlikable and has some moments that make you suspend your disbelief however Don't Breathe uses some of your own preconceived notions in its favor.

I'm not given a reason to root for the thieves, and none to care for the blind man, and after 50 minutes of clichés I just wanted them to kill them, because they deserved it, but it's not gory enough to enjoy. Then they discover the girl in the basement and sort of ""justifies"" their actions. Predictable, awful, boring, plain, abject failure that makes one immediately regret having watched this movie. It's not a matter of taste, when you put two bad guys against each other and kind of condone the actions of either one you end up with the mess this movie is: Not thriller, not drama, no horror, no discernible genres, no dialog, no plot. So many horror movies end up being involuntary comedies, this one is just on the angry side of ""meh"", the angry part being the girl keeping the money.

"gavin6942","7","2","7","28 November 2016"," A New Twist on Home Invasion
","Hoping to walk away with a massive fortune, a trio of thieves break into the house of a blind man (Stephen Lang) who isn't as helpless as he seems.<br/><br/>Those who are going in to see ""Don't Breathe"" should do so with as little knowledge as possible. You can know it is a horror film in the ""home invasion"" subgenre. You can know there is a twist (the back of the box reveals as much). But you should not know what that twist is, and only know that even in a world full of movie twists, this one may be unexpected.<br/><br/>Not knowing anything, I thought maybe this would be like a modern retelling of ""Wait Until Dark"". It is nothing like that at all. And because I knew it was a home invasion story with a twist, I immediately thought of ""Shut In"", the recent film starring Rory Culkin. It isn't really like that, either, beyond some superficial similarities.<br/><br/>The film's biggest weakness comes in the first fifteen minutes. We are given a somewhat sympathetic view of our burglars, and one that seems off. All three leads have a presence in the modern history of horror, being in such films as ""Goosebumps"" and ""It Follows"". But here, they are most effective as burglars rather than as tragic figures. At no point was I on the side of Rocky because of her troubled childhood. Maybe other viewers will approach the film differently, but I don't see personal problems as an excuse to victimize other people.<br/><br/>After those initial fifteen minutes, the attempt at character development stops and the film really goes into high gear. We get plenty of tense scenes, over-the-top violence, and moments that call to mind the ""Saw"" series or ""The Collector"" (though this film never goes as far as the so-called torture porn aspects of either of those other two). Whether you are rooting for our protagonists or not (I wasn't), you can't help but be strapped in for the remainder of the ride.<br/><br/>I must address the praise from the box. Forbes says the movie has ""the best twist in years"", which I may or may not agree with, but cannot deny that there are parts that surprise even the most hardened viewer. I do, however, take issue with the quote from Jim Hemphill, calling this the ""best American horror film in twenty years"". Ignoring what defines ""American"" (the writer-director is from Uruguay and the film was made in Hungary), is this really the best horror film since 1996? Hemphill was not quoted out of context; this is really what he thinks.<br/><br/>I can comfortably call ""Don't Breathe"" one of the best horror films of the last decade. I could even say it is possibly the best horror film of 2016, but a few others (such as ""The Unseen"" or ""The Witch"") could edge it out. But the best of all the horror films since 1996? Off the top of my head, ""It Follows"" is a better film. ""House of the Devil"" is better, as well. Some would probably argue that ""Blair Witch"" was better, or at the very least more influential. Again, I'm not trying to say ""Don't Breathe"" isn't a strong horror film (it is), but Hemphill is probably in the minority.<br/><br/>The Blu-ray, out now from Sony, brings the film to your home looking and sounding great. There are also eight deleted scenes, five behind-the-scenes featurettes on the cast, crew, set and sound. And if you're into the stories behind the movie itself, there is a feature-length commentary with the director (Fede Alvarez), writer (Rodo Sayagues) and star Stephen Lang."

","""It's kind of messed up to rob a blind guy, isn't it?"" Rocky (Levy) and her friends want to get out of Detroit and are willing to do anything they can to make this happen. After robbing houses for very little money they decide to go for broke. Their mark is an old veteran (Lange)who has $300,000 in his house. When they find out he is blind they think it will be easy, but this is no ordinary blind man. This is a movie that could have gone two ways. Super cheesy and cliché, or tense and original. For me, this was the latter. This is not a typical horror movie in the way that it is not full of random jump scares or possessions. This is also, thankfully, not a ""found- footage"" or Saw type horror where it relies on gore to scare you. This is movie a more tense Purge-like movie. 4 people are trapped inside a house where being the last one standing is the only way out. This movie does add more and more suspense and, surprises to keep it feeling fresh. The best part of this movie though it that, unlike most recent horror, there is an actual story and character development. That aspect makes you question and wonder who you should root for. That extra layer really makes this movie work and is one of the better horror movies I have seen in the last few years. Overall, a horror movie with a story and characters you actually care about. That is rare these days. I surprisingly give this a B+."
"imdb-45","6","2","7","10 September 2016"," Good effort but vastly overrated, stretched out horror flick
","Sadly so many of these noir/horror movies are made with great effort only to be spoiled by a handful of incredibly lame, stupid and lazy plot points. If you blindly accept the lazy setup, the first 2/3 of the film are well crafted before it devolves into a prolonged effort to keep the story going for an extra 20 minutes or else you'd have just a film an hour long.<br/><br/>The premise - 3 struggling Detroit 20 somethings rob homes by using alarm codes that are accessible to the father of one of the youths and stolen by the father's son. For some odd reason one of the youths heard that a horrible looking home is where an old army veteran lived who received a large settlement from a car accident lawsuit, which claimed the life of his daughter. Why they are sure that this man, who is supposedly blind, are so damn sure that the cash will be stored in the house and that they will somehow be able to find it and extract it is dubious at best. But let's play along with that scheme.<br/><br/>It takes a while for the setup to take place where the trio break into the old man's home to find quite a number of surprises. The first third and the early scenes are well done. The movie moves along at a reasonably quick pace with clichéd characters on the side but they don't really distract from the main attraction. The problems occur when the typical horror film implausibilities begin to take place. And while there is excellent suspense for a good part of the film, it takes the easy way out a number of times which lead to a realistic feeling horror/noir film becoming a bit of a self- parody, which many of them are.<br/><br/>Without giving the film away, the typical elements of horror films are there - characters that are almost impossible to kill because they are needed to prolong screen time. Chase scenes that someone allow characters to escape and show multiple views of the same characters with the attacker stuck in the same place for several different angles so that the protagonist can get away, albeit temporarily. It's not so bad at first but when you're at the 60 minute run time, it starts to become very noticeable. <br/><br/>And the most disappointing part has to be the ending. It's supposed to provide your typical ""woah"" ending but mine was rolling my eyes at the ceiling at this film's way too hard effort to end up in such a fashion. They forced it badly.<br/><br/>None of these detriments will ruin at least one view of the film. It's totally forgettable derivative drivel. But the suspenseful moments are well crafted and at least for an hour it will keep you entertained and wondering what will happen next. Could and should have been better. It's a B+ -- and at least it's not another dumb Saw torture porn film. This one is more about suspense."

","Don't Breathe (2016): Dir: Fede Alvarez / Cast: Stephen Lang, Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto, Jane Graves: Shocking horror film with a title that brings light to the nearness of evil. Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto play Rocky, Alex and Money respectably. They are aiming to blow town for California and rob houses for priceless items to pond off. They target a house in an abandoned neighborhood that is owned by Norman Nordstrom, a blind army veteran. The three thieves aim to steal a fortune he has stashed but get more than they bargained for. After putting his attack dog to sleep they search for the money only to awaken Norman. After killing Money, Alex and Rocky struggle to survive a brutal set of events that lead them into the basement where further dire discoveries are made that address the vengeful nature of Norman. He is played by Stephen Lang whose lack of sight allows for keen hearing and a decent aim. His daughter was killed by a drunk driver and the guilty was set free due to wealth. The result of this brings frightening insight into his mental stability and his raging desire to restore what is lost. Director Fede Alvarez previously made the gruesome remake to Evil Dead. Here the violence is also extreme but not nearly as graphic. It contains a strong theme presenting one's desire for riches and the consequences for coveting. Lang is menacing as Norman whose skill has limitations. Levy discovers her mistakes way to late and their impact upon others resulting in her being dragged by the hair down the vacant street reflecting how she got there in the first place. Score: 9 / 10"
"Coventry","4","2","8","21 March 2017"," In the home of the blind, the blind is still the king!
","In many of the reviews, user-comments and movie blog discussions that I encountered recently, ""Don't Breathe"" is referred to as one of the most intense, horrifying and genuinely shocking horror/thrillers of the past 10-15 years Is it now? Is it really, or are we simply not seeing enough intense and genuinely shocking thrillers lately? Because, after all, ""Don't Breathe"" is only a very simplistic and derivative story with stereotypical lead characters, highly questionable plot twists and only a handful of semi-decent jump scenes that you can feel coming well in advance. There's a reasonably uncanny and grim atmosphere throughout, and Stephen Lang puts down a solid anti-hero performance, but aside from that ""Don't Breathe"" is a very routine and forgettable heist-gone-wrong thriller. Fede Alvarez did a fairly respectable job remaking the almighty horror classic ""The Evil Dead"", and apparently Sam Raimi thought so too, as he appears on the credits as executive producer for Alvarez' newest and very own film baby. Three amateur teen burglars from the lower Detroit (or was it Chicago?) social middle- class think they have stumbled on the opportunity of a lifetime. They will break into the home of a former Gulf War veteran who allegedly stores a large sum of money from when his only daughter got killed in a road accident. It's guaranteed to be a piece of cake, since the veteran is the sole remaining resident in a pauperized housing area and, moreover, he turns out to be as blind as a bat! Of course it quickly becomes abundantly clear that they made a big mistake, for starters because our veteran owns a vicious Rottweiler dog (that is not blind) and, secondly, he isn't just a helpless disabled person but a genuinely relentless psychopath. The three teen burglars are hopelessly clichéd and cardboard characters. The self-acclaimed leader is tough but typically ruthless and dumb, then there's the overly cautious nerd who only participates because he's got a crush on the leader's cute girlfriend. And, obviously, the girlfriend in question – Rocky – is basically a good person but she only turns to criminal facts because she desperately wants to offer her little sister a better life, far away from their alcoholic mother. Yawn! Thrillers/horror movies with blind protagonists that can seriously kick ass aren't exactly scarce, neither. Only recently, for example, there also was the sublime movie ""Late Phases"" in which another blind middle-aged war veteran single- handedly battles a bloodthirsty werewolf. That guy lost his dog at the beginning of the film, but still he was tougher and more narcissist and – most of all – he didn't do stuff that blind people can't possibly do! Somewhere halfway in the plot of ""Don't Breathe"", the burglars discover a dark and horrifying secret in the blind man's basement. This initially seems like an inventive and surprising plot twist, but not if contemplate about it a bit further. How on earth a blind person capable of arranging all this, I'd really like to know. ""Don't Breathe"" certainly isn't a bad film, but judging by the current rating and the numerous praising reviews, I can safely say it's one of the most overrated thrillers of the past years."
"bodhi-13262","6","2","8","26 August 2016"," Seeing is believing, and he can't.
","'Don't Breathe' is a film which cleverly shows that horror comes in many forms. Three young robbers mark a blind man's house to steal his funds, but 'underestimating' is something thieves do best. However, does a premise and film such as this deliver?<br/><br/>1. The first noticeable thing about this film is the tone. The production designers did a terrific job in setting up the creepy atmosphere as well as finding the perfect house where all the alarming events take place. Of course, the attempted theft takes place at night, so the audience follows these characters through the dark maze of the blind man's house. The cinematography is especially fantastic as the camera smoothly navigates it's way through hallways, basements and tight crawl spaces.<br/><br/>2. The three robbers are played by Jane Levy (Rocky), Dylan Minnette (Alex) & Daniel Zovatto (Money) respectively. The real horror establishes itself when one of the three meets their untimely and gruesome death. We quickly learn just how dangerous the blind man is when things take a turn for the worst. Jane Levy has more screen- time as she is proved to be the most sympathetic character when we learn of her backstory. Dylan Minnette is more of the innocent one who just follows orders at the behest of his crush on Rocky (Jane Levy).<br/><br/>3. Last but not least, the 'Blind Man' himself, who is terrifyingly portrayed by Stephen Lang. Normally in a situation like this, the audience should be on his side, but his tactics prove to be lethal and brutal to a degree where you end up hoping the robbers survive his entrapment. The movie nose dives when more is revealed about the blind man and things turn insanely creepy. For all the suspense accumulated during the first half, I lost all faith the moment my stomach began to churn from the disgusting ordeal presented.<br/><br/>There are too many moments of false hope near the climax and the movie makes you feel like it just doesn't know where and how to properly end things. I do give a lot of credit to director Fede Alvarez, but things unfortunately fall out of place and sources by the end."

"Sheldonshells","1","1","3","9 June 2018"," The girl with the guy's name is the one to get away, gee, how original and innovative
","And that' s not a spoiler, as anyone with a brain could predict that the moment they saw the lead female character whose name is ""Rocky"" (ugh *face palms*). I guess the director/writer didn't get the memo that giving female characters male names is one of the most tired, overdone, cliched things you could do. Once you hear that, that pretty much foreshadows how tired, overdone, and cliched this movie is in general, finally culminating in the ultimate ""Last Girl"" and damsel in distress cliches<br/><br/>First off, what an enlightened depiction of the blind. I guess the person who directed this (his name is not really worth mentioning) didn't receive any funding from the American Foundation for the Blind. And the one black character has barely any screentime and dies first. Hey look, yet even more innovation and originality. You basically can't get anymore clichéd than that. And this is a movie set in Detroit (with its large black population), which makes that doubly insulting and stupid. I can tell this director is really progressive. Not sure if the sarcasm is coming off here. The other characters are mostly stock types too, and obnoxious to boot (which is what I wanted to do to ""Rocky"" especially). <br/><br/>I suppose in another great act of innovation and originality, there's a failed attempt to make the lead (surprise!) female character the most sympathetic by contriving an abusive background for her and trying to justify her robbing a huge amount of money from a blind person in order to save her (surprise!) little sister from said abusive background. But it really very much feels like she's only out to save herself. Does the director/writer actually think we're supposed to root for this scum chick who was trying to rob a blind man who had just lost his daughter (oop! Another female! Surprise! ) And this was before they even knew, btw, that he captured the woman (Yet another female...surprise...) who gave him the money. I guess having a male captive and expect people to feel sympathy for him would be just too innovative and original for them to handle. <br/><br/>Apparently it never occurred to this director or writer that making only female characters the ones we're expected to care about and have sympathy for is sexist. But with the way, as I've mentioned, this mediocre hack no-talent depicts the blind and black people, I guess we all already knew he's not the most enlightened person (in addition to being untalented and unoriginal, to boot). This movie actually might have been somewhat redeemed if the ending was different and the formulaic Rocky character finally got hers after all by the blind man in some clever and inventive way or something. It would also have been much more horror-like to do so - although not for me. I guess that wouldn't have been a scary ending for me because I was actually rooting for her to die. I would have just cheered. But for others it could have been much scarier and more effective since this is supposed to be a scary movie....isn't it?<br/><br/>What's with the overhype and uncritical critical reviews so many sub-par and mediocre horror movies, and lame movies in general, these days get? I know pervasive collective mental illness, poisonous ideology, and general brain fugue from a desperate and depressed population who probably couldn't handle anything that's actually original, innovative, and truly terrifying has something to do with it, but can that explain it all away? <br/><br/>Then again, when I see the rather mediocre (and much more deserving) 7.1 this movie now has here, I guess alls not wrong with the world after all. This kind of thing tends to happen after the original false hype dissipates and people generally forget about it and move on to another piece of nose tissue, which they will no doubt just as quickly blow their nose on, and just as quickly throw away and forget about just as they had the previous one. And so on.<br/><br/>1 out of 10 stars. And it can be happy and lucky it got that."

The whole story does nothing special and especially does not make sense. 3 guys go for 300K and don't seem to get to an agreement until the girl needs to be helped out of her unpleasant life. From there on out it goes wrong. The motivation is wrong, the clichés are wrong, the backstory of the blind guy they want to rob is wrong. How does a blind guy get a girl trapped in his basement, saying 'rich girls never go to jail', but he can keep her in his own home, and cops never go look for her in his house even though he's suspect number 1 because she killed his daughter in an accident. I am still wondering how I ever came to end this movie. The dog in car part took too long, him finding her eventually was ridiculous. You know what, if you want to spend 1.5 hours of your life wasting it on a bad movie, this should be a good pick for you. end of rant."
"Ingrouille181","9","1","3","4 July 2017"," A fun and nerve wrecking little horror classic
","I don't really go to see the independent movies in theaters, but the cast and the premise for this movie was more than appealing to me. Stephen Lang I've known since Avatar, Jane Levy I've known since the Evil Dead remake, and I like Dylan Minnette who was previously in the Ghostbusters movie with Jack Black. To me this film had the same tone and appeal ""It Follows"" did, but whereas that film built up the tension, Don't Breathe felt like it had a pulse, every time you think it'll die down the tension and fear smacks you in the face, leaving no time to relax. The film centres around a group of three young home invaders who decide to target the home of an old blind war veteran, who they know has a large sum of money stored in his home, the last inhabited home in a rundown Detroit neighborhood. Little do they know, this blind old man is far from helpless, and a simple home invasion quickly becomes a nightmare.<br/><br/>That alone got me hooked. Finding out the director of Don't Breathe Fede Alvarez had also directed the Evil Dead remake, I knew I'd be in for a surprise, and I wasn't disappointed. There are so many ways the situation could have been avoided in a typical horror film like this, but Alvarez made make perfect care to quickly negate any of these options; the characters have to be fast on their feet and know how to handle the situation before Lang's character finds them. At no point was I rolling my eyes and finding ways the director could have made a scene better; everything fits into place. Now there probably was a few times the characters made stupid decisions, but considering it wasn't in their position, I forgave them being too panicked to think properly. I wish more of these independent movies would be produced to wash out all of the found footage tripe we get each year. I want horror films to respect the audience instead of treating us like we're stupid.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 out of 10"
"AdamCatalyst","7","1","3","23 May 2017"," Cruel and unusual
","In some ways it is similar to Green Room in that's its technically suspense thriller, but directed like a horror movie, until it eventually becomes one.<br/><br/>Suffers from the obvious problem of the premise: no likeable characters. At its best the movie very surprisingly transcends this limitation with relentless suspense and some truly unexpected and horrifying surprises. At its worst it feels like a tedious exercise in depraved masochism.<br/><br/>It is even more stylish than the director's previous efforts in Evil Dead. Beautifully photographed. I'll give it a 7/10 in spite of its fundamental flaws. Glad I took the time to watch it."

","I didn't read the user reviews prior to watching, the IMDb write up and it's average user score was enough for me, well, what a fantastic movie, credit due to the writers and directors and of course the small 4 many actors. Don't let the number of cast put you off, this movie (trying hard not to give anything away) has so many twists and turns, just when you are happy with your choice nearing the end of the film, then ""POW"" smack in the face, again and again. I can't say much more than the IMDb write up of a group of youths involved in petty crime decide to rob a War Veteran whom lost his only daughter in a car accident with rumors of a big pay out. The veteran is also blind so, they think him an easy target. Yes you are thinking what I did, classic of a trained veteran turning the tables, well think again as this movie is so much more and worth the time to watch it. I would say that a prequel would be a welcome addition and even a sequel would be worth a look. I will be watching out in the hop the make a new movie. Also if this is the type of quality film the directors and writers put out, again they will be on my watch list. Congratulations on a great movie, I would like to give a 8.5 but I can't do that, so it is worth a 9."

The acting and story were great as well as the thrill of jump scares that will actually make you jump. I love the concept of the blind man being the main antagonist of the film, it's something different that you don't normally see. Another valuable thing for the movie is that you actually care about the characters in the film especially Rocky. I love her backstory and the reason she wants to get the blind mans money (to get her and her sister out of her drug abusing mothers home). Adding to all the suspense, the delinquents also uncover something deeper about the blind man while exploring his basement, and its not very pretty. The ending also leaves the door open for a hopeful sequel. I definitely recommend this movie to horror fans who are ready to tread new ground and finally be scared once again."

","This has been done before, with the protagonists being women instead of a man; Audrey Hepburn in ""wait Until Dark"" and Mia Farrow in ""See No Evil"" were blind victims avoiding bad people.

Two men and a woman rob houses using information obtained by a guy whose father runs a home alarm company and so he has the codes to disable the alarms. The trio hear of a large amount of cash in the blind mans house and they figure it should be easy pickings. Not so fast, boys and girl, this victim is one tough son of a bitch with a vicious Rottweiler to provide an extra layer of nastiness.

","Don't Breathe comes across mostly as a clever low-budget thriller with a brilliant set-up which almost works but is ultimately let down by a flawed execution, The initial plot of a trio of house-breakers relying on one of their gang to obtain inside information, and equally importantly keys, to target properties is a good one. Even more so when the latest target is a blind army veteran sitting on a fortune. The drama of this main event starts off well, but the terrific scenes of suspense are undone by inexplicable inconsistencies such as rooms with all windows barred suddenly having a character thrown through one without resistance and the tired old device of a character who clearly should be .dead regaining consciousness at a convenient point. Add this to the veteran's transformation between wily tough guy to complete idiot and a movie that promised to be a 7 or 8 rating ends up a 6. Worth a watch if you can overlook the inconsistencies"

And when I actually started to watch the movie I got even more impressed by the way everything was thought out. Not a single detail was missed. The script was very precise and left no knot untied.<br/><br/>CONS: The biggest issue lied with the way the movie was built up. There was so many high moments it was difficult to find a climax. You ended up getting bored because you were already at your highest point, and they just kept going higher and higher to a point that you couldn't keep up with them. The movie felt like it went from 0 to 100 and you got left behind. And the whole time you were hoping that the movie would come to a solid resolution, but no.

"shobanchittuprolu","7","1","4","23 March 2017"," Don't Breathe is a brilliant scary home invasion film which thrills you and a twist which disgusts you/
","Don't Breathe (2017): Recently I have watched two home invasion films Hush (2016) and The Strangers (2007). Hush is thrilling at its best but doesn't scare us and The Strangers is one of the most scariest thrillers I had ever seen but has very slow start.Don't Breathe has both qualities of Hush and The Strangers i.e.. both scary and engaging from the start but a awful twist spoiled the feel a bit.<br/><br/>Plot: Rocky (Jane Levy), a young woman wanting to start a better life for her and her sister, agrees to take part in the robbery of a house owned by a wealthy blind man (Stephen Lang) with her boyfriend Money (Daniel Zovatto) and their friend Alex (Dylan Minnette). But when the blind man turns out to be a more ruthless adversary than he seems, the group must find a way to escape his home before they become his newest victims.<br/><br/>Plus Points:<br/><br/>1)Screenplay and Direction: Don't Breathe doesn't delay and enters the setup within a few minutes.Once they enter the house the movie becomes a scary thrilling ride where even audience awaits the sudden appearance of The Blind Man from nowhere.There are lot of nail biting scenes when the intruders hide from The Blind Man and especially when he turns off the power,the scene becomes more tense. Almost every scene finds new and creative ways to make these characters fight for their lives, whether it be in the crawling in the dark, running for their lives, or simply placed into increasingly tighter and tighter spaces. There's practically a scene to capitalize on every type of phobia imaginable, and Don't Breathe is perfectly paced in its ability to deliver fantastic scares.<br/><br/>2)Sound Design: Don't Breathe is a master class in tension, and while its script could have been written on the back of an envelope, its editing and use of sound design is a triumph for film theorists.BGM made the scene more tense and during jump scares the sound design is excellent.<br/><br/>3)Cinematography: The Blind Man's house is a normal old rotten house but a top notch cinematography gave it a view of an inescapable maze. Particularly its use of long tracking shots to establish the geography of its single location. Painstaking effort went into the look of this movie, and it shows. There's just no denying that, even in a terrible looking location, Don't Breathe is a beautiful looking movie.<br/><br/>4)Performances: Stephan Lang as The Blind Man has all the qualities for becoming a latest horror icon.He deserves the majority of the acting credit for his sadistic yet almost sympathetic portrayal of The Blind Man.Jane Levy's wide eyed pupils are an asset as it portrayed lot of emotions.Her fear,her desperation,her helplessness.Close Up shots of her face is brilliant.<br/><br/>Minus Points:<br/><br/>1)Twist: Don't Breathe could have been a flawless thriller if it would have continued the same flow but it has this awful twist which spoiled the feel of the movie.The twist is so out of sync and it is clear that director want to have a violent scene even it it is not necessary.<br/><br/>SO,Don't Breathe is a brilliant scary home invasion film which thrills you and a twist which disgusts you/<br/><br/>My rating 7.5/10"

","A relentlessly brutal, frill-free horror, it pits three reckless teens against a battle-hardened enemy who takes no prisoners and who keeps them on the run within the confines of a run-down house where every floor board can give them away. Turning stories of blind victims as well as of similar home invasions on their head, the film catches you by surprise as it builds its own central premise: of robbers desperate to get out.<br/><br/>Speaking of the premise, I advise you to watch this movie cold. The less you know about it the better. In fact, if you're overly finicky about even the slightest spoilers, wait till you've seen the movie before reading on. Not that there are going to be spoilers, but sometimes, simply knowing that there is going to be a twist is distracting enough.<br/><br/>The mark (a menacing Stephen Lang), it is revealed, is an unstoppable force of nature.<br/><br/>This isn't just any old home invasion thriller, even though it owes a great debt to classics like The Last House on the Left, Straw Dogs or Panic Room. It takes the conventions of the genre and doesn't so much flip them on their head as it shoots them in the face. Point blank. It understands the limitations of the genre and works wonders within them.<br/><br/>While the film manages to smartly get back on its feet, it is clear Alvarez got greedy and extended Don't Breathe past its ideal running time. The thing is — and here is what makes Don't Breathe the standout horror of this year — you may be holding your breath till the last."

When they think they're going to do a last big hit they encounter an at first sight easy job because the occupant is a blind old man.

This movie basically centers on 3 thieves Rocky,Money and Alex who break into the house of a sick old man who's a war veteran that had lost his only daughter because they're told he has money hidden in there but they didn't expect him to wake up and start defending himself I say that loosely because he kills 2 of them Money and Alex shoots both of them...Money is in the beginning when they first break in and find the closet where he keeps the safe which is locked and as I said the man wakes up because he heard how the lock was blown off that was most likely the reason and he catches Money out because he steps on it then ends up shooting him in front of Rocky that was a pretty messed up scene Alex is killed later. Later in the film as well when Rocky and Alex are trying to escape they found a woman in the house handcuffed and tied up that was the woman that killed the man's daughter he was keeping her there because she was pregnant with his baby he promised her he'd let her go as soon as she gave him a new child which is why he was so upset when he'd realized that she had gotten shot by a bullet from his gun.

","""Don't Breathe"" was a movie that I had initially been looking forward to watching, as people had mentioned to me that this was definitely a horror movie worth watching. And given the amount of horror movies that I do watch, I decided to listen to these people.<br/><br/>And now that I have seen ""Don't Breathe"", color me unimpressed. Sure it was an entertaining enough movie for what it turned out to be. But it was hardly the thing that it was hyped up to be. Perhaps I am just too seasoned to the horror genre, but for me this was just a mediocre delve into the thriller genre that offered nothing new to the genre.<br/><br/>It should be said that the acting was good here, and Stephen Lang really carried the movie quite well with his performance.<br/><br/>What was wrong with ""Don't Breathe"" was its overwhelming predictability. If you are accustomed to horrors and thrillers, then you will be more than familiar with the blueprint that ""Don't Breathe"" follows to the letter. As such, you know what will happen a mile away before it does happen on the screen. And that was, at least for me, a massive cumbersome anchor around this movie, dragging it down.<br/><br/>The story in ""Don't Breathe"" is about three young people who make their living by burglarizing people's homes. They break into an old house in a rundown and mostly deserted part of town. What they thought would be easy pickings from a blind old man, turns out to be a night of sheer terror as the man is far more capable at putting up a fight.<br/><br/>Indeed, a straight forward storyline. But wait, there is a twist to it. I will not spoil it by mentioning anything about this plot twist. However, I will say that when it was revealed, it didn't really seem plausible when you stop to think about it, not even for a second. Watch the movie, and the secret in the basement shall be revealed.<br/><br/>""Don't Breathe"" was at best a mediocre delve in the horror / thriller genre. It offered nothing new, nor did it turn out to be a particularly memorable movie.

I love movies and this will never change for me, however, I'm getting sick of watching movies full of unlikable characters, especially in horror movies. This movie is also not an exception.<br/><br/>The only person I care about in this movie is Alex. He knows how risky robbery is unlike other selfish kids in the movie. If he screws it up, his father will be in trouble since he has access to all those houses because of spare keys and equipment that his father's security company manages. Other characters are a guy called ""Money"" who is like a gangster wannabe thug and a girl called Rocky. OK I get it. Everyone has a reason to become a burglar. Rocky has a terrible family background, no hope in her life blah blah Am I supposed to sympathize with her? Because she has an alcoholic/cokehead, promiscuous mother who sponges off her? Because she has an innocent little sister to look after? People have all kinds of problems and backgrounds in reality, but that doesn't justify robbery. This girl wants to take off to California to have a better life. To achieve that dream, she and Money don't even have a second thought about robbing a blind man's house. Do they deserve 300k? I don't think so. They are so selfish that they don't imagine what this blind man's life was or will be. He's lost his eyesight during war and then his daughter due to an unfortunate car accident, and now money on top of that? Give him a break. Oh wait, am I supposed to enjoy watching how this blind man delivers justice to these selfish kids? No no no, I don't expect something like that from this movie.<br/><br/>=====SPOILER===== Even when this blind man tried to make Rocky pregnant (although he is not a rapist), I didn't feel bad for her. Understand your own risk of trespassing someone's house. I felt bad when Rocky kicked him again and again instead. Sure he is a sick twisted man, but you're a burglar after all. She has no right to blame him. Nor does the woman who killed his daughter, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Rocky got what she wanted at the end over his friend's sacrifice. Do you enjoy life with the dirty money? I can't. I would have a nightmare every night. I would go insane. I wish that she paid for what she did. There is no catharsis in this movie, it rather leaves a bad after taste."

","Check out my reviews at http://moviereviews51.wordpress.com<br/><br/>This was a weird one for me that had an unsuspecting twist in it. I will not reveal spoilers as you will want to watch this one for yourself. Don't Breathe circles around 3 characters, Rocky (JANE LEVY, Evil Dead), Nick (DYLAN MINNETTE, Goosebumps) and Money (DANIEL ZOVATTO, It Follows), breaking into houses and steal just enough not to get noticed.<br/><br/>The fun begins when money gets a tip for a new house, an old army veteran (STEPHEN LANG,Avatar) who is blind. He had come into money after a settlement in court with a rich family whose daughter killed his daughter in a crash. Seems easy enough, stealing off a blind man, or is it!!!<br/><br/>Nick at first wants nothing to do with this job as there is too much money involved, all is explained in the film. The 3 watch the blind man's house, which is located in a deserted Street, he is the only resident left living there, if that isn't bad enough he also has a savage dog.<br/><br/>They decide to break in that night, knocking out the savage dog first, not everything goes to plan but they eventually get in. They start the search of the house looking for the money, Money makes his way up to the blind man's room and let's off a gas to keep him knocked out.<br/><br/>The three find a door well protected with a padlock that can't be broken. Money pulls out a gun that he decided to bring and this is when Nick decides he wants out and leaves. Money shoots the lock and manages to get it open. Before he gets the door open though the blind man appears. <br/><br/>Money tries to convince the blind man he was lost, the blind man walks towards him and stands on the broken padlock, this is when money pulls the gun on him. This is when the film gets going a bit, turns out the blind man isn't as easy as target as the three thought. After a scuffle together the gun is on money and he convinces the blind man he is the only one there, the blind man looks ready to let him go then BANG,one down two to go.<br/><br/>I will not reveal any more spoilers, after the gunshot nick went back into the house, as he does though the blind man seals the windows and padlocks the doors trapping him and Rocky in with him.<br/><br/>Nick finds Rocky, not before rocky finds out where the money eyes is hidden, they know there only way out is up through the storm cellar, which is located at the other side of the padlocked door which is now luckily enough open. The two manage to get through the door, which is when the blind man realises there is someone else in the house and that his money is gone.<br/><br/>It is from here the twists come as the two find something in the basement they really weren't expecting. Will they be able to escape this psychopaths house in one piece, if they do at all. With the dog awake they have both of them hunting them.<br/><br/>I will not say anymore regarding spoilers, it is up to you to get going to the cinema or wait for the DVD to find out how it ends.<br/><br/>The film does start off rather slow and boring. Stick with it though because it does get interesting, there are twists and turns and surprises.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film even of it is for the last 40 minutes of it. Stephen Lang does play a good bad guy and I really liked his performance in this, he was blind, strong and psychotic. If you haven't been to the cinema to see it then it is something to think about."
"anandrajeev979","8","1","4","15 October 2016"," A Fast Pace Spine chilling , terrifying and Tense Thriller (Perfect) told with great horror skills that will keep you at edge of your seat terrified
","We all have seen many breaking into house films but this one will be a classic in the genre.From the start only tension is build up and it only gets worse from then.As the events proceed shots are fired, hide and seek begins. Once some truths are revealed you will be confused to root for the old blind man or the teenagers looking to change their lives after robbing him. Even the dark scenes are intense and will make you nervous. It's an edge of seat experience. In my view I support the blind man as whatever he did he did right as against the injustice done against him and I am clearly against robbing a person especially retired old blind man. I was happy that the blind man strength was not superhuman but just little more than normal which is indeed required for a soldier. Cast has done a great job especially Stephen Lang and I love all the tension building scenes whenever anyone was in front of the blind man. The reveal near the end of the film is little creepy but it also shouts justice. All the scenes involving conflict and use of weapons kept me at edge of my seat. Final Word -This Movie does not waste any second to give you what it promise i.e. An Intense terrifying , thrilling ride filled with some horror for 1 and half hours. Easily best thriller of the year and among best thrillers of 2010s"
"belindaenthierry","Null","1","4","12 October 2016"," Suspense killed by violence
","Well, the story-line is brilliant, and that is half the work done on this horror/slash/thriller type of film. I was told it was less predictable than most. That's right, but it does not take a surprising turn like The Others does, or The Village. Just compared to Hammer House Horror maybe. It's a mix of horror and psychopath violence, and it tries to satisfy all audiences, except the ones who like a joke now and then. Too much bashing and thrashing to my mind, we would all be dead after one blow. And therein lies my objection to this otherwise well made movie: I need to believe it could be true, and I do not. Not after all those knives,pistols,garden tools and what-not. Less would have been be more, to my mind. The producer should have trusted the script more, and the acting, instead of relying on all that violence."
"n-kefala","8","1","4","6 October 2016"," Very entertaining horror
","'Don't Breathe' is an amazing and very entertaining horror film. A home invasion story that is artfully terrifying, atmospheric and claustrophobic. There are enough surprises and scares to keep everyone uncomfortable, and that's a very good thing. The movie is a nerve- racking thriller that doesn't stop coming at you until its final gasps. The director shows with this film his capacity of keeping up the excitement and suspense. If you're looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of the seat biting your nails, this is the one. The truth is that ""Don't Breathe"" gives a new breath to this season's horror movies and if you like the horror genre, this is for you. Oh, and... expect a sequel."
"rafael_jaramillo_avellan","7","1","4","1 October 2016"," 7.5/10 - A simple but thrilling movie with a perfect villain for a tense hour and a half.
","It's tension everywhere: Don't breathe delivers effective scares and thrills with a simple story and last-minute twists. The plot is nothing new in the home-invasion genre, but the story, characters and antagonist help to make it a pretty welcomed addition. There isn't much character development or background, but the precise information given about the protagonists and other flaws are more than compensated by the heavy atmosphere of the flick.<br/><br/>A wickedly written and perfectly casted villain makes this movie a satisfying journey. Stephen Lang is perfect in the role. What attracted me most from the character is the fact that he isn't a psychopath, not a madman, not a degenerate, he is a normal person (well, a very strong and meticulous ex-soldier). He is a father who suffered and takes justice into his own hands, without getting into traumatizing or pervert actions. One thing is for sure if he must be a mean son of a @#$%&, he will be the worst mean son of a @#$%&.<br/><br/>Something cool is the scary end of the movie (don't worry I won't spoil it), but I'll only say this: You will finish thirsty for a second part, saying ""Damn!!"". Asking yourself: ""What if...?"" ""Do you think that...?"" ""Holly @#$%&, will he...?""<br/><br/>FINAL CONSENSUS: The simple but thrilling storyline, protagonists, and main villain are highlighted by the tense and chilling atmosphere of the movie, making a worthy horror-packed hour and a half."

","Bad'uns, living in a run-down part of Michegan, dreaming of surfing in California – Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and loud-mouth Money (Daniel Zovatto) make a living from committing small time robberies. Smoking pot, using expletives and sex jokes in front of minors, including Rocky's little sister Diddy, the three ruffians decide to improve their shambling lives by robbing a house owned by blind war veteran Norman Nordstrom (Steven Lang) with $300,000 and a big, slobbering dog.<br/><br/>The money is compensation he received following the death of his daughter, who was run down by wealthy Cindy Roberts (Franciska Törőcsik). Nordstrom is devastated and bitter that she should be let off her crimes so lightly.<br/><br/>I love films that present a 'world within a world' - that is, an isolated utopia hidden in plain sight: Norman's home, which he rarely leaves (as established early on), is a dark sprawling private hell personalised to his needs and advantage. Outside, the sun shines and life continues. Inside, anything can happen, and no-one may ever know. When the three would-be robbers enter this world, it isn't long before one of them (Money, I'm glad to say) is despatched. For Rocky and Alex, trouble is only just beginning Scenes often begin with blurred shots or extreme close-ups that obfuscate the new perils the characters find themselves in, revealing every desperate detail with an agonising (and deliberate) slowness. Writer/Producer/Director Fede Alvarez is clearly a name to look out for. 'Evil Dead (2013)' composer Roque Baños's wonderful music score is exceptional also, a collection of moody, occasionally screeching instrumentation that really sells the growing unease. The discovery of Cindy Roberts, bound, gagged and pregnant, is shocking. She took away Norman's child, so he thinks it is only right she provides him with a new one. Except her death whilst trying to escape with Rocky, puts that idea to rest.<br/><br/>'There is nothing man cannot do once he accepts the fact there is no God,' says heavily armed Norman shortly before attempting to artificially inseminate Rocky using a turkey baster in a bid to replace once again, he hopes, his murdered child.<br/><br/>His plans foiled by Alex, and disorientated by the alarms, Norman fires randomly all around him, blowing a hole poignantly in a photograph of his daughter's smiling face.<br/><br/>I generally prefer independent horror films, often preferring them to bigger budgeted, more diluted mainstream offerings. This is hugely enjoyable, and very tense. There are no heroes, no-one without flaws, just wronged people. Someone online described 'Don't Breathe' as a heavily expanded variant of the Buffalo Bill segment of 'Silence of the Lambs (1991)', which is a pretty good synopsis. It is good to see this doing well in the commercial arena; I wish more managed to gain such attention."
"basilisksamuk","8","1","4","17 September 2016"," At last – a film that doesn't outstay its welcome or bombard with FX
","I seldom venture out to the theatre to see films anymore, not because I don't enjoy going but because there's seldom anything on I want to see. I'm not interested in films for children, chick flicks or films that have to go BOOM every two minutes. I used to enjoy superhero films but lately they are just an excuse for loud pointless fights and bad CGI.<br/><br/>The only reason I went to the cinema is that my wife had friends visiting and I wanted to keep out of their way (in the nicest possible way.) Don't Breathe was the only film showing at any of the local cinemas that was remotely of interest to me. I had no great expectations but I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>This is not a big budget movie and it depends heavily on the skill of the actors to engage the audience and on the skill of the film crew to make the most of claustrophobic spaces in the house where most of the action takes place. The plot is pretty thin but serves its purpose. The score is never overpowering and the effects do not look like they needed a Cray supercomputer (do they still exist?) to render crude visuals that take you out of the action. Oh yes, and at 88 minutes you can be assured the time is used to good effect and not just to add bloat.<br/><br/>A good efficient thriller with strong horror elements. Tense enough to keep you gripped and short enough not to let you dwell on the plot holes. Give me this any day over the tedious blockbusters that currently monopolise the cinemas."

As we keep iterating, horror is not defined by supernatural phenomenon or sudden loud noises. There were some surprises in the movie, some plot twists which made the movie really amusing. The essence of horror lies in a pervading sense of unsettling abnormality in the most normal of situations. It's crafted thriller movie, disguised as horror flick.

"mr_bickle_the_pickle","6","1","4","16 September 2016"," Pretty decent nothing revolutionary (Tried to keep this as spoiler free as possible)
","I had heard some good things about Don't Breathe and decided to check it out. Overall, I think its a good popcorn flick. There were some good tension and a good twist but it was also wrought with clichés and a stupid ending. One of the things I specifically liked was the direction. I liked how the camera moved around the house and focused on different items. For instance showing the audience early on where the gun was being hidden. It definitely added on another layer of tension because you would keep thinking things like ""Who's gonna get to the gun first?"". I think the movie also did a good job of making the main characters likable and wanting to root for them even though they are doing something bad in the first place (robbery). The cast did well with their roles. If I had to pick a standout I would go with Jane Levy. Now on to the stuff I didn't like. The ""aww shucks"" nice guy being in love with the main girl and she doesn't know it cliché. It's so overdone. And with Rocky's (Jane Levy) broken/abusive home life, I get its to bring sympathy to her character but it also feels contrived. Kind of like the lazy, easy way of getting sympathy. And then the ending.oh boy. I don't want to go in too much detail cause I'm trying to keep this as spoiler free as possible but, it just seemed to ignore a lot of details that happened earlier and therefore didn't make a whole of sense. If you're looking for a film that's going to flip the horror genre on its head, this isn't it. If you're looking for a quick thrill ride, then this would be up alley"
"Rendanlovell","6","1","4","16 September 2016"," Unnessarily over the top.
","From director Fede Alvarez comes his second feature film, 'Don't Breathe'. His first being the reboot of 'Evil Dead'. If there's one thing that a horror film can do for a director its shoot them into the limelight. Mainly because they are typically cheap to make and, like this one, don't require a complex narrative. It's more appealing to studio's and audiences eat it up. There has been quite a few gimmicky horror movies this year but this is for sure the best. Unlike those other films, this one looks great. It's easily the most cinematic horror movie I have seen in quite some time. Everything from the direction to the framing, color pallet, and the movement of the camera looked and worked incredibly well.<br/><br/>But the most important question to ask when you see a ""horror"" movie is, is it scary? While horror and comedy are especially subjective, I think I can easily say that this one just works. It's driven by thick atmosphere. This mainly has to do with both the look and the premise. Now, the story is very simple. Three kids decide to rob an old man after finding out that he has at least $300 thousand stashed in his house.<br/><br/>What they weren't expecting was that he isn't just a docile old blind man. It's a classic story about random people that get in over their heads and are slowly picked off. In fact, it reminded me of the slightly better 2016 film 'Green Room'. It actually follows the same story almost to a T as that film. But instead of the basic home invasion film that we see a whole lot, this one flips it around.<br/><br/>Instead, our main characters are the robbers rather than the people being robbed. The first thirty minutes of this film are nearly perfect. It sets up basic info about our characters, their robbing abilities, and demonstrates the brutality of the man the pick to rob. Not to mention the subtle hint that the old man may just be a victim in all of this. It could not have been a better set up.<br/><br/>Where it starts to falter is when it makes the old guy the villain. If it were to keep him and the main characters as murky human beings, this film would've worked extremely well. It would have transcended the basic us against them film. And it would've become a film where you aren't sure who to root for. But what we got is the two-dimensional horror flick everyone expected. <br/><br/>Even though it kind of turned into an unoriginal horror film, I still had hope. It was still very tense and simple enough to be fun, but it really derails near the middle. Where the villain becomes a B-grade comic book bad guy. With a completely unnecessary plot twist, the film turns this almost relatable old man into an utter psychopath for no reason. <br/><br/>It was from this point on that nearly everything became nonsense. Beforehand almost every scene felt like it belonged in the film. But after that point, almost every scene seemed to end with a question mark. Guns suddenly had infinite ammo until it was convenient not to, the old man suddenly had the magical power of teleportation, and spare keys were randomly hidden away in safes for some reason. <br/><br/>But the biggest issue with the film is that it had no idea when to end. There were two or three times where I swear it was going to end and it just didn't. There was a hilariously out of place and forced moment involving the old man and the main girl that lasted way too long. Then she managed to get out of that situation with the help of another dumb plot twist, then there was some running around, and then it just kind of ended.<br/><br/>It was like twenty minutes of the film but it felt like hours were going by because none of it felt like it belonged. It was really in the last half of the film where things started going off the rails. Everything before hand was very well executed and tense with some beautiful visuals to boot. But the latter portions of this movie just did not work for me. Really nothing felt like it connected to anything because it seemed designed to simply shock. That was it. It didn't want to be a film, it just wanted to shock its audience. But instead of building around that shock it just kind of threw it in there. Even though I respect this film and can give it a passing grade, it's not one I will ever see again."

I was literally barely breathing the whole time, together with my friend we were frustrated lol. It has a great cinematography and jump scares. I have a one minor problem about the ending.

"brankovranjkovic","7","1","4","14 September 2016"," As much a Thriller as it is a Horror
","I'm not a horror movie fan but this can also be considered a thriller, filled with tension and elements of horror. The film opens with 3 kids' (Rocky, Alex and Money) mid-robbery, unfortunately their loot isn't generating much cash so their fence suggests sealing just money instead. <br/><br/>They have a wonderfully simple idea, rob from a blind man who has just inherited a large sum of cash. Should be an easy steal – WRONG. The man also has a large, very vicious dog that features several times during the plot. Both the blind man and his dog build tension in equal measure.<br/><br/>They approach the house and drug the dog, it's important to know that everyone else in the street has moved out. However (once in the house) their plan quickly escalates into a home invasion, survival horror nightmare. Initially you'll find yourself feeling sorry for the innocent looking blind man until you realise he's a monster.<br/><br/>The kids become the hunted.<br/><br/>There were many times when I was holding my breath and on the edge of my seat, especially when the youngsters were sneaking past the blind man while trying to escape.<br/><br/>The musical score was very atmospheric (Perfect). The cinematography was dark and moody (Perfect). However, there are other aspects where the film is far from perfect with many holes in the plot, for instance  1/Why didn't the police find any evidence of Rocky's blood when they found the blind man? 2/Why didn't the police question the empty safe? 3/Why didn't the police find the 'female prisoner's' body or the torture room?<br/><br/>The film kept me on the edge of my seat, it doesn't rely on cheap 'jump scare' tactics either. The ending sets up nicely for a sequel, let's call it ... <br/><br/>""I Will Track You Down'.<br/><br/>Recommended for horror or thriller fans."

He has done anything wrong, people kept destroying his life and I felt sorry for him. He had lost his daughter and now he had a bunch of kids trying to steal his money.

"superdudeperkovic","8","1","4","11 September 2016"," The Film follows the event of a group of teens who attempt to rob a blind army vet
","Fede Alvarez's 2016 thriller film ""Don't Breathe"" is a simple but effective film that is void on dialogue but makes up for this with extremely well shot scenes and sound design that leads to a slow roll of dread for both the viewer and characters. The film has an extremely small cast consisting of about 5 characters, the highlights being Stephen Lang who plays the blind man in the film, films like these rely on the villain to be nerve racking and scary and Lang knocks this right out of the park with his depiction of the military vet turned harden blind man after his daughter is hit and killed by a car in an accident. The other characters in the film Jane Levy (Rocky), Dylan Minnette (Alex) and Daniel Zovatto (Money also play their characters well with the highlight being Rocky, Levy plays Rocky well as a strong independent woman who don't need no man who can take care and think for self, although she does rely on Alex several times throughout the film. The film does suffer in some area's such as in the lighting where during the scenes filmed in the dark there are many gun shot flashes that instantly hurt your eyes. The Film also steers away from greatness when you realise their is a very weak plot holding the movie together, the plot was mainly just there to give a reason for the blind man to hunt down teenagers. All in all I think the positives thoroughly out weigh the positives that's why i'm giving Don't Breathe a 8/10 and my own frozen semen seal of approval."
"jackson-regurge","8","1","4","9 September 2016"," A breath of fresh air!
","Don't breathe is a tense thrill ride of a film. It has been a long time since I have watched a thriller as good as Don't Breathe. Fede Alvarez's direction is inspired and also very watchable. Many films have patches of action followed by sections were nothing really happens, but Don't Breathe is a (if you pardon the pun) breath of fresh air. Throughout the entire film, I was on the edge of my seat desperate to see what happens next. Something I particularly noticed during the film was how silence is effectively used to create tension. This technique really helps this movie stand out as a great example of its genre. <br/><br/>Jane Levy's acting is superb as her utter fear is translated extremely well on screen. Stephen Lang delivers a hauntingly believable performance that will send shivers down your spine. <br/><br/>Overall, I think Don't Breathe deserves 8 out of 10 as it is a truly great film that goes back to the basics of cinema."
"kimheniadis","8","1","4","9 September 2016"," Real scares, wish it had less plot questions/problems, but still really liked it.
","It's been a long time since I've watched a movie that actually made me jump, and not because of cheap jump scares, although there were a couple of those too. As soon as the three friends entered the house, the tension did not let up. The theater I went to didn't have a huge audience, maybe 15 people, but it was so quiet in there, that you could tell they were also feeling the tension.<br/><br/>Besides the tension, the violence was pretty hard core too. People were not afraid to use guns, hammers, their fists, or anything else close by when it came to trying to defend themselves and get out of the house. Some movies go lighter on the violence when it comes to women, but this film didn't hold anything back. And normally when there is brutality towards an animal I close my eyes, cover my ears and hum to myself. Although I did do it once, the other times I was so engrossed in the movie I didn't have time to do those things, wanting to see what would happen next.<br/><br/>There were quite a few problems with the plot, especially towards the end, but I'm not even going to get into them, the rest of the movie was just so good. That problems were the reason this movie got four stars instead of five. Even with them, I highly recommend this movie. It wasn't as disturbing to me as the remake of The Hills Have Eyes remake, but it is one that with definitely stick in my mind."

","This is worth watching. Many predictable scenarios but good acting and directing make the movie worth while.Stephen Lang as the blind vet is excellent and Jane Levy's acting is upped by the use of facial expression .Movie had 9 mil budget and I remember Insidious with 1 mil scaring me more. One interesting fact is this director's style. No slant imaging or plating..he used the terror of a robbery and all parties trapped in the house to create his movie.The sound track was given high reviews in places; maybe I'm just spoiled by my recent viewing of ""It Follows"". Only as a reference to sound track will I tell you It Follows is in line with Jaws and John Carpenter's original Halloween as far as a sound track making the movie.The writer Fede Alverez and Rodo Sayagues deserve a mention as this was a well planned and building story line."
"CineMuseFilms","7","1","4","7 September 2016"," its all been done before but this one nails it for steadily escalating tension and sustained terror
","Two hallmarks of the horror-slasher genre are that we always take the victim's side and that we are cool with people dying multiple times. It's a genre that uses standard fear formulas like good and bad guys trapped in dark enclosed spaces, maybe a mad dog thrown in or an evil old man with awesome strength. The genre-bending Don't Breathe (2016) carves out new space by making everyone a victim and adding enough surprises and high-tension atmospherics to keep you stuck on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Three break-and-enter thugs decide to target the isolated home of a blind Army vet (Stephen Lang) to steal the big payout he received after the death of his daughter. The stereotypes are the usual mix: the gal who wants enough money to stop stealing, the guy who is scared of everything, and the psychotic one who we don't see for very long. The rest of the story is full of well-worn slasher tropes: the blind vet still has elite combat skills, the scared guy is always heading for the door, but the blond gal endures the worst. Like most horrors, males are dispatched quickly while women must endure prolonged helpless panic for the cinematic enjoyment of the male gaze. When all the doors are locked and the lights go out, it's a level playing field in the rambling old house that the blind man navigates by touch, smell and hearing. The basement is full of surprise and that darn dog has more combat tricks than you could imagine. In terms of plot, it has all been done before but this one nails it for steadily escalating tension and sustained terror.<br/><br/>There are enough genre innovations to make this film interesting but what really stands out is the filming, soundtrack and lighting. Nervy hand-held camera-work pokes into closets and runs down hallways, always capturing eyes fully dilated. The vet is the star actor while the thugs all over-act their parts, although there is minimal dialogue as whispers or breathing reveals where you are. Like all horrors, the lighting is scary low but when it switches to infra-red everyone is as blind as the vet while the soundtrack finds notes that tingle your brain. The cast are amazingly resilient as they are slashed for most of eighty-three minutes and recycling the not-quite-dead can be wearying. Although not a great fan of the genre, this one had my attention right up to its formulaic ending."
"quinimdb","7","1","4","4 September 2016"," Don't Breathe
","VERY MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD ""Don't Breathe"" is not only a description of what the characters were doing in the film, but what I was doing for pretty much the entirety of it.<br/><br/>The set up of the film is a perfect recipe for tension. Three kids in Detroit want to rob a rich blind veteran's house so they can leave Detroit for various reasons. One of the kids, Alex, robs because he doesn't want to be alone, since his father is often absent. He wants to be with Rocky, who is pretty much his only friend it seems. Also, his father is a cop, so it allows him to help out with the legal side of things to make sure they have minimal consequences if they are caught. Money robs because it's all he can do, and he seems to enjoy it. Rocky robs so that she can get enough money to leave her abusive mother and bring her little sister with her to California. They plan to rob a rich blind veteran, expecting it to be easy money that could finally allow them to leave Detroit. Except, in a clever twist on the home invasion genre, the robbers get trapped in with this psychopathic man who attempts to murder these kids by using only 4 of his 5 senses, and his dog.<br/><br/>Almost the whole film takes place in the man's small house, and the film feels very claustrophobic, using many extreme close ups and smart sound design to sustain tension. The tension in the film is mostly set up through an impressive long take which follows the characters as they silently traverse the house, checking every room silently, and establishing a sense of location, while also being a very intense scene in itself which culminates with a very tense final image. From here, the film doesn't let up, and trust me when I say that. The editing gets faster and faster, the encounters get closer, and the film could surprise you in ways you wouldn't expect. Let's just say that there's serious vulnerability of the characters in the film, and it makes each scene become more and more tense when you truly believe the characters could die at any moment.<br/><br/>Also, the film is very respectful of it's audience, unlike many modern horror films, and doesn't try to force feed you information. Much of the film is silent, but the shot choices and subtleties in the performances explain to us the how and why. It manages to build tension better than almost any film of the past 5 years, and has almost no jump scares, except for one genuinely unexpected one that is very effective, and I don't say that often about jump scares.<br/><br/>If there was one thing I could honestly say the film did wrong, it was it's opening shot. The opening shot shows the blind man dragging the woman by her hair down the street, and this was pretty much completely unnecessary. You could say it helps establish a vulnerability of the characters, but it does that pretty early on even without this shot. Also, this shot makes certain scenes preceding it much less tense than they should be, because we know exactly what is going to happen.<br/><br/>The acting is noticeably not very good towards the beginning, but once the tension begins the performances become pretty believable, with Steven Lang being the obvious stand out here. The characters also have no development throughout the entire film, but they don't need any development. It's a very tightly written film. Pretty much everything that the characters do make sense because of who they are, where they come from, and their motivations. I don't think I'don't ever watch it again, simply because all of the enjoyment of the film comes from not knowing what is going to happen next, but I'd say it's pretty much a perfect little self contained package with a perfect cliffhanger ending. It serves its purpose (which is to make you very tense) almost as well as it possibly can.<br/><br/>Finally, it's actually got a pretty good message: ""Some things in life you can't change, no matter how unfair they are"". In other words, you just have to tough some things out and continue on with your life, because there is truly nothing you could do about it (the lady bug is a good metaphor for this philosophy)."

","Don't Breathe seems like nothing more than a gimmicky premise parading around as an unique thriller. Luckily, it's more than that. Eschewing the uniquitous teeny-centric scare-fests we are so often bridled with, director Alvarez has sidestepped convention to give us a brutal genre picture full of ""What in the world?!"" surprises and jaw-dropping twists. Thanks to the strength in its accomplished direction and focused scope, Don't Breathe is a pull-no-punches, edge-of-your-seat nightmare. It's a reverse of the home-invasion story, like a slightly less compelling (although more purely plotted) version of 10 Cloverfield Lane: a group of burglars is terrorized by the homeowner, blind war veteran who is more than meets the eye. Alvrez's direction is unexpectedly strong, as the clever camera work and immense details pull us right in. In particular, the way a blind person may setup up their home is perfectly realized (empty rooms, backwards-facing TVs). On top of that, the fight scenes are well-staged and the sound editing mixed with the score beautifully manipulates the tension. The characters, unfortunately, are not as successful. The cool meta-element that speaks of film-going voyeurism gets a bit lost when the characters aren't quite engaging enough. A movie-personification of the axiom ""hurt people hurt people"", and Lang as the blind, pseudo-villain is the only real high-point as an effectively imposing and volatile presence. Otherwise, the motivations range from clichéd to weak, desperately needing more layers and better dialogue (again, see 10 Cloverfield Lane). Luckily, when you're deep inside this joylessly demented thriller, it's roller-coaster scares are the perfect post-summer escape at the theaters."

","Stephen Lang plays a very captivating antagonist in this 2016 Thriller, Don't Breath. At first, Stephen makes us feel remorse for his situation only to later makes us feel repulsed with his vengeance. The movie grew with suspense for hours, like a piece of gum you're blowing in your mouth, only to, well, never really burst. As much as the audience jumped, which was very seldom, the movie wasn't very scary. I never felt my heart pumping fast and I certainly wasn't on the edge of my seat. I was waiting and waiting for the twist. When it finally presented itself, it was like New Years Eve, you kinda just knew that the ball was going to drop, what a big surprise right? I want to make this clear, I'm not a hatter, I'm just a realest who loves movies. My friends think I expect to much, I don't, I just want to leave the theater satisfied, I was not. Stephen Lang was great and the plot had a ton of potential. However, I once again leave another movie in the summer of 2016 disappointed of what could be. I give Don't Breath a 5/10. All 5 coming from Stephen Lang. He can't do everything, but he can sure carry half the movie on his performance alone."

Not having any other residents around was a bit much for me. I guess it's a staple where the security guard or cop shows up in the middle and is sent away. But logic demanded that.<br/><br/>And was a bit confused why there was a million dollars instead of the $300,000. <br/><br/>But the cat and mouse was stellar. It didn't let up. I had to step back, though, and think how even a clever and strong blind man initially kidnapped the girl who killed his daughter. And the scenario of him impregnating her was horrific and original. And his initial anger at accidentally killing her was baffling. I didn't see the reveal coming. <br/><br/>I was disappointed in the director's reboot of Evil Dead in 2013. But this made up for it in spades. Being that it made a boatload of cash, I would assume it will have a sequel.

"ginocox-206-336968","8","1","5","19 November 2016"," A decent thriller that could have been better
","""Don't Breathe"" is a passable Monster-in-the-House thriller. It has grossed $152.5MM on a budget of $9.9MM and has garnered generally favorable reviews, so it's difficult to argue with success. <br/><br/>It has several strong elements. Stephen Lang delivers a strong performance. The setting is the creepiest dilapidated home I've seen in a movie since ""Silence of the Lambs,"" although I'm not a huge fan of horror films, so haven't seen that many. The lighting and cinematography are excellent. The film relies heavily on Steadicam shots, most of which are coupled with camera movements which are executed smoothly, so don't distract too greatly. Some shots are rock solid and the camera often seems to float effortlessly through space. But there some shots would have been improved if the camera were mounted on some sort of rigid support. <br/><br/>However, I had three issues with the film. <br/><br/>First, it lacked any eroticism or sexiness. A love triangle with a nerdish nice guy competing against a bad boy for a girl's affection propels the inciting incident, but the relationships seem tepid and better suited to some film from the Code Period. One scene that touches on sexual assault distances itself so thoroughly from any form of eroticism or nudity as to seem positively weird and not in a frightening or creepy manner. Perhaps the victim would be frightened, but the scene was so hopelessly contrived to avoid showing anything that it shattered my willful suspension of disbelief, preventing me from feeling any empathy for the character. <br/><br/>My second objection concerns dramatic structure. The basic paradigm for horror films involves a sinful act that unleashes a vengeful, often supernatural force that punishes the guilty, but often spares an innocent. To fit the paradigm, a character who didn't survive would have had to survive and a character who survived should have perished. Consequently, the film lacked a coherent moral. <br/><br/>Third, obvious evidence of offences and an individual's involvement are ignored. Eventually, outsiders attempt to understand what happened. All sorts of clues are left lying about that even Inspector Clouseau would notice and question, and yet they seem to be ignored. This seems to have been done to facilitate a sort of feel-good ending, but the ending doesn't quite feel good due to the second issue described above. <br/><br/>For me, these shortcomings prevented the film from having as great an emotional impact as it could have had."
"bob_meg","5","1","5","15 November 2016"," Don't Believe... oh sorry, I meant Don't Breathe
","Thrillers require a steadily escalating suspension of disbelief throughout. Once that spell is broken, all bets are off. I mean face it folks, most horror movies are essentially ludicrous. Most are chock full of convenient coincidences. Don't Breathe, however, Fede Alvarez's sophomore feature after his needless and uninspired remake of Evil Dead stands to break more than a few records in this arena, and not any to be proud of.<br/><br/>Look, Don't Breathe doesn't completely suck. It could have made a very cool short film. The main premise is three utterly unlikable wastes of space go for the score of a lifetime by targeting a solitary Gulf War vet in his creepy house in --- of course --- the middle of a huge apparently abandoned ghetto. The camera work is very John Carpenter, lots of nice low tracking shots that are very engrossing and fluid. <br/><br/>The film's main problems are the characters and the dialogue, which as in Evil Dead, borders on sub-literate. This does nothing to make us root for anyone but the ""bad guy"" whom the script tries to turn into an utter madman in the last third of the film with a series of ridiculous clichéd plot-twists and lifts from other psycho serial killer movies.<br/><br/>The scares are further sabotaged by one of the ""heros"" (ha ha) who seems to have more lives than Michael Myers in the entire Halloween franchise and many other yes... plot holes. There are so many plot holes in fact, that you can go to Rotten Tomatoes and find that same complaint among almost all of the negative reviews, of which there are shockingly few, although I think most of the ""positive"" reviews are really only so-so, as mine is. It's also a bad sign when most of the message board posts are either ""WTF?"" or legions of horror fanboys defending one of the few horror entries this year that doesn't outright stink. <br/><br/>The fact is that the general standards for horror are becoming as sloppy as many things are in our world today. You deliver one or two scares... you try for that C- and you're done, right? Sorry, it doesn't cut it for a full-length feature."

","I'll be honest, I was uber stoked when I first saw Stephen Lang and his normal badassery on the trailer for Don't Breathe, however I remained skeptical about the full movie, because the story has been done a ton of times and a tun more after the first ones. Fede Alvarez and the cast all worked some seriously impressive magic to not only make me feel silly about my initial assumption, but to go hard as they managed to work that same magic throughout the full 128 minutes <br/><br/>Not only did the home invaders(Levy, Minnette, and Zovatto) all do impeccable jobs at actually portraying that they were being terrorized, Stephen Lang blew my mind with his role as he transformed into a seemingly innocent blind man who just so happened to end up becoming the target of a robbery at the hands of three hoodlums, into a seriously bad ass butt kicking blind man that as it turns out might end up being the source of a much bigger problem, himself! The movie is exactly what one would expect coming from a director/writer who has probably been sitting on this movie ever since the release of the Evil Dead remake that he had also directed. I tip my hat to the whole cast and crew of Don't Breathe, but I have to pay a much greater respect to both Fede Alvarez for the brilliant job he did with putting such a legit psychological thriller onto the big screen, and to Stephen Lang for being able to give me a horror movie character that's not a monster that actually freaked me out."
"DannyDnB","6","1","5","18 October 2016"," Chillingly tense.
","This is a movie that tries to rely on simplicity rather than going into more complicated territory, and it uses the simplicity to try and stir the more natural fears we ALL share. Does it accomplish this? Absolutely!<br/><br/>From the get go we as viewers know that the story is about a trio of house burglars who find out that an army vet has a lot of money stashed away in his old and rusty house in a very quiet street, the catch is that the man in blind. <br/><br/>The film sets up its characters well enough, particularly the character of Rocky played by the very camera-friendly Jane Levy. We see a glimpse into their lives and what it is that drives them into the house in the first place. I liked this about the movie, but I found myself wanting to see more of the other two as well, and unfortunately we don't get that. <br/><br/>The character of The Blind Man is also handled well, perhaps more so than the rest of the cast. Stephen Lang does a fantastic job of portraying this surprisingly complex character. The greatness comes with the slow but steady transformation of our viewpoint of the man, and it is a haunting transformation to say the least.<br/><br/>The other strong points of this movie are particularly the well thought out screenplay as well as the sleek cinematography. I am dead serious when I say that this is a genuinely well produced horror/thriller film. The minimalist soundtrack rounds this all off with great style.<br/><br/>Now, with all of the positives out of the way, I do need to point out some of the places where the movie doesn't succeed, because, trust me, there are a few of them.<br/><br/>The film kicks off with a real strong start, and for the first hour it is almost flawless, however, later in the film the whole thing starts getting a bit much. We are pulverized with twists and turns that sometimes feel like they don't really need to be there, and these actually make the movie drag on a bit when it feels like it should have already reached its climax. The movie then drags on even more in the last ten minutes and by then I had seen enough of the same thing for it to not be quite as exciting as it was in the beginning.<br/><br/>The other big problem with this movie is the plot holes. I'm not going to say that there are many of them, but the ones that are there do stand out when you stop to think about them. <br/><br/>This is a very chillingly tense movie that was handled with enough care for it to stand out as one of the finest horror films of the year. I was sitting at the edge of my seat for the majority of the film, and it is so originally simplistic in its approach that it ends up delivering a surprisingly scary experience."

","It's hard to explain in a few words just what this movie is about. A blind man is robbed by 3 teens for the settlement he won when his daughter died.<br/><br/>We are shown early on the motives for the thieves and one can sympathise with them quite easily as Rocky *Spoiler alert* comes from a broken home and wants to run away with her sister. Yes, 'her'. Stephen Lang's character 'The Blind Man' is a blind gulf war veteran who is trying to live a quiet life and simultaneously seek revenge on his daughters killer. It is therefore easy enough to sympathise with both characters.<br/><br/>Personally I disliked the ending as I really badly wanted the good guy to actually win in this one as I think The Blind Man is the true hero ;). Anyway the ending at least did not disappoint story- wise and the film left me gobsmacked in many areas (The basement).<br/><br/>I highly recommend any lover of Thrillers about sympathetic 'villains' to watch it as you will not be disappointed!"

","There are people saying that 'Don't Breath' is the best horror in years, and honestly it almost was. However one thing knocked the film down. From all the tension, and smart camera-work, and brilliant directing, one thing angered me so much that I almost walked out of the film three times towards the end of the film. <br/><br/>I did not care for Rocky aka the main protagonist of this story. Now it doesn't matter if your a horror, drama or action film, we need to care about our main character. There are three burglars, and the only likable one, is someone you know from the opening shot, is not going to be alive at the end. I won't spoil how, but from the beginning you know only Rocky will be left at the end. <br/><br/>Granted they give her a valid motivation, but I need more than a text message, and a two minute rushed scene with her daughter, to make me care and accept everything she does. The actress Jane Levy who plays her does a great job, but the way the character and story is written just ruined any care I had by the end of the film. This character goes full 80's Hollywood horror logic, and the selfish attitude, made me root for Stephen Lang's psychotic blind man character by the end, and there's a twist about that character that makes me feel sick knowing I wanted him to win even after the fact. Like Jesus Christ why can't horror characters ever at least knock out a human antagonist in this film. The character was selfish, stupid and not very fleshed out. <br/><br/>That aside. This was a fantastic horror movie. No false scares. Stephen Lang was intimidating as hell. The pacing was nice. The twists were disturbing. There was well built up tension. <br/><br/>That scene that in the trailer when everything's shot in night vision, is one of the most tense things I have ever seen, and was genuinely frightening. Alex played by Dylan Minnette, is the real likable character in this story, he fights, he isn't selfish, he steps up to the plate and is played brilliantly by Dylan. If he was the main character, I would have been on board until the end.<br/><br/>The sound design and cinematography were exactly what we need from a horror. It takes the show whats supposed to be scaring us approach and it works. Instead of a loud sound effect of bit of music making the audience jump every time the blind man suddenly appears, they let the lack of noise, or simply the sound of the door being slammed open when he enters do all the scaring. We see the blind man show up, and we as an audience freeze as soon as the characters do. This is the best sound design in a horror since 'The Babadook' that's how good the sound design is. All these long shots establishing the space and where everything is in the house, should be commended. Its great story telling, Hollywood has finally learned how to make a good horror movie.<br/><br/>This film could easily be a 4.5/5 had it not been for the unlike-able, generically stupid clique lead. Last few years we have seen 'The Conjuring 1 and 2', 'The Babadook' and 'Light's out' all being competent good horror movies, and none angered me because I cared about the characters.Thats why the character of Rocky, while played brilliantly, was just written so a bad that the anger it produced and the lack of care I had for the final 20 minutes, knocks this film down to just above the average just a movie rating <br/><br/>3.5/5 Stars"

Writer/director Fede Alvarez then has the audacity to ask his audience to give a damn about what happens to this trio of white trash scum-bags.<br/><br/>Not on your nelly!<br/><br/>I don't care how rotten an upbringing Rocky has had, or that she cares for her little sister, or that the blind man turns out to be far from helpless and more than a little bit twisted - rooting for Rocky and her thieving pals is not an option, making the film a frustrating experience from the outset.<br/><br/>But unlikable protagonists aren't my only issue with Don't Breathe: there's the small issue of the blind man (played by Stephen Lang), who makes Zatoichi and Daredevil look like clumsy buffoons by comparison. Some of the things this sightless guy is able to do are utterly ridiculous: disarming a gun-toting enemy, repeatedly turning up at the right place at the right time, abducting a woman and keeping her in a basement prison (which, presumably, he also constructed), reaching up to yank Rocky from air ducting, and silently tracking his victim in the surrounding derelict neighbourhood, all without stubbing a toe. His guard dog also displays supercanine qualities, the hound even climbing up furniture and entering an air vent to pursue Rocky.<br/><br/>Alvarez manages a couple of effective jump scares along the way, and delivers a memorably yucky scene involving a turkey baster and a large helping of 'gentleman's relish', but the movie is, for the most part, way too dumb and loaded with implausibilities and glaring plot holes to be good for anything but unintentional laughs."

","Directed by Fede Álvarez (the same guy who gave us the Evil Dead remake), this film tells the story about a group of three young burglars who make a living out selling the items they stole. It is right up until they come across a house that is owned by an old blind man, giving one of them second thoughts. The decision is made, however, as all three of them go for it. Assuming that he is asleep, they snoop around looking for the safe. But all hell breaks loose, as the blind man finally wakes up and shoots the group-leader dead. This leaves the two remaining burglars to survive and look for one or more ways to escape.<br/><br/>I'll start, of course, with the cast and characters: Jane Levy (also starring in the Evil Dead remake) plays Rocky, a young-adult woman living with her little sister and her drug-addicted mother; her goal in life is to move to California with her sister. Next, we have Dylan Minnette as Alex, who seems as the most intelligent in the group. Up next, we have the mastermind, I kid you not, Money, played by Daniel Zovatto (whom I didn't even recognize until reading his bio on Wikipedia; he played one of the boyfriends in It Follows). And last, but certainly not least, we have Stephen Lang as the Blind Man, a veteran who apparently lost his sight in the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch, especially by Jane Levy, as well as Dylan Minnette. But most importunately, Lang is the one who steals the show. He gives the best performance that I have ever seen from him. At first, he seems like a regular old blind guy; but as it turns out, he is a raging psychopath.<br/><br/>Each and every scene in this film keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen at the word go, because it sure had me at the edge of my bed.

I just toured America's Motor City during the ""Woodward Dream Cruise,"" and enjoyed a steady stream of Detroit's GTO's, Corvettes, Mustangs, and Chargers roaring by. Sony shows the turkey-basted mother-to-be ""Rocky"" driving in something like a Hungarian Yugo, that cannot even keep the dogs out. These mendacious propagandists also slander our Undefeated U.S. Army heroes, depicting them as Ticking Time Bomb Serial Killers. It pictures a squalid Detroit beset with WHITE-ON-WHITE crime (which smacks of Hungary to me). Unless you're a total Masochist, do NOT pay Sony for any more of its Racist, Anti-American Malarkey!"

","This is certainly one fantastic thriller, a very original home invasion movie that's very tense and lots of fun and gripping throughout its running time, this movie is described in some reviews as a horror film but its really not, its horrific maybe as a thriller but not a straight up horror, there's no supernatural elements here. The movie is also described as having the best twist in years but that's overhyping just a tad I think as there is not so much a twist that makes you say wow I didn't see that coming its just a twisted story, none the less its a very well directed movie, very nice looking sets and locations, very well acted by a great cast and a tense soundtrack, if you like scares and jumps and nail-biting movies this is certainly for you, its not blood and guts. A must see thriller that's very well made and wont be forgotten for a while."
"daretostruggledaretowin","5","1","8","5 September 2016"," When Men Try Too Hard to Make Feminist Films
","I recently saw Don't Breathe (2016) and immediately had some opinions on it. The writers/directors are Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, the men behind the bastardized Evil Dead remake. Don't Breate came off as a film directed by men that tried too hard to be a feminist film. Instead of an emancipatory message for women who resist patriarchy, the heroine is met by disappointment, especially when men whose characters are straight from the ""damsel in distress"" genre of medieval legends. She cannot count on men to save her, however, so it is up to her to discover her own method of escape, but in the end her oppressor and captor gets away because of a patriarchal, and preferential to military veterans, justice system.<br/><br/>I do, of course, get the irony of me, a man, criticizing a film made by men for not being feminist enough. However, truly feminist cinema, as I have written about before, is that which is written from the female gaze and offers a genuine critique of patriarchy that offers a method for liberation. Basically, Don't Breathe tries too hard and fails at being a feminist film."

","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife skipped.<br/><br/>I was drawn to it mainly for Jane Levy, mostly a TV actress in such series as ""Suburgatory"" starting in 2011 and more recently in ""Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist"" starting recently and now running. In ""Don't Breathe"" she was about 26 during its production.<br/><br/>I also found out she is a former soccer player so in a scene where she is required to run full-speed out of a house and down the street her running looks quite authentic.<br/><br/>Anyway these three Detroit 20-something friends, two guys and a girl, are petty criminals, they break into homes and steal whatever they can fence. Detroit is not what it used to be, the girl has a terrible mom and wants to get away, to California maybe, and take her little sister with her for a better life.<br/><br/>They find out about a man who lives alone, a military veteran, he was blinded, and in a case some years back was awarded a big settlement, ""six figures."" So the three decide, without any evidence, that the man must keep his loot inside his house in a dilapidated area of the city and they will go at night to steal it all.<br/><br/>So these three are not very good young people, plus they are not very smart. What could go wrong when the man also has a vicious Rottweiler with him at all times? So it plays out at night with some interesting scenes and an interesting development with the blind man, but overall it is just a mediocre movie. And it ends with the girl and her little sister headed to California, seemingly with no consequences for all the carnage we witness.<br/><br/>Still I am glad I took the time, Jane Levy is cute and is a capable actress."

Effective home invasion/horror movie. It's well acted, has great cinematography, suspenseful and is very violent. But if is far from perfect. For a start, who are we meant to root for? Who is the victim here? Thieves versus crazy psycho. This dilemma bothered me throughout, and I can't say that I was pleased with the ending (not giving it away!). As mentioned our robbery victim is blind yet he is able to carry out tasks that just simply would not possible by himself. And another thing that really annoyed me was one of the robbers, a slightly built young man, endures multiple beatings and injuries yet he appears to possess amazing recovery powers!

"imnosferatu","9","0","1","2 December 2019"," Don't Breathe by I.M. Nosferatu #Nosferreview
","Despite the title, you can breathe - I saw Don't Breathe and I'm telling you that you can take a deep breath. Don't get me wrong, it didn't suck. In fact, it was quite good as a genre piece. I'd even say that the set up and first forty-five minutes were Ripper smooth and reached a level just below Krugerian in nature. Indeed, the basic plot was somewhat unique and obviously a primary factor in leading to an 85% audience score on ""Rotten Tomatoes.""<br/><br/>It's the old Robin Hood story with a couple of Hitch twists. Three delinquents break into houses and steal valuables from the rich to sell to their slimy fence. The fence comes up with an easy mark for the post-pubescent robber-barons. It seems a former veteran's daughter was killed in a car accident and the veteran received a million dollar settlement. Why anyone would think that the vet would keep the money in his house stretches credibility? But okay, I'll bite. Oh, I forgot to mention, the vet is blind and lives in a hovel with a dog that could have played Cujo. So the deed goes down and our Robin Hoods manage to break into the house, quell Cujo, and sedate the blind man - or do they? That is the million dollar question. The tables quickly turn and like the film Extremities, the questions of who is captor and who is prey become muddy at best.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons why this film succeeds is the sick acting. Veteran character actor Stephen Lang, who has a resume longer than the river Styx, rises to the level of Jasonian in terms of his acting. He came to prominence for most mortals as Colonel Miles Quaritch in Avatar (he also was the voice of the same character in the video game). But I remember his stunningly ill performance as Ike Clanton in 1993's Tombstone about Wyatt Earp (the one with Kurt Russell, not Kevin Costner). Jane Levy is devilishly good as Rocky, the female bandito of the group with a heart of gold (she wants the money so she can save her young sister from her demented mother). Seriously sick performances also are turned in by Dylan Minnette as Alex (from Goosebumps) and Daniel Zovatto as Money (from Fear the Walking Dead). Special fang bites (real ones in this case) go to the Dog who apparently was played by three different canines - Astor, Athos & Nomad.<br/><br/>The film was penned by Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues and more than capably directed by Mr. Alvarez. No stranger to the horror genre, Mr. Alvarez has amassed such horror credits as the 2013 Evil Dead and the 2009 Panic Attack. He knows how to give good scare.<br/><br/>As I said, the set-up was Ripper smooth. After forty-five minutes, however, the film falls into general horror formulaic patterns (which isn't a bad thing for genre fans). I should note that there is one part that jumps the shark so badly that even Darth Vader (Lord of shark jumping) would cringe under his oxygen mask. But overall, the story moves briskly to its predictable but satisfying ending. Wish I could say more, but spoilers aren't my thing.<br/><br/>The boffo box office and almost unanimous acceptance by both audiences and critics alike has to be due to the slick marketing scheme offered by the marketing wizards. There's no doubt that Don't Breathe is a sick horror film worthy of multiple fangs-for-the-memories - but 85% on the tomato meter? Most horror films don't break 50%. And that's because from the looks and plot summary it appears - at least on the surface - that it's a psychological suspense thriller as opposed to purely a horror offering. So it's a fake left go right, or to use an advertising analogy, a bait and switch. Muggles are attracted to the film thinking it's more of a mainstream piece and then get sucked into the horror genre vortex. Probably most of these types are so virginal that they don't even realize they are watching standard horror fare.<br/><br/>At any rate, I deem it a horrifically well-made film worthy of viewing by both genre fans and the uninitiated. I give it my I.M. Nosferatu Medal of Honor. From its reception, I am certain that more breath will be pumped into Don't Breathe sequels."

","The best things about this movie are the acting and the pacing. Three characters, one female and two males, decide to rob a blind man. I seem to remember that the blind man had been in the military years before but I'm not positive on that. The blind man became a total recluse after his daughter was killed and there are rumors that he has a bunch of money in his home somewhere. The thieves think they can just knock him out with some kind of gas and take the money easily. They're obviously very wrong. Unlike some other reviewers, I don't feel like we're supposed to like or root for the thieves all that much. The female character maybe, but even then only somewhat in the beginning to make us care about what happens to her later on. This made it better for me because I was on the blind man's side throughout the movie until the reveal that he was keeping a woman prisoner because he blamed her for his daughter's death. I loved that reveal because it changed my opinion so quickly and I wasn't expecting it at all. I could have done without the blind man trying to impregnate the woman and later the thief but I appreciate that he wasn't literally raping anyone because that wouldn't have fit with his character at all. Also, I loved the scenes with the dog in the car and I appreciate that the dog wasn't killed."

","Introducing a creative new thriller/horror of 2016! Our film is about 3 thieves and their newly selected victim. The trio of thieves choose to break into a house during the night, having chosen the house of a blind man. The man also lives alone. Their goal is to rob him of his large fortune, however, their new mystery victim (aka the blind man) isn't as helpless as they all assumed.<br/><br/>One of the best highlights from this film is it doesn't require a great deal of story or information in order to get the film going. Within a matter of minutes we are introduced to our 3 thieves (with brief stories where required) and then boom, we are taken straight into a very dark thrill ride. While films like this cannot elicit much discussion on my behalf (due to spoilers ), I will suggest when viewing this film to simply watch it with your lights turned off and be generous with your surround sound system. The film only has a small fist full of actors, but when it comes to sound mixing, in this film you really notice every bit of detail coming from the victim's home- floor creaking, glass breaking, guns firing, tools dropping- it's all here and the house sounds alive.<br/><br/>Actor Stephen Lang plays 'The Blind Man'. While I'm very familiar with his acting career, he is mostly known as the lead villain in 2009's Avatar (or a couple of B Graded films in the past). This was a new take for this actor. At times it didn't even require him to speak in the film and he provided a strong presence on screen.<br/><br/>Director Fede Alvarez, I'll admit, is new to me, unless you're personally a fan of the new remake of Evil Dead 2013 where he also worked with Sam Raimi by his side as one of the producers. The two of them work together again in this film, and their style was new to me. This film is very dark, gritty and aims to make the audience squirm. The director is taking full advantage of all aspects that can be used.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe is something I enjoyed a lot, mostly due to its creativity but also because of how much it surprised me- it wasn't a predictable film (unlike many of the horror films in 2016). Just when I thought something frighting was over, I would find myself wrong and it is a great, fun thrill. Don't Breathe is highly recommend for horror and thriller fans. Well that's if you dare to watch it, lol.<br/><br/>8.5/10

","Wow very intense movie. I actually thought I was there in ten house. I just couldn't keep my eyes of my TV screen."
"nitzanhavoc","6","0","1","2 January 2019"," Cheap and unpolished, still suspenseful and entertaining.
","For honesty and coherence's sake I'll start off by saying I gave Don't Breathe a 6 out of 10. It's compelling, keeps you on edge and at times truly shocking without allowing itself to be pulled into anything too cliché. Pretty much all the makings of a decent modern Horror film not dealing with the supernatural, definitely achieving its initially set goals both story-wise and cinema-wise.<br/><br/>Having said that, the film is (in my humble opinion of course, feel more than free to disagree) quite frankly cheap and enjoyable despite it, not due to it. First, the cheap psychological trick of presenting the villains (no, they are NOT anti-heroes, simply a bunch of misfit delinquents forming a street gang of egotistical spoiled brats) as the protagonists from the exposition to the very end. Three jerks who decide to break into a war veteran and bereaved father in order to rob him of his settlement funds (his sole livelihood), and the audience is coerced into sympathizing with them on account of the female coming from a messed up home with an abusing mother and the male being a slightly dorky ""good guy"" in love with her. The screen time they are given achieved the effect of making us (or me at least) secretly (or not quite so) root for them despite them being the obvious bad guys from the get go.<br/><br/>Second, the fear and shock factors are as cheap as they come. Jump scares as the only truly ""frightening"" feature. Dark secrets revealed which flip the script and imply that there are no good guys in this film (so much for the film avoiding clichés). And my favorite - the ""antagonist"" (again, a 50+ year old veteran protecting his house and wealth from a bunch of no good would be burglars) being a hybrid of Superman and God, easily able to overpower a youngster half his age and twice his size, survive two hammer swings hitting him straight on the back of the head and escape handcuffs. Perhaps this was a supernatural Horror film after all.<br/><br/>Third, the sheer stupidity of certain scenes for the sake of the plot instead of choosing one of a million other more authentic and realistic options. Like the war veteran suddenly losing his accuracy and missing the kid he tries stabbing with garden shears when he's literally on top of him, moments after he was able to track said kid using his hearing alone and hit him with a pistol bullet form the other end of the hall. The bullet of course didn't kill the kid, as that would have made far too much sense. That's not just foolish, it's cheating.<br/><br/>Yes, the film is fun to watch even if you aren't able to ignore all those blunt shortcomings. It's suspenseful and keeps you guessing and hoping. Some scenes are truly shocking regardless of being cheap and overall result is definitely worth watching. Just please don't be fooled by the relatively high score Don't Breathe has received here on IMDB (yes, that's pretty high, people here get a kick out of trashing excellent Horror films) and don't expect 2016's Horror masterpiece. Aside from the great acting nothing about this film should have been as it was, and it wouldn't have been all that challenging to make it better or at least less cheap."

","Over the past few decades, we have been blessed with a selection gripping, psychological and some damn right nauseating films from the horror sub-genre, home invasion. Don't Breathe is another film added to the long list, but sadly doesn't give us the same thrill as many others. However, Don't Breathe shouldn't be disregarded and at best is a good suspense thriller with a dark secret to be revealed towards the end. Three reckless teenagers make their living by robbing peopl's homes and when they realize a blind veteran has moved into a house on an abandoned street, they seize their opportunity. After realizing he has hundreds of thousands of dollars. Although the man is blind and grieving the loss of his daughter, he is by no means an easy target. With a house so bolted up, when the feral trio find an entrance, they sure as hell will struggle to find an exit.
A few scares here and there, a little bit of gore and some suspense make it watchable, but it is not something I would rant home about. Films such as The Strangers and Funny Games set such a high standard for home invasion it is hard to top such quality."

So if anybody should have got that money it should have been the Rocky. And again none of them had no business breaking into a anybody's house, yet along a blind man's house, who you assume has a settlement from losing this only kid. No sympathy from these brats from me.

"ssbbdude","6","0","1","26 October 2018"," Middling Horror/Suspense that got too grim
","Don't Breath began very well! And actually, up until the third act, was a creepy, suspenseful, unconventional horror movie. But the last 20-25 minutes became a bit too nasty for me. It had been dark and gruesome up to that point, but in the way that's enjoyable. But in the final third (spoilers ahead) the Blind Man decided to impregnate the main girl by hooking her up to a restraint system, putting some of his sperm in a syringe, and inserting it into her rear end. This could have been a great suspense horror if they had kept to the premise of avoiding the blind man as he stalks them though the house. But as is, it got too needlessly unpleasant for the premise it began with.
Also, this is just a personal feeling, but a part of me still felt bad watching this old army man scream in fear and pain at the end when the alarm was going off and he couldn't gather his surroundings. I know hes a horrid man, but seeing an old blind army vet man scream, squirm, and cry in pain and confusion was not something i signed up for.
Overall, a middling movie that could have been way worse...but could have been way better."

","A trio of burglars, Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto, break into a blind veteran's remote home, the great Stephen Lang, to steal a recent large legal settlement. The young burglars get more than they planned for when they instead find themselves the trapped inside the home and stalked by Lange. The fact that Lang's character cannot see and the burglars cannot speak for fear he'll hear them and kill them makes it so a majority of the films done wordlessly and in complete silence. These sorts of movie set-ups are what I consider ""pure cinema,"" telling a story on film that could not be told in another medium. Not as a book not as a comic, not as a play, or not in any other storytelling format. ""Don't Breathe"" builds suspense with visuals and sound in a way that would not transfer to another medium. Now the set-up is not all that clever or original (I supposed you could say it's ""Wait Until Dark"" turned on it's head), but director Fede Alvarez, who'd previously directed the surprisingly strong ""Evil Dead"" remake, builds tension like a master and has crafted a wicked little suspense thriller. In contrast to his ""Evil Dead"" remake, this film steers away from blood and gore and instead focuses on suspense, creating a situation where the audience can't help but ask themselves, what would they do in this situation? Credit for this also goes to a strong script co-written by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, which the best of these sorts of films have the characters have the characters take the logical actions the audience would do in that same situation. It's like the classic haunted house story question. Why don't the characters just leave? The script for ""Don't Breath"" does a great job of exhausting all of the logical options you'd think the burglars would do to try to escape (cell phones, guns, windows, door locks, basement exits, etc.). The story does seem to overly rely on horror movie tropes than I would have liked (torture, the-last-girl, night vision, etc..), but it's all done so well that horror movie aficionados won't care. Produced by Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert, with an fine score by Roque BaÃ±os, ""Don't Breath"" is a must see for horror fans!"

","I caught this one on one of the movie channels. This is a well directed and played movie. I would place it in the horror/mystery category with the emphasis on horror. It uses the time honored device of buildup, buildup, release then impact to shock the audience. It is well worth seeing for horror fans. This is also an example of how when a story idea is shopped around 'Hollywood' that the general idea is used in more than one movie. Being as ""Intruders"" and ""Don't Breathe"" were released a year apart, I won't speculate on who came first in the story concept. This one is more horror while ""Intruders"" is more mystery/suspense. Both feature outstanding performances by the female lead and somewhat vague endings. Both feature similar but not matching situations. I was impressed by this movie but enjoyed ""Intruders"" more just because I don't need my heart rate increased by horror movies so much anymore. If I could state a one sentence comparison: ""Intruders"" is smarter while ""Don't Breathe"" scarier. Stephen Lang delivers another great performance. For horror fans it deserves 10 stars but for me it gets 8 because it is too scary for an old codger like me. Lang and Levy both deserve 10s."

"Mike_Devine","7","0","1","15 April 2018"," Proof that thrillers can be developed on the cheap
","The emergence of indie suspense-thrillers/horrors in the past few years has not gone unnoticed. And while Blumhouse Productions has virtually owned this genre of late, Screen Gems/Ghost House Pictures had a monster hit with 2016's low-budget 'Don't Breathe.'<br/><br/>The premise is simple enough - three young burglars in the metro Detroit area decide to break into a decrepit home of a blind war veteran to steal $300K he was awarded in a settlement following the death of his daughter. What could go wrong here? Well, let's start with the fact that said blind man (Stephen Lang) has basically turned into a dog with a heightened sense of hearing and smell. Of course, things don't start out well for the three bandits (Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto) and they don't get any better as things progress.<br/><br/>The reason why 'Breathe' works is because it's so raw and it doesn't try to be some grandiose spectacle. The success of the film relies on the small cast, the setting (i.e., the house) and sound - or lack thereof. These basic elements are enough to captivate audiences when done correctly, and that's why 'Breathe' is what it is. There are enough scenes where you are on the edge of your seat because you know what will likely happen, but it's just a matter of how it will happen. The best part is, a lot of what's expected either doesn't materialize or the plot is a winding road that takes a while for things to actually play out.<br/><br/>Sure, there are some part of 'Breathe' that feel a bit cliche. The foreshadowing/harkening back to moments noted earlier in the film, particularly those relevant to Rocky - the female bandit who is motivated to seek a better life for her and her little sister - are blatant and can be seen from a mile away. There are also plenty of ""Seriously?"" moments that just seem ridiculous, but that's also what makes this film so interesting.<br/><br/>'Don't Breathe' is proof that you don't need millions upon millions of dollars to create something edgy, smart and thrilling."

","Thrilling and utterly entertaining. The biggest, and arguably the only stupid mistake made by any of those kids was Money shooting at the lock, however, they needed to get that lock open, and whatever method they were going to use - short of liquid nitrogen - was probably always going to be loud.<br/><br/>From there, the movie proceeds quite competently, and of course Don't Breathe is the type of movie where that is the make or break. Money, Rocky and Alex go in house. Alex decides it's too dangerous and leaves. Blind Man kills Money. Rocky is understandably in shock. Alex comes back because he heard the shot and wants to protect Rocky. Once back in the house, Alex enters a situation that's already running at full speed. From there, these two kids, these inexperienced and scared out of their mind kids, are up against a veteran on his own turf... Plus, that damn dog.<br/><br/>Rocky stole the money because, why not? That is the mission and you might as well. Sure, Money is dead, but, you're already in the situation, so, you make the best of it. Rocky needs that money, so they can't call the cops. So, it makes sense to try and escape, then call in an anonymous tip later. The Blind Man knows that house like the back of his hand, so, him keeping them hostage was very believable.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe is a film of antiheroes and anti-villains, and that is what keeps it fresh. Nobody in this movie is all good, but they all, (except Money hence his death) have motives worth looking in to. 7/10."

","Difficult one for me to evaluate. I'm sure it does everything the makers intended and that for some this is one rocking good non-stop action movie. I watched the much earlier, Five Dolls For an August Moon (Mario Bava) the night before and in truth that is very much a case of style over substance. It looks great all the time but while there is violence, most of this is off screen and almost incidental. With Don't Breathe, the action is everything. It is very well done but just how many times does someone get beaten to death and not be dead? It is a simple tale that could be told in five minutes but is drawn out like some interminable boxing match. It is interesting that this has a modest 15 certificate in the UK, even Holland gives it a more 'adult' rating of 16 and I guess this is because despite the awful and constant bludgeoning of each other, there is little or no blood. Strangely enough in the aforementioned Bava film, although the killings are not shown, the dead bodies are revealed as having what looks like a bottle of ketchup over them. I think maybe I'm rambling so I'll stop. To conclude, if you enjoy watching extreme violence perpetrated without the consequences being too apparent, this is for you."

THAT would have been a happy ending. Blind dude and his dog kill the intruders and eat them, then we see that this has happened many times. Why can't filmmakers have some original ideas?

","I seem to be in the minority, but I just truly did not like this film. And maybe it's just me, but using teen actors in a horror film like this always seem to be a downer. This is simply because most of them cannot act or they tend to overact and it quickly gets annoying. That was certainly the case here, with teen actors, it's just simply hard to sympathize with them from the start because their acting is so cringe-worthy. But let's talk about the film itself, shall we, the film is slow and boring, it takes about 30 minutes to get going, and when something finally does happen, it's nowhere near as intense as what it looks like. The fact that the bad guy is blind, what is that supposed to contribute to the film? Is it supposed to make the viewers feel sorry for him? What's the point of making a handicap for the bad guy? What, if he wasn't blind, he would have been able to easily see them and kill them? It makes no sense. In Hush, for example, even though I didn't like that film that much either, but it made sense to game the girl deaf because she was running from the bad guy, and it made the film more intense as they used the fact that she was deaf quite well in some scenes. But what is the point of making this guy blind, to add something unique to t he film? Fair enough, but to make him blind just takes out the fun a in a film like this. The fact that he is blind acts NOTHING to this film. <br/><br/>I'll end saying this, I can't really pin-point why I did not like this film. But, like I said, I found it slow and boring, and I never like teenage actors in horror films. In comedy films, they are fine, but in horror films, their acting never ever matches up, and you hardly ever feel sorry for them."

","This film has a solid premise for a horror thriller, and at times it's fun, but it also has major flaws. The characters are unlikable and 2 dimensional. A greedy thug, a whiny guy who spends the whole movie saying ""gosh I don't think this is a good idea"", and the female lead, who ends up being the hero of the film, is essentially worthless and literally watches as everyone around her does all the fighting and dying until the end when she's finally forced to take care of herself.<br/><br/>The villain (sort of) is by far the most interesting feature of this piece. His blindness, a result of an explosion during the Gulf War, is of course the crux of the film as once the former soldier realizes he has intruders in his home looking to take his inherited money, the tables turn and they have to sneak around hoping he won't hear them. Blind Man (seriously, that's the only name he is given) has some dark secrets to defend but there is also a rationality, albeit cold and brutal, to his actions, and he has an intriguing backstory that explains his motivations.<br/><br/>This film would have been considerably better with a little more love had been applied developing the characters we're supposed to like. One is left identifying with the villain more than the protagonists in this film, which would be fine if that were intentional, but it seems like an accident."

He lost his daughter, it never says how he got his million or I don't get how they to the code to his safe which brings me to my point.<br/><br/>How in ending when they find the kidnapped ""rich"" girl as they never go to jail as he puts it, would the police not find her in the bondage gear she was in and that room and not put two to two together about the blind mans daughter. It is the only plot hole but it is the ending and it would of been much better in my opinion if he just died or was in a coma.<br/><br/>Anyway, enjoyed it but the ending just bugs me. Is it set up for a sequel I'm guessing with what it made domestically? It's also hard to see that actor who gets shot opening the door and not think of 13 reasons why and his role in it after 10 plus hours of viewing that well made series."
"Icedooitle","7","0","2","16 April 2017"," Sweet Manipulation
","There is a special arrangement exclusive to the horror/thriller genre that audiences subconsciously agree to, we want to be manipulated. If manipulation is detected in any other style, it is met with incredulity and a sneer. The makers of ""Don't Breathe"" are shameless in their understanding of this paradigm. I surprised myself in how much I was willing to overlook the lazy writing of the first 20 minutes, and the gaping plot holes of the last 60, just to feel that enthralling sensation only a good thriller can provide. If you are such a stickler to continuity and details that ""Don't Breathe"" has no effect on you, it might make you a more astute viewer, but also a more pitiable one.<br/><br/>In simple terms this is an imperfect, but highly effective movie that sidesteps story structure to deliver one hellova setting. Once in that setting, we are given ample time to marinade in it, and believe it. 3 twenty somethings; Rocky, Alex, and Money (guess which one is the white guy with corn rows) start to grow more confident and desperate in their small burglary enterprise. Rocky is the stealthy blonde with doe eyes and small build, perfect for squeezing through tight entrances (or hiding places.) Alex is the brains and voice of reason; which doesn't amount to much as his breed of character never has enough confidence to be heard. And Money is the reckless muscle with an attitude who functions only to provide leads, break locks, and roll his eyes at good advice. When their most promising lead has a possible six-figure payday, aspirations of getting out of the gutters of Detroit bring them to a rundown suburban home with a plan that borders on incompetence. The reason for their frivolity, the target is blind. Stephen Lang is billed only as The Blind Man, a war veteran sitting on a possible fortune, hidden somewhere in a three-story pile of squeaky floorboards and crawlspaces. <br/><br/>This house has a familiar feel, like that of ""The People Under the Stairs"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" where daylight does nothing to brighten it. Knowing the present state of Detroit, it's unsettling to know this house is far from one-of-a-kind. Once our young prowlers enter, we get our first clear glimpse of the blind man. He whimpers almost pathetically with a sotto voce ""Who's There?"" His eyes don't look blind-stricken, more like something exploded from inside the eyeball. With battle scars spreading like cracked glass from the socket. After he appears in a doorway, you will find it hard to believe him as a victim. Stephen Lang is 64 with a body MMA fighters train tirelessly for. He wears a wife- beater for the duration, intimidating arms half-cocked at his sides. It becomes clear why he's not billed as the blind ""old"" man. With his loyal Rottweiler and dilapidated abode, the blind man draws on a nearly universal fear of the house around the corner you don't dare sell cookies to. <br/><br/>As you might expect from the trailers, power roles reverse and you ping-pong between antagonists and protagonists. If the twists and turns were set only on this basis, it would still be a compelling thriller, but ""Don't Breathe"" has much more up its sleeve. There are a few moments where things stretch a bit too far for shock value, but it is praiseworthy how infrequently ""Don't Breathe"" relies on them. This is a technical achievement with beautifully choreographed long-takes and staging that you can't call natural, but certainly can't call ineffective. At 90 minutes and a $9 million budget, it's a welcome break from the 9 figure marathons Marvel produces every 9 months. And as a side note, you will undoubtedly have a few plot holes start nagging at your brain on the ride home. If you think they're enough to ruin the movie, just imagine telling them to Stephen Lang in a dark room."

","The plot is on the surface somewhat predictable but does take a somewhat unexpected and welcome turn or two. However, most of the cast is weak and do not create enough suspense or emotion to match that by the lead (blind man).<br/><br/>The plot has numerous holes but this is not the type of film to dwell on these too much given the intent is to create a menacing atmosphere. As it does not succeed in doing this, the plot's weaknesses are brought into focus.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was a let down."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","3","3 April 2017"," Daddy of the Year
","""Don't Breathe"" is an American movie in the English language that is relatively short and stays under 90 minutes including credits. The writer and director is Fede Alvarez, who is probably Uruguay's most known filmmaker now with this film and the new ""Evil Dead"" in his body of work. Also he seems likely to work on the Lisbeth Salander film(s) in the future. But now let us take a look at this one here. Alvarez recast Jane Levy from ""Evil Dead"" and if you watch television shows, you may have seen her in ""Suburgatory"" as well. I personally like her quite a bit. She resembles recent Oscar winner Emma Stone a bit, physically and in terms of talent, even if she did not yet break through on the same level. So yeah I certainly like her, she is pretty stunning, even with bruised face makeup on her head and I also think she is pretty talented. Together with Stephen Lang from ""Avatar"", she carried this film nicely from start to finish. Levy is the only girl in a trio of semi-professional burglars who set out to rob people's houses. But when they decide to break into a former soldier's house, things don't go exactly as planned and even the fact that he is blind is not helping them at all as all his other senses are somewhat sharpened.<br/><br/>As for Levi's two male supporting actors, they are fine I guess. A bit generic in the ways they were written, especially the kind guy with his daddy and his crush on Levi's character etc. not too inspired. The other one was fun basically and in his crassness pretty entertaining, even if you somewhat expected what would happen to him after he ejaculated in people's houses etc. His demise still came surprisingly quickly. You can structure this film nicely into 3 parts I guess. First would be the introduction to the characters, what they do and their big plan. Second would be the fight for survival inside the guy's house. And third would finally be the solution about Lang's character and why he does what he does and of course the ending. I personally think the second part is probably the weakest. I felt a bit lost there at times. Maybe this was Alvarez' intention too that we would feel like the protagonists who don't know the place and have no clue where they currently are or what to do, but this middle part did not work out as well as the other two I think. Then again, I also did not really like the ending with the loud alarm system to be honest, even if it makes sense somehow. But the insemination scene towards the end was pretty good and really scary, even if the kid of course has to come the very moment Lang's character wants to get her pregnant. Why has he lived for so long anyway while the tough kid dies so early? A bit strange.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, Lang is really good here, strong physical performance. You will need subtitles if you don't speak English, but the movie is also really many times about silence and sounds rather than words, especially in the middle part. I personally liked the final shot as well when we see the two girls head away and even if the female protagonist almost paid for it with her life she committed the perfect crime somehow with what we see in the news at the very end. The biggest moral question arises with Lang's character of course. Sure he does and plans some despicable things in here, but is he really a victim or a perpetrator? He only hurts people who hurt him and cause him harm. And the horrors he's been through in war, the loss of his sight, the loss of his daughter and now maybe the loss of his fortune... If you see what he had to suffer through, is it so absurd that it drove him somewhat insane? And he does not want to kill the girl(s), just let them get away after nine months eventually. Anyway, I think this was a pretty good film. Alvarez did what he had to do in terms of plots (the subplot with the imprisoned girl) to get the film to the 1.5-hour mark and it's all working out pretty well I think. It did feel realistic in my opinion. Now I see there is already a sequel planned, apparently focusing on Lang's and not Levy's character which would somehow make sense and I will make sure I check that one out at some point because I give this first film plus Lang's and Levy's performances a major thumbs-up. A must see if you like psychological horror flicks."

","When this was advertised for the cinema, it looked amazing. The trailers made the film look like the masterpiece horror of 2016, not to be missed at any cost. After all the amazing reviews I read for this, I just had to sit down and watch it. I love amazing horror movies, and this seemed like the one that was going to be the best for the last of 2016, and the start of 2017.<br/><br/>This movie started off terribly slow. It didn't catch my attention at all, and I found my attention wandering and thinking about other horror movies I've been meaning to watch. Eventually, our main characters get to our veteran's house. There's still nothing to really drag you in at this point in time. It's not until about half an hour, forty minutes into the movie when you're really dragged in.<br/><br/>We're thrown in straight away into a tense situation that makes the viewer shiver and get goosebumps. You end up rigid on the couch, trying not to make too much noise. You watch in fear as our main characters struggle through an almost Saw like situation, trying to break out of the veteran's house after breaking in. <br/><br/>Then we have some weak fight scenes that again, made my mind wander, considering what movie to put on next.<br/><br/>Spoilers in the next paragraph<br/><br/>After this we have some very disturbing scenes in which he tries to artificially inseminate the female main character with things that are explained better within the movie than what I could do. I thought this would be a movie where disability =/= weakness, but it ended up with the disabled being totally psychotic and plain vile.<br/><br/>Spoilers over.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't end. It just continues on and on to the point where it's just overkill and no longer entertaining. The female character ends up becoming strong, finally, and it's welcome to see, but it was mostly a boring movie. I was glad when it was over, and I turned it off as quickly as I could. Give this film a miss; it was over hyped, treated it's disabled character terribly and also lacked decent characters. A definite failure of the horror genre."

","There is no way for me to give the movie a lower rating than 6. The acting and directing definitely make it a decently entertaining experience. That is if you're willing to switch of your brain for the duration of the movie.<br/><br/>I really don't mind a film in which none of the protagonists is really likable. Usually actually quite enjoy that style of storytelling, but edgy characters just don't help if too much stuff just doesn't add up.<br/><br/>I am not going to recap or summarize the movie. IMDb and many other reviews did that before.<br/><br/>Either you are still interested in watching the movie and then, again, as long as you're just up for some suspense without much thought, by all means go for it. You won't feel like you lost 90min of your life.<br/><br/>But be aware, it is a true plot-hole fest. If you mind that this is not for you.<br/><br/>Here is were I give my SPOILER WARNING! What follows are all the plot holes I could spot, so don't continue reading if you want to discover them yourself!<br/><br/>1. Why is it presumed he will keep his reconciliation money in cash at home?<br/><br/>2. While entering the home the three kids cause the dog to bark, rattle locks, smash glass... Our blind friend remains in slumber land, no problem.<br/><br/>3. Somehow the blind guy is immune to gas.<br/><br/>4. Once awake the blind vet's perception abilities are definitely heightened but quite selectively so. He can hear them breath. He hears a faint creaking of the floor. He smells their shoes from a two meter distance. Yet he is unable to smell them or feel their body heat when they are passing him bleeding and sweating in not even an arms length distance.<br/><br/>5. Why does he have an alarm system linked to the police when he has a kidnapped impregnated girl down in his basement?<br/><br/>6. This one is not a plot-hole but rather an uncalled for moral lesson by the writer. When the girl is about to take the place of the priorly kidnapped girl and starts praying he tells her 'there is no god, once a man realizes that he can do anything'. Yeah, right. Cause faith totally kept those kids from breaking into a blind man's home and also in general keeps people from say... raping kids, beheading people... While people without faith can't possibly have morality. F off.<br/><br/>7. Anyway, next plot-hole. When trying to impregnate here he cuts her jeans with huge scissors. We know he's successful cause he is about to proceed with inseminating her. However once her friend comes to the rescue her jeans miraculously recover completely which we can see perfectly in the ass shot during the dog-car scene. Man, I want a pair of those self repairing jeans.<br/><br/>8. Also, to keep sperm in a fridge is not that simple and you surely cannot warm it up on a gas stove. Destroys the protein. Renders the sperm useless. Complete BS.<br/><br/>9. I also really would like to know how the police just shrugged off his obvious sex kink kidnapping corner and home made sperm bank inside his basement. As well as the insane amounts of blood everywhere at least one DNA of which doesn't match with any of the dead burglars...<br/><br/>10. Also interesting when the girl who killed his daughter vanished the police seemingly didn't look into him at all.<br/><br/>So yeah, it just didn't add up at quite too many spots. Not blown away. Still the acting and directing were not bad, so it wasn't a complete waste of time."

There were a lot of inconsistencies with what Stephen Lang's character could do and what the kids got away with at times. I didn't really root for anyone due to the lack of character depth. There aren't any 'good guys' in the film so it had me not really caring who came out on top. And it had the absolutely grossest movie moment of 2016 for me, maybe the 2000's in general.

They spend most of their time together robbing various houses to get extra cash.

","This film, I had expectations. Especially on the basis of descriptions. I'm constantly searching for good horror movies, but they are sparse. There are few new ones that can measure up to the good old classics, such as The Shining. But here's mention good. It has high scores, and much praise. I gave Do not Breathe a chance tonight. And was very disappointed. There are three reasons for that. 1) The story is little original. We have seen this before. The characters have no personality or attractiveness to us who see the movie. We get no sympathy for them. 2) The action is so predictable that it almost is not to persevere. 3) An amazing little catchy ending. But it opens well for a sequel maybe? Let us hope that after this crash, comes the silence. The best thing I can write is that it is not very long and that there is a lot along the way. But do not expect to jump in his chair with fright. The film will surprise very little."

I was quite satisfied for Rocky to head into the sunset with her sister and cash, but what on earth convinced them to do the TV report! Are you telling me in the 10 seconds the police took to exit their car and enter the house the blind man was able to get up from being bashed to near death, hide ALL the evidence in the basement (maybe he could pass it off a a fetish room!) and the entire crime scene which spanned about 6 rooms.<br/><br/>Pathetic and unnecessary. <br/><br/>The plot needed polishing up big time.

They don't give enough reason for the audience to root for these guys. I mean, you try to rob a blind war veteran. Who's going to root for you? And Rocky is the only one with a background story, and not a very good one either. The others have zero background story. They could at least give Alex a little story and give Rocky a stronger one, so we would understand that she/they really need to do this.<br/><br/>However, once you get into the thriller part, this director really gives you no room to breathe. It really is one scary $#i+ after another without much break. And Stephen Lang really is one hell of a scary guy. I mean, I'm certain if I meet him off the camera, I'd be afraid he's going to stab me with a huge Army knife or something. The three kids are no slouch either in the acting department. It's like they're $#i++ing in their pants out of fear for real.<br/><br/>Really, if you want a good scary movie, this is it. This director is good and Sam Raimi is behind the production.

","Just got done watching Don't Breathe, and I've wanted to watch it months before its release (I just never got to it). <br/><br/>Honestly, there were good aspects in this movie. Parts of it was certainly thrilling, and the story line is very original. I think watching the movie, for most people, should be enjoyable, since it's not another cliché modern horror film. <br/><br/>As a horror/thriller fan though, I don't know how I feel about it. I've watched a lot of horror movies, and I do admit the plot is refreshing. But, I'm still debating with myself whether the rest of the movie is. <br/><br/>The characters are pretty cliché in my opinion...no character development...the movie mainly focused on creating a well-rounded character for the girl, which the story centers around. We're given minimal info about the lives of the other two guys. <br/><br/>I think people may complain about the fact that, as the movie progresses, it gets harder to decide which team to root for; the old guy or the kids. Thought slightly odd, I actually really enjoyed that. I even with the movie would've explored it more since it's interesting! But, I'll let you decide whether you like that or not. I know that creating a confusion in which characters to root for can just cause people to not care at all. The movie sort of shows us that both parties are bad, so I can see how people will find that bad. If you don't want or care for either side to winning, it's boring.<br/><br/>:) Not bad though!

","What works is its simplistic premise, short run-time coupled with breakneck pacing, unexpected twists and overall intensity. It sure has a recipe for a slick and gory B movie which can be actually enjoyed when watched lazily. But once you start putting a little brain to it, the whole thing crumbles like a pack of cards - a result of gaping holes in its plot, continuity issues, manipulative screenplay and hypocritical character morals.<br/><br/>Rocky (Jane Levy) and Money (Daniel Zovato) are a couple who along with Alex (Dylan Minnette) are small time burglars preying on empty rich houses. Money comes across a tip about an old & blind ex-military guy (Stephen Lang) living in an isolated house and sitting on some substantial money that he got as a compensation for his daughter's death in an accident. Their standard modus operandi is to go unarmed, when nobody is at home and just steel valuables and no cash - enforced by Alex considering the legal implications if they get caught. Will the blind guy become too much to handle for these experienced burglars where they have broken all their set rules? It is slickly made, highly focused and maintains necessary intensity throughout. However it over-glorifies a blind man's capabilities even in his turf where 3 relatively intelligent and healthy youngsters couldn't tackle him. A typical thriller movie screenplay is designed to play with the audience's train of thought (remember the climax of 'Silence of the Lambs') and this movie too has many such moments - but overuse of them could feel a little manipulative which is the case here. The self-righteous subplot that occurs in the basement is contrived which is followed by a hypocritical climax where the surviving member of the gang feels dismayed upon knowing that the blind man got away while they themselves opted for much worse choices in their life. So the empathy or sympathy just goes out of the equation leaving you no character to root for - I am fine with it but I think most of the audience looks for one.<br/><br/>Coming to the good points, if not in retrospect - one would find this movie to be an excellent thriller which is more than good enough. The objective of a movie is to provide entertainment when being watched - which it does. The actors are competent and there are moments where Stephen Lang brings depth to the blind man's character with very minimal dialogues that makes you more drawn into it. The relentless pacing hardly lets the audience a moment to process before the next twist or a jump-out-of-your-seat thrill pops up. It works mostly for the unexpected surprise in terms of how well it is directed despite its linear, simple but bumpy script.<br/><br/>Simple, intense, gory and well packaged.

It deals with three characters trying to rob a blind veteran at his secluded home. But what ensues is more than the three was prepared for. So yeah, I thought the set up was well done and I thoroughly enjoyed the camera work and how it transitions to the next scene. That also includes the editing as well, which is don't superbly for a film such as this. However when the chase and hid and seek ensues it quickly got boring for me. Mainly because there really wasn't any tension and because there just wasn't anyone to root for. The girl in the group had some fight in her, but the other two males was just so darn wimpy. I know it's because they needed to be wimpy because they are dealing with a blind man who is really built for his age. So the action can be dragged out longer. But it was just got so darn aggravating to watch during certain parts. It's pretty clear the director was inspired by David Fincher and his movie the ""Panic Room"". Except it's the burglars that are getting hunted this time around. The premise is like the zombie game. You know the game where the it person closes his or her eye or wears a blindfold and tries to tag others. While they run around trying not to make noises, well that is what this movie is.

A trio of teenage ""professional"" thieves break into a house whose blind owner they know is loaded with money. They then find themselves running and fighting for their lives as the owner senses their presence, is able to fight back, has some secrets in his house (including a rather vicious guard dog!), and thing get tense from there. The chases throughout the house and the twists at the end were the main highlights-other than that, this is OK at best. It depends on your tastes as to whether you'll like this movie.<br/><br/>** 1/2 out of ****"

","Three teenagers go around houses stealing valuables to resell them and make a profit. Although of a very young age, their dexterity when committing a robbery is quite remarkable. One day, they decide to go for a bigger pay day and enter the house of an old man who supposedly keeps $300000 in his house. What the three burglars don't know is that this blinded old man used to be a marine and he moves around the house like a cat at night. What should have been a straight forward robbery becomes an run for your life situation, where the marine will hunt them down one by one. The mechanics of the movie do not feel like anything new, and although you can guess a few of the things that will happen throughout, there's enough suspense to keep you entertained till the end. I would have preferred a different ending, but I keep that for myself. All in all, a decent enough movie. I have discussed it with a few friends and they all agreed that it is quite watchable. So there you go."

","The character portrayed as being blind was excellently delivered and acted out with superior class and proficiency. Shout out to the dog for being the realest character in the movie. The plot development kept us as viewers on our toes, and we did not expect any of the sudden changes regarding the secret nature of the blind man. We were conflicted between whether or not to empathize with the blind man, as he did not seem wholly evil by the end of the movie. Some plot holes became apparent through the lack of intelligence of the characters, for example when choosing not to kill the blind man given the opportunity.

","The movie is all about the suspense. When watching this movie you never know whats gonna come next. Although as the trailer states that some of kids get caught in the weird house. Director has amazed the audience by not showing just the house part. It'd have been boring if in all the movie only inside the house part'd have been shown. Overall the movie is a great horror creates a very good suspense and the plot is good. It's not just a one time watch movie. If you want to feel some real life horror. One must definitely watch this movie. The movie is understandable to everyone. The direction is good. The innovativness is in the story. Sometimes you feel about the poor kids which wants some money to fulfill their dreams or problems and in other case you fell about that old man who is blind and defensing himself from the thieves."

","so ... i just finished watching this movie. it was a good movie actually. not the best, but still good. the story line is amazing if we compared it to some new movies. shooting the film was just incredible! specially the slow-mo moments. they weren't like too much and the movie just keeps you wondering, thinking before you react about what is really happening. it is actually a great movie but it's not something that you would watch twice. i guess its ""half-classic"" it's not just ""too much"" or ""too little"" which is actually amazing. in some moments you would actually hold your breath and you can feel that you are really excited about whats going to happen. even if those moments aren't a lot and sometimes you can already expect whats going to happen. but, that actually makes it more realistic. some scenes(i'm not gonna spoil) you can feel the characters. feel their pain and what they are going through. the movie is about some young people from Detroit, Michigan. so you can already imagine how life is treating them. shout out to Eminem!!!! however, out of 10 ... this movie is 6.5/10 . it is a good movie but it's just not the best. do i recommend watching it ? YES! watch it people! even if its not the best it doesn't mean that its not amazing."

","It's a great comeback for the director after his first film, 'Evil Dead' remake had got a mixed response. This film might feel very familiar to you if you have got a good knowledge of the B movies. It was still a very refreshing and very thrilling. The film was short, because there were none segments wasted, it comes to the point quickly. I mean the event, because the story was a one liner, but the event was what this film based on.<br/><br/>Three youngsters who rob the houses when the people are out, mark their new target on a blind war veteran. But when it does not go as they have planned, they find trapped inside his house. Struggling to escape from there, they also get so close to what they had come for. Though it becomes a suicidal, and left without any option, what's next for them and the result of their attempt is what becomes the film's conclusion.<br/><br/>Really a great effort. Almost a one night based theme with the limited cast. The title is not just what the film revolves, it also for us to hold breath while watching it and most probably sitting on the edge of our seat throughout. But I'm very disappointed with many flaws, or maybe you can say those unexplained stuffs. Like the end seems very silly, because there were lots of evidence to prove the film character had committed a crime, but easily got out. Likewise there are many more, but the film does not explain and I believe there are sure reasons behind them.<br/><br/>The writers did not care to waste time on those, because they wanted only a thriller, a non-stop one and they got one. Now it is going to be remade in Kollywood and also a sequel was announced. I expected that when I saw the ending. Maybe, a prequel, though sequel seems more interesting idea after what happened in this. Surely one of the best thriller of the year, so make sure you watch it soon.<br/><br/>7/10"
"gtyoshida","9","0","3","23 November 2016"," Airtight Plot
","The ironic twist in the movie ""Don't Breathe"" is how it fails as a horror film but still makes the same dramatic impact as ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Director Fede Alveraz, who also co-wrote the script, brings a new villain to the screen. Steven Lang (Avatar) plays a blind, military veteran who lives alone in an old, decrepit home and like Hannibal Lecter, has no regard for human life. The vet also has a horrifying secret in his basement which three young thieves (Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto) stumble upon while trying to steal the old man's hush money. Although there is enough blood, ghastly shed, by the vengeful, ex-military man, the plot is so well written that our interest shifts away from the gore to the intriguing story and the chills running up and down our spine disappear. The IMDb rating seems spot on but in my books, this movie deserves critical acclaim; I give it 9 out of 10."

","When i saw the trailer for this movie it definitely didn't leave me with the feeling that i needed to watch it immediately. But boy, was i wrong. From the first 10 minutes of the movie you can tell that it's going to keep you on edge until the end. For me it definitely did the job of keeping me in suspense throughout the whole movie. I can say it's one of the best scary movies i've seen in a really long time and i think i've seen pretty much all of them. No scary ghosts or haunted houses in this one, just a very realistic, dark situation that doesn't require the paranormal to make it scary and even a little bit creepy and dark. Both Fede Alvarez and Jane Levy smashed it three years ago with Evil Dead and they did it again in this movie. For me Jane Levy it's an actress to keep your eyes on especially in the suspense, horror scene because she definitely has a clear talent for those roles. I totally recommend this movie to all horror/suspense fans because you are definitely not going to be disappointed."

","This is a tale of a blind veteran who has his home invaded by some villainous crooks.

Being disabled makes it that much more of a challenge for him, but don't fret he is a veteran and has some tricks up his sleeve. It is a tense film and you never know if he will survive the vicious crime or the harrowing night. Each of the criminals that force their way into his abode are equally fiendish, with nothing more than greed in their hearts, forcing him to jump into action and defend his house and belongings.

"orianelolivo","7","0","3","9 November 2016"," A good entertainment.
","I went to the cinema with my best friend to see this movie and I was really disappointed. First, I don't think that we can call this an ""horror"" film: it wasn't scary at all. According to the scenario and the trailer, I expected to feel oppress because of the ambiance and because of the fact that there is a blind and really dangerous old military who tries to kill the thieves. However, the manner to film the « frightening » scenes doesn't make you feel ""in danger"" and it is quite sad for a horror and thriller movie. Second, I found the main action a little bit too long. The girl escapes and finally not and then she escapes again, It is always the same and, at the end, it is boring. Despite of that, I have to admit that the character of Rocky (Jane Levy) is really lovable. The fact that she steels money to go away from her alcoholic mother with her sister makes you love this girl and you really want to help her. In addition, there are a lot of new and unexpected elements which are added during the film and that is very interesting because you know more about the blind man and you realize that he is completely crazy. In conclusion, the general theme and the screenplay are quite good but I find the production disappointing. I don't recommend you to go to the cinema to see it but it is a good entertainment to watch at home."

It starts slowly building tension with every minute and throws a couple of mysteries on your way to keep you aware that you don't know everything that is going on. Then in just one moment you get thrown on your seat in horror not knowingly what is going to happen and with blind man just showing his rage on one of our burglars. Eventually killing him left pure horror and fear for the other two, girl that is seems terrified to death and guy that is coming back to house without even realizing what will happen to him. Movie just keeps going and as they are trying to escape with stolen money in basement things show off and you are left in disbelief with what you see. After moment you are left to watch how blind man is haunting those two guys all over basement without any lights. You feel like there could be end to the movie and as blind man haunted them you get to final scene in the house where you feel like every hope for girl is lost comes the guy that should be dead and saves her. Throughout movie there's this sense of unknown and tension buildup that tends to grown into some chase scene and just keeping you in terror. Directing of the movie is absolutely incredible with some of the amazing shoots taken inside the movie with one shot scenes. Lang is absolutely terrifying and you can feel his grief, pain and sadness but at the same time he goes into crazy killing mode. Magnificent, terrifying, tense, incredible. 3.5/4"

","I cannot believe this movie got 7.3/10 ! Anyone who plays video games knows how to defeat a blind enemy, Distraction by noise. They do not even use that! they didn't even think of using their cell phone to distract him.<br/><br/>This movie would have worked if it was the 70's not 2016! Somehow the guys phone runs out of juice mid robbery, they did not think of leaving one phone in a location and call it. how about turn on the TV upstairs ? Radio maybe ?<br/><br/>The blind man's strength is in pitch black and they only used that in the movie for 10 minutes, yet they showed his soldier abilities.<br/><br/>Even if he is well a trained soldier, he cannot see. So hitting him from different locations would confuse him, just like the last scene in the house, if that scene was the first! They all would have left safe.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the story is very bad; they did not show any motivation for the robberies beside for the girl. For some reason a robber has moral and does not want to steal money! To prove that the writers couldn't give the guys a good background they had to add the kidnapped woman so you wont feel sorry for the blind guy. <br/><br/>This movie has so many goofs I got mad watching it....<br/><br/>2/10 Any other horror movie is better than this."

","Liked: Acting, premise, pacing, violence, twist, plot, atmosphere.<br/><br/>Not Liked: Several glaring inconsistencies, motivations, character development.<br/><br/>I stumbled over a reference to Don't Breathe in a Youtube comments section regarding Detroit's suburban housing death spiral. After reading 3 reviews I decided to watch it (mainly due to the 7 stars rating at this time). If I'd known Sam Raimi was one of the producers I would have automatically watched it, but I only found this out at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The film certainly has Raimi's touch so you know you'll be entertained. Give it a go just for this value alone. There's been better and worse films with this type of premise. The best one I EVER saw was PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS. God, that's a hard one to beat.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe is well paced and decently acted. This is a problem for me as my expectations rise as I watch but I'm less forgiving when they aren't met. <br/><br/>Don't Breathe is an OK movie but once again I blame the writing and producing (sorry Sam) for its shortcomings. When making a movie about people who rob houses, they could be either somewhat likable and potentially forgivable OR you need to portray them as human garbage. Thieves who target a blind man who has recently lost his daughter in the unsubstantiated hope that he has bags of cash stashed away have few redeemable traits in my opinion. I was already hoping Money would be killed after the first few scenes where, after breaking into a home, he isn't satisfied with merely robbing them. He vandalises the house and urinates on the floor as well. He is portrayed as a scumbag, and that's fine, it should help us cheer if his eyeballs got impaled (that doesn't happen but it should have).<br/><br/>Alex is a frightened, hesitant, irritating little dweeb. He doesn't fit their grouping at all. I assume he's so in love with Rocky that he'll do anything for her. This really wasn't explored properly and would have explained some of his motivations later after being shot and beaten. Coming back for more instead of getting the hell out of there when he had the chance seemed unlikely. If the producers were under time penalties (it's an 88 minute movie after all) competent writing can bring these idea's across quickly and strongly. But all the good 'filler'or development writing may have been cut to improve the pacing. You never know.<br/><br/>I wanted to like or feel sympathy for Rocky. Her life is pretty crap as shown from one short, rather cliché scene. Trailer park slut mum, poor little surrogate daughter syndrome thing that's going on makes her out as some sort of shining light. But mostly she comes across as a cold-hearted money hungry bitch who's willing to let other people get hurt as long as she gets the cash.<br/><br/>The Blind Man. Gee, he's an amazingly effective actor for a guy who has almost no lines. I was wondering if he'd be shown as having super-sensitive senses and reflexes but he's played pretty straight. The first murder he performs is definitely believable as he is trained to kill and still well muscled. And his motivation is explained as he's a grief stricken parent, blind, probably suffering from PTSD and living in a lonely wasteland. A streak of insanity and rage is understandable, and should have been used to greater effect. <br/><br/>Some stuff just didn't make sense. Inconsistencies like the following take away a measure of enjoyment for me as I dwell on them. Alex and Rocky get trapped in a room with bars on the windows so Rocky has to escape through a vent while Alex barricades the door. Then Alex falls out the window??? The cops don't discover the torture chamber in the basement???<br/><br/>And when Rocky gets away at the end I'm not content that she deserved to escape. And I felt very conflicted by the 'shock' ending which was tacked on for no particular reason and would have raised fewer questions if they'd left it out. I really didn't see why it's so terrifying that The Blind Man is still alive. Did she think an old blind dude was going to hunt her down? Weird.<br/><br/>Mainly I just hope someone let the bloody dog out of the car boot."

","Don't Breathe is a second movie directed by Fede Alvarez, the director of the 2013 remake of Evil Dead. Evil Dead was surprisingly very good and a fresh take on a story while paying homage to the original. Knowing this is by the same director, it got me even more excited. It's about three young burglars who decide to rob a seemingly helpless blind old man. But they had no idea who they were messing with. So, did it live up to the expectations. I hate to say this, but not really. At least not mine.<br/><br/>The movie isn't bad, it's another good twist on home invasion movies, it's got an amazing cinematography and sound design and Stephen Lang is terrifying as the villain of this movie. The problem is, it's not as intense as I hoped it would be. The movie itself is called ""Don't Breathe"", and the trailers made it look like this man is something like freaking DareDevil. But no, he can't hear every breath in the house and he's just a regular blind man with some nice skills. I know it sounds kinda stupid to complain about villain not being a super-villain, but that's how the trailers showed it and it made the film lose the sense of paranoia to soon. After a half, I just kinda started losing interest and I never really felt like I was at the edge of my seat. It wasn't boring, that's for sure, but I expected some more anxiety and the villain being a bit more powerful.<br/><br/>That's pretty much all I have to say about this movie. Everything else about it is solid, okay, but nothing remarkable. I'm not saying it's not worth watching, it has nice style to it, but if you decide to skip on it, you won't be missing anything special."

","Alvarez's Don't Breathe is a command, both to the characters and to us. The housebound thriller tiptoes behind three robbers who break into a blind Army veteran's home and awaken the angry giant, who grabs a gun and a hammer and nails them inside. If he hears a footstep, he shoots. To survive, the characters get so quiet you can hear their heartbeats. Spooks don't get more primal.Don't Breathe is stripped down to the basics: a dark, hushed house, heavy with dread, and a thousand things that make us choke on a scream, from a furious Rottweiler to a bit of broken glass that turns Rocky's sneaker into a tap shoe. It's effective misery. After Evil Dead, Fede Alvarez impresses again with Don't Breathe. I would go with 4.5/5 for this impressive and terrific movie."

","I watched this movie because Chris Stuckmann reviewed it so enthusiastically, and I generally like his horror recommendations. Short version: I left the screening disappointed. <br/><br/>The movie starts out great. The premise alone is very interesting: Burglars break into a blind man's house, but he's not as easy a target as they thought. It's a brilliant and promising idea that is handled exceptionally during the first two-thirds of the movie. <br/><br/>The movie is exceptional up to that point. The acting is perfect, the directing is precise and adds to the tension, the music is very good and avoids most of the horror clichés, pretty much everything works. So where did it go wrong?<br/><br/>Well, there is a part that feels a lot like the climax of the movie that comes in a bit too early. It's also a great climax. But then the movie kind of restarts, for no reason whatsoever, no explanation, and it gets boring, repetitive, and almost laughable (many audience members were groaning from a point on, although they were loud and annoying throughout the entire movie). <br/><br/>The last half hour feels like a mediocre (but not too cliché, to be fair) horror movie. Like they run out of ideas and just tried to fill in a proper runtime. The movie clocks in at just 88 minutes, so it seems very probable to me. And then there's an extra sequence after a cut to black, right at the end, that also feels unnecessary. <br/><br/>So, to sum up, my recommendation is to leave when you start getting annoyed (no spoilers but, trust me, you'll know what I'm talking about), then leave and read the synopsis if you want closure. Or make up your own ending. But spare your time and don't bother with the last half hour. It ruins the rest of the movie, which is easily a 9/10."

Yet, this one somehow manages to be entirely original in its execution, a feat accomplished by adding certain elements, twists and a cracking soundtrack to the script. <br/><br/>I am a firm believer that the soul of a movie is comprised of the script, its brains of the directional spice and its heart, of course, moved to beat by the performance of the actors. <br/><br/>Well, sir or madam, this film manages to manage all that coordinate work in a way that is generally reserved for the crème de la crème of movie-making. The fact that it is a horror/thriller only makes my rating shine in an even brighter light than a mere 8 out of 10. <br/><br/>The intensity is palpable, the tempo is relentless, the breathing non- existent, the performances terrific and the thrill, oh the thrill is f*cking there. <br/><br/>Being hailed as one of the best horror movies of the year, I was very much dying (no pun) to see it; one tiny something did not correspond to my pre-fabricated expectations in that the oeuvre cannot be clearly assigned to the horror genre. As alluded to previously, it much rather falls under the thriller/horror category, so if you are expecting supernatural manifestations, exorcisms, or the Casper Ghost, you shall in all certainty be left wishing for more.<br/><br/>In and of itself, it stands alone so far this year in terms of lifting my behind from the chair for >90% of its short running time, as(s) I couldn't keep sitting still even had I wanted to. <br/><br/>To quote the great M.J. ""You know it's thriller, thriller night"". Thrilling it was. And isn't that what a thriller is supposed to be?"

","This was a great thriller-slash-horror movie with some really good acting by an actor who I think has sadly gone under-rated for a lot of his career, Stephen Lang.<br/><br/>Lang plays a seemingly feeble and weak blind older man who three crooks deem to be ""easy pickings"" as far as someone they can rob. He apparently has a lot of cash in his house and taking it from him should apparently be just as easy as breaking in and walking out with it. Unfortunately for them things aren't quite as easy as they seem, which they quickly find out once they get inside the house. Lang is actually the one who will make them victims!"

Wow guys Don't Breathe is an appropriate name for this film, and you will see why when you watch this heart stopping thriller. Fede Alvarez does a great job directing in a manor that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Helped along by a score that will give you some nice jump scares. Stephen Lang is ultra believable as the villain, and is so creepy it's not funny. Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette as the protagonists are fantastic and leave you feeling and following them through their ordeal.

","**** May contain strong spoilers ****<br/><br/>This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....<br/><br/>This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.<br/><br/>A true hardcore thriller with horror emotions running through almost the entire movie. A low budget production with a lot of strength and charisma. The heavy environments and simple way of doing the cinematography and the visuals is tremendous. Terror is hunting two individuals down and the elements of emotional distress when watching this one is high here and there. Innovative with only three main characters throughout the entire story. <br/><br/>A claustrophobic act when the man and the woman is locked inside the house; this is is giving the film a well deserved and earned push. Simple story and yet so compelling and fresh at the same time. <br/><br/>Two very big twists that flips the story around and keeps it moving forward at the same time. Two twists that is well placed and made me on-edge at times. The blind man takes them one by one and he wants to get a new daughter... and how will he do that...?<br/><br/>Some references to the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (chased through the basement), ""Saw"" (when the girl is tied down in the basement, acted by Jane Levy) and a little taste of ""Cujo"" (the mad dog).<br/><br/>At the end of the movie I was having a little adrenaline going through me and wishing that this ""Don't breathe"" (or ""Hold your breath"") will be the only movie in contrary to the movie industry, where sequels is more common today. <br/><br/>When I thought it was all set and done (like I did three or four times), the motion picture is just going on and on and on and on... with a nice thrust every time. This movie is very well worth a watch, and I recommend it to the ones that want a moment with a simple, innovative, high octane and hard boiled thriller flick... with some deep horror elements.<br/><br/>One liner of the movie: The blind man: ""Nine months, and I will give you your life back.""<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : The production is great speaking of camera angles, the solid dark visual theme, the sound and the editing. Sam Raimi having a little say and touch to this one. Good! Director/writer Fede Alvarez, writer Rodo Sayagues, producer Sam Raimi and producer Rob Tapert, the composer Roque Baños, and also actress Jane Levy all worked on ""Evil Dead : 2013"" before this movie. - The actors : Both the directing made by Mr. Alvarez and the actors is there and in place... very good in balance of telling the story and keeping the tension and thrilling action going forward. Director Fede Alvarez has done a tremendous job with a minimum cast. Stephen Lang is delivering a very good performance creating a hard hitting ex-soldier with a criminal vengeance resulting in an gritty and dangerous man. - Entertainment : Been a while since a movie made me sit up and on edge. So I have to say ""Yes"" to that one. - Age : 15. Language, heavy violence and psychological aspects.<br/><br/>6,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment. 6 Nice production. Good movie.)"

They each have their own motivations as to why they need to do this and some are definitely stronger than others. <br/><br/>However, there's one thing they all have in common: M0NEY. And thus the fun begins. <br/><br/>This movie will have you on the edge of the seat from . . . the minute they start the break in. Seriously. And trust me, from then until the end of the movie, it is a sensational ride. <br/><br/>I tried to guess how it was going to end, something which I'm usually pretty good at. And I'd like to say I wasn't too far off the mark. However, the journey that it took to get there had twists and turns like no other and the ending didn't even matter that much compared to well. . . EVERYTHING else. <br/><br/>Let's just say these guys were blindsided by their own greed. (hehe)<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this was a tale about doing the right thing. And the characters are punished mercilessly for their mess ups. <br/><br/>You won't lose sleep over this film, like say a paranormal movie might do. But you'll definitely be thinking about it for a few days afterward -I know I was. <br/><br/>And in this case, I feel an 8.5 is most accurate, however, I've settled with a 9. <br/><br/>If you're a thinker, enjoy suspense, and a really great story line. <br/><br/>Check out Don't Breathe. <br/><br/>I'd recommend watching this in cinemas or at least in a quiet room with surround sound to get the full effect from the suspense.If you can't, it's still an excellent film regardless. <br/><br/>Enjoy."

It has really given major thrillers a run for their money, but it is a great movie, definitely a must watch but not with really big expectations for the hardest critique. The fact that teenagers that are so desperate to rob a blind man and think that nothing will go wrong brings chills to some people. The blind character seems to be the innocent and defenseless man who in fact turns out to be much more than that. we have all watched a movie and wish we could have a different ending so it is a movie that will make someone scream in a movie theatre at all the jump scares."

","Don't breathe kept me entertained from beginning to end. The creators are able to put a spin on this overdone genre that gives this movie an original feel to it.<br/><br/>The plot goes like this - A group of petty thieves learn about an old house in an abandoned neighborhood, owned by an old man is full of cash of the taking. They break into his heavily protected home and make an attempt robbing him. Not everything goes as they've planned and they end up fighting just to make it out of the house alive.<br/><br/>Nothing comes easy for the main heroes in this story. Most of the time they have to try two or three different things before they get the result they are looking for. This made the movie seem a lot more realistic to me. <br/><br/>Besides plot, The direction of this movie was very well done.

"koen_smit","7","0","3","30 September 2016"," Interesting and exciting movie, but dragging a little at times.
","This movie is more a Thriller than a Horror film. We have a lot of suspense and scary moments where we need the kids to escape the house of the evil blind veteran. Or isn't he evil? We ask that question many times, because it looks like this man is protecting his house and money from burglars. Although there are more locks on the door than seem to be necessary, and some you don't want to open. <br/><br/>We had a fun time in the cinema, I love watching these kind of movies in a crowd because it gives a feeling of sharing the same fears and scares all together, which make it fun instead of troubling. Some films you just shouldn't watch alone. With this one that would be perfectly fine, it's not that scary, there is no gore apart from a little blood and a shot wound here and there. <br/><br/>The acting is good, good enough for this movie. The blind man doesn't talk for most part of the movie and when he does more than just a sentence, it's a little distracting because it feels late to introduce that with one of the main characters. <br/><br/>The setting is good, although I must say that the basement must be probably 6 times bigger than the whole house. Does it spread under the whole neighborhood? <br/><br/>It ended rather abruptly. After wanting to finish several times (but delaying the ending) we suddenly have the end titles. Funny enough it was an interesting and exciting movie, but by dragging it a little too long at times we were a little bit bored."

","I have seen my fair share of movies and although I kind of liked this one I couldn't help but wonder. Why did this movie seem so familiar? Well, probably because an almost identical movie was shot a couple of years ago. Some might know that movie under the name ""The Collector"", which is also a really good Horror movie of it's own. This movie seemed just too similar to the aforementioned movie. The only real difference was that this movie had a blind ""bad guy"" in it. <br/><br/>On a side note: The one thing that this movie did really well was creating suspense. Somehow the blind antagonist had super-hearing abilities which at first glance seemed like something out of a Marvel comic (Yes, I'm talking about Daredevil comics in case you didn't get the reference). It's definitely not a bad movie but the fact that it borrows so many themes from ""The Collector"" makes it a little unoriginal."
"Darkhorse_Knight","7","0","3","22 September 2016"," DHKR: Don't Breathe
","Don't Breathe is actually a really unique kind of horror movie that delivers what it advertises, and then some. Even if some of the extra stuff is kinda...out there for most viewers. <br/><br/>No Spoilers here, just recovered from a bad head cold, and I'm just getting back to writing reviews on here. All you need to know is the movie works well as a scary movie, much like last year's The Witch. And for those who have not seen that particular film, The Witch was a scary movie that was more aligned on the darker themes rather than the terrifying being itself. It felt less like a modern scary movie, and more like a very dark drama that just so happened to be about a witch.<br/><br/>Don't Breathe is pretty much like that; a very dark movie with themes of revenge, that just so happens to have a presence that's scary. In this movie's case, a psychopathic, blind Gulf War veteran simply known as ""The Blind Man"". <br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple for most horror fare. Three teenagers who expertly rob the houses in their dying neighborhood learn of the Blind Man's fortune, about 30,000 USDs, and presume to break in at night, believing it to be easy. However, they soon find out that this supposedly ""easy"" target is anything but, and one of the kids gets shot and killed off by the Blind Man. Soon, the movie turns into a game of cat and mice, as the remaining two thieves have to find the money and get out, before getting killed themselves by the psychotic war vet.<br/><br/>The movie goes out of its way to be as dark and original as it can with it's premise, and it well succeeds in that regard. The victim characters are set up as punish rogues with good hearts(at least two of the three are), which at least make them more sympathetic than the usual kind of idiots. The Blind Man is also set up as a sympathetic villain from the start, but that gets turned up on it's head after an actually well kept twist that I dare not spoil to those interested. The claustrophobic feel of each scene, combined with the super-senses that the villain has makes for some extremely tense moments that will leave you in a cold sweat.<br/><br/>I wish I could continue on, but I can't without spoiling some good twists. Go and watch the movie, and experience the horror yourselves."

","The first half of the film was extremely tense and genuinely uncomfortable to watch, exactly what a thriller should accomplish. The story was brought to life and it made a top class horror (first half). But just like every other modern day thriller it got a bit silly. I was very disappointed with some of the routes the story took as going of the first half it had the opportunity to be a brilliant film throughout. It reminds me of what a lot of people thought of 10 Cloverfield Lane, brilliant story, brilliant actors, brilliant execution but ruined by being silly. However I don't think the silliness could've been a lot worse. Stephen Lang honestly made the film, a genuinely frightening character, I would definitely recommend this film, 3.5/5. Definitely would've been 5/5 if it had carried on what it achieved in its first half with the sophisticated story lines and execution."

","To those who think that just because someone is disabled that means they are fragile, vulnerable people, just tell them to watch Don't Breathe, a movie about a group of scumbag teens who break into an old blind mans house only to find he isn't as disabled as they thought. This premise has the potential to be a really scary and nail bitingly suspenseful horror thriller and to a degree it was. The film is tense and has you constantly gripped start to finish but isn't particularly surprising or scary overall.<br/><br/>Firstly, I think director Fede Alvarez did a good job with this film. When the film feels like it has nowhere left to go due to the contained location of the house, Alvarez finds a new interesting way to manoeuvre the film into another room and situation. A complete change from the blood and gore of the Evil Dead remake, Don't Breathe showcases Alvarez's directing range in the horror genre. This film works more as a suspense thriller than a horror film but either way Fede Alvarez will keep you suspensfully entertained until the end.<br/><br/>The main issue with the film for me was the lead character, Rocky. I didn't like her at all. SPOILER ALERT, sure she had a sister who she wanted to get out of the abusive sh*t hole that is their mothers home, but she basically emotionally manipulated Alex to his death even if didn't intend to she still knew. I propose that instead the film should have focused on Alex and gave him the sister and sh*t home life and still have him say no to the blind mans house, but have the change of heart be motivated by his younger sibling. It also wouldn't have follow the ""final girl"" cliché in horror movies, which would have been a nice change for once.<br/><br/>Overall, Don't Breathe is a well directed suspense thriller that isn't particularly scary or surprising but will definitely keep you hooked. What i've noticed about this film is that damn those kids can take a beating and that ""turkey baster to the mouth"" bit was absolutely hilarious I mean literally laugh out loud. But anyway, all hilarious semen filled meat utensils aside, Don't Breathe is a good movie that will, dare I say it, leave you BREATHLESS!"

All the actors did a fantastic job and we get to see the best of all expressions, which is fear, on their face. The story line is great but I think I found out few loopholes, which I am totally going to neglect because overall it was an excellent experience. The characters were all very witty, not at all dumb like they are in similar kind of movies as we have seen in the past. So, I would totally suggest you watch it in theaters. The sound(or I should say silence) creates the atmosphere as if you are in the same situation, in the same house. Also, some of the scenes were, yes, breathtaking."

","7.5/10<br/><br/>Don't Breathe is a 2016 suspense film directed by the Uruguayan Fede Alvarez and co-written by his usual partner Rodo Sayagues and takes the prize for the biggest surprise of the year.<br/><br/>The story follows a group of friends who decide to break into the house of a seemly harmless blind man that they think is hiding a fortune. But when the blind man turns out to be far more dangerous than they expected, trapped inside the house they must find a way to escape.<br/><br/>One of the greatest things about this movie is its characters. On one side we have Rocky a young woman wanting to start a new life on another city and give her little sister the life she deserved, and on the other we have The Blind Man a war veteran who is trying to get by and continue with his life after the death of his daughter. Of course our perception of the characters gets a bit altered once we face the fact that our protagonist Rocky and her Friends are common thieves, that are going to break into his house even when ""is messed up to rob a blind guy""; and after we see that the Blind Man is willing to do ANYTHING to protect his home. This leads to an amazing cat and mouse chase inside the house that will surely take your breath away a couple times. <br/><br/>The cinematography and camera work is just perfect for this kind of movie. The long tracks following the characters really makes you feel the fear and claustrophobia, the movement and close-ups of the Blind Man made him look almost inhuman sometimes. Fede did an amazing work making it look this realistic and scary. I must also point out some incredible night vision scenes that blew my mind. Very innovative in most the technical points. <br/><br/>Including some very creepy scenarios this movie does not go away without its punch, but even when we are witnessing horrific acts the moral dilemma stills there, there are reasons behind every action, and that does not let the sympathy fade away. To me that fantastic character building and if a movies lets you wondering who was on the right or wrong at the end of it shows good character construction. However after all this praise I must admit the story has its plot holes, specially leading to the end of the film when big things are finally revealed to us, but fortunately it does not take away the enjoyment of the film. <br/><br/>Overall: Is this movie A MUST? I'd say so, if you want a well-done suspense film."
"jtindahouse","8","0","3","16 September 2016"," An above average horror film
","A 7.6 rating on IMDb is incredibly high for a horror film. So when I saw 'Dont Breathe' contained such a rating before going to see it, I suspected I was in for something pretty special. Director Fede Alvarez' one previous film, the 2013 remake of 'Evil Dead', was a very fine film. It was intense, scary and brutal. A new director stamping his mark on the genre from the outset. Could he live up to it a second time though? I think you'd have to say he did. This time he takes on an original story (a breathe of fresh air in the horror genre) that he has written himself. It's an intriguing premise. A blind man being robbed, who is more capable than first perceived and chooses to fight back. Then add in some extra twists and turns along the way and you have yourself a lot of potential. But we know that in this beloved genre of ours potential doesn't always equal results.<br/><br/>Luckily Alvarez clearly has the filmmaking talents to pull it off. It's a very different type of story to 'Evil Dead' and yet still captures the same levels of intensity and brutality. One thing I didn't like was the opening scene showing a man dragging a character down the road. I love opening scenes that give a sneak preview into something that will occur later in the film when they are done right, but this simply wasn't. That type of a snippet should give the audience a ""Huh?"" feeling or a ""How the hell are they going to make sense of that?"" thought. This one achieved neither of those. Other than that though there really isn't a lot to criticise here. The acting is good, the directing is good and the whole experience is pretty damn enjoyable. 7.6 to me implies it should be one of the best horror movies ever made. To me it certainly didn't live up to that kind of level, but make no mistake, Alvarez is a director to take note of in the future."

","Don't Breathe <br/><br/>""You would be surprised what a man is capable of once he realizes there is no god."" - The Blind Man.<br/><br/>A very tense and progressive modern horror film, which I enjoyed this film very much for several reasons. <br/><br/>The first I would say that it has a unique narrative in which you don't really know who's side is the right one, if either are. The film is about 3 young adults who are going to break into a blind man's home and steal his $300,000 left to him. So immediately you think you are on the side of the villains. But once things get going the morality shifts and changes throughout giving lots of twists and turns and so you don't really know where the film is going despite it being based completely in one place. <br/><br/>The 2nd reason I liked this film was the camera work, it was quite experimental it seemed because of the unique shots and the ways they were captured, for example when the kids first broke in there was a sequence in which they were all looking around on the 1st floor with the camera moving from one character to another in one long continuous segment. The colour grading was gritty but beautiful giving a mostly green tint overall which could possibly suggest envy because the blind man has what these kinds do not which is money but the kids have sight, youth and hope which he does not. It could also symbolise the old famous 'It's not easy being green' expression as they are in his territory which is the only place he does not feel banished from or unwelcome. But whatever the reason for this vibrantly asserted colour it was quite nice on the eyes. <br/><br/>I liked the characters to an extent despite them not being particularly likable. None of the characters in this film have much to like about them but the film did not dwell too much on their back story it sealed up what they are about in about 10 minutes and got right to the nitty gritty which I think was a good idea.<br/><br/>To me the core of this movie was about the suspense and the morality, it was very tense at times where you cannot tell what is going to happen and who is going to strike next, shifting the roles of protagonist and antagonist frequently, and if I am honest I was routing for both sides and neither throughout, which was a fascinating experience because this was a completely different take on the house invasion theme. One aspect of the story I did not think was fully developed was the story of the 'ladybug tattoo'. This could have been more meaningful to the story and the character of Rocky but in the end did not seem to have much point to it. <br/><br/>I give this modern, unique, suspense horror a 7.5 out of 10."

However, as they are planning their burglary, they discover that this man is blind. Some of them are skeptical, but not enough to call off their plan. Once inside, they realize this is no ordinary house and they are dealing with no ordinary man.<br/><br/>Is it worth seeing? Why or why not? This thriller suspense film is unlike any before it. Usually in a scary or thrilling movie, it seems that all the anxiousness felt by the audience is brought about because they know the characters are in trouble. You want to scream at the character to run and hide and just pray they are faster and better than their predators. However, in this film, the blind man could not see the ones he was after. The only way they could escape was just to be quiet and hope he would move into the room. In the audience, nobody yelled or screamed, it was silent; everyone captivated. Alvarez did an excellent job of placing irony in a horror film. Why should anyone fear a blind man? Surely the characters with all their senses would have the upper hand.<br/><br/>The cinematography was another notable quality in this film. The camera weaved throughout the house, showing everything that would be of use at some point in the film, in one long take. It had a David-Fincher-like feel (for all the cinephiles out there).<br/><br/>Weaknesses? The one major critique of this film is that the protagonists are not nearly likable. Their motives are understood, but it is hard to feel a great deal of empathy for amateur robbers. Also, there is one child actress in this film that could have been better hand selected by going into a Chuck-E-Cheese and asking the kid at the nearest Whack-A- Mole machine if they wanted to be in a movie for 50 seconds.<br/><br/>In Conclusion This film is different than the average scary movie and is an incredibly unique idea for a movie. If you are in need of something to do on any upcoming Saturday night, this would not be a bad way to spend it."

","Don't Breathe is a well put together film and excels in many areas where many horror/thriller films fail.<br/><br/>This film puts together and extremely tense mood with twists and turns. There are a variety of setups and payoffs throughout the plot that make it fun to watch, but the movie is never really *predictable*, which is ever so important!<br/><br/>Horror fans will be pleased that a mainstream thriller/horror has been delivered to theatres that doesn't just rely on jump-scares and violence, and certainly is not a ""laugh along"" film.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I believe the wrap up of this film is its weakest point. It's not that it is in any way a let down or poorly done—it's just a bit too bland and average whereas the rest of the film certainly isn't.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the best horror/thriller films I have seen in a long while.<br/><br/>Some may be wondering why I don't rate it 10/10 then—and that's because those ratings are saved for films like City of God :)<br/><br/>But as far as horror/thriller films go, and for that this film was trying to accomplish, it certainly did succeed and it is a top notch film."

","this is not my usual fare, but I heard good things about it, so I went on a Saturday afternoon and a good time was had by all. basic premise-three morons break into houses to steal stuff and sell same to a fence for peanuts. the fence tells ""money"" about a big score for cash and off we go. the hitch is that the house money, rocky and alex break into is owned by a blind man, who turns the tables on them by turning off the lights. he also has a gun. I know, I know. but it worked for me. Stephen lang as the blind man is very intense, and the young woman playing rocky is more of a man than either of her robbing partners. I don't remember a horror movie where the woman is a strong character, at the expense of the men. kudos. go. you'll have a good time."

","This is not a horror movie, that it claims to be. This is more a suspense, thriller, kind of movie. Really, not scary at all, and if people are rating it for that, then they are nuts. It is more intense and suspenseful, than being a horror or scary movie.<br/><br/>This is about 3 friends that are partners in robbing homes. Yes, I said friends because another review said Money was a boyfriend of Rocky, which is not at all true. They were just closer than Alex, that got a hold of his fathers keys.<br/><br/>Money hears about a new job that makes a lot of money, but they made a pact, not to go for money, but this time it was different, and Alex was skeptical about it and then gave in. They found out this veteran and being blind man, would be an easy job.<br/><br/>Turns out that it was not as easy as they thought and it turned out to be two of them killed and one escaping with the money at the end. Not going to say, but you will probably already figure it out, by me just saying that.<br/><br/>Anyways, this is definitely not a horror movie at all. Not as much as The Purge was. This is just trying to get out of the house and not make a sound at all kind of movie. Nothing like The Collector either.<br/><br/>I read another review that compared to Sinister, but nothing like that either. Horror is usually something supernatural or evil to be a horror movie. This is nothing like that. So don't go in thinking it is.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed for not being like a horror movie, but loved it as what it was, and that is suspenseful, thriller movie. I recommend to go see it and enjoy it. I did, and I would watch it again if it went on television.<br/><br/>This kind of movie that would be great on broadcast television. I went on Tuesday that is $5 and worth that too, and probably worth more if I went on another day."

","I went to a screening of this film last night, not expecting anything or having any prior knowledge about the film. I have to say, the overall experience was an enjoyable one, albeit, not one I would remember through the ages. In fact, the moment the film ended and the more I thought over it, the less likable it seemed to get. At first, I blamed it on the insanely high standard Hollywood has set for movies and TV in this day and age that it seemed to have stolen away the light this movie deserves. But then I realized something that would be a lot helpful for those wanting to see this movie: Do not take this movie too seriously. This home invasion genre film serves as a well shot, neatly written and decently acted addition to a lineup of predictable, boring movies. Don't Breathe manages to satisfy moviegoers by avoiding genre- traps that would've ultimately changed the entire narrative of this review, and for that it gets special recognition! Got some time on your hand? Give this movie a watch."

","Don't breathe has effortlessly entered into my favourite heart pounding nail-biting thriller list. <br/><br/>It has broken all pre fixed notions I had like it would be a home invasion gone wrong, Psycho killer, Haunted house with a possessed person, creepy creature attack. But this was a bit different from the above said track and definitely hit the right chord what an intense thriller has to deliver.<br/><br/>Some of you might come back and argue it's a home invasion thriller but why I deny that point is here the invaders become the victims of the inmate of the house.<br/><br/>Long story short three friends break into a house of a blind man thinking it would be a piece of cake to rob some dollars and run, but they didn't know that they are in for a crazy ride of survival. Well that's enough not to spoil further as this much was shown in the trailers.<br/><br/>Stephan Lang as the blind man had nailed it to the core where he didn't have long dialogues but has brought out the fierceness and terrifying looks through his actions and body language. I would say he provided me more thrills than other creature feature movies so old uncle feature wins the creature feature. Jane the lady from Evil dead's recent remake has also emoted well and her desperation over the money even in the life or death situation was a shocking surprise. <br/><br/>Very well managed budget movie inside a small house but can sure give you at least five six jumping up moments and stopping the heart beat moments for sure. Get in and you will enjoy the thrills by this crazy old man.<br/><br/>I would definitely give a 7.5 on 10. Except for the logic holes here and there the movie delivers 100%. Thrills and chills guaranteed. Watch it in the theatre.<br/><br/>-Sivakumar Balachandran"

","As someone who is extremely frustrated with horror movies these days, I can definitely say that 2016 has been a great year for Horror and R rated feature films, and Fede Alvarez's ""Don't Breathe"" is no exception, ""Don't Breathe"" is an intense, inventive, and well crafted offering from the people who brought you 2013's ""Evil Dead"" remake, the film is definitely not without its faults, it lacks character development, doesn't quite know how to end itself, features some questionable acting, and is plagued by stupidity like most Horror films, but thanks to Alvarez's great direction, Stephen Lang's haunting performance, and being a unique twist on the home invasion Horror/Thriller, it succeeds more than it fails."
