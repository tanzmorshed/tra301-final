"Troy_Campbell","4","133","153","4 January 2016"," Impressive action sequences let down by almost everything else.
","A Gen Z update to Kathryn Bigelow's 1991 cult classic, this remake is essentially an episode of Fast and Furious in which the vehicular exploits have been replaced with an assortment of extreme sports sequences. Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like ""the only law is gravity"" and ""everyone dies, it's just a matter of how"", it's nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi. The same can't be said for low-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as Johnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis. This modern update boasts a handful of genuinely fantastic action sequences, yet they're not enough to warrant a recommendation in what is otherwise a limp and incoherent thriller."

","If you like those 3 or 5 minute GoPro or Red Bull videos of people doing extreme sports then you will certainly like most of the movie as a lot of it is exactly that - and to be sure, those moments were pretty cool to watch and very well done. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, in between all of those moments is a pretty boring plot line with characters that you never really care about.<br/><br/>If you like mindless action (nothing wrong with that) then you will probably like this movie - although most of the ""action"" is extreme sports, not really guns.<br/><br/>Apparently I have to write at least ten lines of text, but honestly there isn't much more to say about the movie!"

","Beware people, this is an early review. Being a member of a media group I caught an early screening at the Amc. I was not required to sign an NDA.<br/><br/>Point Break is a bafflingly unsolicited remake of the 1991 cult classic of the same name. It is directed by Ericson Core, a good filmmaker who directed the 2006 Invincible, a film which is criminally underrated. When I found out that Point Break was being remade I shuddered in fear, but I when I learned that Core was directing the film, I immediately changed my tune, as I hold Invincible in such high regard, as it truly is an under appreciated film for the ages.<br/><br/>Point Break 2015 is grotesque. <br/><br/>I am not inherently adverse to remakes and reboots, and I am not at all a purist, I am perfectly fine with rebooting material and straying from source material if it serves the story well. What had happened here is that the studio has produced a garden variety action movie and slapped a name on it purely for the sake of brand recognition.<br/><br/>The film exceeds expectations in the sense that this a slickly produced action film with a completely rad soundtrack. The camera work, framing and editing leave everything on the proverbial field. There isn't anything new going on here, but it's produced in a professional manner and the action scenes are handled with extreme care.<br/><br/>And along comes the story, instead of our group of guys pulling bank jobs to fund adrenaline junkie lifestyles, the action men of 2015 are self aware crusaders, too cool for school, hipsters on a self imposed mission from God. Every character in this film is ball- kickingly annoying. The problem is that not one of the main characters are in possession of a redeemable quality and their motivations are completely nonsensical, they are all essentially unknowingly pseudo intellectuals.<br/><br/>If this movie had been titles virtually anything else I may have given it a 4 or 5 out of 10, rather than a three, though the unnecessarily and intentionally sanitized PG13 vibe completely disrupts any potential the film may have had in the first place.<br/><br/>It's not good, it stinks.<br/><br/>No sir, I don't like it."
"gpower40","1","49","63","10 December 2016"," This is an awful movie and is a disgrace to the original.
","This is my first review on IMDb. I felt compelled to write this in protest to what I believe is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's so bad that I will be watching out for future films by the Directors, actors and writers to avoid all their future efforts. The original is a bit cheesy but it's enjoyable. This is all cheese. I'm amazed that it was allowed to be put out to the cinema in its form. Nobody but the stunt team can get credit here. Similar stunts can be seen in a more realistic form by a simple You Tube search. Please don't watch this. The lines in this movie are so bad you would laugh if you were not so angry. I can't believe it obtained a rating of 5 on IMDb. 1 at best."
"rchoate-88390","2","94","127","29 December 2015"," What a let down
","I was enthusiastically exuberant about returning to what I've known as a cult classic, the original ""Point Break"". This reboot, is full of slick stunts and visuals, but the story, or lack thereof, makes this taste like pablum. I very seriously doubt that after two hours from getting out of the theater watching this, that anybody would even remember the name's of the central characters in this film. Why, because the film maker neglected to give us a story where the characters are expounded and fleshed out beyond the 3 minutes for any resolute back-story on any of them. I appreciate the stunts and stunt people for their quality work involved, but stunts don't make a movie. A good story, with quality characters that are inter-meshed with emotions and plots that pull the viewer into the characters' world is what makes a memorable film. I'll stick with the original ""Point Break""."
"samgiannn","2","105","145","26 December 2015"," Point Break (2015)
","I sincerely hope the original Point Break is much different than this lifeless, hippy-dippy, overblown Mountain Dew commercial. I've never seen the original movie, so I have no bias towards it. Based on the movie's own merit's, the Point Break remake is laughably awful. In Point Break, a rookie FBI agent tracks down a group of extreme athletes who go around the world carrying out crimes in unusual and life-threatening ways; they plan to do a series of near- impossible stunts called the Ozaki 8 in hopes of reaching spiritual enlightenment. At least, that was the plot for about ten minutes before the movie devolves into a series of party scenes and surprisingly dull extreme sports clips that could have been easily viewed on YouTube, all set to irritating club music. It takes a special director to make BASE jumping and cliff diving this boring. Ericson Core builds as little suspense as possible in his action set pieces and instead films admittedly well-shot highlights reels for the action scenes. Any sort of suspense conjured up is because of the great cinematography because the characters are so flat and annoying that you almost wish they would get killed off. Everyone in this movie acts stoned out of their mind. All they do is spit faux- philosophical nonsense which gets tiring after the first twenty minutes. It gets laughable towards the end of the movie with lines like ""Ideas are strong. But not as strong as a whaling ship,"" and no amount of context will make that line any less ridiculous. The unbearable dialog, muddled plot and dull characters makes this Point Break remake utterly pointless. If you're not a fan of remakes, this will make you reach your breaking point."
"quincytheodore","6","91","125","3 December 2015"," Nonsensical plot accompanied by visual splendor of world's most extreme corners.
","Imagine the intense stunts from energy drink commercial or Youtube extreme sport montage while music from Mad Max blares on background. This is where the second coming of Point Break truly excels. When it hits just the right velocity, it's bloody breathtaking. Unfortunately, the narrative is not only poor, it nearly sabotages the movie like a broken parachute.<br/><br/>Story revolves around Utah (Luke Bracey), an FBI trainee as he investigates a series of heists and their connection to a group of athletes led by Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez). As one might expect, it follows the same trail that Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze has placed. The new leads do what they can, although it's better to watch this without comparing, because it certainly doesn't have the same caliber of star or chemistry.<br/><br/>The plot then dives head first into uncharted territory. It's littered with so much ""save the planet"" preachy acts as the writing struggles to place FBI agent in the hippie nirvana angle. The motivation is just a mess of random vague one-liners, even the on-screen characters are perplexed by it. There's a romance subplot, but this is mainly to show the attractive Teresa Palmer as eye candy for several short scenes.<br/><br/>The movie is actually better when they just show the crazy sequences instead of forcing its lackluster story. It has plethora of impressive feats, from high heaven wingsuit flying, the climb on hazardous urban streets and natural cliffs, to the surfing of gigantic waves. This is the level of stunt choreography xXx and Fast and Furious wish they had.<br/><br/>When camera pans into the right angle and lighting, as the sounds is muffled by throbbing tune of the fast music, Point Break reaches the zenith. It's miles beyond what typical action flick could offer, but sadly it's repeatedly interrupted by the shoddy story, which feels like an excuse to fly across the globe to do random cool tricks.<br/><br/>If viewed only on the grand mix of cinematography and choreography, Point Break is exquisite, this would have been a great documentary of extreme sport. However, as action movie, the story is so pretentious, it simply serves as speed bump to hamper the thrill."
"utgard14","2","14","16","23 May 2016"," Point Broken
","Let's put aside the asinine logic that went into the decision to remake Point Break to begin with. Let's just focus for a moment on whether or not they produced a good movie, regardless of whether it was an original idea or not. When we do that I think most of us can agree they failed miserably. This is a boring, unengaging movie in every way. The two leads are lacking in any charisma or appeal. They are both just so dull and lifeless I cannot begin to understand how they were cast in an action movie, let alone a remake of a superior action movie with two leads that played well off each other. But these two being so boring fits the tone of the film, one of the more unexciting excuses for an action movie I've ever seen. The original Point Break was a fun movie. This thing is dire and seems to believe it has a message, which makes it even worse. It's really just a lackluster movie all around. I guess the one positive it has over the original is that Teresa Palmer is nice to look at and the original movie just had Lori Petty."

The characters are stiff like frozen cucumbers, the purpose and motivations are completely ridiculous. This is a disgrace of a movie. It is as if the director wanted to create the horrible anti point break. Oh My God! Oh My Buddha! Wasted life! There is no logic, the characters are half-dimensional, the star is beyond ridiculous and annoying, the girl is on drugs, the pace is awful they jump from scene to scene like monkeys jump from tree to tree. The director clearly had no vision. I don't know what to say other than STAY AWAY. STAY AWAY."
"Toocooltoobefooled","Null","10","11","22 October 2016"," Disappointing
","The original was a great movie with classic actors. Sure it's dated today, but still carries it's own weight. This movie while containing some visually stunning cinematography, some how manages to just drag and drag. As others have commented it comes of like a commercial. The special affects don't seem that special. It's like you are watching a commercial with snowboarding and sky diving designed to sell Redbull. While I should be in awe at what they are doing on screen, i find myself yawning and wondering when is it all just going to end. There is no real tension building, no sense of fear that Utah will be discovered, unlike the original, where his cover was about to be blown with each scene. I highly recommend passing on this one, it's a borefest."
"billygoat1071","Null","64","89","18 December 2015"," Pointless Retreads
","The original Point Break was mostly known for its memorable bromance between Utah and Bodhi and some of its greatest action scenes ever put to film. Either way, this remake doesn't bring enough justice to the cult classic. Its new approach, instead of a simple undercover cop thriller, is now a globe-trotting adventure featuring daredevils who are pulling off a grand stunt show. Though the stunts are impressive at times, it still pales in comparison with the original. The characters are bland, the plot makes no sense and every moment it tries to replicate with the original is just painfully forced for the sake of what they believe it's called ""fan service."" Therefore, there isn't much reason for Point Break (2015) to exist.<br/><br/>So Point Break is now about the stunts, but just like most action movies today, it also had to strip away personality. So whenever we see the cops, and even the daredevils, interact, it's just not so entertaining. One of the charms of the original, while it had some great action sequences, even the characters are interesting to watch. Even if it's trifle, it's still worth spending your time. Now, it somehow becomes uninteresting filler, especially the love interest. Remember when Utah had to lie about his backstory to earn her trust? Well, now they just easily hook up and nothing else, until some twist happens or something like that. Utah and Bodhi aren't as engaging, either. They're mostly spewing exposition, while Bodhi is basically acting like a parody of someone from a New Age religion. Their intention of becoming Robin Hoods is kind of vague as well, but I guess no one thinks it actually matters.<br/><br/>What's really worth groaning is when it's really trying to replicate the original; not by heart or personality, but by scene. They did the Ex- Presidents, even though one of them is wearing an Obama mask despite of taking place in 2015, but they only did it once, probably because there isn't much room for this fan service. Also the iconic scene involving Utah shooting up the air, which apparently Hot Fuzz did it better. And the epilogue is horrendously shoehorned, like it's nothing more than a tip off the hat, because... it's not Point Break without it, I guess?<br/><br/>However, there are some things to at least like in this film. The action is kind of stunning; the fact that they're visually more realistic to look at than most CG-fest that blockbusters tend to feed us (except for the epilogue which is too obvious.) Maybe the best among them is the rock climbing sequence where it goes from wide shots to dirty hand shots of seeing how much they'd grip. Luke Bracey isn't quite bad as an action hero, but he seriously needs a better material than this. Edgar Ramirez is probably just stuck with a blandly written Bodhi and really stays stick-in-the-mud with whatever he says about nature. Ray Winstone, though a good actor, is just not the memorably delightful Papas that Gary Busey established. And the movie wouldn't be any different if Teresa Palmer's role was written off.<br/><br/>And Point Break (2015) is just another needless remake. There are ideas that could have been utilized more, but it's too burdened by both action movie clichés and the fact that it is being Point Break. It's not a good undercover cop thriller, nor a good bromantic film. And you better off watching an actual stunt show, which at least doesn't make you get through to its drab expositions and the fact that it's more real and not embellished by any special effects. Then again, the effects aren't bad, but that's not the point. You may give it credit for heightening something from the original, but it doesn't do that well either. The fact how unnatural the homages are made for this remake makes it even more frustrating to watch."

","Point break (the 2015 remake) is the single worse remake in the history of remakes. The original point break was a solid B rated movie making this remake at best an F. I mean I've seen a lot of remakes and this is the worst movie I've ever seen. In fact I honestly felt relieved when the credits started rolling. Its funny because they want ten lines just to leave a review. While I could see this working on the average movie this doesn't not work for Point Break (2015). The movie is so bad there's few words that can express this. I feel like a teacher is wanting me to write something positive about the end of the world. There is nothing positive about it or this movie. On the plus side I've drug this on to the ten required lines and I can put the movie behind me and pretend I didn't waste part of my life watching it. Its too late for me, but please save yourself and don't watch this movie."
"alindsay-al","2","11","13","10 December 2016"," A really bad reboot that is a shadow of its former friend
","I am a huge fan of the original point break made in 1991 and now I have seen the 2016 reboot and boy this is one of the worst films of the year and one of the worst reboots ever. The premise of the film sees a young up and coming FBI agent looking to infiltrate a gang of extreme athletes who may also be criminals. Luke bracey plays johnny Utah in this film and this is potentially one of the most stoic characters of the year and you will not care about him at all. His character is just so uninteresting that it really kills every scene that he is involved in. Edgar Ramirez plays bowdie in this film and just like bracey he is very stoic and isn't an interesting character like his previous incarnation. He is just your generic bad guy that Doesn't have any of the depth to him that you want him too. Also their chemistry Together just doesn't work and you just really do not buy it at all. The rest of bowdies crew were just as boring as he was and you won't care about there relationships with Utah as the film develops. The only performances I liked were ray winstone and Utah's police captain who I thought were both decent additions but they aren't given enough to do in this film for you to really care. The story is completely non existent, it is less compelling because the characters and their relationships are so dull and unbelievable that you will not care about anybody or anything in the film. The script has absolutely no depth to it and none of the dialogue was gripping in anyway. The style had some really cool extreme sports that are really well filmed but I don't need to watch this film to watch to watch good extreme sports so it needs to do more an the film just doesn't do anything more. Overall this film is definitely not worth a watch and go and watch the original point break because it is so good."

","Sometimes mere words cannot describe something adequately, and in the case of 2015's utterly pointless and mind dumbing/daft Point Break remake there are quite literally no words I can summon from the shelves of my undoubtedly mediocre storage system of the English language to pinpoint just how idiotic, stupid and unintentionally hilarious this film is.<br/><br/>Making Kathryn Bigalow's well-liked 1991 original seem like a work of Shakespeare, Ericson Core's update of the relatively simple story of fun-loving FBI agent Johnny Utah infiltrating a group of extreme sports enthusiasts that happen to be criminals is here turned into some type of ""giving back to nature"" eco conscious athletes that just happen to like messing with the rich corporations ruining mother nature (don't even try to understand the Osaki 8 that keeps popping up here) and Johnny Utah is turned into a clearly Australian, motocross riding, badly tattooed (seriously how many tattooed people can be in one movie?) agent that gets to to be involved in one of the most hilarious on screen deaths in some time (in the film's opening 5 minutes!) and somehow possesses even less charisma than Keanu Reeves (yes, the unthinkable has occurred). But if you think lame motocross related deaths and dodgy eco warriors are the worst of this films problems, then think again.<br/><br/>Director Core and his team seemingly sat down at a table and in the space of 30 or so minutes designed a serious of supposedly breathtaking stunts that span the globe and while they look great in a location sense, the actual transpiring of events are so downright unbelievable that any sense of fun or excitement is taken away by the fact it's just too daft to care.<br/><br/>From downhill snowboarding, random unnecessarily dangerous rock climbing, perfectly used wing suit fly byes, an exploding rock strewn mountain face and perhaps worst of all, a reimaging of the wave clad finale of the original, Point Break seems intent on becoming some type of hybrid of Fast and the Furious but forgets to make sure that the occurrences happening here are indeed fun and frenetic, rather than overdone and frequently unengaging.<br/><br/>At the end of the day one could go on and one about the many failures of Point Break but none of it comes as a surprise, as from the moment this remake was announced and then from the very first glimpses of the films atrocious trailer no one expected this waste of $100 million dollars plus to be anything more than a disposable piece of Hollywood trash. With no heart, no soul and with a bunch of uninvolving characters, this film is a waste of time that gets a bonus mark for its intrigue factor as a solidified sunken ship, it's just a shame it took down two up and coming Australian actors in the form of Luke Bracey and Teresa Palmer with it.<br/><br/>1 mink blanket out of 5"

","Based on the motion Picture Point Break (1991)? Well yeah, by name and character-names. Every time I heard names like Bodhi on Utah I wanted to hurl. Why was this movie made? It's got a lot of action, but everyone who has seen original Point Break is disgusted by this movie. The group who was robbing banks in the original, ""the dead presidents"" are Eco warriors in the new movie ""freeing"" money instead of robbing it. Characters Utah and Bodhi never bond like in the original movie and it makes the whole experience shallow and meaningless. The girl Utah falls in the original, is an mentor and a teacher to Utah, and in the new movie she is just a junkie. <br/><br/>Point Break 2015 should've been a movie called Adrenaline Rush with different character-names.

"Likes_Ninjas90","1","32","45","7 January 2016"," It's a black eye to the fans of the original who might have given this disaster a chance
","Point Break marks another blockbuster fizzer from Warner Bros., who after several flops is now in desperate need of a major hit. This is a useless, money-grabbing exercise that rides the name of an already overrated cult film as an excuse to stage pointless stunts. I'll say this once: do not waste your money on this film. If you are a fan of the original Point Break by Kathryn Bigelow, the film where Patrick Swayze played a bank robbing surfer who took Keanu 'I am an FBI agent' Reeves under his wing, watch that film again. If you are in the mood for crazy stunts and set pieces, open YouTube and watch some extreme sports videos on there. These are comparatively sound alternatives to this dreck, courtesy of director Ericson Core who has made his first film since 2006. It might take another nine years and extensive therapy to overcome this stain. The film is so bad and amateurishly composed that it appears someone first listed off a series of extreme stunts and told Core and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (Salt) to write the movie around them no matter how jarring or ill-fitting they may seem. If you're still wondering, the stunts don't work on their own because the script's lousiness makes them boring since there's no investment in the one- dimensional characters and the weak performances of the actors.<br/><br/>No thought went into planning this narrative. It starts with two motocross riders jumping between rock faces. One of them is Utah (Australian actor Luke Bracey), who watches as his friend falls to his death. The film forwards seven years to when Utah has joined the FBI and is under the watch of Instructor Hall (Delroy Lindo), who doubts Utah's commitment and calls him son a lot. Since Utah was once a motocross rider in the extreme sports circle, he magically has the background information about the activity of the dangerous gang of extreme sports criminals Hall is chasing. It's mega stupid and as contrived as the stunts themselves. The gang, best described as a hodgepodge of philosophers, hippies, extremists and Mountain Dew sports stars, is performing a ritual called the Osaki 8. The Osaki 8 involves eight different extreme sports trials, some of which are criminal activities but others are plain stunts including surfing and mountain climbing. The transition between these set pieces is embarrassing. When Utah bombs out in an early surfing attempt, the gang saves him from drowning by bringing him onto their boat. He's recognised as a famous motocross rider from all those years ago but everyone, at least at this point, is oblivious that this not-exactly-inconspicuous surfer dude has been training as a cop and is allowed to freely explore the boat of the gang leader Bodhi (Joy's Édgar Ramírez). The other members of the gang, including Teresa Palmer as a brief love interest, barely register at all so you won't give two hoots about them and they aren't even smart enough to background check Utah before initiating him. More criminal than the stunts is how Ray Winston as Utah's partner Pappas, a potentially good replacement for Gary Busey's comic relief character, is inconsequential through much of the film except when questioning if Utah is overly enjoying the gang life. But since we don't care about the other gang members, what's the point in blurring the two lines of the law?<br/><br/>Does every blockbuster have to be self-serious now because it worked so well in the Nolan Batman films? Whereas Bigelow's film meshed action and comedy, this remake doesn't have a funny side at all. Instead, Bodhi's long, boring monologues about giving back to the earth (what?) are serious delusions this film has about becoming meaningful. But even watching the film solely for the stunts is futile. The film's marketing has emphasised how the stunts are performed by actual stuntmen as opposed to employing special effects. But given the stunts often have nothing to do with the gang's criminal activities, like the surfing, gliding and snowboarding sequences, we're watching a stunt showcase that's completely aloof from the plot. Similarly, the apparent realism of the stunts is malarkey since some are about as plausible as a Looney Tune's cartoon. Driving down mountain slopes ahead of an avalanche, through a dense forest on bikes and climbing mountains with just his bare hands will make you think that the FBI has really intensified its training or Utah has spent a lot of time with the Avengers. The only good things about the film are its brief reference to the bank robber masks of the original and that this boring pile falls under the two hour mark. It's a small victory for anyone who is foolish enough to pay money to see it. I lied and will reiterate: don't pay money to see this because you're only encouraging movies like this with boring action and such carelessness towards the story. It's a black eye to the fans of the original who might have given this disaster a chance."

His boss Hall (Delroy Lindo) sends him to investigate a series of elaborate heists from a gang who behave like Robin Hood robbers.<br/><br/>Utah believes that the group are taking part in the Ozaki 8, eight spiritually extreme sport challenges that coincide with the daring robberies. Utah infiltrates the gang which is led by Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez.)<br/><br/>In its own right the film starts brightly enough with plenty of CGI enhanced action but later on the film actually comes to a stop in the non action sequences when the characters just talk. The film then becomes boring and after a while even the action scenes just get duller. The colour grading is awful making the film look cheap despite the international locations.<br/><br/>The original Point Break directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who would go on to become the first female Oscar winning director found a zeitgeist of Generation X sports action thriller with well staged action sequences. Although not the greatest actors around, Bigelow got charismatic turns from Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze and sturdy support from Gary Busey as Reeves FBI boss.<br/><br/>The remake lacks all of this even though it tried to go on a new direction.

","Wow, can anybody say ""product placement""? Absolutely terrible. Just as I thought it would be. This poor take on the classic is a complete travesty in every way possible; essentially it's a shameless extended Red Bull or GoPro commercial. In every frame there's an outdoor equipment or extreme sports brand in full view, front and center. There's really no plot to speak of, I think there's something about an FBI agent trying catch some bad guys, and that's about it. Even the main character seems to forget WTF he's supposed to be doing. For a bit in the middle I really did forget what the hell he was supposed to be doing. It's really a poor excuse to film beautiful young people doing dangerous sports. The acting is nonexistent and even when there is some acting, it's horrific to say the least. Now I know why Edgar Ramirez doesn't get much to say in whatever movies he's in because the guy is just terrible, he's as stiff as the rock that he throws over the cliff. To be honest I don't understand the hype around the guy. The lead guy - I don't even know who TF he is - playing Utah is an insult to the great Keanu Reeves. The lines are completely laughable, they're like lines ripped straight from Robin Sharma's The Monk who Sold His Ferrari - just some voodoo, mystic mumbojumbo about being one with the earth or some BS like that. Which is sort of ironic because they spend most of the movie ripping the earth apart with motor bikes, guns, bombs and whatever they can get their tattooed hands on. Completely pointless, avoid at all costs, watch the infinitely superior original and forget this tosh ever existed."

","When you go to the cinema to see an action movie, usually you do not expect something really engaging. Most of such productions do not appear as very original nor extraordinary. Although, from time to time, we can also find some surprising scores, wchich rebuild our ruined fate in greedy Hollywood producers. They go down into our memory. Many times, we want to re-watch them again, again and again one more time. One of such movies is Kathryn Bigelow's Point Break"" from 1999. Unfortunately, same words can't be said about the Core's <br/><br/>Newest Point Break"" by Ericson Core is such a schematic and predictable, as every movie created only for visual effects, wchich have been so important for screenwriters. However, the plot seems to be only a minor supplement. Who cares, right? So, what do we get here? A threadbare story, wchich tries to stole as much as it's possible from the original. Young FBI agent, with embarrassing past, must infiltrate the mysterious organization suspected of many crimes, committed with the help of their amazing sport skills. Do you fill familiar with this description? By replacing some words, you could easily come with a conclusion that many action movies are the same, for example The Fast and the Furious"" and also Bigelow's Point Break"". Thanks to the forceful action sequence pictures and technics how they were taken, we may partly forget about mediocre plot. It looks like, Core hasn't known about that. And he probably still doesn't. Because of that, his Point Break"" is more condensed around crass plot, rather than around extreme sports.<br/><br/>Such things like crazy and dangerous stunts on surfboards and snowboards, motocross rides and jumps from planes have been reduced to minimum. These are a few scenes, wchich have turned out really all right. It shouldn't be a big surprise, because Core was a director of photography at such productions as The Fast and the Furious"" and 2003's Daredevil"", what gave him a necessary experience in this field. Although, it doesn't mean, that he should have neglected all the other features of the movie like good plot or characters. All of these features are only the caricatures of their archetypes from 1999, without any natures, starred by the stiff actors. They look more like the sect of insane ecologists, rather than a division of athletes.<br/><br/>New version of Point Break"" ignores every kind of basic elements of good movie: well-written plot, interesting characters and most of all a dynamic action. It's one of the worst kind of productions, wchich creators hopped that, a few good action scenes would build up the whole film. Unfortunately, they were mistaken. It doesn't work like this."

","""Point Break"" is what ""Crusty Demons"" ought to be. Unfortunately, it is not what ""Point Break"" ought to be. <br/><br/>In fairness, the extreme sports scenes are pretty awesome. The cinematography is crystal-clear and the exotic locations are picturesque. As an extreme sports video, it excels. <br/><br/>As an action movie or caper, it is less impressive. <br/><br/>The greatest problem is that none of the characters are particularly likable or charismatic. Personally, I think one major problem is the horrendous tattoos that most of the central characters sport over much of their bodies. Having worked as a photographer and cinematographer, I am no fan of tattoos. To me, they suggest low-class, criminal background, lack of self-respect and many other negative character traits. There are some tattoos that are inoffensive, even impressive – but not in this movie. When I see these tattoos, my first reaction is that I have never been that drunk or that stupid or uncultured. <br/><br/>In the original, Bodhi's crew had goals and motives that made sense. Here, we have a group of athletes with improbable skills, all of whom share an exotic philosophy and a disdain for profit. The surf Nazi red herrings are gone, as is Utah's need to acquire skills in order to join the group. The whole Utah-Bodhi bromance seems less credible and less compelling. The antagonists are cast as eco-warriors; however, somehow it doesn't make them sympathetic. They are financed by an eccentric multi-billionaire, which seems more contrived than organic. <br/><br/>At one point, the FBI had very strict standards for its agents. They were expected to dress and conduct themselves in conformance with relatively conservative standards. The notion that the FBI would accept a long-haired, extensively tattooed candidate stretches credulity to the limits, as does much of the rest of the film. However, as a direct-to-video extreme sports video, it would be quite impressive."

","So many terrible reviews! Why such negativity? I've seen this film 9 times and counting. It's so beautiful. It's cinematic poetry! Point Break is a cautionary tale because the eco-warriors rebellion only leads to destruction of others and self. It's the paradox of humankind - good and wicked all in one. Please watch with an open mind! <br/><br/>Also, I find the extreme-sports-nature sequences breathtaking and beautiful and full of high energy action. There are also some inspiring ideals along the way: ""the break point, the point where fear becomes master and you the slave..."" <br/><br/>I understand Core's approach and Kurt Wimmer's screen-writing logic: a story of friendship with a crazy philosophical twist and rebellion turned into criminal. The natural wonders are fantastic! Huge surf waves, Alps, and Angel Falls. <br/><br/>Yes I'm biased... I'm from Venezuela, and I think Edgard Ramirez did a spectacular job with his character and Angel Falls are magnificent! Luke Bracey as Johnny Utah is heartfelt and charismatic. Roach, Chowder, Grommet, Pappas, and Samsara were great too. All straightforward and minimal dialogue. <br/><br/>Did you know that the climbing of Auyantepui was real? The line and bolts were digitized out, but it was and experience of a lifetime for these climbers. Chris Sharma, Peter Croft, and Dany Andrada were the stunt doubles. The behind-the-scenes video is astounding! <br/><br/>One big mistake? To have marketed this movie as a remake of Point Break 1991: it's inspired by it but another story. And yes, there are problems with the plot and character development, but that's because the focus is on the visual story more than dialogue. Another major problem is that the writing and the dialogue lines are too abstract and metaphoric and ambiguous. It's not clear at times what Bodhi means or what Johnny Utah wants. I think I got it and I enjoyed the film, but I can see how it can be confusing to audiences. Teresa Palmer's lines too are full of philosophical ideas that sound abstract as well. <br/><br/>In this version, Bodhi is a protégé of Osaki, a fictionalized eco-warrior with the idea of saving Earth by performing 8 ordeals (this is the fiction). But Osaki was killed by a whaling ship when he was ""giving back""... Later, Bodhi follows Osaki's steps, but he has taken the wrong path. Bohdi wants to accomplish his 8-ordeals to become one with the Earth and give back through criminal/sabotage acts. However, there's good in Bodhi, for he saves Utah's life for some unknown compassionate reason(??). Perhaps Osaki saved Bodhi's life once just like in Utah's situation? It would've been great to see the setup story for Bodhi as well. Yet, Bodhi is determined and he doesn't care he is killing people and destroying assets when he ""gives back to Earth.""<br/><br/>Without the crime, these guys would be extreme-sports crusaders for mother Earth's wonders: which would be a whole different story - perhaps I'll write a new Point Break screenplay inspired by this version of Point Break (I'm a screen writing student). <br/><br/>Then we have Johnny Utah, a former extreme-sports turned FBI agent, but we don't learn why he specifically joins the FBI. The film would have benefited from additional minutes to set up the characters better and explore their deeper emotional motives. That's what's lacking. Utah goes undercover to find out why these extreme-athletes are committing crimes, only to get too involved to be able to stop them: part of Utah relishes in the chaos and he enters into a conflict with himself. Utah however, is the perfect agent to pursue the extreme-sports criminals. But his longing for the sport and his gratitude to Bodhi are stronger than his FBI mission. And worse yet for the mission: Utah has a soft-heart and Bodhi knows that. Utah owes him his life. Utah is in a great dilemma - apprehend and kill the very person that saved his life?<br/><br/>In the end, the power of gratitude and kindness prevails in Utah. And he gets back his passion for life. And the bad guys find their fate...<br/><br/>Enjoy. Best wishes."

","In 1992 (or there about) there was a fairly decent move called Point Break. This version is loosely based on the earlier one. But the basis is only that the characters have the same names. Point Break is an action film best suited for testosterone-charged teen boys. The plot goes nowhere. The acting is weak (at best). The film's attempt to attach a philosophy to the extreme sports is juvenile at best. Point Break is too loud. There were too many tattoos. The FBI does not really run independent international operations. On the positive side (yes there is one--barely), the 3D photography is spectacular. The extreme sports scenes are impressive. If it weren't for the photography, I'd rate this film 0. The last 3D film I saw was Friday the 13th, Part 3. It's plot was no worse than that of Point Break. The real star of the film is the 3D photography. It is a shame that a better plot could not have been found. Lacking that, making an extreme sports documentary of the sports scenes would have resulted in a much more enjoyable film."

","OK, so last night was the annual Lucia Movie Night here in Sweden, where SF (Swedish Filmindustry) do their part to keep the kids away from the streets during Lucia Wake. They do this by having a drug- and alcohol free all-night event at their cinemas all across the country. For 295 SEK (app. $40-45) you get popcorn, soda, a few other refreshments AND three undisclosed previews of films yet to open in theaters. Where I live, in Umeå, they NEVER tell you the name of the movie beforehand. You have to wait and see for yourself when the title pops up on the screen.<br/><br/>You can bet everyone wanted Star Wars, but everyone also knew that wasn't going to happen.<br/><br/>The last film of the night, starting at about 05.15 in the morning, was this one, Point Break. I was all excited when I realized what it was (which was right at the start, when one character calls another character 'Utah'). But my excitement checked out and went home to catch some well needed z's pretty quickly.<br/><br/>The plot is somewhat different to the original, mostly the changes revolve around the bad guys and their reasoning for doing what they are doing, but also around the character Utah, and his background. It is also glossier (if you know what I mean), much of this is due to the 3D-effect, which is prominent and very much in your face - but also creates a feeling of nothing being done for real...something I know isn't true. A lot of the stunts were if not 100% real, then at least close to 100%. But the 3D makes it all look fake somehow... I tried removing the 3D effect occasionally - by closing one eye - and it really did look a lot better without it.<br/><br/>The biggest change from Kathryn Bigelows modern-classic-original however is the fact that this version doesn't make me care about the characters...at all! It borrows a few iconic scenes (most prominently the ""angrily shooting into the air""-scene and the ending...sort of) and it makes no excuse whatsoever about cramming these images into the film. It tries SO hard to make audiences go 'Ooo, did you see what they did there! That is from the original that is!', but as this film is so infuriatingly inferior (say that quickly five times) it only makes me a little bit angry, that it didn't even have the guts to stand on its own two legs as a modern day action movie.<br/><br/>If you plan on seeing this in the theater, but have never seen the original, Make sure you do see that one as well! But in this case I dare to say it doesn't matter if you see it before or after you see this remake, because no matter what you WILL see that this is nothing but a cash in on on of the best action movies of the 90's."

But where it fails, and it does so very badly, is in the story, the acting, and especially the editing<br/><br/>Recall the original - Patrick Swayze plays the surfer and Kenau Reeves is the quarterback, along with Gary Busey before he got into the motorcycle accident. Then there was fragile Lori Petty who played ""the girl"". All 4 of these actors did memorable jobs in the 1991 version, but here in 2015, only Ray Winstone adds a bit of showmanship.<br/><br/>The current version instead of being US centric is Euro centric, which I guess someone figured out might make more money but doesn't make for a better film. The film's star and most of the cast were unknown to me, which isn't necessarily bad if they bring something to the table. I thought they didn't.<br/><br/>But worst of all is the editing. What must have been incredible stunts are reduced to edited pieces so that the true nature of the stunt is never captured. By doing quick edits the story lacks the true impact of the stunts, and could have been done on a sound stage in some cases. Here is one film in which long takes would have been mandatory, but they are rare."

As one of them says, ""we all will die. The question is how"". They are outsiders. They would never be able to live a ""life"" of routine, office-home-bills. They do not like this system and they show it with a series of no-killing crimes on the ""Robin Hood"" style, like stealing money from a Plane and making it fall down so that people can take it (it's on the trailer, no spoiling here). ""Giving it back"", they say. They do indeed also make profit in order to finance their next extreme activities. But they never steal from poor people. Only from the system. So, they have a moral, THEIR moral, which is neither black nor white. But they are not ""evil"". That's why the FBI agent, who is sent to infiltrate them, is somehow fascinated by them and for a while cannot understand anymore on which side he is.<br/><br/>Anyway, they are not ""good"" either. You can feel that there is something dark, in their way of playing with death there on the edge, pursuing the legendary (apparently fictional) Osaki 8 deadly challenges. And when they put the life of innocent people in danger, the FBI agent finally takes part.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is a downward spiral of destruction and self- destruction. They know they have no way out and they just push the accelerator more and more, to die as lions.<br/><br/>You may not agree with their choices, and it is not aim of the film to make you agree or disagree.<br/><br/>The film just tells the story of this group of people, and it tells it quite well. It is not a Masterpiece but it is entertaining and if you ever felt that living is more about being alive than about surviving, this movie can make you care about the characters and their pursuit of feeling ALIVE. No matter if you agree or not with how they realize it.<br/><br/>I think it's pointless to compare it with the previous version, because they are different and both valid.

Out of all the significant FBI characters, and the four members of the extreme athlete group, not one is female. This is America. It's 2016. Give me a break. This movie perpetuates the message to its young viewers that men are the great athletes while women are peripheral, staying home to party and make salad and screw the men.<br/><br/>Reason 2: The athlete group follows an extremist ideology that they will wantonly end innocent human lives to advance... hmmm sound familiar? In the present day with ISIS at large and abortion clinics getting blown up, it is totally outrageous to make us root for characters who are basically terrorists. And of course we root for them because they are hot and have awesome powers and we all vaguely agree with their goal of ""giving back to mother earth"".<br/><br/>Media shapes people's opinions; this movie has two main messages for the American public: Men do great things and women shake their asses. And, it's OK to kill innocent people who are associated with an institution you oppose, as long as you have a sexy accent and rippling muscles.<br/><br/>Totally, completely offensive and anger-making."

","Before i start i would like to explain this is a 2 part review. Part 1 If this was a stand alone original film then this would be a great watch as there is plenty of action and a adrenaline junkie fuelled film, plot is a basic undercover operation that devolps into a mutual friendship with some great screen shots and good acting, point break would be getting a good score if it was original.<br/><br/>Part 2 Why do directors and Hollywood constantly insist on remaking films that are classics and should not be re-done?? The original point break from 1991 is a movie that was brilliant in 1991 and still is 24 years later in 2015 this remake is awful!! Luke bracey (johnny utah) and edgar ramirez (bodhi) is strange as ramirez should of played (utah) and bracey as (bodhi) you will understand when you watch it. I don't see this film doing well at all and quite honestly its offensive to the late great Patrick swayze at how bad this film is.<br/><br/>Hollywood here is a tip.....if a film is a classic and enjoyed by millions then leave it alone, stop remaking and rebooting just for a cash injection."

This is not Shakespeare, so I was not expecting Oscar worthy performances. It delivered what I expected, and even found a way to keep the ending of the original film intact and even more visually stunning.

And the supporting actors you do know (like Ray Winston) have no substance any more from numerous poor movie castings, I see pay cheque over passion, have some integrity guys! To have made a worthy remake extreme care should have been made when casting. Yes, Keanu's lack of charisma in the original is undeniable, but this only adds to his believable character as an FBI agent and creates some great character development. The main character in the remake is unconvincing, I mean - an ex-motocross rider with total disregard for safety who basically killed his friend does not strike me as someone who would want to be a police officer. He's already portrayed as a bad-ass (unconvincingly) so has no development through the movie and the acting left me with a hollow feeling of disappointment.<br/><br/>Bodhi - new vs old: ""Bodhi"" was a word that, when heard, sent me to a warm and comforting place with memories of Swayze, with his sun bleached hair striding through hot desert, or everlasting quotes like ""Yo Johnny, See you in the next life"", life changing! No, really, this character changed my life, he is the ultimate anti-establishment bad-ass! Now, not so much. Thank you arrogant French sounding nobody for ruining my life!

Putting aside that the actors playing the two leads of the new version didn't stand a chance pitted against Swayze and Reeves, as i said the portrayal of Reeves in this version is cringe worthy (poor actor) but Swayze's character in this version is actually a good portrayal to some extent. The stories are basically the same, apart from a couple of small changes so i have no idea why people are saying that this remake is not a remake?!

","Anyone rating this movie higher than 5 stars is just being generous, have low standards, or don't appreciate basic movie making principles. I will list these principles and how this movie measures up in each of them<br/><br/>1. Acting- Acting brings you into the story and make you care about the characters and the story. In this movie the acting is cool and stale. You don't care about these characters and the larger story because of there poor acting. I see better acting in video game cut scenes regularly.<br/><br/>2. Plot - Point Break has an interesting story-line but the story telling is hindered by the acting and the pure focus on action scenes instead of character development. The original Point Break was good because philosophically there were no bad guys and seeing either side ""lose"" in a way made you feel bad. In the end you don't pay attention to this 2015 version's dialogue enough due to the bad acting to feel anything or understand the philosophy fluidly as the movie progresses<br/><br/>3. Visual - This movie is visually stunning but that does not make a movie it makes a good commercial, documentary of extreme sports, or a good demo video for new Digital Video Display Technology. But in modern Hollywood visual excellence is probably the easiest thing to get right so in my opinion it is clearly over rated in its impact to this movie's average rating on IMDb.com.<br/><br/>Summary, this movie is a total waste of time and Hollywood resources. Without the visual impact this is a walk out worthy movie. If truly want a great visual experience only then it my be worth your time but there too many other great movies, documentaries and other media sources that provide an equally great visual experience. Exhaust those other options before wasting time watching this."
"leonblackwood","3","2","2","25 August 2016"," Terrible Remake! 3/10
","Review: I've always said that some films should definitely not be remade, and this is definitely one of them! Luke Brace (Utah), definitely didn't have the screen charisma as Keanu Reeves had in the original movie and Edgar Ramirez (Bodhi), was not in the same league as Patrick Swayze. The storyline was also pretty poor but I liked Ray Winstone (Pappas) and Delroy Lindo (Instructor Hall), even though they wasn't in the film that much. The director seemed to concentrate on the stunts more than the actual storyline and the film lacked emotion and purpose. As this movie went down well with audiences on it's first release, making nearly $85million at the box office, the director should have used A Class actors, except for these unknown actors, who weren't that great. On the plus side, some of the stunts were original and executed quite well, which did bring some intensity to the project but Bodhi seemed to waffle on most of the time and Utah wasn't a convincing adrenaline junkie. I personally think that most of the money that was made at the box office, was basically due to the popularity of the first movie, and not because this movie was any good. Anyway, I did have high hopes for this film but like many other remakes, it just turned out to be a big let down. Disappointing!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This movie was directed by Ericson Core, whose only other credit for the big screen is Invincible in 2006, starring Mark Wahlberg. You can tell that this movie was made by a director who hasn't had that much experience behind the camera, because he didn't bring important elements to the movie, like suspense, drama and a couple of twists, which this movie certainly needed. He is known for his cinematography skills, in movies like Payback, The Fast and the Furious and Daredevil, and you can't fault the cinematography in this movie but the script needed a lot more work and the actors didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>Budget: $105million Worldwide Gross: $134million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their sport/action/crime movies starring Edgar Ramirez, Luke Bracey, Ray Winstone, Teresa Palmer, Delroy Lindo, Matias Varela and Clemens Schick. 3/10"

Yet the greenish over-sharped image, chosen by Ericson Core who serves both as the director and as cinematographer, dilutes their majestic natural appearance and makes them look artificial.<br/><br/>The movie also talks, in the beginning, about nirvana and spiritual enlightenment but in the end fails to emit such feelings towards the viewers.<br/><br/>So is it bad? Well no I wouldn't say that. it us a totally different beast. More raw, even more dramatic but with far less wit and charisma.<br/><br/>The cast isn't stellar.

","Point Break (2015) is not a reboot, prequel or sequel of the movie from 1991. The basic premise of this version was: let's take few clutch scenes an characters from the original (Utah, Bodhi, 'I'm an FBI agent', robbers in presidents masks, protagonist shooting at the sky and screaming, surfing, etc), let's build a slightly upgraded story around the original premise and fit it into today's market (so basically dumb it down and make it PG13). What we get in result is rushed plot revolving around the group of people with death wish trying to accomplish their questionable goals.<br/><br/>The plot is rushed and dumbed down beyond belief. Remember that slow build up in the first movie? Those conversations between Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze and Gary Busey? This slow and methodic infiltration of the surfers community? Forget about that. New Utah is some stuntman that can easily achieve the most impossible task on this planet and he gets straight to the point in like first 10 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Acting? Let's be honest, the original wasn't that great. It was mediocre / not bad and sometimes flat out cheesy. In 2015 version we have similarly flat performances. Nothing memorable or horribly bad.<br/><br/>Action sequences feel like a commercial for all of that sport gear that our protagonists are using. Surfboards, motorbikes, wingsuits... And those sequences feel oddly out of place. It's like few minutes of boring conversations that have no meaning, heart or reason behind them and then 10 minutes of few guys flying downhill in their wingsuits. All that time you feel like 'cool, can we get to the point?' And I don't believe that this movie sends a good message in general. It's like a celebration of dangerous behaviour. Few stuntmen with death wish trying to complete an impossible and really weird task (spoilers - all of them die in the process, so good job).<br/><br/>Some people say that this movie would work just fine if it had different title. I have to disagree. You must have something to sell this kind of low impact, totally average action movie. Nostalgia is a good seller. And while it didn't completely disappoint, it wasn't good either. But at least it's watchable...<br/><br/>5/10"

"OldManCodger","9","23","49","3 December 2015"," Got what I wanted. Solid action flick.
","My attitude changed very quickly watching this ""remake"". First, I was surprised (pleasantly) with some new fresh faces on the screen. OK, maybe they don't have their full acting ""chops"" yet, but they do a very nice job of building decent characters and showing the tension and caring in their relationships. Luke Bracey, does a nice job with Johnny Utah and is sure to be the new heart throb for the ladies. I have a hard time with Edgar Ramirez, who struggles a bit with Bodhi, but he comes across well when it counts.<br/><br/>I thought the storyline actually tries hard to provide a fresh take on the original, but it probably tries a little too hard. The plot gets outlandish in places and veers away from the original, but gets a B+ for making the effort and ties it up OK at the end. It's pretty much what you would want in a hard core action movie. I will say there are a couple of romantic twists and turns that prove eventually to be fairly arresting.<br/><br/>But there is one area where this movie just blew the original away. The extreme sports scenes are almost shocking. One scene literally felt like I was in it and had me totally freaked out it was so frightening. Let's just say it's a skydiving sequence that unless you are an extreme athlete, you think something has gone very, very, wrong. The surfing scenes may be the best thing about the movie in itself. There is something about 80 ft. waves and those that ride them that evokes a kind of primal majesty. And then of course there is a rock climbing scene that is still giving me nightmares.<br/><br/>The bottom line here is that this Point Break is it's own movie. Yes, it borrows from the original, and uses the name, but that really doesn't even factor in here. This is Point Break for 2015 and it works for me. The new actors and the insane extreme sport sequences taken together puts it's own shine on what we remember as a great movie, and makes it better."
"BigHushtheRapper","3","9","16","16 January 2016"," Tough to sit through.
","This movie lacked heart as well as any connection to the characters. Utah already being a known adrenaline junkie and extreme sports athlete leaves nothing left to develop with the lead character. He is just a bro with a badge hanging out with bros without one. Pappas served almost no purpose in this version, they might as well have written his character out completely instead of having him appear as an after thought on screen.<br/><br/>The color grading effect of increasing blues/greens while minimizing warm colors is all wrong for this film. Everyone looked like they had the flu most of the time. The stunts and location shots were pretty cool, but wasted on a film that desperately needed more substance if it wanted to prove better than the original Point Break. The acting was flat and the storyline was paper thin in my opinion.<br/><br/>YES, I love the original, but I gave this one a fair shot in hopes that it would impress me. It didn't. The original wasn't an Oscar picture, but it had so much heart and spirit in it you'd think it was a member of Bodhi's crew."

The actors seemed stiff and Johnny Utah seemed more fun when played by Reeves. Not sure why half the stunts were needed.

","To say that this movie is bad would be wrong. It is such an epic pile of steaming horse manure that calling it bad would be an understatement. Now I really wanted to not let the original taint my rating on this movie and in all honesty, I watched it with an open mind. <br/><br/>The main issue here is that all the characters have no soul and there is no character or plot development. You have no empathy for any of the people in this movie and as a result one is just watching scenes of random action that look like cuts from other movies. The acting, like the tattoos, are bad... nay, very bad. <br/><br/>In addition, the plot is kind of given away in the first 10 minutes of the movies so there is absolutely no build up. It's like, here is the cool good guy and here are the cool bad guys who are really not bad but more like robin hoods of ""extreme sports"" (yes they use that word). The point that Bodhi was an anti-hero, someone that you hated but loved at the same time is lost here completely. This kind of screws up the dynamic of the Utah and Bodhi in the remake completely.

","""The only law that matters is gravity."" Johnny Utah (Bracey) is a former extreme sport athlete who has joined the FBI. After investigating a series of crimes he thinks that those involved live the same lifestyle he used to and it is up to him to stop them. The closer he gets to Bodhi (Ramirez), the leader the farther he falls back into his old ways and the line between agent and criminal begins to blur. This is a hard movie to review. Mainly because other than awesome stunt sequences the movie didn't know what it wanted to do. The original had an actual plot that involved bank robbers that were surfers. In that movie Utah infiltrated the group in order to stop them. This movie started off with the robbery idea, but quickly tossed it aside and forgot about it. This movie tried to become Fast and Furious, but again the plot got lost. It seemed to me the filmmakers wanted to make a movie about extreme sports and didn't worry too much about what happened in between the stunts. It did borrow form the original movie, but more in the way a book does. By that I mean you need to see the original to fill in the massive plot holes in this one for any of the story to make sense.

","The film presents a number of impressive extreme sport actions set pieces with glorious parachutes or rock-climbing gear that will certainly excite the audiences but sadly the plot with poor pacing has turned this remake slightly pointless. It manages to break the action point based on the Ozaki Eight's fictional sets of highly dangerous attempts of worshiping the nature but fail in achieving several other points, most obviously when it lacks of engagement in between the characters while the existence of political subtext and the crime concept seems to be meaningless. Performance from the casts are overall fine but the decision to focus on the extreme adventures have totally neglected the potential of some supporting characters and the emotional development that cause the romance and friendship seems to be superficial. Visual effects are environmental breathtaking and stunning, the scores by Junkie XL are strong and inspiring yet all of these are insufficient to provide additional thrills to make the film superior than the original cult in 1991."
"brendandevere","5","7","13","2 January 2016"," Point Less.
","The first mistake in the recreation of 'Point Break' is the startling realisation that Hollywood actually thought it was a good idea for a remake to be produced. Surely these fools have enough original material to stay away from projects like this. The second mistake is the absurd amount of money committed to the production of this bland, eco-environmental crime thriller, if in fact that is what it can actually be called. In saying this though, the cinema was at capacity for the reinvention of Kathryn Bigelow's original edgy crime thriller that quickly became a cult classic upon its release back in 1991. Most of the audience were there on the pretense that they were about to witness a crafty update packed with plenty of glorious thrilling action. What you actually get is a misguided film that preaches its obvious left wing message and forgets to develop any bona fide relationships between the cast. As one women stated as we were all leaving the theatre, ""I almost fell asleep"".<br/><br/>Let me start with what was right with the film. There is no doubt that the incredible locations used as a driving force to create an authentic sense of extreme, is a total eye opener. This is where the greatest slice of the reported $105 million budget has gone to. It's a National Geographics where's where of tremendous locations, showcasing the wonderfully powerful forces that mother nature has at her disposal. The audience is treated to mammoth middle ocean surf breaks, stunning scenes of snow covered mountains, and superbly scaled shots of cliff faces rising out from South American jungles. The film is NOT a wildlife documentary and this is where Director, Ericson Core, has failed in his attempt to deliver a production that has any connection with the audience. Core has been too busy in his persistence for shooting the impossibly outrageous stunts than trying to develop a consuming story. Kurt Wimmer's screenplay is not totally weak, doing its best in inviting the audience into the narrative but it just isn't strong enough to balance out the blatant overuse of the death defying skills. Unfortunately 'Point Break' just cannot make it past the first twenty minutes before you realise that this is as good as it gets.<br/><br/>Core's 'Point Break' focuses on the world of extreme sports. Motor Cross daredevil, Utah (Luke Bracy) joins the FBI after a tragic accident sees him walk away from the sport that he loves. He is recruited by his instructor, Hall (Delroy Lindo) to infiltrate the world he once belonged to. His task is to identify and investigate a gang of extreme athletes that have been responsible for some truly impossible heists that has resulted in the loss of billions of dollars. This crime gang has disrupted major American interests but any attempts to catch these fearless criminals has proved fruitless. In his investigation, Utah comes across a man of interest who goes by the name of Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez). Like Utah, Bodhi is highly skilled in all things dangerous and it isn't long before the two form an unusual bond. The young Fed becomes fixated on Bodhi and his crew and when their plans are revealed, Utah must choose between the life he once knew and the life that he wishes to pursue.<br/><br/>Along for this pointless ride is Ray Winstone as Pappas, Utah's handler while he is on assignment but it becomes obviously apparent that Winstone seems out of place in the whole context of the story. He just doesn't need to be there. Even more confusing is the role that Teresa Palmer plays. She is Utah's love interest, Samsara, but all she seems to be is a stoned hippi who has been carelessly written into the script. While the cast have tried their best to engage with their characters, none seem to have any special attachment to the other. For 'Point Break' to seize the attention of the audience, Bracey and Ramirez needed a certain chemistry to give the film an authentic feel. It all seemed too laboured. It lacked the star power of a Swayze or a Reeves to navigate the narrative through the feeble dialogue.<br/><br/>The remake of 'Point Break' didn't need to happen. If you plan to see this film based on the presumption that it could be a riveting criminal action film you will be disappointed. The stunts are spectacular and the locations are worth a look but a good reinvention it is not."

FYI: Neither one of them make a cameo in this one and it would have been extremely hard for Swayze to appear, since he has passed away. Edgar has the Swayze role of Bodhi and Luke has the Reeves role of Utah. For anyone unfamiliar with the original-Shame on you-Edgar is the leader of a group of extreme sports fanatics that have been robbing some financial market corporations and giving the loot back to the poor. They claim to be following in the footsteps of their extreme sports idol Ozaki. Ozaki had an extreme competition called the Ozaki 8, which was a list of challenges that would balance nature-don't ask me how-but even Ozaki never finished all 8 challenges-he died around number 4. Luke is a former extreme sports star-he excelled in motorcross and snowboarding-that has joined the F.B.I. and wants to earn his badge in the field. Luckily for him, a case has come up where his qualifications will come in handy, and his boss, Delroy in the Gary Busey role, puts him on the case. Luke infiltrates Edgar's gang and meets Teresa, in the Lori Petty role, and the romantic sparks start flying. The story is pretty close to the original, with extreme sports being more prominent here-sometimes, it's almost like watching a commercial for an extreme sports channel, what with all the snowboarding, wingsuit flying, free rock climbing, motorcross and surfing going on. It's not a bad movie, I just liked the original better-maybe because of Keanu, Patrick and Gary. But if you are into extreme sports, you may like it better than I did. It's rated ""PG-13"" for perilous activity, violence, drug use, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright as a rental."

Frames would jump to an unprecedented area almost abruptly, chipped right in the middle of a conversation. It is a poorly made flick that just crawls on without a point and breaks often too.<br/><br/>The only good thing about the movie was the stunt bit. All stunts were inscribed under nature's aegis. A lot of time was spent on the waves, in the mountains, mid-air, skiing that manifested sheer nature power. The eight ordeals the team was pursuing were given plenty of screen time. But it was extended too much to cover up holes movie bore throughout. Sure thing Luke Bracey looked phenomenal with his tattoos and Edgar Ramirez coolly played Bodhi to impart a different outlook to his perversion, but there was nothing they could do to uplift the poor editing and direction of Point Break.Befooled by the trailer that showed rad incessant stunts, the movie doesn't cash in on them properly either. The skydiving stunt that was sold in the teasers ends up in mediocrity. Thrilling were the afterthought shouts that would complement the uplifting music. Inclusion of Delroy Lindo seemed like an exercise in futility. If you try to look at the screenplay, there are two or three lines in the movie that are good but have been reiterated quite many times for emphasis.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, it looks like a discovery channel documentary of people that are good in extreme sports. It was more like a Pointless Break!"
"Ragnaroker","8","15","38","3 December 2015"," Taking the original and upping the ante on stunts and cinematography
","Memories of an 80's or early 90's cult classic can often cloud your  judgment when a reboot or remake comes on to the scene. I have to be  honest with myself, the original isn't a work of art and it doesn't age  well. After recently watching the 1991 version, it was obvious that my  memory of the movie was way better than the actual thing. While the  campiness and bad acting might have worked when I was a young teenager,  it now feels like a self-parody.  Let's jump to present day. It's apparent from the opening scene that  the new version of ""Point Break"" is trying to have it's own identity.  The motocross scene immediately grabs hold of you and squeezes till  your left breathless when they make their jump of the cliff. Knowing  that this is REAL stunt work and not special effects is what really  makes this a fun action movie. It's the same reason why we watch Jackie  Chan movies because we know he's putting himself on the line in his  fight and stunt sequences. People often compare fight sequences as a  dance / art. I believe that it's the same for surfing, motocross,  snowboarding and wing suit flying. And the great cinematography really  amplify those moments in the film.   When it comes to the story, I expected as much as an action movie was  going to give. I will say that the new version of Point Break tries to  create layers that were not in the original film. But the bar is low  enough that practically anything is an improvement from the original  storyline. But regardless, it kept me interested since I already knew  how the movie was going to end. The journey was slightly different for  the characters so it was fun watching a new take on it.  As for the acting, they aren't trying to reinvent Reeves or Swayze.  While that is a good thing, it also has it's drawbacks. Perhaps because  I am now ""grown up"", I don't care for the campiness and  less-than-stellar acting of the original. The new faces in this version  of the movie do a good job but they don't have the same dynamic or  charisma as Reeves or Swayze. But what they do establish a thousand  times better is their kinship. The bro-love of the original feels paper  thin but in the new movie feels organic and realistic.   Overall, this is supposed to be a fun movie to sit down with your  popcorn and just go along for the ride. I don't want it to be the  original ""Point Break"" but I'm not expecting Citizen Kane. It's an  action movie that entertains. Watching the stunt sequences alone was  worth the price of admission.

","First off, this movie was NOT a remake, let's get that clear right now. Point Break(2015) is an Extreme Sports movie, with a ""re-imagining"" of the Point Break plot thrown in. The fact that most of the Action Scenes were REAL, that alone is mind blowing. The extreme risks these guys took to film Alone was worth 10 stars. The story was typical and plain, and the acting from Utah and Bodhi were Good. If you want to see Breath Taking scenery like NOTHING ELSE, with the plot to Point Break thrown in the middle, go see this. Just don't go in with expectations, except for Tons of adrenaline junkie sports and amazing shots. It's a fun movie, and a fun ride, nothing less, nothing more."

","Just saw this movie, thought f... all the bad reviews, I'm gonna completely lower my expectations and just watch it with an open mind, without comparing it to the classic Point Break from 1991. And the result? ... I was still deeply disappointed. This movie is full of amazing images and scenery (even though you can find better looking and more impressive footage of wing suits guys here on YouTube), but without anything close to a decent script. It's not only completely unrealistic, it's also stupid and deprived of basic logic. Oh plus the acting is really bad, apart from two actors, Édgar Ramiréz and Ray Winstone.<br/><br/>The basic idea of the movie it actually cool, so I believe it could have been a really good and entertaining movie, if the acting where good, the script was good etc. But trust me this movie ain't even worth a free download on torrent sites!"

","After watching the trailer my nephew and I went to the cinema to see this film with great expectations which proved false when it gradually dawned on us how these plummeted down woefully as the story line unfolded. The plot is terribly powerless and the film is merely some sort of exaltation to a bunch of risky sports which the 4 or 5 main characters practise to excess throughout the duration of the film. Indeed a fair portion of it is dedicated to and consumed by the portrayal of spectacular yet improbable scenes of these thrill seeking sports. I must say that the visual effects are great, but the story line is glaringly deplorable. And to add insult to injury, the unfitting sudden end of the film certainly confirms its consummate deplorableness. On the whole the film wasn't worth either our time, let alone our money!"

I'm not as extreme as these redbull athletes are but I know and understand what goes through their minds and why they do it. Normal people just won't understand. That's why this movie is so awesome! It really pays respect to different extreme sports. It's more a tribute to all extreme athletes. There were so many in the film including Chris Sharma.

","​ Going into the Point Break remake I don't think I could have had any lower expectations because I am a massive fan of the original, but I came out of this movie actually quite liking it. The acting in this movie is average and the story is very predictable and cheesy at times but the stunt scenes! They are fantastic and i found I couldn't take my eyes off the screen while they were happening. Unfortunately after a stunt scene comes dialogue which with its bad timing and believability pulled me straight back out of the film, I do honestly think they should have taken the Point Break elements out of this movie and just called it something altogether fresh, then I think I would maybe hold this film a little higher. But even with all this I do think this movie was very, very enjoyable and if you just want to kick back and watch a mindless action movie this is a brilliant choice. I give Point Break (2015) a 6/10"
"Entropathe_Fou","7","10","25","5 December 2015"," Entertaining movie
","The overall quality of Point Break (2015) is good. <br/><br/>Point Break is an action movie that makes its job. No rest is accorded to the public during the whole length of the movie. An interesting point is that some of the scenes are more than just action because they take place in incredible locations of the planet.<br/><br/>However, Point Break suffers small mistakes that could have been avoided. Fast successions of short plans during the action scenes are perturbing and prevent to fully enjoy the show. Furthermore, changes of position of camera between plans lead to the feeling of being lost. Filming such amazing scenes in a more simplistic way would have been beneficial to the movie.<br/><br/>The storyline could have been more interesting. One interesting idea is the one to save the planet as the ""bad guys"" are green fighters. It creates an ambiguity as whether to consider the bad guys as bad people or not. However the effect is partially lost by the clumsiness of the screenplay. As such, the dialogues are full of lines without clear meaning.<br/><br/>This movie will clearly entertains action movie fans. It will definitely not fit to people with bad heart conditions and/or looking after the meaning of life."

","I loved the first Point Break with Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves in 1991. As with other movie updates, I was initially apprehensive. I think the director carefully kept the original themes which weave the various characters and actions together. These are the sacred nature of our planet, the need to follow your destiny and the incredible power of the moment. Flash forward to 2015, our planet is in even more serious trouble. Life is tough, people are tougher. Bodhi is now more of a man of action than previously. He still has a devoted team around him that believe in what they are doing. Almost like a crew of Vikings about to sail off the known edge of the planet. The actions scenes are out of this world, no doubt about it. I was reminded of ""Riding Giants"", ""Storm Surfers"" and ""Sunshine Superman"". These scenes make the movie and you wish you could join the athletes. Samsara is the more mystical of the crew and offsets the hard edges of the film."
"FlashCallahan","3","3","5","1 April 2016"," 9% pure adrenaline........
","Young FBI agent Johnny Utah, infiltrates a team of thrill-seeking athletes, led by charismatic Bodhi. <br/><br/>They are suspected of carrying out a spate of crimes in unusual ways. Deep undercover, and with his life in danger, Utah strives to prove they are the masterminds behind these crimes.........<br/><br/>In some random making of documentary, it is said that the film is replete with the most daring athleticism ever seen in a motion picture. Big-wave surfing, wing-suit flying, sheer- face snowboarding, free rock climbing, and high-speed motorcycling, are all evident in the film.<br/><br/>That is true, but no matter how many stunts, deft-defying acts of lunacy, and good looking people feature in a 'film' it's doesn't make up for the sheer audacity of not only remaking one of the greatest action movies ever made, but to also have one of the most incoherent, boring scripts that Hollywood has churned out in quite a while.<br/><br/>It's clear that this was never going to be intended as a remake, but when the final script was presented, the studio must have known they had a dog on their hands,so I'm guessing they got Wimmer to change the names of some of the primary characters, rename the film from 'The Real BMX Bandits', to Point Break, and they had at least a chance of recuperating some of their money from the stupidly high budget.<br/><br/>And it flopped big time both here and in the States,which is a positive to the audience, because if this was a hit, imagine the Lethal Weapon remake Starring Tom Hardy and Samuel L Jackson, or the Die Hard remake, starring Armie Hammer.<br/><br/>Lindo and Winstone are clearly here for the pay check, and Bracey and Ramireź have absolutely zero chemistry on screen. And when that relationship between the two is the foundation to make the film actually work, the film is in serious trouble.<br/><br/>Swayze and Reeves had a relationship that had an air of mysticism about it, and during the second act, you knew that he knew that he wasn't who he said he was, and it just added to the tension of an already exhilarating action film.<br/><br/>Stick with the original, it's a timeless classic, that should have been left well alone.<br/><br/>This?

"dave-mcclain","3","4","8","29 December 2015"," The ""Point Break"" redeux throws in some great extreme sports scenes in place of much of what made the original film work so well.
","When a movie works, it's due to a combination of great writing, directing, casting, acting, set design, make-up and hairstyling, costuming, lighting, cinematography, visual and sound effects, music and mood, not to mention factors like effective marketing, the timing of the film's release, and even luck and other intangibles that are virtually impossible to predict or control. When enough of those elements produce a film that most people like (or, a few people love), it's like a bit of magic. Trying to duplicate that feat is extremely difficult, yet filmmakers still insist on remaking movies that came out well the first time. Remakes rarely, if ever, recapture that magic of the original film. After a quick IMDb.com search of titles from various genres and decades that have been remade, I found very few remakes which rate higher than their predecessors. I believe that 2015's ""Point Break"" (PG-13, 1:53) similarly falls short.<br/><br/>In this movie, as in 1991's ""Point Break"", a young guy called Johnny Utah goes undercover for the FBI to try identifying and catching a group of mysterious adrenaline junkies committing a string of crimes. But the similarities don't go much farther. Even the title means something different here. Rather than using the phrase as the surfing term that it is, this movie contains dialog that twists it into meaning something more like ""breaking point"", as in an individual's personal breaking point. That's because the 2015 update changes the gang that Johnny's investigating from surfers into the most extreme of extreme sports athletes. These guys are supposedly attempting a completely fictional list of extreme sports challenges called the ""Osaki 8"". These ""ordeals"", as the script refers to them, have new-age-sounding names like ""Emerging Force"", ""Life of Wind"" and ""Master of Six Lives"" and are supposed to lead to spiritual enlightenment. But who knows if that's true? No one has yet survived all eight parts of the challenge! 2015's ""Point Break"" is like the 1991 version on steroids and speed and more adrenaline and whatever else you can think of. Luke Bracey plays Utah, a former high-speed motocross star who left the sport after an especially dangerous ride goes horribly wrong and is now a trainee with the FBI. Delroy Lindo is the instructor who expresses doubts that Utah has what it takes to be an agent. When a small group of daredevils pulls off a series of highly expensive thefts around the world (each heist coupled with a different death-defying stunt), Utah's instructor turns to him for help and sends him undercover to identify and catch the bad guys. Aided by British agent Angelo Pappas (Ray Winstone), Utah catches up with the gang at a huge surfing party off the coast of France. A spiritual rebel called Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez) apparently sees something in the fellow extreme sports enthusiast who just showed up out of nowhere because Bodhi befriends Utah and makes him part of his inner circle, which includes the beautiful and equally spiritual Samsara Dietz (Teresa Palmer). What follows is some very extreme rock climbing, wingsuit flying and snowboarding as Utah tries to prove that this is the gang of criminals that he is pursuing, even as he bonds with the members of Bodhi's group. All the while, the scenery is more beautiful, the stunts are more dangerous, the action is more intense and the plot is more violent than last time. While this movie's visuals are considerably more spectacular than in the original, 2015's ""Point Break"" lacks the colorful characters, sense of fun and marginally believable logic of that 1991 version.<br/><br/>Some may think it unfair to compare this remake with the movie that inspired it, but 2015's ""Point Break"" seems to beg for the comparison. The new version reuses the names of the main characters from the first movie and even recasts one of the original actors (the FBI director who played ""LBJ"" in the earlier version). The 2015 film also pays homage to the 1991 film in other ways, such as the inclusion of a surfing scene. That, however, feels more like an obligatory nod to this movie's origins rather than a heartfelt honoring of the original because the remake changes almost everything else about the plot, the characters and their motivations. Without the name ""Point Break"" attached to it, this wouldn't be much more than a second-tier action movie, an ungrounded film with little reason to exist on its own.<br/><br/>Very little of this ""Point Break"" overhaul works. The actors aren't believable in their roles, their characters act inconsistently (and even non-sensically) and the script puts dialog in their mouths which often sounds dumb. Here's one example of that last point: When Utah cautions Bodhi saying ""You're gonna cross a line you can't come back from,"" Bodhi responds, ""That's the difference between us. All you see are lines. We see the truth."" To quote another character later in the film, ""What the hell does that even mean?"" The only thing that makes this movie special is its fantastic stunts, the impressive cinematography that captures them and the spectacular landscapes in which they take place. Those scenes alone may make the film worth seeing for some Movie Fans, but for most of us, that won't be enough to redeem a remake that's otherwise pretty dumb. I enjoyed those scenes but the main thing they did for me as a reviewer was keep me from giving this movie the lower grade that the rest of the film deserves. Yes, I happen to be a big fan of the original ""Point Break"", but even judging the 2015 version completely on its own merits, it falls short of what I would consider a quality action movie. ""C"""
"Ramascreen","1","5","11","26 December 2015"," Pointless Break
","If I wanted to watch videos about people doing extreme sports, I can just do that via YouTube. #PointBreak remake is essentially about Brian O'Connor infiltrating Dominic Toretto's gang and we start to question where his loyalty lies.. o, my bad, that's actually the plot for ""The Fast And The Furious"" It's been years since I saw the 1991 Kathryn Bigelow-directed original ""Point Break"" starring Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze and this remake pretty much has similar logline in that Luke Bracey plays an FBI agent infiltrating a team of criminals. But instead of Bank Robbers and only surfers, this time it's more than just heists and it also features all kinds of other extreme sports activities from motocross to wingsuit skydiving to snowboarding to climbing angel falls, and the team is headed by Edgar Ramirez's character who's determined to reach spiritual enlightenment. And at one point, Luke Bracey's character also fires his gun to the air out of frustration, Keanu probably would look at that version and go, 'Really?!' Again, it's been a long while since I watched the 1991 film, so I won't make the comparison here, but what you need to keep in mind is that this POINT BREAK is style over substance. It's all just about looks and daredevil stunts, there's nothing about the story that anchors you in, the performances of the actors are mediocre, it's one of the most badly-written films I've seen all year, and watching this film would be the most time-wasting way to spend your holidays. Not to mention the film leads to a pointless meaningless ending. So much for that search for enlightenment. The only winners out of all this are the stuntmen and the green screen background."

"clarkmick33","5","2","3","5 June 2016"," Stunts are amazing, story is shite
","I was curious to see how they could build upon the original Point Break with all the modern tech of today, visually I was amazed at the stunts and beautiful filming locations - however the story is really a big let down.<br/><br/>The plausibility of how the whole film comes together is quite unbelievable. Its a bit like they thought of the stunts and then somehow had to figure out a story to connect the dots. It is that obvious<br/><br/>You do not really get to see any character development at all. To me the biggest loop hole that you just cannot ignore is that the main protagonist is established as a great free style motor cross driver however when needed he is also somehow a pro surfer, wing-suit specialist, free style snowboarder, naked (no rope) cliff climber. Sorry - you do not just need an absence of fear to do some of those activities you need quite a bit of training and preparation. Naked cliff climbing requires tremendous upper body strength you would definitely need to do a hell of a lot of climbs to achieve that.<br/><br/>In summary this film is a great excuse to show some daredevil stunts and amazing locations with a bit of product placement to boot. However today most of this can be found on YouTube - For Freeeeeeee"
"olliemankz","5","2","3","15 May 2016"," Point-less
","Point-less<br/><br/>I'm sorry .. I just couldn't resist the play on words. Normally, I never pan anything because how many of us manage to put together a movie? And this one was a huge production judging by the length of time the credits over dramatic music went on afterwards.<br/><br/>Truly, the movie is a beautiful mounting, although I felt the color tones were a bit depressing. I'm sure that was a choice but, again, had I had the no-doubt monumental initiative to have become the director, and had I been the director, I think I would have gone with something a little brighter no matter how bleak the story.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing the original Point Break redone, not because I expected there could be any improvement to the classic with the unbeatably hot Keanu Reeves nailing something of a debut as the opposite of an airhead, but just because it would be interesting to see how the 1991 film would be revisited 24 years later. I guess that's what goaded the filmmakers to give the movie a new story, and, you know, you have to admit, robbing banks in Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon masks probably wouldn't resonate as much today. As it was, the movie did give a nod to those famous scenes when the antiheroes rode around on little motorbikes that made me wonder if they might be able to fold them up and put them in their back pockets, with masks that, if they did not recognizably mock famous people, were paired with signs such as President Obama's campaign cry ""Yes we can."" Yes we can was a funny take on the so- called criminals doing exactly what they weren't supposed to do just as, in the original, the filmmakers had fun with Nixon's cry of ""I am not a crook."" Though the current filmmakers apparently couldn't figure out how to work in Bill Clinton's ""I did not have sex with that woman.""<br/><br/>The ""Yes we can"" referred to something else, though ... what these new quasi-criminals dared to do in the execution of and mostly the getaway from their, I guess I'll call them exploits because, more than in the original, the question was if they really were criminals. The problem with the newer story was that there was not much, er, point to this. If you're a fan of American Ninja Warrior or the original American Gladiator which seems to have spawned such shows then you might enjoy what ensues ... extreme sports. If you enjoy watching a string of challenges which have little to do with conflict, go for it. That kind of falls into the James Bond reason for being in my mind, at least of yore; the Daniel Craig ones are more complex, have more character development, as English students always say. With the Bond movies, people were fascinated with the spyware. But if you don't want a plot that is just an excuse for such a showcase, in this case of physical courage, turn away now. I did like how the main roles were cast against the types, Reeves and Swayze, whom we remember from 1991. Luke Bracey is hot ... you'll remember him from November Man but not know it. I guess the guy can act. But now I'm going to go and rewatch the original to see why it worked."
"joeyajames-555-640684","3","2","3","30 April 2016"," Don't Waste Your Time
","I gave it 3/10 because some of the action and stunt sequences are pretty well done. But beyond that, this film has no other redeeming qualities. There's no character development at all. Unlike the original, you don't find yourself rooting for either the good guy or the bad guy, but just waiting for them both to die. And I guess there's a new law that you can only do extreme sports if you have at least 10 really bad fake-looking tattoos. This remake has really nothing in common with the original except the name, and the character names. There was no plot in this film. I really can't believe they spent $100M making this film! They could have just spliced together some cool stock footage from GoPro and done much better for a whole lot less. Even if you don't care about the lame plot and lack of acting, and you think you want to see it just for the action, STILL skip it! Spend the 2 hours watching YouTube clips of sport stunts instead, and you won't want to kick yourself 2 hours later."
"fabkingcliff","4","2","3","4 April 2016"," The Citizen Kane of bad
","This movie sucks. The writing sucks. The direction sucks. The score sucks. The actors suck. God, even the trees in this movie suck. I hated every audience-insulting minute of it. If there has ever been a worse script for an action film, I don't know it. This, ladies and gents, is quite possibly the worst action yarn ever printed on celluloid.<br/><br/>Where do I start. I would begin by saying that this film sucks, but I'm sure I've already said that. This isn't the worst film ever made. No, indeed. It is the worst thing ever. It is the single worst thing that we as human beings have ever created. It isn't merely the drab direction, or the subnormal screenplay, or even the acting so wooden that it belongs to the lumber section of Home Depot. No, it is the sheer thought that anyone in their right mind believed this idea could be translated into a screenplay, let alone a motion picture.<br/><br/>The story revolves around an overzealous extreme sports athlete (Luke Bracey) who, following the accidental death of his friend during a motorcycle mountain drift, decides to enlist into an FBI recruitment program. He is soon assigned to apprehend a group of criminals who are also extreme athletes pursuing a utopian venture known as the Ozaki 8; a series of ordeals that supposedly honor the forces of nature. Upon completion, the poly-athlete reaches a state of nirvana and the world should henceforth become a better place. These athletes are committing crimes in the name of 'giving back to mother nature'. At one point, they blow up a gold mine to 'liberate' the gold inside. The new FBI recruit ""Utah"" (Luke Bracey), our guy, infiltrates this crime ring in order to turn them in.<br/><br/>Lest he be discovered, he joins them on most of these highly dangerous ordeals upon their spiritual quest. How the FBI (which looks more like a private detective firm) allows him to do so, I cannot explain. As the movie drags on, you slowly discover that we're really just given an excuse to watch the ex poly-athlete perform extreme sports shenanigans across a backdrop of picturesque locations captured with fast-moving camera dollies. This is what happens when a cinematographer thinks he can write and direct his own film. Only the photography part survives. Barely.<br/><br/>This film has been labeled a Mountain Dew commercial, a Red Bull sponsored TV segment and so on, but I beg to differ; it is a waste of time. And to think that it was marketed everywhere as if a new George Miller film. I felt my IQ points drop by the tenfold every time the actors tried to explain this trite befogged screenplay with their frozen facial expressions (I make no reference to the ski range scenes) and thick Croatian accents. Within the first minutes you might think that the script gets better and some redeeming event happens I wouldn't hold my breath.<br/><br/>Some of the action is good, some of the cinematography is great, all of the plot is bad. For example, each time a member of the group dies they celebrate and with a devil-may-care attitude. ""We must continue our Narnia-like quest my brothers."" (Not a direct quote)<br/><br/>What's up with that? Does is it say anywhere in the script that these guys are actual close friend who with a minimum of human decency should mourn the death of their kin? Never mind. They even welcome a random guy (said Utah)into their group with no fear that he could be an informant, given their line of work; just because he's got a few bad tattoos across his chest and can throw a punch.<br/><br/>The ending puts the final nail in the coffin of this green screen drama. The question that is left echoing in your head is what the hell did I just watch? Am I being pranked? Who wraps up a story like that? What was the moral behind it? Is this an artistic gimmick/mystery to be left for interpretation at online debate forums? Like a Scorsesian food-for-thought? Visibly it is more than one question and no, it is none of those things.<br/><br/>Miss this movie at all costs. Save your money and Intelligence Quotient. As the late Roger Ebert once said, ""Miss it, I doubt that it will be around to miss for long."""

Compared to the entire cast of this 'remake' Keanu is Laurence Olivier on one of his better days.<br/><br/>The stunts were badly done over all, and filmed even more poorly. The shots that weren't CG appeared to be filmed via a GoPro. The emotive capacity of the majority of the cast could be bettered by several lumps of dyed Play Dough, the plot better written by a Radio Shack Tandy computer, and the entire production was painfully predictable.<br/><br/>Spoiler: The only real similarities with the original Point Break are the use of presidential masks (worse and cheaper than in the original), the protagonist's name, and the gunshots in the air scene... also replicated in the far better movie Hot Fuzz."

Fast forward to 2015 and Ericson Core brings us extreme sports involved with an FBI agent which subtly brings the audience an extreme dud.

Neither of the ideas that I have listed here is inherently terrible, although neither one would probably be a masterpiece. The problem with these two ideas is that I have taken the title of a previously made film that was of a very high quality and a classic and grafted it onto my so-so film ideas. That is the problem with the 2015 ""remake"" of Point Break, a film released in 1991 about a group of extreme sports aficionados that finance their globetrotting pursuit of their hobby by robbing banks. That film was filled with imaginative storytelling and great action sequences and is the kind of film that you can watch over and over again.<br/><br/>Here's the thing. The 2015 version of Point Break is about a group of extreme sports aficionados that commit crimes not to finance their lifestyle, but as part of some high minded mumbo jumbo filled spiritual quest. In itself the 2015 film is not completely terrible, it just seems that way because the creators decided to graft the title of a really great and memorable film onto it and doomed it to being compared to a much better film.

"bowmanblue","4","1","1","1 July 2017"," Point Break – 'Point-less'
","I'm sorry, there must be tonnes of reviews out there that have used the 'pointless' pun. I couldn't help it. It's just too obvious. In case you didn't know, 'Point Break' is a classic action/cop movie of the nineties. Therefore, because of its 'classic' status, it was deemed 'remakeable' by our good friends - those wonderful Hollywood executives. Now, I like to think I'm not a 'remake snob' – there are arguments for remaking a film, normally if you have a fresh take on something, or if the film was made so long ago that people have practically forgotten the original. However, 'Point Break' was only made in the nineties and is still pretty dear to many people – namely me. I may be able to forgive this new version for anything other than a cynical cash-grab if the original source material was particularly outdated, but unfortunately the sad fact is that the (dare I say 'proper?') 'Point Break' still looks as good today as it ever did.<br/><br/>In case you don't know, both 'Point Breaks' are about a young FBI agent (Johnny Utah) who has to infiltrate a gang of bank robbers led by 'Bodhi' who indulge in extreme sports, in order to gain their trust and catch them, obviously. Whereas the original had Keanu Reeves playing our FBI hero and Patrick Swayze as the lead robber, the new one has er, actually I don't know either of them. I like to think I'm reasonably good with actors, but I've never seen either of these two in anything! But, I won't hold that against them. I'll save my disdain for the chemistry between pretty much everyone on screen. Everyone just seemed to be trying too hard to steer away from what we already know about the film, but never really achieving it. This new 'Point Break' incarnation is like a meteorite that's got hopelessly trapped in a planet's gravitational pull and is fighting against the odds in a losing battle to escape.<br/><br/>The new 'Point Break' does its best to try and create something new. The bank robbers don't just surf like they do in the original and it's set across multiple locations around the world, rather than just a single beach in America, but it's simply not enough. I've briefly touched upon the lack of chemistry between the lead characters, but this really becomes obvious when they try and throw in the obligatory 'love interest' in there for Johnny Utah the 2nd. It's truly painful. Almost as bad as watching (the usually awesome) Ray Winstone as Johnny's partner Angelo Pappas. It's just weird hearing these names again, only seeing different faces associated with them.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, I didn't hate the remake. It's a decent enough film and, if you're into anything from extreme sports to cops and robbers films, you'd probably get some entertainment out of it. But there's a MAJOR but. This only applies if you've never seen the original. If you've watched that you'll be crying out for a slice of Reeves and Swayze. So, if you haven't already seen the original, go and watch that – it's a true classic of its time which still holds up today. Let the remake be a message to Hollywood that we're not interested in seeing all our favourite movies redone just to make a quick buck."

","Look the 5/10 is for the deservedly recognized action adventure stunt sequences which are often quite white knuckle and intensely effective. But what is left: glum Macy's cologne models often either find kinship or oppose each other. No energy or spirit in the performances. And why I love the film this is ""inspired by"" is that the action sequences are just part of why it appeals to me. Swayze as Bodhi simply can't be duplicated. Lori Petty as his sis and Keanu Reeves' romantic interest is a cool chick. Gary Busey as Reeves' FBI colleague has hilarious lines, achieves plenty of good will with us, and is supportive / loyal to a fault. Keanu has the look of an action hero even if sometimes his performances are rather lacking in real gusto. Not one cast member besides a welcome Delroy Lindo gives us much at all to enjoy on screen. Ray Winstone just doesn't have a part that plays off his strengths as a customary badass who can blow others off the screen. Edgar Martinez has as much charisma as a sharp rock he climbs up during the ""Eiger Sanction"" mountain climbing sequence. Luke Bracey is a pretty boy GQ advertisement model who can stare and emote ""serious and somber thinking man"" but it doesn't make us give a rat's ass about him as much as wet panties. The others who follow Martinez serve as body count fodder who fail to complete the ""Ozaki 8"" behind their leader. What is damn good are the locations and numerous impactful stunt and action sequences which include cliff-diving, mountain climbing, surfing, an avalanche purposely caused by explosives to damn up a gold mining operation, gunfights, and chases in curvy streets or along dangerous curves around mountains. Waterfalls, large waves, trips out of windows on high rises, snowboarding down snowy, treacherous, mountainous, rocky peaks, and wingsuit flight by the film's anti-heroes all create exhilarating and gulp-in-the-throat sequences of awe; but when the characters must talk and there's a bothersome FBI plot of this extreme sports agent infiltrating (and becoming allured by) a ""wolf pack"" gang of criminals needing funding to support their cause the film is rendered dull and cumbersome. With Teresa Palmer (who has went from ""cheerleader pretty"" roles to ""edgy pretty"" roles) as love interest to Bracey, handcuffed with an underwritten and rather cliché part. The locations are resplendent as are the action sequences which occur on them. Great cinematography and editing boost the film a lot, too. The money spent on the goods deliver. The cast and plot, don't."
"jtindahouse","4","1","1","12 December 2016"," Very little going for it
","I once told someone that I hadn't seen the original 'Point Break' film, and they acted with utter shock and disbelief that a film-buff like myself would not have seen that film. It appears that the original has quite a passionate fan-base. I decided to skip the original and just go straight to the remake. It would appear that may have been a bad idea. This was a pretty dreadful effort at making a film. The problems were abundant. The acting is bad, the story is bland and completely lacking in creativity, and the dialogue is poor and often feels like it has been written by a teenager (at best). It also spends too much time simply trying to look impressive, with long drawn out ""action"" sequences of people surfing or free-diving. The only problem with these sequences is that nothing of any importance is actually happening during them. We might as well be watching clips of random people doing the same things on Youtube. I get the strong impression that this film is very far from the quality of the original, because there's no way the original could have achieved a cult following if it was as bad as this film.<br/><br/>I actually really wanted to like 'Point Break'. It started out alright in the first ten minutes or so, while the story was being set up, and I thought to myself wouldn't it be a nice surprise if the critics were completely off base with this one and it turns out to be a diamond in the rough. Sadly, it wasn't to be. Soon after, the whole thing fell apart and never recovered. It's a shame too, because it sounds like a lot of effort went into making the film. It took nearly a year and they traveled all over the world in an extensive shoot. If you're going to go to that kind of effort, you're going to want a script that justifies it. That wasn't the case here."

The original is a classic in my book. Great story line, great cast. In this one, the whole core of the movie is changed. Bodhi and his crew are chasing to complete 8 tasks of nature to achieve complete nirvana. OK, I'm with that. Johnny Utah is now a motocross legend instead of a star quarterback. Fine, I can deal with that. But AT LEAST make the story the same! They completely slaughtered this movie. <br/><br/>The only reason I give it a 4/10 is because some of the actions scenes are cool. Other than that, the movie has 0 substance. <br/><br/>There is no love story between Utah and the new girl named Somsara? There is no relationship between Utah and Pappas (his partner?) and when members of Bodhi's crew die off, no one cares. <br/><br/>In my opinion, not worth your time to watch.

He gets help from Angelo Pappas (Ray Winstone) and infiltrates a group led by Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez). He becomes close to Samsara Dietz (Teresa Palmer).<br/><br/>It starts with a ridiculous CGI action scene. This movie has plenty of them. They may be the only compelling goodness derived from this movie. The action is over-the-top and somewhat fun. The story and the actors are another matter. It starts with the very bland Luke Bracey. It's another hunky Aussie. There is nothing to the character and he's unable to inject anything into it. It's hard to remember sometimes but Keanu Reeves has an unique charm that really works well in certain movies. In this one, the movie grinds to a halt whenever there is no action.

You can see a lot of extreme sports , the respect of nature, willing of changing to world to be a better place. <br/><br/>I think everyone likes outdoor will like this movie. I have not found another one that can combine outdoor and story so perfectly. <br/><br/>And this film is not only about outdoor, it's about spirit, courage, love of the nature, brotherhood and love. <br/><br/>The last surfing of Edgar is so touchable as you can see the greatest of nature, the smallest of human and the courage when human faces the nature.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful movie. I recommend everyone likes outdoor or likes to protect the environment to take a look."

","Excellent, but it's to a certain intellectual level of understanding, not to ""anyones IQ""! Superb! You have to feel the energy that moved the team who worked on this film, and feel in your own skin the plot, it's not only ""watch a movie and eat popcorn"", it's more about feel and live it! it's more deep, you need to dive in it! Pure Adrenaline! Sad that people didn't understand what the film is about, it is a really good film. People judge from their level of knowledge and intellect, unfortunately end up condemning it to failure without even understanding details, plot, image, special effects, level of hard work to make something really different from what we are sick and tired of seeing. This movie is not superficial, and it's not made for superficial people."

","The original Point Break is one of the films I can say inspired me as a child to want to skydive. 20 years later, having followed that dream I can pick holes in the original, but it still carries the same feeling for me that it did when I was a kid. The new film, is an emotionless void. We had been sold by the build up, directors telling us they wanted to commit to film the best extreme extreme sports action sequences possible. They failed. We heard how they were committed to using real athletes to make the scenes as authentic as possible. They needn't have bothered when they are using so much CGI anyway. Take the wingsuit scene for example. The crack is one of the best known lines in the sport, and a quick 5 minute search on YouTube will fine you dozens of clips of many different people flying that exact same line with better cinematography, filmed by their mate with a GoPro on his helmet. The film instead cuts in CGI close ups which absolutely diminish the incredible skill of the pilots who flew the line for the film. Aside from that, the plot is weak, the acting is wooden and you don't care about the characters at all, but that's not why we went. We were sold on the promise of the best extreme sports scenes ever filmed, and what we got was a complete mess, full of the CGI we were hoping to be absent."

","I am really surprised by the vitriolic nature of several of the reviews for this film. I am in agreement with one of the reviewers, however. I went to the film in China with absolutely no expectations or knowledge of the film this one is based on. I was not bored. That automatically makes this film at least a five for me. <br/><br/>There are so many boring comic book films with special effects, as well as too many zombie and Dracula rip-offs that put me to sleep in fifteen minutes. This film did not bore me in the least. It was fast-paced, beautifully photographed, and had an excellent sound track. If based on those variables, the film would have been a ten.<br/><br/>But, the actors, dialogue, and plot, unfortunately, did not measure up to the technical aspects of the film. I found the Utah character interesting, because we know a little about his background, but we know nothing about the background of any of the thrill-seeking gang. I am giving this film a 6 because it is the ultimate in eye candy without special effects. I go to the movies to relax and I enjoy a good adventure on the big screen (among other venues). This film fits the bill for that and I would recommend it (even if it is a little preachy).<br/><br/>Arthur H Tafero Senior Reviewer AskMrMovies"

","9 February 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Point Break. As a Patrick Swayze and a Keanu Reeves fan back in the day I was much in approval of their combining forces to make the original film, and when I heard about a remake I thought we would be going down that old route of second time round becoming rather second rate. I'll stop right there.....this film was very much it's own man!!!!! True we had an FBI agent infiltrating a gang to stop a major crime wave but the the similarities pretty much ground to a halt, unlike the film. Where the original was only centred around surfers, this latest offering was focused on many extreme sports and extremely well focused too. My idea of an extreme sport would be ironing in the garden, but here we are treated to different ways of getting down a mountain, leaving a building when you're over 100 floors up, and my worse nightmare, jumping from a perfectly serviceable aircraft (especially galling when it was a C130). Point Break this time, was grittier, darker, more daring and more dangerous and even when my stomach was churning at everything these guys were doing, I loved every minute of it. My hat goes off to the stunt men, I'm sure there were more than a few bruises to go round. But the script writers too deserve some applause as the story kept going throughout. Don't treat this as a remake, it's a new film and it's great!!!"
"RogerCampbell","5","3","7","25 December 2015"," If you're going to remake a movie like Point Break, do it right.
","While one shouldn't compare remakes to the originals, it's almost impossible to do. I have enjoyed the original Point Break countless times since it's release in 1991. It had flare, originality and style of a Kathryn Bigelow directed movie. But most of all the characters had charisma and the cast that played those characters brought that to life. Gary Busey, Lori Petty, and Keanu Reeves, all had an unmistakable on screen presence that stars have. But it was Patrick Swayze who played the character of Bodhi that really made this picture exciting to watch. No one will ever play Bodhi like Swazye did, that's almost enough said right there.<br/><br/>To me, the first and most obvious thing wrong with this movie is poor casting. Ramirez as Bodhi does nothing to bring this character to life. The character of Pappas(Ray Winstone)is also dead in the water, as is FBI Instructor Hall (Delroy Lindo). Luke Bracey as Johnny Utah was merely acceptable. In my opinion, the only really well cast part was that of Samsara, played by Teresa Palmer.<br/><br/>On a positive note for this movie I thought that the locations were beautifully filmed, the action along with the stunts was pretty good, and the script did vary enough from the original to make it worth watching at least once.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this remake of Point Break was a little disappointing and I can't help but think that if only they had cast these characters better and perhaps spent a little more money and brought in some star power that this remake would be a much more enjoyable movie. Obviously nothing will ever replace the original Point Break...which is what I am going to watch right now so I can remember this movie for what it should be and not for this ill advised remake that I just saw in the theater."

","""Point Break"" was a substantial bomb when it was released in theaters, and it doesn't take long into watching it to figure out why audiences rejected it. Certainly it was hurt by its casting. It isn't just that the actors hired weren't big stars, but they are extremely unconvincing in their roles - Luke Bracey is one of the most unlikely FBI agents I have seen in a movie. The biggest problem I had with the movie is that it's really dull for the most part. Certainly the action sequences are flatly staged and directed, but the material that is between the action sequences should have also had some spark to keep the audience's attention. I will admit that there are a few cool visuals here and there, but their impact is somewhat diluted by the fact that the ENTIRE FILM is shot in murky and dark colors. This is one ugly looking movie. Stick with the original version - it's not a great movie, but it's more competently done than this remake."

","I rarely write movie reviews, but this movie was just so bad that I felt compelled to share my opinion. The acting is horrible, the story is horrible and the dialogue is horrible. The studio basically wanted to appeal to the x-games audience so threw scenes from every extreme sport they could think of. The movie includes snowboarding, sky diving, rock climbing, motocross and surfing. The story is about a group of guys that steal from rich corporations and give it to the poor and want to complete 8 extreme challenges. The story really did not make a lot of sense and the dialogue is extremely clichéd and poorly written. I really felt like I had wasted 90 minutes of my life after watching this movie."

","Before reading this contains spoilers. Well I've finally got to watch this movie, can't really say I was expecting something really great due to all reviews I've read, but I gave it a shot. <br/><br/>1. The scenery was majestic,... with a some CGI (which later came out really flat). But the filters and landscape was really impressive.<br/><br/>2. The action in the start and the stunts all over the movie were done really great (don't count the flying shots half of those were made so bad it ruined the whole part).<br/><br/>3. The story, yeah in the start (and trailer) showed some promise really, with Ozaki eight, some character background which in development slaughtered the whole movie. The girl in the movie seemed something forced, no real implication why she was there in the first place or why she had to form some romantic bond with main character? <br/><br/>4. The acting and characters... seemed flat, unoriginal, main ""villain"" in the story acted like self-righteous prick, his team mates kept dying and he was all about choosing his own path, making him a look really cold every time when someone died. At original Point Break you kinda feel for the guy - who wanted to get that last ride, here you just ask yourself why again Johnny doesn't shoot the guy. There was no real connection or story or reason to let that guy go with some sleezy handshake that made me cry... (in a bad way with some facepalm) <br/><br/>5. I felt more sorry for the guy who was bleeding from his head on a surfboard (20s cameo) at the start then any of the ""team"" getting wasted. That girl getting killed what was with that, why put here there in the first place, she seemed really forced in the movie and made you keep asking who is she again? Why is she here? Is it gonna be some complications like in the original?... Well sorry to BREAK to to you but the POINT is she is as irrelevant as that Jeff's motorbike falling from the cliff.<br/><br/>This movie is watchable if you're doing something beside actually watching it.

","Johnny Utah, filled with guilt when a friend dies needlessly in an extreme action stunt gone wrong, joins the FBI. As you do. He realises that a small gang pulling off weird Robin-Hood-type crimes, is actually doing so by following an extreme sports philosophy. He infiltrates the gang, but possibly finds himself in over his head.<br/><br/>This iteration of Point Break isn't really a remake. It uses some of the same names, and there is some surfing and skydiving in it, but most of the plot dynamics are different. Luke Bracy, as Utah, looks incredibly like Heath Ledger. Edgar Ramirez plays gang leader Bodhi and oozes charisma. Ray Winstone collects a pay cheque. Delroy Lindo as an FBI medium-wig (not as high up as a big-wig). Teresa Palmer fills a bikini. There are some other people in it, heaven knows who they are.<br/><br/>The plot here makes little sense but that doesn't matter. What matters are the spectacular visuals of surfing, snowboarding, rock climbing, wing-suiting etc. Some of this is undoubtedly CGI'd, but even then the background plates are stunning. And 3D really enhances these sequences – the movie is worth catching in 3D for the visuals in the action sequences.<br/><br/>The rest of it is pretty empty stuff, however, with little emotional connection to any of the characters despite determined efforts to create a philosophical bromance between Utah and Bodhi."
"jack-fitzpatrick","5","2","4","31 January 2016"," Average, Mediocre, Fine, OK and passable.
","POINT Break Review – Jack Fitzpatrick . In general, point break is sort of a mess. The characters are empty vessels, their motivations are sort of silly and how we are meant to feel about them is downright confusing. Truth be told: the movie wasn't THAT bad. <br/><br/>It was Fine. <br/><br/>This movie follows a character by the name of Utah, an ex- famous athlete who is now making his way into a career with the FBI. Utah gets a big chance to work on a big case; Following a group of seemingly professional athlete criminals. Utah soon falls undercover so he can gain the trust of this group of people, find out the information he needs and take them down. The thing is, it's not really done right <br/><br/>Alright, well I'll start off with the positive; To put it simply, they do some cool stuff. This movie basically felt like a YouTube video that RedBull or some other extreme sports channel would have to offer. The film is an extreme sports advertisement, and hey, some of it looks really cool. The action was shot exceedingly well.<br/><br/>From the opening scene with some sweet dirt bike action to the unique and odd looking act of Wingsuit Flying and the intimidatingly dangerous view of gigantic waves pursuing to crash over you while surfing. The movie did make me want to go out and try some of this stuff and was successful in making extreme sports look both dangerous and fun. Making these scenes even better is the fact that most of this stunt work was shot practically. Which seems to be a thing falling into fashion nowadays since films like Mad Max: Fury Road. Crammed between the action scenes however are our obligatory pieces of exposition. And this is where the film really begins to fail. The problem is that you just don't care. You don't care why the characters are doing what they're doing and you don't really care if they even make it out of these situations that they're trying to explain to begin with. <br/><br/>Really the main problem with this film was its characters. I have seen the movie and I still don't understand who these people are or why they are doing the things that they do. Our protagonist is a boring cardboard cut-out – Doing what he needs to and nothing more, and the antagonist is just as charmless, just as dull and lacking in any sort of personality. As well as a few side characters put in there for no real purpose, such as ""The girl."" Who is there solely to be ""The Girl"" of the movie. <br/><br/>The most offensive part of this film is that this is supposed to be a character piece. This is supposed to portray a compelling relationship. It is supposed to divide the Utah's Morals, but instead he stays completely good, we have no doubt in our minds that he is on the right side of the law for any moment. He is not seduced to a life of crime at any point.<br/><br/>Our antagonist Bodhi is just as nonsensical. The film attempts to make this character appear as some sort of deeply spiritual man, with a heart of gold who just happens to do bad things. He believes in this borderline religious belief about committing impossible acts as a way to gain the ultimate experiences And then he must also commit more impossible acts but commit crimes these times to give back to the world because the first ones he did were gifts? Look, the point is it's pretty ridiculous. The film should have had this character either just be a criminal because it's fun and for financial gain or they could have messed around with this idea without trying to make the character seem real cool and edgy. He didn't have to be so ""Zen"" is all I'm saying. He comes off as too preachy and too perfect. It's like the film wants you to root for this philosophically illogical guy. <br/><br/>Visually, this film is rather pretty. The cool colors of the environments surrounding our characters throughout the film drown the screen in profound blues and green. Scenes involving large oceanic waves, deep green forests and unfathomably tall mountainsides covered in pure white snow and jagged rocks are simply beautiful to look at. This is where the cinematography and framing really excels in the film. The film's camera work and editing is passable. It feels both professional and modern, it doesn't bring much that's new to the table however to be fair not many movies do or even can and the work put into the film visually should still be appreciated.<br/><br/>The acting is OK. There is nothing to stand out but it, but it the actors get the job done. The writing is FINE, but ultimately uninspired and comes off as a failed attempt of being overly spiritual and profound. (This is most apparent during Bodhi's dialogue especially.) Ultimately, the whole movie is nothing more or less than average. I'm not angry at the movie, I wasn't TOO bored, but I didn't love it and I wasn't not bored either. All in all, Point break is acceptable and nothing more or less. <br/><br/>Point break is the definition of 'Style over Substance.' With an uninteresting 'Romance,' some cliché 'cop moments' and a laughable redo of a classic scene from the original - Point Break mostly fails. But it's still far from the worst thing I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It's entertaining enough if you have nothing to do and it's got some great action. This is the kind of movie to pop on, half-watch and enjoy some thoughtless action, and to be fair there is nothing wrong with doing that every once in a while. If you can let the 'Remake Bias' go, and keep your expectations low, this movie's fine. 5/10"
"lincolnhawk-87377","1","0","0","5 July 2020"," Impressively Soulless
","It's one thing to make a soulless movie, it's another to do so in a remake of a movie that was so FULL of soul - it almost seems intentional. The Ex-Presidents in the original really felt like a tight-knit brotherhood; in the remake, they appear to have decided that simply slapping some tattoos and scars on the characters and having them hold hands around a picnic table, hug each other a few times and fortune cookie-philosophize is enough to paint that bond. It isn't. Ramirez had a hard act to follow with Swayze's original Bodi (one of my favourite movie characters and Swayze roles) and was never really given a chance with such a weak script. As a screen presence he had some of Swayze's zen vibe, but again it is as if the writers and director intentionally sucked all the soul out of his character by giving him nothing to work with. The whole eco-warrior thing really didn't work either; you care more about the Ex-Presidents who were simply about not being part of the system, following the waves and stealing to fund their travels than the tree-hugging crew who aren't in it for the money in the remake. The one way that the remake could have improved on the original was to cast the lead with an actor who can actually act, Keanu Reeves standing out in the original as his usual wooden, cardboard cut-out of a character, Ted Theodore Logan packing an FBI badge this time. But...no. They cast THAT guy, I don't even recall his name, another lifeless cut-out with acceptable surf-hair being sufficient, I guess. With a decent Johnny Utah this time round you could at least say they did THAT right, but again, it is almost as if they wanted to miss on every level. Ray Winstone is a great actor, but yet again, he was given nothing to work with, whereas Busey's Pappas was a larger-than-life character who actually had a role to play, not just there as the cut-out's ride. Lori Petty was the love interest in the original and had a fleshed-out character that you gave a damn about, whereas, yet again, Teresa Palmer was given a character who simply spouted a few hippy-dippy lines and was thrown in to simply look good in a swimsuit. John C. McGinley was fantastic as the FBI chief in the original and despite having less lines, stood out far more than Delroy Lindo's version. It actually hurt me to see James LeGros cameo in this remake because it was a physical connection to the original - there should be no connection at all, this is an insult to the original. Hot Fuzz pays proper tribute to the original and its homage to Utah emptying his gun into the air as he lets Bodi escape garners the appropriate reaction, a grin, as opposed to the grimace it causes in this remake. I won't even bother commenting on the actual plot or meat of the movie, it really doesn't matter, it's just filler between the stunts. Other reviews put it perfectly, that this remake is just a bunch of Red Bull extreme sport YouTube videos pieced together and called a ""movie"". If you haven't seen the original, watch it. It might not hit you the same way as it did someone who saw it back in the day (for me, I saw it when it came out in 1991 when I was 15) but you will hopefully appreciate it for a solid, entertaining action movie. Kathryn Bigelow is a legit director who knows how to inject soul in a movie - see Near Dark too, another one of her earlier movies that really shows how she can paint a picture of a tight-knit unit. I haven't seen any of Core's other movies and will actively avoid them after watching this empty Extreme Sports commercial shamelessly disguised as a movie."

They already cleared three, and Utah predicts they'll attempt the fourth on a rare sea wave phenomenon in France. After presenting his analysis, Utah gets sent undercover to France under a field agent Pappas. They reach the place and Utah gets help from others to surf the tall tube wave. <br/><br/>But as he goes in there's already another surfer in the wave, leaving Utah with unstable wave. Utah gets sucked into the wave and faints but the other surfer bails and rescues Utah. He wakes aboard a yacht with the other surfer Bodhi and his team Roach, Chowder, and Grommet. They leave him to enjoy the party and he gets acquainted with a girl Samsara. The next day Utah finds the men in an abandoned Paris train station after he overhears them about the location. Bodhi gives him an initiation fight and soon he's in the circle. They travel to the Alps for the next ordeal, wingsuit flying through the cliffs. The four succeed in their attempt then have some time together with Samsara. The next day they climb the snow peaks for the sixth ordeal, snowboarding through steep wall of snow. They reach their spot but Utah decides to extend his line so the others follow him. But Chowder slips and falls to his death. Utah gets depressed about it. After a party Samsara explains about her and Bodhi. <br/><br/>Next they travel to a gold mine where Bodhi detonates some explosives Grommet and Roach planted. After blowing his cover, Utah chases Bodhi, managing to trip his bike. But Bodhi escapes as Utah can't stand up after the crash. The FBI freezes Bodhi's sponsor's assets so Bodhi plans to rob a nearby Italian bank on a mountain top. Utah and the police intercept the group, resulting in a crossfire that kills Roach. As the group flees, Utah chases and shoots one of them but it turns out to be Samsara. Utah finds the next ordeal location, solo rock climbing with no safety besides a waterfall. he finds Bodhi and Grommet and chases them on the climb, but Grommet cramps and falters, falling to his death. Utah catches up to Bodhi but he leaps down the waterfall, completing the last ordeal. But Bodhi has to redo the fourth ordeal as he bailed out on the wave. 17 months later Utah finds him in the Pacific facing another giant wave. But ultimately Utah lets Bodhi go and attempt it. The wave engulfs Bodhi and Utah comes back home.<br/><br/>I admit I haven't seen the original Keanu Reeves movie. But I already found significant differences just by looking at the synopsis on IMDb. This movie sure packs quite a promise with the new repackaging of adding in an assortment of other extremes sports besides surfing into the mix. What's quite interesting is that the movie's made up teachings of Ozaki 8 managed to steer some interest. Some people, including me, done searches about it on the internet, believing that it was something real but unpopular yet. I say that the story writer did a good thing in this aspect.<br/><br/>Yet the movie didn't really capitalize well on this, or should I say didn't even anticipate it. There's no official landing page about the movie anywhere on the internet that those searches should easily link to. The Ozaki 8 would've been one cool thing to interest people into watching this movie instead of relying on the movie being a remake from the 1991 version.<br/><br/>The stunts, yes the stunts can also have an appeal. Yet the movie really failed to package this into great rides for the audience. Although there's more extreme sports depicted in this movie, those action sequences didn't really pack any punch, especially if we compare it to similar movies like, say, Vin Diesel's xXx. The stunts here only show the same stuff as what we'd see in cable TV, while like in xXx, there's the contingent thing happening, changing how the sequence carries on and forcing the athlete to improvise. Moreover, there's little cinematography treats offered on those sequences.<br/><br/>The acting overall really shouldn't be of much talk as it's just standard level. Luke Bracey didn't really give enough depth for his character even though he's the main protagonist. Edgar Ramirez on the other hand quite managed to portray Bodhi's mysterious and calm nature.Teresa Palmer and Ray Winstone are only in the movie to get some attention to it.<br/><br/>A mere 5 out of 10 score is from me for Point Break (2015). A recommendation is a definite no due to the movie being very much half- baked movie."
"subxerogravity","6","2","6","28 December 2015"," It's an OK remake of a good movie
","So of course I went into 2015's Point Break very skeptical. I remember 1991's version with fondness and I was not looking forward to the remake, but remakes happen in Hollywood. That's how it's been since its birth. What I will give this remake is that it did a good job of not being like the original.<br/><br/>The basic plot is the same. A young FBI agent is assigned to go undercover to find a group of action sports athletes committing crimes.<br/><br/>What's the difference? the big difference is the sure epicness this movie tries to put down on you. It's scaled to the max. The original basically took place on a beach, but the remake takes place on some of the biggest most beautiful mountains around the world. Bohdi and his band of misfits go from being surfer bums to globe trotting thrill seekers. The big budget is definitely the sign of the times we live in and helps raise the bar. some of the action sports sequences were amazing to look at. <br/><br/>Another sign of the times was how they tried to give the characters more depth. The bank robbers seem to be more spiritually incline, stating their actions are for a good cause bigger than themselves and that they are actually liberating the money. <br/><br/>Though the action sequences are...nice to look at, I was not really buying the righteousness of the villains. It makes the movie cheesy.<br/><br/>Plus the new guys they got playing Johnny Utah and Bohdi are no where near as compelling as what Keenu Reeves and The late great Patrick Swayze did with the roles. This is where the movie really does not hold a candle to the original.<br/><br/>I'll give this movie credit. It's called Point Break, but it stands on it's own and for the most part it does a good job of it. The action is bigger, but only decent, and I don't like what they did with the characters this time around."

","This movie looks gorgeous, without a lot of substance, and that's OK. This movie is clearly not going to win any Oscars for its plot or writing, but if you want to see a beautifully shot film with some very cool action sequences, this is the movie for you. I went into the movie not expecting a lot after seeing all of the reviews for it, but I actually ended up really enjoying myself as I watched it. Sure it is not a great movie, but why would any one expect it to be? It was a fun movie, and the main actors played their parts well enough. Overall if you are bored while it's in theatres and want to see a fun movie or if you are looking for something to do one night once it is on DVD, this wouldn't be a bad pick."
"TheGreatMarkukini","4","1","2","21 June 2019"," Sweating as a pig before the slaughter
","Once, years ago, I have watched the original 'Point Break' with slim Keanu Reeves and extreme Patrick Swayze and, as always, the remake news made me shiver. So, trying to get enjoyment from the movie I have decided to block all the past memories and that's what happened.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, the ideas intersect but many points are different that earns respect for creators. Love that here the main drug for the criminals, the fuel for endeavors is adrenaline. This allows us to be witnesses of wild tricks that make your hands and back sweat like crazy. The intensity delivers the approach of the breaking point where mind sends the signals to stop but the blood rush forces you to continue.<br/><br/>The plotline itself let me down by being kind of chewed: the scenes seems to be in chronological order but then suddenly the scene pops without any sufficient justification just to show yet another high morale talk with charming ambiance.<br/><br/>Returning to an elephant in the room. Although the struggles were made to avoid shot-by-shot remake a bit of iconic moments jumped into the frame and my brain screamed: ""It is dumb to put it here!!"". Not only scraps of scenes visited us from the past but also the characters with their names freshened the spirits of old times.<br/><br/>Honestly, nobody would notice the name change - meaning that every fan would appreciate a difference rather then not a good tribute. I am not talking about Luke Bracey and Edgar Ramirez because they did quite a good job, however, the latter could have been less philosophical. I was underscoring Ray Winstone's Pappas that in my opinion was a bleak reminiscence of Gary Busey.<br/><br/>Still shaking from the enormous bursts of adrenaline I would say that the remake as expected didn't work out in a good way but presented with more than formidable extreme portrayal of action that deserves an applause. The problem is that I would rather find the compilation of the tricks on YouTube that rewatch the movie."

Without giving a spoiler, the ""bad"" guys that the FBI agent is trying to expose actually have a good reason for what they are doing - but it is completely misplaced in the plot and it has nothing to do with the original thematic thread of the original make of this movie. The lead actor simply doesn't act. He's just a sporty-guy. There was some good extreme sports scenes, but nothing more than one might find on YouTube, otherwise, bad acting, boring and trite plot. The original make of this movie with Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze was the cream. Too bad because there are a few decent names in this new rendering.

"juanmuscle","10","2","7","2 May 2016"," Firstly, huge fan of the first...
","Secondly, I defy anyone to watch this film eating something, you will find yourself topsy-turvy with your meal everywhere but inside your open maw. Due to the remarkable camera work, the film was able to capture every crucial move with acute depth and nimble perception as if reading a well descriptive prose novel. This team went well and beyond what is standard film directing; and the results produced something Definitely Cool, Narly and Rad! lol.... It bespeaks to us here today, of something greater than ourselves - it picks up where its predecessor left off and as it should, a sagacious writer of the seminal persuasion really hit home with this really cool idea. In time immemorial, we go into journeys to personal enlightenment whilst touching on the plight of modern society in a foretaste to the folly of man and its attendant pitfalls looming darkly over the crimson wavelet cresting over the vast planetary skyline. Whilst the latter, this one here today, is more of an explosive in your face all out worldly blitz of manic clusterF high intensity pure lunacy! There is just not enough time to really build characters and their attendant relationships, but in the nonce, when the world is barely hanging on the fulcrum of its natural axis, it is impossible to maintain any normalcy while cultivating healthy relationships. And if we are to save this planet, our planet from spinning off its axis, caroming into some other dead world whereupon a massive megaton explosion and off the entire universe with which we threaten all of vast tenebrous darkly space with our toxic noxious pollutant disgusting human remains, we need to definitely do something and do it now, like for example, recycle, eat less meat, stop procreating, read a lil' more classic literature and work on new fuel sources, now this might not seem as titillating as flying out of stuff and dive into planetary holes and Then engage the parachutes without dashing thy heads against the retaining trackless walls. I don't know, we all have to do our part and I'm a lil' afraid of heights. <br/><br/>That is to say, Here and now, 20 something, all around us, all about us, we exist in a ClusterF of chaos. We simply do not have the luxury to luxuriate in any personal journey for we have brought our very planet of bliss to a veritable graveyard resting on the rocks of a sickly charnel house as we float with indifferent despair to our imminent doom. Our chance is now, our domain hangs in the balance, our every choice verily affects whether we live to see tomorrow or we all collectively bring mother nature crumbling to a world wide cataclysm so severe it will make the great flood look like ""The small wavelets next to the big Bowdie big boy waves in the first point break"" lol. When our hedonistic f-all attitudes come to head to head at the bloody pernicious confluence with the Terminal End. But luckily we have a few young men fighting for a chance at achieving 'The Big 8' and expose the error of our selfish ways as we plunder blindly through the vast stratospheres of our ether sucking, and drinking, and warring and Fn our way into a dismal future for a non-existing posterity. ON the whole with a theme nearing a propinquity to that of Armageddon (Although a lil' obfuscated as to how they are going to show the world their legendary prospects with no camera) But OK, I buy it anyhow, Trust me, under the severe theme or plot or both, there is a really cool, fun, narly flix here. It tears through conventional action scenes with its supersonic, flying in the face of the inextricable yoke of the humdrum redundancy which has plagued the creative world since the dawning of chalk or a stick in the sand, it simply kicks major ass and does it with style. I will say, the film needed to be a lil' longer, probably a series, to really build on each character, define the dangerous prospects, reach out to us with the feral of inter-connectivity with which we weave in and out of the filaments of relationships, in order to keep us there, with the true meaning of the theme, which would thereby bring about a tremendous feel for the amazing awesomeness of this ""Sequel?"" For this flix truly was awesome, totally! Hey, Bowdie could have swam back from that big wave way back when perhaps, came out in a younger format, with an accent, maybe? I don't know...."

","I'm a huge fan of the 1991 original. It's one of my all time favorite movies actually. So of course, I had to see this remake. My advice is: Don't compare it to the original, because it's not trying to be the original, just enjoy for what it is. Why? Because it has some great action scenes that couldn't have been easy to film and clearly required a lot of effort, thinking and planning. Visually, it's quite stunning and captivating. Seeing the characters just living life and doing all these cool things in all these exotic places made me dread going back to work. Nothing beats the original, but this is also a cool movie that I'd rewatch again for the overall vibe it has and the feeling it gives you and leaves with you. Same as the first one in that regard, but minus the legendary bromance between Keanu & Swayze. The creators of this movie wouldn't have made this without being huge fans of the original, so they knew full well the task they were up to. Bottom line: Solid remake with its own cool vibe, just enjoy it without comparison."

"tyingling7766","6","1","3","6 April 2017"," Point Break Review
","Point Break of 2015 could have been called anything else and it would have been a better movie. So, let's get going on this.<br/><br/>Synopsis: A young FBI agent infiltrates an extraordinary team of extreme sports athletes he suspects of masterminding a string of unprecedented, sophisticated corporate heists. Deep undercover, and with his life in danger, he strives to prove these athletes are the architects of the mind-boggling crimes that are devastating the world's financial markets. Starring: Edgar Ramirez, Luke Bracey Director: Ericson Core<br/><br/>Here's where the problem lies with this movie: Because of the name a lot of people compared this movie to the original. My thoughts on that are the fact there have been other movies out there that have used the same story line. A rookie cop goes undercover to try to stop a bunch of robbers committing crimes. Hmmm? Wasn't there a movie that came out in 2001 with that same plot line? You know, one that involved cars? There's like eight of those movies now. They just keep getting better. I can't remember what it's called though.<br/><br/>So, anyway, jokes aside. The movie wasn't a bad movie. It seemed they just sort of said towards the end, ""Well, I don't know what to do here."" The ending had no excitement to it. It was the biggest let down to the entire movie.<br/><br/>The actors didn't do too bad for the type of movie it is. There was no way this movie was going to get Oscar worthy performances, and I wasn't expecting anything. I wish they would have gotten the original choice to play Bodhi in Gerard Butler, but Ramirez did okay. Again, it came down to everyone comparing actors.<br/><br/>Not only should they have changed the name for the movie, they should have changed the name of the characters. This movie was doomed in a lot of people's eyes before it even came out.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was the practicality of it. Ericson Core made a decision to use real locations and little to none CGI in the movie. It worked for the movie. Probably extremely dangerous, but it worked. Sure it may have been a bit expensive, but it made the movie better. A lot people would use substitutes for locations, this movie made it so you could understand the beauty what the guys were trying to do.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: All they had to do was change six characters names and the name of the movie. It would have been at least a star better.<br/><br/>Rating: 6 out of 10"

But the stunts, colors, action, and cinematography are fulfilling and fantastic. You could tell the whole stunt and design team put their hearts into creating some EPIC extreme sports scenes for this movie. I'd be really proud of the movie as a whole if I worked on it.<br/><br/>If you can get past some of the glaring issues you'll find a very enjoyable movie underneath. The casting isn't so bad. You can watch some very beautiful people try and emasculate each other for 2 hours."

In this remake I don't know where's the story, the characters were underdeveloped and it rushed towards the end with plenty of high octane action sequences everywhere. This formula won't work all the time like '300' and 'Fury Road', but it's really good for watching in digital 3D.<br/><br/>The story was kind of sameness, but slightly altered, especially about that 8 ordeal and stunts were obviously freshly designed. The graphic works were weak in some parts, it failed to give a natured effect. Yeah, I think CGI is the issue, the movie relied on it for everything.<br/><br/>The cast performances were fine, but a big star in the lead might have given a different result.

It is quickly (a little too quickly possibly) established that the suspects are following a series cultish, zen like trials known as The Okuza Eight. A series of dangerous missions around the world that test even the greatest athletes. The premise is well updated from the original Reeves/Swayze film of the early 90's with more to do with saving the planet and paying back what they take. But they just happen to have all these amazing natural phenomena happen one after the other in perfect synchronicity allowing the group of renegades to chase the thrill around the world. The film used the obligatory CGI whenever and where ever possible when it wasn't even needed, quite often it would have been cheaper and quicker to just film the actors on the water rather than green screen it, where as the snow scenes seemed to be real. As for the casting it seemed like everyone was a replacement, we spent the entire film calling out who was meant to play the role, i.e Utah should have been Chris Hemsworth, Samsara should have been Kristen Stewart and Jonathon Tucker (Jay Kulina in Kingdom) should have played Roach, etc. Sure there were enough holes to fill a golf course but it still did 'alright' for a remake. But why remake it in the first place? It's not like the 1990's is so long ago that time has forgotten it, or that surfing has change that much in 20 years that it needed a remake (like Footloose made no sense with cassette tapes and ghetto blasters, it needed to be remade). Still its worth a watch and recommended :)"

","'Point Break' is a movie which should be reviewed with comparison of thrill, action and adventure with Hollywood standard. If it is to be compared normally with the previous version of the movie (as assumed) 'Point Break (1991)' star caste by Keanu Reeves, was a far better approach although it was more than a decade old from this. This contemporary movie lacked the in-depth passion and devotion of Keanu Reeves firstly by the leading role Luke Bracey. Secondly, it is not a perfect thriller nor action or adventure by category. Rather it is a mixed up of all these categories so that, it does not fall appropriately into any of these categories. Thirdly, protagonist character of positive side is much more blurred than the protagonist negative character which was seemed not the utmost intention of director or script writer.

","Well this movie was interesting enough, apart from the ridiculously clichéd, badly tattooed characters...and the ridiculous storyline and the inane disregard for wearing helmets. <br/><br/>Consistently every time the 'crew' entered a dangerous situation wearing helmets, as soon as they fell or took the chase/battle to the next level they had to remove their helmets. Fall off a bike? take of the helmet... Getting shot at and took one in the gut? take off your helmet. no need for that shiz when you're a hard as nails extreme sports athlete. <br/><br/>And whats with the chick 'roofy-ing' this dude, every time he had an emotional/sexual encounter with the chick, he woke up the next day disoriented and just cruises on with the fact that he had just been possibly date-raped against his will, seems to me like they're trivializing the rape game, and only because its a reasonable looking girl she gets away with this devious crime unpunished. <br/><br/>The saving grace was the bad-as-s' cliff climbing sequence which had me shitting my pants with anticipation, solid stuff. <br/><br/>but back to the 'bullshiz', opening scenes, who the hell packs money for international shipping just with a net over it, seems a bit susceptible to the average baggage handler pickpocketing himself a nice wad of cash, but made it much easier for them to waste countless dollars cutting the net thousands of feet up in the air where it would blow all over the godda mn rain-forest and lost forever with the few little settlements getting a little sprinkling of that paper goodness. Surely the 'should've' let the crates fall as a whole, so it would be in a concentrated area, further portraying these 'extreme dudes' as small minded 'dumbasses'. <br/><br/>Again with the gold heist, wasted into nothing in that rock-slide scenario. and with dropping the diamonds out of an airplane into a dirty little shack village in the middle of nowhere. 1 the majority of those diamonds would be lost forever in the mud and 2 how the hell are these poverty stricken peeps supposed to have a diamond trader in their network of mates. <br/><br/>Coupling those oversights with the ridiculously superhuman feats of extreme sporting, from taking 100m drops on dirt bikes after half a mountain avalanches behind them to falling of what seems to be at least a 250-god-damn-metre-high waterfall, dudes are built harder than wolverine for gods sake. also their methods defy rational though but yet they manage to pull it off in this movie, i.e jumping off a moving fisherman boat (driving out to sea) into a 100ft wave moving the opposite direction and making it look like 'child's play'.<br/><br/>To sum up, good for a light watch if you love picking apart impossible feats of extremeness, with pretty bland acting and no 'hot chicks' to distract from it, I would give this a score of 3 buckets of bullshizzz out of 5 and 4 knickerbocker glory moments of averageness out of 10. Apparently the original is much better according to a ginger dread-lock 'rastafari' next to me, but that remains to be seen."

Reminding viewers of a Red Bull YouTube real, nearly 75 professional extreme athletes and stunt performers —surfers, climbers, snowboarders, divers, proximity flyers, motocross racers, long boarders, and more— work together to contribute their skills to make intense scenes all over the world. Professionally and tastefully captured, these scenes cause viewers' hearts to leap and their stomachs to drop. In one scene Johnny Utah and Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez), the athletes' leader, perform a suspenseful free climb, no ropes, to the very top of beautiful Angel Falls. Upon reaching the top, Utah reprimands Bodhi for the laws he has broken and tries to arrest him. Bodhi responds, ""The only law that matters is gravity"" and jumps off the cliff. However suspenseful and intriguing, if looked at as a re-boot of the 1991 version of Point Break the film falls extremely short, ignoring nearly the entire original storyline and plot to create something new yet extreme. Although Point Break (2015) may disappoint fans of the original still remains an awe- inspiring, adrenaline rushing, must-see film."

","Again like other remakes of days gone by, they have to be more bigger, and livelier, and in some case, more unbelievable. This remake, made famous all those years, by the very cool 1992 original, I still enjoyed more, and seriously that was a better movie. But if you go into one, in 3D, too, PLEASE, get ready for a cool ride, with awesomely breathtaking stunts, one involving our foursome, partaking in a lengthy paragliding sequence which was just riveting. It's like watching 4 bats, or those futuristic jets in those latest science fiction-Terminator/Transformers flicks. What I also liked about this, was the change of story, highly original, where this two our posse of robbers are not stealing for themselves. There a couple of familiar moments of cool agent Utah (Bracey-Home And Away material) shooting a score of pointless gunshots off skyward, or the end too, (bigger, and more spectacular). For this one, you have to leave your brain at the door, and surrender to the escapism, much like the last Fast And Furious flick. Why was I disappointed though?-sorry to be a pain, but plot development was really needed here, where from watching the trailer, I was expecting much more, in terms of that. I loved Ray Winstone's performance, for what screen time he had, replacing that of Busey's from the first (I like this Pappas character better). The delicious Teresa Palmer was of course, Teresa Palmer, only appearing in a number of scenes here and there, one of course, having to be a sex scene, where she was totally wasted. This time, Utah, not having an a..hole of a boss, was played by Delroy Lindo, who did the role solid. This was a remake I did like, for a few different reasons. It's much different, refreshingly different, and it really succeeded here. Ramirez giving a different take on Bohdi, was one I liked, where I really wanted him to walk away, or surf away. Quite a bit of the stunts are just unfeasible, and it's explosive tragic start, you will learn from, or question why you would risk such a stunt, in the first place. This remake will teach you, not to do stupid s..t. The waves too, are bigger, much bigger, as everything else. The day party scene on the water with a sea of hotties and the male race, familiar to that of the first piranha. Though, this is such a fun ride, and I demand you do see it, for the experience, I will still opt for the original, any day."

","First of all, this movie could have been amazing if the screenwriters had stayed the course. The Eco-Warrior motivation is timely and awesome, but it dissolved into absurdity. In addition, the criminals were so much better than the original except Bodhi should have looked more like an enlightened Buddha. The main character was not convincing. Jax from Son of Anarchy would have been more intense and believable. There were many parts of the script that should have been changed before filming. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, but with my suggested changes, this movie could have become a Flashdance sensation. Instead, it will only be remembered for what it should have been and not what it was. The special effects were awesome and I want to live in France forever."

","A deeply pleasing reboot (modernisation) of a classic. Awesome cinematography and amazing stunts. I like the changes in the plot and how it borrows from the original rather than trying to copy it.

I think this also opens up the possibilities of further stories and I like the new Johnny Utah! I have seen a lot of negative comments towards it but I don't agree... It isn't taking anything away from the original.. It is very different I think by some people's reaction that they believe the original movie ceases to exist upon release of the reboot.

","I have seen the 1991 version a couple of times because I love it! When I was watching the beginning of the 2015 version I was surprised by the bad reviews. I had read those before I finally decided to see the 2015 version anyway ... <br/><br/>GREAT how Bodhi and his team made their statement to society by their thrilling robberies. BUT, after those robberies the amount of ""irrelevant"" action gets out of balance with the story. Although the action is astonishing I was glad that I remembered the story of the 1991 version because otherwise I might have been lost. At that point the 2015 version felt like watching a movie based on a book that I read before watching the movie; that can be pretty disappointing. Overall the 2015 version lacked the feeling that I have when I watch the 1991 version. <br/><br/>BUT (again) ... the 2015 version is significantly different! We're almost 25 years ahead of the 1991 version and times have changed. The 2015 version is more bombastic and even more sentimental. It becomes shallow due to the amount of irrelevant action scenes. STILL, the story of the 2015 version actually has more depth than the 1991 version. The story of the 1991 version is actually a bit shallow; it's about a couple of guys living it up, and stealing from banks to finance their fun (and some spirituality). The banks get paid by the insurance companies and nobody gets hurt and in a way ""everybody"" seems to win. This is typical for the beginning of the nineties. However, simply ""living it up by stealing"" doesn't suffice anymore. We really DO need to care about nature and our environment! Bodhi was inspired by his spiritual leader to do so. And with that in mind it explains why he's more serious and grim than the 1991 Bodhi. SUPER!<br/><br/>At home I watched the 1991 version again and I must say that the quality of the way the story is presented is more appealing to me. Possibly it's my age and because I cannot get into the use of social media such as twitter and Facebook. The 1991 version tells a story by the dialogues between people. The 2015 version provides an impression of a story by TWEETS between allegories. <br/><br/>All in all I do recommend to see the 2015 version, especially when you've seen the 1991 version. It's a roller-coaster and the essence of the story of the 2015 version is actually a lot better. It shows spiritual growth on one hand and on the other hand, a lack of growth in relevant use of action. <br/><br/>And again ... the action is fantastic!"

","Guys, this is a good movie. Obviously, it's not as good as the original, but that was pretty clear from the beginning. I didn't expect much from this movie and one afternoon I was really in the mood for going to cinema and decided to give this movie a chance. At least it looked good for cinema so I thought I couldn't go wrong with it because I'll at least have fun. And I was very pleasantly surprised!<br/><br/>The original movie is awesome and one of my favorites and good thing about this one is that it tried to be something different so it's not just same thing again. While the original is just surfing and skydiving, this one is focused on extreme sports much more and if you are going to see it for surfing you won't see much of that because it's only in two scenes (but still very good scenes). The movie is very well shot and action scenes are eye candy. Actors are not as good as Patrick Sawyze and Keanu Reeves but they are pretty good.<br/><br/>People are criticizing this movie way too much just because it's a remake but there are still flaws. There is almost no character development at all. Maybe just a little with two main characters, but the rest are so forgettable they might have as well put dummies instead of actors. And also a few plot holes, but if people forgive all those ridiculous moments to the Fast & Furious franchise, I'll do the same with this, and also, this is in my opinion a better movie than Furious 7.<br/><br/>This movie is not boring at all and it's full of well done action sequences and it's absolutely worth watching. I will not even call it a guilty pleasure, because I'll always defend this movie when someone starts complaining about it. If you don't mind remakes, you'll probably like this. And if you don't like remakes, then just don't watch this, simple!"

It's no masterpiece, but it's the best at being what it is.

","Stunts and cinematography of the extreme sports were impressive and kept the film alive, otherwise it's a poorly scripted, unrealistic remake of the original 1991 Point Break that we all fondly remember. If you never saw that one and have a below level intellect, you'll love this film for its action. It lacks big name actors, is annoyingly far-fetched and the dialogue is pedantic at times. My expectations were dashed, I can forgive it for wandering from the plot into a new 'Ozarki 8' legend, but the whole story was a bit weak to be honest. None of the actors really stood out, but their exploits wing-suiting, and snowboarding and dirt biking make it worth watching. For a new generation it's still a movie deserving of an audience."

There's a lot of amazing stunts, but some kept going on and on, which is sad, if it was a little less it would've been way better. The reveal of Utah as a cop was also very weak, when you see the original it tends to leave you on the end of the seat in that department. You also expect Utah to do more at the end of the movie, while that's not the case which was a big let down. The ending was very weak and probably ruined the movie for more people. Next to that, the shots were very good and the directing was very good. Personally I liked the story, but not for this type of movie. I'd rather see a sport/adventure movie in a story like this, completing 8 heists doing the most dangerous stunts, something like that. I give it a solid 6,5 though, it kept me watching."

","This film is packed to the brim with some absolutely fantastic action sequences covering almost any extreme sport that you can imagine. As the title implies, it's all about taking it all to the max - taking each challenge to it's most impossible and dangerous. If you like watching YouTube clips of people doing these kinds of stunts in real life, then you'll enjoy this movie. The action is very well shot and the backdrop for many of the scenes is stunning.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there's more to a movie than just action. The plot is ridiculous and, to be honest, a bit too fast paced for it's own good. It goes from one thing to the next within seconds, with no buildup in between. We are teleported rapidly between scenes and it just seems a bit too much - they've just tried to cram too much into the movie to make it coherent. On top of this the character development is extremely limited and the characters' motives are completely nonsensical.<br/><br/>Overall, though, it was a decent enough watch and I certainly don't regret spending the time to view it, but I am left disappointed by the whole structure. As we have seen with the Mission Impossible and James Bond franchises, there is a way to weld together great action and an excellent storyline, but here the latter seems to have been pushed aside. For me, it feels like unfulfilled potential. They did the expensive bits right but forgot about making them work together. Bit of a shame, really."

","""Point Break"" is an Action - Crime movie in which we watch a young FBI agent trying to become a part of a very special team which consists of extreme sports athletes. He wants to become a part of it because he suspects that they are sophisticated corporate heists. Since he is going to be undercover for this mission he tries his very best in order to be accepted from the team and gain their trust. His life will be in danger and he has to prove to these athletes that he is one of them since they hunt the legend of the Ozaki 8 and are ready to do anything in order to achieve this goal.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because it had a very unique and interesting plot. It was a very different crime movie from all the crime movies I had already watched because a lot of sports were involved. I liked the direction which was made by Ericson Core and I believe he did a great job on it since he combined very well many action scenes with sports and also the connection between the characters of the movie was very well placed. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I liked the interpretation of Luke Bracey who played as Johnny Utah and Edgar Ramírez who played as Bodhi.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I have to say that ""Point Break"" is a nice action movie with a decent plot and some good interpretations. If you are a fan of action movies then you should watch it because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much and you are going to have a lot of fun.

","I have enjoyed watching this reboot of a classic film. I like both films, but I tend to be much more of a ""both/and"" kind of film aficionado than an ""either/or"" type. The actors all knew their lines, spoke with the sort of authority of those who have become their respective characters wholly, passionately and very convincingly. It is a brave film. The world has always been a very violent place. ""In a world where anything goes, judgement is everything."" One of my favorite high school counselors imparted that wisdom to me in 1983 when the school we both served in was stunned by a movie about the nuclear destruction of the world. Many teachers presented and discussed it; and counselors and additional professional people were on hand to provide solace, clarity, comfort, and advocacy. The film dramatizes what is humanly possible in terms of mind/body and soul. Socrates insisted and I still insist that ""The unexamined life is not worth living."" Ideas don't hurt people; fear of using our God given critical thinking gifts is what produces a Charles Manson, an Adolf Hitler, or a Boston Marathon fanatic. <br/><br/>I love experiencing something via a book or a film, a lecture, anecdote, or reminiscence that vicariously imparts to me important truths; whether to accept or reject them is not up to a producer, director, or the performers. However, just as I would not attempt to explain the workings of a reciprocating engine to my new grand daughter, not every work of art is ready to be viewed, understood, and appreciated for what it is and what it is not. <br/><br/>This film or clips from it would have provided a novel, sensory, discussion-worthy prompt for a film class, a creative writing group, or any audience that appreciates expanding their experiences in life.<br/><br/>Were I still teaching Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition to high school seniors, I would couple this movie with the original 1991 ""Point Break"" along with ""Donnie Brasco"" for students to fully explore in a scholarly essay investigating synonymous, antithetical and synthetic parallels."

","POINT BREAK is another of the pointless remakes that have been the bane of Hollywood for the last couple of decades. This time around, it's the turn of the well remembered Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze-starrer of 1991. Aussie TV actor Luke Bracey takes on the Reeves role but fails to make much impact at all; he's certainly not sympathetic and he doesn't have that wide-eyed curiosity that Keanu brought to the role. Edgar Ramirez takes on the Swayze character but comes across as rather bland and perhaps miscast in what is an underwritten part. This film benefits from some great photography, with lots of rugged terrain and one jaw-dropping surfing sequence which might well be the best ever filmed. Sadly, the characters are shallow, the plot contrived, and nobody is remotely likeable. There are a few decent action scenes but, as nearly always, I'd reocmmend going with the original instead."

","*Note: I haven't seen the original version of this movie. <br/><br/>Plot: 7/10. FBI agent who also happens to be an extreme sports athlete infiltrates a group of extreme sports athletes who also happen to be eco-terrorists hellbent on completing the Ozaki 8 ordeals, a set of extreme sports ordeals, while also ""giving back"" to Mother Earth (read: committing crimes) and trying to save the planet from destruction. Have to say, this is by far one of the most original and inventive plots I've come across for a crime movie. Points off for a couple instances of poor executions/research (I study terrorism, so I pick up on this easily in these movies): 1. Bodhi telling Utah that he ""knew he was a cop from the beginning, but thought he could save him"" - this would NEVER happen in any extremist group ever. I get that they weren't a terrorist group in the original movie, but if you want to make them terrorists, you have to change the way you do things a little. 2. The whole thing about Bodhi being on the boat with Ozaki when he died, I mean... sure, it gives him motivation, but could we be any more predictable? 3. The romantic subplot between the girl and Utah was literally thrown in there for the sake of it and added nothing whatsoever to the plot. Furthermore, the one ""important"" female character was literally a sexy lamp and didn't participate in any of the group's activities until it came time for her to die for the male lead to have feels. 4. Another instance of ""these weren't initially terrorists but they are now"" poor execution: not that I don't understand that he wanted to complete the Ozaki 8, but no terrorist ever would just do something he knew was going to kill him without benefit to his cause. Again, maybe this was believable in the original movie, but it is not believable here. <br/><br/>Characters: 7/10. I loved the character chemistry between Bodhi and Utah. Points off for no development of literally any other character. Especially in the case of Sexy Lamp lady who croaks for Man Tears. <br/><br/>Cinematography: 10/10. Absolutely visually stunning movie. This is definitely the high point of the film, especially for the extreme sports fans among us. <br/><br/>Atmosphere: 8/10.

","Yes, the characters and motivations are fairly shallow, although enviro-spiritualism should be recognizably trendy. Yet, the action and the scenery is inspiring. In comparison, this is like a Bond movie : 1) Bad guy willing to to use any means to an end meets good guy trying to stop him. 2) Good guy and bad guy might even find some shared values and love interests. 3) Together they race through beautiful scenery with sometimes implausible technological assists. 4) Creating a bit of suspense amidst a lot of amazing visual perspectives. I generally rate Bond movies 6 to 8. This Point Break remake is at least as good as Bond action and better in some ways - mainly it's a bit more plausible. Instead of a super spy and diabolical bad guy both with unreal tech tools, it's 'sort of real' extreme athletes doing radically dangerous action. Just enjoy the scenery and stunt action."

Instead we get the same idiotic dialog, and the same ridiculous behavior (""let's accept random strangers into our tight club because the universe tells me to"") as the first time round. <br/><br/>The one thing this movie does better than its predecessor is that the action sequences/stunts, and the scenery are vastly superior.

"FallenEye","5","0","1","20 November 2016"," Pointless Break
","For a movie that is about thrills, stunts and exhilaration, it sure did lack in excitement or any type of suspense. Maybe its weak point was, the sheer fearlessness. Utah, Bodhi and Co. had such little fear that, you really couldn't sense any danger... There was damn near literally, zero danger.<br/><br/>The closest to suspense this movie got was when they were rock climbing... and that too wasn't all that, exciting. Even the way Grommet just accepted his fate... Was, so ordinary. These guys push fear and show it no respect, then you have Utah reacting when fear pushes back. Utah acts without fear, then gets riddled by guilt when consequences arise.<br/><br/>Teresa Palmer, though she is very, very pretty, then sometimes not - she's weird that way - was playing an incredibly flat character. Samsara was quite avoidable in this film, and only seemed like some kind of eye candy. Sure, many movies have that, but here, it felt too obvious.<br/><br/>This version is better than its original mainly, if not only based on technical aspects, such as cinematography and composition... Two aspects that have a lot to do with this time vs that time.<br/><br/>From there, the progression felt a little incoherent, the acting from Edgar and Luke felt a bit too much, then a bit little... Then a bit too lack luster. The 8 Ordeals approach was meant to make the movie much fresher than the '91 version, but failed dismally... How, I'm not even sure.<br/><br/>I'll give Point Break 5/10, only because it didn't inspire anything in me. It was what it was, and that is the end of that. I may be a little harsh, but...

","Warning: Spoilers<br/><br/>So I finally watched this...I had been really hesitant because I loved the original by Katherine Bigelow and worried that if I watched it, it would ruin the original for me. It didn't. The good news is that it is basically a totally different storyline than the original and won't in any way, distract from re-watching the original. The bad news is it was a pretty horrible attempt at a re-boot.<br/><br/>1) The very premise of the original was that ""Bodhi"" was this incredibly charismatic guy, who ""Utah"" was ""drawn"" to because of that connection and was conflicted between his job and his feelings. None of that came through in the film, nor did the suspense. 2) Edgar Ramirez, who is a talented actor; but in this film, with this script, with this director, was flat and not in any way charismatic; which makes everything pseudo-unbelievable as far as Utah's draw to him. When Bodhi pulled out the ""bro"" finger pistol on the yacht ,I was almost done. If this is what writers and directors ""think"" an enlightened, spiritual man, and I've shared time with a few, act like, I'm both horrified and terrified...3) The premise is not bad, and the action sequences not horrible, but there's no passion in the acting or characters, as Bodhi would say...""No Beauty"". 4) They would have been better off making this a ""net new""....meaning, say, Bodhi's illegitimate son that he never knew being chased by an FBI agent; or Utah's son going after a new ""spiritual seeker"" as opposed to trying to force the characters and names from the original into the new one. It was more distracting than it was enticing or believable. Reboots are for James Bond, Star Wars and Batman, who have a long history of switching out the leads. This should have been a follow-on, not an attempted reboot. 5) Luke Bracey gives a pretty good performance. If the story said that it was ""Johnny Utah's"" son who took up extreme sports, it would be believable, and nothing he did pulled you out of the film, despite the occasional dumb lines in the script. 6) Delroy Lindo gives another good performance, although perfunctory enough to wonder if budget was an issue. He would have made a much better ""older partner"" than Ray Winsotne. How was that decision made???? Talented actor with history of similar roles gets banged to essentially a guest spot? I hope that was a scheduling issue, not an outright casting decision. The relationship between Utah and Pappas was the other key element missing. It was palpable in the original, completely missing in this one. 7) Teresa Palmer is charismatic as always and provides the only real surprise in the film....no not giving that spoiler away, but her character was good, even with the limited development in the script. 8) Scenery shots and action sequences were good and the basic premise, the Ozaki 8, was actually pretty clever if they had been executed well and the message was good and would resonate with a better script.<br/><br/>My2C Jen"

Peter Iliff screenplay to incorporate a) more extreme sports; and b) more aspects indicative of the present generation, great cinematography and both Delroy Lindo and Ray Winstone--who are both 'cash money' in terms of great supporting actors.<br/><br/>Disadvantages include awful soundtrack choices, a highly-unbelievable and lazily-written, underdeveloped script, the actors selected aren't nearly in the class of Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey and Lori Petty...and the director's no Kathryn Bigelow.<br/><br/>Good for a watch, out of curiosity, especially if you liked the original and are a fan of extreme sports. Otherwise, it's probably not worth your time."

","Possibly the dumbest movie ever made? No, not really. It IS the dumbest movie ever made. The basis is mindless stunts proving absolutely nothing and glorifying the least common denominator in skill. Want to do something dangerous and skillful? Become a professional racing driver.<br/><br/>The losers in this film do dangerous stunts because, frankly, they aren't capable of doing anything of consequence. Don't waste your time on this trashy film. Of course, if you do something stupid then you can survive until the end, shake the hand of the equally stupid FBI agent, and then go ahead and die to what, redeem yourself from the crime and deaths you caused in the previous 90 minutes? This film, and its lack of values and morals, is exactly what is wrong with America and the entertainment industry today. Welcome to 1984."

","I enjoyed it. Visually appealing. Although there are minimal action scenes there are enough extreme sport scenes to make up. The message is a little eschewed from the original movie, but hey, you have to change the appeal a little bit when you're dealing with a different generation. The message of searching for ones path and the blurred lines between right and wrong, good and evil. Life and living. It can be told a million different ways, so there is no right way to explain this. The only problem here is this movie lacks the balance to explain. It jumps and hops around like the various stunts it attempts and can really lose the story at times. Other than all that, it's a good watch. There is some replay potential here. Enjoy it without holding on to the original cult-classic. Otherwise you may disappoint yourself."

","As a comparison to Point Break this movie falls short, but as an independent action / adventure flick it's awesome. Plot could use some work, but the visual effects and stunts are incredibly entertaining. The cinematography and aerial scenes are epic and showcase some of the most beautiful global locations.If this was re-released as a search to accomplish the Ozaki 8 this movie would be a hit. I found the story line around the Ozaki 8 to be very entertaining and better suited for the plot and story-line. The association with the original Point Break is unfortunate because it detracts from the amazing stunt work. I really hope more people give this movie a chance."

","The movie is about beliefs and how far someone is willing to go to honour those beliefs. <br/><br/>Real-life link-since this is an action movie I will not judge if all the actions are possible or not because it is understandable that most of them will be exaggerated for entertainment purposes. Where I found the link to be true is that it is quite common to do some of the most extraordinary actions in order to accomplish what you believe is important. Finding your path. That was highlighted. It was implied that if you find your path you find your purpose and when you find your purpose its then when you are happy. And I do believe that accomplishments lead to happiness. We can just imply that Bodhi died happy but we were never shown it. Also a good life lesson try by stressing that we are only possible for our own path, actions and choices. But is that true? Is that true when you also are the encouragement of someones actions like Utah was for his friend? Encouraging someone to follow you is also an action that had tragic consequences. Should you not be responsible for that? <br/><br/>Character analysis: Utah was a very poor developed character. A confusing character. I never quite understood what were his motives for joining the FBI. Why did he want to become a part of the FBI so bad? Body on the other hand was way better developed. He had more depth and a clear aim, path, vision that was ready to do anything to accomplish what he believed was his purpose.<br/><br/>The movie had a good plot however the development of the movie was weak in many points. For example, they failed (with the exception of the climbing scene) to show us that the tasks were as extreme as they say they are. For example, if competing the task when they fly was so difficult, how come all of them (including Utah that was some kind of a amateur) completed it? It did not come across how difficult the tasks were. They looked easy. Also, the fact that Utah finds the group so easily and immediately without challenges, shows a weakness of this movie.<br/><br/>In general however, the movie is quite entertaining. It starts interesting, keeps you interested when Utah blows his cover and just when you think that that was the highpoint of the movie there comes the scene with the climbing. When you think that that was it and that Bodhi died there you have the final scene where he dies after completing is path. <br/><br/>What I thought was gonna happen is that after Bodhi died, Utah went to accomplish the water task in Bodhi's and others honour but I was wrong and the ending so was quite a surprise for me."

","People hate on it so much because they expect a copy of the 1991 Point Break. Well, this is a modern version of the original Point Break and it is not meant to be the same. If it was to be the same, why would they even bother to make it? First of all, this movie should be appreciated because of the amazing extreme scenes. I would recommend it to people who really enjoy watching great views and extreme sports. The stupid thing is the banal ""FBI agent"" sh*t but I think I could get over it as it is an American movie, no way it doesn't include the FBI. However, the movie has its charm, and do the characters. The characters of Bodhi and Samsara are intriguing and exclusively charming. I really like how the movie is about spirituality and fighting your own self. But it's a bit saddening if you get attached to the characters and see things sentimentally. You have the typical FBI thing, the extreme sports, the sentimental moments, the parties, the beautiful sense of risking your life to help others and to take your spirit higher. It has beautiful moments of joy, terrifying moments and great scenes. Why would I not like it?"
"TxMike","Null","0","2","28 May 2016"," Very different remake of the 1991 movie of the same name.
","My wife and I saw this on Blu-ray from our public library. It is a remake of sorts of the 1991 movie with Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze but it gets to its conclusion in a quite different sequence of events.<br/><br/>The first thing I want to say about this version, especially on Blu-ray, the picture and sound are great. They used real experts in the various stunts and went to exotic, picturesque locations to film the stunts. The sound surrounds you as it should and the deep bass in certain scenes literally shakes you if your sound system has a really good powered subwoofer. So, even if a viewer doesn't particularly care for the story the visuals and sound are bound to please most viewers.<br/><br/>So, what is the story here? Australian actor Luke Bracey plays Utah, so named because he is part Ute Indian. He is a thrill seeker and as the movie opens we see him and his buddy doing some extreme motocross riding across hills in a badlands area. But his buddy loses it, Utah reevaluates his life, and seven years later we see him training to be an FBI agent, after finishing high school and also getting a college degree.<br/><br/>A series of seemingly unrelated crimes get Utah's attention and as a trainee approaches his superior, he thinks he knows what is going on and that they are connected. It involves some extreme sportsmen attempting to achieve 8 tasks that are thought to be impossible, as a way to achieve a higher plane of existence. But their quest is misguided in that they break laws and if innocent people die that is just part of their quest.<br/><br/>We find that the leader of this effort, which involves 3 others, is Edgar Ramírez as Bodhi. Utah's approach is to infiltrate the group, gain their respect and trust, then arrest them to stop the crimes.<br/><br/>Eye-candy is added by South African actress Teresa Palmer as Samsara, one of the group, who looks so good in a skimpy bikini that the screen of my TV almost melted. Her role isn't really necessary but it does provide a spice of sorts.<br/><br/>Well story-wise this is just a mediocre movie, but the stunts and scenery make the 1 hour and 45 minutes worth the watch for those of us who enjoy that sort of thing.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: In the original at his last encounter with Utah, Bodhi does his last stunt and disappears, presumed to have died. In this version, surfing a giant wave at sea, Bodhi disappears, presumed to have died. Utah is fast-tracked to get his official FBI designation."
"dangkoen","8","0","2","13 May 2016"," I got what I expected *SPOILERS AHEAD*
","This film was being slandered from it's announcement, simply because it was perceived as being a pointless remake. So many remakes of different genres were done that had no point & yet turned out to be good. It is the same case here.<br/><br/>The makers clarified it would be more of a reimagining of what was already seen, rather then a full on remake. In general, the acting is decent. The only rather flat performance I'd say came from Ray Winstone, mumbling through his lines. I love the fact most of the action is real time, rather then CGI. CGI is prominent in waves these days, it really feels refreshing to see some real stunt work. The cinematography is near outstanding as we follow the characters over various continents.<br/><br/>Especially positive about this film is that it shows the antagonists aren't idiots & figured Utah was a cop early on, a clever addition. The twist involving Samsara is sure to surprise viewers as well. Also loved how they had Bodhi rescue Utah from the wave, a nice homage to the original film & there are a few more in there :). What blends surprisingly well is the already familiar anti-establishment mentality of Bodhi's group & the new eco-terrorism angle. The dialogue concerning these state of minds is written in rather expositionary, but good enough substance.<br/><br/>Negatives involve some scenes & character introductions feeling rushed. The character Chowder (Tobias Santelmann)suffers the most from this flaw & his early demise makes his character a complete waste of screen time. Also the scene where Utah empties his gun in the air could have been handled better, & if that wasn't possible, should have been omitted from the film. Lastly the CGI during Bodhi's last wave looks rather sloppy, as it's clear the actors are standing in front of a green screen most of the time. And ironically, like the original film, the scene concerning Bodhi's last wave feels tagged on.<br/><br/>Nonetheless I really enjoyed this film & recommend you watch it with an open mind."

","Former Motocross rider John Utah (Luke Bracey) - now an FBI Agent - infiltrates a group of daredevils who perform heists with unbelievable success. Utah believes these extreme athletes are also performing the Ozaki 8: extreme feats to honor nature and some say that once completed the participants enter a state of Nirvana. You buy that?<br/><br/>Now, let's get real. The only reason to watch this movie is to watch the stunts whether in real time or CGI because they are truly unbelievable and there are many of them. All this may be movie magic, but WOW! Hope you are not afraid of heights as we see many beautiful scenes in extremely high mountains, and of course we see all this from the tops of these mountains. Hope you are not one to get dizzy. <br/><br/>What we see: Surfing with almost 80-foot waves, snowboarding down a mountain side, parachuting into a huge hole in the ground, outrunning a rock avalanche on a bike, flying down mountains in flying body suits, bike-riding on the edges of mountain-top ridges and a car chase on a very high and narrow mountain road. <br/><br/>The story of the FBI going after these criminals gets lost in the stunts as we are relegated to philosophical discussions about honoring Nature via the Ozaki 8. A lot of the movie is somewhat preachy regarding honoring Nature. There is a shoot-out later on at a bank because the funds were cut off from these athletes and they need money to continue their ""heists.""<br/><br/>The leader of these extreme athletes is Bodhi played by Edgar Ramirez and he does a credible job. He and his fellow daredevils are decked out in tattoos from head to toe as is Samsara (Teresa Palmer) the love interest for Utah and we can only hope those tats are washable. Yes, Utah also has a lot of tattoos as movies these days seem obsessed with them.<br/><br/>Ray Winstone does a very good job as Pappas, an FBI Agent, who is tasked with keeping an eye on Utah as he works his way into the daredevil group. Delroy Lindo as FBI Instructor Hall I s also very good. <br/><br/>You keep asking about a twist. Well, there is none, but the ending will have to suffice as it goes where you don't expect it to go.

","The 2015 remake of the classic Point break is a shallow reinterpretation of the original film. <br/><br/>The new film is bereft of the ingredients, that made the original film, starring Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves, so watchable. What is most noticeable, is the lack of chemistry between the lead characters, that was so carefully constructed, between the undercover Reeves and the thrill seeking, criminal Swayze. <br/><br/>Just as absent, is the well developed storyline, that, in the original film moved gradually to a worthwhile climax but, in the remake, looses its momentum and fizzles out, in the closing scenes. <br/><br/>The acting is nothing special either. For the most part, it feels like the actors are going through the motions but not really handing in anything that looks like a good let alone outstanding performance. To be fair, this is partly due, to rather bland narrative, infected with pseudo religious rite of passage, nonsense, which centers around taking extreme life threatening risks, to become one with nature.<br/><br/>So if there an upside here? The action sequences and special effects are well handled. There is no shortage of thrills and they are, for the most part, executed in polished fashion. Sadly, that's pretty much all that's on offer here. Watch Point Break for the thrills and spills, by all means just don't expect a lot else here. Five out of ten from me."

","First of all I would like to mention, that I didn't watch the 1991- version and I'll judge this movie without binding to the previous version. After watching trailer I was waiting for a movie with a lot of sport tricks, plenty of dynamic scenes and a posse that robs not for self enrichment, but for supporting impoverished people. In fact I got two first points but not the last one. In the very beginning they really threw thousands of diamonds from skyscraper to Mumbai forks; they threw several million dollars from the airplane to rainforest's Bedouins. They broke the law, but there was some purpose. And it seems to be good. Every crime was connected with one of 8 tricks. So the beginning was very logical: one trick - one ""good"" crime for poor people. Some kind of sportive Robin Goods. But than something went wrong: sometimes they did only tricks and it seems illogical. Sometimes they did tricks with one ""good"" crime, but other people were injured. So it seems either it is such a concept, that they went too far in their philosophy, either the producer had only two ideas how to help people. But the crimes are too different in their nature to be a part of some common action. Nevertheless I loved the power of nature in the film. Huge waves, amazing rocks, rain forests and tricks were exceedingly surreal. So all stars I've given to this movie are for nature, tricks and maybe for some philosophy part, that is understandable for me. But as I think this is not a movie I'll watch again."

He also got the gig as apparently Gerard Butler pulled out due to schedule conflicts, but I'm glad Ramirez got the job. Ray Winstone going through the motions and not really adding anything to the film.<br/><br/>The stunt work in this is incredible to watch with the highlights set in the Alps and the end rock climbing scene in Venezuela. Also, albeit slightly short, is an incredible shootout towards the end of the film, the likes of which I have not seen since the shootout scene in Michael Manns HEAT. On top of all this was the 3D which REALLY did work for this film.

","The original Point Break was an American story. Although there wasn't much background information on the characters in it, you got the sense that the gang knew each other since high school. Meanwhile the cop had been a college football hero.<br/><br/>The new Point Break goes ""Euro."" The characters have accents and the setting is in Europe for the most part. Also, in the original there was a group of guys robbing banks to finance their endless summer and the leader had some vague philosophy about living life on your own terms and showing the world that ""the human spirit is still alive."" But they weren't trying to change the world.<br/><br/>In the new one the guys do crimes that have a huge impact on the world. They also believe that their work is of monumental importance, and they make some effort to help the poor along the way. *But most importantly the difference is that in the old one, they did their crimes for the money itself. In the new one they don't need money, because they have a financier.<br/><br/>I felt that both main characters had engaging looks and personalities. There are a few super awkward moments where Luke Bracey tried to basically imitate Keanu Reeves. I understand that they were paying respect to the original, but that was lame.<br/><br/>In the original there was little or no dialog about the morality of what the gang was doing. That was a big hole in the screenplay. In this one, there is a line or two about potential hypocrisy.<br/><br/>The girl part was so awkward in this new one. All we know is that she had been adopted by some freaky Japanese adventurer. No one even explains her accent. Supposedly she has known the gang leader since childhood, but he is more like a brother than an ex-boyfriend.<br/><br/>In this version, the cop figures out the plot from the very beginning, before even meeting the guys. Then he goes directly to them. In the original there is some confusion and a red herring.<br/><br/>There is no charismatic older partner cop in this one. This guy is just some old European with few lines. The original had an eccentric Vietnam veteran with great lines and a sense of American humor. Also, in the original the commanding officer is an idiot and unsympathetic. In this one there is a black guy who supports our main character from the start. (There were no black characters in the original either) The action scenes are spectacular. That includes the photography and timing. But ultimately the whole thing is just an excuse to show these scenes. I'm not complaining. I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I think the next step should be to make a ""prequel."" You could have one for the original and one for the remake. I need to know how these people became who they are.<br/><br/>Our philosopher leader in this one must be in his late 30's and he's from Venezuela. What the heck has he been doing for the past 20 years and how did he become so good at extreme sports without any fame? Who the hell are his partners and how did he meet them? Why are all of them so skilled at extreme sports? All of the gang characters are much older than the gang in the original Point Break. These guys are grown men pushing 40. That in itself makes the feel of this one quite different.<br/><br/>Check it out. It is worth seeing for the action sequences. Don't expect it to stick to the original plot. Just accept it for what it is and enjoy. Don't listen to the reviewers who hated it, because they are judging it as purists, instead of as action fans."
"FelipeCarrillo","6","0","1","23 January 2016"," ""Feel The Gravity""
","In the summer of 1991 when we saw to reach movie theaters an irrational but refined, surprising and addictive action thriller that challenge gravity, we knew that we would have a 123 minutes runtime project full of beautiful sequences of action but with an argument too empty. How wouldn't it be exciting to see Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze acting against good and evil at the same time? Infiltrate a band with eccentric masks and exposure to thousands of dangers? <br/><br/>Now, then, Why do a remake which did not have any impact? Surely it is because we are in the Decade of remakes to revive old films and turn them into masterpieces of genre (Mad Max: Fury Road) as perhaps all this was not the case. <br/><br/>The new version had the opportunity to change this bitter taste that left the first and in order of quality, obviously achievement it. The film had two choices, let yourself go by the absurdity of the original and pass without rhyme or give us a good project with a delicate picture and keep in a new line of action and adventure. <br/><br/>Ericson Core opted to mix all the above mentioned, reducing that bitter taste that left the delivery number one. A risky man Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey) full of strong tattoos and a powerful look comes (no reason, or if a reason is to be youtuber) the FBI to dismantle a group of apparent thieves that affect the entity. After his operation, meets the man leader Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez) a Monsieur Hood of the topicality. What new is see in a 3D aesthetic a motocross race, a beautiful caused collapse, a spectacular flight and each of the 8 extreme challenges that truly are presented in a majestic way. <br/><br/>Bracey or Reeves? Australian decided give it a touch more staff to Utah and its similarity to Utah is very unreasonable. Ramirez actually feels the character and dazzles us with his team at their extreme tests. Palmer is inconstant and is not permanent in her performance, ending in a way too cliché. <br/><br/>Point Break's powerful emotions believe achieve fill a small argument with intense and dizzying risky scenes, that are aesthetically eye-popping, a white of snow in the mountains or a vehement sequence in Venezuela (seriously, almost vomiting, for the dangerous and influential images) or with the participation of personalities such as 'Teresa Palmer' or 'Steve Aoki' himself. Action events are never lost and they gain the continuity necessary to impact the audience easy. These are points of beginning for future projects within the type. <br/><br/>The game Bracey - Ramirez is late and too reckless. Utah occasionally is congruent but is Bodhi who actually with his dystopian attitude and lack of character manages to establish the relationship. ""Point Break"" enters this time perfectly, with interests and political issues that strike with what will happen soon. in the film they reminded it again and again ""Isn't it beautiful?"", more and more insistent. It is magnificent and is entertaining but directly not precise and briefly makes us imagine that we are back in the thriller in 1991."
"fabiolpinheiro1993","6","0","2","19 January 2016"," An elaborate excuse to show cool extreme sports in great style and a huge waste of potential.
","Well this film had everything (almost everything) to be a great action film. The premise is far from being new, but i could generate a million different plots and stories, some of the most beautiful settings ever seen on screen, super cool thrilling extreme sports, and millions of opportunities to make the most daring thrilling action scenes ever made. But... It just didn't happen. <br/><br/>This film is truly a wonder, why? Because it has one of the most beautiful cinematography and visuals ever, a 105 million budget, and at the some time a b movie feel. <br/><br/>The film has a ton of mesmerizing settings around the world, that provide endless opportunities for thrilling action, and yes the film has great action scenes, but they are overall wasted because the director doesn't seem to know how to dramatize the action. The camera moves and shots never really take advantage of the action, and while i usually hate the lack of big shots in action films, here i hate the lack of close ups, since most of the time you never know who you are watching. The action feels too cold and many times, rushed. <br/><br/>A great example of this is the opening of the film, which is really disappointingly lackluster.Characters die unceremoniously without a touch of drama. It all feels like a bunch of things happening, The best action scene probably is the surf one, really great, but then again it could be so much more. <br/><br/>As i said, the cinematography is stunning, i think i never saw this kind of style. Then the visual effects are really amazing, they look super real. But the editing is quite bad. The continuity is awkward, rushed, feels like there's parts missing. Most of the action scenes for example are too short because its like this thing, that thing, instead of a continuous scene of things. Then the sound mixing is terrible, there's some good effects, like the waves, but everything mixed, the dialogue, the score, the music, the effects, seems weird.<br/><br/>The voices are like voice over, with a strange auto tune effect. It seems like everyone just recorded their dialogue in a studio and then someone just placed that recordings on top of everything. The music choices are weird. But the most disappointing thing, to my surprise, was the score by junkie XL. It is probably the most out of tone, out of place score i have ever seen. Its like he made the score without seeing the film. And the score is not bad on its own, but it is nothing more that a rehash of Hans Zimmer's scores, like inception and man of steel, but without the things that made them what they are, and with a ton o cheese, and the volume upped 1000x all the time.<br/><br/>And the script, which is by far the worst of this film. There's almost no plot, but the one there is could be great, but i wasn't. It's just something cool to show cool extreme sports. The dialogue is not a total disaster, but like its script is right there on the verge and you wonder how someone can write this and think its good. And there's some very weird moments. The end is also so strange!<br/><br/>The cast is what it is, and they do the best they can with what they have, and the two leads are fine, but the film could have benefited from some bigger talent. <br/><br/>The film has great style, which is the best it has to offer, with some good action scenes, but they never live up to their potential. There's almost zero drama or thrills, because this is nothing more than an elaborate excuse to show extreme sports. The frustrating part is that behind the elaborate excuse stands a huge potential for a great, thrill ride, filled with high octane drama. A good writer and director would have done wonders with all this ingredients. Truly a waste of potential."
"paul-allaer","6","0","2","13 January 2016"," Unnecessary remake but enjoyable extreme sports action scenes
","""Point Break"" (2015 release from US/China; 113 min.) opens with a crazy sequence, where we see a couple of bike riders attempt an outrageous stunt, only for it to end in tragedy. We are then told ""Seven Years Later"", and our hero is now in the FBI Academy. Before we know it, he is off to infiltrate a group that is, well, I'm not going to tell you. At this point, we're 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: first, while there is of course a plot that guides the movie (and the plot is only in spirit connected to the original Point Break), I have to say that the plot doesn't matter in the least. Why? Because let's face it, we are here to see what crazy stunts the film makers can pull off, while making us believe that they are real. And do they? Yes, they certainly do, although I can't tell to what extent the stunts are real or fake. For example, the free solo rock climb at Angel Falls in Venezuela: if that was real, that was pure insanity, period. Second, this movie is mostly by a no-name crew. The only names that jumps out to me include Kurt Wimmer, who wrote the script (and previously wrote the script for Salt and the remake of Total Recall), and Junkie XL, who composed the movie's score. Third, this is a US-Chinese co-production, as in: the Chinese (through DMG China) put up a lot of the money for this movie. When you watch the film, it was clear this was an expensive production (filming in India, Italy, Austria, Venezuela, Tahiti, Hawaii, Utah, and other places), so curiosity got the better of me and I looked up what this movie cost. I almost fell out of my chair when I read that the production budget was over $100 million (and that's not counting the marketing budget). Did anyone even ask for this remake? <br/><br/>I was on the fence about seeing this,but curiosity for the action scenes got the better of me so I went to see it during the New Year's holidays. The early evening screening where I saw this at in Fort Myers was attended okay but not great. If you are a sucker/addict for extreme sports, you may want to check this out. If not, there honestly is no reason whatsoever to see this movie."
"burlesonjesse5","6","0","1","6 January 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Point Break
","I don't consider Keanu Reeves to be the world's greatest actor. But in all honesty, he gives one of the best performances of his career (next to Speed) in 1991's favorable hit, Point Break. 24 years later, ""Break"" is being remade with Aussie Luke Bracey in the Reeves role. Sad to say though, Bracey doesn't equal Keanu's charisma or wide-eyed intensity. And the same goes for 2015's reworking in general. But hey, I've seen a lot worse of these second-runs to come down the pike. Case in point: Did anyone remember the modernized version of Poltergeist from last summer? Me neither.<br/><br/>Not coming off as shot-for-shot, not changing any of the persona's names, not using the same locales (the original was set in surrounding L.A. while 2015's version goes all over the globe), and directed by cinematographer Ericson Core, new crop Point Break focuses on extreme motocross star-turned-FBI-agent, Johnny Utah (played by Luke Bracey who appears to be channeling the lead singer of the grunge band Puddle Of Mudd). You see Utah feels responsible for the death of his best friend (years ago, buddy Jeff perished from a cliff via a motorbike mishap). He needs ""structure"" in his life so he vehemently decides to join the Bureau. His first assignment: Go undercover, accumulate enough evidence, and capture Bodhi (played by Edgar Ramirez) plus his merry band of badasses. In the original ""Break"", Bodhi and his crew wanted to quote unquote, ""rob banks to finance their endless summer, whoa!"" Cut to present day and surfer/snowboarder/fight club member Bodhisattva wants to conquer the Ono Osaki 8, a series of ordeals that honors the forces of nature. This somehow involves committing a lot of felonious activities (who knew). Now with the newfangled version, helmer Core provides cinematography that harbors a real silvery look. And if you're afraid of heights, it's best to look away during many a scene (I talked about these same aspects in my previous review of The Walk).<br/><br/>Anyway, as mentioned in the first paragraph, I stated that there are far worse remakes than the new Point Break. The two films are surprisingly dissimilar making this current reboot pretty much its own vehicle. In fact, if the original never existed, I would probably garner Point Break circa 2015 a higher rating. So OK, does that mean I'm gonna recommend it? Not quite. The original from 91' is epic. It's stronger in that it gives you the urge to view it multiple times (a cult classic is what I'm saying here). There are quotable lines of dialogue (""back off Warchild, seriously""), visceral gunfights staged by director Kathryn Bigelow, fleshed out characters, doses of mild humor, nuggets of snarky dialogue, original concepts, strong acting from the leads (Reeves and the late Patrick Swayze), and one bitch of a parachute-free, skydiving sequence. 2015's ""Break"" doesn't exactly contain these traits. Yeah, it's filmed well with a more straightforward narrative and scenery that if you pause it, looks like postcards. Plus, the action sequences are decent in that they're carried out with veritable aplomb. But Point Break redux (that's what I've decided to call it) sledgehammers lousily, a certain something. We as an audience, don't want to be diverted from important plot points to see extreme sports for the sake of extreme sports. This isn't X Games mind you, it's a movie. Bottom line: I give modern-day Point Break a strong two and a half star rating. I paid six dollars and attended a matinée screening to view it. Not a classic but I have zero regrets.<br/><br/>Of note: As I took in the slickly, up-to-date (Christmas Day) release that is Point Break, one of its characters constantly annoyed the bejesus out of me. That would be Angelo Pappas. In 1991's original, he was Johnny Utah's agent partner, a kooky, cigar-chomping blowhard with a devil-may-care attitude and an appetite for sloppy, meatball sandwiches. Gary Busey played him as though he was playing his own, eccentric self. Cut to 2015 and we have Ray Winstone as Pappas. Again he's an agent. He's scruffy, grumpy, and lights up the ol' tobacco. This time though, Angelo does almost nothing. Yeah he makes a phone call or two and judges Utah from afar. But in the grand scheme of things, he doesn't even get in on the action like Busey's Pappas gleefully did (he never manages to pull out his weapon). Next time don't sleepwalk through it all Ray. Also of note: I know I talked about Luke Bracey (earlier) not being right for the role of sunny bro Johnny Utah. He can act though. All you gotta do is check him out in 2014's The November Man. The dude shines co-starring alongside Pierce Brosnan. This is merely just food for thought."
"gonzofaratro","6","0","1","3 January 2016"," READ WELL - ""Inspired by"" and NOT a remake of the original
","If you are one of those expecting this film to be a remake and want to compare both films, don't waste your time, this one is inspired by the original and departs from it in many way, so if you are a fan of point break, surely this won't be for you, stay away.<br/><br/>Change the title from Point Break to a pleasing action flick title and you get a good action film, just that, entertaining and quite nice visually as the extreme spot parts are really good. The stunts are nice and well executed by professionals <br/><br/>Enjoy the film for what it is and DON'T compare it to the original.<br/><br/>Cinematography is quite good too, combined with a nice soundtrack and remember, it bares no resemblance to the original film"
"The-Sarkologist","4","0","3","1 January 2016"," Should have given it a different name
","Back in the early nineties there was this movie released starring Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves where the FBI were attempting to track down a gang of bank robbers known as the Ex-Presidents gang, and one of the agents suspected that they were a group of surfers. That movie was really cool, however for some bizarre reason they decided to remake the movie and this film was the result. I actually didn't think that this film was a bad film, but the main reason that I gave it such a low rating is because instead of creating a stand-alone film with fresh characters, they decided to simply turn it into a remake. This, in my honest opinion, is little more than lazy script writing.<br/><br/>What we have in this film are a group of extreme sportsmen who are 'chasing the eight', eight tasks which are considered to be the pinnacle of extreme sports and are supposed to make you one with nature. The trailer suggests that they are committing these robberies so as to fund their adventures, but it becomes pretty clear than they are only doing them as a part of the thrill. In a way this gang are a group of eco-terrorists, and the robberies are more of a Robin Hood escapade than anything else.<br/><br/>The visual effects are spectacular, and the idea of a group of eco-terrorists seeking out these eight challenges does make a good basis for a film, however as I have mentioned, to actually put this into a remake of a much earlier film demonstrates that whoever put this film together couldn't be bothered creating original characters, or even original names. Mind you, it has been a while since I watched the original Point Break, but it has been suggested that some films should just be left alone. The original movie simply dealt with a bunch of adrenaline junkies, but there was much more to the characters than there appeared to be in this film. For instance the original Johnny Utah actually had a significant flaw that would hinder his ability to be able to get his man. It seemed, in this film, that they just used the clichéd element of watching his friend die, which didn't seem to add all that much to it – and in any case, how could a guy with such a psychological drag make it as far as he did in the FBI training.<br/><br/>So, if you like extreme sports, and some spectacular scenery, then it isn't a bad movie, however try to put out of your mind the movie upon what this is based (which I have to say is hard to do at time, especially since it carries the same title)."
"brandonharrell","4","0","2","30 December 2015"," Visually dazzling but lacking in plot
","The picture in this movie is amazing! You get to see beautiful mountains, hardcore dirt biking, and fantastic surfing, but as much as I love the picture there was a poor plot and it was executed pretty terribly. You never really understand why the protagonist does the things he does and I think they could have made several scenes more dramatic. In this movie the antagonist are all about protecting nature by completing this set of insane feats, but they never publicize anything so I don't see how they are helping preserve nature at all. The cool daredevil scenes were enough to get me through the movie, but if you want to see a movie with a little more depth this is not the movie for you."
