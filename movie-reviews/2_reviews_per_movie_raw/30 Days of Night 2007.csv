"DaRetroChick","8","26","31","30 December 2011"," Very good movie, quiet scary.
","Okay, this is a scary film actually worth watching.<br/><br/>I've seen quiet a lot of vampire/zombie movies, and this one stands out to me, because even though it sometimes uses a bit of gore, that's not what makes it scary.<br/><br/>It's the tension. You just don't know what is going to happen next, the atmosphere is very creepy and the movie just gets through to you, like you can almost feel the Alaskan cold. Most scary movies I see end really badly, this one sort of did as well, but with a bit of romance.<br/><br/>The thing that scared me the most about it is the vampires, I mean, you wont want one of them coming into your room at night.<br/><br/>Overall, very good and worth watching..<br/><br/>8/10"
"WriterDave","8","267","407","23 October 2007"," Best Vampire Movie in Over a Decade
","As night begins to fall for a thirty day spell over a small Alaskan outpost village, a motley crew of vampires comes waltzing in for a feast in David Slade's adaptation of the graphic novel, ""30 Days of Night."" Ever since ""Interview with the Vampire"" vampires have been depicted in films as something hip, cool, and sexy. Recently the idea of becoming a vampire is like making a fashion statement or becoming a Scientologist. In ""30 Days of Night"" the vampires are nameless, cunning, animal-like bloodsuckers and far from mindless zombies (which have been more popular of late). Finally, vampires are restored to film as monsters to be feared and not as some sympathetic and alluring subculture.<br/><br/>The film grabs you from its opening shot of a man walking through a desolate snow covered landscape away from an ominous boat docked in the ice and never lets go. Director Slade wisely avoids many of the seizure-inducing trappings of recent horror films. Sure, there are the prerequisite quick-cuts in the intimate scenes of carnage, but there are also haunting wide-angled shots and one expertly staged bird's-eye-view crane shot when the vampires first begin dragging people out of their houses into the street. While successfully adapting some of the great imagery from the graphic novel, Slade is fully aware that this is still a film and shies away from CGI and overly-stylized lighting and effects that would detract from the sense of realism necessary in a far-fetched horror film such as this.<br/><br/>Slade also makes good use of his cast. Danny Huston is perfectly creepy as the vampires' leader. Josh Hartnett, who is typically miscast and emotionless, actually fits well the role of a wooden Sheriff of a remote Alaskan town. Ben Foster, who always overacts, is used effectively here in a bit role as an over-the-top Reinfield-like character who ushers the vampires' arrival in town. Melissa George is pretty and sympathetic as Hartnett's estranged wife. Like many serious horror films of recent memory (""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""The Descent"") the film attempts some character development that is often ""emo"" but never overplays its hand.<br/><br/>Aside from being better directed and better acted than your run-of-the-mill horror flick, ""30 Days of Night"" is also fantastically gory. Decaptation aficionados will especially rejoice. Refreshing, too, is the way it takes its gore and action dead seriously. There are no silly one-liners or graphic sight gags. The characters are deeply affected by what they witness and what they have to do to survive. This is pure horror, and it's relentless.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some missteps with the film's pacing and some huge leaps of logic in the amount of time that passes between events. However, for the shear originality of its central conceit, the intensity of the gore, and the haunting quality of many of its signature shots, David Slade's ""30 Days of Night"" is the most exhilarating horror film since Danny Boyle's original ""28 Days Later"" and the best vampire film since Francis Ford Coppola delivered ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" back in 1992."
"TJ1380","9","190","289","27 October 2007"," One of the most effective horror movies I've seen in a long time
","""30 Days of Night"" is easily one of the best horror movies I've seen in a very long time mostly because everyone involved seemed to know exactly what it takes to make a decent horror movie. It's not obscene amounts of gore or monsters jumping out at the camera that make a movie scary. It's creepy atmosphere that makes a movie particularly scary, and this movie does a great job at creating the kind of atmosphere that fills the viewer with the kind of dread that so many movies fail to achieve. It's not perfect, but it's still better than just about every horror movie I've seen since ""The Descent"" (which also relied on a creepy atmosphere to fill the viewer with a sense of dread and hopelessness).<br/><br/>This movie is set in the small town of Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost town in the U.S. Because it is so far up north, there comes a time every winter where the sun doesn't rise for 30 days. The fact that this translates into a month without sunlight attracts a group of vampires who attack the town and spend the month feeding on its citizens. Eventually only a handful of humans remain in town, and they must survive the month without starving, freezing, or being killed by the vampires. It's a fairly simple concept, yet the director makes it work incredibly well. There is a sense of dread and hopelessness that permeates this entire film. Barrow is a town that appears to be cut off from the rest of the world. It seems to be surrounded by a sea of white on all sides, and the citizens seem to be stuck in a state of depression. Barrow seems to be the worst place in the world to be, and that's before the sun sets and the vampires show up. When the vampires do make themselves known, that sense of isolation and hopelessness turns into a feeling of dread that doesn't go away. One really gets the sense that there is no escape for the small group of survivors. This feeling is made all the more real by the long periods between the vampire attacks. Normally I consider long periods where not much happens a bad thing, but here it works in the film's favor. We may not always see the vampires, but their presence is always felt. At any given time in the movie one can see blood splattered onto snow and hear the distant screams and occasional gunfire of yet another one of Barrow's citizens getting killed, and it's easy to get the feeling that any of the main characters could be the next to die. The vampires themselves are also unlike any we've seen in movies for some time. They aren't the kind of seductive and charming vampires that seem to show up in every other horror movie. These vampires are feral, ruthless, and sadistic, with sharp crocodile-like teeth and bloodstained clothes. There's nothing romantic about them or their actions; they just want to kill people and drink their blood. It helps that they get far less screen time than the human characters; normally we only see them as shadows in the background stalking their prey. When they do attack, it's incredibly vicious and horrifyingly violent (the first large-scale attack on the town is a particular highlight of this film). This viciousness adds to the hopelessness and vulnerability of the humans while making the vampires seem like some of the scariest movie monsters to come along in a while.<br/><br/>If I can find any fault in this movie, it's that the ending seems a bit contrived and cliché. It doesn't take too much away from the movie though; to complain about it is really nitpicking more than anything. Overall it's one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time, and easily the best vampire movie to come along in years. I would definitely recommend it, especially since it's a good alternative to the endless ""torture porn"" we've been seeing from this genre for the last few years."
"Bigs944","7","292","455","13 October 2007"," Very good film for its genre.
","I had the opportunity to see this film tonight at a free screening at a theater in Chelsea, NY with the director David Spade, Melissa George and Josh Hartnett all present at the screening and I walked in expecting another run of the mill vampire movie and walked away pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>It's no question that over the last 9 years the whole Vampire trend has been overdone to death. Blade spawned a sudden interest in a subject that has been around forever but hadn't been refreshed in quite some time. After Blade, enter Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series and so on and so forth until the whole vampire trend had well worn its welcome. A few years pass and here's yet another vampire story. What makes this story any different? The graphic novel, 30 Days of Night, put together by the talented team that worked on Todd McFarlane's stunning ""Hellspawn"" series, Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith found a way to do something creative within the vampire realm, and its completely to do with premise.<br/><br/>That premise being, vampires being allowed to run amok freely in Alaska during a 30 day period when there is no sun to force them into hibernation during the day. Its simple yet fresh enough to maintain my interest, it's a wonder no one had thought to write this story until now.<br/><br/>What's important to note is that the story does not go into too much detail about the leading characters personal lives, nor does it go into too much detail about the vampires themselves. We don't know how they came to be and what their philosophy is (besides sucking blood) and that's a good thing, Its plunged strait into action and this lack of over characterization, actually helps to strengthen this story.<br/><br/>Despite the Alaska angle the film and the story itself is nothing really original. Even the vampires themselves are nothing we haven't seen before. Black trench coats and a mouthful of fangs, speaking in a foreign tongue with an evil squeal. But it's okay. I've seen it before but that doesn't mean that it's not going to make the movie any less entertaining.<br/><br/>Where this movie is successful is in the fact that it's handled in a very realistic way. Nothing is too over the top, Evan; Josh Hartnett's character is a believable and very human sheriff. He doesn't do anything in this movie that doesn't seem plausible, in fact the film has very little cringe moments and hardy any cheesy dialogue.<br/><br/>But it doesn't take itself too seriously either. It is what it is; an extremely gory movie about vampires killing people and it's thrilling, entertaining and put together very well. Its so basic that it works, not since the Decent had I seen a horror movie that succeeded in this matter by keeping the story basic and believable and not relying on cheap tricks to try and thrill the audience. Of course there's the sudden jump moments, but you don't see Even leaping over dumpsters shooting off semi-automatic weapons and spurting out one liners.<br/><br/>When it comes to the films performances, the supporting actors do a good job and the ever dopey and extremely untalented Josh Hartnett whom I never fail to dislike, in everything he does, somehow seemed almost likable in this movie and I don't know why, but I did like him in this roll.<br/><br/>Some of the shots in this movie are incredible; I can honestly say I've never seen anything like a few scenes that popped up in this movie. There's an overhead shot that spans the entire town amidst all of the chaos of the vampire attack and I can honestly say it is breathtaking.<br/><br/>Overall it's a very strong film for its genre, dare I say one of the best. You simply can't compare it to Citizen Cane, or the Godfather but for what it is, its very good. If you like graphic novels, liked the Decent, like horror or sci-fi. Or Vampires. You'll be pleased. Well worth it for free and if I had played would be satisfied."
"myrkeyjones","9","183","290","14 November 2007"," Dark, moody, stylish..IGNORE the haters
","I didn't think i could get exited by watching a vampire movie ever again. All the greats have made fine use of the mythology, Francis Ford Coppola, Neil Jordan, Steven Norrington, Guillermo Del Toro and lets not forget one of the greatest F. W. Murnau. <br/><br/>30 Day of Night, is a delightfully nasty horror, which has once again has wet my appetite to see those whom are fanged back on celluloid. These vampire's are just scary, no sexual innuendo, they are just plain beasts.<br/><br/>The films Comic book origins are quite evident through the film, one of its main draw cards is that it looks beautiful, the cinematography is fabulous, the punchy electro rock score used is effectively scarce during the film, silence is the films most potent suspense weapon.<br/><br/>The Cast is great, Josh Hartnet Putting probably the best performance of his career, but it's Ben Foster who really steals the show, I've never seen a actor possessed by their own character to that extent since Anthony Hopkins and Lector. Mellisa George is perfectly fine, i wasn't blown away, but Danny Huston was superbly Menacing, his presence in the film was foreboding.<br/><br/>Now to the films few flaws, the amazing build up, that incorporated the mystery of what exactly was going on in the town was swiftly ripped away by full on carnage, this was a little distracting, but soon the suspense returned.<br/><br/>I have to recommend this film, i don't really understand why people arn't liking the film. It's very old fashioned in its approach, most probably why it is so brilliant. give it a go.<br/><br/>Recommendation: If you call yourself a horror fan, you really shouldn't dislike it"

","I really do not understand what these critics are based to rate a movie, this excellent movie has a horrible rating when others are not so good they have excellent rating, 30 days of night is a clear example that we can not judge a movie based on Critics"
"czarnobog","10","307","513","19 October 2007"," A Breath of Fresh Bloody Air for the Vampire Legend!!
","""30 Days of Night"" is a very welcome addition to the ranks of vampire movies. This one is strictly for horror fans, not for doily-draped gender-confused romantics dreaming of third degree hickies from pretty fanged lovers in New Orleans.<br/><br/>The fun begins in the first frame, courtesy of the evocative setting, a snowbound town at the Northern edge of America. The only iffy moment comes with the introduction of Josh Hartnett as the town sheriff. Young and movie star handsome, he threatens to come off as unbelievable, like the Ben Affleck sheriff in ""Phantoms."" Hartnett, however, despite his young years, has the gravitas to pull off this role, and director David Slade gets masterful performances from all the fine actors in this film.<br/><br/>Melissa George is scrumptiously beautiful. (Her mouth is so cute it should be patented.) She's also an excellent actress, who horror fans should remember from the recent (and highly recommended) remake of The Amityville Horror. With her endearing little girl face and keen talent for playing it straight under the most fantastic of circumstances, she's likable, sympathetic and totally believable in this role.<br/><br/>What really sets this film apart though is its portrayal of the vampires. Someone obviously boned up on ancient vampire legends, because these are the most authentic movie vampires since Boris Karloff's ""wurdalak"" in Mario Bava's ""Black Sabbath"" 40 years ago.<br/><br/>Speaking in a strange Eastern European tongue (Romanian? or Hungarian?) these creatures bear the remains of human personalities, but are purely evil; cunning and vicious and blood-stained, like vampires were before Bram Stoker introduced the ""new improved"" (i.e. sanitized) Victorian model and Anne Rice gussied it up even more.<br/><br/>Fans of Kathryn Bigelow's ""Near Dark"" and John Carpenter's ""Vampires"" will appreciate the high action and body count. The story is a bit slimmer than either of those two films (it is based on a comic book, after all) but it's very atmospheric and suspenseful, with superb production values all around.<br/><br/>The visual efx are topnotch, especially when they're subtle, such as snowflakes adding their magical luster to a scene. The special make-up efx (blood and guts et al) are completely believable, but aside from a few very graphic images and much spilled blood in the snow, are not as overwhelming as some overly squeamish reviewers have claimed.<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous, and is enhanced by the seamlessly integrated visual effects noted above.<br/><br/>If you're in the mood for a nicely paced, well-produced, superbly directed movie that'll satisfy your craving for a dose of traditional horror, you can't go wrong with this one."
"otakucore","10","23","32","31 December 2011"," Best horror movie in years
","I don't know how this slipped under the radar. The main character is shown to be making hard choices before the first vampire even appears and every scene, practically, is a moral dilemma with great play on viewer expectation. The performances, writing, editing and shot selection all are excellent. Josh Hartnett and, to my surprise, Ben Foster (who knew he was a great actor even before Rampart) were incredible.<br/><br/>I hate to say this because it pisses me off to no end when I hear it from fans of The Matrix Reloaded and The Fountain, but the haters seem to be thick. Every negative review I read demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the vampire myth (particularly a confusion between the semantic and syntactic aspects of genre).<br/><br/>The writers of this film understand vampires. The vampire is pure narcissism incarnate, utterly lacking in empathy, sympathy, and mercy; and the film expresses that through action and dialogue to an extraordinary degree. Vampires lack what makes us fundamentally human, and the horror genre itself is about the delineation between human and monster. Where this movie really shines is in how it shows that we have to make hard choices and become monsters ourselves to fight evil. I rank it right up there with Dracula."
"MovieWiz66","8","102","167","14 November 2007"," Very unique take on an old legend
","I am typically not a great fan of vampire films. However,this movie is a new take on an old legend. The setting is fantastic and what could be more scary than 30 days of endless night when you are besieged by vampires. These are not your fathers vampires,nothing seductive or even campy about these guys. They are what the vampire was originally supposed to have been..SCARY! I think of all setting..an arctic or Alaskan frozen,isolated area is a great stage for horror and suspense. Movies like Howard Hawks ""The Thing from Another World"" and its 1982 sequel ""The Thing"" use the same setting with admirable results. Even the underrated Stephen King mini-series ""Storm of the Century"" uses the same cold,barren and isolated setting to create tension,despair and hopelessness. The acting is average,if not slightly above,and the mood and lighting are very good. All in all a movie that made you crave a little more when it ended..and that is what all movies strive for. Although it could have had a few improvements and should have provided a little more background for the story(things sort of just go to hell all at once),it is most definitely a film worth a couple hours of your time."
"siderite","9","31","47","19 December 2010"," This is a good vampire horror! Yes, we can!
","The movie is not a complete masterpiece, but it is damn close. It features cool vampires attacking an isolated town, people fighting for their lives, scenes with actual emotional impact and lots of blood. Oh, and Melissa George!<br/><br/>Somehow I have missed this movie when it appeared so I watched it back to back with the sequel that appeared in 2010. Man, were they completely different! If this film made me immediately jump to the computer and start the sequel to see how it continues, the other made me watch it in fast-forward.<br/><br/>The film gets a little of that Swedish movie Låt den rätte komma: the vampires are human-like, but not human; they are strong and fast and deadly; they do not glitter, wear fashionable clothing or have other interests than drinking your blood. In a sense it is similar to Near Dark as well.<br/><br/>Bottom line: There are holes in the plot and it doesn't really try to create a vampire mythos at all. But that is a good thing, as it adds to the gritty, visceral feel of the movie. It is the proof that vampire movies can be good! Therefore my recommendation is that you should not miss this film, but definitely avoid the Uwe-Boll-like sequel from 2010."
"patrauceanu_cristy","10","33","53","29 December 2007"," A very good end !
","The movie was a masterpiece.Nothing ridiculous as i see on many horror movies,the main character Josh Hartnett played very good and during the movie time I was captured all the time, I don't blink a second.The vampires were made very good,they really looked scary!!The scenery man must to be a genius,I really appreciate the work that he did on this movie.Very good thinking !! Well done !! It is refreshing to see a vampire film that doesn't shy away from violence and that doesn't dwell on anything that can be even remotely construed as hokey. A new cinematic creature, 30 Days of Night's antagonists are ultra scary with their deformed appearances and their mercilessly gut-wrenching killing sprees. They speak in their own demonic language and have super human strength and speed, making them a Michael Myers fashioned juggernaut. High-pitched shrieks, blood-soaked visages and razor-sharp fingernails complete a frightening design of this force to be reckoned with.What impressed me very much, was the ending of the movie that was pure and simple stunning !! I really recommend this movie for the people who loves horror movies."
"Impartial-Critic","Null","24","38","10 May 2020"," A Brainless Fast-paced Bloodbath.
","Nothing else to see here folks! A gang of Vampires attack an excluded Alaskan town during a full month with no sunlight.<br/><br/>The idea is interesting but the production is awfully bad. The only decent thing in this movie was the vampire makeup and their facial design which looked interesting, some kind of a hybrid between the typical demonic faces and a classic vampire face. On the other hand, the story is very limited, very fast-paced to the level that you can barely relate to any character, the cinematography although having very few decent fixed scenes, the director screws up movie with applying the shaky camera technique in most of the movie...beside the obvious reason in which to cover over the major goofs, he was trying to imply the randomness and the speed of the attack but, No...It was poorly executed as it can make the audience confused and less focused on the major events. The editing was another fall for this, as some scenes feels they are missing parts to give an appropriate explanation, all in which led to an over all average experience unless you are into a brainless vampire flick."
"jiggler900","9","16","24","22 September 2008"," A great Night-time movie
","i am 13 years old and i love horror movies,and this movie blows vampires out of the way,into a new generation. Everyone knows most of the actors in this movie, and this movie probably could keep you watching the whole 30 days. Shocking deaths and surprising ending. A true vampire flick from start to finish. Some of the most powerful scenes were the survival, the suspense was great and the actors where pretty realistic (i would've just ran away if i could). I could say so many more things about this movie and it's amazing style. (The plot was well planned out). The one question that will keep us going is where did they come from?"

","This movie is by far my new favorite horror movie for so many reasons. It has a lot of action, gore and suspense in it with some scary scenes that either made you jump or momentarily cover your eyes. The setting is really ingenious and is quite frightening if you were to place yourself in the shoes of the people in the town. Another great thing I loved about this movie was that it gave a new face to vampires. They are not undead creatures in capes that fly around romanticizing humans. They are blood thirsty creatures who look and act like animals. I definitely recommend this movie to all horror fans and even more so to vampire fans. This is one movie that I hope they make a sequel for."
"Streebo","9","63","114","21 October 2007"," 30 Days of Night gives savage new blood to vampire genre!
","First, here's a bit of backstory for you. As you know by now, Streebo is a long time reader of comic books and when the story of 30 Days of Night came out in 2003 (?) I was eager to read it. I was immediately impressed by the simplicity of the concept  if not the execution. Ben Templesmith's dark and atmospheric art helped keep the book horrific and violent throughout. The story by Steve Niles was unchallenging, simple and brilliant all at the same time. I remember reading the book and thinking this was a cool enough graphic novel  but it would make an amazing movie. Apparently Steve Niles originally wrote 30 Days of Night as a screenplay and shopped it around Hollywood for years. He never drew interest in the script  so he converted the script into a graphic novel. The comic comes out and is a huge hit. The next thing you know Hollywood comes knocking on Steve Niles' door. Niles dusted off his script and Sam Raimi's Ghosthouse pictures gave him a one million dollar check for it. Now fast forward four years later. . .<br/><br/>30 Days of Night tells the story of the northernmost Alaskan town of Barrow as it prepares to face the seasonal event of 30 sunless days and nights. Over two thirds of the town's population packs up and leaves for the month as most people cannot handle the experience of living through 30 days without seeing the sun. Little do they know there is something much worse than simple darkness descending upon their town. 30 Days of night follows the story of town sheriff Eben as he struggles with a small band of locals that try to survive their 30 days trapped in a town overrun by vampires.<br/><br/>Strange events begin early as Eben discovers that almost ever cell phone in the town has been stolen and burned to a crisp. Next, every sled dog in the town is slaughtered. Then the phone lines go out and lastly the power to the town is cut. It's holy sh)*t time. There are no namby-pamby-love-me-long-time-I'm-immortal vampires in this film. These vampires are feral, nasty, and very hungry. The performances from the cast are strong all around. The vampires are kept in the dark for the most part  making them extremely frightening when they burst forth to drag people though the streets and rend them limb from limb.<br/><br/>The cinematography is appropriately atmospheric and captures the bleak landscape in cold unforgiving detail. There is one moment depicting a bird's eye view of the town streets as the vampires toss townspeople about like bloody beads at Mardi Gras. The scene is truly horrific and breathtaking in it's savagery. The tension starts with a bang as the vampires swarm through the streets and never lets up as the survivors try to come to terms with what is happening. 30 Days of Night is a horror film in every sense of the term. It is cold, humorless and completely unrelenting. As I watched in stunned silence with the crowd  I couldn't help but recall the nihilistic tone of John Carpenter's The Thing. That's high praise indeed coming from me and one I don't give lightly.<br/><br/>I don't want to talk the film up too much resulting in a letdown of expectations for some of you. If you're in the need for your theatrical horror film fix  don't wait for Saw 4  30 Days of Night is waiting to rip your throat out. Go see it.<br/><br/>Streebo gives 30 Days of Night a 9 out of 10 on the Streebo Scream-O-Meter."
"Dillypogo","9","15","23","15 September 2008"," 30 Days Of Night: Genuinely Creepy
","Vampires, gore and Josh Hartnett. What more could you want? Well, that's what you get in 30 Days of Night. Hartnett stars as Eben, a sheriff living in the town of Barrow, which is annually plunged into complete darkness for 30 days. This is the perfect place for a gang of vampires led by Marlow (Danny Huston) to feed on its inhabitants for the month. Eben and his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) are forced to fight for their lives along with a group of survivors until sunlight appears again.<br/><br/>Modern horror movies are usually just looking to make you jump but 30 Days of Night is genuinely creepy and scary. It manages to tap into the audience's element of fear and also makes them think of what they would do if in the character's situation, which is most common with zombie films. The scariness of the movie is because of the terrifying, not-your-typical vampires. These aren't the charming, handsome vampires we've seen a thousand times before but are merciless creatures that would tear you apart in a matter of seconds, strangely making them more believable.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night is most definitely not for the weak-of-stomach. Once the vampires appear and start to feed, the gore kicks off with a big bang. The over-the-top amount of blood is necessary but it's shocking at some points, even for a vampire film. The most shockingly violent scene has got to be when a girl vampire gets axed in the neck twice.<br/><br/>All of the cast give excellent performances, especially Hartnett and Huston. I really didn't think that Huston would be able to pull off a menacing vampire leader but after seeing him play the character I realise that he was perfectly cast. I do have one problem with Josh Hartnett and that is he doesn't really convince as a sheriff due to his young age.<br/><br/>Brian Reitzell's music is the perfect score for 30 Days of Night. Consisting of mainly hollow noises, it sounds extraordinarily creepy. Also, the melody in the last scene is great.<br/><br/>My favourite part of the film is the breath-taking aerial shot of the chaos brought by the vampires. Amazingly choreographed, it shows people running, shooting and being killed by the merciless monsters. It's really effective in that it makes you realise how fast they can take over the town.<br/><br/>There's one scene near the end that I felt was very disappointing. I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen the movie, but it's the Danny Huston battle sequence. It was pretty pathetic after the rest of the film and I think it could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>Despite that scene, 30 Days of Night is bloody brilliant. I give it 9/10."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","5","35","62","20 October 2007"," Maybe my expectations were just a little too high
","30 Days of Night was one of the horror films I was looking forward to most this year. I mean from the moment I saw the trailer early spring, I was looking up on IMDb when the release date was, it was agony knowing that I had to wait until October. Finally, last night, opening night, it was storming in my city, so it was like the most perfect time to go see this movie. So my friend and I saw this last night and the theater was packed, when the movie ended, there was only one person who started to clap, but then stopped immediately when he saw that there was no one else clapping. While my friend liked this movie, I wasn't too thrilled. It didn't seem like a real vampire film, more like Night of the Living Dead or 28 Days Later, where this group is just hiding from the vampires. Not to mention that things were just not well explained, but maybe I need to read the book to get it, because this movie failed to explain certain situations.<br/><br/>Eben is the sheriff of the northern most town in the U.S., also it is night for 30 days, the roads shut down and some of the population leaves and some stays. Things go extremely bad though when a gang of vampires decides that this is the perfect town to move to. They pretty much get most of the townspeople, except for Eben, his ex-wife, Stella, his little brother, Jake, and a couple more of their friends. Since the vamps have cut the power and had someone burn all the cell phones, it's impossible for the gang to escape, but they are going to try to make it for the month. But that's going to be tough when the vamps spoiled their dinner the first day and now need more happy meals on foot.<br/><br/>The plot was incredibly good and original, I was so thrilled that this seemed to be like a real vampire movie. But unfortunately there were things that were just not well explained. Now like how the vampires seemed to want to be known in this world, but then later on they try to ""hide"" what they did by burning the town, it didn't make much sense. Then how did The Stranger fit into this whole mess? Was he a potential vampire? Was he promised to live if he did these things for the vamps or promised to be turned into a vampire? Then also why did Josh Hartnett become a vampire? I know it was to gain super strength, but still, it seemed kinda silly for him to jump so quickly. Not to mention the love story between him and Stella didn't have good enough chemistry to pay attention too. I feel bad bashing this film because I so badly wanted to like it, but it just didn't pull through for me.<br/><br/>5/10"
"DJRumpy","9","25","43","20 October 2007"," Probably one of the best axe head choppings I've ever seen ;)
","What can I say. I loved this flick. It was a nice ride. The movie starts off with a good teaser, and escalates into action within about 15 minutes after a brief character introduction to the main players. After the initial shock of violence, the move escalates into a tense cat and mouse (literally). I found myself squirming in my seat more than once with a tight grip on my arm rests.<br/><br/>The plot is a unique idea for vampire flicks, which seems pretty rare these days. Vampires decide to visit a town in far north Alaska that gets 30 days of night in the dead of winter.<br/><br/>Buffet anyone? Josh Hartnett and Melissa George play well together, and the supporting actors do a good job of getting you emotionally involved. They did a great job of making you feel the hopelessness of the situation.<br/><br/>If your a vampire fan, this is a MUST see. If your just a horror fan, or even a gore fan, that is also a must see.<br/><br/>Great tension, great plot, great acting. Fun for the whole family (as long as they are old enough to vote anyway)"

","David Slade did an exceptional work once again and is fast becoming a director from whom we can expect great things in the future.The film has an astounding look due to its excellently worked cinematography.The art direction is also top class while the way the vampires are portrayed adds extra points to it.The movie manages to pass through the feeling of isolation and dread that the characters are supposed to feel and i especially enjoyed the fact that a melancholic touch is present throughout it's duration.The action is intense and the gore strikes true.Additionally,if you are into Josh Hartnett as an actor there is no way you'll be disappointed as he does a high standard job in this film.Finally,it has to be said that for fans of Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and ""Vampires"",""30 Days of Night"" is a must see."
"billion_mucks","6","49","93","21 November 2007"," A Boosting Addition to the Genre
","I am not a stainless fan of vampire movies, I just enjoy them when casually seeing one. I put them in the same bag that zombie flicks, so I have faith in the genre. This movie treats the story of a survivor group running away from a crew of Vampires, summoned in the darkness of an inevitable night. This optic more likely belongs to a class A Zombie, where they always run from their chasers, so expect changes.<br/><br/>""30 days of night"" follows an interesting premise, with a new perspective, that moved me to see it. In an isolated town in Alaska, which it summons into a month of darkness, inhabitants will have to fight with a bloodthirsty gang of vampires. The movie doubles your breathing rate, grips you to the seat and prepares you for the gore spectacle with previous innuendos: a music that is both eerie and attractive, like a northern wind blowing. The constant snow falling gives a ghostly appearance to the show, the dampened and subdued lights form the perfect stage for the action to develop and an appropriate, narrow fast editing. Thanks to the brutal make up and great acting, the Vampires look soul-less and real monsters, that are not moved by a logic, nor softened as Anne's Rice; but into their brutal needs of feeding like a hound of animals.<br/><br/>Always with your blood frozen and your hairs paralyzed, the movie just keeps you guessing when you are going to get a big sudden scare. There is an extensive make up work (basic for movies like these), that make vampires scary and impervious, frightening with the way they walk, move and gesture. Would I mind having one of them at home.<br/><br/>Remind you of the gruesome parts, where skin is torn down like play-doll, the fans and new experience seekers will be satisfied. There is a mild character development, where we only ground for few of them. <br/><br/>""30 days of night"" doesn't include a major budget. Expect what the poster and trailer promises. Tension, great action development, entertainment and:<br/><br/>-Oh yes, there will be blood."

","Wow ! I had my expectations set so high, and I did NOT get disappointed! Besides the visual, which I think in some shots are beautiful, this movie made me jump around 6 times, which is rarely seen! I also, for the first time really in a horror movie had my heart beating twice as fast the entire time, because I really lived myself into it ! If that is correct expression:) The reason it only gets 9 stars is because you get introduced to the vampires too fast IMO!

"intruderz_","6","36","67","17 October 2007"," Humorous to the Desensitized
","This movie centers around senseless violence with little character attachment, which means if you've seen any horror movies in the last two decades is not very new.<br/><br/>BUT This movie was interesting for three main reasons.<br/><br/>1) The violence is excessive, funny, and usually the best parts of the movie (in that Bruce Cambell kind of way).<br/><br/>2) There's no boring/forced emotional moments like 90% of Hollywood movies. It avoided cliché by seeming like its about to have this big emotional and moral moment after someone gets killed or the main characters bad relationship gets brought up. But then it cuts right back to the horror and violence. Right then, you could hear the audience let out a sigh, clearly bored of THAT formula.<br/><br/>3) The settings and premise. The town looks great and being completely cut off from the world with 30 days of no sunshine adds a great atmosphere and tension.<br/><br/>As for the actors, its the standard Hollywood mix. I found Josh to be decent (nothing special) and his ex-girlfriend was annoying and unattractive.<br/><br/>Besides that the movie has the standard mindless filler actors who do the really obvious stupid ideas like yelling in the streets.<br/><br/>To get right to the point, you'll get a good laugh and it's above average for its genre. Would I pay to see it again? Probably not but I'm happy I got free tickets to see a private screening."

","I went in with low expectations, and this film really surprised me. It's probably one of the best vampire films I've seen in a very long time. I don't want to say too much for those who have yet to see it, but these vampires in the film were unlike any I've seen before. I've read some reviews where people were unimpressed with Josh Hartnett and I don't typically care for him but I thought he did a fine job in this film. I was looking for him to screw it up and I was really impressed with his performance, thought he did a great job. One of the things I love about this film is that it fails to explain a lot of things, I know some people dislike that but I feel that too many explanations usually lead to the downfall of certain films. This was perfect, and I can't wait for it to come to DVD."

","What are the ingredients of good horror? A small, contained location and group of people. A situation that forces and magnifies events. A terrifying protagonist. Characters you care about. Authenticity. This movie has all of this in spades. The location is a tiny settlement in the Arctic Circle the day the sun disappears for 30 days during the polar winter. During these 30 days nothing comes in or out of the town. You miss the last plane out? You're staying. The protagonists are vampires, but, trust me, these guys don't do glitter. They are demonic and truly evil, and yet they have emotional depth as well. The characters in the movie are realistic--hard people shaped by their environment--and I wanted them to all pull through. Besides all this you have amazing authenticity to the location. The exterior shooting in the endless darkness is incredible. The sense of claustrophobia and fear that builds up will leave you breathless. Don't worry if you don't get what's happening for a while. It's designed to be like that, as though you are part of this thing that is happening. There are no spoilers in real life, and the characters have no idea what's about to hit them as minor, but horrible, occurrences start to build into a pattern. Just watch from the first enigmatic frame to the last and enjoy."

","30 Days of Night is set in the (very) small town of Barrow in Alaska which has the distinction of being the northern most town in the U.S., it is isolated in 80 miles of road-less wilderness which is cut off & plunged into total darkness all day every winter for thirty days straight. During this time the population of Barrow drops from 563 to 152 as most of the townspeople head to somewhere more hospitable for the winter, the few that do stay this particular winter are in for a rough time as a group of blood drinking Vampire like creatures descend on the town in order to kill everyone & drink their blood. A small group of assorted survivors lead by Sheriff Eben Olesen (Josh Hartnett) & his wife Stella (Melissa George) must try to hide & make it through the 30 days of night until helps arrives in the form of the sun...<br/><br/>This New Zealand & American co-production was directed by David Slade & this horror film did pretty good box-office back in 2007 & I have to say I rather liked it, I didn't think it was any sort of classic but I definitely liked it. The script by Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie & Brian Nelson was based on the Dark Horse graphic novel of the same name by Niles & is a pretty grim 'base under siege' type horror thriller that is best described as a cross between The Thing (1982) & John Carpenter's Vampires (1998) (coincidently both of which were directed by John Carpenter which means absolutely nothing, come to think of it it's not to dissimilar to Ghosts of Mars (2001) also directed by Carpenter...) as it's set in a freezing snow covered isolated location & features hordes of blood drinking vampires, it certainly takes itself very seriously & there isn't a light hearted moment in it but it is quite often very intense & I did like it's conviction. The character's are slightly better than what one would expect, both Sheriff Oleson & his wife have personality which makes the downbeat ending a bit of a bummer. I mean after watching a fairly grim & intense Vampire flick for 100 odd minutes featuring plenty of death & destruction I would have liked a bit more cheerful ending but that's just me. There's enough action & gore to satisfy hardened horror addicts although not all aspects of the story are as good as I would have liked. For instance who were the Vampires? Where did they come from? If it was blood they were after why did they kill people in such a way all their blood was splattered over the wall or floor? Why did that main Vampire at the end fight Sheriff Oleson? Why did all the other Vampires just stand there & watch as their leader was killed? Why didn't they then kill Oleson?<br/><br/>Director Slade does a very good job here & films with style in full 2:35:1 widescreen, some of the opening shots of the Alaskan horizon as the sun sets over the snow covered landscape looks great & he thankfully keeps his camera nice & steady so we can actually see the carnage. I loved the aerial shot from above the town as the camera moved over the main street as the vampires attack, there are huge red splodges of blood everywhere, fires burning & Vampires attacking people all viewed in one continuous cool looking shot from the sky! The special effects are impressive, both the CGI computer variety & the more traditional prosthetic make-up effects sort. The Vampire creatures look very good & quite intimidating, I love how they walk around with old blood stains from their victims on their faces & clothes & don't bother to wash it off. There's some good gore here as well, there is plenty of blood splatter with chopped off heads, decapitations, slashed & bitten out throats, gunshot wounds including Vampires having their heads literally shot off, blood drinking & a real crowd pleasing moment when a huge trench is used to carve up several Vampires as well as a cool scene at the end when a Vampire falls into a masher & is suitably mashed. The film has a good atmosphere & a real sense of isolation, there's some nice jump out of your seat moments too.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $32,000,000 30 Days of Night is well made with high production values. Although set entirely within the snow covered confines of Alaska in the U.S. 30 Days of Night was in fact filmed entirely in New Zealand. The acting is good from all involved, in case any football fans from the UK are wondering the main Vampire played by Ben Foster is not the same Ben Foster who is currently one of Manchester United's goalkeepers! Credit where credit is due Melissa George is nice & easy on the eye too.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night is a really good horror thriller that I enjoyed a lot, the story isn't quite as tight as I would have liked (how did that kid who popped up at the end survive for so long?) but it makes for good late night entertainment which might even give you a few scares. Followed by the made-for-TV mini-series 30 Days of Night: Blood Trails (2007)."
"BJBatimdb","2","114","243","4 November 2007"," One of the worst movies I've ever seen
","Oh! this film's so bad! What a waste of resources! I was lured into the cinema by the presence of Danny Huston after eye-catching performances in Ivans XTC and The Constant Gardener but how he got mixed up in this is anyone's guess. To give him credit, he is the best thing about this movie.<br/><br/>But he's so outweighed by rubbish there's no redemption. <br/><br/>The plot has got more holes in it than Dracula with cavities. The script is deplorable. The editing is so fast and annoying that I wanted to hit Pause. And - once you've seen a whole vampire - the tension is non-existent, and the film relies on gore and jumps for the duration. <br/><br/>The most ridiculous of MANY plot devices is that - after enduring 29 days and 16 hours of vampire hell (even though it seems about as hellish by the end as it did at the beginning - nothing is made of the sheer hardship that would have been faced, even without vampires lurking) Josh Hartnett decides that NOW is the time to turn himself into a vampire to give his wife a chance to escape.<br/><br/>Not only does turning himself into a vampire barely even make him a better fighter, but when he DOES create a decoy, the silly bint doesn't even take her chance to run away! She just stands and watches him. That's gratitude for you.<br/><br/>And THEN to add dumb insult to already itchy injury, Josh manages to suppress his new vampiric urges long enough to kill himself rather than rip her throat out. <br/><br/>The action jumps about without motive (including a convenient jerk from 'Day 7' to 'Day 27') the snow is wasted; the dark is wasted; the few clever things they do are wasted; the actors are wasted saying stupid, corny things. Any movie which includes in its first scene an actor slitting his eyes around the horizon and saying: 'Who would DO such a thing?' in response to some incinerated mobile phones, is a movie worth rushing out of immediately to get your money back. Sadly, I stayed put.<br/><br/>HOWEVER. In the interests of fairness, the overhead shot of the vampire attack is wonderful and the vampire make up is genuinely scary. I give it 1 mark for each of those things."
"Elswet","8","36","70","14 November 2007"," Lives Up To The Trailer
","I must admit that I have become a bit bored with the latest rash of Vampyre/Vampyrical cinematic attempts. I loved Underworld, but Underworld 2 led us somewhere so totally off the beaten path of the original, it left me cold. If you go all the way back to John Carpenter's Vampires, you'll delve right into some great Vampyre elements of the mythos, and some really creative innovations.<br/><br/>There have been good-to-great Vampyre movies since, strewn here and there. But the idea of having only 30 days to feed, each year ... ? THAT is a cool idea. But it's not new. Jeepers Creepers comes to mind ... every 29 years, they get to feed for 29 days. And yet, this film was highly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Action, suspense, tense (almost palpable) atmosphere, and believe it or not, believable performances by the cast! Hartnett surprises, but (unfortunately) part of his surprise is that he is the sheriff of this small Alaskan town. I do not know about anyone else, but I seem to have problems believing it. He gave an honest, realistic performance, but I could not buy him as the sheriff. I think it has more to do with his age and memories of him in other parts, than it does with his performance. As I said, his performance is believable ... more so than in anything else in which I have ever seen him, and that is a fact.<br/><br/>The execution of the elements was classic. I will refrain from detailing any particular element, as I hate to read a review that spoils everything in a movie, so I rarely write them.<br/><br/>I WILL, however, say that there were a few things with which I had a problem. Those things are enumerated below, so proceed at your own risk. They aren't spoilers outright, but a few could be POTENTIAL SPOILERS for someone who doesn't want ANYthing revealed.<br/><br/>As I've said, Josh Hartnett did not fit in as the sheriff. I could have much more easily accepted him as a deputy than as the actual sheriff.<br/><br/>He always looked too clean to meet the circumstances. They did give him a bit of grime, but nowhere near the amount of gore and dirt one would reasonably expect, under the circumstances.<br/><br/>The Vampyres were so visceral. I personally prefer the more romanticized versions, though I could buy into the premise that 1500 years of evolution could/would cause such an animalization of these Beings.<br/><br/>The filming during the kills is too ""busy."" The camera moves and the editing is so fast as to make you wonder if the camera man was having some sort of seizure during filming? The overall affect was to make me dizzy, without adding anything of substance to the film, itself. NOTE TO DIRECTORS: Slow it down and give us the graphic sequences you are too afraid to film! At least film alternate ""kills"" for the ""Unrated Director's Cuts"" if you MUST omit it for the PG-13 kiddies! But this was an ""R"" and THIS was the best you could deliver?!<br/><br/>The town itself had a ""canned"" feeling, like they filmed this thing on the back lot of some studio, or in a large stadium somewhere. The feeling of isolation is necessary, true enough, but the sense that this was constructed and executed at a location secondary to the place to which we were first introduced, should give one pause. If Sam Raimi could make a mistake like that, no one is infallible.<br/><br/>The use of the Infernal Promise, without going into the lore, or the mystery of the Infernal Promise, failed to please. (More on the IP in the next section.) I DID like that they included the Infernal Promise at all. It is used throughout the Vampyre genre with some great effect, but it was never better used than herein. The use of the IP also generated a secondary element I found delightful; that of the Stranger.<br/><br/>The Stranger brought with it the sense of foreboding, sealed and personified. It engendered a betrayal on a level to which the average man needs to believe other men are not capable. From his introduction, the viewer knows there is something amiss on the pristine snow-strewn horizon.<br/><br/>The use of the weather as a means of confounding the Vampyres' superior scenting abilities (done so subtly, as to negate this as a spoiler), and their method of covering the whole thing up, are both quite ingenious.<br/><br/>All in all? I really enjoyed this superior work of thriller/suspense. It is a definite Friday/Saturday night movie, and belongs on the shelves of anyone who enjoys a good Vampyre movie. I categorize this as a thriller/suspense, as the kills are not as graphic as I expected, the blood (while there, laws yes!) is not as prolific as I anticipated, and the gore is at a bare minimum. I'd actually pay to see this again.<br/><br/>It rates a 7.8/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

The setting is bleak and sufficiently creepy. The concept is absolute genius and the effects are state of the art. Vampire imagery is rarely portrayed in so savage a style without coming off as violence for violence' sake or just another attempt at the gross-out factor.

","As 30 Days of Night opens, the camera shows us horizons that stretch on for endless miles, snow as far as the eye can see, and a stranger that is wandering, seemingly, to his death. But as he crests the next ridge, we see he has spotted a town, not just any town, mind you, but Barrow (Salem's Lot anyone?) Alaska. The highest point in the U.S.<br/><br/>It is at this town, perched at the top of the world, that the gates of hell shall be opened, the nightmares of many will come true, and this little town will plummet from the top of the earth, and smash the lives of its residents to pieces.<br/><br/>I cannot stress enough how perfect this films' atmosphere is. It is some of the best I've seen in a long time. It lets you know that from the get go that this is a bleak, heartless, and most times hopeless place.<br/><br/>So, back to the story.<br/><br/>After the stranger is introduced, we switch over to Sheriff Eben Olsen and his partner Billy Kitka. They are standing over a pile of melted cell phones. Clearly, someone does not want E.T. phoning home.<br/><br/>They then get a call from the station, telling them that something has happened to one of the residents sled dogs.(guess what). There is also a subplot with Eben's wife, but I won't get into that.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film seems a bit rushed, and the rest of the film doesn't allow it to seem like these survivors are spending a month hiding from these Vampires.<br/><br/>Now let me tell you of these Vampires.<br/><br/>These are not your garden variety bloodsuckers here. They are feral beasts of violence and brutality. They don't run around in capes or a tux, and are not afraid of getting dirty. (At one point, the lead Vamp, played masterfully by Danny Huston, slicks his hair back with the blood of a fallen town person). They are athletic, strong as can be, and use group tactics to take down their prey. They are soulless, ruthless, and show no mercy. These are the real creatures of the night.<br/><br/>The acting you say? Well, Josh Hartnett is a little wooden in his portrayal of the leader of the survivors, and Melissa George is very competent as his wife and second in command, and the rest of the group does their job adequately, with the exception of one person.<br/><br/>Mark Boone, Jr. gives a stand out performance as a hermit who is caught up with the town folk, who come to rely on him.<br/><br/>On the villainous side of things, you couldn't ask for a better lead Vampire than Danny Huston. He brings a quiet menace and rage to his character which oozes out through the screen, and pools up in your lap until the end of the film. The rest of the gang also does their job, and that's about all I can say about them. Except for, once again, the Stranger, played by Ben Foster, (is there a villain this guy cant play to perfection?) He is the hailer of doom and death. Completely convinced that his masters will come back for him and repay him for his loyal service (we might as well call him 'Renfield').<br/><br/>Other than a rushed first 30 minutes, and what seems to be some script problems, I really enjoyed this movie. Its got the gore, the scares, and most importantly its got the villains, which might be some of the best put to the silver screen in a long time.<br/><br/>A solid 8 whacks to the neck with an ax, out of 10."
"rboy8","1","41","82","20 October 2007"," actually 30 days of nothing
","well i suppose from my summary you can tell that i was not impressed with this film. i feel once again like a stupid fool for getting all worked up for this movie after seeing the trailer and thinking about what an interesting concept this could be. what started out as something i might be able to get into turned into one of the biggest turgid messes of a train wreck that i have not witnessed in my 50 or so years of movie going. now mind you, i am one of the easiest guys to please. sometimes i go see a movie because i know that it is going to be a stinker and have a great time laughing at the horrible dialogue or completely out of kilter plot holes and so forth. as the film unspooled, i sat in amazement.......did he just say what i think he said? no. you mean to tell me that the director and screenwriters finished this half baked flawed project, went into the screening room and actually emerged with their heads held high and high- five-ing each other on a job well done? i know that making a film of any kind is not easy but come on! stale dialogue...stupid music cues for the horror discovery scenes and on and on. i want to know why the vampires, who at the beginning of the movie can run fast enough to catch a speeding car and can group together and lift one become more stupid and slower with each passing scene. at one point they are snatching bodies with lightning speed and at another the two leads are trapped in a car and the baddies just stand around and screech and make grabbing arm gestures that are easily fought off. huh? why did the vampires set out to kill everyone immediately and not pace themselves? it seemed like it was just killing for killings sake. no rhyme or reason. very very boring. Danny Huston was the best thing going for this film. i actually payed a little more attention when he was on screen. as for the ending, its the same old story. Hartnett goes mano e vampo with the lead vampire while all the others stand around and screech and do nothing to help kill Harnetts character. i actually felt no passage of time for the 30 days that passed and there was really no tension built up for any kind of climax what so ever. at the end of the movie when Josh Hartnetts character sits on the edge of the cliff and watches the sun come up with his lady love i would like to think that he is actually thinking of his career at this point turning to ashes just like his body. would somebody somewhere please please make a horror movie thats really fresh and even a little scary?"

","I don't know anything about the comic book this is based on but the trailers looked great (as all trailers do & are supposed to of course!) so I decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>The film is extremely slow to get going, sticking to the adage ""don't show your monsters too soon"". The film has classic horror ideas, ""town with no power"" & ""the phones are all out"". The 1st 3 attacks are shot too quickly and over as quick as they start. If their supposed to be heightening the suspense level they only succeeded in increasing my levels of annoyance and frustration.<br/><br/>The trouble with the film is it goes from nothing at all happening to a lot happening with no explanation or transition of events between, which makes the film seem very badly cut.<br/><br/>The monsters are vampires & when Hartnett finds one of the 1st to be attacked becoming a vampire it is clear the gore factor is going to be low (the attack with the Axe is implied) but does show the vampires can be killed.<br/><br/>The film is slowed down again, with a side story about a guys dad escaping the house (why were they whispering inside? Do vampires suddenly have super hearing?) but neither of them were characters we knew enough about to warrant caring if they lived.<br/><br/>Even after showing all the vampires they insisted on killing the son in a blurred attack. There's no point in hiding your monsters once we've already seen them. The trip to the store for supplies was bound to find a vampire once Hartnett didn't search the place when he first entered it. A vampire child was a nice touch though.<br/><br/>The attack by her was shot too fast and the camera was over-cranked too much. The female vampire hurt by bright light then suffering in pain was stupid. Why show your monster to be so weak? The guy attacking them from the JCB made them look even weaker & again shot too fast & over-cranked to hell. His driving into the shopfront seemed pointless and had no motive.<br/><br/>Why they waited so long to reveal the power station guy had been bitten by the girl is a mystery. It was obvious she'd bitten him so why wait 20 minutes for the guy to tell them himself is beyond me. This slowed the film down yet again, another bad idea.<br/><br/>Once we'd gone back into the shredding plant which was so unsubtly introduced at the start of the film it was a foregone conclusion that someone or something was going to fall or be pushed into it. Clearly someone had been stealing ideas from Wrong Turn 2: Dead End.<br/><br/>Predictably enough, after being attacked & bitten Billy pushed his attacker into the shredder (in a blink and you'll miss it moment) & lost an arm as well. Hartnett cutting off Billy's head with the Axe is about the goriest thing in the film.<br/><br/>With 15 or so minutes of film left to run and the biggest gimmick in the film already used I wondered how they were going to wrap this movie up, if they were going to take the ""everyone dies"" approach or ""the hero kills all the monsters"" approach or ""the hero gets infected and has to be killed"" approach or something else.<br/><br/>When their thinking about saving the female cop I was amazed that by this point no-one had introduced a hunting rifle with scope. This is a town that's bound to have bears & wolves close by and no-one seemed to have one? They were also saying that the following day was sun rise so 29 days had passed? The vampires using the oil pipeline to burn down the town is pointless. We already established they hate bright light (so they are going to hate fire), they already snatched and killed or infected most of the towns people (they said there were only 5 left alive in the jail). Saying it was done to cover their tracks so they could do the same thing again in another town is a very weak idea.<br/><br/>Likewise the idea of Harnett infecting himself (with Billys blood) to save the lady cop (Why not just let her and the person with her die, he didn't seem to care her about her anyway?), an equally bad plot device. Also we had already seen the vampires kill other vampires if they were injured or showed weakness so why he thought they'd let him anywhere near them in his partially infected state is beyond me.<br/><br/>Realistically Hartnett should never have been able to defeat any vampire in a straight fight. They looked like they'd been around a long time (the weird language indicated that too) and he'd had all of 2 minutes of being a vampire. Of course their fight was shot too fast and over-cranked like every other action scene in this film & I still couldn't really tell how the vampire was killed (shot it looked like but Hartnett lost his gun earlier in the film).<br/><br/>Having killed their leader the rest of the vampires leave what's left of the town and Hartnett is left to die and burn up as the sun rises (a scene stolen & lifted wholesale from Blade 2). You never see the whole process and we linger in the female cops eyes for a long time which is never explained.<br/><br/>An exceptionally weak ending in a really awful film that has no redeeming qualities at all."

","The title is completely irrelevant: Yes there the film covers 30 days but action only happens in about 3 of them. Almost everyone is killed in feeding frenzy on the first night, then its day 7 then day 14? then day 27 and presumably, finally 30 (They don't put text up for that but it's implied because the the sun is rising). There is no sense of time passing. On each day when something happens the action is kicked off by someone saying that they have to move on despite there being no obvious reason to do so other than to put themselves in danger and when they do move they always walk slowly down the middle of an unlit street that is brighter than mine is with a full moon and all the street lighting on!

I've watched horror movies and sci-fi for 50 years now, almost everything that's been done, and this is one of the few films in recent years that deserves to become a classic. There are a lot of scenes in here that gave me the same kind of shivers as the ""eclipse"" scene in Pitch Black did.<br/><br/>See it and judge for yourself, but if you really like horror films (and I don't mean dreck like Saw or the remake of House on Haunted Hill, for instance), don't be put off by the few negative reviews.

","I absolutely loved 30 Days of Night! It was the best film I have seen in a while, and it scared me right down to my boots! But this film was also very thrilling, action-packed and suspense-filled, with a massive showdown between the Chief of Police and the Head Vampire in the final sequence of the movie. An emotional and tear-jerking ending, but the rest of the movie was packed jam with action, suspense, terror and ruthless violence! The best vampire film of the year! I am just so full of compliments for this film. Josh Hartnett was great as the Chief of Police, and as the leader of a small band of survivors, who have to survive 30 Days of Night whilst their village comes under attack from a bunch of ruthless, flesh-eating vampires. The vampires were extremely terrifying, I thought! The most gut-wrenching, terrifying moment in the film, is where you see a small girl of no more than six years of age (who has obviously been transformed into a vampire) munching away on a human body. When she raises her head, her mouth is covered in blood, and she is as pale as a sheet. Her scream is truly blood-curdling, and she is terrifying! I really, really enjoyed this film. I loved the way that they had to survive thirty days, and that some days they would succeed in saving lost survivors, but other days some of them would die. A truly gripping, edge-of-the-seat film! The best horror movie I've seen! As per usual with horror films, the violence is quite horrific and they don't hold back on the decapitations, so if you're not sure on that sort of thing, then I would advise you not to watch the film. Some moderate drug and sex references, but it's not too bad. The film mostly focuses on the vampires and the small band of survivors.<br/><br/>Altogether, a great film, brilliantly acted and brilliantly directed! I REALLY enjoyed watching it. Perfect stuff."

","As Barrow, the most northerly city in Alaska, prepares for the heart of midwinter when the sun won't rise for thirty days something strange is going on. Somebody has stolen and destroyed all the cell phones, killed the sled dogs and sabotaged the only helicopter. Then a stranger turns up and is arrested; he tells his captors that none of them will survive what is coming! Soon after the attacks start; most of the townspeople are lost but a handful, including the sheriff and his estranged wife survive. They don't know if other groups survived but they do know that if they are found they will almost certainly be killed.<br/><br/>It isn't often that a film brings something new to the vampire genre but this does; these aren't the gothic counts seducing their victims or characters with grand plans; they are more like feral beasts giving into wild urges. In many ways this is more like a zombie film as they control the town, feeding on anybody who they catch. Similarly their appearance is scary; most of them have a permanent 'beard of blood' from where they have feasted on their victims. The isolated setting gives a claustrophobic atmosphere; the characters know they can't leave town as the frozen wilderness would kill them as surely as the vampires. As one would expect there are plenty of deaths, both human and vampire, these are varied and occasionally amusing in a dark way... they are also disturbing at times. The cast is solid with Josh Hartnett and Melissa George doing decent jobs as the sheriff and his wife; however Danny Huston impresses most as Marlow, the head vampire. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to this who prefer gory vampires to sparkly ones!"

","I loved this movie. It's extremely violent and bloodthirsty, which is not my usual cup of tea. But the story is so good and so original, and the characters so believable, the violence sort of works. In case you're not aware, it is based on a comic book, which is also well worth a read,and has been fairly faithfully reproduced. With the action being based in a town which is permanently in darkness for 30 days, gives a relentless, claustrophobic feel to the proceedings. Throw in some spectacular, but not over used, special effects and a great ending, and there you have it, a 9 star movie for me. (In case anyone is wondering,Salem's Lot, the original tele-movie for sheer creepiness, Blade and Let Me In are all right up there as well.)"
"Hey_Sweden","8","4","5","26 December 2011"," A fun fright flick.
","It's always nice to see a different take on a genre. One may find out that it's not wholly original, but at least it will be something that they themselves haven't seen before. In this case, the idea of ""vampires in the snow"", turned into a successful graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith, did intrigue this viewer. These blood suckers are a particularly animalistic and aggressive - and unrelentingly merciless - bunch, led by a monster named Marlow (Danny Huston). They come upon the small Alaska town of Barrow, the Northern most town in the entire United States, which regularly experiences the natural phenomenon of a whole month without sunlight - which gives our survivors, including intrepid young sheriff Eben (Josh Hartnett) one more thing to worry about, and the villains one less thing. Can Eben and his fellow intended victims hold out for that long? Commendably, never once do these filmmakers intimate that there will definitely be some sort of happy ending. The atmosphere is just overwhelming, and the creation of this remote wintry town, with on location filming in New Zealand, is impressive to behold. While there are clichés to be found in this screenplay, we never learn much about the motivation of the vampires themselves - which don't adhere to all vampire ""rules"", as they can be eliminated with bullets - making them enigmatic entities indeed, and the human element is never lost. One can believe that these are real human beings, with all of their imperfections, that are at risk here. Some absolutely beautiful shots at beginning and end truly show off the majesty - and danger - of this landscape. There's tons of violence and gore to satisfy some tastes, and some decent suspense to go along with it. However, some of the best stuff revolves the ""God's eye"" view of the town as it gets completely ravaged by this seemingly unstoppable force, creating a feeling of utter helplessness. Hartnett actually does a pretty good job in the lead, with Melissa George appealing as his leading lady, and capable support by Ben Foster as the weirdo stranger who helps to signal the arrival of the enemy, Mark Boone Junior as scruffy, solitary local Beau, and Mark Rendall as younger brother Jake. It's also nice to see Peter Feeney, the greedy, tweedy bad guy from the splatter comedy ""Black Sheep"", in a small role, and Huston, son of the legendary John H. and half-brother of Angelica H., making a pretty strong impression in this role that never receives much elaboration. Stylish, energetic filmmaking makes this a good entertainment with a strong dose of nastiness along the way. Eight out of 10."
"jusg-2","2","32","65","30 October 2007"," Chliched, dull and unpleasant
","The idea is good. I have to give them that. Vampires can only hunt at night so they choose to go to a place that goes a whole month without daylight, a small Alaskan town of a couple of hundred inhabitants. The film is nicely directed, the cast is decent. I don't like Josh Hartnett, but since i saw Slevin, i was more than wiling to see how he'd go about a horror movie. So really the base is there, but i just found the whole thing terribly boring and predictable. It indulges itself in violence, and everything in this film other than a whole month for vampires to go on a rampage (which is an adaption as far as i'm aware) has been done before. The vampires costumes look like those in Blade, there is a man eating child, like interview with the vampire, for some reason still speaking in English rather than the pathetic vampire dialect the others seem to prefer, and then turns to screaming just when you would expect her to. There is the obvious collaborator who, while in a prison cell tells the know-it-all police officer JH that everyone is going to die, but alas no one believes him, other than hero Josh's winy brother (who of course overcomes his fear of basically everything later on in the film) Now, while idea behind the storyline is really quite cool i think, the plot itself is shallow as. It's essentially Josh Hartnett kicking ass with the one or two mess-ups which have to be sorted out by one of his companions. And while the film is fairly quick and you won't be left waiting for blood for long once the story got going, the plot is dead slow. The film is about a month of sheer agony, fear and desperation for the people in that town, in which every day can be their last. The film gives you a time frame by showing the days that have passed since the vampires came to town and the sun disappeared. Now the gaps between these are ridiculous. At one point there is a 10 day gap between the last day shown and the one it's about now. Not even a vague idea is given where the vampires come from, (even from dusk till dawn tried that). Actually you cannot even say for sure if they actually are vampires. Of course they have the characteristics, drinking blood, afraid of light etc, but the word vampire is never mentioned once. So technically, if you have never heard of vampires before watching this, you would have no idea what's going on. Now while that is fairly unrealistic to assume about anyone, i reckon it is kind of important for a film to be able to stand for itself. The single most annoying thing though, which eventually ruined the whole film completely for me was the ending. It makes no sense. The 'day' before the sun comes up again, our hero Josh makes a last stand against the vampires in order to save his girl while the whole town is in flames, by injecting vampire blood(..), turning himself into a semi-vampire, who can smell human blood and is not attacked by other vampires, but doesn't have the urge to kill and drink blood. Now how he knows that doesn't become evident, it is simply fed to the audience, that this is the only chance they have (while i guess waiting for a couple of hours till the sun comes up would have done the trick itself). So Josh kills the uber vampire, while the others don't try to stop him and simply walks back to his pals sitting in the dark. He then looks at his last sunrise together with his girl, and turns to ashes. And that's it. Now how much can you criticise a film like this for not being logical, unrealistic or far fetched? My two favourite vampire films are From Dusk Till Dawn and Interview With a Vampire, obviously for completely different reasons. FDTD makes a perfect example of how to make a splatter comedy without taking itself seriously for a single moment. IWAV takes itself very seriously, but vampires are more of a medium to ask deeper questions, especially what it would be like to live forever. 30 Days of Night however tries to be a horror movie yet it cannot live up to anything that's been done before on a similar topic, given its shallow plot, its unbelievable main character and far too many question marks rising while watching it. The idea behind the story, as i've said before, is cool, but - unfortunately - the rest simply sucks."

","This was a great zombie film, and I love zombie films.... Wait.. This was a vampire film? Seriously? Really? The plot line of this film is identical to just about every zombie film I've ever seen. The film makers couldn't decide whether to make a vampire film or a zombie film, so... they made both! Actually, I would give this 2 stars as a vampire film, but 7 stars as a zombie film... so... go with zombie film! When will someone convince Hollywood that shaky camera shots and split second cut scenes are disorienting, not scary. They took a premise that, in the hands of a remotely competent kindergarten teacher, could have become an incredibly horrifying terror opus. Instead, they delivered the Lost Boys meet the Dawn of the Dead. And the vampires were without a doubt the dumbest vampires I have ever seen portrayed in print, or in film. Quote: ""We've spent thousands of years convincing them (humans) that we are nothing but bad a bad dream.""... and this AFTER they come tearing into town with all the subtlety of a gas-fire tornado! Unbelievable. The most telling thing to me was the number of people that left our screening complaining of being cheated. But as I said earlier, as a zombie film it was pretty okay... so if you feel you must see this film, for God's sake, wait 'til it's a rental, or it's on cable!"
"beckwith10","8","13","23","22 October 2007"," Clever, Visually Inventive Horror Film
","I ordinarily might have skipped a film like this  there's enough lousy, third rate horror being pumped into the multiplexes these days. However, when I saw Slade's name under the directing credit, I thought differently and decided to give Thirty Days of Night a shot. Hard Candy, Slade's prior film, is a maverick work, unlike anything I've seen before. Certainly a shocker in its own right, Hard Candy is a marvelous original in the best, tough-minded pulp noir sense. Slade, working with but one set and not a pixel of CGI silliness, relied heavily on the acting strength of two terrifically well-cast principals to give Hard Candy the unique tension required to make it work - and it works. Slade not only got the performances he needed, he also demonstrated he can work effectively on a small scale, a sure sign of an exceptionally resourceful, inventive director. Thirty Days posed an altogether different challenge on a much larger scale; it's heavily atmospheric, with some big set pieces, and a big cast that battles through some frightening weather. Because of the perpetual ""night"" backdrop - a terrific idea, incidentally, for a vampire film - the visual palette is largely a grayish monochrome, set off with graphic touches of red and fiery oranges. This gives the film a moody, claustrophobic tone of growing dread that never falters and nor feels tedious to look at. If anything, it's hypnotic. 30 Days offers up some bravura visual moments - midway, there's a gorgeous, omniscient overhead tracking shot of the snowy town landscape stained with vampire carnage, and in the final sequence, the band of vampires stand clustered together watching as the town becomes engulfed in flames; both are brilliant bits of apocalyptic Gothic imagery worthy of a medieval Brueghel painting. While Hartnett, as the principal lead, provides the film's earnest, emotional core, his expressions filled with increasingly apprehensive flickers, quietly calculating the bleak prospect of survival he and the rapidly diminishing group of townspeople face, it's Danny Huston, as the lead vampire, who's over-the-top, chewing the blizzard-choked scenery and having a ball - or is it a snowball - doing it. (I'd hate to condemn as fine a character actor as Huston to type casting, but should Langella ever hang up the cape and fangs for good, Huston could easily pick them up.)Huston serves it up cold, meaty and raw here, and he's terrific to watch in what would otherwise be a throwaway role.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I should mention, the NYT did a genuine disservice with its review of ""Thirty Days of Night."" They sent in a third string reviewer who penned a smug, knee-jerk dismissal, and who clearly didn't know what he was looking at. Scott or Darghis should be sent in to re-review. Yes, Thirty Days is not perfect - there's some slipshod editing at points and Slade misses some great opportunities: the initial dialogue sequence between the Vampires - where we first get a good look at them and they are introduced as characters (not fast-moving homicidal blurs) is inserted haphazardly and without the proper dramatic build up, and Slade has a tendency to resort to chaotic, rapid cut editing in the action sequences, which merely translates as so much visual nonsense (The recent Bourne film suffered from this as well.) That may be fashionable in commercial action films these days, but Slade is smart enough to know better. All in all, though, Thirty Days is still a fine and worthy effort, and I think Slade has promise as an exceptional director and is somebody to watch in future."

","When you have to ask yourself if you want to see a Vampire movie, you know there is a good chance you may not want to. But you, that particular person, should watch the trailer. Watch that scene of the vampire on the top of the SUV. Notice the style with which that scene is shot. Doesn't it give you a feeling of nostalgia in a way? Perhaps that scene gives you memories of ""vampire movies when vampires seemed real"". Memories of what was scary was the vampire itself and not just what it does. I am here to tell you that is the case with this movie.<br/><br/>I was caught up in trying to understand this vampire movie from the start. In the opening, the one lonely man trekking across the snow covered tundra - is he villain or victim? And what was it behind him as well as ahead of him? How do puny humans defeat creatures that feed on fear and blood when they have so little to give them help or hope? It's a story in a nearly barren snow covered village that empties out once a year because it is that time when everyone knows they will not see the light of day for 30 days. A few remain, willingly or not. Some will see the light of day and some will not, nor should they.<br/><br/>This is not just one that offers you blood by the case. You get that and talent that doesn't go to waste. The talent is in the writing, cinematography, direction, makeup and performances. These vampires were going to take care of business and had no time for fancy kung-fu or flashy dialogue. They wanted blood, they smelled blood and they took blood.<br/><br/>While there were slow periods which gave me time to think to myself, ""Hmm, that's Josh Hartnett"" and a couple lines that made me wonder, ""Hey, where is Josh Hartnett"", I left the movie thinking, ""Hey, that was Josh Hartnett and he was great!"". But you will give credit to all the actors in this movie. I loved watching Melissa George, Mark Boone(Flass from Batman Begins), Ben Foster(Charlie Prince in 3:10 to Yuma) and all the very creepy vampires who reminded me why vampires scared me when I was a kid. An especially creepy vampire was Danny Huston who played the head vampire, Marlow. Danny Huston, in my opinion, gives Bela Lugosi a run for his blood money.<br/><br/>Thank you director David Slade(whose Hard Candy I will have to see now) and Writer Stuart Beattie(Pirates of the Caribbean).<br/><br/>8 of 10"

","There are many different cinematic varieties of Vampires. From the archetypal Dracula of Christopher Lee complete with cape to the much more sensually erotic creatures envisioned by Anne Rice. From the the cyberpunk bloodsuckers of Blade to the party animals of Tarantino's classic From Dusk Til Dawn. For me at least, the Vampires in 30 Days Of Night really hit the mark. They are nothing short of relentless killing machines. There is a rarely portrayed ferocity in their attacks and their feeding. These are the types of vampires that makes the Hammer versions look positively appealing! They're Scary! But I'm going to be straight here - this film certainly isn't going to win any Acadamy Awards. Not that its a bad film - far from it - but (other than the vamps) it doesn't really have anything new to offer the audience.<br/><br/>The acting is competent. Both Harnett and George put in good performances and the support is good. The lead vampire steals every scene he's in. But that could be because he looks like a demented Neil Tennant from the Pet Shop Boys! The story motors along at a healthy pace and the shocks are there to keep you on your toes. I was caught out a couple of times and paid the price by seeing my heart rate rocket! It will make most people jump a few times and there's enough blood to keep the attention of the gore-happy.<br/><br/>My only major concern was the film rating. In the UK it is 15. There are a couple of scenes in the film that i wouldn't want my 15 year old kids watching. So any parents out there please be aware that IMHO the censor slipped up.<br/><br/>All in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film.

"Mr_Saxon","8","5","7","3 December 2007"," The Best Vampire Movie Since Blade 2
","Based on the acclaimed graphic novel of the same name, 30 Days Of Night utilises a premise so obvious that you wonder why it's never been filmed before. A small Alaskan town is plunged into darkness for thirty days of the year and a small army of vampires decide to make use of the lack of light to indulge in a feeding frenzy.<br/><br/>The vampire genre in the celluloid world has become somewhat tired over the years and the familiarity we have them has lessened their impact. However, 30 Days Of Night goes some way towards refreshing things by portraying vampires as primal creatures which run around in packs ripping out throats with rows of needle-like teeth and spraying blood all over the place. Make no mistake; these aren't your Anne Rice vampires. These things are lethal killing machines with more in common with a group of wild dogs than human beings. They don't want to seduce you. They want to suck your veins clean as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>This is a bloody movie - and rightly so. A wonderful scene early in the movie shows the impact of the vampires' rampage throughout the town as the camera flows overhead following trails of red which glisten upon the pure white snow. These things are messy eaters you see - imagine thirty days of gorging on blood and never wiping your face, and that's what these vampires look like.<br/><br/>That's not to say that these vampires have no personality. The lead vampire in particular (played by the wonderful Danny Huston - an actor whose performances I've enjoyed in Children Of Men and The Constant Gardener) is an identifiable character dripping in menace whilst peering at his victims with soulless black eyes.<br/><br/>The human characters are well cast here and each gets their own moment to shine. I've never really been a big fan of Josh Hartnett but he does a good job at portraying a man whom others look up to. As the town's Sheriff, the job of protecting the few survivors falls to him and you can see the pain and grief on his face as those around him are gradually turned into slabs of bloody meat. <br/><br/>That this is David Slade's second feature length movie after Hard Candy is certainly impressive. Every shot captured by the cameras is a thing of beauty and manages to translate the soul of the graphic novel to the screen. I enjoyed the fact that the story gets moving almost from the first scene. You won't have to sit through half an hour of character back-story - the town's attack is already in motion by the time the opening credits have rolled.<br/><br/>30 Days Of Night is, without a doubt, one of the best horror movies of 2007 and I look forward to seeing Slades' next feature, whatever it be."
"jamhorner","9","5","7","22 October 2007"," Cold Hearted Fun
","What is 30 Days of Night but another great adaptation of a great comic book. After successful comic movies like Sin City and 300, a more gorier and scarier comic book has been transformed into a movie. This movie has everything that a vampire flick should have from the excessive gore, to the pale looking bloodsuckers, to the charismatic feel of the villain, to the intensity of violent vampire attacks, all jam packed in a 2-hour movie. I loved this movie for many reasons but the main reason why this movie struck high on my horror-meter was because of the uniqueness of having vampires invade Alaska of all places. We all know about their months without sun (Insomnia), but none of us really knew how a vampire could use that to his or her advantage.<br/><br/>The one thing that really blew my mind away about this movie was the excellent performance by Josh Hartnett, who we all know did some pretty OKAY performances back in the past (The Faculty, Halloween H2O and Pearl Harbor). This movie should probably be considered as Hartnett's best performance in a long, long time. This movie really distinguishes him as an actor that doesn't have to play horrible teenage rolls, with the exception of Black Hawk Down. As for the other performances, they were awesome. The horrifying and calm performance by Danny Huston was so believable and so scary that it was scary enough for him to just stand there with his mouth open. I thought he looked like Tom Hanks for a minute. Other great performances that I should credit would be Mark Rendall who played Hartnett's brother, Ben Foster as The Stranger and Megan Franich who played one of the more creepier vampires of the clan.<br/><br/>The blood and horror were there, no doubt about it. Vampires jumping out from behind closed doors and sides of houses, vampires crawling up on the roofs of buildings, vampires viciously attacking people and taking out their heads and stomachs. I think that the most disturbing and creepiest part of the entire movie would be the little girl vampire but I will only say that about this movie. The other horror elements made this concoction more violent and mal-adjusted than any other vampire movie. I don't want to explain too much about the horror without revealing any key plot points but I will say this, the vampires are scarier than any that I have ever seen. But what do you expect with performances like Huston, Franich, John Rawls and Andrew Stehlin? Another great element that makes this movie worth seeing is the great scenery and establishing shots. The camera angles and cinematography where so stylized and unique, that it actually looks like it came directly from the comic book. The shots had depth to them, not just headshots and cheesy widescreen views but it incorporated great pans and zooms that gave the viewer a better perception of what was going on. Case in point, when the vampires destroy the town, it used a great beginning shot of Huston standing by what he had created, along with his fellow vampires in the background, but they were someone hidden behind the whole mess. For some shots, of course, they used the same technique that Sin City and 300 used where the actor was behind a green screen and the scenery used sharp contrasts, giving it a more believable comic book feel. In fact, the whole set of the Alaskan town was pretty good.<br/><br/>I do believe, and I certainly hope, that this movie does not just go down as another mindless vampire flick because, to contrary, it was not. It was much more that just your average bloodsucker movie, it was a roller coaster ride into hell with a few hills that barley reach to heaven. It was charismatic, suspenseful, horrifying and, at points, funny. I would strongly recommend this movie to anybody who is a fan of the bat-and-fang genre and even more to those who love a good scare. It was a great movie to see. Just think how much limelight that Alaska has gotten these past weeks."

","David Slade brings to the table a fun and chilling vampire flick with great pizazz and a straightforward plot to where the movie doesn't get too caught up in itself with twists and unnecessary edginess to give the viewer plain out fun and enjoyment from the get-go. Sure, this movie is no Oscar nominee, but it was excellently done and I found myself surprisingly enticed in the plot and characters with an intensity. The actors and actresses do a lot better than you would think with their somewhat tasteless characters and you can get into them because they're not so tasteless as the script calls for. <br/><br/>Josh Hartnett is fantastic, David Slade directed just fine and all the other cast and crew did a very pleasing job with this movie. I thought the vampires were a little unoriginal, and in this case that's a bad thing, and the movie, like I said, not getting too fed up with itself does enough at times to make it seem unsavory, and make it seem like a ""big, bad"" film when it really just should've went with the flow, and even though it's definitely not Hard Candy, it's non-stop gratification just like Hard Candy was and I was very pleased with it."

","30 Days of Night is directed by David Slade and written by Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie and Brian Nelson. It stars Josh Hartnett, Melissa George, Danny Huston, Mark Boone Junior and Ben Foster. Music is by Brian Reitzell and cinematography by Jo Willems.<br/><br/>Every year for thirty days the town of Barrow, North Alaska goes without sunlight. This year Barrow has visitors, Vampires<br/><br/>Based on Steve Niles' own graphic comic, 30 Days of Night strips the vampire characterisation down to the core and triumphs because of it. There is nothing dandy or sexy about the vampires who have come to Barrow to feed for a month, these are ugly feral, insect like beasts who speak in their own language. The backdrop is a cold and snowy small town where no daylight is due for weeks, the population small, is about to become smaller with every passing hour. The set-up and execution is well handled by Slade (Hard Candy), antagonists and protagonists introductions are smooth, then the carnage unfolds and we shift into a tense game of cat and mouse as Hartnett, his estranged wife (George) and a few hardy souls try and survive until the 30 days of night have passed. And of course kick some vampire ass where possible.<br/><br/>Problems arise with the fact that it never once feels like more than one night of horror, so the questions of sleep, eat and toilet habits don't come into until you start to realise this is spread over 30 days! Is that picky? Well no not really, especially since there is little to no depth of characterisations to feed off either, back story is minimal and only reserved for Hartnett and George to let us know they are separated but love each other, thus our hero has something extra to fight for! For a story spread over 30 days it sure does lack, erm, story. Yet the constant sense of dread, a number of breath holding scenes and some bona fide bloody terror, ensures that it's a thrilling addition to the vampire splinter of horror. Cast performances are fine for the material to hand, with Huston as the lead vampire standing out and tech credits elsewhere, again, are perfect for the material as written.<br/><br/>Don't think about it too hard and there's a great time to be had here, while it makes for a great double with The Mist (also 2007). 7.5/10"

","Don't get me wrong - I'll watch almost anything, and give almost anything an even chance.

Some of the vampires are walking around with bloodstains on them for days at a time - blood that had dried and begun to crack and flake off...<br/><br/>When the group of survivors is holed up in the attic for a week straight how did they survive? They couldn't have used the bathroom for fear of attracting the vampires, so a bucket or similar must have been used. Seven or so people in a confined space, for seven days, without bathing, and using a bucket would smell so bad that the vampires could smell them from the other side of town!!<br/><br/>They walked around in the attic with such lack of care that they clomped and thudded, yet were never heard. When they flipped back the paper covering the window to watch the 'bait' scene - that flash of light would have been an immediate give-away to vampires with darkness adapted eyes (hell it would be an immediate give away for humans with darkness adapted eyes).<br/><br/>In short - while I really wanted this movie to work, and it sounded great in theory, the actual production sucked.

"willy2004","Null","20","40","15 October 2007"," A horror film that is actually quite frightening
","30 Days of Night is the latest entry in a long line of vampire horror movies. Vampires have sort of gone out of vogue in the horror world recently, replaced by decomposing, lumbering zombies. Director David Slade's movie tries to get vampires back in the thick of the scare business, and he has a gimmick. 30 Days of Night takes place in an isolated Alaskan town which, since it's so far north, spends 30 days of the year in complete darkness.<br/><br/>As gimmick's go, it's a good one. As the sun sinks toward the horizon for the last time, most of the tiny town's 500 or so residents leave, preferring migration south rather than 30 days without sun. Some however, always choose to remain and the small town's sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) marks the beginning of their 30 days of dark by adjusting their population sign to reflect its 152 remaining residents. Meanwhile, the vampires are already plotting. Someone has begun vandalizing key areas of the little village's infrastructure. Satellite phones are stolen, and burned. The town's helicopter is mysteriously damaged beyond compare. Something is afoot, but before Oleson can figure it out, the sun is gone and it's game over.<br/><br/>The vampires come on the town suddenly, and in force. The power goes out, the phones go down, the internet is gone. The nearest town is 80 miles away, there is no sun, there is no hope, no chance of defense, no semblance of order. This isn't a siege movie where the brave sheriff holes up in a police station with a group of survivors and defends them against an attacking evil. With the disappearance of light, the handful of residents left in the dark become rabbits, helpless scared creatures whose only hope is a quick death.<br/><br/>Except it takes them a few hours to figure this out. Meanwhile, the vampires' attack is an orgy of brutal violence and blood spatter as humans run out into the street brandishing weapons, mistakenly thinking they can actually fight. Each attempt at self-defense is marked by a red stain on the snow, and soon the defenders are gone and the vampires move on to crashing through houses and killing everyone else. By then Sheriff Oleson and the few people he has running with him have started to realize out they have no hope, and like the prey they are, go to ground praying that they can wait for the sun's return.<br/><br/>They can't. The vampires keep coming, keep killing, keep hunting. They're an unstoppable force and Slade never makes the mistake of letting you think his human characters have a chance. He's so good at it, that when something does go right for them you're surprised. Even then, there's always a horrible price.<br/><br/>The film goes extremely heavy on the gore; heads are brutally severed in extreme close-ups, blood drips through the snow leaving stains of death everywhere the camera goes. There's an aerial shot in the middle of the film which will simply blow the mind of gore-hounds, as a camera sweeps over the town in the midst of the vampires' most vicious, massive, killing frenzy. But what's amazing is that gore isn't what the movie is about. It's intense and gripping, so intense that even though you're watching one of the goriest movies you've ever seen, you may not even notice. You're too caught up in what's going to happen next. Are the vampires coming? Will they run? Will they hide? Will anyone make it out alive? If there's anything wrong with 30 Day of Night, it's only in the final act when the movie's dwindling supply of heroes make one of those truly bizarre decisions that people only seem to make in movies. And perhaps you'll walk out feeling a little indifferent to Josh Hartnett, who's not ineffective as the movie's primary protagonist, but it's clear that bringing heat to the cold just isn't his thing.<br/><br/>Ben Foster however, shows up early in the movie to turn in his second great villain performance of the year. In 3:10 to Yuma he stole the film as a perfectly groomed uber-murderer, here does a 180 and plays a grungy, slimy, stranger who wanders into town and causes trouble. As he did in Yuma, he slips completely into the character until he's almost unrecognizable. It's unfortunate that they didn't find a way for him to figure more prominently into the script. He leaves an impression.<br/><br/>Most of all though, see 30 Days of Night if you want to be scared. It's so rare that a modern horror movie actually delivers that. Most seem to boil down to buckets of gore or cheap, easily spotted scares. 30 Days of Night brings the gore, but mixes it with a brutal, vicious, nail biting intensity that grabs you by the hair, drags you through the street, and cuts off your head when you least expect it. David Slade hasn't revolutionized the vampire genre, but he may make you wet your pants."
"editor-92","6","16","31","10 October 2007"," Not great; not bad
","Set in Barrow, Alaska, the most remote location in the United States, ""30 Days of Night"" is what happens when you take John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and throw it into a blender with ""Dracula."" The film begins just before, yes, you got it, 30 days of no sunshine are about to arrive, and a large number of residents are making a mass exodus. They apparently can't ""handle"" the long month. A number of people stay behind, but they have more to worry about than seasonal affective disorder; they have vampires waiting to feast on their blood. Playing the sheriff is Josh Hartnett, who is frequently maligned for his lack of facial expression. He's not too bad here; he has a few good moments. His character is going through a separation of sorts from his wife. That whole relationship situation takes up more screen time than necessary. The first part of the film drags a bit. Ben Foster gets a lot of extreme close-ups in the first five minutes. He must be a sort of Renfeld, complete with shabby dress and horrible hygiene. I'm still wondering where he got that God awful accent. Once the vampires descend, fronted by Danny Huston, most recently of The Number 23. He speaks two words in English - No God - and then the rest of the time in a foreign tongue. It sounded Eastern European. His sidekicks, and there are plenty, have very strange, almost funhousesque faces. Not sure why that would be. If you like violence, well this should be a treat. There are some pretty graphic scenes, especially towards the end. And some good support from lesser known actors. You can't compare this film to something like ""Michael Clayton,"" so why bother? You know if this film will appeal to you or not. Do you like vampires? Like to watch some people fighting for their lives? Like that Gothic edge? Well, then you won't cringe too much during ""30 Days of Night."""
"Caractacus23","1","18","36","24 April 2008"," The worst movie I've seen in years! I hated it!
","Seriously, this movie is absolutely terrible. There are so many moronic holes in the plot that its positively obscene. The main characters all should have died about twenty times over, largely due to their own stupidity, but somehow, the vampires just keep inexplicably not locating them while they (loudly) hole up in a series of attics and basements (while constantly peeking out little windows and otherwise doing idiotic crap that would clearly spell their doom). The vampires can search every other building in the small town (Barrow, Alaska), but for some reason, they never search the one they are in. The vampires can station sentinels upon various high points in the town, but somehow never see them as they run, a parade of imbeciles literally careening through the streets, from one hiding place to the next (for seemingly no reason what-so-ever). Half the time the lighting is so bad that you can't tell what's going on anyway, as if it matters. I mean, I know its supposed to be a month of night and all, but does that mean that we the audience aren't allowed to see the action?<br/><br/>There are so many things about this movie that are so darn annoying that I literally began rooting for the vampires, and wishing for the deaths of all the so-called protagonists (the vampires are the real protagonists; people like the characters in this movie basically should be hunted down and torn to shreds - I would have turned Renfield and aided the vampires). One thing you ""learn"" about Barrow, Alaska while watching this movie is that, apparently, no one who lives there ever takes a shower, or ever so much as washes their face. Each actor seems to cavort around with about an eighth of an inch of shiny grease and random particulate matter splattered all over their mugs in every single scene - even in the early, pre-sunset scenes before the actual vampires show up to kill all these worthless, unhygienic dorks. Oh, and the sheriff is some 23-year old underwear model-type who looks like a young Keanu Reeves. Yeah, I'm sure that really fits the profile of rural Alaskan sheriffs.<br/><br/>And while this last may seem like a strange and irrelevant point, believe me, as one who had to sit through this waste of celluloid, if it had happened just one more time, I think I would have screamed and just ended this cinematic abortion right there. You see, they refer to electrical generators about ten times during this movie. But with a single exception, they never call them generators. They always call them ""gennys."" I just can't impart to you how incredibly annoying it was to watch a bunch of greasy-faced, Hollywood, metrosexual retards pretending they were rednecks by saying ""genny"" when they meant ""generator."""

Barrow is as about far north as a town can get and as a result during the winter the town spends thirty days in complete darkness. The remaining townsfolk must fend for their lives when the town comes under the attack of a band of nasty vampires looking to drain the town dry. Will the Sheriff (Hartnett) help the survivors who are cut off from the rest of the world by paying the ultimate price? <br/><br/>Thoughts: Director David Slade (fresh off the popular ""Hard Candy"") creates a nicely stylized adaptation of the popular graphic novel. The grimy, disgusting vampires make for a wonderfully tense time as the darkness and setting make for some quick and fun gruesomeness. I'm not the biggest Hartnett fan but he and the rest of the cast do a fine job conveying the terror and the lead vampire is particularly nasty to behold. <br/><br/>In Conclusion: ""30 Days of Night"" is a wonderfully welcomed change of pace to the tired vampire genre. It has plenty of excellent technical design should give vampire fans something to sink their teeth into and the comic fans to be happy about."

","It is with day-glo irony that one character in ""30 Days of Night"" makes an offhand reference to cinema's penultimate bloodsucking actor, Bela Lugosi. While the original Universal ""Dracula"" remains the cornerstone of cinematic vampire lore, the way of the mythic creatures has gone into hyperdrive in the last few years, most visibly in the ""Underworld"" series. Yes, it seems that vampires just aren't that interesting anymore, unless they're screeching, howling, hurtling through the air at great speed, and outfitted with the latest in repulsive denture prosthetics.<br/><br/>Director David Slade, who began his career directing music videos before graduating to features with last year's overrated ""Hard Candy,"" does an impressive job establishing a bleak visual tone in the small community of Barrow, Alaska. Throughout the movie, the chilly atmosphere was so convincing it kept an ice-cold grip on my spinenot since John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" has isolation been established with such bone-chilling desperation.<br/><br/>""30 Days""attempts an alchemy on a stagnant movie monster with only marginal success, since the script (co-written by Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie, and Brian Nelson) really isn't up to snuff. We get a few main characters who are defined just enough (in admittedly cliché parts) to earn our sympathy, followed by maybe a dozen supporting characters who exist A) solely to be picked off; or B) recite monologues we couldn't possibly care about before getting picked off. A big no-no in horror films is trying to give bit players depth when their demise is nigh. In the meantime, a lot of the humans' actions are Fright Film 101 stuff, running the gambit from simple clichés (at least half the movie is spent asking who/what the vampires are) to the idiotic (grandfather flees hiding place, possibly blowing the other survivors' cover; grandson dutifully follows after, yelling after gramps). Similar territory was covered more intelligently, and with a keener awareness of genre convention, in Carpenter's ""Thing."" <br/><br/>While Slade is very good at establishing setting and mood, his choices in technique can be jarring. There are at least a half-dozen cuts away from (and into) action that is given no specific setting, nor any real setup (an early ""home invasion"" scene that seemingly comes out of nowhere is a good example). Also indicative of the past decade of horror is an over-reliance on chaotic, ""Saving Private Ryan""-style edits whenever a vamp attacks, which is more disorienting than exciting.<br/><br/>Now, I grant you, all of these qualms could very well be peripheral if the movie delivers on its blood-sucking baddies, but ""30 Days""' most glaring misstep (and it is pure, graphic-novel flaw) is in turning our gang of black-suited vamps into periodic philosophers who strut around like smug Goth kids with blood on their chins. Every time fang-king Marlow (Danny Huston) paused to deliver a subtitled line in his guttural vampire-language, I nearly rolled my eyes in disbelief. I kept thinking, ""You're ruining itjust suck your blood and shut up!"" The other vamps screech and howl and get the requisite ""snarling close-ups"" as they feast on some poor sucker's neck. Ho hum.<br/><br/>While Josh Hartnett and Melissa George do an admirable job of propping up their underwritten roles (they're an estranged couple, and you know the rest), their efforts, combined with Slade's eye for visuals, cannot raise ""30 Days"" to the level of a modern vampire classic. No matter how it's presented, a plot about vaguely-defined characters holing up in buildings for an indefinite period is nothing new. Which is a shame, since ""30 Days"" clearly had the potential to set a new genre benchmark.<br/><br/>5.5 out of 10"

If you want a logical explanation of why there are vampires in the world, or a resolution to their eons of persecution, go rent Stoker's Dracula. This ain't the love story that put you to sleep - I promise. I see others claiming it wasn't scary. My friends it was as scary as any movie I have ever seen. After being disappointed so many times at the box office, I am finally satisfied. In short this movie will satisfy you if you want to watch a horror. Especially a vampire horror. This is extremely well produced with a REAL budget and expertise. Raimi's best work, better than Signs and The Village put together. A 9 instead of a 10 due to the over use of the shaky camera or what I call nausea-vision. Anyway I can't recommend it highly enough, what are you waiting for - go see it - YOU WILL JUMP!"
"jcallows","7","8","14","17 February 2009"," Conventional Vampire Flick with a Few Twists
","There's nothing new about this vampire film. It's your basic vampire/zombie film about a group of townspeople making that familiar last stand with the usual bittersweet ending. But this was what we came here for, wasn't it?<br/><br/>Anyway, sure, these vampire/zombie films have been done before many times, but I'm a sucker for them and can probably see many more for years to come. Still, this film could've been done better.<br/><br/>First of all, it just took too long to see the vampires. We have to wait about 30 minutes of setup and dialog to get to them. Now, we all know this is a vampire movie and if you're gonna keep us waiting to see them, there'd better be a good reason. And there wasn't. All that waiting and listening to dialog was just to describe a background that was clear from the start and to develop characters who we ended up not caring much about anyway.<br/><br/>But once the vampires showed up, things got more interesting. Visually, anyway. Otherwise it's just the usual monsters running amok killing everyone. It was just cool to see heads being decapitated. I don't think I've ever seen so many heads being cut off in such graphic detail in one film. Pretty neat. But it could've been gorier had the wood chipper been used more. It was shown early in the film as if it was going figure prominently in the ending, but, unfortunately, it didn't.<br/><br/>The editing of this film was strange. Or perhaps it was the direction. People would just appear or disappear without much explanation. It was like in one scene someone was wondering ""what happened to so-and-so"" and in the next scene that so-and-so simply just reappeared without explanation of what happened in between. Then there was this other scene where the sheriff and his friend had to break from the group to look for another hideout. They struggled to get there as they fought vampires along the way, but they finally succeeded. And in the next scene we saw the rest of the group just appear in the new hideout. They were just sitting there calmly as if they had found safer path or had just been teleported somehow. Pretty odd.<br/><br/>The ending was a conventional vampire movie ending, but with an interesting twist.<br/><br/>As vampire movies go, despite the slow start, odd dialog, characters I didn't care much about and some strange editing choices, this film had enough gore and suspense and an interesting ending to keep me entertained."
"fwomp","7","8","14","25 October 2007"," Not For The Romantic Dracula Fan
","Looking for love from the Ol' Toothy Guy? Want desirable vampires that women can't resist? If that's your take on Dracula, you best look elsewhere. This is a true, blood-and-guts, horror film, so that's what awaits you when you pay for your cinema ticket for 30 DAYS OF NIGHT.<br/><br/>Director David Slade of HARD CANDY fame is becoming known for the psychological aspects of his films. The aforementioned Hard Candy was shockingly excellent, with the story turning the tables again and again on a pedophiliac relationship that made viewers squirm in their seats.<br/><br/>And here, again, Slade shows us that he can jump into an old legend and put a new spin on things. Vampire movies are a dime-a-dozen, most of them severely romanticizing the toothy villains. But Slade gives them no sway. In 30 Days Of Night they are brutal, strong, extremely old, and after only one thing: fresh meat to satiate their insatiable hunger.<br/><br/>The unfortunate victims of their bloodthirst is the Alaskan town of Barrow. Anyone who knows anything about geography and oil knows that Barrow is at the ""top of the world,"" cradled on the edge of the arctic ocean where the Alaskan pipeline is the dominant feature. It also means that this little shanty-ish town is well above the arctic circle, a place where the sun disappears entirely for many winter weeks. Sounds like a buffet brunch for the ancient fanged cohorts, no? I mean, they don't have to worry about the sun, and there are hundreds of these weak humans running around in the dark. What's not to love! Problems quickly become evident as Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett, LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN) runs into a sudden rash of crimes. All of the cell phones in town are discovered burned on a hillside. Every last sled dog is found murdered. The sole helicopter in town is found dismantled and destroyed. And a lone Stranger (Ben Foster, HOSTAGE) wanders into town with gloom and doom surrounding him. This Stranger runs afoul of the local constabulary and is rushed to a jail cell ...which is when things really start going downhill for the people of Barrow.<br/><br/>The last day of sun comes and goes, and a Russian ship sits idly in a hidden bay. Off this ship comes pure trouble. With no need to hide from the sun, these ancient vampires are free to roam and kill at their leisure. The people of Barrow are easy pickings.<br/><br/>During all of the ensuing chaos, Sheriff Oleson is also battling a separation from his wife Stella (Melissa George, DARK CITY), who is forced to stay in Barrow after having an unfortunate car accident. It is her, her husband, and a small band of survivors who are the final holdouts within Barrow. Discovering that the only way to kill these vampires is to behead them, the Sheriff and his shrinking townspeople are forced to do the unthinkable, sometimes to friends who have been ""turned"" into vampires.<br/><br/>The ending is a bit sappy but filmed pretty well. The psychological aspects of it are impressive considering what the Sheriff is forced to do in order to save the town and the wife he now loves again (who needs marriage counseling when you've got human-devouring bloodsuckers to worry about?) But this film isn't without its problems. From the very beginning, it is obvious that the film makers spent zero time researching how the sun sets above the arctic circle (it doesn't come straight down onto the horizon but slants into it at an extreme angle). And the sun doesn't stay up for long during the last day before it vanishes. It's probably up just a few moments before it sinks below the horizon again and is NEVER up very high in the sky.<br/><br/>The acting is so-so with Hartnett pulling in an okay lead performance. Ben Foster as ""The Stranger"" is creepily menacing and filthy, enough to send a few shivers up your spine. The vampires themselves were the most interesting, their communication often being more of a clicking sound than words, and some of them looking almost neanderthal-ish, giving them a very ancient appearance.<br/><br/>But the film is good in that it doesn't spoonfeed the audience any information. We're not exactly sure how old these vampires are, nor exactly how many are left (although it appears these are ""the last of their kind""). We're also never privy to the Sheriff and his wife's marital difficulties, it being internalized by the characters and only felt via them (which was quite refreshing ...we didn't need to know this information, only how they were going to survive for a month against these monsters).<br/><br/>This is a gore-fest, too, with plenty of crimson for the hardcore horror fan. But it doesn't go over the top. Only one beheading is truly shown and it was a powerful scene meant to shock you. And, like the movie, it's an assault on your senses. A good assault, that is."

","I saw the midnight show of this movie and although it wasn't packed I was surprised at the turnout. I did not expect to have more than 10 people show up but I would say that at least one hundred people came to see a movie about a bunch of vampires. <br/><br/>This movie was marketed as ""redefining the vampire mythos."" The graphic novel in which this movie was based certainly was groudbreaking and I must admit I agree with its proclamation. ""30 Days of Night really did a good job of staying away from the cliché vampire moments that a majority of the recent movies with vampires have followed. No kung fu fighting...which was a breath of fresh air. Far too often you find vampire movies in which all of the bloodsuckers (even newly turned ones) instantly have a 3rd degree black belt. Very frustrating... this movie does not have any of that. <br/><br/>What this movie does have are scenes that probably will not scare or shock you but they do stick with you long after you leave the theatre. I won't mention those moments obviously but you will know what I am talking about. Unless you have not read the graphic novel of course. And even if you have the movie still has scenes that were not in the graphic novel. <br/><br/>The vampires were not your traditional romantic eyed strangers that seduce their victims...Oh no. They were grotesque in their appearance, animalistic in the way they fed and they even spoke in a eery language. The villains in movies such as this either make or break it, well the villains certainly made the movie what it professes to be...""a new take on the vampire mythos."" <br/><br/>Even Josh Harnett pulled out a very good performance as the movie's hero. Not a big fan of his, but whomever casted him did a very good job. The other actors did not wow me but they didn't take anything away from the movie. The main vampire was not as scene stealing as he should have been but his ""minions"" made up for that. <br/><br/>The biggest flaw in the movie was that there were scenes in the graphic novel that should have been in the movie, key scenes but besides that, the movie was definitely one to remember. I gave this movie a high rating comparing it to other movies in its genre. I think it is right up there with ""Lost Boys and Near Dark"" as one of the best vampire tales ever. When you see it, go in there with an open mind and prepare yourself for a very entertaining, albeit gruesome, movie going experience."

It wasn't typical for a vampire movie and I can honestly say this is the best one I've watched.<br/><br/>It's a worth a watch in the movie theaters just for the fact that the loud noises really add a certain suspense element I don't think people that watch it on the internet will get.<br/><br/>so, I give this an 8/10 just because it was also original, not the typical vampire movie for a change, I recommend this to anyone who just want to see a good movie and the fun thing also is that there isn't actually much gory parts :)"

","'Slow-burning' horror films, where the audience gets to know and care about the characters before the blood starts flowing, are rare these days. So with 30 Days Of Night taking its time to get started, I thought it might turn out to be something good.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it just turned out to be slow. The characters are so sketchily drawn that despite all the time spent with them early on, you never get to find out anything interesting about them. Similarly, the '30 days' gimmick is totally wasted - probably half the film takes place on the very first night, then after that the only indication that any time has passed is an on-screen caption and the growth of Josh Hartnett's comedy beard. There's no sense at all that two weeks may have passed between scenes, no cabin fever or paranoia or people cracking up under the strain of hiding out from merciless vampiric killers. All you get are - again - sketches of scenes, leading to someone making a stupid decision to go outside and whoops, another one dead.<br/><br/>The vampires don't make much sense, either. They massacre almost the entire town on the first night, and then... what? Are they playing cards somewhere, waiting for the handful of survivors to show their faces? If they're hunting the humans for food, they're doing a sloppy and wasteful job of it. (Also, while the idea of vampires taking advantage of the perpetual night of winter above the Arctic Circle is a good one, what do they do during the summer when it's perpetual daylight? Do they sail their ship to the South Pole?)<br/><br/>Some iffy editing (there was one scene where a character appeared to be attacked by a vampire, only to reappear moments later without a scratch) and trendy-yet-hard-to-watch strobing shakycam during fight scenes didn't help either.

","In Barrow, Alaska, seventy percent of the population of five hundred and some dwellers travels on the day of the last sunset, since the town will stay along the next thirty days without sun light. Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and Deputy Billy Kitka (Manu Bennett) find many cell phones burned on the road. Then they receive a phone call from the local creator telling that his dogs have been slaughtered; later Eben finds the operator of the cell tower decapitated. He arrests a troublemaker drifter (Ben Foster) and the stranger frightens him telling that ""they are coming and the locals will be dead"". Sooner Eben discovers that the town is under siege and attacked by a gang of bloodthirsty vampires, and together with a few survivors, they hide in a empty cellar expecting for the next sunrise.<br/><br/>""30 Days of Night"" has a promising idea, reasonable beginning and development but a disappointing conclusion. The stupid decision of Sheriff Eben, injecting the contaminated blood to fight the leader of the vampires, is one of the most ridiculous situations I have ever seen in a movie. The guy transforms himself into a vampire, and after a fight where he is beat-up, he destroys the evil leader. Then the other vampires simply leave the spot and a few minutes later the sun rises. But the hideout where Stella was has not been destroyed by the fire and the vampires had not noted her presence. Therefore his attitude was absolutely unnecessary – he should only wait for a couple of minutes to save the whole team; further, how could the gang of vampires survive to the sun light if they burned the whole town? Why didn't they leave Barrow before? Why did they kill most of the inhabitants in the very beginning in bloodshed if they should stay for thirty days in the town and the dwellers were stranded, with no place to go? The strength and the speed of the vampires in the beginning of the story are also very silly. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""30 Dias de Noite"" (""30 Days of Night"")<br/><br/>Note: On 15 Sep 2017 I saw this film again on Blu-Ray and I liked more. (my vote was seven despite the flaws)."

","This is the story of an isolated Alaskan town that is plunged into darkness for a month each year when the sun sinks below the horizon. As the last rays of light fade, the town is attacked by a bloodthirsty gang of vampires bent on an uninterrupted orgy of destruction. Only the small town's husband-and-wife Sheriff team stand between the survivors and certain destruction.<br/><br/>No, I'm not a fan of the comic book(s) and yes, I'm a fan of David Slade's previous movie, ""Hard Candy"". So was this a film as good as ""Hard Candy""? Certainly not. But this film is better than most movies with this genre (AKA vampire movies).<br/><br/>What I think might disappoint fans is the slow beginning.Like usual horror movies, there always come a bloody prologue resulting to kills and gore. Well, this one does not. Instead, literally nothing happens in about 40 minutes, if you exclude the random scenes of animal and human kills.<br/><br/>I like the set up and the slow beginning obviously wants you to get to know the characters but what you get is no less than other horror movies that start off the violence right away. So yes, I think that might disappoint horror fans out there.<br/><br/>What's after that is your usual bloody kills, chases with the shaky cam, and some decent plot themes. What I like most from the movie is the cinematography and the look/effects of the film. This film looks beautiful. It makes Alaska look beautiful.<br/><br/>What I also like are the scenes that had some tension. There are little but that's better than most horror movies I've seen because I seem to never get scared of anything. The performances by the actors/actresses are decent but nothing special.<br/><br/>What I find annoying is that the movie takes place over 30 days, or nights. So if you're watching the film and when 40 minutes passed with ""Day 7"" on the bottom of the screen, it will mostly cause you to make a huge sigh. When another 30 minutes pass and says ""Day 17"" on the bottom screen, you might look at your watch. Yes, these things annoy me because it makes the movie feel slow. Just to remind you, this is about two hours long. Maybe they should've gone with ""12 Hours of Night""? Yes, there is lots of blood. Yes, the violence is relentless (some kills are off screen, though). And yes, the ending is so similar to one other vampire movie that I will not say, which is encouraging and depressing, I suppose. Horror fans might be disappointed with the slow beginning but will love the remaining parts of the movie. I just thought it was your above-average vampire movie, which doesn't mean that much."

","Top be honest this was one of the better Vamp flicks I've seen, the vampires had an awesome look to them and really seemed more like monsters rather then made to look ""stylish"". If I had one complaint, they sort of were a bit ""overacted"", if that is even a real term. Too much ""lets look at each other and howl"" or move our mouths in funny ways I guess, I don't really know where I'm going with this but for some reason or another it got a little old/ goofy and got more laughs from the audience then anything. Blank stares or shadowed faces would have been more creepy then showing everything up front.I would say this is a mix of elements from 28 Days Later and some from Pitch Black, and while far better then the later (IMO), its just not as good as the former. There was a decent amount of good moments, but I can't really say it was one of the scarier movies I've seen. I had fun,but it also seemed to drag in some parts. I'll rate it a 8/10 for vampire horror flicks, but overall it would probably be more of a 6, so I just rounded it to the middle of those."
"LayerCake","4","18","40","20 October 2007"," 30 days of moving
","30 Days of Night was horrible. One of the worst films over the year. I had high hopes for it, I mean Hard Candy's David Slade was directing, how could it have gone wrong? Simple. It was pointless and flawed in almost every aspect. If it wasn't for the good photography and camera angles then this film would've joined Captivity and Intervention as my only 1/10 films for 2007.<br/><br/>30 Days starts off by telling you facts about Barrow, Alaska, how it's the northernmost city in Alaska and how once each year it is plunged into 30 days of night. Slade introduces you to the character's and tries to show you how each of them flawed in a certain way to make you have feelings for them, although whenever someone died I felt no remorse what so ever, in fact, if I could have, I would've started to sing Another One Bites the Dust in the middle of the theater.<br/><br/>The thing I was most surprised by the though, was how shitty the script was. It was written by Steve Niles (The man behind the graphic novel), Brian Nelson (Hard Candy), and Stuart Beattie (Collateral). 30 Days had numerous scenes of corny lines and irrelevant dialog. The reason for the name of my review is because every time a new time card popped up Josh Hartnett would be the first to talk, and every damn time he did he'd say, ""We need to move."" By the end of the film they had moved at least 4 times I'm pretty sure.<br/><br/>Most people who liked the film were using the defense that it was a.) really gory or b.) super scary. I can now wrong them. My response to 'a' is yes, it did have lots of gore, some of it was cool, but really, does gore make a movie a 7/10? My conclusion to 'b' is great I think, plain and simple the film wasn't scary at all. There's no sense of isolation because most of the characters walk around an attic making tons of noise while the vampires are supposed to be walking along the roofs. If they're so superior wouldn't they have an increased sense of hearing? I will compliment the film on one other note however, they did do a good job of making vampires look undead for once. The teeth and the eyes helped increase the intensity of some of the scenes, still though that's not enough to save a film. Save your money for this one.<br/><br/>I give it a 4/10"
"tburke85","7","5","8","18 May 2009"," 30 Days Of Night A Decent Horror Thriller
","30 Days Of Night is a decent horror thriller with an interesting premise. The whole cast do an admirable job in their roles including Josh Hartnett as Sheriff Eben Olsen, Melissa George as his wife Stella Olsen, Danny Huston as the ruthless vampire leader Marlow, and Ben Foster in a small role as a mysterious stranger. Hartnett and George do a good job as the leads of the film desperately trying to survive the onslaught unleashed by bloodthirsty vampires in an Alaskan town where there are thirty days of night. A perfect place for these kind of creatures if they could ever exist anyway. Huston makes for a menacing Marlow. His role couldn't been bigger considering Huston doesn't show up as Marlow for a while and he doesn't have that much dialogue either. But Huston makes the best of the role he does have as the sadistic vampire leader. The same can go for Foster whose especially creepy as The Stranger but unfortunately his part in the movie is cut short. From the action which is pretty much non-stop, to the suspense and horror, 30 Days Of Night is an above average vampire movie with just enough bite, blood, and suspense that does have some flaws but the movie over all is an entertaining horror thriller. If you're a fan of these sort of films then I'm sure you'll enjoy this one as well."
"Uriah43","7","3","4","1 October 2012"," A Good, Action-Packed Horror Movie
","There are several good things about this film that differentiates it from the average vampire story line. The idea of using a small, Arctic town like Barrow, Alaska, creates all kinds of unique opportunities that most movies of this genre don't have available to them. For example, because of its geographic location it has ""30 days of night"" which gives the vampires a totally new lethal capability as they now have 24 hours in a day to wreck havoc. And they take maximum advantage of this new opportunity. Additionally, the extreme winter environment and the geographic isolation provide a new set of difficulties for the humans in their desperate attempt to stay alive. Another difference is the ugliness of these vampires and their behavior which is much more savage than most ""typical"" vampires presented in films today. They enjoy tormenting their prey. As far as the film is concerned, it was nominated in 2008 for a Saturn Award for ""Best Horror Film"" along with ""Best Makeup"". It boasts plenty of action but this detracts a bit from the overall acting performances. While both Josh Hartnett (playing the lead character of Sheriff ""Eben Oleson"") and Melissa George (playing his estranged wife ""Stella Oleson"") performed adequately, the rest of the characters weren't well-developed and it showed. All in all though, this was a good, action-packed horror movie that makes good use of the dark ambiance and original concepts."
"dominicpearson","6","3","4","4 April 2010"," Worth a watch
","As ever, I would like to be able to use .5 markings on IMDb but to no avail! Whilst I have rated this 6 it is going to be closer to a 6.5 if I am honest. Not the type of 6.5 to rate it as a 7 though (see the problem?) I like this film. I do. It gripped me and pulled me in. I like the premise (although I agree it is nothing too original). I am a fan of vampire films/stories in general. So why not a higher score?? Well, let me begin...<br/><br/>The first 40 minutes was great. The set up drew me in, the slow reveal of the vampires wrenched up the tension and the unfolding panic and destruction was dealt with brilliantly.<br/><br/>The overhead shot of the town being over run with its contrast between white, white snow and blood red, er, blood was a beautiful but harrowing scene. The look of terror and realisation on the face of the townsfolk as this was going on was also well caught.<br/><br/>But then the film turns. Its set up is lost in an hour of nothingness. OK, I get it - they are striving to survive. I get that they have to be quiet. So why do they, one by one, randomly start running about trying to take on the vampires??? There is not a great deal of logic other than to eek out the tension and action a little bit more. 20 minutes could easily have been shaved off the film. A lot of the middle portion was redundant and repetitious.<br/><br/>Another problem I had was Josh Hartnett. I do not think I have seen a film of his yet that I have thought ""wow, what a great actor"". He is wooden throughout this film and I have no empathy for him at all. I think this is, in part, down to the lack of backstory but he is just not believable as an actor. If I were looking for like to like characters in similar films I would compare him to Cillian Murphys character in 28 Days Later. The only difference is Cillian Murphy played the character with real depth. You felt he understood the predicament, the threat to the lives of those he was protecting. I got none of that with Josh Hartnett. Still, better than 40 Days and 40 Nights (dreadful film!!).<br/><br/>The supporting cast really had no stories at all. We did not get to know them or care about them. They were there only as fodder for the vampires. Great, but when they are central to the dilemma the main character faces at the end of the film you want to feel some empathy for the choice he has to make.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the conclusion. I really don't get why, after beating the head vampire, the others would just run away. It makes no sense. He was just one relatively new and weak vamp against a whole gang. They could have ripped him to pieces and found the rest quite easily.<br/><br/>So lets conclude.<br/><br/>The Good - Brilliantly shot and for the first half tensely directed and performed vampire flick with a difference. Plenty of blood and gore which always helps a horror film and I like the make up jobs on the vamps.<br/><br/>The Bad - Josh Hartnett. And a second act that dragged far too long. Add to that an ending that did not really make much sense and you have disappointments running throughout the film There are much better vampire films out there. This is an average attempt but if you can look past the wooden performances and dragging plot its worth a watch!"

","I thought this would be just another horror zombie flick but as it turns out, it was actually quite a good movie. Yes, we've all seen the plot before but the 30 days without sun scenario actually gave the movie a big part of its realism. I get crazy enough during the short winter days so I can't imagine what your mind does to you if you don't see the sun for a whole month. The action is real and the survivors don't go to any extraordinary means to stay alive, they just used good old-fashioned group work. There were some good performance from the lead and it was nice to see Josh Harnett isn't just another pretty Hollywood face. The ending has a real nice melancholic twist to it."

","Allot better than I thought. Had some pretty scary scenes in there from time to time. Sorta took the 28 days later feel with the quick attacking zombies that come out of nowhere. Which I like. Those old movies with these blood craving Zombies walking along at 1 mph, while the victims always seem to fall down and lay there till the monster gets them, always seem fake and stupid. At least here, you feel general fear with putting yourself in these peoples places. Acting was pretty good. Good scary feeling with this nighttime/cold snowy feel to the movie. If I had to have a grief, its the same with allot of movies- the ending. More realistic way to end the movie was to have these zombies realize the sun is finally rising, but have Hartnett stop them from going into hiding, or wherever they came from. But, I can deal with that. 90 percent of the movie is a good solid scare-gore fest.."
"petra_ste","6","3","4","9 February 2008"," Good story, bad plot
","There is much to like about David Slade's 30 Days of Night: a fairly clever horror concept (based on a graphic novel), compelling atmosphere, creepy villains. Unfortunately, a few flaws prevent this from becoming a cult classic.<br/><br/>The premise is nifty: vampires attack an isolated town in Alaska at the beginning of its month-long period of darkness. A few survivors, including Sheriff Eben (a solid Josh Hartnett) and his ex-wife Stella (lovely Melissa George), try to survive until the sunrise.<br/><br/>Character development is weak. Apart for Eben and Stella, survivors are nondescript, so it's difficult to care about them. It's a pity some interesting individuals, like Foster's Renfield-like stranger or Boone's mountain man, are not given more to do.<br/><br/>Plot developments feel jarring and arbitrary. Survivors sneak around whispering, constantly hiding from the supposedly looming threat of the monsters; sometimes, when a character takes as much as one step outside, he is doomed... then we repeatedly see scenes of Eben & Co. walking down the streets to gather supplies, change hiding place, and nothing happens. It creates a weird disconnect.<br/><br/>At least these vampires are effective villains: nasty, beast-like, with razor-sharp teeth and claws, a sinister guttural language. Danny Huston gives a surprisingly creepy performance as their leader. <br/><br/>6,5/10"
"twisted_cherub","8","3","4","31 October 2007"," Very Pleased
","As a fan of Josh Hartnett, I was a little sad to hear that he chose a vampire movie for his return to cinema. However, once I'd seen the trailer and watched 30 Days of Night: Blood Trails, I had high hopes. I must say I was not disappointed. I'm an avid horror movie fan (my DVDs are shelved according to zombies, vampires, aliens, werewolves, and misc. monsters) but I don't necessarily enjoy gore. I like my movies to have an excellent plot which has the minimum blood and violence needed to support it. Anyone who enjoys only open chest cavities and entrails (like my boyfriend) may not be impressed with 30 Days of Night.<br/><br/>The story is pretty original, although many of the characters are a bit cliché. There's a very predictable love story in the forefront between Eben (Hartnett) and his wife. But the brilliance is in the subtlety of the vampires, who are mostly seen as lurking shadows, and the focus on the human aspect. The plot is in the terror and hopelessness of the town's people. Settings are suffocatingly small, often with no escape route available just like Barrow itself. The reactions of most characters are believable. When the vampires are in full view they're not romanticized, as in most movies of this genre, but shown as animalistic, soulless monsters. They even kill their own rather than help them. As for the ending, I didn't see it coming.<br/><br/>Blood and guts fans will enjoy 30 Days of Night more than Interview with the Vampire. Plot junkies like me will like it more than Fright Night."

The sheriff's soon to be ex-wife Stella (Melissa George) finds herself stuck in this village as well. Now very strange things are starting to happen, when the villagers are getting attacked from the unknown. This stranger brings this eerie group of people.

They will not stop attacking until the whole villagers are dead. Now Eben, Stella and a small group of survivors try to hold on from hiding and fighting these unstoppable vampires until the sunlight comes back.<br/><br/>Directed by David Slade (Hard Candy) made an extremely well-acted, well directed Horror movie with a few genuine moments of suspense and terror. Slade's visual style is the highlight of this film, which it's based on a graphic comic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith. Slade certainly echoes some of the style of the earlier films of John Carpenter. Even Mark Boone Junior, who had a small role as Vampire Slayer in the underrated Carpenter film ""Vampires"". The Vampires certainly has a presence in this, especially Danny Huston as ""Marlow"". Perphas the problems with ""30 Days of Night"" is probably not what some audiences or critics were expecting to be. I felt the script, could have been much better in places. But there's enough character development from the human characters and the vampires are kept mysterious enough in the film.<br/><br/>Sadly, this horror movie was an box office disappointment. The reviews were certainly mixed, although ""30 Days of Well"" is possibly one of the most well received horror movie of this year by certain critics. The conclusion is certainly familiar to ""Blade 2"". There's also a few (unintentionally ?) laughs as well but there's strong moments of violence, gory and a few jolts as well. The production designs by Paul D. Austerberry (Resident Evil:Apocalyspe, Assault on Precient 13 ""2005"", Highwaymen) and the widescreen cinematography by Jo Williems are first-rate. I think, it's one of those films will be a cult favorite once it's release on DVD. It's one of the strongest ""Vampire"" movies in a while but certainly not one of the best in the genre. It's one of those movies that certainly looks good in the Big Screen. It's worth viewing. Screenplay by Niles, Staurt Beattie (Collateral, Derailed) and Brian Nelson. Super 35. (*** ½/*****)."

Graphic, very full of blood and gore and enough raw violence to satisfy any horror movie goer, but nothing that isn't predictable. If you are a fan of vampire movies, there are some aspects one can see pulled out from other movies. (But since this was a graphic novel that was probably the artist's doing.) There are many unrealistic plot holes as well, that throw the watcher back into reality to go, ""wait, what?""

"invisiblespike","7","4","6","19 March 2010"," A horror flick that actually went quite well? Is it a dream? No it's 30 Days of NIght
","Your initial thoughts on this film might consider it a mindless blood fest with little or no point, along the lines of Rambo but when you seriously watch this film you realise what it's really got going for it. Now, make no mistake there WILL be blood, not to mention bone, gristle and every other part of the fragile human anatomy. This film could be described as a horror flick but I'd put it more as an action although there are some undeniably spine tingling moments.<br/><br/>The plot centres around the residents of Barrow, Alaska which is the northernmost town in the United States. Now living in Barrow has the interesting (or in this case unfortunate)side effect of having a month of perpetual darkness and news of this has reached a rather pale and unhealthy fellow named Marlowe (Danny Huston). Marlowe and his disciples it turns out are vampires and they're more or less looking at Barrow as an all you can eat buffet.<br/><br/>One performance I enjoyed very much was that of a seemingly addle brained man called the Stranger (Ben Foster). For the first fifteen minutes the Stranger roams around butchering sled dogs and basically making the vampires jobs easier until he is nicked by Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett). He's struck some sort of pact with Marlowe and Co, if he helps them butcher ever poor sod left in Barrow he'll get to become a vampire to. Well Marlowe goes back on his pact and kills him.<br/><br/>One sequence that was particularly creepy was when the remaining survivors are hiding out in an attic and a vampire catches their scent. He wanders into the house. Due to the hidden nature of the attic he is unable to find them but it makes for edge of your seat viewing. Another great sequence is when practically the entire gang of vampires are attacked by the local snowplough driver Beau (Mark Boone Jr) and he proceeds to carve several of them up with the snowplough before using road flares and dynamite to blow a few more to kingdom come, taking him with them. Unfortunately it doesn't quite go to plan. Several vampires are incinerated by the blast but Beau survives until a royally hacked off Marlowe gets a hold of him.<br/><br/>One thing that stood out was the image of the vampires. There's none of this new age Twilight crap but there's also none of the Industrial Revolution Dracula look. These vampires are pretty much grotesque with pale skin, distinctly uncomfortable looking fingernails (or claws as is more accurate) and serious issues with dental hygiene. Of course they are covered in blood most of the time and they certainly look menacing enough but the majority of the vampires are somewhat two dimensional.<br/><br/>Another criticism to make is the seriously misguided casting of Melissa George as Eben's estranged wide Stella. Now I'm sorry but she can't act and her looks of terror when confronted with the pale and ghoulish vampires come across as amateurish, second rate and above all transparent. In fact the only purpose Georges casting serves is to distract from the uninspired choice of Hartnett as the leading man. Neither actor is really making go of it and I feel that drags the film down.<br/><br/>It is my opinion that it is the direction by David Slade that salvages the film, the way he cranks up the tension and films the action scenes with breathtaking skill and scope. One shot gives an eagle eye view of the town panning across bloodstained snows and showing vampires brutalising the poor townsfolk with only screams, growls and the occasional shotgun blast for sound. While we're at it the vampires speaking not in English but a guttural tongue that is subtitled is better because I couldn't see English coming out of those mouths with the fangs in the way.<br/><br/>On the acting front it was Huston and Foster that salvage the film, Huston in particular playing the low key menace and sadistic pleasure to the hilt and resiting the temptation to overact the part that so many vampire actors have done before cough Robert Pattinson cough! The calm and detached way Marlowe directs the transformation of Barrow from winter wonderland to slaughterhouse is truly inspired and his calm manner as opposed to his rampaging, bloodthirsty cronies are what makes this film.<br/><br/>All in all, it's no movie milestone, not by a long chalk but for those who enjoy a good horror flick but want to see some quality acting and film work, this is the film for you. Though maybe not if you're a dog lover or have a weak stomach."

At this stage, I'm annoyed, my hopes for a decent horror are shattered as the townsfolk queue up to be eaten alive. It turns into a zombie film with sharp teeth and pointy nails.

The rest is the same as any zombie film, something goes wrong and almost all the remaining survivors get gobbled.<br/><br/>Of course, if you like generic zombie movies, then there wont be a problem, but i was expecting more. For a horror it isn't scary enough. It has tense moments but the characters are so shallow that i just didn't care. It isn't disturbing, it IS dark but its NOT intelligent.

The film, which started great and admittedly had good cinematography fell so quickly into stupid cliché's that I could not help but roll my eyes. I know they were simply following the ""groundbreaking"" graphic novel, I guess my real question is what is so groundbreaking about a story filled with every vampire cliché there is. With enough stupid good guys to sate anyones bloodlust. (the idiots wait for 26 of the 30 days and then attempt to go ""fight"" the vampires) Even worse is the acting, which, when they finally get away from the ridiculous excessive blood is so awful that it makes me wish the good guys would hurry up and die. Yes this movie somehow manages to be SLOW to the point where i was BORED by the end of it. Those who hail this as a modern classic are LIEING to you... This movie is a gorefest without even a single scare. Perhaps 12 year old girls would find this movie frightening but i have trouble imagining anyone else releasing even a shiver were it not from laughter.<br/><br/>*HUGE SPOILER* This should convince you not to go...<br/><br/>Yes the graphic novels ending was absolutely RETARDED! Josh Hartnett infects himself with vampirism to safe his idiot girlfriend who ran off to go help some kid we NEVER saw before and so Hartnett the hero goes to confront the lead vampire... gets his ass kicked for about 10 minutes before dispatching the leader with a single punch through the head.

I was not the only one there who felt this way. But once again I digress; I just mention this because this fact, which was not the movie's fault, might have affected my enjoyment a tad.<br/><br/>Anyway, here's the good:<br/><br/>* Josh Hartnet as Eben <br/><br/>* Supporting cast, mostly. Eben's brother, decent actor; Eben's wife is hot; the Grizzly Bear Smith character (not sure the character's name but you'll know who I mean) was pretty good. Overall, acting was acceptably good.<br/><br/>* Special effects, especially the gore, were all pretty good. The gore was very realistic. Too realistic? Maybe. But it *is* a horror flick<br/><br/>* Concept, vampires in an endless night, was new. I think? I haven't seen quite exactly that setup in a vampire flick before. Kudos.<br/><br/>* Production, delivery, filming, all decent to good<br/><br/>And the bad<br/><br/>* It really didn't do anything new as far as horror movies go. As in, there were plenty of horror movie clichés.<br/><br/>* It didn't do anything new as far as vampire movies go. Standard vampire clichés as well.<br/><br/>* Quite a few typical Hollywood holes. Such as, why can't planes come in when it is dark? I mean, 30 days of dark does not have to mean 30 days of no plane flights, does it? I've flown at night, people! And, dark all the time in winter in Alaska means IT'S FORTY BELOW ZERO ALL THE FRICKIN' TIME! Put a hat on! But no, we are actors, we can be in the cold with minimal cold weather gear. And, so, they are hiding in an attic, WITH WINDOWS, and although, yes, there is a covering over the window, please, people, turn out your light!<br/><br/>I dunno, it's little things like closing up these holes that make an unbelievable scenario -- and vampires is pretty much always always an unbelievable scenario -- believable. Make the tiny things realistic and believable and it is easier to believe the outlandish stuff.<br/><br/>But overall, an alright movie.

","To understand my analogy you have to understand first what 300 was to action movies. It was beautiful to look at if relatively comic bookish, full of action, some powerful moments, but overall a relatively nonexistent storyline and minimal character development. 30 Days of Night is much the same animal.<br/><br/>The directing is nice. There are some great shots, some really intense sequences, and minimal cheesy horror clichés. The whole film has a bit of an overproduced feel, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's very much like 300 or Sin City in that respect. It feels and looks very much like an action/horror comic book.<br/><br/>I went into the movie without any real expectations and when I came out I didn't exactly feel let down, but I didn't feel like I had just watched something very great either. The most I could give an honest inquirer would be a big shrug. It was kind of a mix between 300 and Dawn of the Dead, 300 because of the overproduced comic-book atmosphere and the lack of a moving plot, and Dawn of the Dead because of the dark content and the gore.<br/><br/>I can't help but feel like something is missing from this movie to make it really great, and I now believe that quality is realism. It all felt a bit like a long Spawn cartoon or something of the like. It was fun to watch and it looked nice, but it just didn't resonate. Perhaps that was the lack of character development, but to be fair, there are some really cool moments in the movie and I do recommend seeing it in theaters if you can so you can judge for yourself.<br/><br/>If you like horror movies, check this one out, maybe you'll feel like they got it exactly right."
"sackjigler","6","8","16","20 October 2007"," I will keep this fairly simple
","There are few things that really stand out in this movie that I would consider a revamp (no pun intended) of the vampire horror film. However, this film would absolutely be a run of the mill horror vampire flick if not for a few contributing factors. First and foremost, the direction and cinematography were superb. It was very well shot. The Alaska backdrop just looks great on film and I commend David Slade for the atmosphere he brought into this film. Second, the acting was much better than most of these types of films. The vampires are brutal and played brutal. Josh Hartnett, in my opinion, played his part to perfection. Melissa George was great, as well as the rest of the cast. No one really hit a sour note with me. The gore in this film is awesome. I'm guessing that due to the dark setting of the film, the cgi wasn't blatantly obvious. There were some really great death scenes that are worth the price of admission. The bad is what most people have been saying. They go to quickly through the days and you would kinda like to know how they survived those days not shown. The experience isn't really much new and I definitely could have done without the vampires shrieking all the time. The ending will divide people, but im guessing that most will lean to the side of dislike. Overall a pretty good film. Id say it's worth a look."
"The_Void","7","10","22","8 November 2007"," Could have been better, but still a good modern vampire flick
","30 Days of Night is based on a comic book by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith which, like every other comic book, I haven't read. It's not hard to see why they'd turn this comic into a movie, however, as the chance for a brilliant vampire flick is clearly there; we've got a snow setting, coupled with one of nature's strangest happenings, and of course a pack of hungry vampires. Considering all these elements; it really does have to be said that 30 Days of Night is a big let down. While certainly not a bad film; it probably could have been a masterpiece. The plot centres on a small Alaskan town. Most people that live there are deserting; not wanting to have to withstand the upcoming month of darkness. Those that remain soon find that the fact that alcohol is banned during this time isn't there only problem; as the local sheriff notices a few strange crime reports, and pretty soon the town is at the mercy of a gang of bloodthirsty vampires, hell-bent on chowing down on everyone left in the town, before eradicating any trace of them being there. Only a small few stand in the vampires' way...<br/><br/>One of the main problems with modern horror movies is flashy photography. I don't know who decided that not letting the audience see what is going on properly is exciting, but whoever it was should be hunted down and butchered by a gang of bloodthirsty vampires, being sure to remove to his head to prevent him coming back and inventing some other rubbish. Credit where credit is due, however; this film doesn't feature too much of it. Once the vampires are introduced properly, things improve greatly and the film reaches its biggest high towards the middle with an excellent massacre sequence. From there, it's somewhat reminiscent of George Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead, as we watch the survivor's hole up and band together against the impending threat. The film stars Josh Hartnett, who is not as misplaced in the lead role as I thought he might be. He's a bit too pretty to be the town sheriff really, but he gets into his role well. Danny Huston as the head vampire is the real standout here. One big problem with the film is that it takes place over thirty days, yet it feels like it could have happened in one night. It's obvious why they chose to do it like this...but it doesn't feel right. It boils down to a disappointing and silly ending, but most of the film is entertaining and gory enough to please most viewers. Overall, this is not as great as it could have been; but it's an above average horror film, and I recommend seeing it."
"Quinoa1984","6","7","14","20 October 2007"," can a vampire flick be occasionally interesting, usually OK, and sometimes really illogical? 30 Days of Night is all that
","30 Days of Night might be a lot better in the form of a comic-book (never read it, heard many great things), but as a film it's derivative and original, really stupid (mostly towards the end) and with some solid thrills in both the classic and neo-forms. David Slade and his crew do an excellent job at creating a little Alaskan community surrounded by the ominous cold and snow, no argument there. It is something to see the baron streets like out of some ghost town in a western painted with splatter spots of blood, and then the shadows of these pesky vampires coming around the bend to catch their victims. And sometimes he and his director of photography get creative in a good way: I liked the over-head shot that looms above a scene of carnage, probably as something closest to the style of a comic book of this variety. It's also cool to see how Slade tries to emphasize the importance of the background, how even if it's all out of focus what you need to look out for what you don't expect to see, which will pounce and tear you to ribbons. This side is worth looking for in 30 Days of Night.<br/><br/>But there are problems. I can see how there is already a surge of 'fan-boys' for this movie, as it appeals to a chilling aesthetic if one hasn't seen many vampire movies before. I can also see how people hated it even more than me- it is trashy in the sense that it doesn't stop to make any logic out of how the vampires even get to the location by some wandering madman (Ben Foster, should be the performance to garner him an Oscar- for overracting that is- following his actual terrifying part in 3:10 to Yuma) across miles and miles of endless terrain from some foreign land. But in its own way it's a decent B-movie, loaded with some better budgeted effects and production design, as it lowers its sights into being a survival tale without too much pretense. This being said, it's hard not to look at how Slade and company make the vampires, how they move and attack and eat like they're the infected in the 28 Days Later movies, but at the same time still sort of generic when it comes time for their close-ups and one-on-one time, including having a leader of sorts, going back to the Blade series. And while it might be a little harder to make the connection, I can't look at bloody snow dogs in the snowy wilderness without thinking of the Thing- particularly the scene where they're most prominent.<br/><br/>At the least, it stays conventionally pleasant, or gruesome, as it needs to be- it's predictable to a fault, but until the last five to ten minutes comfortably so: we got the hero (Hartnett, who is OK in the role, but is better as a garnish ala Sin City), the tough girl, the big guy who has all the chops to take the buggers on, the young sprout teen who wants to prove himself, the naiive old folk, and Foster as the crazy guy...But then that ending, which makes any logical flaws beforehand look irrelevant in comparison. Hartnett, in an attempt to stop the vampires from getting the lead female, who's hiding under a car, amid a huge blaze set all across town the vampires set up, injects himself with a deceased vampire's blood, becomes one in part, and then goes out to fight the main bad-ass vampire leader. There's sections I could go on and on about this, from the factor of the fire to the other vampires just standing around not doing anything while there's a big meant-to-be-romantic fight to the un-death, to why they all left the convinience store in the first place. But it all comes off as unbelievable, even for a horror movie, and I couldn't help but laughing out loud as suddenly Hartnett comes back to win the day through a ridiculously gruesome manner. It's one of the worst endings I've seen in a movie this year, and almost left me with a worse taste in my mouth from what was previously an alright entry in the Sam Raimi-produced horror-for-kids of the moment."

","What the heck. I want those precious minutes of my life back. This is the first movie to actually prompt me to write a review here. That's how bad it was.<br/><br/>I had such high hopes for this movie. Such very very high hopes. As the summary says, they were completely dashed to pieces.<br/><br/>Goodness, I don't even know where to begin. I suppose the biggest thing was the bizarre passing of time. There were little things that popped up to say ""11 days passed"" or whatever, but within the movie, nothing seemed to change. Eban sort of grew a bit of a beard, but that was about it. It didn't even look like it was 30 days' worth of growth. No one's hair got longer or anything like that, and apparently they went all 30 days without showering or changing their clothes. If the vampires could smell their blood, couldn't they smell their nasty unwashed month-old bodies? How would it be possible to hide with so much person-funk all cooped up in the same space? And what did the people eat for that matter while they were all hiding out? Really, it looked like the film was shot to take place over the course of two days and then the editor looked at the script and saw that it was, in fact, THIRTY days of night and then swore to himself and stuck some tags in to say that eleven or eighteen or whatever days have passed. Clearly, however, the characters have not been stuck in the police station for a week, because they're all dressed completely the same and only sitting in different positions. Realistically, someone would have gone nuts in that space of time, just sitting cooped up with six other smelly people, not just sat quietly and waited.<br/><br/>Now let's discuss the vampires themselves. Why... WHY... do they need to scream so much? Constant, unending ""unearthly"" screams. Stop, please, for the love of god. And the constant jerky bird-like head movements, the constant blood-beards that they never even attempted to wash off... THEY WORE CLOTHES. Clearly they were human enough to do that. If they were human enough to wear clothes, then they should have been human enough to wipe off their faces SOMEWHERE in the course of the supposed thirty days instead of just dripping everywhere.<br/><br/>And the child vampire? Really? ""I'm through playing with this one now. Do you want to play with me?"" Could we please get a little more clichéd? I could go on for pages, but I've already wasted enough time on this movie. Suffice it to say that I want to punch someone, it was so awful."

","Many cirtics are giving this movie one , one and a half, or two. But this movie really deserves three or four, that's how good this movie is. It had scary music to give the chills, the unsuspecting kill that the Vampires kill to give suspense, and great gore for the deaths. This is a simple movie about a town that are getting killed by Vampires, but for 30 days of night. As the days go by one by one the survives die and I love the scary music to go with them dying. I haven't seen a good vampire movie since John Carpenter's Vampires. If you think the graphic novel is gory and exciting, wait till you watch it. The only thing wrong about this movie was the ending. First I wish the vampire fight was longer and he killed more of those vampires. Second is I think everyone should have died. Not four survives, and the way the died was sad but I was hoping the ending that since he kissed her wife before he died she should have turned into one for the sequel.Lastly if you were in the movie theater there were subtitles that were distracting. Again, a great,gory, suspenseful movie and I know this movie shall do well because of the director. I have to loved this movie because this was a dark version of what if Vampires existed. The cast was great, loved kills, this is the best Vampire movie because of Sam Raimi. Give this guy a big hand. This movie needs to have 9/10, keep making movies like these."
"PoisonKeyblade","10","5","9","26 October 2007"," One of the best of 2007!!
","Horror reaches all-new heights and temperatures in the Arctic vampire flick 30 Days of Night, a film which made 16 million dollars and was first in the box office during week one of release. Directed by David Slade of last year's underground thriller Hard Candy, 30 Days of Night gives a new name to vampire films with its slick acting and directing, stunning special effects, insane action, gallons of blood and gore, and intensely terrifying sequences. 30 Days of Night stars Josh Hartnett and Melissa George, and is based upon the graphic novel of the same name.<br/><br/>After being plunged into darkness for an entire month, an Alaskan town is attacked by dark creatures that feed on human blood. Desperate to survive and without phones or any way of communicating, Sheriff Eben (Josh Hartnett), Stella (Melissa George), and a select few other survivors fight for their life against bloodthirsty vampires and try to make it through 30 days of pure darkness.<br/><br/>Director David Slade utilizes beautiful cinematography along with the stunning surroundings of Alaska and snowy winds. All of the violent and gruesome scenes are not just nasty, but they flow with the story and make for amazing visuals. The CGI that is used in a few scenes is barely noticeable, and the brutality will, at times, leave your mouth agape. Slade brings a nice flow and great pacing, although sometimes it can be uneven, and gets some great performances out of the actors.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett, surprisingly enough, plays a completely out of control character for once, and he really shines in the role. His character has a lot of depth and goes through important changes through the film. Melissa George may not have been the better half, but she made the relationship between Eben and Stella pretty believable. Her character might be hollow, but she brings quite a lot of charisma and a great personality to her character. Ben Foster, undoubtedly, serves up the best performance in the movie as the terrifying and mysterious Stranger. With his limited screen time, he manages to bring in a creative accent and a grimy and unique look and feel to a rather bland character. He gets some of the best dialogue in the movie.<br/><br/>Unpredictable for the most part, 30 Days of Night moves at an insanely fast pace and felt a lot like 28 Weeks Later for the vampire lover. One of the best horror movies of 2007, 30 Days of Night should not be missed for its unique performances, non-stop action, shocking scenes, great score, and a very creative direction from David Slade.

"jeff_bennion","10","5","9","22 October 2007"," It's about time
","It's about time a good horror movie came out. Lately, gore has been used as a substitute for plot (see: Saw, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, House of 100 Corpses, etc.). Not to say that those movies didn't have a plot (I enjoyed those movies), but the gore was just so overpowering that it consumed the weaker plot. This movie is also gory, but the plot and the suspense is also good, so you walk out of the theater with a good impression of an excellent movie, not a vomiting sensation. I love vampire/zombie movies, so this review might be a little tainted by that. I also watched a lot of horror movies as a kid. I knew that this movie was going to be good as soon as I saw the preview. It's got the right amount of startling suspense, special effects, plot, and character development. The other thing I liked was that the special effects weren't overdone. As far as special effects go, you have fake teeth, some makeup, and some mutilated bodies. Nothing looks fake or cgi, so I was impressed with that aspect. There were some moments that I didn't understand, like why some people couldn't drive away fast enough from the vampires, but others could run or walk away from them. (Update: I checked out the graphic novels and they explain it there - it's because of the cold). But, in general, it was an excellent movie and I would watch it again in heartbeat and will definitely buy it on blue-ray when it comes out."

","A dark and nasty force descends on the isolated town of Barrow, Alaska, in the movie 30 Days of Night, and if you thought it was a horde of bloodthirsty vampires you'd only be half right in this paint-by-numbers denture drama that's heavy on the red corn syrup and devoid of much else.<br/><br/>Heralded by some as the movie that puts the fright factor back in vampires after TV shows like Buffy and Angel turned them into lounge singers, crime fighters and less-than-threatening freaks of the week, 30 Days of Night did little more than vamp my ire at the Hollywood hype machine for marketing a fairly pedestrian big budget B movie as a new and innovative twist on a somewhat forlorn horror genre.<br/><br/>Josh Harnett stars as the uni-browed sheriff of this small Alaskan outpost, isolated from the rest of the state by a lack of roads and inaccessible by sea or (inexplicably) air during the winter months when the northern sun dips below the horizon throwing the town into the titular month long darkness. Thus the stage is set for an all night buffet as a boatload of vampires arrive at sundown and begin draining the town dry.<br/><br/>Based on the graphic novel miniseries by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith, 30 Days of Night teeters dangerously close to comic absurdity at times, particularly whenever the vampires communicate using a subtitled language that makes them sound like Slavic Chewbaccas with cleft palates. It's pretty hard to be scared when you're holding back the giggles as the lead baddie (Danny Huston) barks out something that sounds like ""ack wack bubba-duck bokay"".<br/><br/>Director David Slade does a good job trying to keep the story moving, however somewhere along the way, maybe in the screenplay or editing stage, what little that was interesting ends up being given short shrift in the quest to infuse the plot with action.<br/><br/>The enigmatic and talented Ben Foster, last seen chewing up the screen as psycho gunslinger Charlie Prince in 3:10 to Yuma, is wasted here as a mysterious stranger (seemingly the vampire ship's human captain  it's never explained) who wanders into Barrow with the bloodsuckers on his trail.<br/><br/>The result is a film that coalesces into a sort of Northern Exposure meets Night of the Living Dead, with little of what made the latter so terrifying, unless you consider three inch fingernails, bad dentures and blood smeared faces terrifying. In fact, this film contains none of the inventiveness, terror and interesting characters of Near Dark, the brutal 1987 Kathryn Bigelow vampire movie to which some are saying it shares the mantle of genuinely terrifying vampire films.<br/><br/>Yes, a pale ""horse"" truly does ride into Barrow, Alaska, however in this case the pallor is that of boredom and a poorly realized story, and nothing more."

","The film is set in Barrow, Alaska where for 30 days during winter the town is in perpetual night. The movie begins with everyone who doesn't have to be there leaving because 30 days without sunlight is somehow impossible to endure. Having grown up in Buffalo, I can assure you this is not true. So the movie sets up the town, depleted and cut off, vs. a troop of vampires, somewhat artificially but there you go. Initially the vampires run through the town killing everything in the their path. There's an overhead shot of this that is completely original and spectacular. I suspect that the director took it from a panel in the graphic novel but to film this shot is way more difficult than to create a static drawing.<br/><br/>Anyway, from there on in it's the vampires vs. the plucky survivors and plucky they are. There's a bit of ""I wouldn't do that if I were you"" going on but that's just unavoidable in a horror film and it's kept to a minimum. In general the survivors act intelligently and most importantly believably as they try and last the 30 days until sunup. That goes a long way to keeping the movie afloat.<br/><br/>The end offers a bit of twist although the final scene it is similar to Blade II.<br/><br/>I would say that if you like this sort of movie you will not leave the theater feeling disappointed or cheated."

This is not your half-comedic run-of-the-mill John Carpenter vampire flick. It's quite intense at times and not a movie you'd want to watch alone on a dark night. The vampire portrayals are quite gruesome -- especially the leader (Marlowe?) and his girlfriend (Iris?). (She's the stunning vamp chick with the long nose.)

The absolute terrifying prospect of vicious vampires stalking the protagonists grabs you for the duration of the film. Somehow the film is made believable, even though it is a totally unbelievable situation. There are certainly elements from Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot. The sense of horror resonates through your entire being from the word go. For anyone that enjoyed video games such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill this film is sure to thrill you.

"meganmorgan","7","6","12","9 November 2007"," review for 30 Days of Night
","Picture this: when Alaska is plunged into darkness for 30 solid days straight, a gang of vampires rampages a small town. This is the premise for the movie 30 Days of Night, and a very promising one, I feel. It almost makes one wonder how it hasn't been thought of before. Vampires, according to popular lore, cannot be in the sunlight, so storming a town kept in utter darkness for a month seems a genius idea. The movie, however, based on the comic miniseries by Steve Niles, was a bit disappointing and did not live up to the great premise that it set up.<br/><br/>The town of Barrow, Alaska, where the movie takes place, is so far north that once a year they experience a month of complete darkness, hence, 30 Days of Night. The movie begins with showing some members of the town leaving for the month, but many still remain, including sheriff Eben, played by Josh Hartnett. His estranged wife, Stella, played by Melissa George, misses the last plane out of Barrow and is forced to remain in the dark town for the month.<br/><br/>The first scary character is actually not a vampire, but something almost like one. This mystery character, played by Ben Foster, is captured and kept prisoner in the town jail. He has a Southern-sounding accent that might have been humorous, if only his lines hadn't been so cryptic. But when the vampires are later introduced, this stranger seems harmless in comparison. I found the vampires to be truly terrifying. They spoke in a hissing sort of language, and were always covered in someone's blood. But despite the fact that the vampires kept me quaking in my seat during the film, afterwards, I realized that most of the scares in 30 Days of Night were cheap.<br/><br/>For example, the scariest parts of the movie were when a vampire jumped out of nowhere, causing audience members to jump or shriek. The movie was also incredibly gory (it is, of course, a vampire movie, and this must be taken into account), but I felt like many of the jumpy and/or gory parts were only thrown in for the shock value, or the thrill factor. To me, the thought-provoking premise wasn't entirely backed up by the cheap scares. I wanted to be scared by plot development and scary concepts, not just blood and tension that something would pop out of nowhere. <br/><br/>This is not to say that the movie did not scare me, however. I was fully terrified by 30 Days of Night. Horror aficionados might deem me a wimp or a sucker, and this may be true, but I believe that this movie would be scary for most people, if perhaps not for those select fanatics who can't be shocked. 30 Days of Night is a good movie for anyone prepared to be scared in a haunted house type of way, as opposed to a The Shining kind of way. But if you crave background information, plot, and character development like I do, you may want to skip this movie."
"TOMNEL","4","6","12","28 October 2007"," Stupid, predictable, and really loud!
","For those who say 30 Days of Night was a new and innovative vampire film, I have no idea why you'd think that. This movie has a pretty standard plot (really the same plot as Night of the Living Dead, except with vampires in Alaska) with boring characters and dialog, and with lots of violence.<br/><br/>For my negatives, I'll start with the direction. I was glad that it wasn't filmed with a shaky cam. However to make up for that, it had this style where almost every scene was a close up on an actor's face. After about ten minutes of nonstop closeups, it got very annoying. The acting was not bad, but it was always too dramatic. Either the characters wait several seconds to answer each others questions, or the characters have close ups on their mouths to emphasize the drama of their lines. Again, it's an annoying technique. The characters were either cool calm, or they were a nervous wreck, there was never an in between with this one. Also, it was pretty annoying the scare tactics used in the film. The vampires run quickly past the camera and are loud then to scare the audience. But when they're coming up on people away from the camera, they're quiet (with the exception of their loud, extremely annoying vampire cries). These are the small things that bothered me.<br/><br/>The movie itself was a really grueling thing to watch. The plot of the film is a creepy stranger comes into an Alaskan town. He's picked up by the local police and tells them somethings coming. Of course, he is correct, and vampires come into town, during the month of complete darkness. A small group of survivors (led by Josh Hartnett) find ways to hide out and avoid the vampires for 30 days. The plan of the vampires to eat a town in 30 days of darkness sounds like a great plan, except, apparently, they didn't think that this town only has few people, and half of them, they turn into vampires. So how does this group of several vampires (who turns into more vampires later) survive 30 days off of these few people...who knows? But they do. Why do some people turn into vampires in a matter of seconds, and some it takes days? Who knows. How did these creatures keep the blood on their faces in the exact same areas throughout the film? Who knows. And there were many more inconsistencies throughout.<br/><br/>Aside from these problems, and the bad special effects, this had some good qualities. Some of the action scenes were interestingly shot, and even though there is no real reason to, the characters become somewhat likable. At times it feels like it might pick up, but unfortunately,, it doesn't.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a typically average vampire film that wasn't very scary at all.<br/><br/>My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 107 mins. R for violence."
"white_fire4","8","6","12","20 October 2007"," A decent vampire flick which is meant to entertain
","This is my first review ever on here, and given the last guys review of this, I feel I should start here.<br/><br/>You can always tell when people have never tried acting or being on camera themselves when you see comments about how unemotional a person acts on-screen. I've seen it a million times about Keanu Reeves, and it seems to be something Josh Hartnett is garnering a reputation for. If you actually pay attention during this movie, let it take you in, and aren't such a smartass and mocking it throughout, then you'll realize that Hartnett, while mostly intense throughout this movie, has a reason that is very underlined and very subtle. He's a protector, he cares for the town and it's people, just as he cares for those around him. In the midst of an attack by vampires, which shouldn't be real, he doesn't panic or get scared...he protects and does what he does best. Which if this situation were real, would take incredible courage and guts. Every other piece of acting is good...EXCEPT for the stranger. His character is good, his actor does a good job getting into it....until he says his 'bar the windows...try to hide' line. The way he says it just sounds so forced.<br/><br/>Aside from acting is the violence and gore, and there is a lot. If you have half a brain, from watching the trailer, you know this isn't a shy away from the violence type of film. While a lot of the violence is done in quick cut style, there are times when it flips and shows you a hell of a lot more than you're expecting....like near the end when Billy meets his end by first getting attacked and having half his throat ripped out, then pushing a vampire into a massive grinder, into which his hand gets sucked in, which is shown in great graphical detail, bones and all, and then he is beheaded before he changes, which again, in great graphical detail, unlike most of the beheadings before.<br/><br/>My only complaint about this movie is it's slight lack of realism when the characters move from place to place. They don't show it most of the time, they just suddenly pop up in the new spot except for the main characters. It isn't explained to us as if we were sheep, so it does require some thought and doesn't always make sense. The only reason I complain about this is because the general public will hate this, and it will make them hate the movie, which is a shame.<br/><br/>If nothing else, this movie is worth seeing for the incredibly interesting take on what vampires look like...many of which have their faces contorted in such sharp angles they almost look like a half changed werewolf at times...and to see the final confrontation between Hartnett and the ringleader of the gang of vampires....a very very awesome conclusion to that fight which has to be seen."

","Unlike some (many?) other reviewers, I prayed for sun light. I could've left the cinema, but I went into a late screening, so no hope there ... but seriously: This was a waste of time. Begins good (if you extract the obvious and bland character bits), but get's unbearably every minute that passes by ... I'm glad it isn't told in real time! <br/><br/>Back to some positive things: Josh Hartnett plays the lead role here and he's surprisingly good (for me he is at least). The lead vampire is OK, too. That's about it ... OK there's a bit gore that can excite you here and there, but that doesn't really get my blood flowing (pun intended) ... and speaking of which: Melissa might be good looking, but she can't really act, if her life depended on it (oops another pun?)! <br/><br/>What could've been the problem one might ask, with a plot outline like that (see somewhere here on IMDb for that)? Since I read interviews with the main players, I think I have an answer to that: They didn't know what they were shooting! From Josh over to Melissa, over to the head vampire up to the director, everyone had another genre they thought this movie belonged in ... Wanna know the real fun part? No one mentioned horror and/or vampire movie! Yeah right! Guess we have our reason, why the movie did suck at the end of the day (aww man, two puns in one sentence? There's no better way to end a review than this ...)"

WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT IN A FILM!!!!!!!!!!! really though there has been nothing in recent cinema that even resembles a decent horror film. OK, i mean a film that really does it all, scares(sort of), shocks, creeps, and makes you want to leave the theater(at times). this movie really does it all, and if you don't see that than you have no clue what you are talking about. this movie rules."

","When the movie first started and i saw people running around in -10 degree weather without being able to see their breath in the air, i knew that the movie wouldn't be good.<br/><br/>This movie relies on the cheap shock scare that, sadly, almost every scary movie has to much of nowadays. The only way to fill this much shock value into a movie is to make almost every camera movement incredible closeup and shaky. Like when the sheriff is checking out the Powerplant and hes looking around, then suddenly the guys head pops up on screen. It didn't just appear out of nowhere, it was just sitting there, but still there is a huge boom of noise and close up of the head when he sees it. Or when he finds one of his friends under a building after being attacked 7 days ago, and the camera suddenly goes to his face, we all knew he was changed but they had to do the whole shock value thing again when they showed his face.<br/><br/>But the worse part was when the hero goes out and confronts the lead vampire with infected blood coursing through his body, and the head vampire says ""The one that fights."" as if he is known as THE FIGHTER, hes only killed his friends, non of the other vampires.<br/><br/>Over all its melodramatic, and only good to take a girl to, so she gets SHOCKED into your arms, but if you looking for a good scary flick, too bad, you struck out."

","30 Days of Night (2007) <br/><br/>Review: Now the new genre is on graphic novels. Here is another one.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night is one kind of movie. This is a attempt at suspense horror, but fails on a lot of levels. Josh Hartnett plays the local sheriff of a small Alaskan town that winds up arresting a local stranger for a disturbance and locks him up. This stranger is just that, a total nobody that gives the rest of the crew the creeps about ""them"".<br/><br/>Enter a bunch of no name characters with almost no development and the very pretty ex-girlfriend and that's our cast. Then the vampires show up and kill. They start by killing helpless dogs just because of the barking. I am a dog person, so I hate it when dogs are killed. This still did not make much sense.<br/><br/>Enter the vampires. These have to be the most least frightening vampires since ""Blade:Trinity"". Their mouths morph in need of a bite and most look like a bunch of Emo-goth rejects with the utterly lame head vampire. They also speak in a native tongue not English. That really bothers me. It was irritating as hell.<br/><br/>At least there was something cool here. Great character actor Mark Boone Junior is here and has the best scenes in the movie by using a snowplow and a tractor to slay some vampires. These scenes are far too short, but well done.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night suffers from many plot holes. How did the people know exactly what day is it? Why did the vampires have the stranger creep out the local folk? Could they just invade without warning instead? How is it that being without a shower for so long can they still look good? Wow, for being without a bath for so long, her platinum blond hair is quite stunning.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett needs that one and only vehicle to launch his career into orbit, but this is not the way to start it. Nice try kid. Better luck next time.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Quite bad. At least I saw a trailer for Beowolf, so it wasn't a total loss."

","This movie promised so much and delivered so little...<br/><br/>Horror movies are great, they push the envelope with tongue and cheek, B grade it all the way or give us a taste of otherworldliness with a great story and ending...this fails on all accounts.<br/><br/>The acting was woeful, I hate watching film and having to suspend my disbelief in terms of what the characters look like and sound like. What accent did they have? Oz, Nz, southern American? Is everyone in Alaska that pretty and have lovely darling capped teeth? Cause if they are, this movie has done the Alaskan tourist board a favor, I'm going! What a joke.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the strangers performance but kept waiting for him to eat bugs...and he did not...what a break through in vampire movie history! I mean come on, this film is riddled with minor tweaks to the Vampire myth to make it seem different, ooh in part two lets see them eating garlic...yeah! I have read reviews and can't believe people are hailing the monsters for there apathy to human kind. My question is WHY? Are they hungry animals? Where did they come from? The boat from the beginning of the film- what was that!? (nice shot but didn't explain or suggest much) The monsters/""Vampires"" were one dimensional dribbling farces. It was rubbishy am-dram bird of prey acting, with clicks and giggles- although the editing and sound people did a good job to jump me once or twice...but that should be a given.<br/><br/>People might think Anne Rice and her team of dreamy think-too-much bunch of Vampires weren't hungry enough for some good Ole hunt down human savagery. BUT...at least we know who they were, where they come from. The basic ingredient of story telling- not to mention their scope of characters which actually go from young to old, mad to bad and ugly to beautiful.<br/><br/>The chorus of aliens/vampires in 30 Days, led by the big bad daddy Athiest all think through him. How boring! Why even bother having them talk, think and mention god at all- oh thats right, suppose you have to get 90 minutes in some how. I just hope I find out in part 2...if we are so lucky to see those tremendous actors grace the screen again. (Josh Hartnett not included) The zombie/Vampires were somewhere muddled in-between Velocerapters and the Jack off the shining, with no clear substance and a lack of decision making in the directing. I like clarity in my demons.<br/><br/>This is not a good film, nor is it average, it is not original and could of been something so much better- especially if naturally good looking people were used instead of wannabe white teethed hollywoodians.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading."

","If Josh can choose to immolate himself in the sun to keep a promise to his estranged wife does that mean that the other vampires are evil by choice? Or do you just become evil after centuries of chasing people down and eating them? If the vampires can smell blood why can't they smell a dozen or so people pooping for almost a month in a house right near by? Without power and sunlight in Alaska in the dead of winter how did they keep warm? Don't get me wrong I loved this movie as did my 12 year old son. The direction was crisp and the acting was good. Kept my attention like 28 Days Later but was not quite as good. Does anyone know why Sam Raimi backed out of directing and produced this movie instead?"
"muddevr","8","5","10","20 October 2007"," 30 Days was good
","I disagree completely with the previous comment. We saw the movie opening night at a Rave Theater with DLP and Digital audio, we were on a triple date that ranged in movie goers from me(I have been waiting for this movie for 2 months) to one of the couples who had never heard of it. There were a few jumpy parts and the movie was well done. It was a little different than the graphic novel, but still held together well as an adaptation. The movie created it's own rules about vampires, which is OK. The movie going experience itself plays a huge part of whether or not people enjoy the movie. I think the other couple just had a bad night. I don't listen to movie critics either, and I advise everyone else to see the movie for themselves. A writer for the SunSentinel in Florida said 300 was the worst movie she had ever seen...Are you kidding me. This just proves that critics(or even bloggers and commenter's don't know what you will like) So go see a Movie if you are interested in it."

There were many parts where i'd jump like a little girl...along with everyone else in the theater. Yeah it has some senseless violence sometimes but i'm a person who likes slasher movies over a suspense thriller. I thought the vampires were about as believable as possible in a vampire movie and their language was cool (i think it was Latin). One really cheesy part but up until the part it's pretty damn good.

Sure, it's a vampire flick with a pretty boy as the star, but if you can get over that initial realization and the associated horror, and just go with the flow, there is a good chance you might enjoy yourself.<br/><br/>There is some decent acting from a fairly interesting cast, there are some pretty scary and reasonably original undead, there are great visuals, obviously involving quite a bit of well-done gore, and even the script isn't all that bad. It's perhaps not an all-time horror classic, but it decent enough horror entertainment that could have been a lot worse.<br/><br/>I even like the ending---some might find it a bit overly melodramatic, and it probably is, but it has original plot elements and also some nice visuals. Pretty good overall."

Dark..Gore and Horrifying! Three major ingredients needed to infuse a well package horror-gore film. Some may call it the new blueprint for creating fantastic gore! Fans of both Horror Movies and Graphic Novels/Manga appeared in great numbers to see vampires take over Barrow, Alaska..slaughtering residents of their hope, faith and lives! Many people, like me , were on the edge of their seats waiting to see who would be next to die! You become engulfed within the story as it unfolds minute by minute. <br/><br/>If you were a fan of the graphic novel; you questioned if the movie would go in the direction of the novel. Or, would you become surprised at the end...would it disappoint you? One thing is for sure, this movie Does Not Disappoint!

","This is the first truly scary movie of this year's horror crop. I just got back from seeing this, and it was the most intense movie going experience I have had in a long time. Good acting? Check. Good plot? Check. Scary as hell vampires? Check? Heart in your throat moments of terror? Double check. This movie was non-stop terrifying from just moments in. Even through all the terror, though, there were very poignant moments throughout. The most poignant was probably the ending scene which sort of gives new many to the phrase, ""ashes to ashes."" But equally touching was the death of a character who had been turned, but wanted to die to join his already dead family. His death is heard off screen. Amidst all the blood and gore, he managed to have a dignified death scene. I don't really have much to quibble about. In fact, I can't think of anything at all that I didn't like about this movie."

My husband and I both thought she was cute...(looks like a cross between Eliza Dushku and Olivia D'Abo or Erika Eleniak depending on which one if us you ask)<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought the sound wasn't very good...and not in the scary parts, but just covering the audio during quiet dialogue parts. And I had some issues with the lighting here and there. Some scenes the characters clearly seemed like they were in the dark, others it seemed like broad daylight. No big deal really, any horror other horror movie, but the idea of this film was so hinged on the ""30 days of NIGHT"" i.e. DARK.<br/><br/>And the vampire language...sounded more like klingon than anything else... would think it would have sounded more germanic or slavic...it was just weird...not necessarily BAD...just something that was pretty easy to make fun of coming out of this movie...<br/><br/>Other than those little adds and the one disagreement I pretty much agree with the other post I read on here...I liked the gore in this and thought it was entertaining.

"KineticSeoul","7","3","5","11 February 2013"," It's a good survival horror vampire movie but nothing great
","When I first saw this movie in theaters I thought it was a great vampire movie. But seeing it now, it's just alright. It's entertaining but not as great as I once thought it was. Vampires in this is portrayed as savage creatures like beings that is just wild and crazy. Far from being civilized or methodical while doing some malicious actions. They just see humans and chase after them like wild animals. Which is kinda cool but they seemed more like zombies in a way, well zombies that run. The story takes place in Barrow, Alaska during a period where it's 30 days of night. And most of the movie is about the towns folks trying to run, hide and fight back. Josh Hartnett is in this as the Sheriff of the town but it felt like just about anyone else could have played his role. I mean he fit the role but nothing that really stood out. It's a good adaptation to the comic it's based on. And it's entertaining but it's not all that great. Or had any real shock factors or anything all that amazing for a vampire flick. It's a good survival horror movie. Also you know those movies where multiple people gather in a group and there is a high chance of survival if they stick together. But one person ruins it for everyone by saying they can't take it anymore and tries to leave. Well that is in this one and it gets pretty annoying to watch those kinds of scenarios.<br/><br/>7/10"
"fedor8","Null","3","5","30 March 2010"," Not based on a chewing-gum wrapper, thank God.
","There used to be a time when movies had been based on novels. Then, when they ran out of good novels to adapt to the screen, they resorted to cheap dime-a-dozen novels. Then short stories, and now comic-books. I guess it's only a matter of time until big-budget flicks use pamphlets as their inspiration... Chewing-gum wrappers, too? Toilet-paper rolls?...<br/><br/>Even worse, yet another vampire film.<br/><br/>The good news, however, is that not all comic-book-based films have to be unwatchable pieces of childish Dreck a-la ""Spiderman"" or ""Ghost Rider"". The other good news is that this isn't yet another dreary vampire flick. 30DON is the best ever horror film with fanged bipeds, if we discount ""The Hunger"" which is more like a horror drama. Gone is the suave, cape-wearing, coffin fetishist who woos the thick, impressionable maiden with his outlandish foreign accent. That's about as scary as an episode of ""Will & Grace"". <br/><br/>The third piece of good news is that the director of the legendarily asinine ""Hard Candy"" doesn't deliver rubbish this time around.<br/><br/>These vampires aren't interested in chit-chat, their coffins are well out of the viewers' sight, and they never open their mouths simply to reveal clean, polished, white Hollywood dentures. The make-up is terrific, unusual, the fact that they use an unrecognizable language gets thumbs up too. An extra third thumb up goes for the leader of the vampires; for the actor who plays him so well, and his overall look and behaviour. He never snickers like the stereotypical blithering idiot baddie, and that's rare in such movies too.<br/><br/>Sure, there's some nonsense, after all this is a vampire flick. The logic isn't all there, but the stylish direction, the visually impressive locations, and a fast pace make up for the flaws.<br/><br/>I would just like to know why an Owen-Wilson-like pipsqueak such as Ben Foster gets cast in sci-fi (""Pandorum"") and horror films. I was kind of hoping that the days of midget-heroes (Cruise, Gere, Dorff, Slater) were coming to an end. Wrong again..."
"robbilady","6","3","5","7 March 2008"," Some good, some bad, and some ugly...
","***SPOILERS MAY OCCUR HERE***<br/><br/>If you like horror, vampires, and/or believable imagery, see this movie. If you want rich character development and intellectual stimulation, move along.<br/><br/>I thought this was a very refreshing take on the vampire, although it could have been SO much better!!!! I have to start off by complaining about the editing, which was bad, BAD, especially in the beginning before the nice juicy gore came to distract me from this first of several shortcomings. The beginning just came off as an unrelated sequence of events...Ship arriving...sheriff finding mysteriously burned phones...murdered dogs...two almost distractingly attractive people dealing with an unexplained breakup...blah blah blah. Enter creepy guy, who was very well played...and then we have a vampire invasion! I did like the concept of 30 days of pitch black nighttime conditions, even if not entirely true. Okay, I can deal with that. Annoyingly, time in this movie proceeds unmarked except for the flaky ""day markers."" Another annoyance was that several of the human characters had absolutely ZERO survival instincts, such as shutting your mouth when vampires may be nearby. I was also distracted and very disappointed by the ""Men say, women do."" The women in this film were generally quite helpless, apparently, and would all be vampire fodder if not for the brave, heroic, self-sacrificing deeds of one handsome man. I wistfully yearned for (Circa 2003?) Dawn of the Dead, in which of course one of the strongest characters is a woman. And as soon as Harnett's character ""magically"" made himself a vampire, the ending became totally predictable: Against all odds and with no experience killing or hunting as a vampire himself, this dashing hero is going to challenge and defeat what is probably the most powerful and experienced bloodsucker in the bunch to save the day and then die. Yep, I was right. Onto something I'm undecided on: I don't know if I liked the vampires being so...obvious. Even the original Dracula himself could pass for a human. Not by much, as I recall, but he could. However, the vampires were visually terrifying. These Barrow vampires were sadistic and calculating, a pleasant aspect not seen in most good horror movies where some mindless ghoul chases the quick-thinking humans. And there is a stark lack of finesse in their feeding. Of course, the savagery of the way they ate was pleasantly disturbing/scary/wicked, but it didn't match their intelligence, forethought, and ability to manipulate. Their language did served well to hint at their character, however. I also found the lighting and general imagery very believable, not done to death with CGs. The end fight scene, I thought, was beautifully shot; the ring of vampires surrounded by fire was breathtaking. So that's it; maybe my 6/10 could be a 7; hope my ramblings helped someone in some universally meaningless way..."
"murrayspeer","8","3","5","11 November 2007"," A well-made vampire movie, though it lacks depth
","Whoever it was that said this was a zombie movie is insane. The characters even use the word ""vampire"" at one point. It's a freakin' vampire movie. That's why they're so fast and strong. Also, Eastern European, and with sharp teeth. Like, oh, I don't know... VAMPIRES!<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett does a really good job with his role, and the cinematography is really well done. There isn't a lot of depth of theme here - the closest the movie comes to any sort of self-reflection is a series of quips by the leader of the vampire clan that express some of their religious worldview - for example, ""What can be broken, must be broken."" The film suffers a bit from the fact that it is adapted from a serial comic book. Specifically, the story jumps ahead days at a time without any establishing of what has and hasn't happened in the interim.<br/><br/>The creative cinematography makes this a fun ""monster-gore"" movie, and the original premise makes it worth seeing. It's generally well-acted as well."

","I don't think I've enjoyed myself so much as when I watched 30DON. Forget reality and practicality for 2 hours and allow yourself on a roller-coaster of action and horror. The best thing about this movie is how they have redefined the vampire genre. No more do we have the suave ""Angel""-like character or the classic Bela Lugosi version. What we have is a ferocious wolf-like killer. Merciless and scary. A special mention for the camera work. The birds-eye view shot of the massacre is legendary. It gives a true feel of reality and chaos. It has to be seen to be appreciated. All in all, it is one of the best movies of the year and that's saying a lot with strong showings from 300, Die Hard 4.0 and Tranformers."
"secretagent_007","8","3","5","7 November 2007"," Well-made horror movie!
","I remember hearing the premise of this comic book/movie several years ago and thinking, 'Why didn't somebody think of this earlier?' It's set in Alaska just after the sun has set for 30 days - like Insomnia in reverse. But, as if that wasn't depressing enough, vampires have come to feast on the isolated town. No sun = vampire smörgåsbord! There have been some wickedly bad story pitches that actually got made into movies (bank robbery during a flood, Die Hard on a boat), so 30 Days of Night is a welcome reminder that there are still some smart twists on the genre(s) out there.<br/><br/>While quick cuts, loud noises, and things jumping out of dark corners are relied on too much, a tactile sense of dread is draped over the movie. The speed with which the vamps gut nearly the whole town is impressive and paints them as truly unstoppable. Before the victims can even react to their predators, they're dead. A few manage to stay in hiding through the attacks and it's those few the movie is about. They try to wait out the vampires until the sun rises again, moving from safe house to safe house, their numbers dwindling by the day. It's like a Holocaust movie where the Nazis are fanged monsters instead of just monstrous. Any bit of sound might alert them to the humans' location, so mum's the word. That being said, those people do make an awful lot of noise. And how come all the buildings look totally abandoned and dark from the outside, but when they go inside it looks like a suburban house on any other day, with lights on and all? Okay, so the director wasn't very careful about keeping the actors ""in"" the movie. It's a good thing there's more going on under the horrific gore (and there's quite a lot of that).<br/><br/>When the characters have to dispatch their foes, they do it like a person who's never killed before. Gunshots don't do much to the creatures. Their heads have to come off, at least, to put them down and keep them there. And even though the heroes must do it, they really don't want to. Sympathy goes out to the guy who had to chop the little girl's head off. It's brutal and present, much harder than just pulling a trigger. So what do they do when one of survivors gets bitten? This sort of immediacy drives the tension, just like it does in 28 Days Later. Wait, 28 Days 30 Days Hmm Recommended for the horror fan who's tired of the modern standard of torture porn and in the mood for something a little more classical. And if you want to see some gnarly beheadings.<br/><br/>http://www.movieswithmark.com"

But what you really have is a survival film, how are the townsfolk going to last for 30 days with such vicious vampires lurking just about everywhere?<br/><br/>Well director David Slade who made Hard Candy lays on the suspense and action with visual flair, so when the vampires do attack, a small group of survivors fight back, so for this type of movie to work, you have to have some inventive kills to keep the blood flowing and the adrenaline pumping, and you do get some nasty bloody kills to keep the horror fans happy. Neck's get ripped out, heads get cut off, vampires get shot left right and centre and even a kid vampire gets a gruesome demise, its all here in it's full bloody glory, the make up effects are very good. A special mention must go to Danny Huston as the head vampire, he embodies real menace and a genuine threat to the main players. <br/><br/>Well as vampire films go, you can put this up there with Near Dark, From Dusk Till Dawn and Interview With The Vampire.

"kevin_crighton","8","3","5","2 November 2007"," a gripping, brutal, bloody and very good vampire movie
","30 Days Of Night, is based on the graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith. It has a brilliant premise : a town that suffers a month without sun is attacked by vampires. Can anyone survive the month alive....? The movie is directed by David Slade, who made the impressive Hard Candy, and produced by Sam Raimi. I don't know how faithful it is to the graphic novel, but the movie is very good indeed.<br/><br/>One of the reasons for this, is that it does something that very few movies do recently....build up the tension at the start slowly, by allowing the characters a chance to develop before the action kicks in. Once the vampires do unleash their reign of terror, the movie turns brutal and bloody as the vampires rip, bite, tear people apart for food. This movie makes the creatures fearsome and terrifying, which they haven't been in movies for a while. I think the last truly scary vampires were in Near Dark and this lot are a match for them.<br/><br/>Led by Danny Huston, they at times are almost playing with their 'food'as they hunt them down, with a brutal scene where a lone woman screams for help while being followed by the vampires, while the survivors hide in buildings unable or unwilling to save her.<br/><br/>There is a fantastic set-piece where from an above shot, the camera moves over the town as the humans and vampires battle it out. Slade handles the action well, although at times it does seem over-edited during the attacks.<br/><br/>The survivors, led by Josh Hartnett and Melissa George are not your typical group. Led by the town sheriff and a fire marshal, they are simply a bunch of normal people hiding and praying they can last the month. In a typical movie they'd probably all turn into fearless killers, but not here.<br/><br/>The acting by the whole cast is impressive, with special mention to Danny Huston as the vampire leader, and Ben Foster almost unrecognizable as a stranger in town to cause disruption within the town to prepare for the vampires arrival.<br/><br/>The language of the vampires is well thought-out. Not English, but something different entirely.<br/><br/>If there is a criticism to make of the movie, it's that for obvious reasons it skips days as the movie progresses. As a result, it does feel like there are scenes missing. Also, although there are some good set-pieces within the movie (inculding a terrific one with a little girl), you would like to have seen more of the carnage inflicted on the town. As it is, it's mostly off-screen leaving it to sounds of gunshots and screams, although this does add to the tension and atmosphere.<br/><br/>The ending too is a slight let down, but to give credit it gets away with it by not giving you the Hollywood ending you'd expect, but a proper and slightly haunting end.<br/><br/>There's not much humour in the movie, which isn't surprising considering what's going on which is a rarity these days.<br/><br/>This is a serious horror movie, one of the best this year and certainly the best vampire movie for a long time."

In an age where horror movies are either not scary or just downright obscene, this one ranks among some of the best. It's intelligent and realistic portrayal of the vampire as a remnant of something human yet the purest of evil is very creepy indeed. Another important aspect to the film is the Alaskan scenery, photographed here to highlight it's exquisite finery. Once it's dark, you don't really care but there is some wonderful photography here."

","I have to admit i didn't have that high hopes for 30 days of night being any good, i saw the trailer and thought it looked pretty good but trailers are deceiving some times so i wasn't quite sure, so on the first showing in my local cinema on the night of Halloween i went and watched it and iv'e got to say it's definitely one of the best vampire movies i've seen. The whole movie was pretty tense and i could tell some people watching wanted it to end as soon as possible because they were scared s###less due to the gore and bits that made you jump and i have to say at times i was on the edge of my seat. Special effects weren't used that much apart from the vampires and the blood but it was all really well done and there were some very realistic decapitations and killings, the vampires were very messy eaters they kind of shook their head as they did which looked a bit weird and it made some people in the cinema laugh which i don't really think was the intension but it was all done effectively none the less.<br/><br/>Josh Harnett who i'm not a great fan of for his acting ability performs the part of sheriff Eban well although i found it hard to believe at his age he could be a sheriff, the rest of the cast were good too and they all acted to the situation believably there were no semi auto weapons fired while diving over a table or exploding barrels or anything stupid like that it was all realistic.<br/><br/>I really liked the birds eye view of the town when the vampires were trashing the place and killing everyone it was done brilliantly.<br/><br/>30 days of night overall was a great horror and not a action comedy horror like so many nowadays,it was a serious horror movie with no jokes but it was entertaining and i think anyone who likes the genre and has a brain when it comes to knowing whats good will like it.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."
"miketigas25","7","3","5","31 October 2007"," Not great. Just decent.
","A lot of people have been saying that this is, by far, the best vampire movie of the year. To some extent, that is true. Vampire movies have been rather few for the past couple of years so I do think that for the genre, this movie is a success.<br/><br/>First of all, let me just say that Vampires don't scare me. I find them more cool and amazing than scary. That being said, I was kind of happy that the vampires portrayed in this movie did not change my perception of them as being cool and amazing creatures (Well, it was altered a little but not too much). There were a lot of spectacular scenes that are worth remembering. But of course, with spectacular scenes comes a handful of annoying and unnecessary scenes as well.<br/><br/>Get this: why is it that whenever I watch a survival horror/thriller film, there's always this character that acts so stupid? I mean, when a group of people are put into a similar situation, would they really act that way? I do understand that that character was necessary so that the director could thrust in a good kill scene but heck! It's just annoying.<br/><br/>Several things I didn't like about the movie were the ending, the final scenes (what the main character did was like ""WHAT THE HECK!?""), the way the vampires communicated (cool for some but gibberish for me) and the realism of the characters' conditions (when the movie says ""Day 17"", the characters don't seem to look like they've been on that hiding place for 17 days. You get what I mean?). And, oh yeah, the constant camera close-ups on Josh Hartnett's face (It's like they're trying to make him the next Brad Pitt-esquire superstar).<br/><br/>Anyway, these are but minor issues that can be easily disregarded. It's a horror/thriller/action flick. Better yet, it's a survival flick. So just enjoy. Be scared. Bring your friends, family and sweethearts. Disturbing scenes were obviously removed for the Cinema (Note to self: buy DVD). However, some scenes might still be really disturbing for some people. All in all, a very decent vampire movie. Not really the best of all time but still arguably the best of the year."
"scout19d","7","3","5","30 October 2007"," 30 days is a fresh view on an old theme
","After reading many of the reviews, both good and bad, well I took time out from my schedule, no Sunday night football, to go to the movies. My wife is not into horror films and my kids are just too young for this genre. I am not going to go into the storyline, just a quick review from a 30 something. Not a classic. It is a movie with some questions to be answered, but it has an overall good horror gauge. The Descent was probably one of the best suspense horrors in the last ten years and it did not leave a ton of questionable antics. The great thing about this movie is that is done with a serious tone, none of those cheesy one liners and the actors do a good job of looking scared out of their mind. The villains in this movie are convincing. We do not get to know a lot about them, but one thing we know for sure they are brutal. I recently watched 28 weeks later and compared to the first one, the 2nd one had some silly crap in it and was overall a big disappointment. This movie was a good movie for a matinée price. I don't think it was worth the $8 i paid, but overall I was not disappointed."
"ituma","8","3","5","29 October 2007"," Unique vampire flick with fast paced, compact story line.
","Just saw this one last night in Castle Rock, CO. They cranked down the heat in the theater so it made the scenes of the arctic wasteland of northern Alaska even more bone-chilling. Compared to most horror movies today, this one has a more direct, old-school horror/drama feel. The acting is on par for this genre, although the female lead is a bit weak. It takes the viewer a good 20 minutes to really put together what's happening, but then builds to a continuously suspenseful, nearly 2 hour long movie. Minimal use of CGI with an even mix of on and off screen slasher scenes keep you toes curled. It's spine-tingling once you put together how the vampires actually get to this isolated region and how they move from one locale to another. The ending doesn't disappoint and leaves room for a sequel, but not blatantly. The only thing that disappoints is that the camera spends too much time on the vampires for the movie's own good. Collectively they can look like a crowd swept from the floor of an Eastern European disco at 3am after a hard night of Euro-trash style partying. Even in this movie, less would have made it better. Overall, the smooth, compact story line makes up for some cinematographic short-comings."
"kylekool150","8","3","5","26 October 2007"," When's the last time we had this kind of approach in a horror movie?
","30 Days Of Night is nearly two hours of sweat, swears and carnage. This film is also very dark, heavily plotted, and shocking. All these things I've described snap together to make 30 Days Of Night the best horror film of 2007, with the arguable exception of ""Planet Terror"".<br/><br/>We all know that in horror films, the violence is usually represented much more heavily and continuously, right? Well, in this film, it pretty much pushes that aspect to the limit, considering it is a comic book adaption. But this film, is so vicious, that you couldn't keep up with the death count even if you had a notepad and a pen on you.<br/><br/>The two actors, Ben Foster and Danny Huston, are surprisingly the leaders of the pack in this film. Even though they both aren't lead characters. Ben Foster, is an easily great actor, because he did pretty much everything his role asked him too. Danny Huston, is easily probably the best actor in the whole film, for his creepily effective performance as leader of the gang of vampires.<br/><br/>All together, without giving spoilers I can't describe to much about the plot that you wouldn't have already heard on IMDb. So all I can tell you is that this film is stocked full of thrills. Horror fans will adore it's no-barred grisly approach with how the violence plays through the film. Many, many graphic arterial sprays and other unimaginable and ruthless imagery you can only imagine in nightmares is placed on display throughout the film. If you're not a fan of horror, or are faint of heart, you will probably not enjoy this film to much, but if you are, you will go berserk. An energetic and brutal horror film.<br/><br/>3 of 4 stars"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","4","8","3 January 2009"," Vampires On The Snow.
","David Slade directs with a vampire flick. So what makes this different from other vampire movies? Well, the answer is nothing except that it is set in the far North where there is a season of 30 days of night (thus, these vamps will be safe from sunlight and rule for 30 days but there is a moment when Hartnett's character tries to kill them with UV but they are quick to cut off the power...). It is a very atmospheric film because the survivors are also victims of the weather and the whole little town itself plays a role. Slade manages to create a sense of isolation. The performances are... well, pretty much what you would expect from such films. The actors do the best they can with what's given. Josh Hartnett is quite alright as the hero. Melissa George is lovely. Ben Foster is annoying. However, it was hilarious to see Danny Huston in vampire mode. He is one of the last actors I would expect to see play a vampire. The vampire scenes are funny too. Especially when Huston's character talks gibberish to his cult and snorts order to his sidekick. '30 Days of Night' is strictly for horror fans. Normally I would choose a dozen other movies before deciding to watch this one but my mother and siblings really enjoy this kind of flick and I enjoy watching their reaction to it."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","4","8","27 October 2008"," Would had been nice if it had an actual story in it.
","This is a rather good genre attempt, that is good looking and for the fans of the genre is still a good watch, but overall it's lacking too much with its story-telling to consider this a truly successful and great genre attempt.<br/><br/>I think one of the problems with this movie is that it can't seem to decide for itself whether it wants to take on a serious and realistic approach or a more entertaining one. Result of this is that the movie features both of these very different approaches in it. Needless to say it doesn't blend in very well with each other. The one moment the movie is tense and unpredictable, the other its over-the-top and not really very credible.<br/><br/>But perhaps the foremost problem is simply the movie its story and how it flows. Things are just happening within this movie. Nothing is really ever being explained and it's not the type of movie that has a clear main plot line in it. It's about a very small town in Alaska being under the sudden attack of a group of vampires, during 30 days of night. This is the story. Nothing more, nothing less. It may sound good and simple enough for the lovers of the genre but the movie and its characters are all over the place. It's as if some sequences are missing at times within the movie and the movie often makes too big jumps. The one moment they are hiding in the police station, the other they are at an attic and then again at a totally different place. The movie often doesn't bother showing how things happened.<br/><br/>You'll also never feel attached to any of the characters really, since most of them remain very shallow and unknown ones. I mean, I surely don't know all the characters names within this movie, even those who have quite an amount of running time in this movie. I'm of course not talking about Josh Hartnett and Melissa George characters, etcetera, but about the rest of the townsfolk, who are hiding and trying to survive along with them. It makes this movie a somewhat shallow experience at times.<br/><br/>But no, none of this really takes away the fun of the movie. This is why the movie is still perfectly watchable for the fans of the genre. It's a good looking movie, that obviously wasn't cheap to made. The movie has some good make-up effects in it as well as some other nice effective gory special effects. Yes, the movie does feature some nice gore but this is not what the movie is all about. It's being somewhat pushed to the background and the movie is more about the survival of a group of people under some very unusual circumstances.<br/><br/>The movie constantly sticks to its main characters, which is also the reason why nothing is ever rarely being explained in the movie. Things are just simply happening within this movie, just as they are happening to the movie its main characters. The movie is based on a comic by Steve Niles & Ben Templesmith and the movie must have obviously sticked to its original source material. This approach taken by the story might work out fine and effective within a comic book but for a motion picture it's simply too lacking and not effective enough. Probably the reason why a lot of studios didn't really picked up this movie when being offered the change to produce it by the comic book authors.<br/><br/>It's nice to see how much Josh Hartnett as an actor has matured over the years. I don't think I've ever seen him in a movie ever since 2001 (with the expectation of his 2 minutes role in the 2005 hit movie ""Sin City"") and to me in my mind, Hartnett was still that very young actor who made teenage-girls drool with his role in ""Pearl Harbor"". It's nice to see that by now he has really become a man and is more serious and matured in his acting performances as well. He positively surprised me in this movie.<br/><br/>Could had been a great genre movie with a different approach and an actual clear main plot-line in it.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

But that didn't happen in this movie.Even though most of it was in the dark there was enough light to see every gory detail.Thank you David Slade for that.<br/><br/>David Slade did a superb job as the director.He built up the tension without a lot of those phony horror movie tactics and the lowers the boom when the time is right and never lets up.Hopefully Slade will get more directing chances after this great movie.<br/><br/>All the actors were good in this movie but special mention goes to Danny Huston who played the vampire leader,Marlow.He was spectacular as he crushed skulls and tore out throats.<br/><br/>This movie has restored my faith that there are still people out there who know how to make a great horror movie.I just wish it wasn't necessary to wade through 99 stinkers to find 1 great one like this.<br/><br/>This is a movie that horror fans will want to add to their collection.It is worthy of more than one watching."

","Film about a town in Alaska which, once a year, has only night for a full month. A bunch of vampires appear from nowhere (it's never made clear but it's suggested they came from overseas) and begin to slaughter the residents. A small bunch escape led by Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett). But the power is cut off, all the sled dogs have been killed, the cell phones destroyed and Oleson and others have to spend a whole month hiding and trying to survive from the vampires.<br/><br/>This movie does have a lot of good things going for it. The basic plot (based on a graphic novel) is not bad. The vampires themselves are impressive--vicious evil creatures who can move VERY fast. Danny Huston chews the scenery as the head vampire and they all speak in an eerie foreign language (the audience gets subtitles). The acting is pretty good with one exception and most of the attack scenes are fast, vicious and VERY gory. Still I didn't like it.<br/><br/>First of all--Hartnett. I've never liked him and this movie does nothing to change my mind--he's a terrible actor. He's the lead so it's a big liability. After the basic plot is set up everything goes by the numbers. You know who's going to live, who's going to die and the horrible predictable ""dramatic"" dialogue is just dull. Also the opening attack on the town is just so badly done it boggles the mind. It looks like it was edited by someone with extreme ADD! Things are going so fast and quick it's impossible to tell what's going on! The attack sequences that follow are better handled. Things do get a little better during the last half hour, but by then I was bored to tears by the horrible dialogue and cardboard characters. I only stayed in my seat because Huston was so much fun. He's having a great time in the role and it rubs off on the audience. Still, he isn't enough to save the movie. I give it a 6."
"aimless-46","7","4","8","24 October 2007"," Losing Their Heads
","As you have probably guessed, ""30 Days of Night"" is a vampire movie - which means it has elements of both terror and self-parody. It is very likely the year's best horror movie, coming from ""Hard Candy"" director David Slade. Nasty vampires methodically assault an isolated Alaskan town and theatre viewers rarely will find a moment to relax. Much like ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Phantoms"" there is a rapidly diminishing chance of survival in this world of perpetual darkness. <br/><br/>Although vampire conventions are followed, Dracula-type wooden stakes and silver bullets are conspicuously absent. The film's gory visuals are not for the squeamish which is exactly what vampire movie buffs and fans of the original graphic novels will get off on. ""30 Days of Night"" captures the coolest parts of Steve Niles' graphic novel series on the big screen. Like the books it is filled with buckets of gore but manages to include a certain intelligence that fans of ""28 Days Later"" and John Carpenter's better movies are searching for but can rarely find. While some horror genre purists will be turned off by all the talking, there is very little actual character development and enough action and suspense for most everyone. <br/><br/>There is even a geography lesson as we learn that Barrow, Alaska is the northernmost city in America, and even more isolated and alien during its annual 30 days of continuous darkness. During this period the vampires (who apparently have just discovered this vampire paradise) suck the blood of most everyone in the town. The exception being a small group led by Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and his ex-wife Stella (Melissa George), who must wait out the horrifying 30 days of night. The pairing of Hartnett (who has no discernible acting skills) with George (who is quite talented) could have been a disaster, fortunately neither part is particularly challenging so the skill disparity is not too obvious. And who watches these things for the acting anyway. Also fortunate is the casting of Danny Huston as the vampire leader, he sells his character (i.e. monster). <br/><br/>Much like ""Day of the Dead"" and ""Jumanji"" the band of survivors do things to which the average viewer can relate. They raid a supermarket and hide in an attic. It's best to stay vague with even the setup for this movie because it takes so many turns, at first seeming to be one kind of horror film before events move the characters in other directions. The surviving neighbors fight back with some degree of success. Watch for the town outcast who uses ""bulldozers for bazookas"", in the style of Sigourney Weaver operating that forklift robot thing in ""Aliens"". . Screenwriters Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie and Brian Nelson craft characters that don't make stupid decisions and a plot that doesn't turn on unrealistic coincidences. Those who didn't read the graphic novels might find some of the intricate plot turns a bit too cerebral for a mindless night out at the movies and detailed explanations are hard to find. But at least the filmmakers aren't trying to insult your intelligence. <br/><br/>It is nice to find a vampire film that is uncompromising in its violence and yet extremely subtle about its moments of self-parody (insert the Hartnell acting for a few laugh-out-loud moments late in the film). It's even nicer to find some effort put into realistic action sequences, not the fake fast cut nonsense that lesser directors use to mask their inability to shoot action scenes. <br/><br/>Adding to the terror is having the vampires converse in a demonic language of their own (subtitles are thankfully provided). The vampires move at lightning speed but have little going for themselves in style or culture (there is no ""Underworld"" sophistication here). There are be-headings, animal violence, the slaughter of children, and a ""Gremlins"" inspired use of a snow plow. Get it on guys. <br/><br/>Overall the film is well made, nicely filmed, and competently acted (even with the sometimes painful Hartnett factor). Obviously this sort of thing is not everyone's cup of tea but is great Halloween fare for those who get off on this kind of stuff. <br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

","30 Days of Night<br/><br/>113 Minutes of Disappointment <br/><br/>Total- 4.4 out of 10<br/><br/>Sound- 7/10 Vision- 4/10 Design- 5/10 Acting- 3/10 Story- 3/10<br/><br/>I love horror movies in general and specifically I enjoy vampire and zombie movies. From The Lost Boys, to I Was a Teenage Vampire, to Dracula with Bela Lugosi and the Hammer Film version with Christopher Lee, I like vampire movies. When I first saw the trailer for 30 Days of Night, I was excited for it since the premise is very original. After I thought about it, I'm surprised it's not been done in either a short story, novel or a movie previous to the graphic novel in 2002 ever explored this interesting and genre defying concept. I went to the theater excited to see 30 Days of Night. Don't get me wrong- I am more than willing to check my suspension of belief in the theater lobby before a movie- any movie, but if a movie is just too much it ruins the movie for me as a viewer. That's what happened with this movie. <br/><br/>30 Days of Night is probably one of the most disappointing I've seen in a long time, even with its new twist on the clichés of the vampire in films. Considering that David Slade directed Hard Candy, one of the most original movies in years that makes this movie doubly disappointing. Overall, the film has so many holes and ridiculous inconsistencies in the plot and story at the most basic levels that it becomes difficult and tedious to watch. One thing on the check list for me was that all these people are in Barrow, Alaska which is 320 miles north of the Arctic Circle, and you never see anyone's breath at all during the movie? I didn't care about the vampires or for the people trying to survive the vampires since you never really get to know much about either group on any kind of level since there was no real character development. Most of the human characters are little more than stock horror characters waiting for their chance to get killed by the vampires who never speak and never seem to clean up, apart from their leader who speaks in an unknown language. The gore and the violence never stops in this film and that seems to be the point of the film more than anything else. The last third of the film simply was ridiculous and totally unbelievable, leading up to an ending that made me shake my head in disappointment.<br/><br/>Technically, the best part of the movie was the make-up for the vampires which was very impressive and different. I did not like the herky-jerky, shaky hand-held camera which began every time there was an action sequence, that's just awful in general since you really can't see what's happening with the fight since the camera is shaking around. The shaky cam wasn't too bad with this movie, as compared to many other recent movies, but it was just another distraction. It seemed like half of the shots were either close-ups or 3/4 shots and in the beginning there was a bad two shot that just was annoying. There was one interesting but far too short shot of the vampires as they began their attack on the town. The music complemented the film and the sound effects were particularly good- I even heard the Wilhelm a couple times. The design and costuming were fine and were quite passable. <br/><br/>30 Days of Night is a great idea but a slightly below average movie. There were too many problems with the movie for me to just sit down and enjoy it. Wait for the DVD or to see it on Cable if at all. Better yet, watch either version of The Thing, which 30 Days of Night seems to have copied a little from."
"killpeet-1","1","5","11","12 January 2014"," Spoiler-free lament of time wasted.
","Despite an interesting premise and some nice visuals, 30 Days Of Night is a dreary humorless mess which is entirely too long and incredibly dull. I've just recently started renting discs from Netflix again and decided to catch up on things I've missed over the last several years. For some reason, this was my first choice. Ouch!<br/><br/>The humans characters aren't so bad, despite being a collection of clichés. None of them are particularly memorable, but nobody will care about that because this is a movie about vampires. I've learned is that vampires like to wear nice black blazers or cocktail dresses, evidently are incapable of closing their mouths all the way at any time, speak a mixture of Huttese and dolphin screeches, and can leap like monkeys until the action dictates that they suddenly need to stumble around like they've dropped a deuce in their drawers. Honestly, I was more impressed by the vampires in Twilight (and that's something no person should ever say).<br/><br/>Despite those misgivings, I can safely recommend this to you if you're a big fan of sped-up jumpy-shot rapid-cut movie making, or the sight of people doing the ""rawr"" pounce pose while they're being lowered into the shot like they're some idiotic thrift store ninja. Unfortunately, I am not, and as a result I found this movie to be a fairly agonizing experience, enjoyable only for the colorful remarks I found myself uttering at the screen.<br/><br/>Instead of watching this mess I could have been doing something useful with my life. I could have cleaned my living room, for one. I could have called up old friends. I could have cooked a nice meal. I could have painted! I did none of those, and for that I am sorry."
"gavin6942","7","5","11","20 October 2007"," Despite Some Bad Casting, a Well-Made Film
","In Barrow, Alaska the sun sets for an entire month and the villagers are given 30 days of night... most of them are smart enough to leave for Anchorage, giving this town a population of 152 brave souls. But this year, they have visitors: a clan of ancient vampires has staked out the town and wants nothing more than to spend the next thirty days gnawing and clawing through every living thing in sight. How do you kill the undead? <br/><br/>This film received some unbelievably high ratings. For my first viewing (in the theater), I was expecting a decent but not amazing film... with the excessive level of advertising, I had to figure they were going to inflate the box office numbers (something often reserved for less than wonderful films). I left the theater unfulfilled: a film that seems to have one of the best ideas imaginable made by a team that seemingly did not know how to make a horror film. Too stylized, too clean...<br/><br/>We have Josh Hartnett as Eben Oleson and Melissa George as Stella Oleson, the husband-wife sheriff combination, who are having marital problems. They are just annoying. The pretty boy marries the pretty girl and they run the town full of ugly people? Thanks, Hollywood. Oh, they have family problems but are forced to love each other by a crisis? Thanks, Hollywood. Oh, Hartnett is going to be clean-shaven and wearing a light coat in sub-zero temperatures so he looks cute? Thanks, Hollywood. By far some of the worst casting... <br/><br/>The vampires were a major problem for me. They walk around with blank stares on their faces, over-acting their parts (what are those faces). The leader occasionally spouts a line of nonsense philosophy. They screech and screech non-stop. Okay, I get it, you screech. You are annoying me. And they run really fast (which would not be bad, except a sizable bulk of the action happens so fast you never see it). I prefer sleek, intelligent vampires (Anne Rice or Bram Stoker variety) over ravaging monsters.<br/><br/>I am also unsure about the ""thirty days""... the film really only takes place over about four days. Where are the other twenty-six? Apparently they sit for five days, act on one day, and sit for another five days. Am I really to assume no one tries to fight the vampires for long periods of time? I understand the concept was ""thirty days"" but this really did not play into it (nobody was starving or thirsty, for example).<br/><br/>I have ripped on it enough, let me say a few good things: Ben Foster plays the Stranger. I am not sure if I loved his acting, but I loved his character, and could have used more development on him. Early on he comes across as a Crazy Ralph knock-off, talking about death, doom and gloom. But he becomes a Renfield-like character and gets interesting. I wanted more of this, but never really got it.<br/><br/>The music was good -- actually very good (I liked the battle march), and as my colleague Greg Roberts says, the cinematography was nice. I do not know about great, but one scene really stood out as awesome -- an overhead shot of the city being destroyed. It was amazing and made me want to play a video game version of this film. There is also a good shot of what an ax does to a man's head, but that only made me wonder why I did not get more of that action if they were capable.<br/><br/>The most bittersweet scene was with a vampire girl. Children are good villains, especially evil vampire children. But they did not keep her around very long and introduced her with the most off-putting, unnatural line in the film (""Want to play with me now?""). I could understand maybe ""Anyone else want to play?"" or ""I want to play with someone else"", but her self-referencing herself as having turned into a killer was just really stupid and poorly delivered.<br/><br/>Give me this film with more blood, more shots of actual violence (instead of doing it lightning speed or off the screen), less family drama, less slow build up. And do not give me Hartnett and George without at least dirtying them up (though I admit Hartnett was great in ""Black Dahlia""). This film had more potential than most films coming out today, but squandered it all to be a Hollywood film.<br/><br/>Update: Apparently my memories are fonder than my first impression. I went to my second viewing at House of Horrors in Oshkosh and sat down recalling a flawed but overly enjoyable film. After it was over, it was even better than I remembered. Reading this review, I am not sure what caused me to be so harsh on a David Slade and Sam Raimi film. I still think the casting was bad and the girl vampire was stupid, but the overall vampire feel is good and the cinematography is breath-taking. I had to bump this review up just a notch or two."
"ChiefGoreMongral","8","5","11","20 October 2007"," GoreMongral's Review: 30 Days of Night
","Horror movies have slowly been coming back to what made them...horrific. The 90's saw the unfortunate demise of horror thanks to the horror spoof/horror lite material that surfaced. Movies like Scream, IKWYDLS and the like changed what Hollywood viewed as true horror and unfortunately what an entire generation viewed as horror. Luckily things are slowly coming back to what they should be and a good example of this is 30 Days of Night.<br/><br/>Barrow, Alaska...the top of the world and also a place where for 30 days a town is shut off from the rest of the world as darkness settles. Enter Sheriff Eben Oleson who has just saw nearly 3/4ths of his population leave due to this and unfortunately replacing them is a horde of vampires that would like nothing more to feast on the remaining 4th of the town. The sheriff and the rest of the town are faced with a grave question, how do you fight off an army of the undead for 30 days.<br/><br/>One of the first things that makes this film work is its somber lack of humor. Horror movies have over the last decade changed peoples views as they tend to cry about lack of humor to lighten a mood. Correct me if Im wrong but this is horror not the next Will Farrell movie. No humor is found here and the humor that is there is the acceptable kind. Normal conversation humor unlike the kind we see in so many of the ""modern' and ""90's"" films that literally wink at the camera.<br/><br/>Also the feeling of dread is around every corner as you never know where or when the vampires will attack. People are pulled out of there homes like someone picking and apple from a tree some more grueling than others but all are violent. The violence factor in this one is very high and the gore on display is nice. For gorehounds I feel you will be pleased, several decapitations, lots of ripped open jugulars and a severed arm or two are on display but don't expect every kill to be gory. Do however expect each one to be visceral and violent.<br/><br/>The Vampires on display as well are very nice. Looking like an unholy union between Marilyn Manson and Jaws, they are smart and very tactical but are very savage resembling a pack of wolves ready to strike at there pray. The only difference is when they attack they are much more lethal. These vamps will not ask you to invite them in or try to charm you they will bust down your door and rip you to shreds before you know what hit you.<br/><br/>The characters here are very believable as well and for the most part I could believe the action on display here. Now absurd over the top scenes to ruin the mood of dread here, only a few acts of genuine heroic attempts that are all plausible. Believe me there is no removal of mood throughout as it will keep you intrigued up to the very end.<br/><br/>The actors on display were all up to the task even Josh Hartnett (surprisingly) but the real show stealer in my mind is one of the best up and comers Ben Foster as the Stranger. Though he has a limited screen time his character sets up the dread to come with an err of creepiness that comes off like a cross between a crazy mountain man and Dwight Frye's Renfield character from the classic 1931 Dracula. Horror director's need to cast this guy as often as possible as he pulls this style of character acting off without a hitch. In the end the somber mood the violence and the fitting end make this one of the best horror movies of the year. Director David Slade who's previous work ""Hard Candy"" was nothing short of stellar has nailed two great movies out the box and is definitely a director to keep an eye on in the horror scene With its nods to the best in classic horror like John Carpenter's The Thing and its genuine old school approach this is one that all the old school horror heads can get behind and tell the unfortunate horror raised youth of the 90's and early 2000's ""Now that's a horror movie"".<br/><br/>8/10: Very Good, One of Best Horror Movies of the Year and what Im hoping brings us even closer back to what makes horror so good. Go see this without hesitation and support a great film."
"jwerwin80","7","5","11","20 October 2007"," A Fun Ride While It Lasts
","I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I expected to. The first two acts are great. It starts to drift into lameness during the third act, but trying to find a way to come up with a positive resolution must have been pretty tough. What makes this movie fun is the sheer hopelessness of the situation.<br/><br/>Another plus is that the movie takes a little more time than usual to introduce us to all the characters and set up the premise. Horror movies frequently rush through the setup. This one lets the action tell the story -- we're spared the stupid character speech that tells us the who set up.<br/><br/>The attention to story telling, combined with the dark setting, make this one a lot of fun. I just wish the ending had been stronger."
"DonFishies","6","5","11","19 October 2007"," Visually magnificent, but lacking a little too much in plot
","30 Days of Night as you can probably guess, is about just that. A town in small rural Alaska, the northern-most town in the US, experiences a phenomenon where darkness sets upon the town for an entire month, and leaves most residents scrambling to get out. But unfortunate for those who stayed, a pack of hungry vampires has found the town and decides they should get fed. And as the dead begin to outnumber the survivors, it becomes very clear that those who can stay alive need to wait out until the sun finally comes up.<br/><br/>The sheer idea for the film, having the town being draped in darkness for a month, is nothing short of astounding. Yes, it was lifted and is based on a graphic novel, but compared to your typical vampire-related horror flick, it is quite the step up. And as the film sets itself up for the feeding frenzy, it really continues to breathe originality and a blazing sense of imagination. Some of the things happening may not strike you as being particularly relevant at first (or even, who would do some of these things), but as the film moves along, it just all feels so right. And with a very sombre and coked-out character only referred to as The Stranger (Ben Foster) making bizarre predictions of the inevitably obnoxious death scenes soon to come, the film really feels like it is going to jump past the clichés, the terrible American horror norm, and become something extraordinary and memorable.<br/><br/>But then the film betrays itself. It takes far too long to set up the motivations of the main character, Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett), his separated wife Stella (Melissa George), and even more time on supporting characters like the burly Beau Brower (Mark Boone Junior). I just got far too restless, and even more so when I realized only a few of these characters would make it to the final frame of the film. Why should we care about these characters when these laggy scenes just do nothing but introduce their one-dimensional selves, and not much else? It felt kind of like overkill, but also like the film was trying to compensate for having such a great idea, but no idea as to how to flesh it out.<br/><br/>And when the survival scenes begin to kick in, it becomes even more of a hit and miss. Some scenes are genuinely terrifying and suspenseful, watching the characters try to cope with decisions of wanting to save their fellow townspeople, or just sit in genuine fear of not wanting to be the next victim. But then others drag on with meaningless drivel about absolutely nothing. It just cannot find the balance it needs to survive this pitfall of the idea for the film, and just does not seem to want to attempt more than a handful of times to try and amend it. And do not even get me started on the preposterous ending, which seems ripped out of an entirely different movie altogether (sad to say, it is almost shot-for-shot intact from the graphic novel).<br/><br/>But while the film does have its share of story and pacing problems, the scenes with the vampires attacking are just plain stellar. There are more than a handful of quick cuts, but the majority of the scenes involving them eating their dinners are stylistically beautiful. There are some shots that are just so majestic and so powerful, that one wonders if they are actually in the same horror movie, or if they randomly started splicing in some art-house horror. The tracking shots, the close-ups, the long shots, they are all here, and are all so brilliantly played that the style just takes anything the movie has going for it, and catapults it right into the stratosphere. And even as the violence gets even more senseless and even more graphic, you cannot help but watch in awe at the visuals captured by the camera (and by CGI). Their exquisiteness is enough to make me pray that other mindless (or near mindless) horror flicks take note, and start creating similar if not better visuals. The music is above and beyond top notch as well, giving the film a really heightened sense of style and intense violence (albeit, nowhere near as blood-soaked as I had originally assumed it would be).<br/><br/>The cast, for the most part, is alright. Hartnett has seen better days, and for some reason, seems to be struggling as the lead here. Maybe he had something else on his mind? Some of the scenes he is in just do not completely jive, and when they do, there is awkwardness to all of them. I do not like to even imagine saying it, but it looked like he had more heart to show off in Pearl Harbor, then he does here. George on the other hand, does an infinite amount better, continuing much in the same way she did in the very poor remake of The Amityville Horror. She had an aura around her there that felt like she was above the material, and the same aura appears here. Foster, for his limited amount of screen time, does a great deal of delivering dread and despair for a few of the characters. I wish he had more scenery to chew.<br/><br/>But it is John Huston, more of a classically refined actor, who owns as the vampire leader. He does not speak any English (he communicates in the vampiric language and through grunts and body motions), but that does not stop him from being almost downright terrifying. Seeing this guy at work was a real pleasure, and I just wish the rest of the film was as well done as his performance is.<br/><br/>Nagging issues aside, 30 Days of Night is a decent horror film with aspirations of being better than it is. Watch it for the visuals, and forget about the plot.<br/><br/>6/10."
"tapping_2003","1","9","24","10 November 2007"," 7.1...has everyone gone mad!?
","Right I felt compelled to post my first comment on IMDb after watching this monstrously poor attempt at a horror movie. This movie sucked (excuse the pun) on every level...non existent plot (really..why were those things there? where did they come from? what the f*ck was the point?) awful acting by everyone...although to be fair the script was so poor they didn't have a lot to work with...not one interesting character in the whole film...it really felt like I was watching a crap Masters of Horror episode! Its not even like it had any decent gore effects to redeem it from the mire...aside from one scene where a character drives a tractor with a huge chainsaw attached to the front through a crowd of the rubbish fast zombie vampire things. Best film so far this year...3.10 to Yuma...worst film this decade goes to this steaming pile of sh*te!"
"thomasjay-2201","7","2","3","12 August 2019"," One of my favourite horrors
","This is almost a living, breathing comic book, the setting is perfectly small giving the idea that everyone knows everyone and such the horror is even more effective when it comes to play. Ben Foster as a pseudo narrator/literal harbinger of doom is exceptional usage of such a talented actor and the cast made largely of ""nobodies"" deliver truly astounding, grounded performances that make the inevitable deaths of the odd individual further harrowing and utterly brutal. The constant setting of night time is also super effective and this interpretation of vampires is very unique. No cheap scares, logical actions this is a great watch"
"sauravjoshi85","6","2","3","18 March 2019"," Ending could've been better
","Firstly the movie gives you some enjoyment and will keep you entertained. The plot of the movie was not written well as director never mentions the origins of Vampires. There were few flaws which could be ignored. Acting is good, location supports the story. Screenplay could've been better and director could've told the plot better. Overall the climax could've been good."

"MitchellCombden","8","2","3","30 September 2016"," a refreshing vampire tale that takes the creatures of the night back to their gritty roots.
","30 days of night (07) directed by David Slade is an excellent film. the vampire sub genre has relied on films like The Lost Boys (1987) and Interview with the vampire (1994) for quite some time. vampires had become more sensual, seductive and hip than terrifying, gritty and savage. this movie takes them back to their roots. portraying them as savage bloodthirsty creatures that are actually scary. this paired with the rather fresh premise of 30 days of pure darkness in a small Alaskan town, makes for a wonderfully refreshing vampire film.<br/><br/>David Slade's direction here is actually quite good, he had a reasonable budget to work with and it showed. gorgeous sweeping helicopter shots, great photography, and some really nice crane shots. Slade knows how to get full effectiveness out of his premise with his ability to create an excellent sense of total isolation with these big sweeping shots, and he also shows his ability to create some intensity with his more personal shots. while definitely not Fincher or Coppola level direction it is still very good and worth mentioning. we are also treated to some very good lighting and sound design, which adds to the intensity and tension of the film.<br/><br/>the vampire designs are very creepy and effective. while not the most exquisite or flashy, the costumes and makeup look great and are genuinely creepy. also the special effects are amazing. the gore looks very intense and there is a lot of it, which makes sense in such a brutal and gritty vampire film. the entire cast give great performances here, the standouts being Josh Hartnett and Melissa George. Hartnett's character is portrayed with realism and logic and does not come across as cheesy or over the top. the same applies to George's character. we also don't get a lot of characterization or back story on our leads or the vampires. this however works very well. we get a smidge of backstory for our leads which makes them seem like real characters that aren't just wooden horror characters. and in regards to the vampires we get no back story or characterization for them at all which works so well. it shrouds them in mystery as well as helps portray them as savage and unforgiving beasts that have no real motive other than being hungry.<br/><br/>overall 30 days of night is a very refreshing vampire film that brings the vampire sub genre back to its roots and makes vampires scary again. great acting, premise, direction, lighting, vampire design, setting, and gore effects. if you want to watch a truly scary vampire film, with some good gore and some genuine intensity check this one out, you wont be sorry.<br/><br/>the verdict: 8.5/10"
"utgard14","6","2","3","24 August 2015"," ""You ain't gonna eat me!""
","Sheriff Josh Hartnett tries to defend his isolated Alaskan town against a gang of vampires that strike during the annual period where the town experiences 30 days of night. A very cool idea for a horror movie, based on a comic book, that never quite reaches its potential. It's entertaining enough but not scary. Director David Slade cares more about action sequences of vampire attacks and people fighting them off than build a terrifying atmosphere. The movie has two basic speeds: too slow or too fast. It never manages to find a perfect balance.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett does a fine job despite seeming too young for the role of a sheriff that a whole town respects and looks to for leadership. Melissa George, Manu Bennett, and Mark Boone Junior are among the other 'good guys' that stand out. The vamps are led by Danny Huston, who is neither charismatic or frightening enough to make an impact. Ben Foster gives a wonderfully hammy turn as a Renfieldesque character who gets most of the movie's best lines. The direction is uninspired and I can't help but wonder how much better this could have been with a director at the helm with more style. Sam Raimi was one of the producers of this and I can only imagine how much more visually interesting the movie would've been had he directed it. It's an enjoyable movie but, like I said, I think it had potential to be something more. As it is, it's a nice popcorn horror flick with a decent cast and an interesting backdrop that goes on a little too long."
"bournemouthbear","8","2","3","21 August 2015"," Vampire Flick that Has Bite - A Rare Thing of Late
","You may think that you have had bad days. Imagine this, being stuck in a small Alaskan town with no sunlight, not just for one day but for THIRTY during its winter period. For those affected with SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) this would be bad enough. Factor in a bunch of vicious vampires making the most of the darkness offered and chances are things couldn't really get much worse.<br/><br/>Not everyone chooses to stay around in Barrow during this period of extended darkness, with most of the small town's five hundred population heading south, leaving just 152 willing to brave it out. Into this community comes a stranger (Ben Foster) who sets about stealing and burning all mobile phones (rather improbable), trashing the only helicopter and ((SOB)) offing all the doggies.<br/><br/>Incarcerated by Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George), the stranger continues to put a downer on things by announcing that death is coming to the small town. Pretty much as the words fall from his gob the town's power is cut off - as if it wasn't dark enough already - and a pack of vampires attack the town in a spectacular and devastating fashion.<br/><br/>With the nearest town eighty miles away the surviving members of the initial attack band together to find a way out of their extraordinary situation.<br/><br/>Considering how dire much of the output from Sam Raimi's Ghost House Productions has been, it is pleasing to report that their latest, 30 Days of Night, is doing exactly what you'd expect of a production company out to spook. Based on the graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith, the first of a comic book miniseries of the same name published in 2002, the aim was to make a scary vampire movie from the source given that there had been a lack of these of late.<br/><br/>Director David Slade exploded onto the movie scene with his acclaimed feature-début the goollie-worrying Hard Candy (2005). His style feels like early (read, better) John Carpenter. Think Assault on Precinct 13 set against the snowy wilderness of The Thing and you get some idea of the vibe Slade has created - even the film's soundtrack feels very Carpenter.<br/><br/>Slade's movie brings to mind Zack Synder's Dawn of the Dead remake. In much the same way that Zynder had his zombies full on, Slade has his vamps jumping and leaping and even has a little girl vampire as Synder had a girl zombie for his sensational opening. And like zombies these vampires can be shot in the head in order to be dispatched.<br/><br/>In terms of performances, the always-reliable Danny Huston is a stand- out as vampire leader Marlow. Given that his performance is restricted to snarling and speaking in an ancient dialect it's not exactly a role geared to elicit a thespian's strengths, so it's to his credit that he still manages to exude an extraordinary level of menace. This is one sucker you definitely don't want to bump into.<br/><br/>Watch out also for Mark Boone Jnr as Beau Brower, the local snowplough driver. A fixture in many genre pictures, from the underrated Dead Birds to the fun Frankenfish, Boone Jnr adds another credible support character to his belt and steals the show with a key scene involving his snow plough.<br/><br/>Interestingly the leads Josh Harnett and Melissa George, with genre pleasers Halloween H20, The Faculty and WAZ between them, have the least interesting roles as the estranged couple but it's their relationship that ultimately shapes how the vampires are defeated come the rather melodramatic ending. In fact the estranged lead couple is a story thread that has been done to death but here it feels a welcome comfort like saying hello to an old friend.<br/><br/>That said 30 Days of Night is not about building up believable characters, it's more about situation. This is a story ripped down to basics. It's relentless and never feels tired all the while toying with genre conventions. The movie plays it straight, no silly throwaway quips. This is a proper hide behind the cushion / snuggle-up-to-your- loved-one movie. It isn't just about gore. It's about cranking up the tension and it does it with aplomb. Vampire movies don't get much better than this.<br/><br/>Check out more of our reviews at www.mybloodyreviews.com"
"msmchug","8","2","3","6 December 2014"," Proper scary vampire flick
","I love this film. There are so many vampire movies out there but this one is in a league of its own. The film is about a small Alaskan town that goes dark for a month every year. This winter the most evil believable vampires attack the town and take out most of the population. The main characters are the sheriff Josh Hartmett and his kind of side kick leading woman Melissa George. Ultimately the vampires are there to kill everyone and suck the town dry. Most people get killed of pretty rapid and things are left to the sheriff and his closest friends to try and survive/ escape the vampires. In order to save the day the sheriff decided to make the ultimate sacrifice (himself). I won't ruin the end but its really good and different from all the other films in the respect that the heroin gets a pass to the final. These vampires are not pretend humans. They look and act ancient. They speak a forgotten language and do this awful howl when they are in a pack, and they are very fast. There are lots of great scenes in this film that had me almost holding my breath. Omg the fear is amazing the film is quite dark, and feels scary when your watching it and that's what a horror should do."
"bowmanblue","8","2","3","30 October 2014"," These vamps don't twinkle
","Ah, vampires, those pillars of the community who go to your local highschool and have pretty gold eyes because they only hunt animals. Oh, and they twinkle too in sunlight. I'm very pleased to say that 30 Days of Night isn't anything like that.<br/><br/>These vampires have fangs that would make mincemeat of Kristen Stewart's neck and have a nasty habit of slaughtering every man, woman and child they meet. And they meet Josh 'the beard' Hartnett in his Alaskan town which is so northerly that the sun doesn't rise for thirty days (hence the title, right?).<br/><br/>What follows is a story of survival, where the handful of remaining townsfolk (led by Hartnett's beard) have to last the thirty days before the eventual sunrise which will kill their undead foe (of which the head vampire bears more than a passing resemblance to Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys... but with bigger teeth and a thirst for blood, rather than poppy dance anthems).<br/><br/>And it's good (if you don't look too closely). It has impressive action set pieces, characters you care about, plenty of gore to keep us 'claret-lovers' entertained and vampires who you don't want to slap for being so wet and 'Emo.' It could all be a classic, if it wasn't for the fact - and you might want to skip this bit, just in case you don't notice - that the whole 'thirty days aspect' seems to be well and truly glossed over. In fact, it could all happen in one night and you'd be none the wise.<br/><br/>But that is a slight niggle and, if you like your vampires old fashioned and nasty (as opposed to falling in love with teenage waifs who are incapable of cracking a smile) then you should like this (although, whatever you do, don't watch the sequel - it's a terrible attempt at cashing in on the success of this one)."
"CrisMovieCorner","8","2","3","24 October 2014"," A triumph in vampiric cinema!
","I remember the first time I seen this film, was during its original run in the cinema in 2007 I was 17 at the time so getting in for an 18 certificate film was ALWAYS fun back then. I miss the old days of sneaking in or tricking cashiers into believing the age. Anyway, on to the review.<br/><br/>As night falls on an Alaskan outpost village where it will stay dark for the next month, a murderous crew of vampires come creeping into the village for a feast where they plan to feast on the mortal souls of the skeleton crew that keeps the village going. Main trouble is Marlow's (Huston) crew are almost feral like monsters like vampires should be. When the vampires arrive so does the loss of power including phones and internet, with the nearest town over 80 miles away the inhabitants know they are in trouble.<br/><br/>It takes them more than a few hours to realise how dire the situation they have found themselves in has become, meanwhile the crew of vampires are attacking with brutal violence and humans being ripped apart after they are running the streets expecting to actually fight these monsters. Each time resulting in their earlier demise, it is around this point that Sheriff Olseon (Hartnett) and his band of merry men are starting to realise they have no hope or chance of survival so they go to ground to play the waiting game. Which does not result in the outcome that they want, the vampires just keep coming picking people off like it is all for fun.<br/><br/>Overall, the film isn't your typical Horror film it is a far cry from some of this boring ass vampire crap we have had in recent years, I would go as far to say it is the best vampire film in the past decade potentially the past two excluding Blade while a vampire film I still consider it prominently a comic book film. The film is also beautifully gory and refreshing in its approach to the deadly action and the fact they do not use silly one-lines or use the typical jokes when something gory happens. They try to humanise the world in which these vampires exist, making the actors fear what they see or are experiencing like a lot of other films.<br/><br/>The film is a thoroughly enjoyable watch, full of gore, action, Horror and brilliantly written scenes. There is some missed opportunities in the film like in all others, their main could be said that they under use the talents of Danny Huston he doesn't nearly get enough usage as he deserves. In conclusion the film is a triumph by relatively new director (at the time) David Slade the best vampire film since Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" over two decades ago."
"crfarley-836-616453","9","2","3","4 November 2013"," 30 Days of Mayhem
","30 Days of Night An isolated town in Alaska is preparing for the annual ""30 Days of Night"" when the sun is below the horizon for an entire month. The film begins by focusing on Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) the town's sheriff investigating a series of crimes which all seemed to be attempts to cut off the town's communication and means of travel. Following these events, a large gang of brutal, ruthless vampires began to strategically massacre the town. Eben and his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) lead a small group of survivors to hide from the vampires until the sun comes back up. After almost a month of hiding Eben realizes the only way for the survivors to live is to fight back and it becomes a struggle of good versus evil.<br/><br/>The major theme of the movie is good versus evil, which is displayed through symbolic imagery and camera angles, specifically to emphasize light and dark images in the cinematography. This is very similar to the movie 28 days later, in which symbolic imagery and camera angles are also used to represent a struggle between good versus evil.<br/><br/>Very specific camera angles and black/white imagery symbolize evil throughout the film. The main symbol of this evil is the 30 days of night which represents the 30 days of evil they experience. The scenes leading up to the 30 days of night make it seem like a very ominous time of year as people rush to leave before they miss the last flight out of town for the month and wide camera angles are used to show how isolated the area they are in actually is. Even though the camera angles make the audience feel very secluded, the scenes in the film are bright day scenes with lots of white snow, which represents the good spirits of the people and once the night comes all of the scenes are very shadowy and eerie. Once it is dark, the camera angle is in such a way that rooms appear dim and shadowy, which sets the mood for the film. More symbolic imagery is utilized with the vampires, who are all dressed in black clothing and their eyes are black, which is not a usual trait of vampires in most films today. It makes them seem much more sinister than the traditional vampire of today's films, who are romanticized and have human characteristics. When a person is turned, they remain themselves for a while until the black completely covers their eyes and they turn into evil, losing any goodness they once had. The darkness in the scenes and imagery surrounding these creatures make them out to be pure evil. The townspeople who are there have hope because of the snow- an element they feel they overcome and embrace, so the white snow becomes a symbol of hope. They choose to move between buildings during the whiteouts, as their cover, but these scenes of white are very symbolic of the good trying to overcome the evil or darkness. One of the most memorable scenes from the film was the overhead shot of the vampires brutally attacking the people of the town. The camera angle in this part of the film displays all of the killing and death happening. It shows how large scale the attack is, as 30 or so vampires massacre the town and quickly the once white snow becomes covered in red, symbolizing loss of purity and the death this evil will bring. Once the daylight returns, it goes back to wide camera angles and bright white snow, now that the evil and darkness have been defeated. This film is a more dramatic version of the traditional good versus evil theme we see in most vampire films, focusing on symbolic imagery and camera angles to demonstrated how much more evil this particular version of a vampire is."

","I thought the movie was very good. The storyline is compelling, the atmosphere - realistic, and, most importantly, the movie does a fairly good job staying away from cheese and clichés, which are present in most vampire movies.<br/><br/>The things that, in my opinion, were not perfect: <br/><br/><ul><li>They could've developed the characters a bit more (including the vampires!).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Stranger was a very interesting character, but we never get to learn much about it, or see any of the activity he engages in prior to the vampires' arrival (it is employed that it's him who prepared the city for the vampires by destroying cell phones, killing dogs, etc.). they could've found a more interesting use for him throughout the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There was no need for THAT much gore.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The vampires were TOO aggressive for my liking. I guess they were supposed to be that way, but I found it slightly over-the-top.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The lead actors don't look realistic for their roles. Josh looks like he's just stepped down from a Calvin Klein underwear ad poster, but, unlike his female counterpart, he CAN act. The girl also looks like a catwalk model, and she is EXTREMELY unconvincing as a law enforcement officer. Just wrong for this particular role.</li></ul><br/><br/>Basically, the movie could've have been better had they placed more emphasis on the characters and the story, rather than just filling every frame with gore, running vampires and screaming humans. And it would've DEFINITELY be much better if they replaced the lead actors with some realistic-looking people -- these were too ""glamorous"" to pull off such roles. <br/><br/>That's about it. All in all, the movie is actually very good. Would definitely watch again, and recommend to those interested in this genre."

","Highly entertaining vampire film with a great premise, there's no where to run! ""30 Days of Night"" in a way is a vampire version of ""The Thing,"" at least in it's setting, the isolated town of Barrow, Alaska, where many of the residents are packing up & leaving for the winter. A ship becomes ice locked in the Arctic Ocean & a colony of vampires converge on the towns remaining residents. What ensues is a game of cat & mouse, as the vampires feed off of one resident after another, until only a few remain.<br/><br/>The cold bleak isolated setting definitely puts a chill to this film, & you'd actually think it was filmed in Alaska, but was filmed in New Zeeland! No matter, the setting is perfect for blood thirsty vampires feasting through the long night, 30 days of it, until the sun rises, & then the nomadic vampires move on. The vampires their selves are well done, & their Slavic Eastern European accents along with their brutal almost pack like behavior, only serves to make them more menacing, but the remaining few of the towns residents are not going to give up without a fight, & fight they do! <br/><br/>To say much more would be giving to much of the story away. If you like ample amounts of dread, suspense, & survival of the fittest, all set in one of the most dismal places you could hope to survive, then ""30 Days of Nights"" is your sleigh ride to cold blooded horror."

","I was first seduced into vampire movies by the old Hammer ones of the 60s and early 70s. Of course, those creatures were depicted as basically Dracula clones (if not the Count himself). These vampires were usually extremely vile with no redeeming qualities, whatsoever.<br/><br/>Come the late 70s, starting with Frank Langella's depiction of Count Dracula, the viewing public was presented with a more romantic version of Bram Stoker's creation. Of course, there was the occasional foray into the old-style vampire in movies such as ""Nosferatu"" and ""Near Dark"". But, in the 80s, with ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", we were faced once again with a somewhat sympathetic and definitely romantic Dracula. In the 90s, for the most part, vampires are creatures to be pitied (as they can't even handle werewolves) and are constantly falling for human females and seem to spend their time lamenting the fact.<br/><br/>In ""30 Days of Night"", you find a return to the very nasty creatures... not to mention, totally unromantic and well organised. In what I believe was an nod to the novel ""Dracula"", they arrive near Barrow, Alaska on a ship (something like the Count's arrival in England on the ship, the Demeter. The Stranger even acts the part of Renfield, sabotaging the town, preparing for the creatures' arrival.<br/><br/>The vampires seem to be a family group, led by an elder. The language they speak seems Slavic, which fits them right into the Dracula mythos. There is less than a dozen of them but they are able to kill almost everybody in the town. The sheriff, played by Josh Hartnett, works tirelessly to help the survivors last through the month. These vampires are very difficult to kill and the sheriff has to resort to using an axe on several occasions because beheading them seems to be the only sure way. Some of the survivors are killed, usually when they are heroically trying to help others but sometimes when the group is moving to safer places to hide.<br/><br/>Hartnett's character sacrifices himself by injecting tainted blood into his veins, as he sees the vampires are burning down the town to hide their crimes. He is able to kill the elder vampire in his half-vampire state, causing the rest of the monsters to leave. He and his wife then watch the sunrise and he turns to ash, paying for the safety of his fellow survivors with his life.<br/><br/>I know that this has been more of a synopsis but I did it this way to tell you why I liked the film so much. The homage to the one of the better vampire novels, the real terror of what seems like an endless night and the minimalist, but effective, use of make up, and the excellence of the writing and acting was why I rated this film so high.<br/><br/>I believe I will add this film to my DVD collection and I suggest anyone having a chance to see it: do so. You won't be disappointed."

","I thought before I saw ""30 Days of Night"", I'd just be seeing another pathetic attempt at a good vampire film. But I was pretty much wrong. I really enjoyed it in the end thanks to help from good old Sam Raimi, who was a producer. It's based off of a graphic novel series, which is also good, and revolves around a flock of vampires attacking Barrow, Alaska during its 30 days of night period. Only the sheriff(an acceptable Josh Hartnett) and his wife(Melissa George) can lead a small group of survivors to safety and hope they can survive for the month of darkness. I liked how the vampires got their own weird language and Danny Huston was a good choice as the vampire leader. The movie will also please gore fans with tons of bloody violence. But the problem is it switches between various days of the month too quickly and that adds to some annoying plot jumping. But I'd still see the film again and hopefully they'll make a sequel like in the graphic novels(they kind of set up the idea that there will be a second ""30 Days"")."
"soulassassinx","8","2","3","17 February 2008"," The Time of Day
","I'm the kind of person who takes the myth around vampires very lightly. To me vampires are somewhat ridiculous. To me vampires are boring brats like those in Interview with a vampire or plain silly like in the RPG The Masquerade; artsy wanna-bes and nerds with to much free time on their hands, all sexually deviant and not particularly scary, often portrayed a supermodels with light-blue eyes and bad make up.<br/><br/>Had it not been for my friend who highly recommended Thirty days of night, a friend who's equally unimpressed by the modern vampire-myth, I'd probably wouldn't give this the time of day and then a third vampire hater, stepped in a recommended it strongly.<br/><br/>For the first time I hated the vampires, so much I wanted them to die. The vampires in this movie aren't cool or exotic or sympathetic in that charming way, that seems to attract vampire-lovers.<br/><br/>You are going to love these vampires as much as you love Ralph Fiennes Kommandant Amon Göth in Schindler's List.<br/><br/>These vamps are, in every sense, nasty unlikable, disgusting, weird and utterly scary, just like a vampire should be.<br/><br/>So they come by boat to feed of the population of Barrow, an Alaskan small town, a place where no person ever seems to joke or smile. They're forced to live, once a year, in perpetual darkness during the winter. <br/><br/>The real interesting take on the vampires is that they have their own language and move like starved, rabid animals.<br/><br/>They don't seem to have a masterplan for world domination or being part of a conspiracy, they're just there and the way they look will scare most people. Their facial features is like something out of a David Lynchian nightmare.<br/><br/>I like that this is a mystery, not an action movie and the only other scary vampire movie in modern times is Shadow of the Vampire, a movie almost as scary.<br/><br/>But I can hear my vampire-loving friends bring this down, since the vamps didn't play spinette, spoke with eastern European accents and moaned like the best sex they've ever had every time they sink their teeth into jugulars.<br/><br/>They don't even seem to be enjoying themselves. There is one more movie that comes to mind and that The Addiction, where vampyrism also seem to be more of a decease like alcoholism or bulimia.<br/><br/>It does contain some pretty violent scenes like the massacre on the dogs, the gunplay and decapitations that look almost too realistic.<br/><br/>The entire movie for that matter has the same feel like 28 days later or Cloverfield.<br/><br/>I have never hated vampires more, but this time for a legit reason. <br/><br/>Some scenes fails to deliver but they are very few."
"thesandfly77","8","2","3","15 January 2008"," 30 Ways To Fright(en)...groan...
","Now this is how to do it.<br/><br/>I came to this film late, seeking an antidote for the tepid morass that was I Am Legend. And how I found it!<br/><br/>Thank you. a refreshing and invigorating take on a well-worn legend. The plot you'll be aware of so I won't take up time with a summary. I'll concentrate on the qualities this little gem possesses in abundance.<br/><br/>1) Intensity. It reminded me, due to setting but also the intensity of some set-pieces, of The Thing. A good Thing (sic, apologies.) The tension is cranked up and left taut. <br/><br/>2)It is totally Uncompromising. Although a gore-fest in many places, do not let that put you off. The reluctance to bow to the political correctness of many modern-day horrors or ease up on the relentless peril the protagonist and his band of depleting survivors face which the movie exudes is an incredibly admirable trait in today's market place of redemption and faux nicety.<br/><br/>The vampire clan here are no lost children of the Lord, they're downright feral and as similar a species to humanity as we are to the ape. There is neither the sense of pity, romance or longing invested in these creatures; a point worth noting the quality of acting by those playing them - not easy to pull off, and with potential to edge into cheese as we've seen before in countless lesser productions but a balance is nicely struck between animal aggression and intelligent darkness. Kudos to those involved in pitching it just right for necessary suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>3) The Acting. As mentioned above, the vampires work very well, but so to do the survivors. Josh Hartnett was a convincing joy as the troubled, heroic Sheriff and each minor part was filled out to the max. Of course credit to the director for encouraging such quality of performance.<br/><br/>4) Cliché Management. Predictably in many other reviews of this, particularly the negative ones, the word cliché is thrown around like water at a 4 year old's summer birthday party involving a pool a lawn and copious water-pistol armament. Well, stop it now. Perhaps too many people fall upon clichés themselves when searching for the necessary language to compose reviews like this. I'd like to make a valid point here: When dealing with the horror/vampire genre the cliché, be it written, spoken, or visual is UNAVOIDABLE. Got that, moaners? <br/><br/>With any project like this, the management of the cliché is what is most important. And, with every man and his dog (see, a small cliché there) having an opinion/take on the vampire legend it's all a movie can do to put up convincing arguments both for and against convention. And I think this film does so with aplomb and no apology.<br/><br/>5) THE END. I've warned of possible spoilers but I'll try not to express any plot points here. Of course any smart kid with a Pc can declare on here that he/she KNEW such and such was going to happen. But as a veteran of these B-movie homages I can honestly hold up my 40 year-old hands and say the climax was a genuine pleasure, a genuine surprise and in no way signaled throughout the film.<br/><br/>It is the icing on the cake and closes off a tense, harrowing hour and 40 minutes of creeping dread in a unique way that does stamp this movie as different from the pack - not totally unique but certainly outstanding - and well worth your time. <br/><br/>In summary: It is savage, grim, gory, brutal and painful to watch at times but that's all positive when dealing with a new take on the genre. You'll wince and grimace and breath fast and your heart will race as you feel the tension. And that's quite a feat for a modern-day vampire flick.<br/><br/>I marked this 8 mainly because its brimming with gore, perhaps - and this is but a light criticism - overtly in some places. But you got to please the teenage crowd as well as offering plenty of intellectual engagement for those seeking more. <br/><br/>Also, I would have liked a bit more exposition on the nature of the vampires and their origins but that is maybe a very good sign - that the film held me enough for my curiosity to go along for the ride and left me wanting more. Yeah, add another half point, lol.<br/><br/>Do watch this. For its genre,it's a diamond in the rough. It deserves your time far more than most gargantuan-budget blockbusters, and it will neither insult your intelligence or leave your expectations wanting. Thoroughly enjoyable."

","David Slade gives us a dark, depressing film that rivals the darkness of Tim Burton's original Batman, based on Steve Niles phenomenal graphic novel.<br/><br/>Our story is about the town of Barrow, Alaska preparing for their annual 30 Days of Night, where the sun won't come out for, you guessed it 30 days. But, when a stranger (very well played by Ben Foster) comes and sabotages the town,. Vampires start attacking, they are in some deep trouble.<br/><br/>I must vote this movie only and ""8/10"" because despite a great premise, great looking vampire, and more blood then Dracula can drink, the only thing that brought this film down was the fact that most of the vampires (besides it leader) only shrieked, that really annoyed me. All shrieks aside, this film made me feel like a vampire in a blood bank."

But also show to us how the people behavior in a situation like that one.<br/><br/>The cast is good, with Harnett playing a non typical hero and the vampires look really cool. The unique think that i don't like of the vampires was their strange eye browns; and the visual part of the film is really good.<br/><br/>I haven't read the comics so i can't compare to them. so the unique thing that i can say is that i really enjoy this film, is really well done and is a fresh film in the vampires genre. 8/10<br/><br/>PS: i love the end, is not typical because is not a happy one and i think that horror films will never be for everyone."

","Except for may-be Dracula (1932) this is the best vampire film I've seen.Too long now have vampires been portrayed as sensual beautiful creatures instead of the throat-ripping beasts they deserve to be wrote as. These baddies in this film 30 Days of Night are the scariest vampires since Nosferatu & Kurt Barlow from Salem's lot (1979 CBS version,not the lame ass Sci-Fi network Rob Lowe remake). These were extremely terrifying in their displays of viscousness &complete disregard of mercy as they brutalized this small town of 150 =. One of my all time fav camera shots came from this film as the cameras has an angle shooting down from the sky as if you're in the air & looking down you see the town trying to defend itself but to no avail as the blood starts coating the snow white ground & you see it's everywhere. Very disturbing & haunting but AWESOME! Ididn't really like the lead casting of Josh Hartnett as the Sheriff character but he did okay.I also liked the infected are turned part of the storyline as it was reminiscent of azombie film this way. Also loved the mouth full of razor sharp teeth. They definitely killed any interest one might have in a fantasy sorta way about one wanting to turn into a vampire.

","Barrow is an Alaskan town that is plunged into darkness for 30 days every 12 months. Whilst the townspeople are prepared for this what they hadn't banked on was a group of blood thirsty vampires who start to take the residents out one by one...<br/><br/>30 Days Of Night is simplistic and old-fashioned in terms of its approach; vampires arrive and start killing people one by one leaving a trail of bodies and pools of blood in their wake. What this all leads to its a fairly pacey film with plenty of unpretentious thrills and spills. Director David Slade does a really good job here; the vampires are seemingly unstoppable and this creates a sense of peril for the remaining survivors as they try to figure out how to overthrow their much stronger and faster adversaries.<br/><br/>Although it provides plenty of gore and old-school thrills there are a few problems with the film; for a start, there's no real backstory with the vampires; who are they? Where did they come from? At one point the leader of the vampires mentions they've been waiting for centuries for this, but why and where had they been? Another weak link lay with the characters; Hartnett is not the best of actors and doesn't do a great job in crafting out much of a character here (although I did warm more towards him as the film progressed). The other characters also failed to add much to the film making barely memorable contributions.<br/><br/>Still if you're just looking for some old-fashioned gore, thrills and 100 minutes of escapism then, despite some of my reservations, you should find plenty to enjoy about 30 Days Of Night."

","WOW what a fantastic & scary Horror movie this is!!!!
""30 Days of Night"" deserves to be double billed with John Carpenters The Thing!!!
""30 Days of Night"" is the best Vampire film ever made, it's a Horror that actually shows Vampires to be terrifying ferocious creatures & this film totally made Vampires terrifying again!!!
Also this film is a visual stylishly stunning treat with beautiful & eerie cinematography as well as a scary as hell raw icey-cold musical score that is truly haunting & very unnerving.<br/><br/>This is also the great underrated Josh Hartnett's best movie & Role, here he gives one fine solid leading man performance!!!
As i said this Wintertime Horror made vampires absolutely terrifying again!!! like primal beasts hunting it's prey, the scariest vampires I've ever seen so far in a vampire movie...Ever!!!
The vampires look scary as hell & the bleak snowbound setting is really unsettling especially when it gets dark for 30 days of night!!!
This also has the best lead performance given by the underrated ""Josh Hartnett"" who i think is a cool guy & a great lead ever since seeing him in Halloween H20 (1998), The Faculty (1998) & Black Hawk Down (2001) he was great in those movies but has also been in alot of terrible films, he is excellent here as the sheriff of this little winter town in Alaska. Here Josh plays it very serious & intense & his performance comes off completely believable as you can see the fear in his eyes!!!
Sheriff Eban is A great character for a Horror movie.
The rest of the cast are all great like ""melissa George"" who is a strong tough female lead here & the always intense & creepy ""Ben Foster"" who is very scary here!!!
The Atmosphere is very intense it's got that isolated ""John Carpenter"" feel to it that filled his movies with dread & works perfectly here, think of two ""Carpenter"" films mixed together with
""The Thing"" & ""Vampires"" & that's the kind of Horror this is, the atmosphere & mood is dark & creepy.
Now this may not be an absolute Masterpiece & the ending didn't play out how i would've liked but it's definitely Excellent & deserves to be a Cult Classic in the future!!!<br/><br/>This is a blast of a brutal & violent vampire frenzy survival Horror film,
It's also a blood soaked splatter fest with real looking fake blood spilling out all the over the place like the old school Horror films we grew up watching & loving.
The setting is cold snowy & bleak, then comes nightfall & then comes the vampires & then it's full on survive the nights & fight till the end.
A scary thrill ride Horror Thriller,
Gritty,brutal,Raw & scary makes this one of the best vampire movies ever made!!! Up there with ""The Lost Boys"" ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" & ""Vampires""
Yes ""30 Days of Night"" is a superb, Thrilling & intense Horror movie with bursts of savage violence & blood splattered action!!!
A real scary blast of Horror & Action."

","Surprisingly good, but not a movie that would be considered a classic. However this does stand above a lot of the more mediocre Vampire movies that have been made.<br/><br/>It almost entirely relies on atmosphere, the coldness of the nomadic vampires is only matched by the Alaskan wilderness. The story works quite well, especially as there is never really any back story to tell where the vampires actually come from. The ending is quite well done and because it isn't really a happy ending I count it as a plus. Happy endings seem to be the go and having one that is not so happy is a welcome change. The movie is let down by some of the acting, which, if better might have made this a classic.<br/><br/>Very much worth a watch if you like Vampire movies."
"wogsurfer","8","1","1","27 May 2017"," The most visceral vampire movie I ever saw.
","Barrow, Alaska. The most northern town in America, where for 30 days every year it is has no sunlight.<br/><br/>This is the perfect opportunity for a gang of merciless, & blood- thirsty vampires to feed on the remaining inhabitants of this small town, after most leave for the month of darkness.<br/><br/>As people are leaving, and others are making preparations for their time of hibernation, mysterious occurrences are uncovered; mobile phones stolen, and destroyed, an entire team of sled dogs butchered. The ground work for the impending doom of a malevolent force.<br/><br/>Once the killings and feedings begin there is no let up. I have watched my share of vampire films, and frankly this is definitely one of the best made, its stripped back, bare, and unromanticized. This group of vampires, led by the visceral Marlow (Houston) take no pity on the town of Barrow as they tear it apart looking for their prey, and using people as bait to lure hiding survivors out into the cold and snowed out streets of the isolated mining town.<br/><br/>The second half of the film becomes a tale of survival, as town Sheriff Eben Olemun (Hartnett) and his soon to be ex-wife Stella (George), lead a group of survivors who manage to hide themselves away by staying in an attic, scared and cold they realize that it is only a matter of time before they are discovered and killed.<br/><br/>Even though this is a film that does involve a fair amount of blood and gore, the film's real heart lies in the way it scares you with what it doesn't show in the lead up to the early killings, this for me is true horror, show me next to nothing, and build the most amount of tension, then deliver the shock, and you'll have me pissing my pants every time. There is also a fair amount of brutality shown, not only in how the vampires kill their prey, but also how they are dispensed by Eben and the others.<br/><br/>On an interesting note, this is a film based on a graphic novel written by Steve Niles, who co-wrote the screenplay to the film. Niles had actually pitched the original idea as a film some years before, but reworked it to graphic novel after being knocked back by several producers, it was then picked up afterwards by one of those producers to make this film we have now."

That village is perfect for a terror movie.<br/><br/>And the final scene is epic, after 90 minutes of rampant action, a little lovely scene.<br/><br/>The only negative thing, is the chemistry between the characters.<br/><br/>If i had to define in a dictionary ""horror movie"", 30 days of night would be the perfect example.<br/><br/>Epic."

","30 Days Of Night pulls no punches, let's get that clear right off that bat. This ain't no ponderous, moody vampire flick, it's a visceral, gut ripping fever dream of cold dread. The vampires are ferocious, almost alien like demons, and you don't even see them coming, until your jugular is raining down onto the snow. Once a year, a small Alaskan ttown is plunged into wintery darkness for an entire month. This time around, a pack of bloodthirsty vampires has arrived on a decimated freighter ship, to set up camp and terrorize every soul in the town. Sheriff Eben Olsen (Josh Hartnett) findsnthe wreckage and arrests a mysterious stranger, played by Ben Foster. Foster adopts a greasy persona and an indecipherable eastern European accept, and is at times creepier than the vamps. When night descends, the vamps invade, in some nerve shattering sequences of horror. They don't discriminate either... Kids, dogs and anyone they find is immediate prey. Olsen and his family, including ex wife Melissa George, must hunker down, evade and survive the monsters until the sun shows its face again in a months time. Danny Huston plays Marlow, the leader of the pack, with godlike malice, and Mark Boone Jr. shows up as an intrepid townsman. It's a pulse pounding flick to sit through, even for horror buffs, but works very well due to its murky, desolate atmosphere and absolutely ruthless scenes of terror."

He ends up killing not only his best friend but another one of his friends by chopping their head off with an ax with such little emotion shown besides a slight teary-eyed look. He never really shows how much he wishes none of this had happened. <br/><br/>Besides the quite bad acting, the gore and make-up is quite well done. I don't regret watching it since it was decent."

","Set in Barrow, Alaska, this next-generation zombie/vampire flick is about a strange group that visit during the month of darkness to terrorize the town. Ben Foster is once again chilling in his role (much like his stellar performance in 3:10 To Yuma) and the rest of the cast does a good enough job to not completely ruin the movie. The far north setting is kind of cool but the small village gets a bit stifling after awhile. The story gets very repetitive, is a bit shallow, does not develop characters, and is lacking in background explanation. This can work to a movie's advantage sometimes, like in The Strangers , but this method doesn't work well in this case. Certain special effects are not very appealing, such as the creatures faces and the last scene with Josh Hartnett and Melissa George (you'll have to watch to find out). This movie is best relegated for Halloween or a full-moon night when any decent horror movie will do."

","I have a mixed opinion on this film. I liked the plot and all the scenes where the vampires were present. That accounts for my summary title. What I like most about the plot is that in most vampire movies the victims only need to hold out until dawn. This film had the unique plot of having to survive for a month.<br/><br/>The vampire characters were great and the unique language they spoke added to the horror by further dehumanizing them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the human actors didn't fare as well. In my opinion Josh Hartnett is equal on the actor evolutionary scale with Keanu Reeves. I don't have a higher opinion of the female lead Melissa George either. Most of the other ""human"" actors were of the same caliber. <br/><br/>Perhaps Bill Pullman & Laura Linney in the leads would have improved the flow of the film.<br/><br/>This movie could have been so much better than it is, but is still an entertaining horror film."

","I read the book first then watched the movie. The movie follows the book well. I enjoyed watching the movie come together from start to finish even though I had a good insight on what to expect.<br/><br/>The movie leaves you thinking about what you might do in a place where your cut off from the rest of the world. Could you manage to remain calm in the dark for 30 days? The characters were interesting and this does contain your classic Hollywood vamps you see in other movies. This will be a good horror movie to watch for those who are looking for something a little different. Its got a little action and suspense with a twist of dark romance."

","It got to around the half way mark before I realised what had been bugging me all the way through the film. I pretty much sat thinking; this film isn't bad, so why aren't I excited or scared or willing the characters on? I finally realised it was because I didn't care about the characters in the film whatsoever. Now the idea is brilliant, the effects and make up are great, the cast is good and the script isn't bad, its just that the characters are so flat, I don't care what happens to them.<br/><br/>I really wanted this film to be good, I'd heard a lot of people telling me that it was a great re-telling of a movie monster classic. However, because there is little establishment at the start and practically no development throughout the film, you're watching flat 2D characters walk around on screen for 108 minutes, without much rhyme or reason.<br/><br/>If I were recommending vampire films to people, this would not be on the top of the list, I would much rather watch the likes of Dusk Till Dawn or Blade."
"rlange-3","7","1","1","31 March 2008"," Very spooky, entertaining horror movie
","I love horror, I don't like gore. This movie had plenty of both, and the fact I rated it this highly is a tribute to the all around excellence of the acting, the production values, and the unique location in Barrow, Alaska. <br/><br/>Unfortunately there are also a number of flaws which keep this one well down from a top rating. Fortunately, most of them are stuffed into the last quarter of the film.<br/><br/>Good - We didn't get a lot of vampire mythology. They weren't glorified or turned into hip objects of admiration. All that made them far more believable as a force of heartless evil. It would be so easy to go over the top in portraying the evil but this film does a great job of not throwing a lot of unnecessary emo into the vamps. Excellent job.<br/><br/>The setting is superb. Cinematography first rate. Crane scene breathtaking. It seems a bit warm most of the time for the season but that's quibbling. <br/><br/>The 'heroes/heroines' are played well and most importantly not overplayed. This is not a movie where one guy stands there blazing away with automatic weapons in both hands while dozens of bad guys fall dead. It's quite believable in terms of the outcomes of fights, up until the end. The ""conversion"" of the children was especially eerie.<br/><br/>Bad - Some of the survival decisions made by the dwindling group of humans seem rather... bone headed. It's not clear why they could not have weaponed up a bit more. It wouldn't have taken much to have the rugged mountain man saw the barrel of his shotgun down, for example. If ""UV lamps"" worked like magic phasers, why wouldn't they have taken some back to the power station? There seemed to be no plan at all for interior defense. Surely the middle aged woman had the guts to wield a weapon, but I don't recall her having a gun. etc etc.<br/><br/>Awful - Good grief, the last ten minutes just about flushed the whole movie down the commode. They are a couple hours away from daylight and the Sheriff does what??? Then he goes off and fights the leader of the vamps while they all stand around and watch??? And his wife, instead of running like she's supposed to just walks up to them??? huh? The ridiculous melodrama with the sunrise just caps off a sequence of pure schlock. <br/><br/>If the whole movie had been like the last ten minutes this would indeed have deserved a 1. It's too bad they couldn't have found a better way to end it other than this near comical series of ruinously improbable events."
"Sausage_Demon","8","1","1","25 March 2008"," About time
","First thing I have to say is this, to those people who hurl insults and accusations at the cast and crew of this film. Give them a break, first off, it is a vampire film, to all those hoping to see Shakespeare when you sat in the theater deserve to be disappointed. Second of all, saying that the Director should be fired or that they should get a REAL Director to do the film is down right uncalled for, clearly those people have no idea what it takes to make a film, how hard it is and not just that, they have to make it on a budget and within a time frame, and perhaps there were places they could have done better, or things they could have done differently but so what? To throw these insults at those involved with making this film I assume that the insulters have never made a bad working decision in their life, nor have they ever performed under 100% of their capability and have always done their work with 100% dedication and passion, because if they don't meet those assumptions then I guess they deserve to be fired too and replaced by a real employee.<br/><br/>Now rant over, on to the film.<br/><br/>At times the logic falls through, and there is no real sense of time passing, and the on screen notification of time passing is jumpy and the film feels like it takes place all in one night. At times the characters appear wooden, though I feel this is out of style than out of poor acting/writing. So, it is starting to sound like a regular horror film at this point, however it is the monsters of this film that set it apart from the run of the mill horror trash, as well as the cinematography.<br/><br/>First off, the camera work was great, some really good shots show they took this film seriously and that does wonders for films in this genre, not all shaky low budget cam like Bloodrayne 2, and not boringly static like Underworld, the action too is shown more fully on screen as opposed to the standard shot tight cut fast, while there is some of it, for the most part you can see what is happening on screen just like they used to shoot movies.<br/><br/>The vampires are most impressive, recently Vampires have been portrayed as sexy, romantic, cool, etc. Thanks to Anne Rice, And the World of Darkness games and a slew of crappy games and films they are now a pop icon, people think it is cool to be them etc. What really stands out about these vampires is that they have at long last, been portrayed as the monsters they are. They are not romantic or sexy, they do not feel human emotion or even think the way we think, they are demonic monsters, not emo humans with fangs and super powers. However usually when a monster is portrayed as a monster they are also verging on the braindead (I am Legend) because people have this stupid idea that monsters are people too...rubbish, but in 30 days of night, they are not braindead, not merely animals, they are sentient beings, albeit alien from ourselves, who consciously and willingly do evil, that is what truly makes them monsters and that is why this is a truly good film for the horror genre and it would be good to sit all these emo kids down and show them this film, that the monsters they think are cool are not romantic sex symbols but actually demonic(take that word as you will) human hating monsters, not human disliking, but hating, there is no greater pleasure for them than killing us, truly monstrous."
"culmo80","7","1","1","9 March 2008"," Good Except for the Ending
","I thought this was a pretty unique take on the vampire story. I liked the feeling of hopelessness that you felt as you watched Barrow Alaska cut off from the world for 30 days. Just that alone is enough to make someone feel uncomfortable. Add in these brutal monsters and you've got a great setting for a horror film.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett did pretty well as the sheriff and the rest of the acting was good. The special effects (blizzards, snow, etc) were all pretty good as well.<br/><br/>The story is basically, that this town of Barrow Alaska which gets cut off for a month every year as it gets no sun at this time. On the last day before the darkness, the sheriff investigates a bunch of strange incidents, such as someone stole several cell and satellite phones and burned them. He then picks up a stranger who was accosting the waitress in the diner. He cryptically warns them of ""them"" and it isn't long after that the power goes out and then the attacks begin. They start slowly at first, at people on the outskirts of town. Then, these creatures just unleash hell.<br/><br/>Then, a small group of survivors must find a way to stay alive as they piece together who these brutal people are that are eating their neighbors. They must move around to different safe areas while avoiding the vampires.<br/><br/>There were a few problems with the plot that I found. The first was during the first night of the attacks, Josh Hartnett is moving around town with little trouble. This after a scene of the vampires chasing down people in the streets. How's he moving around, in a truck, without being attacked? Then there are the people hiding in the diner. In that same scene of the vampires attacking the people, you see them breaking into houses and stores...so why weren't they breaking into the diner which seemed to be near the center of the town.<br/><br/>The head vampire periodically gives random speeches to his brethren in some sort of language and some of what he said just was like it was taken straight out of Nietzsche, ""that which can be broken should be broken"" and so forth.<br/><br/>(major spoiler here) When Josh Hartnett injects himself with the vampire blood, he says ""I can smell your blood."" Wouldn't the vampires be able to sense or smell these survivors even if they were hiding in an attic or a general store? Speaking of the ending, I didn't really like it. Yes I know, it was a throwback to his earlier speech about ""doing anything for family member"" but I just felt him becoming a vampire to fight the head vampire was a little too much. I also thought that the vampires would have simply all attacked him at once. I thought it would have been better had he followed the vampires back to their ship or wherever they were hiding and either joined them or destroyed them. Ah, but why not leave it open to endless sequels like every other horror film! Overall, it was a good film. There were a few moments early on that made me jump. It would have been nice to explain the backstory a little bit. Was the stranger a member of the crew on that cargo ship and how did that cargo ship get there. It was obviously frozen in place so they were there for a while. Also, the vampires wore pretty modern clothes and they looked like they came from different parts of the world. Maybe in the sequel, they'll explain that...and you know they will make a sequel...they always make sequels."
"addicott","7","1","1","6 March 2008"," The visuals are more memorable than the story.
","I enjoyed this film as a quick empty-calories excursion. I was very impressed by the look and mood throughout. Kudos to the cinematographer for lots of very powerful, stark images. This isolated Arctic town is a pretty cool setting for a yarn like this - very original.<br/><br/>Alas, the story didn't knock me out the way was hoping it might. With an elemental struggle like this one, there's plenty of dramatic potential. That makes it all the more disappointing when said potential isn't realized. I'm assuming that the graphic novel was way hip but this movie feels like it lost its way somewhere at one of the script meetings.<br/><br/>But then, I wasn't expecting Shakespeare. So I give it a 7. It didn't sweep me off my feet but I was entertained. Josh Hartnett was very solid, by the way (though maybe a bit young for a sheriff)."
"Dragonsouls","7","1","1","3 March 2008"," Above average acting for a Vampire slasher flick
","I saw the movie with high expectations due to all the hoopla amongst fans of the vampire genre and horror movies overall. I found that I enjoyed the movie for what it was a little bit more during the 2nd viewing. I understood the ending a bit more, some people might not like the ending, but I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>Acting by Hartnett and supporting cast was satisfying and enough for integrity's sake, but the true stars were the ghoulish and demonic looking vampires who showcase some super speed and agility in this film. The make-up is astonishing, and jaw dropping. I loved the rubber suits from Underworld, but this is just twisted stuff. There was good tension and the vampires made for an imposing looking bunch and even a bit disturbing for that matter. Gone is the eloquence and vanity and here you will see a whole new vampire, sort a vampire/zombie mix, but very intelligent and even philosophical at some times.<br/><br/>There are no cheap jumpy scenes here, and gore is held to a minimum until the end. Director David Slade did a decent job, nothing spectacular. He had big help from the big B movie budget and beautiful atmosphere created by the expansive set of a whole town. I just thought Slade used some western film noir and could have done a better job with some pacing elements of the plot.<br/><br/>The end will leave you with some questions and some will say you are left hanging at the end and it is likely that another sequel will be produced shortly since this film was successful in box office. There is no doubt that you will remember this film for a while after seeing it."
"kmeyer57","7","1","1","2 March 2008"," Wasn't bad, but needed better direction
","A fairly original take on vampires given the drivel that's been passed out for the last several years (Dracula 2000, anyone?). Some decent scares, creepy ambiance, and surprisingly good acting (I generally despise Josh Hartnett, but he really didn't suck). The casting was typical Hollywood young & beautiful. I thought they missed an opportunity to show some new faces, especially native Alaskans/Innuits.<br/><br/>What I think keeps this from being a top-tier horror flick is the pacing. It just didn't flow well. There was a missed opportunity to highlight the isolation, claustrophobia and tedium of the character's situation, something nailed perfectly in the film's obvious progenitor, The Thing."
"jzappa","9","1","1","19 January 2008"," Don't Be Short-Changed By Personality Over Character
","There's a quote I recently read by the author W. Somerset Maugham. ""When you choose your friends, don't be short-changed by choosing personality over character."" 30 Days of Night seems to have been made by and will likely be enjoyed the most by people who have not read this quote or have come to a conclusion relative to Maugham's. However, can you blame them so much? This film appears to be a ground-breaker in its own right. It has some of the most striking and beautifully Gothic cinematography I have ever seen. It is so bleak in a way that is somehow inventive. I've never seen a film before this that has looked this way or similarly enough to it to be reminiscent. The photography is no doubt the film's most valuable quality.<br/><br/>It's the film's look that gives it's small-town Alaska setting such atmosphere, such an all- consuming limitation that makes it feel so cut off from the rest of America. Would anyone here in Cincinnati find it plausible that vampires could take the town over? Surely somehow they could be overpowered. Not in this town, which is given a spotlit weakness by its wondrously atmospheric appearance in this film.<br/><br/>Even if it's hard to believe that with a well-populated town, vampires intelligent enough to have Danny Huston as a leader would rampage and kill everybody rather than rounding them up and feed to their satisfaction, the relentlessness of the vampires and their unyielding ruthlessness accompanied by the filmmakers' willingness to stay with scenes of horrible torture, screaming, brutality, and depressingly sad scenes of gore, and how little the script cares to let minor characters go, and go in merciless ways only those who've survived some of the world's most horrific atrocities will feel they've seen any semblance of in witnessing death before, gives the film great intensity and suspense. But if it only could not go limp on us in the last 20 minutes, when the screenwriters, instead of climbing off for a smoke break, simply ran out of breath and let the pounding get weaker and drone on till the satisfied but rather flimsy finish.<br/><br/>Those last twenty minutes or so haven't the meaning or effort as such dense tissue like the rest of the movie up till then, even though the entire time it's rather difficult to overlook how characters can hide from their relentless predators when every step should make a footprint in the snow, when it tapers off into implausibility in the context of its own creative license, not to mention silly American tough-guy-going-down-and-taking-as- many-of-them-with-me-as-I-can gimmickry. (For example, injecting oneself with vampire blood is a completely pointless act when it's fifteen minutes before sun-up.) Nonetheless, I still somehow did not leave this film reflecting upon it with such bad taste in my mouth. I don't look at it as a ground-breaker and certainly not a contemporary classic, but the inspired stylistic intensity in the film-making, responsibility for which can be taken by director David Slade, who also directed the seamless, criminally overlooked gem of a thriller Hard Candy, will hopefully be built upon with Slade's following efforts."
"daizy-oz","8","1","1","24 December 2007"," Top movie
","I am a very big fan of vampire movies and it takes a lot to scare me or even get my heart racing in a film. This film however has succeeded in that. Not only were there times when my heart was racing but it even scared me a little, (although i was watching it in the dark). One main thing i love about this movie was the look of the vampires. Every vampire movie theses days is the same old story with the same looking vampires, congratulations to the make up artists on this film as it adds to the scare! Another reason this film is so good it the fact that you are not entirely certain what these creatures are in the beginning. It is a while before you visually see the face of the vampire, and not knowing what is hunting, is scary. And thirdly the ending isn't your typical 'happy' main characters survive story. Although i am a fan of Josh Hartnett and would of liked him to survive, the heroic ending definitely made the movie. Of course its good to see a bit of Australian in the movie too, i thought both actor/actress played a good role. Hats off the the Director and Producer as well as i thought the dramatic and artistic aspects of the film were well done."

","I felt the need to enable an account in order to respond to my now realized utter indifference to the money I earn. Now...I was a little biased in that I am a fan of the comic. Keeping that in mind I had no anticipation of this ""motion picture"" bearing any resemblance to said book as the direction was not helm-ed by chris nolan or frank miller...the only directors/producers seemingly capable of translating a comic with dignity to the big screen. However...what is beginning to puzzle me is the following: to the best of my knowledge for something to be mediocre it has to be average. A ""C"" were we in high school. Now answer me this...HOW CAN SOMETHING SO F'ING MEDIOCRE BE SOO F'ING BAD? The plot, which I won't ""spoil"", seemed to be comprised of every generic device which are generally reserved as filler until a piece of effects-laden brutality wow the audience and make us giggle with sick delight and munch popcorn. I spent more time picking corn out of my teeth than taking mere moments of enjoyment from this trite excuse for an adaptation. It breaks down into several key components of suck. 1. Josh Hartnett is utterly incapable of emoting on screen. He plays callous characters quite well as in Sin City or even Lucky Number Slevin where the character has a heavy-hearted back story but doesn't really need to show that outside of intensity. 2. The aforementioned Hartnett is surrounded by a barrage of generally small-rolled actors desperately attempting to hold their heads above the proverbial blood-soaked water and fail to show anything that can generate more than a few sporadic laughs throughout the theater aimed at their inability to carry the scene. 3. This really should be the chief point. Who was it that felt the need to elaborate on anything outside of carnage engorging vampires in a month of darkness and snow? That's all I asked for. Ripping corpses, adrenaline fueled failed attempts at escape, and a hatred of garlic/silver/Jesus or whatever is fashionable to thwart vampires this year. No...just sequences of re-hashed ""We can't stay here!"" moments followed by jump-cuts anytime there should be on screen grisly. I would rather watch Underworld. Think about that."
"ElijahCSkuggs","7","5","12","20 October 2007"," Screeching vampires get old....
","I have been a ""30 days"" fan for a while now, as well as a fan of Steve Niles who consistently writes entertaining horror comics; needless to say, I was very much stoked to see this film. Of course though, i did catch wind of some reviews and was forewarned that this may be a vampyrrhic meltdown...and in some cases it was.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett plays the lead Eben, not Evan, who is having relationship issues with his wife Stella, played by the too pretty to be taken seriously Melissa George, and as they are about to smooth things over, a stranger comes to town with some foreboding news. <br/><br/>It's not soon after this that Eben, his bro, his pothead granny, Stella, and a few other miscreants are running and hiding from a gang of Russian(?) nosferatus. <br/><br/>The blood flows pretty well in the film, as does the action, but there were a few times where I had to laugh and shake my head at some of the cliché plot turns/characters, ex: the old man who misses his dead wife and the worrisome guy who doesn't know how to shut the hell up!!! But the film had some nice direction from the HARD CANDY guy, and Josh Hartnett was actually pretty good. Its kind of fun to watch him lose his sanity.<br/><br/>But the film is saved by Danny Huston. He doesn't say much verbally in the film but his mouth and looks do a lot of talking on their own. He owns the film as the head vamp, with icy dead stares and a menacing gait, but the same cannot can be said about the rest of the bloodsuckers. They twist their heads constantly feeding like seizure victims, always show off their teeth to ill and un-scary effect, and do not stop screeching!!! Ever. Why do vampires need to screech? Ugh. <br/><br/>So all in all, nice cinematography at times(great shot of one bloody town), okay gore, bad ending, and too much screeching. I give it a wicked generous and lucky number sleven."

","I think we all know that Hartnett WAS an overrated actor in his day and has since then his name has been a bane to our eyes in the world of movies, but he's finally done something excellent and completely not in his acting type.<br/><br/>This is one of the best horror films I've seen and definitely the best vampire movie in my opinion. It is also one of the bloodiest movies out there and therefore the squeamish should stay away.<br/><br/>Don't think that this movie would be bad just because the last name ""Hartnett"" appears in the acting list. This is definitely his breakthrough performance that could put him back into the acting line, only he should probably stay to these kinds of movies just to be safe."
"reeves2002","10","4","9","3 November 2007"," One of the best films i've seen in a long time!
","I read many reviews and several articles in horror magazines about this movie to know that it was probably gonna be good.The trailer looked intriguing and it was a very anticipated movie.For the 1st time in a really long time here is a movie that I have not heard a lot of negative thing about until I read the idiotic comments on here.Some of them were ""I was amused by it"", ""vampires are supposed to be seductive"",or ""30 days of nothing""! Oh my God what is wrong with you haters? Who ever said vampires had to be seductive? I mean this isn't Dracula so stop comparing him with this completely different story.Whoever thought nothing happened in those 30 days obviously watched the wrong film because a lot happened ,and I did not find anything amusing about it. Surprisingly the majority of people who hated this film seem to be people from the UK. My advice to people that have not seen it is go see it for yourself and do not believe the horrible comments and insults.I think people just complain to complain.I found it very enjoyable and always appreciate a good horror film when I see one.I always go to a movie with an open mind and without expectations.But with this movie I expected a lot because of all the attention it got and the fact that for it's 1st(maybe 2nd) week here it was the number 1 movie at the box office. What I can say is that it exceeded my expectations and it was a good experience.I left the theater feeling very satisfied and thinking it was one of the best i've seen in years.It achieved everything they set out to do with it.It did manage to make vampires serious and scary again.This was a top notch horror with a very dark score and feel to it.It was realistic due to superb acting by the whole cast.Some of the actors I was seeing for the 1st time and hopefully not the last.Josh Hartnett did a brilliant job.There is not a dull moment in this movie and I enjoyed it from start to finish.It is the kind of movie where you can relate to the characters especially if you have ever lived in a smaller town or in a tight knit community.You actually cared about these characters and what happens to them because of how well they are portrayed.It had a very dark chilling atmosphere and a great location in New Zealand,and had awesome special effects,makeup and stunt work.This is hopefully how horror in the future will be more like although this will be hard to top. I have not heard of the comics or graphic novel's before seeing this movie but have found myself a fan of them now and want to purchase each of them.There is a lot more good stuff I could say about this movie but it sounds like by reading a lot of these comments they have already been said.This movie should be seen on the big screen for the ultimate experience.I give this movie a 10 out of 10."
"Robert_duder","9","4","9","27 October 2007"," An amazing spin on an old Genre with really incredible film making!!
","I've been hearing a lot about the poor turn out of films this fall but I could not disagree more because so far I have really had some good luck in watching some of the fall releases. I had so-so expectations going into 30 Days of Night and once again I was absolutely blown away as I was previously with the incredible ""We Own The Night"" (See my review), the silly ""Sydney White"" (See my review) and the far more serious and brilliantly acted ""Rendition"" (See my review.) So now it was time for some Horror action and it has been a long time since I've seen a really good horror flick and I used to be an obsessive fan of the genre. I love slasher flicks, the numerous sequels and the gore if it's done right and as far as I'm concerned 30 Days of Night does everything right!! You have the ultimate theme and setting of isolation being set in the Northern most part of Alaska in a small mining town that sees 30 Days of Night every winter. Most town folk clear out but for a few workers, police and die hard townspeople. The feel of the film with the wind blown snow and the darkness definitely draws you into this feeling of being completely cut off from the rest of the world and works perfectly. The real magic here is the film makers way of creating the vampire. Now we all know Vampires have just about been done in every which way by Hollywood and I won't say 30 Days Of Night takes it in a completely new direction but definitely unique and some terrific special effects. The monsters are downright terrifying and have this eerie look to them. Their language (Latin?) just adds to the realism and the fear you feel for these people and they are no holds barred BRUTAL!! <br/><br/>Josh Hartnett has had some good roles, although he's never really blown me away and it seems like he's had some issues with finding good strong adult roles but this might do it for him. I thought, having seen the trailers, that he was far too baby faced and immature to pull off being the lead guy in the role as the sheriff determined to save everyone but he actually does an excellent job. Sure it's no amazing acting feat but he keeps you riveted and gets his hands dirty and looks good doing it. Melissa George who I think does have some excellent acting ability plays Hartnett's estranged wife who ends up being stranded there as well in a freak coincidence (hey it's a horror movie.) I wouldn't describe her as the scream queen because she's far too strong to be that. Instead she turns in a very good strong female lead role that is to be reckoned with. Her and Hartnett have decent...so-so...chemistry but then it doesn't focus on that either. They don't take away from the main story to focus on romance. Ben Foster, hot on the heels of his very good performance in 310 to Yuma (see my review) plays a downright creepy stranger who tries to warn them of the impending doom but more to mock them then anything. I think he's pretty well found his niche in acting and might have a hard time finding anything else outside of that, although I remember him quite well from a teen flick called Get Over It where he played the good guy lead. I wish I had the space to break down supporting roles especially that of the vampires but I don't but I can tell you the supporting cast is terrific in their various roles and the vampire cast are all amazing and it's not just the special effects. Each one of them becomes very distinct in their style and character.<br/><br/>Yet another music video director turned Hollywood David Slade takes the helm and I have to give him a huge kudos because the cinematography in this film is just brilliant. The overhead scenes with the torturous blood shed was brilliant and breath taking, the dark and the white snow and the vampires and just everything is brilliantly filmed and really fascinating to watch. Unlike some former music directors turned Hollywood he doesn't fall into the trap of being all over the place with his shots...instead he carefully marks them out and makes it stunning to watch and very, very unique. Maybe the story isn't entirely thrilling or new to watch but it's really good and that's what's important. They don't rush the story...in fact they take time to set up the character and the town and the impending attack. They don't even throw the gore right into your face but they don't hide it either. They won't show you every time someone gets ripped apart so you're not expecting it the next time when they zoom in on an ax taking off someones head. I've read reviewers that complain the whole movie is about this small group moving from place to place and they are right because the movie is about survival!! Of course as with any Horror film you have to suspend a certain level of reality because otherwise you'd hate every fantasy film of any kind but for being what it is, it's not the far fetched or crazy with no glaring pot holes. All in all...until Saw IV rears it's head which I'm already salivating for...30 Days of Night is a deadly killer of a movie and a must see by fans of the genre or looking for a freakishly cool night out. 9/10"

I'm guessing this was done because they weren't supposed to be the seductive, beautiful vampires one usually sees in the movies, but bloodthirsty animals who are never sated, always looking for the next kill. Yes there was a lot of gore which usually turns me off, but the truly frightening thing about this movie was the feeling of being trapped that not only are the characters experiencing but the audience experiences as well. Josh Hartnett has completely redeemed himself in my eyes, (I haven't been able to watch a movie with him in it since Black Dahlia, the biggest piece of crap ever made), and was probably the best actor in the movie. I'm definitely going to see this one again."

","Think of this movie as a Twilight army having babies with monsters from The Descent, and what you got is a violent, gory, fantastic movie! Let me start off my saying that I HATE vampire movies, they are too sci-fi for me. But there is 1 exception, and that is this movie. These aren't good looking vampires who want to fall in love and care about people, these are vicious monsters who are scary as hell. This is one of my favorite movies, because it doesn't play out like a vampire movie. It feels new and fresh and original, it feels like this shouldn't even be considered a vampire movie. It is creepy and an all around great movie. The only reason that I am not giving it 10 stars is because of the end, but even with the end, this is a great movie. I highly suggest it."
"Woodyanders","9","3","6","7 August 2008"," An excellent, inspired and supremely unsettling vampire horror knockout
","A vicious clan of deadly vampires lead by the ferocious Marlow (a positively terrifying portrayal by Danny Huston) lay siege to the remote small town of Barrows, Alaska during a month long period of total darkness. Gallant Sheriff Eben Oleson (a fine and likable performance by Josh Hartnett), his feisty estranged wife Stella (well played by Melissa George), and a motley handful of others do their best to survive this nightmarish ordeal. <br/><br/>Director David Slade makes the most out of the ingenious script by Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie, and Brian Nelson: the gripping story unfolds at a constant brisk pace, the suspense gradually builds to a harrowing fever pitch (the protracted sequence with the vampires killing all the townspeople is absolutely bloodcurdling), the bleak wintry landscape evokes a strong sense of isolation and vulnerability, the outbursts of savage violence are truly jolting, and the human characters react in a plausible way to their impossible situation. Moreover, the stellar acting by the sturdy cast qualifies as another significant asset: Harnett and George both excel in their roles, Huston makes for a perfectly malevolent head ghoul, plus there are sound supporting turns by Mark Boone Junior as the gruff, bearish Beau Brewer, Ben Foster as the deranged the Stranger, Mark Rendall as Eben's sweet younger brother Jake, Amber Sainsbury as the spunky Denise, Manu Bennett as the amiable Deputy Billy Kitka, Megan Franich as lethal vampiress Iris, Nathaniel Lees as the easygoing Carter Davis, Joel Tobeck as the hotheaded Doug Hertz, Elizabeth Hawthorne as gutsy diner owner Lucy Ikos, and Abbey-May Wakefield as a nasty little girl vampire. The vampires themselves are wonderfully vile and grotesque: they're hideously malformed subhuman beasts with long nails, pasty complexions, super human strength and speed, and their own odd guttural language. The striking cinematography by Jo Willems offers a wealth of amazing visuals while Brian Reitzell's hypnotically chilling score hits the shivery spot. But what really makes this fright feature such a winner is its grim, harsh, no-nonsense tone: the central protagonists are forced to make some hard choices in order to stay alive, the merciless vampires spare no one from their bloodthirsty wrath, and the film stays fiercely true to itself to the literal bitter end. A splendidly tough and gritty treat."
"zofos","6","3","6","23 June 2008"," And Soon The Darkness
","This film has a similar central idea to ""Pitch Black."" Both movies deal with monsters that can only come out at night being suddenly given an extra opportunity to attack as often as they wish due to the disappearance of the sun (in ""Pitch Black"" it was because of an eclipse, in ""30 Days of Night"" it's due to Barrow's extreme northerly position in the winter). It also has a remote Alaskan setting like ""Insomnia,"" but that film dealt with the 24-hour daylight Alaska has in the summertime.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett plays the Sheriff of a small Alaskan town that, for one month every year, goes into complete darkness. This coincides with the arrival in the town of a pack of blood-thirsty vampires (from Russia perhaps? Alaska isn't too far away from Russia and the vampires do have an odd, clicking, Eastern-European-sounding dialect).<br/><br/>Hartnett arrests a man in a diner for demanding raw meat with menaces. He brings him to the jail in the Sheriff's station where the prisoner's demented ramblings seem to be portents of impending doom (He is a lot like the Renfield character in ""Dracula,"" with his mad ravings, unusual eating habits and his apparent connection with the vampires).<br/><br/>The film seems to be heavily influenced by the work of John Carpenter, particularly ""Assault on Precinct 13"", ""The Fog"" and especially ""The Thing."" There is also a nod to ""Salem's Lot"" when a vampire crashes in through a kitchen window at astonishing speed and then slowly rises to his feet. After that, the film becomes a sort of horror version of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" with the survivors of the vampire extermination holed up in an attic and jumping at every noise outside.<br/><br/>Melissa George is the heroine and she looks gorgeous as always. She's rapidly becoming a scream queen for the YouTube generation with her appearances in ""The Amityville Horror"" remake, ""Paradise Lost"" and now ""30 Days of Night."" Josh Hartnett makes a welcome return to the genre he started out in with ""Halloween H20"" and ""The Faculty."" For some reason, he only seems to make an effort in horror or sci-fi flicks. In movies like ""The Black Dahlia"" and ""Hollywood Homicide"" he was sleepwalking and didn't seem interested at all. Here he does seem committed to the part and it's good to see him giving his all again.<br/><br/>The vampires are a little anonymous. We don't know anything about any of them. Where do they come from? What language are they speaking? How old are they? Nothing. They are just a bunch of bloodsuckers and that's it (John Carpenter always says he prefers to have characters with no back-story in his films, so there's another Carpenter touch for you).<br/><br/>We do learn in this film that you can kill vampires with an axe (that's a new one on me!) There are no stakes, garlic, crucifixes or holy water in this movie! <br/><br/>The ending stretches credibility and doesn't really satisfy, but up until then, this is a good, solid vampire movie. Be warned though, it's very gory and if you're at all squeamish, steer clear."
"lee_eisenberg","5","3","6","6 April 2008"," land of the midnight scum
","OK, so the northernmost city in the United States goes through a month of darkness with vampires - whose origin never gets identified - roaming the streets looking for blood. If the people in Barrow saw ""30 Days of Night"", they probably spent half the time identifying inaccuracies (namely how the sun set straight down, when in reality Barrow's location above the 70th parallel means that the sun rises and sets at about a 20 degree angle).<br/><br/>The characters are what I have come to expect in these sorts of movies. There's the hero (Josh Hartnett), his tough-but-delicate blonde hubby (Melissa George), and most everyone else exists to blurt out comments and eventually get slaughtered. I understand that the vampires' origins might not add to the story, but I would have liked to know whence they came; if the movie's gonna go so far as to give them their own language, at least explain their history.<br/><br/>So, if you just like to see gore, then this is definitely the movie for you. But the vampire movies that I recommend are ""Nosferatu"" (both the original and the remake), the 1931 ""Dracula"" (how can you not admire Bela Lugosi?), the 1958 ""Dracula"" (they started showing gore), ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" (directed by Mel Brooks and starring Leslie Nielsen; enough said), John Carpenter's ""Vampires"", and the Bugs Bunny cartoon ""Transylvania 6-5000"" (the last short in which Chuck Jones directed Bugs Bunny).<br/><br/>Also starring Danny Huston (John's son) and Ben Foster (Claire's friend on ""Six Feet Under"")."

Just as I expected, 30 Days of Night turns out to be pretty dull, but is made just about watchable thanks to the occasional spot of decent gore.<br/><br/>The film starts off promisingly enough with a stranger to the remote town of Barrow destroying the inhabitants' mobile phones and killing their sled dogs. When he is caught by Sheriff Eben Oleson (Whatsisname) and thrown in jail, the man warns that 'they' are coming. So far so good.<br/><br/>Then it all goes wrong: 'they', as it turns out, are a gang of bloodthirsty vampiresand what an irritating bunch of crap bloodsuckers they prove to be! Head vampire Marlow (Danny Huston) is just laughable, looking like Neil Tennant (from the Pet Shop Boys) and speaking like a Klingon; the rest of the bloodsuckers look okay, but insist on hissing and screeching like demented velociraptors from Jurassic Park, and really grate on the nerves.<br/><br/>Director David Slade, whose last film was the impressive 'Hard Candy', manages a few decent moments of gory mayhem (an overhead shot of the vamps spilling blood into the snow; the big tractor-like machine with the big whirly blades, slicing and dicing through the vamps with ease; and the axe decapitation of Deputy Billy), but there are far too many dreary scenes featuring the survivors cowering in a variety of abandoned buildings.<br/><br/>Slade also succumbs to that annoying trend that has blighted many a recent movie: wobbly camera movements, with rapid editing. What action there is, is made extremely difficult to watch.<br/><br/>The very silly ending, in which Eben deliberately infects himself with vampire blood in order to defeat the enemy, is perhaps the worst part of the whole film, and left me wondering how such a daft finalé could have ever seemed like a good idea.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for the gore."

","Based on the graphic novel of the same name, 30 Days of Night is about the survivors of a vampire raid on the small Alaskan town of Barrow. The cinematography is clear, chilling, and stylish. From the very beginning, before things even go bad, you feel a dark event on the horizon. The mood of the movie is unyielding and never lets go of its serious tone; You really feel the sense of struggle, hope, and loss at every turn. The performances are spot on and never seem too plastic or fake. I was really impressed by the soundtrack too as it's filled with ambiance and subtlety that helps build suspense and tension. Note that this movie is your typical hard core horror movie. You won't get any comic relief here (hello I Am Legend), this will creep you out. From beginning to end 30 Days is every thing I expected it to be. My only disappointment comes from the ending. I won't spoil it but will say that it is less than fulfilling. A sad addition to a very common problem with good movies. It never quite feels finished, but maybe that's intentional."

"vertigo_14","9","3","6","8 November 2007"," Abandon Your Comfort Zone. (spoilers)
","'30 Days of Night' is quite the impressive modern American horror fare, especially when considering that most of that market bulges with bland remakes, sequels and poorly written movies. And while operating on some convention, such as the creepy kid who becomes infected or the excessively gory visual punch (a whole head gradually becomes detached from a body with an ax), '30 Days of 'Night' works well because it loads enough well-timed action, suspense and psychological stir that forces viewers from their comfort zones.<br/><br/>Though, this is an easy accomplishment where the story itself dictates extremely limited mobility of its characters--survivors in a rural Alaskan town desperately try to defend themselves a sudden vampire infestation at a time when the sun disappears for thirty days. They are placed in a situation with such dubious odds of survival against very powerful adversaries who may or may not be susceptible to traditionally held rules about killing vampires (""it doesn't mean that what worked against Bella Legosi will work against these guys"")--or even how they should be presented (they speak in their own language). Once bitten, the transition to life as a bloodsucker isn't as swift, but once it occurs, the ruthless vampires are incredibly fast moving and their senses extremely deft compared to townspeople armed with regular artillery and weaknesses against the elements. <br/><br/>The filmmakers don't need periodic gotcha's and typically written characters like foolish teenagers to get the blood pumping, your eyes glued to the screen and your mind guessing what will happen next. Moreover, this film presents a commendable psychological angle, in which morality is questioned among the survivors in ways reminiscent to John Carpenter's 'The Thing' and, in challenging the viewer's own expectations about how tales such as these should end, it is as similarly short on happy endings. '30 Days of Night' is definitely worth seeing."

The vampires are actually frightening in this one. The action is tight, the direction and photography solid. Performances are strong and the ending almost poetic.<br/><br/>The story is creepy and even though this is based on a comic, it comes across as believable. The vampire lore comes across as grounded in reality and the behavior of the villains is harsh and brutal - unlike any recent example of vampire seen in film or television.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. An excellent example of how to make a horror film. Hats off to the David Slade and his team! Steven."
"jellyfish74","9","3","6","24 October 2007"," Finally, a vampire film that is truly horrifying...
","Ever since I was a little kid and caught 'Salem's Lot on TV, I've been fascinated by the lore and legend of vampires. I've read the book several times and find it to be very downright scary and a perfect vampire tale. If you ask me, Spephen King imagined the most frightening, nightmarish incarnation of these creatures the world had seen and that was back in 1974! Since then vampire movies, though entertaining enough, just haven't hit the nail on the head. I've longed for the day when we would lose the frilly, lovelorn vamps of Dracula and Lestat lore, the wise-cracking, leather bound, techy ninjas of Blade, Buffy and Underworld and get back to what makes vampires a thing to be really, really afraid of. 30 Days of Night gets this right and does it in spades. And thank God for it (God? No God.)! These vampires are entirely worthy of our worst childhood nightmares. They are base, vicious and cruel. They are soulless, dead-eyed, pale animals who take great joy in tormenting and horrifying their prey before violently tearing them to bloody shreds without mercy. The guttural and ancient sounding language they choke out between satanic shrieks just adds to the level of danger and menace that simply drips from the screen like blood. I'm telling you these creatures are spine-chillingly frightening! <br/><br/>And what's a good vampire tale without the right setting? The small, isolated town of Barrow, Alaska is the perfect backdrop for this hellish nightmare to unfurl. Bleak and minimalistic, completely cut off from the outside world and thus any help, it truly folds you into it's dark and doomed embrace. The slow-burn pace of mounting dread within the towns (remaining) citizens is incredibly effective in achieving the gut-wrenching sense of paranoia and fear that this movie basks in. Barrow itself is so beautifully portrayed that you can nearly feel the cold shrieks of arctic wind yourself. I really can't properly convey the beauty of the cinematography here, as well as the perfect set design. Again, 30DN gets it oh-so-right.<br/><br/>If I were to have any gripe at all, it would be with the end of the film and what the protagonist does as his final, desperate act to save his town and his people. It was the ONLY time my suspension of disbelief was, well, suspended. But it's a small price to pay for such a superb, frightening and convincingly realistic portrayal of the vampire myth. If you, like me, are a fan of the vampire genre, 30 Days of Night is a MUST see. You won't be disappointed."

However when the time comes for action it doesn't let up. Take a girl with you and she will be on your lap in no time. The acting is solid though the story line is one we have seen before. It was predictable to me but not everyone watches as many movies as I do and can figure them out as easy. There was not a lot of bad language so if your child is a horror fan it is sure to give them nightmares without adding to there vocabulary.It's well worth the price of admission."
"cpbadgeman","7","3","6","22 October 2007"," Moody, tense, grim vampire flick
","In recent years, vampire movies have transformed the undead into urbane clothes horses and pouting cannon fodder for roided-up alpha humans. Now, ""30 Days of Night"" takes vampires closer to their mythological roots than they have been in years. The bloodsuckers in this film are vicious, bestial, and ugly. Though humanoid in appearance, they truly seem monstrous. Their descent on the remote town of Barrow, Alaska has the sole aim of allowing them to feast on all the inhabitants as quickly and as brutally as possible. Barrow is so far north that in winter the sun does not rise for thirty straight days. As a result, a small group of (quite honestly, rather colorless) survivors led by Josh Hartnett have to evade and fight off the vampire horde for what seems like an eternal night.<br/><br/>Director David Slade creates an atmosphere of tense foreboding, peppered with unanticipated shocks for the audience. The audience is drawn into a merciless, frozen world where the only thing that matters to either side is simple survival. Though the action scenes are expertly staged and plentiful, there are none of the completely OTT set-pieces (with souped up vehicles, guns firing holy water, ridiculous pyrotechnics, and obviously CGI effects) that have contaminated the horror genre in recent years.<br/><br/>The vampires are allowed to be mysterious and menacing. We are not given any back story as to where they came from -though we see a derelict freighter in one of the opening shots, and they seem to speak some Slavic dialect. They are deliberately left as a terrifying enigma. Unfortunately, the human characters are really rather dull and it is difficult to care deeply for any of them.<br/><br/>To wrap up, this is the best vampire movie in years. It lingers in the mind and offers ample quantities of gore, suspense, and thrills. There are a number of solid plot twists, and the script resists the temptation to offer any easy answers to the dilemma facing the ever-more overwhelmed townsfolk. By any standards this is a gruesome, chilling, Halloween treat for horror fans of all sorts."

It's about time; while not exactly following the vampire legends of old, the undead in this flick have a lot more in common with ""Nosferatu"" than they do with Johnny Depp's ""Dracula."" For that matter, they're a good deal closer to what Bram Stoker envisioned vampires to be than what we've seen for the last few years coming out of major studies... and all I can say is, MORE! The movie generally had plenty of action and few, if any, slow spots that weren't included to effectively build suspense. For once, we got a film that spends more time on developing a nightmarish story than on cheap, unnecessary scares. The acting was good, the pacing was flawless, and the imagery was really the stuff of our worst dreams Â— streets running with blood, unflinching brutality, and what is probably the best decapitation scene to hit the screen in years. If you can watch this film without feeling your guts clench at least two or three times, seek medical attention. At least check to make sure you still have a pulse! Fans of the foppish walking dead will probably hate this, but for real horror fans this is a ""do not miss"" flick.<br/><br/>Thank you, ""30 Days of Night,"" for giving us back vampires with teeth!"

","Superb cinematography and special effects combine with outstanding performances and literate storytelling to produce one of the few truly epic vampire films in 30 DAYS OF NIGHT. The director's acute focus on his stellar cast and their would-be killers accounts in no small part for the effectiveness of this film; in fact, in the hands of a lesser filmmaker (of whom there are all too many these days), this could very easily have deteriorated into another stinkfest. From the moment the ""Renfield"" character wanders from the ice-bound ship, it's clear that this isn't going to be just another hokey, ho-hum horror movie: the fx are so beautifully integrated into the gorgeously-shot sequence that it suggests at once that fright film fans are in for a (trick or) treat. This early promise is fully realized. The aerial sequence showing the overwhelming assault on the hapless townsfolk calls to mind the very roots of the legend itself, and suggests that the horrifying legends stemmed not from some faint scratching at the door and imaginations run wild but from some unforgettable night of bloodletting that must needs endure in legend thenceforth. Like the Nazi occupation of Europe that followed. (The parallel is there: the survivors hide out like the family of Anne Frank, and the town itself looks like and is laid out not unlike a concentration camp.) The final decision of the Hartnett character makes sense, given the situation, and makes for one of the most poignant endings I've ever seen in a fright film. 30 DAYS OF NIGHT is everything one could ask for in a fright film. Bravo."

The ending was very vague and disappointing: It would have fared better if the people had returned to see what had happened to the town instead of just being burnt to the ground.

I found almost all of the cast on the verge of hysterical laughter, which killed any chance for me enjoying it. had it been deliberately played for laughs I might have succumbed. Only the vampires were convincing. They were much more serious. Not since William Hurt, hiding his embarrassment behind a beard in 'The Village', has an actor looked more like falling about in hysteria, as Hartnett does in this, again helped by a bit of a beard. Who wrote the wonderful script? Every time the survivors moved their base, it was announced they had to leave again. Did large segments get abandoned on the cutting room floor? I would have left it all, actually. Regarding the dialogue, only the vampires' strange lingo was anything like convincing. The rest of the script was pure comedy. Finally, in spite of the extensive gore, I was not once concerned about any of the characters because there was not a single scrap of tension or suspense. it made 'Dog Soldiers' and even the dreadful 'Underworld' seem passable."

Apart from having so many goofs in depicting a Barrow and the arctic that it became a source of distraction, there was much too long a wait for real action! Then we were subjected to what seemed to be the standard, generic, plot that we've all seen in countless B films and TV shows with a veneer of the vampire story. My wife thought that the language spoken by the vampires sounded, insultingly, close to native Alaskan speech patterns; especially since the native population of Barrow was almost completely left out of the film. She also thought that too much of the mayhem was off-screen, we were left with interior scenes of people talking and talking when we could have been seeing blood flying in the snow. The white outs could have looked like white outs: nothing visible and death coming suddenly out of the white. The vampires could have been naked, not dressed in evening-wear.

This was by far the scariest vampire movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a vampire attack on a secluded town in Alaska during a month-long period in which there is no daylight (which, by the way, is true, Alaska really does have periods like this). With no sunrise to look forward to and no way to reach help, there is an added sense of helplessness for those in the town.<br/><br/>Very early in the movie (within the first ten minutes), a gruesome and disturbing moment gives the audience a preview of what is to be expected throughout the rest of the picture, and the movie doesn't let up much from that moment on. Blood flows freely and the body count adds up very quickly as the month-without-a-sun period begins.<br/><br/>The vampires themselves are portrayed as intelligent, merciless, and especially vicious creatures in this movie, which is vastly different than the romantic seducers we see in most Dracula renditions, and a little different than the nearly human vampires we see in Blade or Underworld.<br/><br/>Without giving much away, I'll say this movie was well put together, and is clearly designed to not only scare the crap out of you, but also to leave with the disconcerted feeling you might have after watching one of the Saw movies. The violence in this movie is among the most gruesome I've ever seen, and there are enough disturbing moments to keep the audience unsettled throughout. In fact, it seems as if the writers sat and came up with every disturbing scenario they could imagine, and did their best to incorporate them all into one horrible nightmare. I would rank this movie as one of the scariest of all time, and there are several people who went to the theater with me who would concur."
"mql5184","7","4","10","20 October 2007"," It's Barrow, Alaska, where are all the Eskimos?!
","Overall, I thought this movie was entertaining. The pace was good, and the action certainly kept my interest. Watch for the fly-over scene of the carnage through the town when the vampire attack gets into full swing. That shot is the best thing in the movie. The vampires were creepy enough, but what's with the same, tired long black trench coats? Thank goodness the dialog was kept to a minimum. As an aside, my friend who is a native of Barrow says they captured the look of the town pretty well. But we were all wondering where all the natives went to? Barrow is mostly populated by Native Alaskans. Did they all get some psychic signal (because all native peoples are psychic, you know). Maybe the ""shaman"" told them that the blood-sucking (insert made-up Eskimo word here) were back and they should hide on the ice in their igloos, eating seals and swapping wives until the vampires are gone? Oh but that would be racist, so lets just pretend that Native Alaskans don't really live there, because that's not racist at all. The writers obviously didn't think of Alaska as anything more than a backdrop. Aside from the no-bright-light thing, this could have taken place in any small rural (white) town that gets a hefty amount of snow. I really would have liked to see a bit more effort from the writers."
"cobbler88","2","5","14","20 October 2007"," The idiot's vampire film. Please avoid it.
","I'll try to be as vague as I can, but I felt it was necessary to write that this may contain spoilers of one kind or another. But if you do not want to read further, my point is basically that this is a film in which almost nothing stands up to the least bit of logical thought, even with the suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Like many of you, I was lured to watch this film with the hope that it would be as entertaining as other films based on graphics novels like ""Sin City"" and ""300."" It seemed like a sure thing, giving the shaky-camera treatment to a twist on the vampire story. But something went horribly wrong along the way.<br/><br/>We begin with the town of Barrow, Alaska, closing down for a 30-day period in which there is no sun. Skip forward a bit, and we've got a town under siege by perhaps the most pathetic group of vampires since those in the original ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" Don't get me wrong, they rate fairly high when it comes to freaky appearance. But we've got a town that, because of an exodus during the season, is down to 152 people. From here, we basically go to the same premise as every zombie movie ever made: A small group of survivors has to avoid capture, death, or a fate worse than both. The clock is ticking at 30 days because the sun will rise again after that stretch.<br/><br/>NOW, there seem to be a few dozen vampires. And they know they have 30 days to feast. So they proceed to pretty much exhaust the entire food supply on the first day, then have a HECK of a time finding the survivors over the next month in a town of about 40 buildings. This attempt is made even more difficult by the fact that, with their superior physical abilities and numbers, the vampires still choose to hide and lurk about, rather than systematically checking every building in town in groups.<br/><br/>There is some dialog on the part of the vampires, but it's generally nonsensical and doesn't really tell you anything. I'm not even sure more than one vampire ever speaks. In fact, you don't learn anything about the vampires, other than they don't manage to clean themselves up during the entire 30-day period. And as much as they enjoy the killing, once they seem to be seriously low on food (lets say, the last 29 days), there really is never any indication that they or the people trying to elude them are ever actually hungry. This being the case, you're kind of left wondering why they are attacking the town to begin with.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this basically is like ""The Blair Witch Project"" in one important way: Once you begin to think about it in the least, it suddenly becomes incredibly stupid. And style doesn't compensate the viewer for the lack of substance. Avoid this flick at all costs."

","OK. The guy before me said this: ""the realistic reactions from the characters made me feel like i wasn't watching some trashy cheesed out horror flick."" What the f***. Apparently we weren't watching the same movie. I went to this movie expecting a grisly blend of 300-style cinematography/action sequence and 28 Days Later-style plot/atmosphere. I was incredibly disappointed. Apparently Steve Niles has never left his home, because he has NO idea how real people speak or behave. In terms of dialogue, this is the absolute WORST movie I've seen in a very long while. I laughed the whole time. Shame on Sam Raimi for attaching his name to such garbage. On the bright side, the cinematography was incredibly well done, and the vampires were damn creepy. However, this simply could not make up for how horribly written the entire movie was. The best part of the whole damn show was when some kid fell when he got up to get popcorn. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
"garrettwilliams914","3","6","18","19 October 2007"," What am I missing?
","I've never written a bad review for a film but...<br/><br/>I saw this film at an advance screening last night and I honestly don't see why anyone would call it groundbreaking. The plot line was predictable, there was a complete lack of suspense, and even the ""jumpy"" moments lacked energy. Most of the action sequences were shot with such shaky camera movements and a jarring frame rate (presumably to hide the sub-par fight choreography) that it was hard to tell what was going on. I can say at least the gore was well done and you do get to see an entire beheading with an ax, but scenes like that didn't happen often and when they did they were not scary. The only other saving grace of this film was an aerial shot of people running through the town shooting at the vampires a la Apocalypse Now. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend paying to see this movie."

","I'm not going to write a long review because I've already wasted two hours of my life on this absolutely horrible movie. Suffice it to say it was not scary at all and anyone who says it is either smoked crack through the entire movie or they are kids who paid to see another movie and sneaked into this one. Do not waste your money on this one. You've been duly warned. This movie was such crap that my wife now wants to warn you as well.<br/><br/>I am a lover of horror movies, always have been, always will be. My husband went on this site and read me some of the reviews here, and we were mutually impressed by the good reviews. This movie proved to me, yet again, horror movies have gone on a downward spiral and movie makers have their work cut out for them to really put the horror back in a movie. I felt this movie had too many places you could see it wanted to be scary, it just wasn't for me. I have not one good thing to say about this movie, I was looking forward to day 30 to say the least. To top it all off, we paid full price to it and had nothing but loud cell phone user, teen daters, loud laughers (im sorry was this a comedy???!!!) in the crowd. Adults be warned of the audience this draws."

","If you're seriously looking for a ferocious, modern-day vampire story that contains no glamour, just gore, then 30 Days Of Night just might be more than enough to satisfy your hunger and quench your thirst.<br/><br/>Set in far-off Barrow, Alaska (during their winter's month-long polar-night), a voracious troupe of no-name vampires unceremoniously waltz into town and immediately engage in a brutal, non-stop feeding frenzy where Barrow's terrified citizens are the #1 choice on the menu.<br/><br/>(Get the picture?) <br/><br/>Even though this $30 million horror story was noticeably over-long at 152 minutes, its pace rarely seemed to lag and its blood-splattered gore and hideous make-up effects were, without question, first-rate.<br/><br/>One problem with 30 Days' story was that no background was given on this particular pack of hissing, screeching bloodsuckers. Without being clued into their origins, one is left wondering exactly how old they are and how they've managed to survive up to this point.<br/><br/>'Cause if these vampires actually operate the same way, as they did in Barrow, with such a lack of caution everywhere they go, then one couldn't imagine that they could continue to survive for very long at that recklessly rabid rate.<br/><br/>Even though 30 Days did deliver a pretty gruesome story of hide'n'seek, it inevitably lost itself some significant points for its blatant product placement of Pepsi and Oreo cookies."
"MLDinTN","6","3","7","29 September 2008"," lots of gore and plot holes
","This movie was a little more graphic than I expected and that's a good thing. However, I had lots of questions throughout. Never mind the fact that in Alaska when the northern most parts have total darkness in winter, it is a gradual thing. They don't have 8 hours of sunlight one day and complete darkness the next, which is how this movie seems to depict it. The concept is a good one. A group of foreign vampires, perhaps Russian since they arrive by boat, send a human to the town of Barrow to destroy all phones and lines of communication as well as sabotage the only helicopter and others forms of transportation, such as sled dogs. The whole dog thing was so brutal and I did not want to see that.<br/><br/>Then when the town's 30 days of darkness begins, the vamps begin attacking local citizens to feed. There are lots of closeups of blood squirting out of sliced throats, etc... Next problem I have is that Josh Harnett isn't exactly what you would think a sheriff of some isolated Alaskan town would look like. And once darkness comes and the power is cut, how come there seems to be so much light when the towns people are running around outside. When it's snowing, there would be no light from the stars or moon, so why did it look they had tons of light set up outside.<br/><br/>Next issue, the vamps go from house to house tearing it apart looking for survivors. Why do they never do this to any of the buildings the survivors are hiding in. Why do they allow these humans to live for days on end instead of finding them hiding in houses. Also, when the survives stupidly go running around the town, why are they never spotted by the vamp lookouts on the roofs. Also, what was the point of running to the grandma's house for the UV lights. The sheriff proves it does hurt the vamps, but he only uses it on one before they cut the power. Was that worth risking his life for?<br/><br/>As for the ending, I liked it. I never expected the sheriff to come up with that solution to save the day so to speak.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you like a good horror movie with lots of blood and gore, then watch this."
"patnanc1","4","3","7","6 May 2008"," About as deep as a puddle.
","I just watched this film with a friend and we felt so utterly appalled that we had to sign up and save others from making the same mistake we have. Before i begin the 'movie-bashing' there were a couple of infrequent positives throughout the film- the gore is well done and there is a mild amount of tension built up at the beginning. However these aspects to not help to cover up the distinct lack of storyline and the poor conveyance of the personalities of all of the characters. There was a massive opportunity to take advantage of the love between the two main characters and take the plot to the next level, but this was barely exploited. The long and unexplained skips in time made it hard to follow what was going on and left a lot of the story unexplained, such as how the group made it to day 27 from day 7. The vampires themselves seemed fairly intelligent and powerful, yet they were not clever enough to think that the best way to catch the people would be to monitor where they would be getting their supplies from. On top of this, the amount of times that Josh Hartnett managed to escape from the vampires was ridiculous, especially considering how easilyh they managed to plough through the others. Furthermore the end to the story where the hero, unlike the others who were previously 'turned', had the heart of character to avoid mutilating his friends and concentrated on saving them- yet another of the ambiguities of the film. The ending was poor, it is assumed we were meant to be feeling some sort of empathy with Melissa George as she has just lost the one she loves, yet this is not really the case as the plot was never thickened enough to give us this sentiment. Yet this is primarily a horror story in the end, so core is a viable substitute to plot to some extent, which is why i have given this film a 4 rather than a 1"
"JJskillz","10","3","7","10 March 2008"," Best & most original vampire movie ever
","Let me just ay that this movie is by far the most and best vampire movie ever. This vampire horror movie was more than great for me because the story, the intensity, and the music was well balanced throughout the movie. I also love this one because of its lyricism, visuals, animalistic, but most of all, its originality.<br/><br/>The direction of this movie was primal and scary. In saying that, the vampires are dangerous and frightening. There are no sexy vampires like in Interview With The vampire, Underworld, etc. And really really thought that it was clever.<br/><br/>I've also liked this movie because of the curiosity that the vampires have and how they look at human beings as subjects they are observing before killing them. They just don't kill the humans just for the sake of killing and being scary. Humans in this movie are food and a case study for the vampires.<br/><br/>Therefore, you will realise and create visuals that you wouldn't see in another type of movie. You bring people to a world they would not be able to visit in real life. Most vampire movies made today are just bloodbath and gory for the sake of more bloods and don't make much sense.<br/><br/>So that's all. You will enjoy this horror because all the acting is great."

","I rented this thinking it would be another Grade D horror flick and was surprised at how great a vampire film it turned out to be. The directer, David Slade, also did another film Hard Candy which was wonderful. The Special Features in this DVD are worth watching too. I loved the vampire, Iris, played by the New Zealand actress Megan Franich. The make-up done on her was a fantastic job.<br/><br/>This director David Slade along with his production crew did an excellent job of showing the ugly, nasty and brutal side of vampires which has been glossed over or ignored in earlier times no doubt do to the fact that this stark, brutal portrayal of vampires could never be released to the general public in earlier times. Suave, sophisticated Bela Lugosi these vampires aren't It's a definite must see for fans of this genera."

","30 DAYS OF NIGHT (2007) *** Josh Hartnett, Melissa George, Danny Huston, Ben Foster, Mark Boone Junior, Mark Rendall, Amber Sainsbury, Manu Bennett, Megan Franich. Gruesome adaptation of the graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith about a remote Alaskan hamlet besieged by a plague of vampires at the dawn of their month-long descent into darkness. While the premise is intriguing the execution is a tad tedious but the violence and action surpass the limits of director David Slade's lurching helmsing. Kudos to the make-up artists squad for some truly inventive effects and nasty creatures of the night in their befanged glory."
"wyattej2000","7","3","7","22 October 2007"," Almost really good!
","This movie came really close to being a classic. First of all it is an isolationist film (i.e.The Thing, Assault on Precinct 13, Dawn of the Dead), and mood wise it does a great job. Claustrophobia, and paranoia ensue. The problem with this film lies solely in its editing. There are a couple of scenes that just come out of nowhere and are short and make no sense. These could easily be fixed and I think the will I bet these will be re-edited for DVD. Otherwise the film is pretty good, very violent and pretty gory/ graphic.

It was on the bloody side, but realistically when you're getting riped apart...there will be bloody flying. It's not your typical, scary monsters come, people dies, hero prevails.

He said that he's pretty sure that the town of Barrow is going to be in an uproar over this movie once they see it. There's no movie theater in the town so for now the only Inupiaq people who will see this movie are the ones who have moved or are visiting elsewhere.<br/><br/>This is the thing; if you're going to set a movie in a real town and that town happens to have a huge native population, then I think that you should show the people of the town some respect and not try to pass off Asians and Maori people as natives. I understand that the film was made in New Zealand but tossing a parka on a Maori does not an Inupiaq make! Native peoples of the world are not interchangeable and to substitute a member of one native population for another is careless and insulting.<br/><br/>My husband also pointed out that the vampires' language sounded insultingly close to that of the Inupiaq people, although I doubt that this was intentional (OK, I hope it wasn't intentional!)

","I am a big fan of The Thing (1982) and I was looking for films with similar vibes so I used IMDb advanced search; typed ''winter'' for keywords, then refined to narrow as feature films only, then horror as genre. This film was one of the films that were listed. So I didn't think about it much and started watching it without knowing anything about it. I can't tell that I really liked it, but it was an OK film. At least it didn't make me angry. <br/><br/>First I'd like to mention the negatives. I didn't like Josh Harnett's performance, nor any other actor's in particular. Despite the premise and the name of the film, you can hardly tell where(when) you are in the timeline of 30 days. And it doesn't even feel like 30 days, it really feels like the events in the story happened in a single day or two, and that's the biggest fail of the film considering the premise. If they managed to give the sense that days were getting harder and harder, the audience would feel the tension rising. But as I said, it didn't happen that way.<br/><br/>On the good side, I thought the vampires looked creepy, though I don't have any interest in vampires whatsoever.<br/><br/>I don't suggest it to anyone, unless you are looking for a film to watch with half of your attention to kill some time. It's not an awful film, but there is nothing special or smart about it either."

","Not much more to add to my review's subject line.<br/><br/>I will add the following observations, which many reviewers have already commented on as follows.<br/><br/>I will try to generalize my observations without putting too much into the details, but just in case my remarks contain spoiler material, I have added the warning.<br/><br/>Character Development: The Vampires<br/><br/>I didn't think of this right at the get go before writing this review, however, it just dawned upon me. Where did the vampires come from? I mean, we find out how they attack the small Alaska town. Where bits and pieces of their attack are revealed by death and destruction to dogs, cell phones, and power stations. But, where is the scene of them waking up in a damp, moldy cave somewhere. Or perhaps some ritualistic chanting around a Gothic looking symbol which's purpose is to demonstrate it their ""awakening"" time of the millennium or something. Oh, wait, that would mean the cave would have to be somewhere in the area of the Alaskan town.<br/><br/>Hummm? That also means, how did these vampires survive in the cold and freezing environment prior to the event which causes them to descend upon this town? Wait, that would be a total story line glitch. Simple to fix, I suppose. Easy. Since this film is a modern time based era (cell phones at least right?) I contend the writer could have created perhaps, a global warming cause which, perhaps, melted some snow caps somewhere where these vampires actually were ""frozen over"" way before sometime in the past. This causes them to become ""alive"" and ""eager for food - anywhere close by"" Yea, that's the ticket (by the way, I retain my copyright to that plot line, ha ha.)<br/><br/>Okay, now we have some context as to how and why vampires exist, and why there, in this remote Alaskan town.<br/><br/>Next: Character Issues: the vampires<br/><br/>This is a small, but interesting observation I made watching the movie. Now, these Vampires seem very functional. That is, they have some wits about them. <br/><br/>Now, here is my problem. If they are that highly functional, why were they not concerned with their personal hygiene? They just left that slobbery all over themselves? Point made. Technical: Ability of the Vampire Infection to transfer to non- vampire humans - How, when, and why not from blood splatter to the face, mouth, or eyes? At the end, Josh Hartnett's character decides to feverishly look for a surgical needle from some first aid cabinet somewhere. He then takes out this perfectly clean package, opens it, and goes to one of the dead, infected, recently killed (by hatched decapitation, which blood splatter everywhere). Then, he takes the effort to extract some blood from the dead vampire using the syringe needle. This, mind you, is after he has killed several other vampires with the hatchet, and has blood splatter here and there, to include around the face. The ultimate result of the injection (of infected blood into the blood stream) is to start the process of vampirism (yes, I made up that word). Now, here is the problem, at the end, his girlfriend and he are sitting waiting for the sun to come up to do a vampire suicide thing. She gives him a kiss on the mouth. This should be enough to infect her, but it didn't. Maybe this is a sequel vehicle. Given that said, and generally. All throughout the movie, and during the instances of fighting off the vampires, there are very blood splattering scenes which would result in the same kind of cross infection. This didn't occur. Visually: Fine, the movie seems to accomplish the Hollywood look. Is that really hard to do with today's technology? <br/><br/>Character: Josh Hartnett's character as the ""bad guy."" This is a valid observation made by other critics. Kind of like Jake Gyllenhaal's character in Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010). I didn't accept him as being the Russell Crowe bad ass, grungy killer dude. Okay, they did allow Hartnett to grow a beard. I found his brother's use of the axe, though tempered with fear, anxiety and fear, was more accepting than Hartnett's character doing the same violence.<br/><br/>Tools: Okay, lots of people got into how ""helpless"" the townspeople were when fighting off the vampires. Especially the use of the indoor Marijuana farm Sun Light. It totally worked when Hartnett's character used it, passively mind you, waiting for the evil vampire to enter the front door. There, Harnett's character stood, with the light pointed to the soon to be opened front door. Boom, the vampire enters, gets exposed to the light and instantly retreats. <br/><br/>The townspeople could have made a portable sun-light canon, using the generators and a vehicle to hunt down the vamps. By the way, where were all those powers Hartnett's character was supposed to acquire after the injection?<br/><br/>It appears he got his ass kicked most of the time, and there were no really displays of equal or super natural powers demonstrated during the fight between him and the king pin vampire guy. Oh yea, well, at the end there, he did punch a hole through his mouth. Kinda like Arnold Schwarzenegger does in the Terminator 1 (1984) during the opening scene when he punches through one of the street gang member's torso when trying to acquire their clothes.<br/><br/>So, for the Hollywood - visual impact - watchable up to 5. As far as the rest of the rating scale (6,7,8,9 & 10) those points are reserved for things which apparently, this movie is absent of."
"nitzanhavoc","9","2","4","21 February 2013"," Best vampires I've ever seen!
","I've really had low expectations, if any, when I set out to watch this film. I've had no information about the original comic strip, or the cast, or anything save for the short synopsis. Surprisingly, 30 Days of Night turned out to be the best film of the Monsters/Vampires sub-genre I've seen in a while, if not ever.<br/><br/>The story and build up are great, and really suitable for a vampires flick. An Alaskan town going through a full month with no sunlight, what grounds could be more fertile for a vampires attack? The perfect combination of supernatural with fitting realistic set-up. The exposition is carried out through the uncovering of the preparations for the attack, and continues to show the way the few survivors struggle to survive, giving us some aspects of post-apocalyptic and zombies films. The plot is pretty straight forward, simple and lacking in any challenging complexity or twists, but then again the plot is not the ""main feature"" of this film, not by far.<br/><br/>The entire cast has done a great job in my opinion, and I for one have been most impressed by Mark Rendall in the role of Jake, the main protagonist's kid brother. Script and cinematography have also been done just right. However, the best part of the film and the one that truly made it shine above all others which resemble it - has definitely been the vampires themselves. I'm not sure who deserves the credit for the amazing and almost perfect way in which the vampires have been designed and portrayed - but I've never seen better. These vampires weren't Victorian nobles like in Interview With the Vampire, not elitist pseudo- Goths like in the Blade trilogy. They were far from human despite having humanoid skeleton, limbs and such exterior organs. Their eyes, jaws, teeth and movement were savage and feral like beasts. Their banshee-like shrieks of communication and their authentic language topped it off, and really made them more alien-beast than human. I salute those in charge of creating these nightmarish creatures.<br/><br/>This has been the second time I've seen this film, this time as a preparation for the much anticipated sequel. I really hope it lives up to this film's standards. While lacking any real twists in the not that complicated plot - 30 Days of Nights just might be the best vampires film I've ever seen. Very, very highly recommended!"

Then, the setting is established. This is Barrow, Alaska - the northernmost town in the United States, and a 30 day night is about to fall as the sun disappears below the horizon. The mysterious man turns out to be an advance scout of a sort for a truly frightening gang of very bloodthirsty vampires, who have decided to use the completely dark and completely isolated town as a feeding station. Josh Hartnett did a good job as the local sheriff who at first can't figure out what's happening, but then when he does has to try to find a way to help a small group of people survive this nightmare for 30 days without being caught. This is one of the absolute best horror movies I've seen in a long time. The setting is perfect and is an original twist on the vampire legend, the cast does a fantastic job of presenting the fear and sense of hopelessness the townspeople felt in the situation, and those who played the vampires did so perfectly and were totally convincing. These vampires were a bit different from what we're used to. There was no sense of semi-romance or quasi-sexuality that we've often see portrayed with vampires, from the time of Bela Lugosi on. These vampires just want blood - and lots of it, and they're on a killing spree to get it. The ultimate solution that Sheriff Eben Oleson came up with took me totally by surprise. I hadn't thought of it at all even though I, along with the townsfolk, was trying to figure out how to escape this madness all the way through. The movie is very gory, and definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you're a fan of horror movies (and especially vampire movies) this is most definitely a must-see movie. The town's isolation is used to good effect, although it's also the only niggling plot point. When the vampires arrive, one of the first things they do to ensure that Barrow will remain isolated is cut all the phone lines. That makes sense, but it also creates a problem. Surely people inside Barrow can phone out, and people outside Barrow can phone in. Surely someone somewhere in the world would have noticed long before 30 days were up that they can't phone anyone in Barrow? Surely this would have been reported? I know it's dark, but surely somehow the phone company would have managed to get someone up there to investigate? I mean, in the setting, surely phone service (or at least ham radio service) would be essential for medical evacuations, etc. And yet this goes on for 30 days with no one caring that there's no contact at all? That stretches credibility a bit. Still, in my opinion, by the standards of the genre and on the basis of its originality and atmosphere, this deserves a 9/10!"
"kyleallen_9","10","2","4","22 February 2009"," Scariest Vampire Flick Ever!!
","30 Days of Night scared the living hell out of me, I went to see it when it first came out in October and it is the perfect Halloween movie. Im not a huge fan of vampire movies, but this one is awesome, i mean, i haven't seen a scary vampire flick since John Carpenters Vampires. This movie had Hollywood favorites Josh Hartnett(Halloween H20, The Faculty, and Wicker Park) and Melissa George(The Amityville Horror, Derailed and Turistas) as a few of the remaining townspeople, who are left to fight off a species of vicious vampires, who take over their town, which is surrounded by darkness for 30 days. Danny Huston(Children of Men) and Megan Franich portrayed the most vicious vampires that i have ever seen, as the leaders of the group. This film also starred Amber Sainsbury(The Ferryman) and Mark Rendall(Charlie Bartlett), as two teenage survivors fighting to survive in this graphic blood fest. Its definitely worth checking out!!"
"Jeddia","9","2","4","16 November 2008"," Very good
","30 Days of Night returns something to the screen that we haven't seen enough of in more recent vampire films - old world type vampires. I enjoy just about any decently made movie in the genre, but it seems that too many vampire movies nowadays contain the ""Neo-Vamps"". That is, vampires who are well cultured, well manicured, and even perhaps suffer from too much conscience. They all know martial arts, dance to techno, and are invariably clad in S&M leather and/or trenchcoats (not that I'd mind a visit from Kate Beckinsale...thank you very much). But vampires nowadays are more like the Immortals from Highlander - only with fangs.<br/><br/>30 Days throws a dozen or so old-world, savage vampires into a small Alaskan town in the one month during the year that they have no sun. It's an excellent premise, and the movie does not fail to take advantage of it. The cast is very good, the sets are excellent, and the gore is just right. Also worth a mention is the cinematography - specifically the overhead shot of the town's streets during the full siege of the creatures.<br/><br/>I don't dislike Underworld or the ""Buffyverse"" as some of the purists out there do, but there's much to be said about the sideways evolution of recent vampire films/shows. 30 Days of Night is a solid reminder of how horrifying a vampire movie can be. 9 out of 10 stars from me."
"pepekwa","8","2","4","5 September 2008"," great vampire flick
","As usual on here opinion is polarized and this appears to be a love/hate flick. Well, I'm firmly in the love camp. Its very hard to make an original and stylish vampire movie today, it would have been so easy for the producers to make a clichéd film but this movie stands out as one of the best modern horror films of recent years. Josh Hartnett and Melissa George lead the flick well as the hero/heroine and there is a good supporting cast with mark boone jr and the very underrated ben foster also put in good performances. What makes this film for me though, is the vampires, their hideous shrieking would make anyone's blood go cold,there were no fangs just dark solid pupils and the lead geezer was the epitome of fear. I do have one major gripe and its one that many detractrors of the film are right to comment on, its a bit unbelievable that these vampires with these super human abilities would not find the rest of the towns inhabitants within a few days let alone 30 and no attention is played to the cast's supposed hardship in living without power, light, any substantial food and having to creep around upon fear of death at any time for this amount of time. That aside though, there are some great sequences between the humans and the vampires,some very novel beheadings and killings and I liked the way this was gruesomely done but was not a gore fest. And I thought the ending was very imaginative and cleverly done, i would never have seen that coming. Easily the best vampire flick made in the last few years."
"zetes","6","2","4","24 August 2008"," Good concept, mediocre execution
","Vampire flick with a great concept: vampires invade Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost town in the United States, during the one month a year in which there is no sunshine. Josh Hartnett plays the town sheriff, Melissa George his ex-wife (I think) and Danny Huston the leader of the vampires. These vampires are the kind of modern movie monsters that aren't so suave as your classic vampire, but rabid, brutal, slobbering monsters. As such, director Slade applies 28 Days Later-like shaky-cam during the action sequences. That worked fairly well in 28 Days Later and its sequel, but is kind of annoying here. The film is actually pretty good at building a terrifying mood, and, despite the shaky-cam, the monsters are pretty scary. The heroes, on the other hand, are rather boring. The plot is basically your cast attrition model where a group of stereotypes gets picked off one-by-one. The film is condensed from a graphic novel, and I'd bet the source material is better. There are quite a few moments that felt underexplained, and though the film is supposed to cover a whole month, several days are skipped at a time and most of the action seems to take place in just a couple of days. I would still have probably given the movie a slight recommendation, but I thought the climax was rather silly."
"the_headless_cross","9","2","4","15 March 2008"," It's own movie IMO
","The graphic novel 30 Days of Night is one of my favorites. Excellent premise (why hasn't ANYONE thought of that before?), beautiful art, and gory as well! So news of the movie made me excited and the casting choices I thought were... a little interesting (Never imagined Eben being as young as Josh Hartnett, and Melissa George has long blonde hair while Stella in the comic had short black hair. OK, maybe that's a little nit picky, but whatever). But I thought the same thing I think whenever I think the casting choice is odd: The director knows something about them that we don't, so we'll have to see. I go into the theater expecting not only an awesome vampire movie, but a great adaptation of the graphic novel. Walking out I was a little disappointed with some of the changes they made (the divorce back story, Marlow being the brains behind the idea when in the novel he was against it). But now a second viewing I've realized that even if it's not a great adaptation, it is a good movie on it's own! It's still a bleak dark movie (no happiness, no laughs, no smiles, except if you smile during the gory bits), with some good gore (the snow plow scene is the highlight), and good characters you care about. Josh and Melissa end up doing good even if they don't remind me at all about the original characters. The main character highlight is Ben Foster as The Stranger. I like this actor for his versatility in acting. From the comic relief in The Punisher, to the hero Angel in X-Men 3, and now this creepy stranger. It's too bad he's not in the film for long, but he does wonderful for what time he has in this. But there were some things from the comic I wished they used (the Louisiana back story is important if they plan on adapting the sequel Dark Days), and this again is a little nit picky, but I would've preferred if at the end when Stella is watching the sunset with the vampire Eben before the sun kills him, if they had Eben turn completely to dust rather than having her hold his charred corpse. The former I believe is a lot more saddening, but that's just me.<br/><br/>Overall, alright adaptation, but if you let that go and watch it for a good scary vampire movie, then you wont be upset"
"greg-odynski-1","8","2","4","25 February 2008"," No mercy. Can't wait for the next one.
","When I first heard about this movie I thought , oh, another vampire movie..ho hum, but now that I have seen it...""holy blood bath Batman!"" I found this one to have a ""no mercy"" approach and the bad guys are really really bad! These vampires are unlike any seen in the past and I guess thats what makes it so creepy. I look forward to ""30 Days of Night 2"". Maybe we will see a little more history about this breed of vampire. The setting is brilliant for this type of movie and only adds to the suspense. If you are a horror fan and you like a lot of gory detail then you will not be disappointed. The acting is well balanced and is good enough to keep your eyes peeled to the screen for the next fright scene. Effects are pretty darn cool. Great job cast and crew!"
"Etrival","9","2","4","18 February 2008"," Very gritty. Very cool.
","I can honestly say that 30 Days of Night takes the tired, done to death vampire story and puts a rather fresh spin on it. Gone are the vampires who are so completely wimpy that Blade can kill with a single swing of his manly sword. These vampires are a new kind of evil, one that takes the speed and strength of previous vampires and kicks that up a notch. These are vicious, deadly predators. Animalistic. (Though they still wear the stereotypical 'goth' clothing: Black trench coats, black clothes, combat boots, etc.) Josh Hartnett plays Sheriff Eben Oleson of a small town near the northern spike of Alaska that experiences a full, uninterrupted month of darkness once a year.<br/><br/>That makes it the perfect playground for an orgy of violence and carnage delivered by the most basic of evils.<br/><br/>With a brilliant supporting cast including Mark Boone Junior, a chilling Ben Foster and beautiful Melissa George, backing the veteran silver screen star, David Slade directs a disturbing portrayal of the human instinct to survive and thrive in the desolate landscape while stalked by a tireless, terrifying death.<br/><br/>Vampire lovers... drink your fill.<br/><br/>I give 30 Days of Night, 9 out of 10."
"fygall","10","2","4","18 February 2008"," Brilliance
","At last, vampire fans have a movie worthy to the genre. We've had so many mediocre twists on the vamp tale since the last good one - Interview With The Vampire - and this one was a long time coming. OK, so the acting wont get any Oscars but its still good, what you'd expect from the likes of Hartnett, George, etc... Surprisingly the thing that took this to the next level compared with the rest was the sheer brutality of it, it was almost shocking. I love horrors, especially if it contains suspense, which this did. You really felt you were with the surviving party of townsfolk and felt totally unsafe. It was also thrilling to see an ending that was successful and doomed at the same time. Well done guys and thank you."
"saint999","8","2","4","15 January 2008"," Best in a decade
","Went to see this while my car got serviced. The clever idea of vampires taking advantage of the arctic night attracted me but I didn't expect such a good movie.<br/><br/>This is no art-house vampire film, except for the cinematography which deserves a 10. It was well acted and very well directed. They didn't explain the vampires, or tell you that much about the humans, you found out a bit here and there as it went along. Kept it interesting. The gore was appropriately disgusting - no death pornography. The action scenes had actions that fit the characters. I enjoyed it so much I forgave the sentimental ending."
"Ryu_Darkwood","8","2","4","24 December 2007"," Good vampire flick
","This movie reminded me of the recent remake of ''Dawn of the Dead''. Undead creatures are haunting a group of civilians, and they have to fight back with all means accessible. There is one big difference and that is that this flick is set into a small Alaskan town in which it won't be light within 30 days. And as we all know: undead thrive in the darkness. I liked the dark atmosphere and the black humor combined with a thrilling tale of saving yourself against the ultimate evil. I also adored how they gave the vampires a religious way of thinking. It's as if their leader is some cult-figure and the others follow them as mindless goats. Nice metaphor of how some religious people are brought into doing hideous things out of their beliefs. <br/><br/>The only thing is that there are a few clichés too many and the storyline feels a tad bit inadequate at times. It didn't spoil the experience enough to bitch about it, but it's worth to mention it to those who didn't see the flick yet."

","I saw the trailer of the film and i saw potential the only thing left to determine was the rating, there was no way you could pull off a good horror-vampire movie without blood/bleeding when I saw the confidence inspiring ""R"", and ""Sam Raimi"" as the producer I knew i wouldn't be disappointed.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of the movie was artistic but completely confusing and unnecessary, but after that the movie goes on a steep uphill curve.<br/><br/>Almost all the aspects of the movie are self explanatory, the mass migration, the reason the town exists, what who is thinking, etc etc.<br/><br/>Almost no time is wasted in unnecessary and long drawn conversations as too the why how, and that really helps with the feature length, KEEPING A MOVIE WITH A VERY LIMITED PLOT LIKE THIS INTERESTING FOR THE WHOLE RUN-TIME IS NOT A EASY JOB BUT THE FILM MAKERS HAVE DONE IT WITH ELAAN.<br/><br/>However i was not convinced about the flow of the days, the passage of time was very ineffectively captured at best, not only that, the way it was shown will lead to at least 20 improbabilities and impossibilities, this was one area where the film really lost out on.<br/><br/>Character development wasn't much but it was never missed, just the right amount of focus was laid on development, and luckily FLASHBACKS A STAPLE OF MOVIES WHERE EVERYONE KNOWS EACH OTHER NEVER REARED ITS HEAD.<br/><br/>The movie builds the tension and almost never really lets up, the movie lacked in numbers(there were a few good ones),the big tension or horror scenes (the ones where everyone laughs afterwards), but it made up easily on the tension that was maintained throughout.<br/><br/>The action was good but this wasn't that much of an action movie, explosions, guns and obviously hand to hand combat are at a minimum and only used as means to move the story forward.THIS MOVIE IS MUCH MORE OF A HORROR THRILLER AND A WELCOME CHANGE FROM THE MORE ACTION ORIENTED VAMPIRE MOVIES OF LATE (which i am actually quite fond of).<br/><br/>Acting was very good all around, melodrama was at a minimum except towards the end, especially good were Manu as deputy sheriff and The stranger.<br/><br/>SURPRISINGLY ALMOST NO HUMOUR IN THIS ONE.<br/><br/>Technically merely good/OK because the perpetual dark doesn't get to you, even movies like Pitch Black did a better job, fear of the dark is almost a universal human trait and it could have definitely been exploited.<br/><br/>The other weak part was the end, it didn't really follow the tone of the movie, it was a typical FILMY (as we say in India) ending almost taking chick flick proportions its almost amazing this movie holds it own after such a weak ending.<br/><br/>Censorship once again affected my viewing experience with a bunch of dialogues being lost thanks to the shoddy editing, in a bid to cut scenes of what the censors consider inappropriate.<br/><br/>In all a great weekend night movie, can be enjoyed by anyone although it doesn't have enough action for a hardcore action fan.<br/><br/>-s very poor flow of days, VERY WEAK ENDING, technically OK.<br/><br/>+/-s explanations??? some people like/want them.<br/><br/>+s very good acting, interesting plot, tense throughout, a few very tense moments, one liners.<br/><br/>total 7.5/10 (im sure this movie will be better without censorship and I've added a half point for that, it did go above my expectations but i didn't factor that in because that would push the rating to high, the end was just to weak to merit a higher rating, and its a wonder a movie can get such good ratings with such a weak end )."
"gtkgr","8","2","4","19 December 2007"," one of the best vampire movies in years
","Although this specific genre is not my cup of tea I really enjoyed the movie.I think it applies to both horror fans and to regular viewers as it has everything in it.From tons of blood to well written script,nice cast,and it's beautifully directed.The story is not original though as it combines the scenery from Capernter's movie ""the thing"" with the typical Vampire like movies you all know.<br/><br/>It also reminded me a song from Judas Priest named Nightcrawler which refers to a beast that attacks a whole village and ppl hide in the cellar etc.This kind of stuff is all over the movie,as the poor human beings are huge underdogs to the bloodthirsty vampires...Maybe that's a good reason to see this especially if you dislike Hollywood-heroic-vampire hunters blockbuster movies like blade. Anyway with few words: claustrophobic,well written,highly recommended I almost forgot to write that the last scene is absolutely stunning :)"
"chrichtonsworld","5","2","4","30 November 2007"," Expected so much but yet again disappointed
","The fact that the movie takes place in the cold Alaska where just the sun went down for 30 days would be ideal for any horror movie.Only this should have provided an atmosphere that would creep us out whenever something strange happens. The problem is that the movie never gets scary or creepy even. It never makes good use of the setting. The lack of atmosphere could have been compensated with solid action scenes or building up some kind of tension. Not once did I feel despair or agony. How can we care for the characters if we don't really know them. The vampires appear in numbers and overwhelm the people living in the town. But when things are looking bad for the main characters the creatures just stop and vanish when they easily could have defeated them. This doesn't make any sense. Also we never learn about the vampires. Why are they in Alaska for god's sake? Only one explanation is given but also isn't good enough. There are some surprises in the movie that make the movie stand out a bit. But comes much to late to really enjoy the movie. I was so disappointed with ""30 days of night"" because it could have been so much better. The rare moments that are enjoyable just don't cut it. Very average!"
"mayurdeepz","6","2","4","13 November 2007"," NUTSHELL Review
","The heavy expectations of any enterprise, is its biggest downfall. I guess that sums up the whole experience of 30 Days of Night.<br/><br/>If you go into the movie to get your wits jolted or to feel that cold sweat trip down your forehead, you are more likely to come out disappointed. Having said that, it scores some browny points in another genre. ACTION. It is one of the more decent action movies to have come out this year. Knowing that we had ""300"", ""Transformers"" and the latest installment of the ""Die Hard"" series all release this year, thats saying a lot.<br/><br/>The thing that worked for me the most is that it does not try to be over the top complicated with serious plots and unexpected twists. It is pure fun, blood, gore. Not as much as the new acclaimed runaway cult hits like the ""SAW"" & ""HOSTEL"" series but still manages to pack a decent punch.<br/><br/>So my final word for the ones who have waited for this to see the light of the day (pun intended), like their life depended on it. Do not walk in to quench your thirst to get yourself soaking wet with terror filled images. But if you are looking for a fun filled action ride, stylishly shot, 30 Days of Night might just do the trick for you !!!"
"lonewolf_and_cub","9","2","4","4 November 2007"," A fantastic adaptation
","Like many nerdy comic fans i am always worried when Hollywood casts its gaze upon one of my favourite titles however I'm glad to say with 30 DAYS OF NIGHT I needn't have been. For one thing the screenplay came from creator Steve Niles himself and David Slade's direction captures the bleakness of Barrow perfectly along with the animalistic nature of the vamps. Because the original comic isn't very long it was necessary to add a lot of characters and completely original scenes thankfully all of these are fantastic and add to the drama of the film rather than detract from it- won't spoil it but I felt there were some really tense emotional scenes for a horror flick that I think enhanced the already good story a lot. Because it's such a good adaptation I hope they don't ruin it with a poor sequel based on one of the later comics. While the other important 30 DAYS comics DARK DAYS and RETURN TO BARROW feature great story lines and are quite creative I can't imagine them being translated very well into film. Anyway I enjoyed the movie immensely and for my money it is one of the best comic adaptations in years. Purists may not enjoy a lot of the changes but those people should loosen up and enjoy one of the darkest mainstream horror movies in years. As for the ending I wondered all the way through how well it would be done.....just one word for that... AWESOME."
"ravick626","8","2","4","3 November 2007"," Best vampire movie I have seen in a long time.
","It was about time the vampire went back to its true form, a bloodthirsty zombie like monster. I was tired of the same old, ""count Dracula"" type stuff you see. In some movies vampires are even portrayed as good guys, but I don't think that is what they are supposed to be. When you hear vampire, you don't think of a girl with tight leather shorts, NO, you think of monsters!! at least that is what I think of. this movie did a great job portraying that, and it actually made me scared sometimes. I don't want to spoil the movie, since it is actually worth the time to go see it. If you don't find this movie scary you will at least find it entertaining, its got some good acting in it too. The movie also has an unexpected ending."
"vaneasten","8","2","4","3 November 2007"," A fresh take on vampires
","The thing most memorable about 30 Days of Night is the sheer nastiness of the vampires themselves. Absent is any semblance of the seductive, vamp sexiness so worn out by Hollywood. These are truly vile, fearsome beasts, holding human form but total contempt for humanity. As the lead vampire says to one fallen victim ""What a plague you are.""<br/><br/>One might conclude that such creatures could just as easily have been werewolves or even aliens. I would differ. The human like form and odd pseudo-language of the 30days style vamps makes them all the more disturbing. Unlike some alien or animal-like beast, these predators ooze a sadistic joy which makes them a truly dreadful lot.<br/><br/>The film was not without faults. 30 days of night? I think it's actually over 60 days in the real Barrow, AK. The real Barrow? Nothing much like the Barrow depicted in the film. It would have been more plausible to simply make up a fictitious Alaskan town. I also thought the final fight between the hero and lead villain was a bit weak.<br/><br/>Faults aside, the film offers a fresh take on the tired vampire genre and delivers the goods for frights and gore. Obviously, this one is not for children or anyone bothered by horror effects in general."
"Jay_Exiomo","5","2","4","31 October 2007"," Starts good enough, sets along the way
","""30 Days of Night"" has an intriguing title and an intriguing premise - that of bloodthirsty vampires roaming a little Alaskan town where the sun won't rise during a 30-day stretch. And director David Slade, working on a script by Stuart Beattie and Brian Nelson, from the graphic novel of Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith, manages to build tension early in the film with this discourse.<br/><br/>Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) is a sheriff investigating a series of strange crimes in the isolated town of Barrow, Alaska, such as the burning of stolen cellphones and butchering of sleigh dogs. His estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) is in town for a fire inspection but missed her flight out just before the town is set for a month-long winter without the sun. Soon, they find themselves in the midst of a violent frenzy of hungry vampires.<br/><br/>As said before, it all starts promising enough. But then the film takes a disappointing turn somewhere along the way. The tension dissipates when Slade focuses on the handful of survivors as they try to survive the 30 days until the sun finally begins to rise. The plot becomes barely non-existent. Granted, it would be rather harsh to expect of a more intricate storyline for a film of this nature; but there's neither a sense of urgency nor a sense of sympathy for the characters as in, say, Zack Snyder's reworking of ""Dawn of the Dead."" And unfortunately, a bulk of the film is intent on focusing on them. The vampires can repetitively snarl only so much before they start to lose their intimidating factor.<br/><br/>The only time the film regains its emotional bearing is towards the end, with a beautiful shot of Eben and Stella against a backdrop of a rising sun. But it would have to take a long time to get there."
"billymullins","9","2","4","24 October 2007"," better than expected
","I have read the graphic novel and for some reason I did not dig the art but the movie really uses the original art and makes it it's own.<br/><br/>I loved this 28 days zombie and vampire hybrid. It takes the new concept of fast explosive ravenous zombies and adds a wolf like pack intelligence to the idea.<br/><br/>The movies characters have a 3-D feel, and the movie itself has an aura of John Carpenter’s the Thing. Probably because of the environment the story is set in and the suspense and the gore! So if you enjoyed this flick and have not watched this classic I highly suggest you do!<br/><br/>Best horror flick I’ve seen in a long time. I think the story’s ability to think small and not overwhelm the audience with an abundance of back-story, and special effects is really getting this genre back to its roots."

None of the characters tend to stand out, except perhaps Ben Foster though he isn't in the film too much.<br/><br/>Seeing a majority of positive reviews from the top reviews and cannot understand why. A lot of praise about how scary or gory the film is, but the horror really isn't much.<br/><br/>There are lots of blood and kills by the vampires and it is gruesome to look at but the majority of it is rather boring.<br/><br/>Also the lead character's motive in the end was bizarre and very strange. It made little sense as to why he thought of that after 30 days- as in why didn't he do it sooner.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie isn't interesting or engaging enough.

"mr_bickle_the_pickle","4","0","0","17 May 2020"," Cool Design and concept but overall dumb
","This movie is really dumb. I mean sure the vampires look cool. It has pretty good gore/kills. And I like the concept of being stranded in an isolated town being hunted in total darkness. But the film doesnt execute this very well. A lot of the characters make dumb decisions. The vampires make dumb decisions. The film has poor editing choices. There is some dumb dialogue etc. And fair warning, I'll have to mention spoilers.<br/><br/>Like for instance there is a scene where ""The Stranger"" has got a hold Eben's brother(sorry I forgot his name already) and is choking him out. Why does the grandmother and Melissa George's character NOT do anything? I mean, yeah he eventually lets go when Eben comes in and shoots him in the arm. But what if Eben hadnt come back at that very moment. Were they going to let him choke him? I mean Melissa George wasnt afraid to pull a gun on the guy earlier, so why is she just standing there? Also, its not long after this scene (when the power goes out) that Eben (who is Josh Hartnett btw) and Melissa George leave. They soon hear screams from the grandmother coming in from the walkie talkie so they rush back. There is blood everywhere and the brother is missing. They ask the stranger is he was taken who will not answer them. Now this could be a great moment to build some tension, however the next scene shows that the brother is safe at the diner. Which a)breaks said tension. and b)how the hell did he get out? I mean its not like this character is supposed to be some macho badass. And especially since the vampires seem to hunt in groups. Also, its dumb why they leave The Stranger behind. I get they want to reveal to the audience, that he was ""in on it"" in some capacity but they end up killing him anyway. So why didnt they just do that when the first at the police station and killed the grandmother. The biggest most annoying part to me though is at the diner Eben tells the others to make their way to so and so's attic and he will meet them there. Hes going to get supplies. However, we see him and Melissa George get into the truck and not too long after get attacked by some vampires. They of course get saved by some other townsperson and we see them make their way to said attic. Where they are greeted by the entire diner survivors. HOW THE HECK DID THEY BEAT THEM THERE? I mean, I would have assume that its a case where they did make their supply trip and that was just edited out or not shown at all. Otherwise that is flipping insane. I mean even with being attacked, they still headed out first and all. And I dont think it was implied that the others drove since he told them that if they heard noises to quickly roll under a crawlspace. It makes it sound like they walked there. Also, its said at one point (when theyre hiding out in the attic) that the vampires are searching houses. Are they inept at searching attics too? How does this foil the vampires. And later you see other survivors too...so are they just really bad in general? They even leave the attic at one point (cause they need food and what not) and get stuck there when it stops snowing. (Because, they were using the whiteout as a means of the vampires not seeing them). And again...why do the vampires not find them in a grocery store in an entire week? Also before this (while they're still in the attic) this one old dude (who probably has dementia) decides to wonder off and understandably the son goes after him. But why oh why is shouting at the top of his lungs
DAD!!!!!"". I mean, even if it works to get your dad to come out of whatever and walk to you...you are also addressing your location to the vampires who are going to attack you and your dad. Like, people are seriously dumb. Nobody tried to radio for help in this entire movie either. I get that the last plane left and all. But wouldnt you still try and radio out for some backup. Radio to the military or something? Even if it doesnt work....again....no one tries this. There plan for the most of the movie just seems to be ""Ride it out for 30 days"". It isnt until towards the end of this month that they get any ideas about trying to fight them. Which speaking of me leads to the next dumb thing. Eben deciding to inject himself with vampire blood to fight off the vampires and save Melissa George. I mean....honestly why is this a good idea. Even if he manages to keep his humanity long enough to distract, he has NO idea for how long for and could easily end up turning on his friends/brother. It's stupid and reckless. Also when he goes to fight...only the vampire leader fights and him and everyone else stands around. Even when Eben loudly shouts for Melissa George to run....they all stay there. None of them decide to run after her.<br/><br/>It's a just stupid. I think the film could have been something cool...but nah. Acting....they were fine. Nothing more, nothing less."

Especially because of the gut wrenching use (read: overuse) of the and-one-of-them-sacrificing-himself-for-the-good-of-the-many correlation. Blech. The one redeeming virtue of the use of this particular overused cliché is that once the husband at the center of The Couple to Beat is dead the only male left for the newly minted widow to mate with in this newly minted town of ""Barrow, population 5"" is that dead hero's little teenage brother.

","Niles and Beattie certainly aren't top writers, having between them written some misandric trash extending to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. But Niles' involvement in 28 Days Later: Aftermath seems to have drawn the good from it - the 'covering open spaces to get to stronghold sans vampire death' theme is welcome here. <br/><br/>The film is largely based on a family-run sherrifs office, taking the deputy or sherrif's day responding to cases as the way to present the growing number of perculiar happenings in the leadup to the onslaught. The number of suspects could have broadened after rather than before meeting one of them, but theres still enough mystery there all the same. I also like that such rare places do nonetheless exist on this planet, and it's nice to ponder how they live for an hour or two.<br/><br/>One thing I really like is the vulnerability of the sherrif, inasmuch as he doesnt try to pretend that hes any less in the dark than the villagers are. And the dark is the pretext here - 'meat' and darkness soon make for a disaster where surprisingly few survivors are scampering about between corners of the same unforgiving confines. <br/><br/>I dont think romantic plotlines are neccessary in any story, least of all horror, and that slows the warmup somewhat, but there is always a new development, and its a fairly enjoyable watch. The most heroic moment is actually from a character who is a relative outcast from the rest, and that is the warmest feeling one gets in this movie - that an outcast can be as worthy as anyone. 
I am a bit at a loss though how two main characters at the start of the film disappear by the end of it - the sherrif/deputy colleague of the protagonist, and a careless driver who - I think - appears only then. The other thing I'm not crazy on is the movie trope of the repeatedly-happy-looking-scream from one of the female killers, which gets a bit repetitive.<br/><br/>Like Blood Glacier, its perfectly watchable, entertaining, set in snow, dogs sadly die, and its a decent average thrill if youre working through a list of horror films."

","Utilising a weather phenomenon known as ""polar nights"" in which night lasts more than 24 hours. In this case, 30 days of eternal night where a small group of vampires take advantage of the darkness to massacre a town. It's up to the local sheriff and the remaining survivors to save the town from becoming ruins. Like I said, an interesting premise. It has all the right ingredients for a decent gory flick yet it never feels thrilling. Undeniably there is plenty of gore, with many scenes spewing blood out left right and centre. I'm talking hacking a guy's head off with an axe multiple times, many many many scenes of neck feasting and one vampire being pushed into a grinder. Suffice to say, genre enthusiasts will love this. Others though may find some difficulty. A B-List cast results in mediocrity acting. Unfortunately it shows here, I mean Josh Hartnett and Melissa George tried their best but they just come across as wooden. The more emotionally involved scenes of dialogue were delivered monotonously. Danny Huston as the vampire coven leader was excellent. Surprisingly being a vampire suits him. He was menacing, ominous and down right creepy. It's a slow moving film, which is mostly where the narrative fails. It takes a good thirty minutes before we see the legion of vampires. A good five minute scene of carnage is then followed by fifteen minutes of survivors talking in an attic. The characters had no emotional depth and were completely one-dimensional, so all these scenes of building backstory and development were wasted. Slade's direction was pretty solid, liked the shaky cam when the vampires were attacking. Great use of lighting to enhance the silhouettes of vampires in the background. Oh, and the last ten minutes were absurd. I'm sorry but I hated the ending. Felt like a chapter in Twilight! Apart from that, it's a competent horror film that will appeal to a select few, just needed more interesting characters and a better conclusion."

","30 Days of Night (2007) is a Josh Hartnett, Melissa George vampire movie. These two lead actors play a separated couple who must come together for the good of the townspeople around them when their Alaska town gets attacked by vampires. I liked these two talented actors in their roles, they fit them well in my opinion. The plot is pretty average and by the numbers for a movie like this, although some of the ways in which they execute that plot is different. I will not spoil anything in this review, but just suffice to say that there are some things that happen, especially towards the end, that do not typically happen in other movies similar to this. I appreciated that. The action is good most of the time, and I liked that this movie didn't completely rely on shock and gore, movies that do that are very weak.

","Vampire films are arguably one of the most over-exposed of the horror sub-genres, but TDON is a refreshing departure from what has become mainstream vampire movies. Set in a northern Alaskan town that experiences the natural phenomenon of losing the sun for a month, the town is besieged by a group of mysterious vampires. They are vicious, pitiless creatures, intent on wiping out the human race. <br/><br/>Ordinarily, I'd be looking for a bit of backstory to put the plot and its movement in context, and am usually annoyed when there is none. However, the lack of history of these vampires just adds to their mystique, and the sense of their eternal existence. <br/><br/>Josh Hartnett leads a crew of more than passable actors, but Danny Huston steals the show as the vampire patriarch, Marlow. He develops a style and execution that has the viewer actually despising the character, no easy task in modern cinema. The other vampire actors also display a merciless, violent approach that have you rooting for the trapped townspeople, just as their future seems hopeless. <br/><br/>The production values and sets are above average, as are the FX and CGI, certainly something you would expect from a big movie house like Columbia Pictures. The only thing that I couldn't wrap my mind around was the passage of time. Supposedly, these townspeople had to survive by hiding for a full thirty days, but the pacing of the vampire's killing and the thinning of the townspeople herd couldn't make me believe that they lasted that long. It was probably the most implausible part of the movie. <br/><br/>Still, it was an entertaining thrill ride for 90 minutes."

On a visual level, this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. There isn't a shot in the film that you wouldn't want to pause and admire. It is fast paced n well acted n directed.

","Vampires invade a snowbound Alaskan town during a month of complete darkness in this horror movie from 'Hard Candy' director David Slade. It is a pretty nifty idea (where would be a more appropriate place for creatures of the night to feed?) and Slade sets up the movie well with lots of uncertainty in the air before it is made clear that vampires are afoot. Ben Foster is delightfully sinister as a stranger in town who predicts the vampire plague and the icebound vistas appear appropriately ominous. Despite such promise, the film falls apart as it progresses because none of the characters are defined beyond broad stereotypes and none of the actors (Foster aside) have the charisma to render their characters relatable. Setting the film over 30 days is problematic too. It is hard to keep track of time and without scenes set aside to show the characters sleeping, eating, etc., it feels like the whole film has occurred over two or three days - not ten times as many. Most disappointing of all though is the highly repetitive nature of the film. With limited characterisation, everything basically amounts to one vicious attack after another, all of which are filmed in such a frenzied manner that it is impossible to keep track of what is going on. The film does at least recognise the irony of the premise and what one character says early on, ""we live out here for a little freedom"", echoes throughout."

I was hoping for an amazing story that would be told beautifully with no plot holes and stuff. Instead, I've found this cheesy but really cool movie. <br/><br/>All right, there are many moments in the movie that will make you say: ""Oh, come on! Who are you kidding?"", and you will definitely get mad at the characters for doing stupid things ( an accustomed cliché for scary movies I say. ""No, no, no! Do not f.cking go to check the f.cking upstairs!!!"" ), and you will easily realize the editing mistakes since there's absolutely no indicator that the time has passed except the claims made by the movie-makers with the subtitles reading: ""Day 7"" or ""Day 27"". I mean, according to me, all the movie took place in one night :) Poor character development and the general rushed-up feeling of the movie are some of the other low points. <br/><br/>However, the incredible atmosphere, the somehow-masterfully-managed realism, the gore, absolutely brave and surprising scenes (Someone doesn't care about the rating!), the breath-takingly-cool and scary vampires, the amazing bird's-eye view shot where we witness a total chaos and massacre, and the few amazing moments where we watch Ben Foster doing a swell job as always, makes this movie an amazing and obviously different vampire movie.<br/><br/>If you like vampires and scary movies, there's no way in hell you will get bored watching 30 Days Of Night. If you are one of those people who CAN enjoy cheesiness and clichés on top of it, this movie will be one of your favorites."
"Forever_21","6","0","0","6 February 2008"," A sick and twisted vampire yarn
","I enjoy vampire films and the first thing that struck me about this particular telling was how beautifully shot it is. This is in part thanks to the wonderful location: a small town in Alaska heralded as the northern most town in America. The film begins on the eve of the last day of sunshine before a month of natural darkness descends on the small town. Following an annual mass-exodus the town population is only a fraction of its pre- and post-darkness size and those that have chosen to stay behind (including a skeleton sheriff crew of two - Josh Hartnett and Manu Bennett) are effectively cut off from the rest of civilisation until the airport and roads reopen when the sun returns.<br/><br/>The suspense at this point is poised beautifully and David Slade does a wonderful job of setting up the anticipation of what is to come, which is effectively a free meal for the pack of vampires that descend on the town as darkness falls.<br/><br/>The vampires themselves are brilliantly conceived; they look horrific and speak in a suitably guttural language that (thankfully) isn't subtitled leaving you as a spectator trying to guess their intentions through their use of body language. This works brilliantly thanks to some top-draw performances from Danny Huston (Marlow) and Andrew Stehlin (Arvin). Just meeting either of these two down a dark alley would leave you babbling like a school-girl.<br/><br/>The stranger who descends on the town prior to the darkness is Marlow's familiar charged with prepping the town for the vampire's arrival and helping to add another dimension to the suspenseful build-up. The stranger is played by Ben Foster who puts in a good enough performance although his inconsistent accent does let him down.<br/><br/>The gore is outrageous and sometimes unnecessarily graphic and the pace of the film is about right although once the killing starts there isn't as much suspense as you would expect considering the build-up. However, this is a minor flaw in comparison to the biggest let-down in this film: Josh Hartnett. Clearly chosen to help increase audience size, Hartnett stumbles through his lines without conviction and never quite seems to fit into his role as the sheriff charged with protecting a town in chaos whilst dealing with the emotional turmoil of a wife (Melissa George played far more convincingly by Stella Oleson) who left him and is now forced into helping him protect the remaining citizens of the town. This emotionally-charged role was too far beyond Hartnett's reach.<br/><br/>There is one other issue with the film worth mentioning: although it takes place over 30 days, it never feels like it. By the end of the film you feel like 48 or 72 hours have past, Slade just doesn't manage to portray the longevity of their struggle for survival and is forced to flash 'Day 17' and 'Day 30' on screen to represent the passage of time. Unfortunately this and Hartnett drag this film from good to mediocre, which is a shame because Slade definitely has talent and I'll definitely be checking out his other directorial work."

Yet not two minutes later we see the two lead characters talking to each other on cell phones. If he missed those, he surely missed others.<br/><br/>The town's electricity goes out early in the film. A few people have generators. But when we go to the utility dome at the end, the lights are on and everything is running merrily. Why? The vampires go on a killing spree at the beginning of the film, for no obvious reason. Can they really eat that much all at once? This leaves a handful of people alive and hiding for the next month - first in an attic, then in a store, then the police station. All the while the vampires are creeping around outside. If they think they've eaten everyone, why are they still there? And if they haven't, why aren't they searching places like the store and the police station? They don't seem to have anything better to do. And why, in the final fight scene, do all the vampires just stand and watch while only one fights? Have they been watching too many martial arts films? And why, at the end, does Josh Hartnett not just go into the basement for a few hours? The film has other problems beside the plot holes. Much of the dialogue seems to come from some big Hackneyed Dialogue Generator. The pacing is jerky. For example, in one shot we see a person running to avoid detection by the vampires, and in the next shot the same person is almost sauntering, with no apparent distress about the possibility of being eaten alive if caught in the open. This happens over and over. And it doesn't help that most of the thirty days of the title are glossed over with screen cards like ""Day 7,"" which is immediately followed by ""Day 18,"" the main difference between the two being that Hartnett has grown a flimsy beard. Hartnett is wrong for the role, anyway. He doesn't have the gravity to carry off playing the take-charge sheriff. You sit wondering why the other people are, for the most part, unquestioningly following his instructions.<br/><br/>Finally there are the vampires themselves, who are hard to take seriously. They're probably supposed to look hip and goth. Instead, they look like they escaped from a mental institution to attend a Marilyn Manson concert. They have distorted eyes and walk around with their mouths hanging open all the time, so we can see their teeth. This gives them a sort of slack-jawed Down's Syndrome appearance. They're not very scary, but you feel guilty laughing at them; it feels like mocking the afflicted.<br/><br/>It's a shame about this movie. It could have been genuinely interesting. Too bad."

","Exceptional thriller directed by David Slade. Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost town in America is usually prepared for that time when the winter sun sets and doesn't come back up for 30 days and nights. Freezing wind blows the snow and from the darkness a group of strangers arrive; and they are very hungry, for they are an evil force to reckon with...they are vampires. Trying to combat this terror is Barrow's Sheriff(Josh Hartnett)and his estranged wife(Melissa George), a gun carrying state employee. They are part of a very small group of potential survivors that keeps getting smaller. Can they hold out until the next sunrise? I really liked the visuals of blowing snow and especially the aerial view of the bloody snow left by the bloodthirsty gang of vampires. The scenes of the blood suckers feeding are super. This is one of the best vampire flicks in quite a while. The finale is pretty stunning. Hartnett is very good. Ms. George proves to be talented and a looker. Also in the cast: Danny Huston, Joel Tobeck, Manu Bennett and Mark Boone Junior."

","From underdeveloped characters, to choppy editing, to some bad lines, it's got a lot going wrong. But however bad that may sound, somehow, the movie still remains to be alluring. The vampires have a certain charm to them, even when looking disgusting and disturbing/creepy. Though their feeding frenzy and torture route may make them a bit unlikable, you have about an hour to deal with them and find either things you like, or dislike. It's a good movie overall, the more minor characters being a bit more desirable then Hartnett or George at times, but that's only because they were given a bad script to work with. Their acting is on par, but Ben Foster, he deserves an early career Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the stranger. A self deluded martyr to the vampires. A lap dog if you will. <br/><br/>The best part about the movie, unmistakably is the gore and the way they go about showing it off here and there. The best part about it is they play with it. A splatter of blood here, trail of blood there, chop a head off every - let's say fifteen minutes, and then we'll just go WILD EVERY HALF HOUR! And then blood just starts flying. A favorite is probably going to be the vampires vs. the snow plow, which you will see in the future. <br/><br/>Now the problems start occurring when Eben (Hartnett) gets back from finding one of the town mates decapitated. Although everyone puts on a great show, the mortal danger just never seems real. It feels like you know who's next every single time, and with so many people to kill, it's a wonder they didn't just use a bomb, WAIT! It's a vampire movie. They need the blood. But they do break some things and set it all on fire in the end to cover up their tracks. <br/><br/>It's a warm hearted movie in a cold place, where the end lacks a good beat down, but we still get to watch the sunrise together. See it if you have the time, but there is no rush here. Unless you're running..."

","After seeing the commercial for this movie a thousand times I just had to see it. As a matter of fact, the line ""No God"" would have been reason enough for me to watch this movie. Fortunately the rest of the movie was also rather entertaining, but not more than that.<br/><br/>We've seen it all before. A group of survivors being killed off one by one until only a few given surviving characters are left. It includes people sacrificing themselves, some being ""turned"" and of course some people that just cant keep it together and makes a totally irrational decision and gets themselves killed. Where have we seen this? Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, The Hills Have Eyes and Resident Evil, just to mention a few, have a terribly similar segment and concept; disaster strikes and they all spread out and die one by one.<br/><br/>What annoys me about these movies is that it's always the same. Why can't a horror movie contain a group of people that don't suicide or freak out? I've never been attacked by a vampire myself, but I really don't think I would have ran towards the bastard! Bearing this in mind, I never really enjoyed my time in the movie theater. The blood was overdone and the screeches from the vampires was a pain in the ass. The acting, the violence, the cutting (the scenes)and even the dialogs were OK, but for God's sakes! We've seen it all before! The movie was very hyped up and unfortunately I expected so much more when I went to see it. Too commercialized and mainstream for my taste.<br/><br/>I would have given it a 5, but since the actors (and especially Josh Hartnett) did such a good job, I think a weak 6/10 is in order."

"Caliber345","7","4","13","18 October 2007"," Fresh take on vampires, but everything in between is stale
","I work for a movie theatre and had to screen the print prior to public viewing for technical concerns. I enjoy vampire lore and films, though I've learned to go into movies expecting nothing. 30 Days of Night didn't deliver entirely what I was expecting, but I know this: too many people that work for studios come here and hype these movies. Yes, opinions vary greatly, and I am usually on here defending everyone's right to like what they choose, but the first comment is just not accurate. First, the vampires are the stars of the show. Their appearance, mannerisms, and language are well done. I enjoyed the different take on them, though watching it I knew they were vampires; nothing radical was done to usher the next century of the thirsty undead in. Kudos.<br/><br/>But that is about all that is new here. Other than the cinematography (which I enjoyed; lots of gray reinforced the isolated and hopeless feeling the survivors are meant to endure), the acting (Josh Hartnett is faithfully forgettable as usual), casting, and plot are invisible. Several subplots are hinted at for each character, but one quick line is all we get, and then one quick line later in the film resolves it. Picking out who is going to die and when is easy. Small moments that most movies hint at to foreshadow later events are like floodlights in a closet here. Whenever you see something apparently random, you'll know where it's going right away. Nothing new is added beyond what we expect; 30 days of night in a town that vampires have come to ravage. Which, if you are paying $9.50 to see, then you should be fine. The bottom line is I did like the film. Seeing free movies makes me ask myself, ""Would I have been satisfied paying $9.50 to see that?"" In this case, yes, I would. But the overzealous hype-machine in the first review is just not what you are going to get with this film. <br/><br/>If you like vampires, and gore (it does get bloody), then you will like this film. If you just want something that won't make you think but will give you a visual thrill, you'll be fine. If you're looking for something deeper in the plot, or tons of epic action sequences, then carefully reconsider before laying down your greenbacks at the Box Office. <br/><br/>Again, to each their own. We all like different things (I can't count how many blogs I've defended The Matrix in, lol). Yet the level of skill in the first review is surely that of a professional critic, and goes a bit too far in stating what this movie really is."

The vampires let him live at one point and then they come back and - kill him. Why did they let him live? Why did they kill him? What was his purpose in being? Apparently he was some sort of vampire-slave, but there's no telling how that came about.<br/><br/>In fact there are only three type of human characters in the film, the dumb, the underused, and the screaming. There's a lot of screaming in this film.<br/><br/>Admittedly the camera-work and editing are quite good. But without believable, appealing characters, there's no real story here.

","I have never been a huge fan of Josh Hartnett but I will give him credit for doing an above average job in the role of his character, in other words, without Hartnett...this movie would have completely bombed. There are way too many 'cheap scares', for instance, a victim is walking at a distance and all of the sudden there is a black figure that flashes by on the screen (very closely I might add) accompanied by a thunderous thud noise thats incorporated to create the grisly 'cheap scare' that usually will get a jump out of people (people that haven't seen this trick a million times before that is). There are a lot of questions left unanswered to me, such as, what is the vampires' business in Barrow, Alaska? (Besides the 30 days of night thing which I can understand), is the rest of the world in chaos because of these vamps? I would have appreciated a little more of a background on their history so I could fully understand the whole spectrum of things, but maybe I'm asking for too much huh? There are too many people being introduced (without names of course) which further complicates the character development issue. We just see their faces and some brief dialogue but for the most part these people are introduced so quickly that when they do get attacked, we don't really have anything to care for them about, kinda like their just cardboard cutouts being sucked dry of their blood. The CG effects are just ridiculous, they are in an abundance folks! I in short did not find this movie A. scary B. suspenseful or C. intriguing by any standard, the only one thing holding the reins together for this film is, yes folks, Josh Hartnett. 3 out of 10 stars because of Hartnett's performance alone."
"drownnnsoda","9","3","9","21 October 2007"," Excellent Vampire Film, and One of the Best Horror Movies of the Year.
","""30 Days Of Night"" centers on the small, rural Alaskan town of Barrow. Each year, the 'city at the top of world' is plunged into one month of darkness, void of any sunlight. Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett), the town sheriff, looks over the snow-covered, close-knit community. On the last day of sunlight, a stranger (Ben Foster) arrives in town, babbling about the darkness and what is yet to come. Eben and his estranged wife, Stella (Melissa George), also a law-enforcer, think nothing of the man's rantings. But when a group of vampires arrive in town, with a thirty day feast ahead of them, it seems this stranger knows more than they assumed. As the vampires suck the life out of everyone in the town, Eben, Stella, and a group of others are the only ones left alive... but can they survive the next thirty days before they become victims of the blood-drinking creatures? <br/><br/>Based on the graphic novel, ""30 Days Of Night"" is likely one of the scariest and best horror movies to come out this year. Most horror fans know that the horror genre hasn't seen a genuinely good vampire film in quite some time. I can't think of one in the past ten years that has been anything above average. But, if you've been waiting for a good vampire movie, you've got it right here. The most impressive thing about this film to me was the construction of the setting for the film, and the catch to it all - the fact that there is no sunlight for thirty days, which basically gives vampires an endless smörgåsbord. And while the credit for this does go to the writer of the graphic novel, this film was very well made, and managed to stay fairly unpredictable and consistently suspenseful.<br/><br/>It begins fairly steady, but when the night begins to fall and the thirty days of darkness arrives, things begin to kick and the story is wound tight with plenty of tensity. The atmosphere was very good, the isolated setting worked perfectly and the extremely cold, snowy backdrop is an unusual but chilling setting for this type of film. The jolts are well-executed and the suspense factor is high. David Slade, who directed the magnificent thriller ""Hard Candy"", directs this film as well, and I thought he did a great job here. The cinematography was excellent and there are some really great shots in this film, among them being a breathtaking birds-eye view of the town as it's being ransacked by the vampires, who have left large pools of red snow throughout the streets. The vampires themselves are grotesque and downright scary looking, and are nearly half creature-like. Not only that, but they also have their own language, which is translated with subtitles.<br/><br/>Each of our characters are fairly well written, too, and all of them were very well acted. Josh Harntett leads the cast as the film's hero whose job is to take care of everyone else. He's convincing in the action scenes and with emotion, and does a great job. Melissa George plays his estranged wife in somewhat of a tough-girl role, and she's excellent as well. Rounding out the cast is Ben Foster, who really surprised me in his performance as the filthy drifter who has a connection with the vampires, Mark Rendall playing Hartnett's teenage brother, and Danny Huston as Marlow, the leader of the bloodsuckers. I thought the ending was brilliant and very unpredictable and unexpected.<br/><br/>Overall, ""30 Days Of Night"" is an exceptional recent entry into the vampire sub-genre, and it provides one frightening ride that is worth the price of theater admission. It has an original story, some great scares, and stunning cinematography to boot. It isn't your usual vampire movie, and for fans of vampire flicks, it will be a refreshing and scary experience. Well worth seeing, especially during the Halloween season. I can say it's one of the best horror movies of the year thus far. 9/10."

"seawalker","5","2","5","11 November 2007"," Not what it could have been
","Barrow, Alaska. The most Northerly town in the United States. During the longest night of the year (er... that would be the '30 days of night' of the title) a group of vampires descend on the town, feeding on everyone that they can find. A group of people, led by an young sheriff, fight to survive the onslaught. Will these people make it until daybreak? Ah... Well that is the question. You will have to see the movie to find out, won't you?<br/><br/>Frankly, I think the above setup for a horror movie is absolutely fantastic and brilliant and original (until somebody tells me that it has been done before) and I was really looking forward to seeing it. Plenty of scope for an full blooded ""Dawn Of The Dead"" battle-for-survival-against-incredible-odds, kind of a movie. It is such a shame that the execution of the idea left so much to be desired.<br/><br/>Yes, the vampires are truly fantastic creations. Evil, gross, vicious, animal like mutations. Danny Huston, as their (Hungarian speaking?) almost philosophical leader, is great and made me shiver every time he appeared on screen. There is wonderful cinematography, in the latter stages focusing on the white of the snow and the red of the blood, and some brilliant scene construction, showing at a distance the carnage and mayhem on the ground. But, sadly and possibly inevitably, ""30 Days Of Night"" commits the cardinal sin of any horror movie. When the monsters' are not on screen, it is really boring and slow.<br/><br/>Maybe it is down to the cast. I don't know. I didn't find them interesting. ""Hard Candy"" proves that David Slade can direct a pacy, interesting film with a minimal cast, when that cast is good. (That film is practically a two hander throughout.) I must say that even as a longstanding Josh Harnett apologist (I like him, really I do), I felt that his performance this time is particularly vacant and definitely nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>""30 Days Of Night"" is not terrible, but it is not what it could have been."
"paulmamak","6","2","5","3 November 2007"," One of the better recent vampire films.
","30 Days of Night was overall a good film. The overall atmosphere of its setting in Alaska gave the film that extra edge. This is emphasised in opening scene where you see Ben Forster's character emerge from the cruise liner, which had to be one of the best screen shots throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Ben Forster as ""The Stranger"" is one of his best acting performances to date, he pulled it off very convincingly and built up the suspense and tension very well.<br/><br/>The suspense remains partially strong throughout the emergence of the vampires as darkness falls. This remains strong as some of the first victims are targeted and reaches a climatic moment when you see the whole town fall into complete havoc as the vampires unleash their hunger upon the locals. This scene remains truly memorable as the camera pans out above the town where you see victims being targeted, as well as vampires being shot at.<br/><br/>It is up to the emergence of the vampires that the tension goes, they do not seem a threat to look at. The only thing they possess are jagged teeth, widened pupils, long sharp fingernails, some have hooked noses and to make themselves look more surreal they do not bother wiping their mouths. Throughout the film you realise they dress in a goth-like fashion, other than Danny Huston's character who looks like a middle-aged business man. They also think they are a threat as they constantly shriek, believe me it was more annoying than scary. The worst vampire had to be the little girl in the convenience store, who mutters a line very similar to most evil doing children like all horror films.<br/><br/>The overall time scale was not emphasised, as it seemed like the circumstances only took place over a period of a day than 30 days.<br/><br/>Unlike most horror films, a lot of the characters were truly effected by the deaths. Josh Hartnett, unlike most heroic characters, sheds the odd tear for some of the victim's, to the death of character's he was probably very close to. Manu Bennett's acting was incredible, he remained utterly heartbroken when he killed his wife and daughters that had been transformed.<br/><br/>As the film draws to an end though, it goes slightly off the rails. Due to Josh Hartnett purposely transforming himself into a vampire to save his wife, who looked like she was safe enough. The death of Danny Huston's character was also sudden and unexpected, a bit of a let down there.<br/><br/>The film ends well though with the Hartnett and George watching the sunset together only for Hartnett to burn to dust.<br/><br/>Overall, a fairly enjoyable film, it is more suitable for persons though that are more interested in the genre though."
"aicfan85","7","2","5","2 November 2007"," Best Vampire movies in some time!
","Having read the graphic novel in which this movie was inspired and not being very impressed (good concept, not very good anything else) , I was still optimistic for this movie adaptation. Director David Slade has made me happy in the past with his work in the disturbing film Hard Candy. Though Hard Candy deals with a real life monster (pedophiles), in 30 Days of Night Slade manages to fully realize supernatural horror and revitalize the vampire genre in a way not seen since the first Blade.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a fighting husband and wife played by the dreadfully dead-pan Josh Hartnett (who is the only ""name"" actor in the movie)and the equally boring Melissa George. Hartnett is the sheriff of a small isolated town in Alaska called Barrow and his soon to be ex wife, along with half of the town, are leaving because Barrow is about to see its last sunset in 30 days. However, his wife gets in an accident with a local tractor and decides to begrudgingly stay in town and help Hartnett with some strange cases of vandalism. These vandalism's include every police dog being ripped to sheds, every cell phone in the town being stolen, only to be found burnt to a crisp, and the towns radio/power being shut off, leaving Barrow unable to communicate with the rest of the world. After a violent run in with an accented visiting vagrant, we soon figure out what's really going on. It seems traveling vampires have singled out Barrow Alaska and are exploiting its 30 days without the sunlight. Needless to say this movie gets violent fast, never pulls its punches, and can be adequately described as f***** up.<br/><br/>Though the movie starts slow and there is some less than great acting as well as some overly simplistic dialogue, once the movie picks up it quickly brings you to the edge of your seat hiding behind your palms. Not only is this a good vampire movie, but a truly effective horror movie in general. Though I previously compare this movie with the more action/martial arts oriented Blade, this movie is far more chilling and adult. At times the violence was so unbearable and viscous I found my self wincing away from the screen (not easy for me anymore), other times the violence was handled more strategically off camera. Regardless, which ever way it was dealt with, the decision was made with how best to scare/disturb the audience. Also, unlike Anne Rice's beautiful homo-erotic vampires, these monsters are more like a pack of demonic wolves who will remind you why you thought Marilyn Manson was creepy when you were a kid. This Combined with the best aspects of Romero-esk zombie survival and the isolative snowy terror of John Carpenters The Thing makes 30 Days the best vampire movie in a very long time. However, the movie does have a somewhat disappointing ending (unfortunately one of few things that wasn't changed from the book) but it still manages to work in the end."

","I have been waiting for years to see a vampire movie where there weren't erotic undertones. I know why this became part of the standard mythology, but I never much cottoned to it. From an evolutionary point of view, vampires are predators, and I guess I would prefer to see them act like it. I don't need posturing. I don't need sadistic/masochistic sex, or the ""goth"" type tragedy of it all. I like the idea of a vampire that revels in his/her horrific nature. And we see that here in spades.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie omits the conflict between elder and younger vampires which is large motivational factor in the graphic novel. That conflict between old school/world vampires and new school/world vampires actually plays out in the book. Tragedy v. Tyranny. It was a great aspect to the book, and would have helped give context to the vampires attacking this town.<br/><br/>As to the movie itself, I thought it was nicely constructed and kept on moving, concentrating on the isolation, and tension felt by the people of the town. The supporting characters weren't given much to work with, and dropped like flies one by one, but they were sympathetic in their ways.<br/><br/>I was finally impressed by something Josh Hartnett has done. And Melissa George was good for a strong female lead. We need more fighters and fewer screamers on the feminine front in movies.<br/><br/>And Unlike some folks I've spoken with, I had no problem with the screaming vampires. As predators, they address the beasts within themselves in that way. Works for me."

","Like most people, I went to this movie not really expecting much. Vampire movies are really losing their mystique and people aren't as enthusiastic about them.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night was an excellent new take on vampires. They aren't the beautiful, mysterious creatures that you read about in books or see in movies. They're brutal, vicious, bloodthirsty, and terrifying.<br/><br/>The cinematography reminded me of the color contrasts featured in Sin City and 300, which really emphasized the transition from graphic novel to film. Blood really stands out, so if you're uneasy about gore, probably not the movie for you. I loved it, however, and I would recommend it."

It wasn't as scary as I had hoped it would be; there weren't any scenes that made me jump or anything (but then I'm sort of hard to scare) more of a thriller/gorefest than something to frighten, but it didn't suck. Definitely wouldn't recommend taking children to see this one, as it were rather gory, & had a great deal of violence & language. <br/><br/>Overall, it was a good, gory movie, and had some moments to freak you out; it just wasn't very scary."

","I usually get bored with movies, so if I can sit through it and not daydream I consider that a great start. Anyway, I went into this not expecting much. Sam Raime's Ghost House Pictures has a reputation for churning out some real crap as far as horror movies go. Josh Hartnet doesn't generally aspire awe with his acting abilities. Melissa George is known in most circles for her looks more than anything else. I was thinking at worst I could catch a 2-hour nap. However. The movie was actually pretty good. The direction and cinematography was great. Hartnett seemed like he'd matured a bit as an actor. He did a fine job. Melissa George has come leaps and bounds since the small parts I remember her from. She was great. Ben Foster is always good to see, and he's turning into a hell of a character actor (check him out in 3:10 to Yuma.) The guy who played the vampire ""leader"" or ""president"" or ""president elect"" or whatever they call it was really really good. Apparently his dad is John Huston too, which seems odd, but he was brilliant. All in all the vampires did a great job. All in all definitely worth watching (and you can't say that about more than 2 or 3 horror films a year these days.)"
"rparham","7","2","5","22 October 2007"," An effective Night
","30 Days of Night has a premise that seems undeniably suited for a vampire movie: in Alaska resides a town named Barrow, the northernmost city of the United States. During winter, for 30 days, the sun never rises, bathing the city in a perpetual darkness during that period. Comic book creators Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith used this as the basis for their tale of a group of vampires that arrive in Barrow to feed for those 30 days on the unwitting, and largely trapped, populace of Barrow. Director David Slade has now brought the tale to the big screen, and while it is hardly a perfect horror film, it is a cut above many others in some time and provides the appropriate thrills for the audience.<br/><br/>As stated above, the setting is Barrow, beginning the day before the 30 day sunless cycle kicks off. Sheriff Eben (Josh Harnett) spends that last day investigating a number of unusual occurrences around the town: burned cell phones, murdered sled dogs, the only helicopter damaged beyond repair. As the sun sets, the town finds itself cut off from the rest of the world, and quickly under siege, as vampires have arrived at Barrow and begin feeding on the population, first just a few on the outskirts of town, but eventually moving en masse. Finding guns incapable of stopping the attackers, a group of survivors, led by Eben, and including his estranged wife, Stella (Melissa George) hole up in an attic and lay the groundwork for surviving the seemingly endless darkness.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night is not scary in a traditional sense. Even with some scenes of suspense, the film instead relies on the adrenaline rush of watching the survivors attempt to avoid detection by the undead, who utilize their stealth and the bait of other survivors to try to lure their prey into the open. The vampires are appropriately creepy, covered in blood from their victims, and attack with a ravenousness that vampires have typically lacked in previous screen appearances. These vampires are monsters, pure and simple, and that is reflected in several scenes where they confront their prey and fill the audience with unease since we are relatively certain the humans will not survive.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that 30 Days of Night is not a character-driven piece, Slade still manages to evoke a degree of feeling and sympathy for his human protagonists. The film deals in the sticky territory of who lives and who dies when faced against seemingly insurmountable odds, and also the questions of whether the choices made, even when the outcome seems obvious, are the right ones from a moral standpoint. 30 Days of Night is not some treatise on the human condition, it is still a horror thriller, but the fact that it takes the time to consider the issues is better than we usually get from a film of its genre.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, the cast is solid, if not amazing. Josh Hartnett is appropriately stolid as Sheriff Eben, but also manages to communicate his desire to try and keep those around him alive while his world seems to be unraveling at the same time. Danny Huston portrays the vampire leader, Marlow, and while he is not given anything in the way of English dialogue (the vampires speak in some subtitled foreign language), he conveys an appropriate sense of meance.<br/><br/>Visually, 30 Days of Night is effective, showing the dark world of Barrow, and director Slade and cinematographer Jo Willems do a good job of conveying dread by often populating the edges of the screen with the vampires lurking, ready to strike. The makeup effects that realize the vampires keeps them appropriately evil, but the work in this department is hardly groundbreaking.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night is no masterpiece, and Slade's previous effort, the disturbing Hard Candy, was a much better movie, but nonetheless, 30 Days of Night is effective and efficient, so if you like horror films, it's worth checking out."
"mikal9300","8","2","5","22 October 2007"," Town in Alaska, 30 days of night, blood thirsty vampires... almost priceless
","30 DAYS OF NIGHT<br/><br/>30 Days of Night abandons the cliché of the Romantic vampire and instead dives right into their primal nature. <br/><br/>A town in Alaska, last sunset before being plunged into 30 days of darkness, a pack of bloodthirsty vampires... almost priceless. Being that I am an avid vampire film fan and love the allure of vampires in general, I was very pleased with this film. It puts a welcome twist on the vampire and we see them here as more a pack of wolves crying out their morbid call once they attack and feed on their prey. They attack their victims by slashing their sharp nails into their victims like a meat cleaver. They would also use a single victim as bait letting them walk the town crying out for help as they stalked along the roof tops. They even have their own primal language with noises and clicks. The look of a few the vampires was eerie, they had narrow and elongated faces with closely placed and angled eyes. I feel that all of the vampires should have had this look. <br/><br/>The setting is a great one if you are a vampire, no sun for 30 days gives you a constant feeding frenzy not having to worry about the rise of the sun. This is what gives the film it's edge. You are right there on the edge of your seat watching and wondering how these poor townsfolk who are cut off from the rest of the world for 30 days will survive when they don't even have the hope to survive until morning when the sun comes up. <br/><br/>This was almost a great film. Lots of blood and killing, a new approach to the vampire, a great setting and tense scenes throughout. The only thing this movie lacked was a little bit in the set up but I'm not sure it is really needed. However, we never find out where these vampires come from and how they got to Alaska. But the thing that really kills this films greatness is the ending. It just ends! Where did the vampires go and why, they just disappeared. It seems like the writer took the easy way out. Even though the ending was lame I still rank this as a must see and a must buy once the DVD comes out, my overall rating 8 of 10."
"justinnnis","5","2","5","21 October 2007"," Severely Disappointing
","Let me start off by saying, I was very excited to see this movie. I have been counting down the days all month until the release of 30 Days of Night. Who wouldn't be after the amazing TV spots and Sam Raimi producing the picture? Well, unfortunately this movie was a let down. The movie starts off slow and continues on this path for pretty much the entire time you're in the theater. There is essentially no back-story or character development. After reading an interview with Melissa George where she stated that they spent a lot of time with character development, I was under the impression there was going to be almost too much. Alas, there was virtually none. At times, the story seems very inconsistent with the way characters act. However, I was very impressed with the cinematography. The snow and ice were beautifully shot and the town was everything a gritty, Alaskan town should be. Unfortunately, this was one of very few enjoyable parts of the movie. Admittedly, it does pick up the last 20 minutes of the movie; but by this time, you have already lost interest. If you do buy tickets to this movie, come an hour late: this is the only way to somewhat salvage the experience. Wait until this movie comes out on DVD."
"kenpo1970","7","2","5","21 October 2007"," Good but not great.
","I am kind of on the fence about this one. First, I must admit that I have always been a fan of vampire films and I thought the concept for this movie (graphic novel) was a great. Secondly, the movie did definitely creep me out and have my on the egde of my seat. This in many ways the ultimate nightmare scenario, not quite on the level of Salem's Lot, but close. Finally, I think this will be a worthy addition to my DVD collection for a good watch on Halloween once a year, be warned though, this film is graphic. But I can't say this movie isn't without flaws.<br/><br/>If you are expecting anything in the way of character development you can just forget it. Showing the relationships seems to serve only the purpose of showing us why character A might care why character B gets slaughtered, but you wont care. Also, I just felt it would have been more interesting to learn a little bit more about these vampires, where they came from and why they decided to take this town right now. They were scary enough but a little more back story would have gone a long way. There were also just seemed to be some obvious questions.<br/><br/>Like why wouldn't these vampires just call it a day and head to the next town after their initial slaughter. Why the heck would they hang out for thirty days just looking for a few additonal ""snacks"" when according to the characters there were evidently some other towns in the vicinity, probably not a problem for these super human vampires to reach. And if there were a lot of people still alive that they were holding in reserve or as bait it might have been interesting to show that part of it.<br/><br/>As I said this isn't a bad film but it's a toss up as to whether you want to wait for the DVD. If you are a big horror fan or love vampire flicks this wouldn't be a complete waste of your money but if not you probably just want to wait and give it a rent."
"kenziej_1973","9","2","5","21 October 2007"," Haunting setting, nuanced performances, and absolutely gory (possible spoilers)
","I suppose horror fanatics (like myself) are jaded in our requirements -- decent plot line, intriguing villains, heroes to sympathize with, a good amount of scares and a bit of the red stuff thrown in for good measure, when and where the film needs it. <br/><br/>30 Days of Night, while not particularly heavy on the jump-and-go-Boo! moments (there were a few here and there), bordered on the traumatic. The icy, bleak setting of Barrow, the northernmost town of the U.S., allowed for the moviegoer to immediately feel the utter isolation experienced regularly by the town's residents. As prepared as the (remaining) denizens may have seemed for the month-long's worth of darkness, they simply weren't quite prepared enough for the vicious gang of vampires able to withstand the sub-zero temperatures. <br/><br/>David Slade's direction was phenomenal. His focus was less on needless exposition and more on character reaction, audience perspective, setting, timing and mood -- from the spectacularly devised aerial shot of the vampire slaughter-fest of the town to the facial expressions of the exhausted remaining survivors as they find themselves faced with the inevitable, bloodily sacrificial decisions. <br/><br/>The casting was surprisingly good as well. I'm not a Josh Harnett fan, but as the young, local lawman, Eben, he handled his role thoughtfully, as did his female co-star, Melissa George as Stella, Eben's estranged wife. The knockouts, however, were Ben Foster as the creepy Stranger (the Renfield of the story, I'm assuming) and Danny Huston as Marlowe, the Slavic- tongued, nastily philosophical leader of the vampires. Both Foster and Huston are fantastic character actors, the likes of whom are seen sporadically in memorable roles. I don't think either of them will be short of work in Hollywood. I hope not, at any rate.<br/><br/>All in all, 30 Days of Night is a worthy watch. Be prepared to be chilled to the core."

","Based on the graphic novel, which I haven't read, 30 days of Night has some effective moments, good acting, intense scenes and great visuals, but it still isn't quite up there with the better vampire movies.<br/><br/>Barrow, Alaska, the northern most town in the US, is plunged into 30 days of darkness. Taking advantage of the lack of sunlight for 30 days, a gang of lethal and nasty vampires descend upon the town to feast on the living. It is up to the local sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) to protect the town's dwindling populace against certain destruction.<br/><br/>There are quite a lot of effective moments in 30 Days of Night. I like the look of the film as well as the look of the vampires. There are quite a few good scenes as well, but one of the best, and many have stated it here already, is the aerial view of the vampires attacking many of the town's folk who try to fight back with weapons that just don't work on vampires.<br/><br/>The acting for a horror movie is also quite good. I actually cared about the good guys. Both Josh Harnett and Melissa George were very effective in their roles, as were the secondary characters. I also have to give the lead villain his due as well. Danny Huston, as the lead vampire Marlow was good. Ben Foster also appears in the movie. He is only known as the Stranger, but he comes to Barrow with a mission as well, which I won't disclose for it may be a minor spoiler.<br/><br/>30 Days of night has a lot of good points, but I felt as if some scenes moved a little to slow, and there were some points in the movie that went nowhere. I think if the film had been shorter it would've been better, but these weren't the points that really bothered me as much as two of the characters that do things that make little sense. I can see why they did what they did, but why do things that make it easier for the vampires to get you. One character does something that was a little crazy, but not as disappointing as that of another character. The latter character does something even more far fetched at the end, which leads to a fight sequence which I found hard to swallow. Yes I've heard that this scene is in the graphic novel. Maybe it works in there, but what always works in a graphic comic doesn't always work in a movie. Still, 30 Days of Night was better then most horror films. At least it wasn't just torture porn like so many other films. I think if you are a horror fan you will enjoy this movie. I will award it a C+."
"warsunset","1","4","14","30 October 2007"," Huge disappointment
","30 Days of Night left me with many unanswered questions. I would have like to have seen some information on the origin of these vampires. I think every vampire enthusiast appreciates the origin of the vampire and I believe that the origin is what truly sets Vampire plots apart. Yes, we know they feed on blood. We also know that their favorite place to bite is the neck. They have superhuman powers and are very difficult to kill. Same story many different versions. I was not impressed with the role the leader of the vampire played. His gurgled language wasn't very convincing, the under-bite was poorly conceived and there were too many unnecessary growls. The only difference I saw in this movie was the location the vampires chose to feed. I felt more moved by the barren and cold location than the anticipation of a vampire attack.

","30 Day's of Night sucked on so many levels, it's not even funny. Don't get me wrong, I loved the comics, but this movie was vile. Not in the good way either...<br/><br/>The story was horrid. Even though the man behind the comics, Steve Niles, wrote the screenplay it couldn't have been farther from the original story line. There must have been two scenes, TWO SCENES, that were the same between the comics and movies. Why? The comics were practically story boards to what should have been done! And the comics were good, that's why they sold well. They shouldn't have strayed so far from the source material...<br/><br/>The so called ""Special Effects"" were bad. Really, Really, Really, bad. The CGI was so painfully obvious that it hurt. 30 Day's of Night is like watching a hyper-violent ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". One scene in particular sticks out. Eben and his ex-girlfriend (Who should be his wife if it followed the f#%king comics!) are driving in their car, when a ""Vampire"" hops on the roof. The Animators were so lazy, that they didn't even give the vampire a face. It was just a shadow on their car. I've seen better animations in Pokemon.<br/><br/>The acting, I didn't really have much hope for this seeing as Josh Harnett was cast in the lead. But, I will say he did a pretty good job as Eben. However, everybody else was vile. Nobody showed any emotion in their voice, none. It was like the Director hired his closest friends to do the job.<br/><br/>Skip this movie at all costs. Maybe it's just because of my high expectations, but this movie ranks along with Uwe Boll's House of the Dead as one of the worst movies ever made. If you really, really, really, really, like vampires you might like it. Anyone else though, avoid like the plague."
"danjocross","2","2","6","3 September 2013"," Such a promising premise, such a stupid movie
","I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time because the premise was so interesting. I was hoping for something like the terrifying claustrophobia and geographic trap that made John Carpenter's The Thing so scary. But, uh, no. Not at all! <br/><br/>I started to realize that this was going to be a bad film after about 60 seconds, when the two cops trudge across a vast wasteland of snow to examine . . . a little black spot in the snow--a pile of burnt cell phones. How did they know this little pile of burnt phones was out there in the vastness? Oh don't even ask, because it is only the first of dozens of just irritatingly stupid logical flaws that plague this movie!<br/><br/>The brain-numbing logical flaws just never end! Where did these ""vampires"" come from before the sun went down for a month? Where do they go the other 11 months of the year? (some snow cave, perhaps? an igloo?) And then to learn that they have been around for centuries makes it even more baffling. Who in the hell have they been eating all that time? Inuit people? Where did the head vampire get that nice modern suit he's wearing? Perhaps he stole it from someone on the Shackleford expedition? And why is the suit and his white collared shirt so spotless at the start of the film, especially since these ""vampires"" have such horrid hygiene--none of them ever seem to wipe their mouths, so that each of them walks around for the whole movie with what looks like beard of red blood all over the lower half of their face. Which is funny because none of the ""vampires"" are ever shown actually EATING the people they kill. They may growl and rip open someone's neck, but they never seem particularly interested in, you know, actually drinking blood. You'd think they'd have more of an appetite after hibernating (or whatever they do) for the last 11 months. In fact, I watched the whole movie without ever understanding what the ""vampires"" actually WANTED. If it was actually just food, that would have been so much better; if they crept in like predators and dragged humans off into the darkness to devour them, that would have been scary. But they don't. They just seem to stumble around and hiss without even really eating anybody. <br/><br/>Even the setting is a disappointment, because you never get any sense of emptiness or isolation; the set looks more like a small town in an old western movie (shot on a studio back lot). And speaking of darkness . . . well it isn't. There is always so much light on everyone at every moment in the movie it makes you wonder who strung up all the Klieg lights all over town and what keeps them running even after the ""vampires"" disable the power plant. <br/><br/>The editing is also a disaster. Every ""scary"" moment is cut to pieces to attempt to make it look exciting or shocking, but it does not help. It just makes you think constantly about the editing, and the fact that you are watching a movie, and a bad one at that. Even the sound design is hilariously bad; there are sounds of a screaming, whistling wind over shots where there are just a few lazy snowflakes slowly falling. <br/><br/>Perhaps most maddening is the syrupy and heavy handed love story with the two impossibly- pretty-for-Alaska lead characters, Eben and Stella (neither of whom you can ever imagine living in such a place as Barrow). You know this story is going to be nauseating and overly obvious when one of the minor characters says to the pretty blond Stella, ""Me and Jennie were hoping you and Eben would rethink this whole separation thing."" And this (SPOILER ALERT!) is actually the only bit of suspense in this silly movie: are Stella and Eben going to reconcile??? Yep, every sappy emotion is spelled out for the slow people (and teenagers, the obvious target audience for this film) in the theater--except for any hint about the reason they separated. They are both so perfectly pretty and virtuous with no character flaws or skin blemishes, you can't imagine why they weren't happy together. <br/><br/>Finally, the climax of the movie is so disastrously illogical on top of all the other nonsensical things that come before it (SPOILER ALERT! Even though the main characters repeatedly run out into the street to save each other and never get caught by the superhumanly fast vampires, at the end, the only way Eben can save Stella is to BECOME one of the vampires so he can have a man-to- man fistfight with the lead vampire while all the others form a circle and watch from a respectful distance like some bad John Wayne movie. Oh god. It's all so senseless. <br/><br/>I joined IMDb so I could write this review and others like it because I want to try to steer people away from movies like this. Don't encourage them with your money, people!!! There are so many better more worthy movies you could be spending your money on! If you want to be scared, check out The Thing, or REC, two of the scariest, most claustrophobic movies I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading!"

"onepotato2","3","2","6","5 April 2009"," Just a way to pass the time
","The last 3 decades of vampire movies have usually needed to tap into something else in the culture to find relevance. Frank Langela's Dracula introduced a yuppie-stud vampire conceived to soothe female horniness, and cashed in on the play's success. The Lost Boys toyed with vampire gang violence. Copola/Stokers Dracula exploited blood fears and the HIV virus, Van Helsing tried an action movie makeover to tap into the success of the Mummy franchise (It failed). Almost everyone of the others use a recognizable ""drug addiction"" arc... i.e. the vampires behave like junkies, as here.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night takes one original overall gimmick (vampires above the Arctic Circle) and forgets to supplement it with other supporting ideas. It's structured hap-hazardly so the 30 days feel no different as a timeframe, than a movie that covers 4 days. I'm continually amazed that there are always funds available to make more vampire movies, since there's really only one vampire movie and they just keep making it over and over. Only the surface style changes. They haven't been scary in decades. (Are we even capable of being scared by movies anymore?) Here, the whole show is carnage. And it lazily borrows motifs introduced in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the latest wave of zombie movies & Buffy. <br/><br/>30 Days of Night is sad evidence that surface activity reigns. As a culture we've become full time pushers of design and style to the degree that certain movie-goers are now merely design and style consumers; frontal lobes with legs and the cash for a ticket. Horror movies are designed, rather than thoughtfully conceived. Is there time to write a good script? Um, sorry no... we're waaaay too busy designing the credit sequence, and we have to pick out the right contact lenses and teeth for the vampires so they look rilly kewl! Then we have to overdesign the kills so they're kewl. And then we're on to the poster cause that has to look kewl. With tasks like those eating up brainpower, movies like ""30 Days"" never get around to content or depth."

The comic origins are evident both for the vampire look and for the Niles scrip. The settings is good and so are the visual effects, especially in the scene of a head chopped off. Some scenes, especially in the beginning are not so bad and scare. But as the plot goes on it turns in some nonsense. The weak point is the screenplay by Niles himself. Deplorable, illogical, sometime ridiculous. You spend almost all the time asking why all characters do just what they are not supposed to do. And the end is really stupid, an insult to anyone's intelligence. Besides I just don't like the recent way of filming horror and thriller with a fast editing and many confused close ups in the action scenes. I don't recommend this film, but if you are an horror fan or you liked the comics, you can see it with the risk of being disappointed at the end."

","If there was ever a reason to be scared during a movie, this is it. This film literally sucks the life-force out of the viewer. That's barely a euphemism, engaging in this film is the celluloid equivalent of having a century old beast suck the blood from a gaping hole in your jugular.<br/><br/>It's not a lack of style that brings this film down, in fact it's uber-styled, it's just a lack of everything else. The acting leaves something to be desired, the dialogue is about as relevant as democracy in Iraq and the plot holes are bigger than Sam Raimi's ego (that could be slightly exaggerated as Sam Raimi's ego has it's own gravitational pull).<br/><br/>The vampires definitely had a cool look, but their actions and dialogue were more of a plot device than anything else. Props must be given for the gore and violence, but it's nothing we haven't seen before.<br/><br/>The acting was mediocre at best, especially considering the cast. A little character development might have helped as I think Romero's zombie's might be angry that vampire's went and ate their bread and butter. <br/><br/>All in all I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, it's not quite stylish enough to shut off the sensors, and not B-grade enough for a good laugh. I guess if you're 13 years old and have a crush on Josh Hartnett this might be a film for you. Enjoy."

","'30 Days of Night' is a comic turned film; a throw back to the old horror films that were once the best in the business. The films revolves around a secluded town in Alaska, that for once a year is thrown into complete darkness for a month (hence the title). <br/><br/>The film begins with an unknown man trenching through the snow into this small town, instantly grabbing the audience's attention. As the film continues, the audience see how everyone in town is packing up and leaving, but of course the inevitable happens car breaks down/misses the flight/pure stubbornness, what ever the excuse; they're forced to stay for the whole month. But as darkness falls the vampires come to feast on those still there. And the carnage begins!<br/><br/>The great thing about '30 Days' is that it doesn't follow stereotypes, created by modern generic films. Gone are the sexy, stylish vampires and bring in the animalistic, evil, haunting ones. The gore factor is off the chart. The director gives the audience beheadings, killing of children and just vast amounts of massacre. <br/><br/>Specking of the director, David Slade, is without a doubt the films strongest point. His technical work is the flawless. His use of camera angles sets the tone and gives a real intensity to the film (namely the crane span across the town as the towns-folk run for their lives, and fail). But what surprised me the most was the lack of C.G.I or computer effects.<br/><br/>Nowadays every film use C.G.I in some way, and yes this film does use it, but in a completely different way than other horror/vampire films. The main effects are used on the surroundings to reinforce the idea about being completely isolated from the rest of the world. Even the vampires aren't 'C.G.Ied'. It's thanks to the makeup and costume department rather than the over the top special effects.<br/><br/>The acting, I feel, was average to good. Josh Harnett plays the male protagonist, a role which he's played many times before, and I can think of many others who can do a better job. He isn't bad; he just isn't different from any other character he's played. Melissa George is his bitter estranged wife, Stella. George tackles a new role and pulls it off! She takes control not only in fighting the vampires but as an actress too. The other acting is good too, but didn't live up to the rest of the film. <br/><br/>The main bad point was the ending, a little cliché, something that Slade had avoided the whole way through. But then again it is difficult to give it another ending which is as dramatic. <br/><br/>This film, without question, is the best since '28 Days Later', and just as original. The main idea about '30 Days', is that is does nothing new for the vampire genre, it just avoids cliché and reintroduces the elements of horror that audiences love. It is an understated film, shunning over the top and overly ambitious scenes. I recommend this film highly. It will have you scared but still getting you to peak up from behind the sofa."
"Good-Will","3","2","6","11 April 2008"," Just plain bad
","After reading the comments here, I was looking forward to a film which might reignite the sadly neglected genre.<br/><br/>Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was just bored throughout the whole tedious, derivative, cliché ridden mess that was 30 Days Of Night.<br/><br/>I mean, come on! Had these people never seen a horror film? Even in Alaska they have TV! Their reactions, responses and thought processes were like that of a four year old fearing something under the bed.<br/><br/>Cardboard cutout characters behaving like children is no basis for a thrill. I watched in stupefaction as they seemed to make the worst decisions possible (so I lost interest in their survival after a while), and whilst the gore factor was thankfully underplayed, I just couldn't help but side with the vampires. Just kill them and put them out of their misery, for heaven's sake! It ain't rocket science! You can smell them, apparently.<br/><br/>But no. We are privileged enough to have to put our brains on the back burner and accept plot holes that you could fly a Boeing 747 through, a whole host of miserably poor performances which would hardly pass as acting in a junior school drama class, and a denouement that made almost no sense at all. Erm, where did the rest of the vampires go when the sun came up? Just because it's based on a graphic novel (in my mind, this was more like a child's comic book) doesn't mean that it can't be a great film.<br/><br/>Hellboy was a blast. The X-Men films were amusing and amazing. The Batman films were variable, but generally dark and well plotted.<br/><br/>So as you can tell, I didn't like it, and would not recommend it to anyone over the age of 10, or a corresponding IQ.<br/><br/>Cheers, Will"
"zardoz-13","8","2","6","1 November 2007"," Different Kind of Vampires
","The novelty of director David Slade's vampire movie ""30 Days of Night"" is its unique Alaskan setting. The opening titles reveal that Barrow is the northernmost town in the United States, with some 80 miles of road less wilderness separating it from its nearest neighbors. Moreover, once a month every year during the winter, the sun doesn't shine on Barrow. Anybody that knows anything about vampires knows that they only come out at night to prey. Cleverly, ""30 Days of Night"" exploits this bit of vampire lore for maximum impact, and the clueless citizens of Barrow line up like a buffet for these atheist bloodsuckers. Scenarists Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie, and Brian Nelson drew their blood-curdling screenplay for this ghoulish, often gruesome, exercise in nihilism from the 2004 graphic IDW novel series by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith. Moviegoers who love their horror chillers basted in blood and gore will relish this taut tale of terror. Although the basic plot doesn't depart drastically from the standard vampire movie formula, the ""30 Days"" vampires differ from the Bela Lugosi/Christopher Lee variety. The ""30 Days"" vampires don't shape-shift into either wolves or bats. They dress in conventional clothes, bare jagged shark-like teeth rather than the dual canine fangs, and they feed on their victims like sharks rending flesh in a frenzy. Further, they defy gravity and bounce around like circus acrobats, and two of them boast enough strength to flip an SUV. They deploy their razor-sharp, talon-like fingernails to slash open gullets before they feast on the wounded. Finally, only the leader of these vampires can speak, and his accent is so thick and guttural that subtitles are necessary to translate his words.<br/><br/>As the last day of sunlight fades over Barrow, Alaska, North Slope Borough Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett of ""Sin City"") encounters 'strange' things. First, Eben and his deputy discover a pit of melted down cell phones. Second, they learn that vandals have destroyed a helicopter for no apparent reason. Third, a knife-wielding maniac has savagely slaughtered an entire kennel of sled-dogs. No, the dogs die off-screen, only the human die on screen. Meanwhile, Eben's estranged wife Stella (Melissa George of ""Turistas"") is scrambling to get out of Barrow before the airport shuts down. She works for the state fire marshal, and she's finishing up her inspection of the Barrow facility. While she is driving through the snow-swept landscape to the airport, a man steering a snow-plow collides with her when his brakes lock up. You'll chuckle at the folks who jump in their seats at this scene. Unhappily, Stella finds herself stranded in Barrow for 30 days with a man that she doesn't want to see.<br/><br/>Eben arrests an unkempt ruffian at the local diner, the Stranger (Ben Foster of ""3:10 to Yuma""), for threatening the cashier. Suddenly, the lights go dark, the phones go dead, and the Internet goes down. The creepy Stranger warns Eben that bad things are in store for Barrow. Everywhere, blurry figures erupt from the shadows. They pounce without warning on the unsuspecting. They haul their victims out of sight in seconds as if sharks had seized them and dragged them underwater. Eben and Stella gather a small group of people, and they hideAnne Frank stylein the attic of a boarded-up house while the vampires storm Barrow. Eventually, Eben learns the hard way about thetwo ways to slay these bloodsuckers. You can either lop their heads off with an axe or obliterate their noggins with a shotgun. Again, these vampires aren't the traditional variety. Similarly, ""30 Days"" doesn't qualify as a run-of-the-mill vampire movie.<br/><br/>Aside from one reference to Bela Lugosi, the ""30 Days"" characters know nothing about vampires. They never discuss the merits of wooden stakes over crosses or vials of holy water versus the use of garlic. Mirrors never play a part in any conversation. These animalistic vampires enter wherever they please without awaiting an invitation like the Bela Lugosi/Christopher Lee variety. These seemingly invincible fangsters follow their leader Marlow (Danny Huston of ""The Kingdom"") without question. The high point of ""30 Days""--or low point depending on your opinion--occurs when our heroes scavenge for food and medical supplies in a supermarket. A little girl (newcomer Abbey-May Wakefield) with a five o'clock shadow of dried blood on her jowls and a devilish glint in her black eyes lurks on the premises. She spots the small band of survivors. Like a suicidal, banzai-screaming Japanese soldier, she attacks them with her shark teeth bared, screaming for their blood.<br/><br/>""Hard Candy"" helmer David Slade takes his sinister subject matter pretty seriously. The R-rated violence is appropriately grim, sometimes even horrendous, with no shortage of blood spilled. The squeamish should avoid ""30 Days."" The performances are low-key, with Josh Harnett looking believably resilient for a change. Melissa George plays Stella with convincing grit. Slade shuns the use of comic relief to lighten things up when events turn truly nasty as the number of good guys dwindles during the 30 days of darkness. In many ways, Slade's horror opus resembles a B-western. The terrain is stark, rugged and inhospitable. The enigmatic night creatures invade Barrow, ostensibly from a ship anchored in the Arctic ice, and they behave like sadistic Apaches who want to annihilate everybody and destroy everything. In other words, they amount to memorable, menacing malefactors. The hero's strategy to defeat the fangsters is the last thing that you'd expect, but the showdown between Marlow and Eben looks straight out of a western. Although the story takes place in an Alaskan pipeline community, the filmmakers staged the mayhem on location in New Zealand. ""30 Days of Night"" ranks as an above-average, white-knuckled, full-fanged vampire epic that goes for the jugular."
"jaredmobarak","7","2","6","23 October 2007"," Where's my phone?30 Days of Night
","Here is the next chapter in the graphic novels cum film movement that has been taking over the industry. The ingredients seem pretty foolproof: a revisionist vampire tale screenwritten by the novel's authors, a setting without the sun for thirty days, a hard-r rating, a good cast, and visionary music video director David Slade fresh off his debut feature Hard Candy. 30 Days of Night is a brutal look into a world where the monsters reign supreme with little in their way to slow them down. With stunning cinematography, a beautiful washed out/dark cool color palette, realistic gore with unflinching detail, and a dark empty void of happiness, this one looked like a winner all the way. That is, until the ending. It is a shame that a story as hardcore as this one would take the path it does at the conclusion. Something a bit more tongue-in-cheek or satirical could have easily gotten away with it, but this one deserved to be allowed to run its course of brutality without a convenient finish putting a bittersweet smile on our faces before the lights turned back on, releasing us from the hold of Alaska's darkest moments.<br/><br/>I can't say anything bad about the directing. Slade has shown again that style can add a lot to a visionary tale such as this. He is given more room to move as opposed to the two leads, one venue he had for the brilliant Hard Candy, but still closed in enough to be able to create an aesthetic that didn't need to change. The entire film takes place in the town of Barrow, amongst the houses, stores, and streets with the everyone knows everyone cast of locals. The Stranger who treks into town cuts them off from civilization and keeps the director trapped inside as well to find inventive places to shoot. Complete with jerky, frame missing attack scenes, Slade does not disappoint when it comes to eye candy. Close-ups abound and his ability to keep the camera on the casualties while they are chalked up is a bold breath of fresh air. Very few moments are actual scary jolts. This film's true fear creator is in the unabashed view of all the carnage at work.<br/><br/>Staying on course, visually speaking, you have never seen vampires depicted quite like this. Their faces are distorted and smooth without blemishes. I have not read the books, so I don't know how much these creatures are manifestations of the artwork, but I couldn't help see the similarities to the beasties in videos by music group Aphex Twin. While the beings I'm thinking of were in the promos by Chris Cunningham, Slade too directed some of the band's work. Not only were the facial structures otherworldlyvery fallen angelbut the blank stares and open mouths they possessed showed a detached side to them as they were only out for blood. This is a dying race not attempting to expand their legions, but instead to just survive. I loved the one bald creature with blood on its face throughout the film. He was so memorable because the blood almost created a five-o'clock shadow on his face.<br/><br/>Credit all involved, and the actor himself, for getting Danny Huston into this film. He is amazing as the lead vampire Marlow. I thought the foreign language was a stroke of genius, but it is his mannerisms that really allow the part to succeed. The mouth breathing is foreboding and creepy, dried blood keeps adding upon his face, and his eyes are made up of a continuous blank stare. Someone as accomplished as he is in supporting roles should be commended for taking a role such as this and performing it seriously. This is no Bela Lugosi, as one character says, this is a malicious being out for survival amongst a race that he knows is inferior to his own.<br/><br/>As for the other actors, it is a pretty good job across the board. Josh Hartnett is surprisingly competent. I attribute that to the fact that he is mostly shown with a stoic, contemplative face. If there is one thing he does well, that is it. It's usually when he smiles and tries to be mister cool that he falters, but thankfully he never really gets that chance here. Ben Foster shows again that no one can do what he doesno one, and Melissa George shows she is an interesting actress whom I have not been able to see yet. Not quite sure if I liked her completely, but she didn't do anything to make me think I shouldn't have. Also, it's a pleasure to see Mark Boone Junior take on a role that lasts. Too many only have like five minutes of screen time (Batman Begins) and he is better than that.<br/><br/>Again, though, the ending just left me cold. Sure what happens as a result stays true to the event, it is just the event itself that made me cringe. Harnett's sheriff must make a decision before his whole town and all he cares about goes up in flames. Up until that point, the movie had been an edge of your seat thrill ride where it seemed that no one was too important to die. I was even starting to smile that I might be getting a fully tragic end devoid of survivors. Unfortunately, the sheriff makes a decision so out of left field that it elicited more chuckles than poignant tears as a more thought out sequence might have. It doesn't totally derail an otherwise solid genre flick, but it does leave just the right amount of bile in your throat to sully what comes before it with a faint bad taste."
"Sweet_and_Lowdown77","Null","4","17","17 October 2007"," Good, but flawed
","This is a well made film. It looks great. Sounds great. Good gore (if you are into that). Surprisingly good acting (especially from bad Vampire #1). But, and this might not mean a lot to a lot of people, but... the story is very weak.<br/><br/>1) Once you get past the gimmick, there isn't much. Okay Vampires can only come out at night and night lasts 30 days. So they don't have to hide every 12 hours. That premise gets old fast. 2) The Vampires were portrayed as very clever. They manipulate a human to help them find the town, sabotage the communication system and kill all the dogs in town. But yet... The Vampires are in a town with only a handful of people and 20 buildings and they cannot find 10 people hiding in an attic - for 30 days? There is a mass exodus from town in the opening scene. So only a handful of the 152 citizens remain. The vamps kill at least 15 right away. Then for 15 more days can't find the remaining people? 3) The humans go without food water or the bathroom for 30 days 4) Why turn yourself into a Vampire 15 minutes before the sunrises? 5) There's no real plot. Just survive the 30 days. 6) If you cast Melissa George in a film and never have her out of a snowsuit you should be fired. At least have the obligatory, ""i have to shower"" scene. Come on!<br/><br/>Like I said, these are plot/script problems that might not be a problem for some. I think the screenwriters (and by default the director) let the audience down. The production was big. The acting good. The VFX and FX were great.<br/><br/>If they put a little attention into some story issues this could have been great. that and a little skin from Melissa George. Is that too much to ask?"

","Holded off in an Alaskan town the few remaining left during a month of eternal darkness finds the town under a constant attack from vampires looking to feed and must fend them off in order to save themselves.<br/><br/>This one was quite an enjoyable and fun vampire effort. Among the better qualities here is the long build-up to the vampires arriving, which is nicely handled through a slew of chilling scenes. The first attacks on the dog kennel and the houses on the outskirts of town, complete with the couple who are dragged under the houses, as well as worker attacks and the eerie howling in the distance are shoehorned nicely around the action of how they're slowly being overtaken all manage to come together in a setting up a fine based for the bigger, better action scenes here. The best of these is the spectacular assault on the town where they relentlessly overwhelm the townspeople jumping around, ripping up bodies and generally destroying the town rather fun, which is made all the more fun by the overhead viewpoint showing the streets and snowbanks littered with blood and feeding on the bodies around here. There's also quite a few other attacks in here, from a thrilling encounter on the streets where they overrun a car, the attacks of the station and all the fun of the later half which features the ambush in the general store, the encounter in the house and another big escape attempt through the streets using a giant machine-tractor tearing through their ranks in breaking up the bodies that makes for a great time here. As well, the finale here makes for some really enjoyable times with the final battling in the building, the big rescue attempt to get the friends' free and then the over-the-top final battle amid the burning town with some nice visual action, a brutal brawl and a fine finale which makes for a great finish on a high note. Along with the film's gore and impressive overall look for the vampires, these manage to hold this one up compared to the few minor flaws here. The biggest issue here is the film's inability to get the characters on the same page here in regards to what they're facing which leads them through a long stretch of time being defensive when it easily could've been going on the offensive to ward them off. The inability to grasp this concept makes for a lot of their actions suspect in terms of keeping their chances of staying alive down. Finally, the vampires themselves aren't all that scary. These here are the film's flaws.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."

To elaborate on that ,in modern-day vampires have lost their horror status, twilight and vampire dairies are to blame here no doubt that, and unlike them here vampires are depicted us hunters and humans are shows as more or less helpless against them. This is my reason why that movie is so good , because hits on the primal fear of the beasts that roam the world and when we try to fight back, we are powerless against them and what we know due to that, becomes useless, in short the summary of lovecraftian horror.

","David Slade directs a grisly vampire tale about the town of Barrow, Alaska being under siege by a group of vampires. Slade holds nothing back when showing the carnage of vampires feasting on townspeople and the writers weren't shy about writing who dies either. Inspired by a graphic novel, 30 Days of Night has appeared to turn the vampire genre into a darker more sinister approach. The film is great in the fact that it has times of suspenseful tense dialogue and moments of complete chaos. The Russian vampires are greatly barbaric and having a strong frightening screen presence. The cold blistery atmosphere was a great setting and created the sense of complete hopelessness being stranded. Characters and acting seemed to be more on the weaker side, nothing terrible, but they rode the line of mediocrity. From that one negative setback 30 Days of Night is still one of the better movies of the late 2000's and a good purchase for any gore/horror fanatic."

There is enough strange goings on in the plot to make you wonder ""what's going to happen next"". The star characters are also not deep, but they are relivable enough to grow a certain 'home town' affection. Just normal folks living their lives in a little out-of-the-way (okay, way out of the way) town where they do their thing. Then along comes terror in the worst possible way. It is spooky, creepy, and probably one of the most bloody movies, vampire or not, I've ever seen. There's plenty of blood, nasty flesh-tearing, and some of the most gruesome deaths this side of 'Wrong Way II' (remember the meat grinder??) The vampires are very creepy and evil looking. The movie-makers adjusted them just enough to give them a new, more violent and fearsome look. I loved it.

"seanman5000","9","1","2","4 July 2011"," Never Seen a Vampire Film Like This Before....And That is a Good Thing!
","The first vampire films that I ever saw were films like ""The Lost Boys,"" or ""Fright Night."" Then, I ran into this one, and I am glad that I did! 30 Days of Night is basically about a town in Alaska called Barrow (FYI this town actually exists), that experiences a period of darkness for 30 days, which is the perfect setup for blood thirsty vampires to come in! The plot of this film couldn't be simpler, and that's okay. It is basically a cat and mouse game all the way through, and I like horror movies that do that! It makes it more intense that way. First off, Ben Foster as The Stranger is a very chilling performance. I didn't even realize that was him until very recently. He did a great job! Josh Hartnett and Melissa George played their characters well, too. They were great leaders throughout the film, and you need a leader in a horrifying cat and mouse game. Second, the vampires in this film were unlike any I have ever scene because they spoke their own language, which was creepy, especially when they talked to the townspeople. I think it is scary when a creature is yelling something at you, and you don't even know what they are saying. The leader vampire was the creepiest in my opinion because he spoke the language. Most of the vampires did not even say anything, but they still made great characters. They were creatures, and that is what I liked. I also admired the uneasiness about how to kill the vampires, and that they used ultraviolet light to kill one of them. One terrifying scene that I still have a hard time to watch is when the vampires use a girl as bait to lure out anyone who is hiding in town, and when there is nobody left, they slowly torture and eat her. This scene just showed me that the vampires run the town now, and they can do whatever they want, when they want. They were like a gang with fangs! Overall, this film was a fantastic scare flick. The ending was too bittersweet for me, but the majority has great scares, great action, and of course great vampires. I strongly recommend this one, especially when you are looking for something to watch in the dark!"
"RockPortReview","9","1","2","3 July 2011"," This is an awesome adaptation of the graphic novel!
","In recent years there have been tons of comic books and graphic novels adapted into movies with varying success. For the most part they are a goldmine that Hollywood will continue to tap way past their usefulness. 30 Days of Night is a graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith that gives an interesting new spin to the overly used vampire genre. Taking place in Barrow Alaska, one of the most northern cities in the world, every winter the sun doesn't rise above the horizon for 30 days. A perfect place for a clan of blood thirsty vampires to set up camp.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night was released in the fall of 2007 and directed by David Slade, who also directed one of the Twilight movies and the brilliant Hard Candy that I previously reviewed on this blog. 30 Days stars Minnesota's own Josh Hartnett as Eben the town's young sheriff who works to keep the peace in very cold and depressing atmosphere. Melissa George is cast as Stella the best looking fire marshal in film history. When you think fire marshal you think of a big old burly guy with a beard, a grizzled veteran with decades of real world experience and not a blonde haired supermodel. Anyway I guess she is whole lot better to look at, and she also doubles as Eben's estranged wife. As Barrow starts shutting down for the 30 days a bunch of strange things start happening. A team of sled dogs is murdered and the internet and phones stop working. Coincidence, I think not. The leader of the Vampires is played by Danny Houston who really gives life to his undead character of Marlow. The Vampires talk in a foreign language that was created specifically for this film. Although a number of questions do remain like where did they come from? Where do they go for the other 11 months of the year? These questions might be answered in the graphic novels, but I have yet to read any of them.<br/><br/>After a bloody feeding frenzy wipes out most of the towns remaining people, Eben and Stella help protect a small group of survivors. This truly is an R rated horror film and not one of those kid friendly PG-13 flicks. The blood and gore is top notch and flows freely to satisfy your most hardcore fan. I have two wonderful words for you ""Neck Chop"" and there are a few of them. The acting is actually pretty good and the pacing is perfect. The ending is kind of a head scratcher, but with the poor quality of horror movies being released these days I'm willing to let it go. Last year a direct to DVD sequel was released called 30 Days of Night: Dark Days featuring all new characters and a recast version of Stella. It's a cheap and pointless piece of trash. Enough said. Although the original movie is definitely worth a buy!"

","The reviews thus far are long ones, so I will keep it short. I have been quite ""off"" when there's vampires afoot in films nowadays (I'm more into the vampires like V.Price, J.Palance and such characterizations) so this movie didn't had much going for it. But the look, effects and the fact that it did not pushed some nervous funniness into it caught my attention. And when either animals or children is spared by the hunting pack of these predators it makes it more eerie and believable. Good suggestive parts in the electro acoustic soundtrack.<br/><br/>Maybe not a masterpiece of the genre but a well needed injection (in times of the Twilight movies and other atrocities.)"

","This movie was a pretty good surprise for me. It had some of the flaws you expect in a horror/action film, but it also had more strong points than I expected. It was well shot, well scored, and well acted (for such a film). The dialogue wasn't always great, but it was better than average.<br/><br/>I enjoyed seeing the vampires howl and mutilate (which is much better than sparkling) These vamps were dangerous and slightly unpredictable. It's rare to feel any suspense in horror these days, but this film gave me plenty of that.<br/><br/>In the end, it's still a B movie at heart. It's just a B movie with a lot of talent behind it."
"kluseba","7","1","2","24 October 2010"," Intense and frosty survival horror
","This movie is a very interesting vampire movie settled in a cold town in Alaska where strange people live, a little bit like ""The barber"".<br/><br/>The only thing that I found bad about this movie is that it was too fast obvious that vampires had infiltrated the city. It would have been more interesting to let the viewers in the doubt of what happened, as it could have also been a serial killer or a criminal organization that committed the first crimes. As you now quite fast that vampires have organized that, there is a lack of tension after the very interesting and dark beginning of the movie. I must also admit that this movie basically doesn't add something new to the genre. Those two minor factors are the reasons why I cut some points off the rating.<br/><br/>But at least, this movie turns then quite fast into an entertaining and intense survival story where everybody desperately tries to save his soul and reflect about his life. There are many intense scenes like the old and isolated guy who gives his life to save his comrades, the guy who got bitten by a child vampire and asks the other ones to kill him or the main actor who tries desperately to save his ex-girlfriend to prove her that he still loves her and wants her back. Another good point is the dramatical and uneasy ending of the movie that is as dark as the whole film's atmosphere. There is a lot of tension in this movie and you really begin to like the desperate and morbid atmosphere in the lost village and can somehow identify with all of this.<br/><br/>To sum it up, this movie is an intense and atmospheric vampire movie and survival horror with credible actors and some shocking scenes. This movie might please to anyone who likes the horror genre and is the best horror movie of the year 2007 in my opinion."

The camera pans back from a side on shot and swoops up above the towns street level to show multiple patches of blood spray all over the snow.

"nate878","7","1","2","1 November 2009"," Finally vampires with bite! but with little else
","30 Days of Night serves as a pivotal rebirth of the vampire-movie franchise with the premise of archaic, zombie-like, piranha toothed vampires that resurface fear in a genre that hasn't scared since Nosferatu. Despite this though, poor exposition and plot progression had minimized what could have been a fully revitalized fear of vampires. <br/><br/>While the film certainly does an excellent job of setting the scene in the otherwise small and isolated town of Barrow, Alaska, locked away in 30 days of night, your more or less presented with a quick blitzkrieg of violence that numbs any perfectly planned tension and suspense that could have otherwise been capitalized. <br/><br/>And yes, there is quite the amount of, at times disturbing, violence. This is reflected in the fact that these vampires, while committing horrible atrocities themselves, aren't taken down with splinters of wood and crucifixes, but with extreme force (i.e axes, shot-guns and even earth-moving vehicles). <br/><br/>Acting is well done for the most part, especially in the case of Ben Foster's take on a mentally-ill vagrant. Otherwise, Josh Hartnett did an otherwise sufficient role as sheriff, but ultimately didn't serve as a very compelling character. <br/><br/>In the end the film implemented the right elements but rushed them on the audience without good use of tension, leading you to be more rattled then actually scared. Perhaps as well, this story was better used as a mini series given the original comic-book it was based on. Somehow covering 30 days over a near-two hour film just didn't pace well."

","A modern horror tale, this time focusing on vampire myths, sees a pack of ruthless vampiric fiends attack a remote Alaskan town on the first night of a sunset that will last for thirty days. And that's about it really. Their motives are never made clear, nor where they came from or where they will go next. They just swoop in to feed, after first cutting off the town from all outside help - phone lines, transport, mobile phones and even the sleigh dogs are killed as night falls. A small band of people survive the initial onslaught - beautifully captured by method of an over-head camera shot, following the carnage through the main street of the town - and must try to sit it out until daybreak, a whole month in the future. Whilst hardly inspired in the plot line, griping about that would be missing the point entirely. We aren't told where they come from because it's not important. We aren't told why this town was chosen for the same reason. They are monsters, plain and simple, and damn effective ones at that. Bloody, violent and intense, this is a quality modern horror flick."

","1st watched 1/15/2009, (Dir-David Slade): Disturbing and scary vampire/zombie-like scarefest about a foreign speaking group of bloody folks who overtake a town in Alaska during the 30 days of night experienced by this area during every winter. The small group left to fight or hide(really) from the predators all know each other, of course, because they live in a very small town. The sheriff, played by Josh Hartnett, is also the leader and makes the decisions necessary to survive. This type of movie definitely has been done before and in some ways it resembles ""Night of the Living Dead"" movies, except the vampire/zombies are more disgusting and speak(although it's in a foreign tongue  from what country we don't know). It's also similar to this movie in that the survivors realize that waiting things out is better than blasting the ghouls with a bunch of firepower. If they wait 30 days then the sun will come and burn them up and they're used to the winters around there so it shouldn't be that difficult, right?? Well it's not that easy and, of course, we get many opportunities to see the creatures suck the blood and devour their next victim. I guess the reason I liked this movie is because it does what it intended to do,, scare you!! The creatures aren't that smart --- for some reason they don't check the attics where the people are hiding out and they aren't that unique when it comes to movie creatures but they are scary. This one factor is really what measures these type of movies, so if you can handle the blood and gore, enjoy it!!"

The ending is dark and done well without being over-played.<br/><br/>The main problem I had with this is that the sense of time isn't kept, the people are supposed to be there for 30 days but don't need to shave or get cabin fever, it might as well have been 1 day of night for all the difference that the 30 days made to the story. There is also the one stupid bit where a building with bright lights, outside and in, and its own power is ignored when so much effort is made to dismantle everything else.<br/><br/>Still those minor problems aside it is a nice horror that's easy to sit back and watch."
"pc95","5","1","2","6 October 2008"," Overall Lacks Intelligence
","While not a complete dud, 30 days of Night leaves a lot to be desired. It's mostly run of mill and cliché, and contradicts itself in a couple of places. (spoilers!) For instance initially the vampires seem to have super-human speed and reaction, but later in the movie they move at normal motions - likewise with strength. There's quite a lack of explanations, and too bad intriguing exposition with the vampires dialog is kept under wraps. The finale scene although a bit over-the-top does pretty well to somewhat salvage clichéd suspense horror situations and a bad abuse and overuse of gore which hurts the film. Likewise the romance is rehashed and recycled. And there's a completely tasteless scene with a child-vampire. The makeup is done very well though. This is no John Carpentar's The Thing, but it has a few good scenes going for it and technical competency."

I'd rather watch the credits of any those films. And, the first person to mention The Lost Boys loses an eye. As for TDoN, Josh Hartnett and company hide in the dark for a long time, some die, and it ends. Mercifully. Having said that, I have little doubt that the comic is, if fact, awesome. There is an appearance by the ever popular person who gets someone killed, played by an old man with Alzheimer's, Ben Foster as The Lonely One confederate, and...the pudgy guy from The Constant Gardener as the leader?

"MetalGeek","6","1","2","2 June 2008"," Has its moments, but still a disappointment
","30 DAYS OF NIGHT came highly recommended to me by some friends whose opinions I respect, so when I brought the DVD home from the video store I was excited to see what the box cover promised was ""one of the best horror films of the decade,"" or words to that effect. Unfortunately I eventually found myself disappointed by 30 DAYS OF NIGHT. I will say that I love the concept - a horde of vampires descending on a snowbound, remote Alaskan town just as the sun sets for a month - and the first half hour or so of set-up was excellent (as the unseen vampires methodically destroy every possible escape route for the puny humans still in town). The vampires were also totally bad-ass, which was a pleasant surprise (too many vamp films these days try to go the Anne Rice route and make them sympathetic, romantic, misunderstood creatures -- screw that, I want my vampires to be savage killing machines!!) But once the vampires attack and the real Monster Mash begins, the film fell apart very quickly for me. It's fun while the bloodsuckers are running around causing chaos, but there are far too many scenes where the surviving humans, after escaping to a new hidey-hole, have conversations like ""NOW where do we go?"" that kill any momentum that has been built up. The film doesn't skimp on gore, though, so it gets pretty major points for that; but overall 30 DAYS OF NIGHT seemed cobbled together from a bunch of spare parts. If the pacing had been tightened up a little in the editing room we might have had a classic on our hands; as it is, 30 DAYS is worth a look but not a must see. A shame."
"BaronBl00d","6","1","2","1 June 2008"," Don't Give It the Cold Shoulder
","Okay, yes, this is a seemingly big-budgeted horror film(this distinction makes it greatly differ from another big-budgeted film)with loads of blood, guts, unsavory acts of violence toward women and children, and an incomprehensible script if one is looking for any dose of realism at all. Look but in vain for ye shall not find it. What we do know is that Barrow, Alaska, a town in the northernmost part of North America, has a period of one month where it is blanketed in total darkness - 30 days of darkness with no sunlight(just in case the concept was too complex I explained it at its most fundamental level here - kidding of course!). For some unexplained and not-so-inexplicable reason, a horde of foreign-sounding vampires descend on the town as soon as the first day of darkness ensues. What we get then is a period of non-stop hunting - vampires are the hunters and a rag-tag group of Alaskans who chose not to go somewhere else for this period become the prey. We get your usual suspects here. The town sheriff and the girl he broke up with thrust together under bad circumstances. Josh Hartnett and Melissa George play the couple with some conviction. But let's make no mistake, this is not a character driven piece by any standard. We get the crazed loner who rides a bulldozer and several other weird townsfolk we have seen prototypes of for years in film. The vampires look less than impressive and speak some alien language, and the film is decidedly grim with regard to violence and how it is shown. Though I would not recommend this film to the casual horror enthusiast for that specific reason, I did enjoy the film - flaws and all - for its fast-paced action and use of setting as a means of creating mood, theme, and plot in such a refreshing way. The story is wildly inconsistent and the acting mediocre at best, but director David Slade has just enough juice in other ways to make the film work for me in many ways. This is not a real good film nor is it a good film like more mainstream horror pictures you might see - but it is a reminder of the trend of horror today of being graphic, cold, dispassionate, and dehumanizing. It also shows how action and horror - like in Aliens for example - can be fused and work on some level."

","This is one of the worst films I've ever watched.

Only gore-fest fans who don't care about anything else will find this film enjoyable.<br/><br/>The lead vampire does nothing except screech and glare, but I'd rate him as the best actor in the film. At least he shows a much better range than the wooden performances of the leading man and woman. Unfortunately the vampires, despite their superhuman powers, are made into bumbling idiots by the plot. 30 days of night and they can't even search a small town? I thought vampires were only supposed to sleep in the day time, so what was this bunch doing the whole time?<br/><br/>I could go on for a long time, but don't want to include anything that might be considered a spoiler. Though the word ""spoiler"" is not something that could meaningfully be applied to this piece of trash."
"michaeljharvey","6","1","2","3 May 2008"," A tense, interesting take on the vampire genre
","As many have pointed out, this is not a perfect film. Overall I liked it quite a bit, but I'll start with the major plot flaw that bothered me throughout. The vampires initially seem intent on ransacking the town and killing everyone in sight as fast as possible. However, after they've taken out 95% of the town, they just kind of hang around for another 20 days. There's not much left to do or to feed on; it made no sense. They don't seem to be actively hunting for the final survivors. In fact, they don't seem to be doing much at all. A brief speech from the head vampire indicates they want to destroy any possible witnesses to what has happened, but they aren't all that motivated to find the last group of survivors hiding in the attic. It's not a very big town. I would think it would take the vampires only a few hours to search the entire thing thoroughly.<br/><br/>If you get by the major plot problem, the film is actually a pretty tense affair. It feels part horror movie, part survivor story. The vampires are portrayed in a gritty, realistic fashion. There's no romantic vision of the vampire here. The vampires are little more than a wolf pack of predators. While they have super-human strength and quickness, they don't seem to be extraordinarily intelligent. If anything, they are more like animals. The setting in Alaska is original and helps the feeling of desperation. There truly is no escape from these creatures in the snowy isolation. It reminded me of the claustrophobic feel of Alien, where the central characters are picked off one-by-one with nowhere to run.<br/><br/>The main characters are developed just enough that we have something to care about, but for the most part their personal stories are pushed to the background as they are in a desperate fight for their lives. I also enjoyed the lack of background on the vampires. Leaving their history unknown was a nice touch. The mysterious and unexplained is always more frightening.<br/><br/>As for the ending, I will agree with others who have said it was cheesy. It was one of the few bad moments in an otherwise well done, realistic/gritty movie. It didn't ruin it for me, but I would have hoped for something more dark and cynical. The action-movie style ""showdown"" fistfight didn't really work. Overall though, it was surprisingly good with very few poorly done moments that pulled the viewer out of the story. I would definitely recommend this to horror movie fans in the mood for a tense, gruesome vampire flick."

Only Sheriff Eben Oleson (Black Hawk Down's Josh Hartnett) and his wife Stella (Melissa George) stand between the survivors and certain destruction. These vampires can only be killed by beheading them, or shining very bright light in their face, there's no sign of crosses, garlic or holy water here.

"atliel","6","1","2","15 April 2008"," Better than most horror nowadays
","I really want to say that this movie was one of the best horror films I've seen in years, that it was a great addition to the Vampire horror sub-genre (a genre in need of a boost) and was worth owning in one's collection. And technically, considering the massive amount of crap Hollywood throws at us including bad Japanese Horror re-makes, ""original"" horror films borrowing Japanese style clichés and an abundance of slasher/torture porn I would be right in making that claim. However, on its own, its flaws keep it from being the classic it should have been.<br/><br/>The concept is great, a town in Alaska is raided by Vampires taking advantage of its Winter Solstice which causes the area to be shrouded in complete darkness for 30 days. What a great setting, reminiscent of the isolation in John Carpenter's film ""The Thing"" we are introduced to a small working class town where everyone knows each other and not much in the way of crime happens. So it is fitting that our protagonist is a law-man, Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnet), who is used to dealing with one empty jail cell and assisted at home base by his grandmother and younger brother.<br/><br/>Although the concept is great it unfortunately isn't fully realized on the big screen (I have not yet read the comic book). The feeling of isolation by being trapped in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by snow and ice is dealt with rather quickly. The cell phones that were burnt, the killing of a pack of dogs, the blackout were nice touches but were rushed. Was everyones communication to the outside world really destroyed? And the Stranger in town was really able to kill all those dogs? And no one heard a thing? And what took those vampires so long to figure out that killing the towns people during the winter solstice was a good idea? Where were they hiding out all this time? Note that I didn't hate the film either, I may be a bit nit picky but I'm also realistic. The performances and most of the scenes were well done. The battle between the sheriff and the lead vampire seemed to end too quickly but the ending itself was satisfying.<br/><br/>I just wish there was more emphasis on the isolation which may have led to better development of the characters (I just didn't feel anything for the victims). But considering the attempt at something more thought provoking and original than the current crop of horror I would still recommend this film."

Obviously he had to kill the leader of the vampires, but it wasn't a big or special fight at all... I just got the feeling, they could have distracted them somehow else, since the dawn was so close.

","30 Days of Night is a standard vampires-attacking-a-remote-town movie with the gimmick of the far-northern Alaskan setting that provides the condition of the title. See, because vampires can't exist in direct sunlight - bet you didn't know that - so thirty consecutive days without sunlight would be like heaven to them. But that's about it as far as originality for this by-the-numbers gorefest, although the thick arched eyebrows of Josh Hartnett provide some measure of entertainment.<br/><br/>Barrow, Alaska is the northernmost point in the United States, and as previously noted in Insomnia, that area of the world is plunged into darkness for an entire month of every year. This is useful for the purposes of the story here, because it provides an deadline for the denouement - the vampires have to be out of there before the sun rises again. So our intrepid hero and his motley gang of scruffy, bundled-up citizens have a full month to deal with their vampire infestation.<br/><br/>Sheriff Eben Oleson (Hartnett) is the small-town Johnny Law whom everyone knows and likes, although he keeps his feelings close inside, as most squinty-eyed, jut-jawed heroes do. On the last day of actual sunlight, he's busy making sure everyone's doing okay and is prepared for the coming darkness. Then he runs into a weird man known only as The Stranger (Ben Foster) who obliquely warns everyone that ""they"" are coming that evening, when night falls. Who are they? Superstrong vampires, that's who, and don't think they'll stop until they consume every last drop of your blood, or turn you into one of them. (The last part didn't make a lot of sense to me - why create someone who'll just be competition for food?) No hero is complete without some love interest, so we get Stella (Melissa George), Eben's ex-wife. They're attempting a separation, but naturally Stella - through hopelessly contrived events - is unable to depart the town before the last plane leaves. (How come no flights can arrive or depart the airport when it's dark out? The town has electricity. Maybe they can, but the plot wouldn't permit it.) So she and Eben are stuck together, arguing over who gets to save the town. Seriously. On more than one occasion, Stella says, ""I'm coming with you!"" - no way she's gonna let him do it alone! - and most of the time Eben overrules her, but not always, because he's a Thoughtful Hero as well.<br/><br/>And to underscore Eben's emotional ties to the community, we're also introduced to his kid brother Jake, who looks to be young enough to be Eben's son. True to the genre, Jake desperately seeks the approval of his successful (to a point) older brother, and he tries to save the town as well. But no, he's not old enough, and Eben is responsible for him, and darned if some kid's gonna be the hero instead of him! So there's that.<br/><br/>The movie leans rather heavily on its setting to move the plot along; the special effects are rather ho-hum, and the acting is weak. And it's not that Hartnett can't act - he's actually developing into quite the fine thesp - but here he's just sort of drifting along like a windblown snowpile. George is cute and perky and occasionally serious, but she too isn't quite up to the task. And that's perfectly okay if your leading man is charismatic or if the special effects wow the audience so much that they don't notice the wooden performances, but here that's not the case. You wind up turning your eyes to the gore that you'd expect to see in a vampire movie, but the gore isn't even especially interesting or vicious. Some scenes are disturbing, though; turns out the only way to kill a vampire is by beheading it, as guns apparently have little effect on them. Which doesn't stop at least one suicidal maniac from shotgunning several bloodsuckers in order to give his fellow humans some cover.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Good, interesting concept, dreary execution. The movie's based on a series of graphic novels, and my assumption is that the novels themselves had more character and pizazz on the page than this movie does on the screen."
"sunznc","6","1","2","10 March 2008"," 30 Days of Hiding
","I was all geared up to see this film. Actually, the idea is very intriguing. A small town in Alaska experiences 30 Days of darkness and many people leave the town during this time because they can't handle it. However, some stay by choice-a couple get stranded. Why can't they drive out though? Oh, one gets into an accident and she missed her plane and the others? Well, if you want this to make sense then this movie isn't going to work. And that is the truth. Once darkness comes all the cell phones remaining have been burned in a neat little pile in a snow covered field. And vampires descend upon the town via ship. An old ship out in the water. The remaining people in the town are left to fight off the vampires. But the vampires of course are faster and stronger and so the humans aren't doing too well. The small group of survivors decide they have to hide out and do so briefly in an attic and then later in an office with........windows! We're supposed to believe that they hid out for almost 30 days in an office with windows? Yes. They sort of move around the town for some reason. It isn't explained. I really want to like this film. I suppose some of the action scenes were pretty good. I think there were some creepy scenes. The vampires have a little help from CGI and they appear very strange at times. With oddly distorted faces and black eyes. But not much originality here. You have to accept the stupid writing and accept a banal story for it to work. Not bad but not great either. I think 28 Days Later was much better."
"Holmzb124","8","1","2","3 March 2008"," '30 Days of Night' cuts it's own niche
","I completely agree with Czarnobog. '30 Days of Night' is one very dark and eerily atmospheric vampire movie that doesn't follow the usual vampire movie clichés. The premise itself to lay siege to a town with no sun for 30 days is nice change of pace, but these vampires, led by Harlow (similar name to Barlow of 'Salem's Lot') are much more advanced than your typical vampires as far as their game plan to shut down the town and how they stalked their victims before killing them. Some decent spots of bloodshed, but nothing over the top or excessive. Well worth multiple watches and a great addition to your existing vampire movie collection."

","What does this movie have that others don't ? Abolutely nothing, you have seen it all. <br/><br/>Character development is really poor, you know nothing about the people living in the town, but that's usual in this kind of movie. <br/><br/>The story goes like usual people hides, vampires hunt them. <br/><br/>Cliché is all over the movie, from the start I would say the director wanted to copy that fargo thing with the snow and the sheriff. The vampires are dressed like they came from last night party, always covered in blood which doesn't seem to freeze. <br/><br/>The flare explosion not that good, it should have been plain dynamite. <br/><br/>The cheesy ending scene is just to much, you want to trow tomatoes at the screen. <br/><br/>These only scene worth the money, when some guy gets it's head chop off, really nice."
"Rob_Taylor","6","1","2","9 January 2008"," 90 Minutes of wtf?......
","Ho-hum. Given the basic storyline I was hoping for much more from this movie. Sadly it was not to be. Instead, we get pretty much every horror and vampire cliché you might care to think of. By themselves, clichés aren't terrible, but the rest of the movie is so annoying and painful to watch at times that the sum (of its bad parts) outweighs the whole quite completely.<br/><br/>Of particular annoyance was the lack of anything remotely looking like intelligence on the part of either the vampires or their victims. People do stupid things solely so they can be killed in an ""entertaining"" way by one vampire or another.<br/><br/>And as for the vampires.... Comical is the best way to describe them. They have all the menace of Halloween trick-or-treaters and the dress-sense of an eighties techno-rock band. Add in their kill-kill-kill-we-can't-do-anything-but-kill mentality and they are just the worst kind of farcical parody on the vampire legend that there could be. Plus the apparent lack of being able to do something as simple as wiping the blood from their faces (even after its supposedly been there for the whole month) just turns them into a big joke.<br/><br/>Picture this: You're the leader of a gang of vampires (about thirty or so I reckon) and you've plotted to sail up in the good ship SS Fangster just as a town goes into a sunless period for a month. So....you've got thirty days to desport yourself among the cattle that are the 150 human occupants. So what do you do? You effectively cut off all communications with the outside world.....check! Then you go into the town with your mob and slaughter 95% of the inhabitants on the first night......wait, what? This is what you are dealing with. There is no common sense here. The vampires act idiotically. And after killing most of the inhabitants, and knowing that there are others hiding, what do they do? Instigate a house to house search? Check every conceivable hideaway? No....they simply do very little until one of the humans does something almost as idiotic and draws attention to itself. Then they all rush to the attack mob-handed with their still bloody faces. Christ, even animals clean themselves.<br/><br/>In short, the plot is pretty dumb. There is also no suspense as a result and little in the way of character development.<br/><br/>The film editing also leaves MUCH to be desired. Scenes shift with such alarming rapidity that a bathroom break can (quite literally) mean missing a whole week's worth of the 30 days of the title.<br/><br/>Also, having cut the power to the town, one might imagine more being made of the fact that it's a tad chilly outside. I saw frosty breath (real or CGI'd) only once near the start of the film. And what do the characters do for heat whilst hiding away in the now unheated buildings? All of these things combine to ruin what could have been a good movie. On the plus side, Josh Hartnett's character dies at the end in quite a noble way (if a bit ridiculous) and there was a nice scene with a vampire child going nuts.<br/><br/>Other than that, the movie is an assault on the intellect that really adds nothing to the vampire genre that hasn't already been done, and better, by many other movies. Only the setting distinguishes this film from any other vampire movie and that was woefully underused.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Plot: Fair. Acting: OK. Stupidity: Off the scale CONCLUSION: If you want to see a horror/monster movie in a frozen setting buy the Thing on DVD."
"dbborroughs","6","1","2","5 January 2008"," I wanted to love this instead of like it
","As the 30 days of night sets in the town finds itself under siege by a group of vampires. Filled with haunting images this film was mixed bag for me. To be certain the build up to the siege is very good. There is something about the way the story is told that keeps you watching even though its not the most logical of story lines. The problem for me is that once things really get set in motion there are lapses in logic that distract from often fun proceedings. Granted I was watching this very late at night so there is a chance that I missed something, but I never quite understood why the vampires-if they were so clever to get to Barrow because of the night would have waded into the population with such a blood lust that would have left them with no one to eat two days after they started. There are a few other WTF moments that keep the film from being great, but over all its worth a shot on cable on a Saturday night if nothing else."
"orthodoxhedonist","7","1","2","5 January 2008"," Best Vampire Movie Since Near Dark
","There are titles in this genre that generally seem to miss the mark. Contrived efforts either made too ""stylish"" and unnecessarily complicated, or too ""over the top"" and laughably unbelievable. The few exceptions that managed to stand the test of time (for me anyways), shared an element of tangibility. Meaning at some point I actually bought that this could be happening while watching it. This was one of those movies, and quite frankly, the first vampire movie to have done so for me since possibly Near Dark.<br/><br/>People will name drop several entertaining (if not campy or facetious) romps through the bloodsucker genus to splatter film archives for the latter half of the 20th century - Salem's Lot, From Dusk Till Dawn, Fright Night, Lost Boys, Vampire Hunter D, Interview With The Vampire, Vampires, and the always popular Underworld and Blade trilogies etc, but outside of Nosferatu, Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), and the above mentioned Near Dark, there has been little in the way of anything genuinely frightening about them. 30 Days of Night manages to bring back some of the very raw and chilling elements of a good vampire story.<br/><br/>The cast, while never very devoted to the development of any characters, also isn't ""selling"" the cliché archetypes you've come to expect from the recent spate of ""high school horror"" monster/psycho affairs. The acting is surprisingly good by the leads, and to some extent the support (no doubt credit is due to Slade for careful directing here). The first clue this was something to pay attention to was not only the shot selection, but also that the actors themselves aren't caked with make up. Slade wants you to see these people as real, a believable setting you can relate to. The storyline, conceptually, may be the weakest link here. Group of survivors in a town under siege needs to ban together to stay alive, and improvise survival strategies as they go etc etc. Not exactly a high calorie plot for the fiction novel devotee, but rest assured you're never quite sure who makes it. The setting is really the sell point here. Snowed in and locked away with no chance for help in an Alaskan town that sees no daylight for 30 days, it really conveys well, and almost reminds of scenes from John Carpenters remake of The Thing.<br/><br/>The ""brood"", or family of vampires really is one of the defining qualities of this movie. There is something so cold, but so unforced about them. There is no Anne Rice script here, no lonely or lost soul you feel compassion for. They've been reduced down to the vampire essence, at the top of the carnivore food chain, speaking an ancient dialect among one another about how to best conduct war on man, to achieve their end to ultimately feed. One aspect I'd like to see become trend is you never feel like the effects get in the way. In perhaps the best use of GGI I've seen in some time, the effects are literally seamless. These almost reptilian hunters use their ability to stalk and hunt the weaker prey. There are no frills, bells, whistles, politics or high drama here. 30 Days of Night is a chilling, and primal human last effort to survive when the Hunters find their prey at their most vulnerable."
"muppet-show","5","1","2","4 January 2008"," Good premise, poor follow-through
","It's always sad to see a movie which has a strong idea as a concept, but then fails to deliver the goods. I have been browsing through some of the commentary already delivered and I am a little surprised to see that no one has mentioned the original graphic novel from which this film was adapted. And as far as comic adoption's go, this one is par for the course. Nothing really special, but not a total disappointment either. What I found interesting about the graphic novel was that the vampire attack was led by a ""renegade"" vampire, who thought it was a good idea to prey on a helpless town and it's inhabitants. This idea was not shared by the vampire leader however and resulted in a brief episode of conflict within the group. This was interesting to me, because it suggested that the vampires were not merely mindless killing machines. This I would have liked to see in the movie as well. As a whole the movie lacks depth in order for it to stand out from all the other horror fare out there. What was very nice was the re-imagination of the vampires. They looked genuinely scary. However their first appearance on-screen was not, which takes away from the tension. There are numerous plot-holes, which have been mentioned by other posters as well. All in all, I was disappointed. I hope there will be an extended directors cut, as I do not consider this the finished product. However I must say that Director David Slade did do a good job in terms of cinematography. Visually the film is brilliant. However for a more solid story with the same premise I suggest you pick up the graphic novel."

"marcdrinkwater","6","1","2","13 December 2007"," Modern Vampire
","This is a very modern day interpretation of the Vampire flick. A remote town in Alaska prepares for 30 days without sunlight and obviously this is ideal for any gang of vampires with 30 nights of free time on their hands.<br/><br/>The town shuts down and the vampires waltz into town spilling blood and wreaking havoc all over.<br/><br/>The hero of the picture is the town sheriff played by Josh Hartnett and the towns folk, led by the sheriff, gradually decreasing in number, battle for survival as the crew of vampires leave the dead in their wake and seek to eliminate the whole town so's ""not to bring attention to themselves"" quite! It is an enjoyable picture, there's lots of action and shocks to keep the average slasher fan on the edge of their seats. I did have an issue with the fact that the townsfolk, when met with a gang of albeit ""vampire like"" murderers, instantly recall all those tricks for disposing of said murderers from their favourite vampire stories- and lo and behold they are right. Also the passage of time seems to fly by, I found it difficult to believe that the action takes place over the said 30 days.<br/><br/>Beyond that its still a good take on the genre. It does lose it's way toward the end and crosses the line between far fetched and downright ludicrous, but then, don't they all? on the genre."

","To be honest I really enjoyed this film, thought it was a good addition to the horror genre and much better than some of the garbage that comes out these days. I thought the acting, effects and story were fine, my only problem with this film and maybe I am been a bit picky is: Day 1 Vampires appear and slaughter most of the town, a group of survivors head into an attic of an abandoned house; a couple of deaths later; Day 3 'Flashes up' there is a snow storm so they head to a weapons store and end up camping out there as the snow storm ends; Day 7 'Flashes up' (a few more deaths) the remaining survivors head to the police station and camp down; Day 27 'FLASHES UP', I was thinking WHAT ? they have camped out for 27 days in the police station eating what ?, why have the vampires not been around looking for these people, why would the vampires have hung around if there was no one left to eat, the survivors see a flashing torch light in a neighbouring house window and decide to investigate, why would you bother ?? Only 3 days to go till sunlight comes back and you take a pointless risk, anyway a few more deaths and in the end with only about 10 minutes till sunrise and Josh Hartnett decides to turn himself into a vampire to save his missus, who clearly was going to be OK anyway as she stood by the truck she was hiding under all the time he was fighting the head vampire and the fire never reached her anyway ! Like I say it was a good film but it would have been more believable had it only been 3 days of night, there was no real reason for it to have been called 30 days of night as Barrow in Alaska actually has around 67 days of night."

"luke-346","6","1","2","7 December 2007"," Not a great addition to the genre, but perhaps some memorable moments
","In what began as a good premise failed to live up to anything of the sort. 30 Days of Night is a not that a good addition to this genre and I feel that when making a contemporary vampire film any correlation to the original novels and ideals can be disregarded in favour of making the film more acceptable to current audiences via other tools, prime examples being ""Blade"", ""Night Watch"" and the ever popular ""From Dusk Till Dawn""  30 Days of Night does this, but not intentionally  as although there is mention of sunlight, there is no mention of garlic, crucifixes or stakes etc and no real reason given for not mentioning them. It also lives up to many horror clichés, including the infuriating aspect of giving certain characters depth when their demise is so blatantly imminent, characters threatening the well-being of the others through panic, fleeing thus jeopardising others and reiterating the obvious.<br/><br/>The title draws the audience into a false sense of what to expect, as we do not witness 30 days of night as on several occasions the narrative leaps several days leaving the audience questioning the protagonists' endeavours over this time and in doing so fails to attract any real level of isolation. The feeling of isolation was far better tackled in John Carpenters ""The Thing"" (also set in cold, desperate conditions near the arctic circle), as was the subject of vampires in his film of the same name.<br/><br/>Evolving from music videos, director David Slade, (Hard Candy) does give us some nice shots and scenes with vampires leaping from rooftops and some well filmed bloodshed - the best of which being the birds-eye tracking shot of the village. It is a very revealing shot, as it not only depicts a sense of isolation and desperation, but also the horror and carnage being experienced by the townsfolk. In fact this and the facial makeup of the vampires were the two real highlights of the film for me. The ending is not, and will leave many people annoyed at its cheesiness."

There is nothing to comment in 10 lines, but I will try. Only god knows for what they got any rewards and nominations, but I assume for some kind of creatures which resemble vampires that you can never kill. Their run faster then a speeding car, leap everything in a single bound and don't die. Basically it's a waste of your time spending any minutes for watching this low-budged film. I like horrors and scary movies but good ones. There are many other films that deserve for attention but not this one and certainly I would never include ""30 days of nights"" to even third-rate film. However if you are very bored and don't have any things to do, you are depressed and want to commit a suicide then I would say ""go for it"". In many other circumstances you'd better wash your dishes which would be much more enjoyable."

","Don't watch this film if you are easily upset by the incessant Garbage that Hollywood is churning out in the Horror Genre. <br/><br/>This film has the following wrong with it.....<br/><br/>1. Incoherent Plot 2. Bad acting from all involved 3. Terrible CGI 4. Not Scary 5. Terrible Characters 6. Un-Original 7. Waste of my time (I want that time back by the way)<br/><br/>The above is just a brief overview of why this is contender for the worst film I have seen in a long time. Please believe me when I say that you'll want to gouge out your own eyeballs rather that sit through this piece of rubbish. here's an idea, why don't the production companies take the budgets for films like this and spend it on more productive things like building a huge statue of Josh Hartnett (worst actor in the film) so that good loyal paying cinema goers can throw rotten fruit and vegetables at it.<br/><br/>As Marlon Brando once said ""The HORROR"" I know what he means after watching this rubbish."
"golosadis","2","2","8","1 December 2007"," why was this film made?
","I started watching this film with high expectations. First several scenes, with small village covered with snow were promising. But soon after that, when I realized that, even though I kept my eyes wide open, I wasn't able to see almost anything on the screen because scenes were so dark that film was barely watchable. Vampires in this film are not scary at all. Reduced from philosophical Gothic monsters in films of the sixties, to mindless beasts without history or charm in this film, they are less scary than a pack of wolves. You almost feel pity for those simple, pathetic, bloodsucking creatures who are freezing on minus 50 C just to get a meal, instead of enjoying immortality in their castle in Romania and waiting their servant Igor to bring them fresh blood in a golden bowl. There are almost no special effects in this film, due to the obviously low budget. That was unsuccessfully compensated with shaky camera and ultra rapid nervous editing which simultaneously prevents you from seeing any detail (which was probably intentional), and makes you feel dizzy. Scary effects are made only by intense music score, loud nerve-wracking sounds, and almost constant screaming. Why was this film made? There is nothing new or original in it. On the contrary, it is full of clichés. There is no scene in it which we hadn't seen in other films at least ten times. This is just yet another exploitation movie."
"istina","4","2","8","29 October 2007"," Almost the stupidest vampires ever
","Usually in a vampire flick I find myself rooting for the vampires because the people are stupid. Instead, I found myself rooting for the end of the film. The vampires were MORONS! They hissed everywhere they went, they looked stupid, they went after their prey like they were canine, and they had STUPID dialogue in a STUPID made-up language. For some reason at the beginning of the movie they cut away from blood and gore, while at the end they showed it in its full. The only reason for that had to be budget, because it added immensely to the inconsistency of the film. The idea for the ending while unique was too short and low-budget. If you want to see a good vampire flick stick to the oldies...Dracula with Bela Lugosi, The Lost Boys, Nosferatu (Klaus Kinski), or even the Ultraviolet series. Save yourself the cash."
"TheEmulator23","5","2","8","24 October 2007"," Great premise, spoiled with mediocrity.
","This film tried too hard to be too many things without settling with one or two good ones. I didn't love this flick but particularly hate it either. I loved the premise of 30 days of night straight. It was a shame that this film couldn't make up it's mind on what it wanted to be. At times it seemed to take itself very seriously and other times it seemed to cartoony in it's presentation. I thought a lot of the set pieces were excellent, most of the casting was pretty believable, (except for Josh Hartnett, not his fault, just the wrong man for the job) some of the camera work wasn't bad, but at other times it was plain sloppy. I personally am sick of the shaky-cam phase plaguing good (could be even better) movies these days. I understand that some people like the shaky-cam, but whenever I see it I think it's either because they are trying to hide something, or they don't know any other way to shoot the scene. I don't know if it's just me but I blame the overabundance of the shaky-cam epidemic on the overrated garbage ""Blair Witch Project."" I'm sure it was there before, but it seems to be around more and more, and it just won't go away. Now I don't always hate it, I just think it is used way too much. Can we tell them that it is going to be almost a decade since ""Blair Witch"" came out. Let's get back to less shakiness and back to some good old fashioned camera shots. I also despised the way ""30 days"" ended, because for anyone that has seen ""Blade 2,"" well you've seen it before, and better. I love Vampire movies, but I felt this great premise of a film was wasted with a terrible script and very little character development. I loved the overall look of the film and would recommend it as far as that is concerned, but for just a decent vampire movie well that is going to be in the eye of the beholder."

","I really enjoy vampire movies, and this one was really hyped. I should have known what a disappointment it was going to be. But I sat there wide eyed trying to make the best of it. The plot had huge gaps in it. What the hell is with the ship in the beginning and where do they go in the end. What is with the horribly misguided sound effects that just appear haplessly through the movie? It was just all around horrible. The vampires themselves were inconsistent. They should all look the same! They're vampires aren't they?... The timing is so off with the elapsing of days and even hours. The time that elapses for one person to turn into a vampire is different than another's?! Really it is just so inconsistent, I could have produced a better film than this.

"imjessietr","4","2","8","22 October 2007"," an amusing waste of time
","Really... just ""haha"". I kinda got that this was going to be a slasher flick, not a cerebral movie, but still ... Jason is a better killer than these guys.<br/><br/>The visuals were very nice, particularly that aerial shot. Still, all the gore was messy. Like others have noted, it's beyond stupid to massacre everyone in the middle of nowhere when time is ticking. Not only that, but the opening attempts by the vampires to keep the town without communication was pointless: who were they trying to keep in? Most people had left already. You woulda thought they would have burned the town and went on to the next town a week or so before sunrise, instead a couple of hours before. Also, there was more characterization in Jurassic Park, and that was paper-thin. Speaking of which, the vampires looked cool but sounded like asthmatic velociraptors. Heck, the raptors were more intelligent than this. I realize, having read some of the comments on here, that some grew tired of stylized or (God forbid) INTELLIGENT vampires ... but, I mean, come ON ... Where are the humans kept as reserves? Why can't there be any survivors except that one guy in the jail, who they also kill later? I had to go over to Wikipedia to learn why the vampires couldn't sense what was so obvious ... this movie did nothing to explain anything, really. I kinda get how some people interpret a lack of vampire ""culture"" as fresh and scary, but I just see it as narrative laziness.<br/><br/>My brother and I couldn't figure out if we were going to root for the humans or the vampires. The multiple time skips seemed unnecessary since apparently, hiding from vampires is quite easy. Just wait a week in each room until the movie's over. All the killings were so over-the-top it was just laughable. I was half-expecting Hot Shots Part Deux-type ""body count counter""-like things to show up so we could keep track of the roughly 20 to 50 people the vampires kill. If Transformers' notion of bringing a big robot war to a heavily populated city was stupid (and I liked that movie), making sure nearly everyone had already left from this Little Town of Nowheresville was even more stupid. How can there be any suspense if nearly everyone is gone? I enjoyed the concept of the ending, but it was poorly executed (pun slightly intended)."

","...the movie, eh, not so much.<br/><br/>The action was few and far between, the acting was paper-thin and the distinct focus on the humans (whose characters, like the action, develop far to infrequently) made for an AMAZINGLY boring horror movie. We are given several sub-plots about the survivors that, in the end, you just don't care about. And (with the exception of the last-stand scene) all the action is the vampires killing the humans (and one of a human killing vamps, but... well... hard to explain). Now, I love the generous gore given here, but it just wasn't enough to save it for me.<br/><br/>As a whole, there wasn't a lot going on here.

"stevenvoskanian","7","2","8","19 October 2007"," A good graphic novel visual adaptation to the big screen (6.5/10)
","First of all I like to say that I gave it a seven because 6.5 is not available, but I rather not take the rating down.<br/><br/>Visually the filmmakers did a great job giving it a dark graphic novel look. The story itself was very interesting and pretty original for choosing Alaska and its month long night to make the situations more desperate than it usually is in vampire films for the humans. The rest I'm afraid is not as well planned. The scary parts are sometimes bogged down by choppiness and too much of reliance on the vampire make ups, teeth-showing and silly repeated hisses by the bloodsucking gang.<br/><br/>The little scary suspense in these scenes is spoiled when their language is subtitled for us so god forbid we use our imagination or be expected to have some patience to see what they will do after.<br/><br/>I was also present at the Q & A with the writers and found out a couple of nifty things were omitted from the ""Future Director's Cut Version"".<br/><br/>For example: Minor SPOILER ALERT**** <br/><br/>The little infected girl about to be beheaded turns human for a moment beg them not to kill her, and that is when her head gets chopped off. There was also a scene that explains better that the vampires came on that frozen ship we see in the beginning. There is also supposed to be scene where it shows they have killed all the other passengers of the ship and their blood flowing through specially designed water ways to the outside of the ship, gathering all of it towards a single exit point.<br/><br/>End of SPOILER**** <br/><br/>In short, if you've seen a lot of scary, action-packed and well-done similar movies of the genre (vampires, Zombies,), this won't be nearly as original or frightening. As for the rest of the audience it is a stylish entry in the genre with a decent twist in the rules existing in vampire movies (remember they don't need to worry about sunlight for a whole month!) It should generally be an enjoyable viewing for most."

","I can usually find at least one good thing about even a mediocre movie that makes it worth watching. I am a huge fan of vampire movies as well. But this movie is pointless. To put it simply, vampires run around mauling people while they scream like little girls. They are near impossible to kill, and there are no heroes to stand in their way. And very random obvious things happen like a young girl walking in the open screaming for help getting murdered by the first vampire she comes across. Vampires kill... yes we know that. Where's the plot!? In addition, there is not a lot to draw an audience to the characters. They have little backgrounds to their lives and lack any admirable or even distinctive traits. Finally, this being a horror movie, misses any elements of fear. People get butchered like they would in a war movie and ooze blood. Where's the suspense?"

","Boring, predictable, churned out and utterly unenjoyable. You've seen it all before. You know exactly what will happen and not one second of it is enjoyable. Not even just as gore-fun. It makes me want to slap love-film in the face for not warning us when we hired it. The characters are the usual group of clichés whining on angstily so that you wish the monsters would come and kill them all off. But then they do, and you are further bored to death by their wittering on in some ridiculous vampirese language. Special effects fans needn't bother either; it's all ropey CGI and boring cliché costumes. If you want a good horror, turn to asia. The original version of The Grudge shows this up as the mass produced tripe it is. If you want a bad horror, turn to Amicus or Hammer.

I'm not going to even comment on the stupidness of the plot or characters because it has been done enough already by others panning this piece of junk. If C- grade makeup and a total absence of tension or scares sound good then this is a perfect movie. What were the actors thinking? Maybe it was a good payday. The script probably brought some chuckles when they read it and then they shrugged and said what the heck, its good money. I can't believe anyone involved with this mess could have thought this would be good at any point, and it shows big time.

Other than a bad beard growing on Josh, there is no concept of time passing or this month long siege that the vampires lay onto the town.<br/><br/>The vampires start off with promise, and then degenerate into some odd Adams family meets the honeymooners.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the plot flaws and ultimately making this out to have some sappy 'after 30 nights of fighting vampires I realize that I was wrong to leave you, honey' ending.<br/><br/>Than I read the pedigree on the director Slade. MTV videos for the Stone Temple Pilots. And it occurred to me, if the Stone Temple Pilots would have started playing in the middle of this movie, it might have had some redeeming qualities. Sam Ramni should have stuck with directing this instead of passing the buck. Some studio is p---ed that they got this product.

","I went to this film expecting to be scared, the idea of vampires with a free reign for 30 days is definitely enough to give me nightmares.<br/><br/>The vampires initially did seem fairly threatening - fast, powerful and brutal. They seemed animal-like compared to most modern portrayals. At some point though, they became lobotomised goons and seemed to switch from ripping peoples throats out to trying to shriek them to death.<br/><br/>The prey was a small group of village survivors who repeatedly made the not so wise decision of leaving their hidey-holey to look for another despite the fact that the vamps had shown no signs of finding them for several days, seemingly due to the lack of any searching or tracking skills or vampiric super smelling. My cat would have found these people in an hour, but then it's partial to regular meals while the vampires were perfectly happy to spend 29 days on the pickings of whatever fool decided to brave the outsides themselves.<br/><br/>What's the point of a 24 hour buffet if there's nothing to eat? Apart from the dim-witted witted vampires and equally dumb towns people, I also found the films constant attempts to disgust and offend grating. I was unable to be particularly shocked by the actions of newly introduced characters, or the deaths of various townspeople I knew little about.<br/><br/>All in all, I was not encouraged to sympathise with the survivalists, or fear the villains - which is a shame, because the basic concept of the film does contain some gold"

Where do they come from? What do they want? besides the obvious... Who is the creepy looking man in the opening scene of the movie who later gets thrown in jail?<br/><br/>These and much more questions are left unexplained through the movie. Perhaps one needs to read the comics first to understand the film? My opinion is that they could have done so much better, being that idea of filming in Alaska in darkness is great... the filmmakers could have done more character development and a decent story.<br/><br/>Gore, creepiness and violence were up to level for today's horror standards; as well as make up and costumes...

"kythia","5","1","3","5 January 2016"," Oldschool vampire horror
","30 Days of Night starts very promising. It plays somewhere in Alaska, which removes the need for a supernatural phenomenon to make the sun go down for thirty days. The lead character, played by Josh Hartnett, has charisma, a simple but acceptable background and does a good job of moving the story forward.<br/><br/>The vampires are portrayed as they should be. As intelligent, bloodthirsty predators with only few human features left. The film succeeds at showing how they prepare their attack on a naturally isolated target area in a subtle way. They even look scary at times, although resemble the wood elves of The Elder Scrolls video games a little too closely for my taste.<br/><br/>However, the movie suffers from a devastating flaw that is far too common to the genre: Overly stupid side characters. Starting with the cliché whiny boy, who has the word ""juicy target"" stamped on his forehead, to the senile elderly, of whom you just know that he'll get someone killed.<br/><br/>It also takes far too long for any character to try out this thing called ""headshots"". A testament to the NRA education of the armed public, I guess.<br/><br/>I just cannot stomach films with monster newbies anymore. Anyone who has ever seen a vampire film would have been considered an accomplish expert at undead extermination by the cast of 30 Days of Night. I do not need a lengthy introduction phase to the nature of horror movies anymore when watching a horror movie. Many other films have successfully solved this problem by adding a character who is a horror fan or has at least heard about the genre.<br/><br/>Another minor flaw is that I never really got the feeling of watching a town go through thirty days of slaughter. Its one night, and not a very long one either. Apart from a few beards growing, there is little that would give it away to the audience.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night is a decent reminder of the ""real"" vampires, before Twilight turned them into cuddly teenager fantasies. It has a lot of substance, but lacks interesting characters and a proper story."

When a town is plunged into a yearly period of total darkness, vampires descend onto the town for dinner, hut the strong willed town's people aren't going down without a fight. Melissa George and Josh Hartnett are exceptional as a recently split couple, this relationship doesn't burden the vampiric excitement, it enlivens it, putting you in fear for their lives, and the situation develops their characters. The camera-work pans slowly stirring tension, and the bloodthirsty vamps jump out regularly so you'll shudder quite a lot. You'll have fun with 30 Days Of Night, it totally brings fresh blood to the genre and is a breathe of fresh air amongst all the Twilight madness."
"Samiam3","5","1","3","4 November 2009"," 30 days of blood and boredom
","If it is a traditional gore fest you want, 30 Days of Night is just the thing for you. The film has its roots in Night of The Living Dead. Personally, I think this formula is getting a bit dull. Just occasionally a filmmaker shows up with a fresh idea in mind, Like Ruben Fleischer with this years hit Zombieland, or before that, Robert Rodriguez with Dusk till Dawn. Everything else is either a remake or a movie like 30 Days of Night. Although these vamps are about as ferocious as they come, they have about as little impact on the film as the heroes who fight them. 30 days of Night is just a bore.<br/><br/>In Barstow Alaska (the northern most point in the state, the last day of sun sees half the town pulling out to go south with the birds. For thirty days every year, no sunlight will ever reach that far north. It is the perfect feeding ground for a family of vampires who show up out of nowhere. The few dozen residents who are staying, get reduced to a few within a matter of hours. The sheriff, has to find a way to keep everyone alive for the next month, until Mr golden sun comes back.<br/><br/>To say that the movie fails because it is unoriginal would be ineffective criticism. More specifically the movie has no energy. It is too slow. Of course there is nothing wrong with that, provided the film offers solid suspense like Aliens. 30 days of Night offers none. Instead it gives us copious amounts of blood which won't even make you flinch. <br/><br/>The only positive thing that stays with you when you walk away from the film, is Danny Huston's performance as the head vampire, kind of amusing. A few nice shots here and there as well as a credible electronic score shine through, but I think 30 Days of Night is dismissible, and should be left in the shadows."
"Agnelin","Null","1","3","21 March 2009"," The best part of the movie is the ending credits
","I'm giving this movie two stars out of ten, for two reasons: one, the premise was good, and a good movie could have been made out of it -definitely, not the case here. And two, the ending credits, which were actually much creepier and more suggestive than all the movie in its entirety.<br/><br/>It would be long and pointless to note all that is completely wrong in ""30 days of night"". To name a few reasons not to watch this piece of nonsense, let's say it's boring, pretentious -especially in the depiction of the ""creatures"", for they aren't really vampires, more on that later-, packed with bad, bad acting; completely devoid of any tension or atmosphere; absolutely not scary (it doesn't even have that couple of predictable yet satisfying scares that even the cheapest horror movies offer); and laughable in too many a scene.<br/><br/>The story makes no sense at all. We are never told a story; rather, we are witnesses to a number of sequences that are closer to action than to what a vampire movie should be. Another big problem with this movie is its complete lack of pace or of build-up: we never feel that we are watching a group of humans trying to survive a vampire attack for 30 days of night, with all the psychological content and depth that that would imply; the passing of time is marked by such a simple device as telling the viewer that it is ""Day 1"", ""Day 18"" or whatever. The characters never look or really act any different on day 18 than they do at the beginning. We never get the feeling that more than one or two days have passed. All the characters are barely sketched, they are interchangeable and we never feel, nor care about their plight.<br/><br/>If all of that weren't enough, this movie throws all of the cinematic and popular vampiric mythology out of the window. The creatures that raid the little Alaskan village are a mix of zombies and ghouls, and they are ugly rather than scary. In fact, it wouldn't be unreasonable to watch it as if the creatures were actually regular wrongdoers or human bad guys instead of monsters.<br/><br/>Those are only a few of the many flaws about ""30 days of night"", but I believe they are enough to put anyone off watching it... indefinitely."

","30 DAYS OF NIGHT is for those who have become fed-up of Hollywood's tendency to cast vampires as pretty-boy, emo, tortured soul types with whom the audience is supposed to sympathise. The 'vampires' in 30 DAYS OF NIGHT (at least we are made to assume that they are vampires) are nowhere near worthy of sympathy, and are some of the most horrific and frightening monsters seen on film in recent years.<br/><br/>The movie is continually adrenaline-filled, and is paced well in order to maintain the tension. The story itself is a decent one, and while maintaining the requisite visceral appeal of a film of this nature, begs a critical question at its core: ""How much would one sacrifice to save the one(s) he love(s)?"" This question becomes apparent and palpable during the last hour or so of the Motion Picture, leading to the chilling climax, which blends together aspects of beauty and of horror.<br/><br/>The cast is adequate, and Josh Hartnett manages to shine in his protagonist hero role. Not a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but it remains to be seen whether this film will withstand the test of time 8/10. A solid 3 stars (out of 4). May garner a place in my Honourable Mention list. David Slade's follow-up to the tasteless HARD CANDY is quite recommended."

","This flick, based on the Niles/Templesmith comic definitely had the potential to make a decent movie, but the vampires and their weird Klingon sounding dialogue just didn't work for me, kind of took away from the suspense and made them less menacing and decidedly goofy really. Less vampiric hissing would've been most welcome. Kinda reminded a little of the theatrical cut of ""Land of The Dead"" (still a better movie) where the lead zombie is always moaning constantly. Less is usually more. Hartnett was good and well cast, and there were some good moments, despite the crappy vamp antics, but I would've preferred that they not have changed the end as it was in the book. That's my take anyway."

","The world really doesn't need another vampire movie ... but this one is pretty good anyway. While the plot is pretty basic, the acting, visuals and concept make this movie appealing.<br/><br/>The movie is set in Barrow, Alaska - the northernmost point in the United States. The city is about to enter a yearly 30 day period where the sun doesn't rise. Unfortunately, this time there are some nasty visitors. When the sun sets, the inhabitants must hide to survive ... and the story progresses from there.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty standard - hide and seek with the bad guys. However, the geographic isolation of the city and the 30-day period of night give the movie an interesting atmosphere. Furthermore, the characters / acting are pretty good. The characters are smart and easy to relate to.<br/><br/>The vampires, while only a step above shrieking zombies, are very freaky-looking. Whoever was responsible for the visuals did a great job. Barrow looks pretty isolated and sparse, so it's easy to get a feeling of desolation and helplessness.<br/><br/>If you like movies which employ a strong sense of isolation (like Alien, The Shining, The Thing), chances are you'll appreciate this movie all the more.

And I can't say 30 Days of Night changed that, either.<br/><br/>The good: - Quite bloody, compared to modern movies. - Camera-work was brilliant. - The premise was brilliant. - The ending was neat.<br/><br/>The bad: - The vampires were as cheesy as humanly possible. - I was so bored I almost left the theater. - They couldn't resist using the insanely cliché little girl scene. - The cut-off scenes (and there were quite a few) dumbed it down.<br/><br/>Overall: I guess I'm just glad someone made an atmospheric, bloody movie with somewhat of a punk spin to it.<br/><br/>4/10"

","At first i didn't know what to expect from this film.<br/><br/>For me the vampire genre has been ever changing. I have previously enjoyed the classical style of vampire films, for example Bram Stoker's 'Dracula', and i felt that audiences did feel that they were truly frightening.<br/><br/>However the completely different 'Blade' and 'Underworld' style films, have been equally effective and i feel that they can be truly scary to the modern audience, although can sometimes be somewhat naff and cheesy.<br/><br/>With such a variation in the vampire genre, i did not know where '30 Days Of Night' would fit in. Would it be a good, frightening vampire film, or a comical, iconic 'lost boys'-esquire film.<br/><br/>It turns out it was a brilliant, frightening, well made horror film.<br/><br/>The acting was very good and i felt that Josh Hartnett was a very good lead actor. The story was brilliant ( i realise it was inspired by a graphic novel), and the vampires themselves were a new and exciting 'breed'.<br/><br/>The one downside however were some of the unexplained survival issues, but these were overlooked by the positive aspects of the film.<br/><br/>I thoroughly recommend this film to all lover's of the Vampire genre. It is a very interesting and exciting film."

","In Alaska for 30 days, sun light is absent and in this darkness; the creatures of the dark arrive to feast. Based on a comic book, the movie brings the comic book feel with gory scenes and special effects.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett is a talented actor but is underrated mainly because of his good-looks and shy personality; he plays a sheriff, brother and husband. Another actor who is underrated is Ben Foster; here he is known as the Stranger who creates a sinister vibe of what is yet to come.<br/><br/>The scenery is amazing and shows just lonely the Alaska landscape is and sends a chill down ones back when you think of the plot, of the movie. As the film progresses the theme becomes clear, its survival.The camera work is brilliant as the audience sees the massacre that is taking place in the town that is defenceless against the Vampires.

","David (Hard Candy) Slade directs this nerve-jangling adaptation of the popular graphic novel series about a mob of vampires that overruns a remote Alaskan town in the grip of 30 Days of Night. Josh Hartnett and Melissa George are the film's DE facto heroes (he's the stoic town sheriff and she's his estranged fire-marshal wife) but the picture's real MVP is Slade's camera (along with cinematographer Jo Willems), which careens across the town's snowy landscape to detail the vampires' horrific assault on its inhabitants, which are quickly pared down to a hardy few. The script, co-written by the source material's creator, Steve Niles, along with Pirates of the Caribbean's Stuart Beattie and Hard Candy's Brian Nelson), proudly wears its influences on its crimson-stained sleeve (Bram Stoker's Dracula, natch, but also Salem's Lot, Night of the Living Dead, and John Carpenter's version of The Thing) and boils down the graphic novels to a series of tense and extremely bloody standoffs between Harnett and George's band of survivors and the vaguely Slavic and ferocious bloodsuckers led by Marlow (a feral and frightening Danny Huston). And if the characters seem stock and the finale begs suspension of disbelief, the set pieces leading up to it are sufficiently supercharged with suspense and violence to please most horror fans. Standouts in the supporting cast are Ben Foster as the film's Renfield figure and Mark Boone Junior; the disturbing score by Brian Reitzell also merits a mention."

","Vampires myth is there in western world for centuries. In Hollywood cinema too they came to existence right from the beginning. In most of the movies the vampires would be seductively attractive ones and seduce their prey and in the time of making love they will bite. Sex and horror mix was there which is an effective thrill.<br/><br/>Off late few movies tried to view the vampires myth in different perspectives. Some viewed them as a sect / race. Interview with a vampire even talked about a good hearted Vampire who never killed humans for centuries. John carpenter's vampires moved in a different direction by treating them as just creatures and mainly concentrated on hunting.<br/><br/>This movie goes in creatures way. Vampires are not seducing demons but they act like violent were wolfs. They don't do magic. Don't fly. Incapable of acting as innocents. But they make noises as animals, speak some language, even their teeth too just grown enough like an animal, they are strong and effective like a strong wild animal, and they are violent. They live and hunt in groups. Bit cunning in catching their prey. And they are believably effective. <br/><br/>The story line is interesting. In the north most Alaskan town sun will not rise for one whole month. Which is a very lovely spot for vampires to live. They come by a ship and start hunting the entire town. One group of people try to survive among these creatures.<br/><br/>With this story plot, the movie does not have time to explain character formation etc. Just packed events which were enough for us to be thrilled till the end. There are some painful emotional moments too. The photography was excellent. Acting and music were enough to fit. The sheriff had major part of role in the movie which he does it for good. In the whole movie we see just one sunset at the beginning and one sun rise at the end. The rest is just snow and ice and grayish darkness. It also shows how human will can raise at odds by sacrificing one's self for the sake of the others to survive.<br/><br/>If you watch it expecting to see a Vampire similar to the one of a Bram Stoker's Dracula then you get disappointed. It is not horror but thrilling to the end with some gory scenes. It's not a stylish vampire but a raw animal-like vampire that you can enjoy it. Cannot come into a classic list. but a good entertainment."

","I'm not a big fan of the Vampire genre but was really surprised at how impressed I was by this film. I was slightly apprehensive of this movie at first, but 10 minutes in, I new I had struck gold.<br/><br/>The horror genre has been doubled over so many times, i'm starting to lose count of how many similar films are all out there, borrowing plots and ideas off each other. 30 days of night was refreshingly different, a welcome change of pace. Where most Vampire films show the creatures as humans with a different, emotional side to them; 30 days showed them as vicious creatures who don't want anything but food and death.<br/><br/>The special prosthetics used on the actors to turn them into blood-thirsty monsters were simply excellent, leagues ahead of the CGI used in the $150m blockbuster I Am Legend.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty inspiring, Josh Hartnett & Melissa George were excellent in their quite basic roles. They played their parts with a finesse matched by only a few actors of 2007.<br/><br/>My only real gripe with this film is that it is slightly too long for a horror movie and the ending is a bit too sentimental.<br/><br/>The only horror film to beat it of 2007 was the new remake of Halloween by Rob Zombie. Overall, an excellent, tense movie which is also a visual treat for any viewer."

","I am not a particular fan of Vampire movies, nor of graphic novels generally, let alone the one upon which this was apparently based.My high rating does not acknowledge a cinematic masterpiece, but a genre piece well made, well told.<br/><br/>Much has been made about so called ""factual"" errors and plot ""holes"" 'which totally miss the point.You are invited to suspend disbelief. If you, do you will have a ball, if you don't it is a nonsense.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett, as Sheriff Eban Oleson, is the fulcrum of the tale and does a fine job carrying the film for a full 113 minutes, about twenty minutes longer than a film like this normally demands.Although generously strewn with verbal and situational clichés the stylish presentation and pacey editing keeps things moving.<br/><br/>The vampires themselves owe more to the Zombies genre, than the Vampire one.Their sub titled incomprehensible language adding to a sense of mystery and menace.Producer Sam Raimi's hand looms large here. The core of the story plays on our fears of what happens when it gets dark, and we are all alone and our mind starts to run away with primitive fears, which is why it works so well. it is an Everyman story well delivered.<br/><br/>I suspect that hardcore ""Vampiristas"" may be disappointed by this film which occupies a large chunk of the conventional horror/ Zombie/ slasher genres, which is of course what makes it successful. For there is enough for fans of all of these to thoroughly enjoy."

The film is enough bloody and brutal and have a lots of cool death which makes me scary. Main actor - Josh Hartnett is very good in this movie. He play a young and nervous cop when night being aproching. In the end of movie he days to save the other people. The last scene when he gets burned by sun is strongly emotionally. The dialogues is kinda excellent at some time, like this one in the cell, a madman talk to Josh: ""I don't talk to deadman!"" It's kinda funny and scary at the same time.

","It feels like it's been awhile since a vampire movie has been released (apart from the crappy Blade: Trinity).<br/><br/>30 Days of Night is a decent action movie, however, it doesn't do characters very well. I found myself not really caring when any of them died. The whole marriage-on-the-rocks subplot also seemed pretty pointless and poorly executed.<br/><br/>Another problem, was that the enemy (vampires) that the group was facing were just WAY too powerful. The vampires were fast enough to catch up to a speeding car and strong enough to flip that car completely over, they could jump at least 20 feet into the air, they were very agile fighters, they were pretty intelligent, and on top of that there were at least 50 of them hunting a group of 5.<br/><br/>Also, the ending was pretty ridiculous, even for a vampire movie.<br/><br/>So, why did I give it a 5/10? Well, between all the awfully developed characters and the stupid ending. The movie had some suspenseful scenes. All the blood and action in the beginning had me believing that the small town stood a chance against this (then unidentified) enemy."

","So you say you like your vampires that are all harpsichord-playing, puffy-shirt wearing, emo-with-extra-eye-shadow and a side order of existential angst to go? If that's your cuppa blood, you might want to stay as far away from 30 DAYS OF NIGHT as you can. Here, there be monsters. These vamps are not quick with witty bon-mots, not romantic, seductive or sexy by any stretch of the imagination. They look at human beings the way we look at cattle. They're hungry. You're food. End of story. <br/><br/>And if that were just the story, that alone would be enough. If you've seen the vampires from movies like JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRE$, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN and NEAR DARK, you know the damage they can do; the havoc they can wreak.<br/><br/>Now...imagine them doing it in a town where THERE IS NO DAYLIGHT.<br/><br/>And that is the basic premise, just like the graphic novel it's based on, (which I hadn't read before seeing this, but I will sure read the entire series now!) In Barrow, Alaska, there is a period during the start of winter's depths, where there is no sunrise or sunset for a month. Those who can't bear the ""longest night of the year"" get the you-know-what out of Dodge, while the hardier souls stay to tough it out.<br/><br/>Only this year, that thirty-day period is going to change the lives of the town and its inhabitants forever. A stranger is coming...and right behind him, Death follows. <br/><br/>Video and now feature-director David Slade cut his teeth with HARD CANDY for his big- screen debut. I have not seen that film, but it comes highly recommended...with a warning. I guess it's going to be a pattern with his movies, because I am definitely making the same kind of recommendation with 30 DAYS. Lovers of anemic, bland, PG-13 rated schlock should probably stop reading here and go see the PROM NIGHT remake for the eighteenth time. Slade kicks it old-school here - kind of like a Hammer film on steroids, without the heaving cleavage and horse-and-carriage chases - and doesn't skimp on the blood and violence. <br/><br/>It's also great that at least some time is taken for character development before the slaughtering starts. The usually ill-used Josh Hartnett shines here as Barrow's sheriff and reluctant hero Eben Olesen, a role that allows him to be much less...pretty, shall we say, than some of the romantic dramedy stuff he used to get pigeonholed into. Melissa George also made a great first impression on me as Stella, Eben's strong-willed, feisty ex, whose moxie definitely comes in handy when things get hairy...and ""FANG-EY""... <br/><br/>And kudos must definitely go to Ben Foster (SIX FEET UNDER, X-MEN 3, HOSTAGE), for playing a character so skeevy you can almost SMELL HIM whenever he comes on-screen. Ditto to underrated actor Danny Huston, who makes one of the most wholehearted commitments to a role of pure, black-hearted evil I have seen since Anthony Hopkins went hunting for a nice Chianti to go with the fava beans. His late dad, John, would be proud.<br/><br/>I know that most audiences these days just want their blood and guts and they want it NOW, but be patient and give this flick a chance. It does take its time getting started, but once it does, it becomes pretty clear that its R-rating was well-earned. <br/><br/>And I have to mention that this is one of the most beautiful-looking horror films recently. The photography and art direction are unbelievable, (check out the DVD extras for the striking comparison between the movie stills and the novel's original artwork.) And the impressive visual and special effects come courtesy of the WETA Workshop in New Zealand. If you are a LORD OF THE RINGS fan, a Peter Jackson fan, or know anything about this outfit, you know that's all I need to say...It's the equivalent of having Tom Savini, Rick Baker and John Carl Buechler all working together at once. <br/><br/>30 DAYS OF NIGHT is definitely one of the best and most terrifying two-hour periods you will ever spend in the dark...But at least, unlike a good portion of the people of Barrow, YOU will survive it..."

","Every year Barrow, Alaska is subjected to 30 days of night. As this causes severe ice and cold, there is an exodus of its population to warmer climes on the final day. Sheriff Eben Oleson is troubled by his recent marriage split with Stella, who is one of those leaving town, but a strange accumulation of events prevents her going. Odd things begin to happen as the sun plummets below the horizon for a final time, all the pack dogs in town are found mutilated, the power station is shut down, the phone lines are cut, computers are down, could the troublesome stranger in the local jail be responsible, he taunts Eben, that they don't know what is happening and that THEY are coming. Based on a graphic novel, the sleeves blurb states that this is ""the best vampire movie in decades"" is a lot to live up to. The film starts slowly, as we are introduced to all the main characters, but once the sun goes down all hell is released in Barrow and the film picks up plenty of pace. The mysterious horde of vampires are not explained, nor is their presence there, they move with Matrixlike speed and look more like fast moving zombies than the usual Gothic fare you might be used to, it's a refreshing look, their speed adds to the doom, as escape from their clutches seems nigh on impossible as within minutes of the sheriff's warning to stay indoors, dozens of inhabitants are slaughtered in the street and feasted upon in an apocalyptic frenzy. The snowy setting is also splendidly atmospheric and rather beautiful and fitting of such a claustrophobic film. The ending leaves the possibility open for a sequel, for once I'm very interested in that."

Josh Hartnett is superb as the gutsy sheriff and Melissa George as his love interest, although this move doesn't have time for much of that. This is all about the rather cool and nasty vampire clan that attack this small town led by a very sinister Danny Huston. Very simple, they intend to kill EVERYBODY, and then leave without a trace to return to another such town next year.

"philip-caveney","8","1","3","9 April 2008"," Better than average vampire movie
","Hands up all of you who like a good vampire movie! Uh huh. And when was the last time you saw one? Thought so. See, vampire movies have been severely hampered of late by having to rein the nastiness in so the movie can qualify for that all-important 15 certificate. A pretty pointless exercise, I think you'll agree. Well, fear not, for help is at hand. 30 Days of Night is set in Barrow Alaska, the northernmost town in America, where (as the title suggests) the inhabitants have to endure not only freezing cold weather but a whole month without a hint of sunshine. Unfortunately, this comes to the attention of a band of decidedly skanky looking blood-suckers, who quickly realise they won't have to put up with any of that annoying, 'back in your coffin by dawn' nonsense. And they're smarter than your average vamp. First of all they set about depriving the town of any means of communication with the outside world and then, this achieved, they set about chowing down on the inhabitants, aided and abetted by the liberal application of an 18 certificate. So as you may imagine, events get fairly visceral. The film is based on a graphic novel, but don't let that put you off. Josh Hartnett is the handsome young sheriff, charged with the task of facing up to these unwelcome visitors. He's recently separated from his young wife (and fellow law enforcer) Stella (Melissa George) and it doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to predict that the ensuing struggle is likely to bring them back together. Can they and the few pitiful survivors of the initial attack survive for the next 30 days? Director David Slade (who stood in for original helmer, Sam Raimi) does a good job of keeping things moving briskly along and some of the gore effects (particularly the decapitations) are extremely realistic. More importantly, vampirism gets a bit of a makeover here, with a few angles we haven't seen before. OK, so the human characters suffer from the ever-familiar failing of taking simply ages to realise that though they are fighting the undead, the simple precedent of shredding them into the human equivalent of Kitty Kat will slow them down considerably. But that's a given in this genre and even the film's rather downbeat ending makes a refreshing break from the norm. Overally, I thought this worked and it's a shame that holding out for the 18 certificate denied it any success in movie theatres. Hopefully, its DVD release will make up for it. Those with delicate stomachs may prefer to skip this and watch The Chipmunks Movie instead. It's your loss."
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","1","3","5 April 2008"," Much better than I expected.
","30 Days of Night starts out with a fascinating introduction to its fascinating setting, Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost city in America. A quick look at Google earth with reveal this to be true  Barrow is very near Barrow Point, the northern tip of North America. I have a strange fascination with places like this. I'll probably never make it out there, but when I hear of places like that it always makes me want to visit them. For now, however, I'll have to settle for this vampire movie, which in many ways is better than average, but is less than average in many other ways. <br/><br/>Josh Hartnett plays the town Sheriff, Eben Oleson, who spends his days crossing the t's and dotting the i's of his job, often just keeping up the formalities or other times in order to make the citizens, even the ones living alone out in the frozen wilderness, remember that they are all part of the town. You see, it's a pretty quiet life that they lead up there in the far north.<br/><br/>Before long, however, some Strange Occurrences start taking place, with increasingly mysterious implications and circumstances, and then animals and people start turning up brutally killed. Structurally the film is pretty routine, but it's location adds a new element to the genre, and some of the photography is outstanding. There are a few aerial shots of the carnage, for example, some while the killing is actually taking place, which are some of the best shots I've ever seen in a vampire film. <br/><br/>Similarly, the vampires themselves are impressively performed, despite your occasional overacting. The special effects and make up come together for an impressive affect that reminds me of those unbelievably creepy Asian schoolgirls in that LFO music video called ""Freak."" I recommend it, it's crazy.<br/><br/>Before long, as is to be expected, you have a core group of the townspeople, the only survivors, we can presume, holed up somewhere sleeping in shifts, taking turns on watch out, rationing food, etc, and of course there is somewhere that ""if they can reach it they'll have enough food to last a month."" This has all been done who knows how many times, but there is something added to the personality of the vampires that I hadn't seen before. <br/><br/>There is an interesting hierarchy to them, they are stratified with a leader and his minions followed by I imagine an army of lower level vampires that obey orders. In order to achieve motive for the screenplay's need for the whole town to be exterminated, the leader actually makes a clever statement, telling his followers that it has taken them centuries to make people believe that they were just a bad dream, so the humans all had to be destroyed to prevent the escape of any eyewitnesses. Evidently he's unaware of the real world response that a group of people would get from the rest of America if they were to come forward and claim that a horde of vampires had wiped out the entire population of the country's northernmost city. <br/><br/>And one thing that I have to mention, the ending of the film (which is generally the worst part of most horror movies) is outstanding. Sheriff Oleson, in order to save the rest of the survivors, infects himself with vampire blood and then battles the vampires on his own before he fully transforms into one of them. <br/><br/>There is, of course, going to be the standard complaint that the sun doesn't ""set"" one day and then lead to 30 days of darkness, but I should think that such a thing is irrelevant to a movie like this. In reality, think of it like the sun rises lower and lower in the sky as winter approaches, finally doing sort of a ring along the horizon for some time during winter, at which time it's never really daytime and never really nighttime. I've always wanted to see that. <br/><br/>Although the movie is not without plot holes (there is an eerie shot of a ship ominously approaching the shore in the opening of the movie, which one of the vampires watches with some mixture of fascination and fear, and yet we never find out anything about it), the last shot in the movie is the perfect ending to the story, and the movie also, by the way, has what might be the most graphic beheading I've ever seen. If you're into that, don't miss this one!"

The nice haircuts and styling on these vampires got me trying to figure out which one went to the TVIHM: The Transylvanian Vocational Institute of Hair and Makeup. They must take baths occasionally, I mean if they stayed this messy as they get in this film throughout the eternities, they'd start getting really rough around the edges pretty quickly. They don't seem to eat their prey either, just kind of ripping people to bits is enough.<br/><br/>Besides the obvious logical errors in the plot, it's kind of like having the shower scene in psycho copied and replayed about 50 times until you're saying to yourself - ""oh, there have been 45.5 seconds of calm, something 'shocking' is around the bend"" - otherwise the story would have nothing to keep you watching - character development is not employed in this film.

What the remaining citizenry doesn't expect is an accompaniment of blood-thirsty vampires, ready to feast on the town with a vengeance. Somehow, sheriff Eben Oleson(Josh Hartnett)and estranged wife Stella(Melissa George)will have to band the remaining survivors together awaiting the sunlight to shine once again. But, that will not be an easy task as the vampires will always be on the hunt for fresh victims to supply their blood-lust..<br/><br/>I loved the predatory look of the vampires, Danny Huston is terrifying as the leader(..loved that one scene where the big tractor guy tries to blow himself up and Huston's vampire ridicules him as taking an easy way out since his inferior abilities could not match their own), and I found some interesting similarities in tone to John Carpenter's THE THING. I found the opening scene, with the ship afar as their human slave is about to remove the abilities of the town's escape and cry for help, startlingly effective. Love the closing scene as a major character begins to ash as the sun rises. I really like Melissa George. Liked her in the blah AMITYVILLE HORROR remake and found her very good here as well. Hartnett is just too young for his role. He's too handsome, as well. I agree with Leroy..too many attractive folks in a town such as Barrow so removed from society. And, too many ""suggested"" gore scenes. I want to see head chopping(..well, maybe not towards the one man, bitten by the girl)and this film delivers it perhaps once..I did like how the film shows that head chopping isn't as easy as you'd think. And, I was never quite convinced of the whole ""30 days"" concept. I think they would've been a little more worse for wear if they would've been stuck within the confines of such a ravaged town with limited means to sustain them, coupled with an intense fear and little obvious rest considering you have to always keep an eye out for the baddies. Liked that the vampires communicate in a foreign language. My favorite sequence is an aerial shot showing the vampiric rampage on the township as the slaughter commences with lots of screaming and bullet-fire. Love how the vampires are so carnivorous."

If these dauntless souls endure, they can tell the whole world that vampires do exist. And, they can tell the world that these creatures will stop at nothing to feed their blood-lust. Humanity has to know of their existence, so that next time, humankind will be prepared to fight them. All they have to do is to wait for the sun to come up. In thirty days, it will all be over...! 30 Days of night is not your typical vampire movie. There are no beguiling Lestats or devastatingly-seductive Draculas. The creatures of 30 Days of Night are hellish, seemingly unstoppable, monsters. They hunt in packs and use bloodied children as bait. At first, their attacks seem frenzied and opportunistic. But as the movie progresses, you realise that they are highly-intelligent killing machines, who will stop at nothing to preserve their existence. As I previously said, 30 Days of Night is trying to stay away from old vampire clichés. No wooden stakes or holy water here, but there is still the odd-nod to Bram Stoker. Ben Foster's character, the Stranger, is a modern interpretation of Renfield. And the eerie ship that lands on the shores of Alaska could be Dracula's ship, the Demeter, itself. Most of the performances are solid, with only Danny Huston and Ben Foster standing out from the crowd. Ben Foster seems to be emerging as the current actor to watch. He is following up a memorable performance in 3.10 to Yuma, with an enticingly, menacing turn as the Stranger in 30 days of Night.<br/><br/>The film, 30 Days of Night, is an atmospheric thrill-ride. It is packed to the teeth with frightening encounters and gory demises. It has enough blood-soaked slaughter to appease even slasher fans. And, it has enough mythos and chilling ambiance to please the purists. In short, this film is a palpitating shocker that will enthral most horror fans."

","Barrow,Alaska is a place where for thirty days out of the year,the sun no longer shines.On the first day of night,strange drifter(Ben Foster) mysteriously shows up,causing a disturbance at the local diner and immediately under suspicion for killing a family's pet dogs.Promptly hauled off to the local jail by cop Eben Olsen(Josh Hartnett),The Stranger portentously speaks of death coming,a warning that comes true when the town is overtaken by a gang of ruthless vampires and the citizens are slowly butchered...This nasty and bloody action vampire flick really surprised me.David Slade of ""Hard Candy"" fame makes great use of the cold,blue arctic look of Alaska which greatly intensifies the terror.The cast is adequate with Josh Hartnett in the lead role and the gore is plentiful.Worth a look."
"shadowman123","7","1","3","31 December 2007"," a deep, dark and depressing way to end 2007
","From the trailers 30 days of Night looked like a good Vampire movie however with an out landish plot I decided to go ahead and check it out anyway. Set in the desolate and isolated town of Barrow in Alaska close to the Artic circle, 30 Days of Night is about a group of Vampires who decent on the town and its people after the town is plunged into darkness for a month. The good part about this movie is that well it was the right time of the year to realise it with the 'coldness' to it. The film did not waste anytime getting into the action as well most of these people are going to die anyway so who cares however Josh Harnett who I agree with most people was a little too young for this role but I felt that he carried him-self well. There was a miserable and depressing tone throughout the movie which really help set the mood and a very clever use of film colours which made one feel the harshness of the Arctic circle. For truly the real stars of the shows had to be the Vampires! not only was the interaction top-notch but also they didn't behave like Bella Lugusi ! These lot were fierce , savage and brutal and it was brilliant watching them on screen with a genuine creepiness to the way they howl (guess they don't like the cold either) and some great killing styles which made you jump here and there, with an eerie silence you didn't know where the would strike from. Having said the problems occur with the story , its starts of good but then feels rushed and messy and at one point we lose track of what is going on. Robert Kneepper still reminds me of Tea Bag out of prison break and the camera work just feels like a child was doing it and although the dim colouring did help it became a little too dark to follow in most places. Another thing was towards the end it just felt rush because it seemed that Evan knew a little tooo much about the Vampires?...when did he become Blade ? To conclude 30 Days of Night is truly big on the entertainment value however having said that it has its share of faults but if willing to see past them it is a good , brutal , fast movie and a good edition to the Vampire genre. Defientley worth a look at when it hits the rental stores.<br/><br/>30 DAYS OF NIGHT : 7.8 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>THEY HAVE LIVED IN THE SHADOWS, THEY ARE THE LAST OF THEIR KIND, BUT IN THE ARTIC CIRCLE, WHERE NIGHT NIGHT LAST FOR 30 DAYS... THEIR TIME HAS COME AGAIN!<br/><br/>HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE"

"DICK STEEL","7","1","3","29 November 2007"," A Nutshell Review: 30 Days of Night
","While we're about a month away from the season of good tidings and the new year, what we have lined up for the next 4 weeks or so are 4 cinematic releases that deal with zombies, the supernatural and the undead. We have been teased with Aliens Vs Predators again in a town where the humans stand in their way and become sacrificial pawns. We have Will Smith in I Am Legend being the last man on Earth fending off strange creatures in the night. We have a group of shoppers stuck in a supermarket when Stephen King unleashes The Mist on them. And I actually enjoyed the latter 2 trailers for having adopted some bars off Clint Mansell's soundtrack for The Fountain (will we see more, since Requiem's was used ever so often).<br/><br/>And the competition amongst them starts with 30 Days of Night, adapted from a graphic novel, which tells of the small town on Barrow in the northernmost part of Alaska having to go through 30 days without sunlight in winter, and those who can't stand the cold and the thought of living without sunlight, have opted to leave. It's pretty much business as usual, until a bunch of vampires decide to crash in and feast. And this is the beginning of one of my gripes about the film, as hokey as how the Superman comics team dreamt up of Doomsday - it just appears, with zero thought about justification and the whys and the hows. Um, so we're to believe that this group of super bloodsuckers led by Danny Huston's Marlow have been idling for centuries somewhere on Earth where the sun doesn't shine, before deciding that they have to respond to that rumble in the stomach.<br/><br/>So once you can believe that, and the thought of it dismissed by a one-liner, it's a pretty gory vampire flick on most accounts. They're infused with 28 Days/Weeks styled speed and utter craving for plasma, and as a team, their moves are very keenly calculated. Thinking it's hip to invent languages, we learn Vampire-speak too, though most of the time their fangs get in the way of their pronunciation, so they sound like they're choking on thick clotted blood. Watching the way they dispatch their sorry victims, even though the camera cuts away just at the point of teeth plunging into jugular veins like how rabid dogs attack, you still feel a frightening chill when the view comes back to jolting bodies having their liquids sucked dry, and those scenes are disturbing, even after you leave the theatre. Those fingernails cum talons too provide our vampires with a facial weapon, and how you wish they use it to silence themselves each time they lapse into their orgasmic shrieks.<br/><br/>Director David Slade of Hard Candy fame knows how to create tension and horror without showing you much, and that happens to be a plus point with its extremely patient build up, and the heightening of suspense. You have to tip your hat at him for crafting a very quiet movie at crucial scenes, so much so that the audience lend their ""Ssshhhhs"" not to tell fellow audience to keep quiet, but aimed at the characters themselves to remain like little mice lest they get detected. 30 Days of Night is a very grey movie in mood, tone and the weather, with occasional white landscapes littered with splatters of crimson, and with Slade just loving to provide us overhead views of the town run aground by rampaging monsters.<br/><br/>The humans here though behave like typical vampire movie fodder. The bigger the ensemble, the more victims it can provide, not counting anonymous folks seen being victims from afar. Josh Hartnett's Sheriff Eben plays hero as he leads his bewildered town kinsman to survive through this 30 days of mayhem before the sun shines again, while trying to work out his estranged relationship with wife Stella (a very pouty Melissa George from Turistas, and I still say she's a dead ringer for Estella Warren!). As usual, you have a team of misfits feeding off each other's strength in a quest for survival, and a theme such as Sacrifice is never too far away from movies like these.<br/><br/>But what I felt was a let down to its build up, was the unsatisfying ending, which left a bitter aftertaste with its abruptness and inability to resolve anything substantial. It also didn't allow for any sympathy for the victims as you would sometimes find yourself rooting for another kill just to satisfy your blood lust, also because little time is given for you to get to know those characters. As the humans learn that guns do zilch to their targets, there goes all hope, and try as they could to get creative in turning the tables, it boiled down to keeping it simple. Oh, and if you enjoyed the supermarket scene, I'd bet it served as a precursor to The Mist.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night could have been a lot more, but unfortunately left some bits to be desired. If you truly want to enjoy this new age vampire movie, then I suggest leaving any inquisitiveness at the door, as the movie offers no answers nor clues to answer your whys. Perhaps a reading of the graphic novel might help."
"ScottyAtomic","7","1","3","1 November 2007"," I don't see it.
","I know some of my friends and a lot of vampire enthusiasts loved this film, but I don't see it. This whole plot just seems like a vampire re-hash of Night of the Living Dead (and Alive to a lesser extent). I found nothing original in this film other than the geographic location. That gimmick actually failed to click on a lot of levels for me, because it makes the whole film seem like it takes place over one night. I saw little evidence of the passage of time other than Hartnett's facial hair.<br/><br/>The other aspect that failed for me was the romance/sub-plot. I kept wondering why they dabbled into the divorce/separation and never really addressed it. Did they not have enough freaking time in that attic to get their personal business out in the open? ""No, I think we should just sit here and stare at each other for a couple of weeks and not talk about the only other plot going on in our film..."" <br/><br/>It's a capable film, I assure you. But fresh, original? Haven't found it in here."

","Now don't get me wrong, I love me some vampire movies and gore and blood and gratuitous violence just like the next movie freak but after the first hour of this particular one I had to keep myself from walking out of the theater.<br/><br/>Great setting, Hartnett does a very very good job as the sheriff and I loved the grittiness and reality of the town which they lived in. Great set up with how the action starts but then for me it quickly dwindled into a very very average flick. I'm tired, so very tired of seeing cliché after cliché in regards to monster movies. Are vampires intelligent? Do they dress nice? Do they speak their own language? Who really knows but if done well, a vampire movie can retain old feel as well as inject new as well. Having mindless drones run around screeching at the camera at every chance with that continuous open mouth, show me the fangs stare, does get tiresome quickly. Break the mold such as was done with zombies in 28 days later. Now of course they weren't dead in 28 days so how could they really be zombies but it was implied and the fact that they were the way they were due to a contagion did little to lessen the effect of the movie. <br/><br/>This movie dragged longer than it should have and left too many holes and unanswered questions. Great build up with just as much of a letdown in the overall story. The ending didn't satisfy me as a viewer who wanted to see a very climactic finish. Very average which is a shame because it really did have a lot going for it at the start."
"yfguitarist","6","1","3","24 October 2007"," Best partial beheading...ever!
","I'll start with<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>-It starts off slow in what may have been an attempt to build atmosphere and character development, but it didn't really work for me. -The random kills scattered through the first half weren't great, either. I would've rather seen a single shot of the action instead of many jump cuts - it would've been much more disturbing and horrifying. -The token little (vampire) girl saying, ""Wanna play with me?"" was a failed attempt to be scary. It could've earned points for showing her get killed on screen. -The vampires' dialogue was cheesy.<br/><br/>The good: <br/><br/>-Easily the best decapitation I've ever seen in a film, horror or otherwise. The camera is right in there for the best possible shot, and the make-up effects are flawless and incredibly realistic. Up until this point the gore had been lacking, but this made it all worthwhile for a gore aficionado like myself. Really - it knocks DAY OF THE DEAD out of my previous top gore scene. -Like Slade's previous film, HARD CANDY, it was shot beautifully. Several shots reminded me of paintings - stylish, morbid paintings. -One particularly impressive overhead shot carries you over a street of the town as vampires slay their prey in splashes of blood against the snow. -The beautiful ending (I won't give it away). I wasn't expecting to be moved as much as I was.<br/><br/>30 DAYS OF NIGHT was definitely worth seeing. I'll probably buy it when it comes out on DVD. It's safe to say that this is the most well-made vampire movie I've seen (although I haven't seen many). I have a feeling that it'll be ranked up there with the heavyweight hard- hitting survival horror films one day, such as DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE THING."
"Coventry","3","2","10","2 October 2008"," 30 Buckets of Fake Blood and CGI Splatter
","Around its time of release and another while after that, ""30 Days of Night"" was an extremely popular topic of conversation around Internet film forums and it also received quite a bit of media attention as well as favorable reviews from eminent critics. Now, barely a year later, nobody hardly even mentions it anymore; so I guess we're not dealing with an instant cult classic after all. Personally I wasn't in such a hurry to watch it on the big screen or even straight away when it came out on rental, because I'm not a big supporter of vampire movies and I'm definitely not too keen on computer-engineered splatter effects, which this large-budgeted movie was obviously stuffed with. But hey, allegedly this was the most original and innovating vampire movie in decades, with a noteworthy cast and mouth-watering gore effects, so if you're a fan of the genre you do have to see it sooner or later eventually. I'm the first to admit the rudimentary concept actually does have a lot of potential and actually is innovating! Vampires invading the most Northern little city in Alaska where the sun sets for 30 days straight? Awesome! How come nobody ever thought that before? It's so simple, yet so effective and rich in possibilities. The problem, however, is that director David Slade and his three-headed team of scriptwriters don't make proper use of even one third of all the great potential here! The opening sequences are still terrific, with a human ally of the vampires destroying all means of communication on the last day of sunlight in order to make sure there's absolutely no escape. The actual invasion is reasonably exciting as well, but it goes wrong immediately after that. Approximately 95% of the town's population gets exterminated during the first day of night, but are we then really supposed to believe that the handful of remaining survivors remain entrenched in an attic for 29 more days and with a posse of bloodthirsty vampires outside? After the virulent first half hour, director Slade hasn't got any script material left to work with and thus the story suddenly leaps from day 7 onto day 18 and forward to day 27, completely ruining the solely unique gimmick this movie has. Believe it or not, but once the vampires invaded the town of Barrow, ""30 Days of Night"" honestly turns into a largely dull and monotonous B-movie. The rest of the film is rather weak as well. The vampires easily rank amongst the least menacing ones I've ever seen. They wear cheap-looking suits (!), screech like teenage Goth-girls and speak in a ridiculous and sissy Romanian dialect. Especially the lead bloodsucker (Danny Huston) evokes more chuckles than frights, mainly because none of the things he says make any sense. The blood and gore effects might appear extreme and incredibly exciting if you're an overanxious horror-rookie, but they're not likely to impress anyone else. It's really just a whole lot of CGI splatter but in the end we don't even witness one half-decent moment of genuine carnage. Although he started out in the genre (with ""Halloween H²O"" and ""The Faculty""), Josh Hartnett now obviously feels too good to star in a horror flick and his performance is in proportion. Ben Foster depicts a terrific and genuinely uncanny character, but sadly his role is too brief. ""30 Days of Night"" isn't worth checking out but  like I said  you're going to end up watch it, anyway. Just do yourself a favor and keep your expectations low."
"Leofwine_draca","5","1","4","20 January 2013"," Good to see nasty vampires back, but it's a shame about the predictability
","Having heard plenty of good buzz about this vampire film, I sat down to watch the DVD with high expectations. I was left both satisfied and disappointed. Disappointed, because it in no way breaks any kind of new ground. Stylistically it's heavily indebted to THE THING, conjuring up the same kind of icy wasteland backdrop and eerie isolation that goes along with that.<br/><br/>The vampire action is gory indeed, full of arterial sprays and bloodied fangs, along with severed heads galore, but that's all stuff that's way old. This even reminded me of the BLADE films, especially the ending of the first Wesley Snipes movie and the ending of this one. Kudos to the filmmakers for bringing back vampires as they should be – feral, ferocious, and frightening – but other than that, 30 DAYS OF NIGHT is simply more of the same.<br/><br/>What it does have is an interesting cast. I usually dislike Josh Hartnett, but here he's given the chance to show warmth as the town sheriff who leads the fight back against the vampire menace. Melissa George is a lovely actress, and she shines as Hartnett's ex. The villains are led by a creepy Danny Huston and Ben Foster, delivering another of his psychopathic roles as the mysterious Stranger. The special effects are, for the most part, very good, with only the occasional lapse into cheesy CGI acting as a detriment.<br/><br/>The pacing is spot on and the segment where the characters are holed up inside a hidden antic is well handled, with plenty of suspense. But I didn't care much for the 'twist' ending, which made little sense, and other elements just seem to be thrown in to shock the viewer (the little-girl-vampire reminded me of the zombie baby in the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake: just there to be unpleasant). It's a fun throwaway film that doesn't outstay its welcome, but would I want to watch it again? I don't think so."
"MBunge","4","1","4","1 June 2010"," Not atrocious, but ends up in a corner and uses stupidity to get out.
","This movie is like a mechanism that gets all wound up but ultimately has nowhere to go.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night tells the story of a vampire attack on the town of Barrow, Alaska, a community so close to the North Pole that every year they have darkness that lasts for an entire month. Sounds pretty appealing to you average bloodsucker, right? Anyway, the story begins with town sheriff Eban (Josh Harnett) investigating weird events around town and yes, his name is Eban. Why you'd bother calling him Eban when it sounds exactly like Evan is a mystery for the ages. Satellite phones are stolen and destroyed. All the sled dogs in town are brutally slaughtered. A stranger (Ben Foster) turns up in town, looking like he just crawled out of a sewer and talking crazy. Eban, with an assist from his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George), throws the stranger in jail. But then the power goes out and the vampires blitz the town. These aren't your sexy, pensive, frilly shirt wearing vampires, though. These are simple, animalistic creatures who look at humans the way humans look at cheeseburgers. The vamps massacre most of the town with ease, but Eban, Stella and a small group manage to hide in the attic of an empty house, knowing they've got 30 days until sunrise. Not all of them will survive that longand those that do will pay a heavy price.<br/><br/>Though the story makes some weak allusions to psychological suspense when the surviving humans are all stuck together in the attic, 30 Days of Night is really just a more complicated way of jumping out from behind a corner and yelling ""Boo!"" This isn't a story that flows organically from human (or vampire) behavior and emotion. I t is a mechanism designed to put the characters in the greatest peril possible. But like some other mechanism movies, this one is so smart it has to become stupid in order to work.<br/><br/>These characters are trapped in sub-zero weather, with limited food and water and super-strong, super-fast, virtually unkillable monsters prowling around trying to find them. The only way they can survive is to hide, but doing that should kill them after just a few days of cold, hunger and thirst. I suppose you could make a movie of that, but it wouldn't be the commercial horror movie 30 Days of Night want to be. T his film wants to entertain, but it's trapped its characters in a dead end with no reasonable way out. So the movie does what many other movies do in this situation...it gets stupid. The practical realities of how this group of people could survive in this situation are ignored. And because the movie doesn't want to spend an hour and a half with these people just sitting around in the attic, they have to start doing idiotic stuff to get them out of the attic and into danger. But because they don't want the movie to end in 10 minutes, the stupid stuff they do doesn't kill them (unless the plot dictates it's time for a character to die).<br/><br/>And speaking of stupid, I have to point out than the vampires end up covered in blood from their attacks on the townspeople. Yet, even though they spend a month walking around Barrow at sub-freezing temperature, they never wipe the blood off and it always stays wet. I would think that even vampires would have some concern for their personal hygiene, but I'm absolutely sure that blood not only dries but also freezes in cold weather.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night also has the other weakness common to mechanism movies in that, none of the actions taken by the characters have any real meaning or depth to them. One of the things you can do to make these kinds of films more gripping is to link the physical challenges facing the character to emotional challenges from other parts of their lives. For example, Eban and Stella are separated, apparently over the question of having children. Not to spoil things for you, but Eban has to make a dramatic decision at the end of the movie to save everyone else. If they could have linked that decision to the separation it would have been a much more powerful moment. The problem between he and Stella should have been connected in some way to the problem he has to solve to save everyone, so there's an emotional significance to his actions beyond servicing the Almighty Plot Hammer. Or the film could have focused on how these people all came to this desolate place to get away from other people and be alone, but now they desperately need other people in order to survive. But after dancing around that theme for a few seconds, it's forgotten.<br/><br/>I haven't read the comic books upon which this movie is based (and yes, they're comic books and not a graphic novel, you pretentious bastards), so I don't know if the problems with this film come from the source or are the product of adaptation. If you're a vampire fan and are looking for a different take on the subject, you might enjoy 30 Days of Night. But you'd better be ready to go along with the story when it stops being clever and starts being stupid."
"freemantle_uk","5","1","4","26 February 2010"," A decent premise ruined by a weak script and acting
","Barrow, Alaska is one of the most northerly town in America, and in the middle of winter the town suffers from Polar Night, a month of darkness. Often most people leave the town and only a few diehards stay for the period. They is no way of leaving the town. On the last day of daylight the local sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) has to investigate some unusual crimes, including stolen mobile phones being burned and all the town sledge dogs being killed. Everything becomes clear when a group of vampires led by Marlowe (Danny Huston) and use the darkness as a chance for a feeding frenzy. A group of surviving, including Eben, his younger brother Jake (Mark Rendall) and estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) have to hide and survive the hunting vampires.<br/><br/>The premise for the film is good for a vampire film, a group of sadistic vampire isolate a small town and because of the polar night can do whatever their want. There are interesting ideas, like the survivors hiding like Anne Frank and her family, and the vampires avoid turning people by cutting off their heads. This are tough vampires with speed and strength and their own weakness is sunlight. The only other way to kill a vampire is cutting off their heads. But all these themes are no enough to save the film. Their is a weak script, with poor dialogue, lacking wit or realism. There is little character development, and many elements felt forced: like Eben's asthma and his relationship with Stella. People do also act stupid in a unrealistic fashion.<br/><br/>The other main problem is the cast. Only Danny Huston comes off as a interesting character, as a sadistic vampire willing to use violence and basically a tough mother. But the rest are just a bunch of bland actors. Josh Hartnett is a really boring actor and seems too young to be a sheriff and too much of a pretty boy for this type of role. The only role he has been good in was as The Man in Sin City. Ben Foster is another boring actor in the film and lacked the skill generally to be an actor. Melissa George is easy on the eye and generally a better actor to most of the cast, but she too was miscasted and unbelievable as a Fire Marshall for the area. The casting was poor for the film.<br/><br/>David Slade in my opinion is a fairly overrated director. His first film Hard Candy was overrated, with a lot of music video style camera tricks, and in 30 Days of Night there is no special shots, except for an aerial shot of the vampires attacking the towns people.<br/><br/>There is a good level of gore to keep die-hard horror fans happy, but for the rest of us you don't need to knock yourself out for this film."

","This movie was simply Over Hyped especially since it was based on a comic (following other successful adaptations), had a big blockbuster budget, good-decent actors; not to mention an interesting plot and yet the only good thing to it was the special fx. My issues with this film for starters was how these super vampires at the end got a pass for the majority by ""The One Who Fights"" Josh Hartnet after they just killed part of his family, friends, village and himself as well(since he had to turn himself into one); he simply lets them go!! Another gripe which I have with this movie is how throughout this entire movie a huge throw down is culminating with ""The Head Vampire aka Marlow"" and Josh Hartnet's character and yet it's wrapped up within a couple of minutes leaving a lot to be desired. Hell Mark Boone Junior's character ""Beau Brower"" at least went out like a soldier when it was his time... and all Josh Hartnet's character could muster was a that limp victory!! So disappointing!! <br/><br/>As for two possible goofs with this movie which seem to have gone unnoticed; 1). the fight at the plant involving Josh's character, his deputy and the vampire which I've dubbed ""The Bald Bastard"". During this fight scene ""The Bald Bastard"" has managed to wrestle the axe away from our hero and then he throws it at Josh's character missing him completely and hitting the railing and possibly falling off to the side and yet when the deputy has changed; Josh's character goes over to that same axe which is now placed on the floor near the railing and uses it to decapitate his former friend. The second possible goof (though I'm not completely positive); is that if that evil ""Bald Bastard"" is thrown into the mincer in that plant then who's the ""Bald Bastard"" at the end (were there two of them?? They looked the same)."

I wouldn't have signed onto this movie as the lead actor for a contract worth 50 million. Mainly because I would never work again if I did. But also because I have higher respect for myself than that. And if you have even the slightest amount of self respect you won't see this movie. You are paying to see a showcase of the same old crap."

","The beginning of this movie starts out alright, a few gimmicks here and there to put you on edge. But then the movie takes a turn for the worst, as we're introduced to Melissa, who is having relationship troubles with Hartnett's character. The drama between these two characters was completely mishandled throughout the film and made me want to puke. The vampire's looks were laughable at best, with the blood around their mouths just being too dull and just plain not scary. The action scenes were zoomed in too far and much too shaky, making it impossible to tell what's going on in them, which leads you to believe the director is trying to hide how bad the fight scenes really are."

","I'd never read the comics this film was based on, but it struck me as a somewhat intriguing idea... a group of vampires (i.e., monsters who can only hunt at night) discover perfect prey in a Alaskan town that endures a full month of night every year.<br/><br/>Sounds like a kinda clever premise for a horror movie, right? Well, it might have been, if 30 Days of Night had anything more than an remotely interesting premise to go on. The acting, script, set pieces, costumes, and special effects were all laughably bad. I should note that I'm a big fan of some really bad horror movies... but for a bad horror movie to be enjoyable, it has to avoid the cardinal sin of being boring. Not only was 30 Days laughably bad in just about all critical respects in which a movie can be bad, it was also painfully dull to watch. The characters were so poorly drawn there was no reason to care what happened to any of them, not the humans, not the vampires. It's hard to say who were more vapid or annoying, the humans or the vampires.<br/><br/>The humans suffered from stilted and silly dialog and bad acting, the vampires suffered from lousy makeup jobs (one of them looked like Trent Reznor in drag) and a ridiculous ""language"" (it sounded like they were speaking Klingon). Also, the plot never developed at all beyond ""there are baddies coming to get us""... no explanation as to where the vampires came from. Which might have been alright, if there had been any successful development of suspense or fear; but there was not. Just some pretty gory deaths, which in this day and age of ultra-violent horror movies, is just not enough to base a movie around by itself.<br/><br/>There were some funny bits, like the vampires Klingonesque dialect and silly appearance, and some rather enormous plot holes (planes can't fly in the dark, eh?). But unless you're just looking for something to play ""Mystery Science Theater"" with, stay away from this steaming piece of junk."

"shaneo632","5","1","4","27 November 2007"," A mildly efficient vampire film... (MILD spoilers)
","Shaun Munro's Reviews (ShaunMunro.co.uk):<br/><br/>David Slade's adaptation of Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith's cult series of horror comics is a curiosity, a film that is certainly uneven, but also a film that swings from cliché-riddled fare to moderately enjoyable shtick. The opening shots, which convey the epic setting of Alaska in the most alluring fashion, instantly remind one of John Carpenter's fantastic remake of The Thing, and provide the hope that Slade can make the most of the snow-kissed environment, just as Carpenter did twenty-five years ago.<br/><br/>It's simply unfortunate that the film is so fickle by its own nature - the protagonist, Eben Oleson (Harnett), is the morally unambiguous Sheriff of the Alaskan town in question, a man far too certain of his own prissy ideals to invite any interest whatsoever. It's not as though one is asking for an anti-hero character either, as that would be just as unsatisfying, but Harnett's character (as well as most of the other characters) lacks depth, and we never really get to know (and therefore empathise with) him. If the ""goody-two-shoes"" ploy wasn't repugnant enough, Harnett's rather alienating, uninspired acting only reflects how wooden his character is.<br/><br/>As a band of vampires descend upon the quaint town, 30 Days of Night becomes a tiresome exponent of horror film stock elements - the fake-out scares, the red herrings, the strained love story - it's all there in great, despicable abundance. To further ridicule the viewer, the trite love story is interspersed amongst the painfully-slow moving plot. Even as the first human is slaughtered by the vamps, viewers, and moreover, gore-hounds, are cheated out of any excitement through hackneyed editing and antagonists shrouded in darkness. Hell, Slade even threw the ""let's have the enemy pace past the foreground whilst our protagonist, in the background, fails to notice"" technique in there.<br/><br/>It isn't long before Ben Foster (simply credited as ""the stranger"") appears on the scene, and is, in a wildly preposterous scene, promptly arrested for attempting to order some fish, of all things. Regardless of how much Foster impressed in 3:10 to Yuma, he, and the lines he's given, are guffaw-inducing, and he even spouts a classic crazy-loon bad omen for good, cheesy measure.<br/><br/>Things eventually do get moving, and what Slade captures best perhaps is the sense of community among the residents of the town, although hasn't the time to dwell on it before the beasts begin slaughtering the town, again, rather frustratingly disguised by deceptive lighting and cinematography. That said, the score is appropriately loud and brash, and certainly adds to the erratic and frenetic atmosphere of the action scenes. As negative as this review appears, the film is full of subtle touches such as this, including deciding to have the vampires speak in their native tongue, subtitling their verbiage - it's something different, and it works.<br/><br/>Scenes of rancid dialogue and cutaway deaths fill a large portion of the middle of the film, accompanied by a largely disinteresting survival story that, when it's not tiresome, borders on ludicrous, such as our protagonist's encounter with an infected child. Furthermore, the film seems to take large leaps in its chronology, and before we know it, it's the eighteenth day of the thirty-day blackout, when I hadn't a clue that they'd moved past the third. Ah, yes, the most logical explanation is that this is a Grindhouse film and it's that dreaded missing reel gimmick again...No? Shucks.<br/><br/>One must return to Harnett's character - the man is a walking cliché - for instance, as another character seeks to take on the vampires in a last stand, Harnett prohibits him, insisting that he do it instead. Throw in a sacrificial death and one of the surviving members becoming infected and you've got what's nothing more than a bog-standard monster flick.<br/><br/>Only in the final third of the film does anything really hit home - the action pieces become more elaborate, and the violence more graphic. In fact, I felt genuine surprise and disgust as one poor individual had his neck dented in by an axe, with Slade down-right refusing to cut away.<br/><br/>As both sides prepare for their last stands amid a fire-fuelled finale, our heroes comes to the chilling realisation of the gravity of their situation, and both this, as well as the epic imagery of the fire and snow, is a nice hark back to Carpenter's aforementioned film. Naturally, the finesse of that film isn't present here, but it's not a bad attempt.<br/><br/>The real kicker for 30 Days of Night comes with its ending - in one sense, it's completely ridiculous, and will invite collective sighs among many cinema-goers. The subsequent payoff, however, is a smart, counter-Hollywood move that, as someone who hasn't read the comics, genuinely surprised and entertained me, and raised my opinion of the picture by a considerable amount.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night is a deeply flawed, unoriginal film, but manages to rectify a sizable portion of its foibles in the final third of the film. At first, the antagonists are cheaply cloaked from our view, their vicious attacks shown only in brief, yet as the film progresses, Slade ratchets both the action and graphic violence up, and despite the disinteresting and two-dimensional characters, delivers some surprises along the way. Slade's film does little to shake up the horror genre, but is purportedly faithful to the comics, and that should be enough for fans of both the source material and the genre in general."
"Chalice","5","1","4","21 November 2007"," Not a vampire movie
","The thing about vampires is that they're human monsters. The human part of them is what makes them more creepy, and attractive. I agree with a previous comment - these are more like fast moving zombies than vampires. They certainly devoured people more like zombies than vampires. The vampires in this film were just monsters, and not particularly scary either - they were a bit creepy, but their screeches were annoying and over-used. The made-up language wasn't the best idea either - what, you learn a new language when you get turned? Hm.<br/><br/>The human characters were pretty good, but there wasn't much depth to them so it was hard, I thought, to be that bothered when they were killed or turned. I also saw a lot of things coming in this movie, which is shocking because I hardly ever see things coming. As soon as that big grindy-choppy machine was shown, near the beginning, it was plain that someone, and/or part of someone was going to fall in to this at some point.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was exceedingly average, and I think it's going to disappear into cinema history without much of a trace. The reviews I've read claim that this is a 'genuinely chilling horror' and that the vampires are 'genuinely scary'. I disagree on both counts. Using the long nights of the poles was a good excuse for a movie though, almost surprised no one's thought of it before actually.<br/><br/>Chalice"
"anicol_99","6","1","4","30 October 2007"," Fails to meet potential
","The film 30 days of night is built around a sound and intriguing concept, yet it fails to live up to the potential that the basic idea creates.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett plays Eben Olsen a sheriff in the small Alaskan town of Barrow. Due to the co-ordinates of the town it falls into a spell every winter where the sun sets for 30 days and does not rise (hence the title). This makes for a very interesting premise, 30 days of night, vampires, bloodshed, should be good right? But from here on in the movie is mediocre at best. The film begins on the final day of light for the small town of Barrow with the towns folk going about preparation for the 30 days of darkness. The stranger (Ben Foster) arrives soon after on a ship off the outskirts of the small town and begins his trek into Barrow through knee deep snow. At this same time strange things begin happening around the town which put the sheriff on edge. The stranger then arrives and gets into a scuffle with Hartnett at a bar which consequently lands him in jail, where he threatens the station employees and sheriff with the unknown danger that is coming to their town. Power outages mixed amongst other things follow these warnings but he is not yet taken seriously. Up to this point the movie is still interesting and the suspense while still awaiting the first attack is sufficient to keep you interested, but shortly after when the first attack happens, the movie takes a turn for the worse.<br/><br/>The first attack is laughably bad. Hartnett discovers their victim and tells the townspeople to get to their homes and stay there until he tells them otherwise. The vampires arrive shortly after and all hell breaks loose. The movie shifts focus to a group of 7 or 8 people (including Hartnett) who hide out together and stays with them throughout the remainder. Despite this very little character development is made, a horror movie rarely has much character development i know, but there is ample time to do so. I found myself not caring who lived or died and at times not giving the movie my undivided attention.<br/><br/>I will end my review here as not to spoil the movie for those of you who are going to see it but my advice is this, the movie is mediocre so if you are interested in seeing it wait until it comes out on DVD."

","Now, i wont say it was bad.<br/><br/>I wont say it was good.<br/><br/>I will say that it was bloody, and gory and lottsa people died very bloody and gory deaths.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>First off, let's get one thing straight. it's a freaking vampire movie. if you can't get beyond that then you really have no business walking into the theatre.<br/><br/>So me and my wife didn't really go into this thinking that it was going to be some kinda epic story that had tons of character development.<br/><br/>At first thought we figured that aside from the obvious it was going to be a vampire movie that at the very least seemed to have a quasi original ideae. instead of the vampires having the weakness of always having be in bed during the day, they can now roam free and slaughter all day long cause in alaska once a year the sun doesn't shine for about 30 days.<br/><br/>... But then as the movie progressed something started to feel somewhat familiar... lottsa people getting slaughtered by blood thirsty undeads... always hiding out and huddling in the corners. keeping quiet so they cannot be found... scavenging the grocery store so in order to find food...<br/><br/>Wait a minute... this sounds a whole lot like 28 days later!!!! I totally understand that it is rather difficult to come up with an original idea nowadays, but at least having somewhat of a unique spin on it? The vampires looked like something out of a resident evil (the game) and one of them looked like jocelyn wildenstein. and i could have sworn that at some points they were speaking something that sounded a lot like klingonese (at least that's what it was originally called in trouble with tribbles...) The end like way to many movies nowadays was anti-climatic, and left me wanting. almost like the same feeling that you get when you eat Chinese takeout... what was the point? I could go on and on about the why not do this, or why not do that. but it would be quite pointless.<br/><br/>On the plus side, there were some new types of footage used here and there. and unlike like ""saw"" where they make it as gory and absurd as possible the carnage does have the ability to make one wince from time to time.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>In the end, my final thought while as the credits rolled was that blade could have taken care of the whole town in about ten minutes...<br/><br/>Selene could have done it in about 15, but only cause she's much more aesthetically pleasing on camera."

I will admit to being a newcomer to the horror audience (I have only seen Saw and 1408) but I know for a fact that this movie makes Manos: Hands of Fate look like 28 Days Later.The director must have been on smack when he made this because one scene showed a character talking OUT OF FOCUS and the vampires can be seen in plain view behind doomed chumps which makes the ""unseen stalkers"" lose their mystique. I think the movie was good up until the vampires had their first conversation with each other, which HUMANIZED them and made them lose ANY sense of coolness they might have had when they killed their first fat guy (the exception was when the bearded guy got into this chainsaw-truck thing and kicked the daylights out of the vampires although he should have died in the explosion he caused instead of getting his neck snapped by the Russian vampire ringleader.) And one more thing: Josh Hartnett CAN'T ACT!"
"harryplinkett14","1","1","5","9 October 2016"," Poorly made film
","Let's start with the title: '30 Days of Night'. Two problems arise instantly: 1. The idea that vampires use the 30-day period of darkness is not exploited in any kind of creative way. 2. The film supposedly takes place during the 30 days, but still feels like it takes place in one afternoon.<br/><br/>The characters here are dull, the antagonists are never developed and their motives and lifestyle remain obscure, it's never explained where the vampires come from or where they intend to go afterwards... The script just doesn't care one bit. There is even a character who is supposed to assist the vampires, but he is just taken out of the film before he can get a chance to do anything meaningful. Likewise, new characters are introduced at random, and the script has the audacity to expect us to care about them.<br/><br/>The whole film has an episodic character, jumping from scene to scene in a seemingly random fashion. I don't know whether to blame it on screenplay, direction, or editing. Probably all of the above. There is also a pervasive sense that the motivations of characters are weak and confusing at times.<br/><br/>Finally, the action scenes are disappointing. They are quite gory, but dull. Also, they are filmed with a shaky camera, often in closeups, and edited by a person with an attention span of one tenth of a second. The fight scenes therefore turn into a blurred mess where no one knows what's really going on. This confusion is also spatial, when it comes to action. Often times the characters split up, but one has no clue where they are in relation to each other or their destination. The whole film reeks of confusion.<br/><br/>One more thing: the film makes attempts at generating emotion, but fails miserably. The screenwriter seemed a lot more interested in ripping off other horror films and inserting every cliché imaginable, such as the zombie/vampire child, a member of the group who is bitten and transformed into a vampire without the rest knowing it, or the climax that takes place in a factory, with convenient grinding equipment used for mincing vampires.<br/><br/>On a positive note, the film does have scary moments, and it has vampires that look better than in many recent vampire films. But on the whole, it comes across as amateurish and unremarkable. No filmmaking talent spotted."

","This is certainly the worst vampire movie I've ever seen, and - bearing in mind the obviously slick production available, and quality cast - I'd say it comes pretty close to being the worst movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It totally lacks any sort of script or direction, and smacks of an attempt to cash in on the success of recent vampire shows, by someone who has presumably never seen a vampire show or movie.<br/><br/>Leaving aside the embarrassingly economical and forced dialogue and plot, the whole thing just looks wrong. The town looks like a set, the scenes are weak, and we have a lead vamp who is the spitting image of Neil Tennant (Pet Shop Boys) - anybody who knows Neil, knows he is not the most intimidating or pants-wettingly scary person in the world.<br/><br/>I have always thought highly of Josh Hartnett, but this performance is so bad - even allowing for the lack of suitable words for him to speak - that is barely recognizable as him.<br/><br/>Had I been forced to act in this movie, I think I would have thrown myself at the mercy of the Tennant monster. Those actors fortunate enough to die early on, were the lucky ones. Avoid a fate worse than being sucked dry by a camp vamp - avoid this movie."

"tdevereaux","3","1","5","24 May 2009"," Bad Movie
","I like the new take on vampires that this story has. And the setting is great. Unfortunately this movie didn't make use of either. I couldn't figure out if it was supposed to be a horror, a thriller, or just a movie where stuff happens. There is never a time where you feel in danger like any good horror movie should have. And you are never on the edge of your seat like a good thriller.You just wait to see what happens and hope there is more to it than just gore. And the gore isn't that good.<br/><br/>My other problem with this movie is the time-line. It is set in Alaska in a town that is above the line where night can last for over a month, hence the name. The problem is that there is no sense of time. The story plays out like it is a couple of hours, not days or weeks. No mention is made of how they survive for most of this time. 20 days pass with little more than a subtitle. Nothing is said about what has happened or why the vampires have seemed to have missed them. And apparently these vampires never wipe the blood off their faces, even after a month. There were just to many story problems like this.<br/><br/>It just came down to a good story told poorly. Suspension of disbelief has to be earned, and this movie did not earn it."

They hooked me, I was interested, but ended up being disappointed by the grab bag of clichés and lack of character development.<br/><br/>Although I did find myself to be tense from the suspense , I also found that I was tense from being annoyed as I watched. Fast jerking quick camera shakes during sudden violent scenes brought me to the conclusion that the Blair Witch camera man had developed an evolved case of Parkinsons and then landed a job shooting ""30 days of night."" This attempt at creating a mood of urgency and panic in the scene only succeeded in making me say, ""what the hell just happened?"" The acting coach also succeeded in creating the most annoying vampires in movie history. Their constant cry to one another was like being punched in the face with a dying cat. They also kill a bunch of dogs towards the beginning of the movie, but with knives? Some of what was going on just didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>I found it hard to keep track of who was who, probably because there were a lot of people and not a lot of development into who they were. All in all, it was a good attempt but too many factors made it unREwatchable. So if you have a poor attention span, don't mind bad explanations, and maybe even have a small case of ADD, then you've just figured out what to do for about 2 hours."
"drkallianc1","3","1","5","17 November 2008"," Good Idea, I Suppose, But Fails Miserably
","I accept the idea that 30 days of night would be heaven on earth for a vampire, that being said, it doesn't happen that way in any part of the world, it's not scientifically possible. However, even if I chose to ignore that major detail (which, quite honestly, I did for the sake of enjoying the film) there were just too many problems with this movie for it to actually be anything more than barely watchable.<br/><br/>First of all, the violence got choppy (and I mean really really choppy), so much so that I could barely tell what was going on when it probably would've been really cool to see. It's almost as if they couldn't hold their camera man was ADD or the camera was too heavy for him or something. It simply got really annoying really quickly.<br/><br/>Second, I absolutely hate it when characters know way more than they should. For instance (and this isn't a spoiler because it's true with all vampire myths, except when you talk about that piece of trash book Twilight, but that's not important) how the hell do they know that the vampires don't like sunlight? They ""explain"" their reasoning, but it's such a stretch that within two seconds I came up with a million other, more plausible reasons for their ""explanation"" besides that they don't like the sun. I know that they could have come up with a better way of telling us that.<br/><br/>Third I'll compile my issues with the vampires themselves (since there are only two) when the vampires attack someone it's like their having a freaking seizure. They keep flailing their heads around, it actually looks really funny and I had to keep from laughing, which is not good when your supposed to be scared by them. My other issue with the vamps, one minute they seem like intelligent hunters, the next they seem like mindless killing machines, back to intelligent hunters, mindless... intelligent... mindless... they switch back n' forth so much I could never quite wrap my head around what I supposed to think about them! Fourth and finally (without going into spoilers that is) I watched this movie expecting a frightening horror movie... it wasn't scary, and it can only be classified as horror for a few short seconds (and anything with vampires has to be horror). For the most part, it was a slow romp through the snow here, and some gory action there... I would classify it more as drama or action than horror.<br/><br/>However, the look and feel of the film was good, I liked the art style a lot, so I was really hoping it was going to be good, and the story was not all that bad, enough plot holes to bug me, but I expect a few here and there... but it wasn't good, and it takes a lot more than an amazing art style and over the top gore to impress me (a matter of fact, over the top gore bugs me, I like realistic gore, that's always fun, but too much just gets way to in your face and distracts from the film itself)."

","Originally a couple of my roommates told me not to watch this movie as it was very stupid and not worth it. So for the last 6 months I have given little thought to this title, until it appeared for free on my cable box. I thought that perhaps they were idiots so I decided to watch it anyway. Big mistake. This move is absolutely terrible. For the first 40 minutes Josh Hartnett rides around as the sheriff of an Alaskan town and doesn't seem to notice the people getting their throats ripped out. After that, a group of survivors drives around in loud vehicles and somehow the vampires don't notice, regardless of the fact that they can ""smell your blood."" Apparently the vampires plan is to continuously attack towns along this pipeline and then poke holes in the oil pipe and light it on fire and the rest of the United States will think that it is just some silly coincidence. I mean come on, really? Like after four towns of people disappear from tiny holes poked into a pipeline no one will notice? It seriously does suck... it is just like one of those old horror films that is cheesy and you still like, but you don't like this one and its serious."

","A dark period is about to start for a small village in Alaska. This isn't entirely strange as the town is located so far to the North there's a yearly recurring period of ""eternal night"". In this period most inhabitants of the town skip town because they don't want to be plagued by the long lasting darkness and the nasty effects that has on people.<br/><br/>As the local sheriff and an accompanying officer ride around the town to do a final check up they find something odd: a pile of burned satellite telephones. As the investigation continues it turns out to be the start of something much more sinister. And so it starts. The remaining citizens of the town will soon find out that going somewhere else had been a better option. It doesn't take long before the sun goes down and the trouble starts.<br/><br/>So far the story. Personally I love a good horror film and I love films where people get mangled for whatever reason. If there's a good streak of tension to it, all the better. If there's a bit of imaginative and new monster building to it, even better. Quite sadly, none of those are present in this film. Tension is non-available as the characters are played out so much using all the known monster film clichés out there that one can point out the next one to die about a second after the character comes into play. Imaginative monster design is out of the question too: the monsters are pretty much the same as the ones seen in many many more films. The one thing that the film does have is people getting mangled in a good way. Most of the kills are pretty vile and worked out nicely.<br/><br/>All added together though it leaves a sad impression.

The vampires were ridiculous, made stupid faces, and just seemed unrealistic and generic. Josh H. and the rest of the cast does a very mediocre acting job, and the script is tedious and unprovocative. The characters reactions to their surroundings just seemed unrealistic.

","I grew up watching really olde English vampire movies, typically featuring buxom actresses in flowing white gowns and Christopher Lee swanning around in a big Dracula cape. So, I have a pretty romantic/sexual picture of vampires in my head.<br/><br/>Contemporary vampires, of the sort you get in this movie, strike me as too demonic, sexless and savage. These new vamps just rip people limb from limb instead of trying to seduce them. Where's the fun in that? If showing disgusting gore is the whole point, then why not just make a werewolf or zombie movie instead? <br/><br/>Right, rant over. Once I accepted that the vampires in ""30 Days of Night"" would be gross, I actually enjoyed the movie somewhat. The snowbound setting is really eerie and cool, and the directing is pretty good for a modern horror movie. Even Josh Harnett manages to be likable, and the main vampire has an occasional interesting line.<br/><br/>I never fully bought into the main premise of the movie -- namely, that a rag-tag band of characters could successfully hide from a swarm of vampires for a whole month. The vampires start off seeming really powerful and clever, but they must take their stupid pills afterwards because they don't even think to search the general store for human survivors. I mean, come on, where else are people gonna hide? All the supplies are there.<br/><br/>But despite the grossness, and the odd lapse in logic, I enjoyed this movie. I got a few good scares out of it.

For instance the vampires spoke a language that no one knew what it was. They were not scary. They really didn't show them killing the people. There wasn't enough of a chase or a challenge.

The let down was the cast, in particular Mr Hartnett. He gave a mediocre performance and was not at all convincing as the hero. Perhaps a different casting would have seemed better to me, but as it was, the film will continue in my eyes as an OK attempt at a modern vampire movie.

"Antagonisten","3","1","6","29 July 2008"," A good idea wasted
","I don't even know why i watch vampire-movies any more. The genre has become a marsh-land of mediocrity. But i guess i liked the premise of this movie. Living in the north myself i can relate to long and dark winters, and how this would actually benefit the vampire (if he or she can stand the cold that comes with it).<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie is undoubtedly the fact that they wasted the whole premise completely. First of all they have no idea how winters in the north work. Here it's: one day there is regular sunlight, daylight for hours. The Next day it's complete blackness that goes on for thirty days. Doesn't that strike people as odd. They would have had almost no sunlight at all for a long time before it turns into complete darkness. Well, whatever. That's a minor point, even if it does make the plot a lot more nonsensical.<br/><br/>A larger part of the problem is that they haven't done anything fun with the darkness. There is no skulking vampires, no regular town getting picked off one by one while life tries to go on. Rather this is a sudden slaughter and then humans skulking around. Without revealing too much i have to say that i would have preferred the other way around. After all the vampires come there to have a steady food supply over the winter while being able to walk around 24 hours a day. Basically that's not what happens.<br/><br/>So, i liked the premise but not the execution. What of the other qualities of the movie? Special effects? Actors. Well, the effects are decent enough for the most part although it's nothing you haven't seen about a million times already. Vampires are pale with bad teeth, walking around wheezing and growling for no reason. The heroes are Mr goody two-shoes (Josh Hartnett) and a motley crew of not too interesting townsfolk. And of course there is the always-present ex-wife/girlfriend with a pretty face.<br/><br/>Honestly, this movie bored me. There is a lot more finesse required for the vampire genre to do it for me. And if not finesse then maybe a sense of humor or good action scenes. What we have here is basically a long wait for something to happen. And when it finally does, it's less than exciting. I actually found myself preferring the Blade-movies to this one. At least there something happens and the vampires are menacing in an entertaining way. This is mostly just a good idea completely wasted. I rate this 3/10."

Where have the vampyres been before coming to this Alaskan town to feed ? Why haven't the vampyres been to this Alaskan town before as its a perfect feeding ground for them ?

So we have a film where a big metal boat turns up full of vampyres who proceed to kill everything they can in the Alaskan town and you don't learn anything about them what so ever (other than they hate God and don't believe in him). Then they suddenly vanish again and its story over ? Anyone could have written this screenplay.<br/><br/>30 Days of Night had huge potential but was just too jumpy and had no real depth in the characters apart from the two main heroes.

","After watching this so called great horror movie and reading the last users comment, i thought it was only fair that i had my say! To the user before me: HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A HORROR MOVIE?!! I believe not. As if they had watched even a half decent horror, they would have realised after the first 10 minutes, that this was going to be a shockingly bad attempt at a vampire movie!!<br/><br/>First off i would like to congratulate the creators of the so called ""vampires""! To me they were nothing more than the zombies that were created for Will Smith's I Am Legend movie, the only difference is that they had pointed teeth and nails and less of a personality! Even though this movie was out before I Am Legend, to me that doesn't matter as the similarities are too close for comfort, and at least I Am Legend goes gives you some explanation as to why they are like that! <br/><br/>They also have there own unique demonic language which they, and they alone can understand! So you would think that if a normal human was to be turned into a vampire then not only would the physical characteristics change, so would there vocabulary? Well not in this case!<br/><br/>Also i would have liked a bit more background on why, where, when, and what the vampires want. Yes i know that there on a killing spree and yes it is a gore fest but does that really make it a good, oh no sorry, ""Brilliant"" horror? I think not! <br/><br/>The story is far too weak to hold your attention for long and after 20 minutes i actually turned it off as i couldn't bear another second of watching this pitiful attempt of a vampire movie! So i thought id go on to IMDb and see wot it was giving as a rating! Thats where i read the last comment and said to myself that i will have to sit through it as i wanted to know if this user had actually watched the same movie as me or they had got muddled up with a classic, or even if they were on drugs! i think it could be the latter as that has to be the worst ever vampire movie ever, and i mean ever made!!<br/><br/>I would recommend that everyone should rent a copy and then set fire to it so as to stop future generations having to sit through 1 hour 53 minutes of pure, unadulterated garbage! <br/><br/>And a wee parting gift for the user who's comment I read!

And with the time skip, as mentioned by other users on IMDb, many plot holes/inconsistencies arise. As far as horror goes, the gore level was decent, but there just wasn't enough tension or suspense that really built it up, thus if this movie wanted to redeem itself for cult value, it should have upped the graphic violence. watch it once, at home. if your a fan of the comic, my bet is you'd buy the graphic novels before you'd buy the DVD, unless you have nowhere to spend your money. the film is good for a date, where you don't need to pay attention to get the story and you can multitask before glancing at some action scenes."

Also, it feels like there was a lot of stuff left on the cutting room floor.

Jake oleson played by mark rendall also delivers a fine performance and Ben foster is just plain creepy as the stranger. This film had a decent amount of action in it, but i really would have liked to see a little more added. A few more fight scenes between the main characters and the vampires seem almost necessary.

It would have been better, cut down to about an hour and a half.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the vampires were more rugged, physically powerful and far more agile than those in most other movies of its genre - these guys certainly were nothing like the suave Count Dracula portrayed by Bela Lugosi. Their leader spoke a foreign language (subtitled in English) that sounded more like Klingon than any earthly language.<br/><br/>Perhaps my view of the movie was based on more than five decades of watching various horror films of all types.

","The premise is cool: A remote Alaskan town has 30 days without any sunlight - '30 Days of Night.' A group of vampires come to town to take advantage of this. Eventually, we follow a small group of survivors as they try and stay alive until the 30 days are up. However, the cool premise is taken away by the fact that the filmmakers have no idea how to handle it. It may as well have been called '3 or 4 Days of Night' since we keep lurching forward in time with hardly anything changing for any of the characters.<br/><br/>The film is bad because it simply has its priorities wrong. Its main priorities are: sick gore (a blunt axe takes about 6 swings to chop a head off), and people hiding from the vampires. What it isn't concerned with: people battling vampires to stay alive. The vampires are cool, no question. They dress in dark clothing, look fantastically warped, screech and speak a strange language. The main problem is that they are so much stronger than the humans. The vampires can do anything. Watch them stop speeding cars, run faster than the eye can see, take bullets and keep on coming .... therefore, any confrontation with the humans can only end one way - with the humans being overwhelmed and killed as brutally and bloodily as possible. So the main action of the film is hiding from the vampires, and trying to avoid them until the 30 days are up, rather than trying to take them down.<br/><br/>These problems along with a complete lack of logic by the characters sink the film. This is best summed up when about 3/4 of the way into the film, a character leads all the vampires to a house, where he grabs an inspired weapon to use against them. The weapon works beautifully and then he doesn't even try to use it again!!! On top of this, people hide out for days and nobody needs to eat so much as a sandwich. 6 people dash through the streets to another location with one axe between them. Nobody even thinks to grab a plank of wood or even a frying pan? I know horror-film characters make dumb decisions but that's only good when its part of the fun. This film seems all too willing to just throw out consistency and common sense whenever it is mildly convenient or for no reason whatsoever.<br/><br/>'30 Days of Night' - Its a Very Long Period.

Moreover, I found almost no logic in the actions of the ""heroes"" and even less in the doings of the vampires. While watching, many times I asked myself the question ""Why did he do THAT?"" or ""Why did he go there?"" and my favorite ""When the hell did THEY get separated??"" Unfortunately, I couldn't find an answer to the questions. I also think that many other movies (""Dawn of the Dead"" for example) made quite a better job of portraying the passing time in the movie and also what happened through the time the viewers missed. Quite disappointing for me were also the ""vampire only"" scenes, in which I only saw a wasted potential for a good plot. In my opinion, the ""scary scenes"" were the biggest disappointment. I wasn't satisfied with their amount, intensity and even gore levels. What a waste! The only thing that I liked in the entire movie was its ending. And by ending, I mean only the last 3 or 4 minutes.

There are some realistic gore scenes in war movies like Saving Private Ryan, and my stomach barely growled.<br/><br/>So why in the first time in my years of horror movie watching was I about ready to run out of the theater and vomit? Because no movie should be THIS gory.<br/><br/>There are some rules in cinema, and this movie crosses those lines. (I won't say what to not ruin the story) If you like gore (and I mean borderline psychopath level blood-lust for gore) and you like horror movies that push the envelope, that's fine. There were people in the audience that showed glee from all the gore. But there were at least three other people that walked out of this movie sickened.<br/><br/>But aside from the gore, this movie is filled with cliché's. You know if you've seen horror films who will die and who will survive. They fight off the vampires the same damn way they always do. And throw in a little paranoid person who endangers the group and you have another processed vampire flick.<br/><br/>Vampire's saying there is no God, being gentle then killing brutally. It's all there.<br/><br/>Save yourself a couple of bucks, don't see this movie unless you need to stave off the blood lust a little longer. Or if you secretly wish to view a massacre of over a hundred innocent people screaming for their lives. I wouldn't recommend this at all."
"tapples01","2","1","7","27 October 2007"," Possibly the worst vampire movie ever made
","I'm not really sure why people are giving this 7-10 stars. This is the worst vampire movie I have ever seen. The acting was awful, which was surprising because of how good Josh Hartnett's performance was in Lucky Number Slevin. It makes me think that no actor could perform well with the lines he was given in this movie. The script was really cheesy and cliché. The movie did have a couple of scary parts, but those were just the type where it gets quiet and a loud noise makes everyone jump. The vampires in this movie were clearly a rip off of the zombies in 28 days/weeks later. They weren't scary, just ugly and annoying (all they do is scream the whole time). There was one good character in this film, called the stranger, but after like 15 minutes of build up with him he never does anything. That pretty much describes the movie though. You always feel like something exciting is going to happen--something to take you away from the misery of the acting and dialogue, but it never does. I gave this 2 stars because I didn't walk out on it; probably would have and jumped to another movie if this wasn't the last showing and another movie was starting about 30 minutes later. I would not recommend even bothering with this movie, spend the money and time on something better."

Many things were left unsolved(hopefully not as an intend to make the second one), some things were really stupid. The worst part is that it is about some kind of vampires(they didn't say that they are vampires on the other hand) and these vampires are spitting blood from victims all over the place.

"smkroh","3","0","4","4 October 2019"," All hat, no cattle
","I have been wanting to see this ever since it was released, struck by its intriguing premise. Fast forward 12 years and I finally do, only to find out it's a hollow mess.<br/><br/>First, there's no context. You never find out where the vampire clan came from or what they are trying to achieve. They speak (rarely) in guttural subtitled quips, you never know their names, and other than the leader, you can barely tell them apart except that they fall into categories like Bald Vampires, Skinny Brunettes, and so on. What do they do for the other 11 months of the year? How did they become vampires? The movie doesn't care.<br/><br/>Second, there's no internal logic after the villains show up. They slaughter everyone, but so violently and swiftly that you have to wonder if they even get a decent meal. Once the whole town is dead except for a few hidden stragglers, why do they stay around for another 3-4 weeks? They don't seem to be founding a vampire colony or trying to take over the arctic world. In fact, their leader explicitly commands them not to turn any of the townspeople into new vampires. Once again, no reason for this is offered.<br/><br/>Whenever a human ventures outside, the whole vampire clan just seems to be standing around in a loose clump in the streets, waiting (like the viewer) for something to happen. The whole movie would make more sense if the action played out over a few days of hunt/kill/hide high tension, but the conceit of using up the whole ""30 days of night"" forces the story to just go into mothballs until something decides to happen.<br/><br/>Why do we have to believe that our heroes can live in an attic for two weeks with no food or water, afraid to even sneak downstairs and use the bathroom? Then they raid a grocery store and hide out in the police station for another two weeks. The vampires with supernatural hearing and smell, scouring the town for survivors, never find them in either place until they try to move on.<br/><br/>Toward the end of the 30 days, the sheriff sees a signal from his deputy's house and goes to investigate. When he comes back, the survivors he left behind have relocated to the town power plant/sewage plant/whatever the heck a ""utilidor"" is supposed to be--sure, they had been talking about trying to fortify themselves there from the beginning, but why pick up and go without telling him or asking him? Because ""Oooo, they all disappeared, TENSION!"" Except he immediately guesses where they went and he's right, so no that much tension.<br/><br/>Then the leader decides it's time to burn the town down and move on, because the sun is about to come back. To save his estranged wife from burning to death, our hero injects himself with vampire blood and goes to fight the vampires on their own terms. Still pretty bad odds, but he wants to provide a diversion so she can escape. No worries--for no particular reason, it turns into a one-on-one duel between him and the head vampire. The whole clan just stand around and watch until the sheriff uses his new strength to punch through the guy's skull and rip out his brain. The leader doesn't say, back off, I'll handle this myself or any of that typical swaggering plot device, it just plays out as if he had.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the other vampires disappear and he goes to watch the sunrise and die in his wife's arms. You are left to assume that the vampires sensed the sunrise approaching and left, but no time is spent establishing this. Did one of them become the new leader? Does he have any idea what they should do next? Did they all get caught in the sunrise and die? Who knows?<br/><br/>The vampires speak in a foreign language. Is it Russian, because they came over the pole from Siberia? Is it Slavic because they trace their roots back to Transylvania? I found after the fact that the filmmakers invented a crude ""vampire language"" just to make them more mysterious and unearthly, and remove any chance for nuance or mutual understanding in the process. Even translated with subtitles, the leader's faux-profound aphorisms are dreck that adds nothing to the story. And that sums up the problem with this movie--all concept, no execution; all style, no substance; all plot, no logic. All hat, no cattle. What a disappointment after such a long wait."

"paddy-2","3","0","3","26 November 2016"," Does not deliver on its premise
","I wanted to like it, I really did. But here's the thing - the real Barrow is 60% Native Alaskan. Yet, if you watched this film, you'd think it was 95% Caucasian. There's a couple of token glimpses of Inupiat kids near the start, and there's one character who's allowed to loiter in the background til he gets his head chopped off with an axe. But this is a film with no interest in what life in an Arctic community is really like. <br/><br/>Which - racism aside - might be fine in a stylised genre movie, if the coolness of the basic premise was delivered on. But it isn't. <br/><br/>Barrow - isolated on the far northern edge of Alaska, with a month of sunless darkness - is attacked by vampires! Sounds great, but the trouble is, there is very little sense of landscape, the barren midnight wastes from which attack might come. Everything looks like a back lot or a digital set extension, apart from a couple of location scenes. The story has no interest in where the vampires came from or why they are here. <br/><br/>And I got no feeling for the life of the town before or during the attack. The little people are disposed of during one long aerial shot of vampire carnage. What remains are just a couple of white cops, and some other similar people whose main job is to exchange scared looks. I kept wishing the denouement of the film would be when a bunch of hard-as-nails Inupiat stormed out of their houses and saved the cast, but no such luck.<br/><br/>And as for the 'darkness' bit - the whole film looks like it is enacted under supermarket strip lights. Is that moonlight? Why are the town's streets so brightly lit, when the sky is shown as midnight black and cloudy? Why, in an abandoned house, with the windows boarded up and the power cut, is everything as bright as day? I sense the dead hand of some exec here telling the DP and the colourist to brighten everything up. Which was the worst decision possible. Fear of the dark is possibly the strongest human fear. But this film should've been called '30 Days (or was it 3?) of Over-Lighting'."
"mymtproject","4","0","3","23 November 2016"," The vampires were cool but everything else was silly
","30 DAYS OF NIGHT had gruesome and violent vampires only interested in feeding to their fill on the townspeople of Barrow, Alaska.<br/><br/>That's the best part of the movie. The rest is, shall we say, very silly! First off, Barrow, Alaska looks like some old Western town with storefronts like Saloons or General Stores, only missing hitching posts outside. If you've ever seen actual photos of Barrow, you would notice that most every dwelling is a dome shaped abode or mobile home. Very few houses look like the ones in the movie. Nearly everyone in the Barrow of the movie is Caucasian, another inconsistency with a town that is not only real but primarily populated by Inuit peoples (Eskimos for the layman). The main hero and heroine are both typical, overly attractive people that look totally out of place in an area as rough as Barrow. They look like they just walked out of Macy's in Denver. Both are mostly uninteresting characters who you aren't empathetic with in the least. I was watching and rooting for the vampires to obliterate the town and all it's phony Alaskans, then sail away into the night on their big ship. For me, that would have been a happy ending to this lame movie. Guess you can tell I didn't like it that much, huh? It's a 4 out of 10 and ONLY because the vampires were cool."

","As is often the case, the technical aspects like the cinematography and the production design are not what filmmakers goof up. It's the script, the direction, the handling of the tone, the decisions that are made when it comes to what the movie is supposed to do and convey where they drop the ball. This movie, isn't a complete failure in that sense. But it did make me scratch my head sometimes.<br/><br/>So the premise is great. It's a great idea for a movie. A great setting in which you can have a story take place which is... Well, what exactly? Thrilling? Thought provoking? Perhaps a story that makes a statement? I suppose you could go into various directions with it.<br/><br/>So what direction did this movie take it in then? Well, there's one death scene which is very reminiscent of a so-called ""fatality"" in Mortal Kombat where a vampire falls into a machine. I think the audience is meant to react in a similar way to it where they cringe and then perhaps laugh. So it isn't anything serious. It's just meant to be entertaining.<br/><br/>At the same time in that same scene a man who shot his wife and children because he didn't want them to die at the hands of the vampire horde loses part of his arm when it gets crushed in the machine and he's sitting there screaming in complete agony. A friend then decides to end his suffering by cutting his head off which requires two or three blows with an axe. It's tragic and bleak and not meant to be entertaining in any way.<br/><br/>I think that it would have been a more poignant movie if it for instance just told a dark story and didn't ""spice it up"" with scenes that are seemingly meant to please so-called ""gorehounds"". It seems to me that they tried to make two different types of horror movies at once resulting in a movie which feels slightly incongruous as a whole. I'm confused as to what the film exactly is trying to do and say at the end of the day.<br/><br/>The ending is great. It made a powerful impact. It's like it's the ending of a serious horror movie and it works very well. But in this movie there also seems to be a Pepsi commercial. Is there really a place for that in a serious film? Just seems kind of out of place?"

Any way the town of Barrow, Alaska is isolated by vampires as it is about to go through the polar night of thirty days. Hence the title me thinks. So after almost all the townspeople are slaughtered by the blood suckers the sheriff accidentally finds out they can be killed by chopping the head off. They also figure out that a sun lamp works. I did not see any one try the old religious standbys of holy water, cross, bible, etc. The few remaining townies are picked off one by one by circumstances and the vamps. In the end the vampires are burning the whole town so there will be no survivors to tell people they really exist. To try and save the few remaining humans which includes is estranged wife the sheriff turns him self, goes out to the vampires and fights the leader. Killing it by driving his hand through its head. The remaining ones trudge of into the dark set, the sheriff greets the returning sun with his wife. Of course he fries. I guess they let the other vampires go hoping for a sequel. I hope not."

"richy1024","6","0","1","3 October 2012"," Bloody encounter is violent revelation of the Vamp.
","This is a very stylish encounter, film committees have revised the history of the vampire from days of silhouette filming, throughout film noir and constantly reviewing the innovative alterations of the parasite ever since. Adapted from Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith's graphic novel comes perhaps the most enhanced and startling vampires to date. Even surpassing the malicious Frostbiten as possibly the most cruel and ferocious nightmare to date. 30 Days of Night is based on the factual nature of Barrow, Alaska, falling to thirty days of unreserved gloom, but with the visit of a few uninvited fictionalised guests. Although the narrative is as simple as watching meat fall off the bone this service does not offer any smiles. No knife and forks and no table reservations are made whilst this tribe are in town. This is a tale that follows the survival of the fittest, led by Josh Harnett and Melissa George, against the most enhanced bloodsuckers to date, in the wilderness whereby the cold feeling isn't the artic ambiance, its death approaching.<br/><br/>These vampires, led by chief vamp Marlow (Danny Huston) can be labelled as heartless, menacing monsters; moreover these creatures lack distinct levels of emotion. Marlow's mob escort themselves with idiosyncratic shrieks, at scintillating speeds. These spongers offer no radiance, they are carcasses with extremely pale skin who stick around like leeches nourishing off every living essence until every last drop has been inebriated dry. It is remarkable, however that these foreign exports choose to haunt the fields of derelict ice sheets where the meat is rare and civilian blood is bitter. Common logic would propose to lope around the streets of boarders beyond the glacial landscape of Alaska and venture into the metropolis. But as the narrative would suggest, a second instalment is likely to be on the cards due to Niles and Templesmith's fictional continuation. One would only imagine these insects to whisk on from the wintry wasteland and vanquishing in city depths for feeble fresh meat.<br/><br/>There is a discrete affiliation that the nation has with the vampire, a careless one actually. They are predictable, sometimes temperamental but an addictive creation. They are our departed cousins and instrumental body, demonstrating how life could be if other forms of meat and vegetation were not so widely obtainable in the common market for us to consume. Fans of revulsion and visceral photography will be in their element. The crimson is rich, sending shudders of emotion down your spine. The cinematography is sharp and its presentation is also rather conceivable. Some will uncover Slade's motion picture as unnecessary and lacklustre, but as always it's a virtue of taste. Romantic comedy aficionados will not endure passion from this love bite fest."

","Its well known that if you want to heal your failing relationship being hunted by vampires is the way to do it.

You could say it is more realistic than usual but who wants that. Dog Soldiers was better. If you break with the conventions you have to find something better as a replacement. The plot is essentially a cat and mouse game with the humans doing all the ridiculous things people would not do like running around outside of safety. <br/><br/>Also there is no real origin for the vampires. Good old Count Dracula antecedents are well known and of impeccable credentials. They have no class either, just nastiness. Just mindless monsters which the classical master vampire never was.<br/><br/>Not a film I would ever want to watch again. The Thing is essentially the same cat and mouse type plot but so much better. So all in all just another unpleasant horror movie with nothing whatsoever to say about anything. Totally unedifying."

","The overall concept is... a concept, at any rate but is probably over thought. Okay, people are besieged by vampires for weeks. Vampires that aren't terribly active. Actually, had they been more active they likely would've needed one night.<br/><br/>If not being scary automatically meant bad, I'd be writing off around 99% of horror as bad, including some I really like; therefore I wouldn't consider that a serious flaw. That said, this would have worked better using the suspense of people trying to remain hidden; it never seemed like these vampires were terribly concerned with finding the survivors.<br/><br/>Like ""Stakeland"", too much action renders building decent atmosphere difficult, made worse because the action is often incoherent. The characters don't provide much reason for audience members to invest in their survival either."
"deacon_blues-3","7","0","1","13 November 2010"," Best Vampire film since Nosferatu (1922)
","This film avoids the clichés of most vamp films: Romantic vampires, nubile débutantes who want to become vampires, debunked vampires who live in sunlight, the good vampire, who is only misunderstood and can't help himself, vampirism as a disease that can be cured, etc. I am soooooooooooooo sick of that garbage I could puke! These suckers is EVIL! To the bone! But there is not much of the supernatural aspects either: transformation, holy water, crosses, etc. So it is a truncated legend. If you're going to have a film about vampires, why not do the whole thing up right and make the most of it? Why must we always de-mythologize the legend and re-fit it with pseudo-scientific trappings or make the whole story about love or sex? A Vampire is a demon-possessed corpse that feeds on the blood of the living. It is an abomination, and an offense to God and all that is normal and good in creation. It defies scientific analysis because it is a spiritually-powered idea. That's what makes it interesting and scary. Steve King understood that when he wrote 'Salem's Lot. Bram Stoker understood that when he wrote Dracula, and made it a Christian epic about the battle between good and evil. If horror film directors want to stop making crap, they should stick to the historic legends, and leave the romance, sex, science, new age religion, diseases, and etc. to other genres. This one comes close. Good suspense, acting, and atmosphere."

Why not just wait out all 30 days in their hidey hole? 4. Lastly, why does being a vampire automatically mean you have no concept of personal hygiene? They could at least wipe their faces. Or would that make them too difficult to distinguish from the humans?<br/><br/>That aside, Melissa George is pretty hot, even if she looks a bit like a rabbit. But not even that can save this ridiculous film."
"Blekkhart","7","0","2","11 October 2010"," Beautiful cinematography filled with sadistic visions
","I watched this movie with my girlfriend. She is a big fan of Twilight and has romantic ideas about vampires. By the end she was so disgusted she had to walk away. This tells you what you need to know about 30 days of night. It's portrayal of vampires is far from the teenage romantic vision offered in Twilight. This movie is dark, cold, sadistic and bloody. There is nothing romantic about ripping someones neck apart and letting them bleed to death. Anyone who wants to be a vampire based on having seen Twilight, should watch this movie first to make sure they really want what they wish for (be careful what you wish for because it might come true). All in all I think this movie is an above average vampire movie. It is beautiful and atmospheric with interesting and believable characters, and not so ridiculous, posed, stylized and shallow like many other horror movies nowadays. It actually has some substance underneath all the gloss. I just wish the ending had been more intelligent, surprising and thought provoking. I like those movies with a twist in the end that makes your gut churn, like The Mist. If this movie had stepped up that extra notch towards the end, it would have been truly great."

"johneco","2","0","5","15 July 2010"," I love horror - I hated this
","First off, let me say I'm a fan of horror. I love Sam Raimi's horror work (e.g. Evil Dead), so I was excited when I saw he was a producer. I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane, just a good horror movie. Most of the reviews I saw here led me to believe that's what I'd get, and I'm writing this because I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>There were some positives. I liked the premise: gang of vampires attacks a town that has 30 days of night due to being in Northern Alaska. I liked the depiction of the vampires as blood soaked and gruesome, instead of some kind of goth vampire glam boys (although it got kinda old the 20th time it showed the same scene of them laughing evilly with their faces covered in blood, and they were kind of clichéd and 2D themselves with their overcoats and nosferatu nails). And there were some beautiful and haunting wide angle shots: the dead ship docked in the ice; the overhead of the vampires going berserk on the town.<br/><br/>Where the movie failed horribly for me was in the most basic task of a movie: telling a story and engaging the viewer. First of all the sound engineer should be shot - I had to turn the volume on my system up to 70 to hear what the characters were saying (they're whispering for 2/3 of the movie), but then during the action scenes when the vampires were screeching I'd have to turn it down to 30 to keep from getting the police called on me. I literally had to keep doing this all through the movie, every minute. Then there were crazy continuity and logic errors throughout. One minute a guy is blowing himself and vampires up, the next minute he's still alive fighting vampires. One minute a vampire is pulped in a grinding machine, the next scene he's still alive laughing evilly with the other vampires. The characters are just totally bogus in their reactions throughout, I couldn't believe in them or relate to them at all, and they are also bogged down by the horrible continuity errors - what they know vs. what they should know, what's supposedly happening vs what we are actually being shown (e.g. supposedly the female star is about to get burnt alive, but the fire is not even near her) etc etc, minute by minute it all adds up to a complete failure. I wasn't able to feel scared at all."

","I haven't read the comic, and I'm not sure I knew it existed at all until I heard about this film. While by no means a classic, it is good, exciting fun, and the conclusion is fairly cool. The vampires(who have their own unique language) are creepy, eerie, cheesy and hammy. This is a proper R-rated horror flick, something we have *not* seen anywhere near enough of recently. It's pretty reminiscent of the recent Dawn of the Dead remake(2004) in tone and enjoyability factor, and one could compare this to John Carpenter's The Thing for the snowy, isolated aspect. The pace is fairly fast, and this has tension, and a little suspense. Editing and cinematography are well-done, with some use of hand-held camera. The dialog can be funny. There are jump-scares, and this is genuinely entertaining, engaging and effective, and delivers what it promises. The acting varies a tad, and other than Huston, this does suffer somewhat under there being no powerhouse performances. I like Melissa George(who, as Alias showed us, can put on a convincing American accent), and I don't have a problem with Hartnett, however, neither of them manage to carry this all that well. The FX are marvelous. This doesn't have a lot of backstory, and the plot may not hold up to close scrutiny, but if you just want popcorn cinema, this will do nicely. There is a ton of bloody, gory violence and a bit of strong language in this. The DVD comes with 72(not 79, as the cover claims) minutes worth of well-done, interesting and informational featurettes and quite a few trailers. I recommend this to anyone else who likes this particular guilty pleasure of a sub-genre. 7/10"
"pkzeewiz","7","0","1","8 April 2010"," one of my favorite vampire movies
","I have never been a huge fan of vampire movies, most are too vanilla in the gore. I have liked a few throughout the years and wasn't expecting much with this one but it turned out to be a favorite of mine.<br/><br/>In Alaska there is 30 days of darkness and in the town of Barow, many of the towns people flee and it is a small isolated and very dark place for 30 days. When a gang of vampires find this town they set out to kill people one by one.<br/><br/>This film was shot in New Zealand, not Alaska and director David Slade did a wonderful job. I am not familiar with any of his work, except music videos and Hard Candy, all of which he did a great job on. Slade is currently working on the new Twilight:Eclipse movie. Sam Raimi was the first one on board to direct and I would've loved to see that, but he decided to just produce the film instead. David had some great shots and the sets were great, often using C.G.I. and lots of fake snow, but still did the job. Steve Niles wrote the story and shopped it around many times and got numerous doors slammed in his face at the movie studios. He eventually turned this into a comic book, then it was picked up for a movie. He had the screenplay written and not a whole lot was changed.<br/><br/>Acting wise most were pretty good. Josh Hartnett is too young for me to take serious as a town sheriff, but he was okay. Ben foster is a perfect actor to me and always takes a part and becomes the guy he's playing. Mark Boone Junior is another guy who often plays a bad guy, or someone your not suppose to like character wise, and he amazes me.<br/><br/>The vampires in this movie were absolutely perfect.. I loved the vampires, they were so pale, with jet black eyes, big teeth, and did these cool screams all of the time. The language they used was entirely made up for this film. These guys were cool vampires.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie, it made my 3rd time watching it and I could watch it again and enjoy it..highly recommended."

","To watch this movie was fun, but it is not a movie that I would describe as ""great"" or would want to watch again. It is thrilling at a couple of moments, but there could have been more tension. Maybe the scriptwriter had no idea how? Again, it is not a bad movie. It's fine for a nice evening. The negative thing is, that the entire stuff could have happened in one or two nights /days. At no moment I had the impression, that this took 30 nights /days. The script lacks reality at this point and at many others. The next point probably depends on the version I have watched, but at the end he killed the vampire boss and the other vampires just disappeared. Why? Where? To infect himself with vampire blood was silly. This point does not make any sense and I hate the end. We all know, that this story is fictional, so why try to give it a ""realistic"" ending? We have no idea, why she had left her friend. We hear nothing about the fact that the outside world probably tried for 30 days to get in touch with the town. When you look at the logic of the script, than this movie is bad. When you just enjoy it and do not try to the brightest movie ever, than this movie can be fun."

","As a whole the movie is OK, nothing special but certainly not the worst horror movie ever made (or even the worst vampire movie ever made). But these have to be some of the WORST vampires ever depicted on film.<br/><br/>First, their screams and howls are not scary at all, just annoying. By the middle of the movie I just wanted them to shut up and do their business in silence.<br/><br/>Second, they are too damn messy. Why all the waste? If you were a vampire, and presumably you don't have a limitless supply of human blood to partake of (why else would they go to Barrow and not a major city like New York?), wouldn't you maybe try not to get all the blood all over the ground and/or your face and clothes? Why not try bottling it? These vamps just jump on and start ripping and sucking and thrashing away and the blood goes everywhere.<br/><br/>Third, the leader. What was scary about him? Why was he the leader? He didn't do ANYTHING through the whole movie except speak a few lines of 'human' and maybe nod and grunt to the other vampires. Then at the end he lets a vampire-newby punch his brain out. And why didn't the other vampires step in? Some sort of vampire code of honor? ""Has to be a fair fight guys..."" <br/><br/>Last, what was up with the scene where the girl gets killed in the snow...the one who is begging for God? Why do the vampires torture her before killing her? Why do they slash her up? PS: Who knew there were so many attractive young women in Barrow, Alaska? Every woman under 30 in the movie is HOT!

Not so good are Danny Huston as head vampire who goes through the whole movie with a dopey-looking open-mouthed expression (one accepts that the open-mouthed bit is a necessary by-product of having one's mouth stuffed with a gobful of fangs), and Melissa George whose character, on the strength of her constant fearful snivelling, must have been the crappest police officer ever."
"brando647","7","0","2","13 January 2010"," Excellent Vampire Film, the Humans are the Weak Element
","While most modern mainstream vampire films seem to feature delicate, romantic depictions of the bloodsuckers, David Slade has done us all a favor and instead brought us the fearsome, deadly creatures of the night we love. The film is an adaptation of the graphic novel by Steve Niles, set in the town of Barrow, Alaska as it settles in for 30 days of darkness. Taking advantage of the town's long-term lack of sunlight, a pack of vampires arrive and the townspeople are left to fight for their survival over the next month. Bloody, tense, and occasionally boring...Slade has managed to create one of the better vampire films I've seen in recent years.<br/><br/>I loved the visual style of Slade's film, courtesy of cinematographer Jo Willems. Willems captured the cool, dark tones of the graphic novel with splashes of color (primarily blood red) and I thought the film was beautiful. The violence was graphic and often brutal, giving the film the hard R rating it deserves with decapitations and dismemberment to satisfy the gore-hounds, and there's a scene with a trencher that stands out as one of the best action spots in the film. I would've easily ranked this film amongst my favorite horror movies if it weren't for the fact that nearly the first two-thirds of the film drag on so badly. The film grabs your attention from the start with the weird happenings around Barrow (stolen satellite phones found burned, town dogs murdered) but then it grinds to a near halt as the survivors spend the next hour hiding, moving from one spot to the next, while the audience is desperate for something to happen.<br/><br/>The best performance in the film comes from Ben Foster, as a mysterious Stranger who wanders into town before night and gleefully warns the town of their impending fate. He was exceptionally creepy, with his disheveled appearance and Cajun growl. Danny Huston also stands out powerfully as Marlow, the alpha of the vampire pack. One of the creepiest moments in the film has Huston mocking his prey while she pleads ""Oh God"", Huston taking a moment to glance around the sky in search before staring her in the eye and uttering...""No God"". The vampires really were the stars of this film; with their pupil-less eyes, pale skin, and jowls covered in blood from their recent kills, these are the vampires we want to see...primal and animalistic in nature. The humans in the film don't fair so well. The performances weren't terrible but they were outshone by their undead costars and I spent most moments eagerly awaiting the next attack scene instead of becoming involved in their struggles. Josh Harnett does a fair job as Eben Oleson, the sheriff of Barrow and leader of the human survivors. Melissa George, beautiful as she is, adds nothing too significant to the cast as Eben's estranged wife.<br/><br/>The vampires are what make this movie so fun to watch but we spend a bit too long hiding from them, rather than confronting them. The first time I saw the film, I lost interest pretty fast until the final act when the humans began to fight back with whatever tools they could find. Still, I don't judge the film too harshly because it was one of the few as of late to paint vampires in a more bloodthirsty light, and for that, this film is worth watching."
"ctomvelu1","7","0","2","12 July 2009"," Nasty and scary
","30 DAYS is the best vampire flick since K. Bigelow's classic NEAR DARK. A roving band of eastern European vampires hits a small Alaskan town and quickly slaughters most of its inhabitants. Then the group begins to hunt down the few survivors. The vampires are extremely bloodthirsty, animal-like creatures, relentless and absolutely heartless in their search for blood. Josh Hartnett plays the town's sheriff who tries to save a handful of town folk and figure a way to defeat the creatures. Veteran character actor Danny Huston is the vampire group's very scary leader, and another character actor, Ben Foster, plays a man on the run from the vampires. In fact, the opening sequence of Foster hightailing it through the snowy wilderness is reminiscent of the opening scene of John Carpenter's THE THING, where the sled dog is on the run across the frozen Antarctic tundra from the desperate Norwegians. 30 DAYS is extremely atmospheric, gory without being over the top, and truly frightening. The entire film takes place in shadows and darkness, as the sun has set for 30 days, hence the title. Much has been made of the overhead shots of the initial carnage, and rightly so. Choreographing it must have been akin to staging a small war. In the end, the film goes on a bit too long, and lifts its ending from one of the BLADE flicks, but not to worry. You are guaranteed to be on the edge of your seat during this one."

This mythical, bloodthirsty creature has most definitely lost its appeal to me. The movie itself was alright, I suppose. But it was certainly nothing to rave about. The use of vampires just kind of lost the entire movie for me. When vampires become too common, there is no fear left instilled in the viewers.

","30 Days of Night was originally a graphic novel(big comic book) written by Steve Niles and Illistrated by Ben Templesmith. The novel is a masterpiece, so much for the film. I look at all movies as movies, making this one no exception. I'm not comparing it to it's literary counterpart one bit.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Alaska were a series of bizarre crimes are being committed during the last day of daylight. There is a small sub-plot between the two main characters Eben the sheriff of Barrow Alaska, and Stella Olsen of the fire department. A break up has just occurred or something, but it doesn't really affect the story too much. Well vampires start arriving and the citizens of Barrow must survive 30 days in the dark while blood sucking vampires roam outside. The plot is interesting as the characters hide to survive, being stuck with a crazy old man, and other issues such as enough food and water.<br/><br/>Josh Harnett gives a ridiculous performance and I did not enjoy at all compared to his other movies. The ending is interesting and touching in a sort of way. The vampires are the real treat though. 30 Days of Night makes the vampire scary again with excellent performances and a just plain creepy look to them, they leave a shocking effect. The film has quite a lot of depth for a horror - action film. The back-story for the creepies is vaguely displayed but it's enough to interest. If you pay attention to any made-up language in a film, there is always depth. In this ""Vampire Tongue"", God is said as ""gah"" and lots of tick sounds are in there accent.

Mainly, I liked that the vampires weren't suave or brooding or angsty teens. It's nice to have vampires as monsters, the way they should be: they hate, they eat, they destroy, they move on. Plus, there was some decent gore, and even though it looked very CGI and pretty, it worked within the confines of its comic book source. Performances were good all around, and I can't believe little Ben Foster who I used to watch on the Disney channel is so good at being crazy and dirty.<br/><br/>A few things didn't work for me. One, the attempts at emotional depth. I really never cared enough about the characters to really worry about their plight. Ordinarily, this isn't a problem in horror films, but there were several clumsy attempts to tug at the heartstrings and those just made the film grind to a halt for me. I also had a problem with the vampires going hog wild on the town at the beginning. You have 30 days, gang. Chill for a bit and enjoy the scenery or ski or something. What's the purpose of trying to do in the whole food supply at the very beginning and then having 28 more days to hang around?

"pyrocitor","6","0","1","26 April 2008"," Gruesomely entertaining but disappointingly flawed exercise in mainstream horror
","In terms of inciting premises, few prove as fitting as the prospect of an Alaskan town, plunged into a thirty day period with no sunlight being attacked by a vicious roaming tribe of vampires. The isolated setting and uniquely unsettling natural circumstances set the scene for what should have been one of the most supremely gripping and utterly chilling horror epics to grace the cinema in years. Unfortunately, while Hard Candy director David Slade initially proved just the man for the job, it is his reliance on trite horror conventions which ultimately descends 30 Days of Night from the superb film it should have been to the lacklustre resulting product. <br/><br/>The plot proves oddly reminiscent to classic Hitchcock thriller The Birds through its similar lack of context in the midst of a supernatural crisis. Instead of flooding the audience with eye-rolling historical exposition explaining the backstory of the vampires, Slade cuts right to the chase, so to speak, ignoring such qualms as to why and how the vampires arrived in Alaska and immediately immersing the audience in a breathless fight for survival. However laudable the lack of unnecessary volumes of backstory for the vampires is, a middle ground between it and the complete absence of context would have done wonders, elucidating certain questions and making for a more rich and compelling watch. Similarly, the weak script, leaving next to no room for character development and providing many implausible twists in character motivation, laughably clichéd horror situations and a painfully contrived ending seriously detracts from what could otherwise have been a staunchly quality horror piece.<br/><br/>Slade's film excels on the technical front, its quality especially boosted by the unusually effective cinematography. Mercifully shying away from the trendy nausea of ""shaky-cam"", the film astutely alternates between jarring, abrasive close-ups and sweeping crane shots (one sequence where the camera pulls back to a bird's eye view of the town, surveilling the helpless denizens being gruesomely obliterated by the vampire onslaught is eerily beautiful), perfectly capturing the desolate beauty of the Alaskan setting. Similarly, Brian Reitzell's musical score proves one of the most effective horror scores in recent memory, its harmonious pounding and screeching exquisitely complimenting the carnage. However, considering the film's reliance on its action setpieces to provide thrills, the action sequences, while suitably bloody, are often clunky and poorly executed, failing to generate more than a routine level of suspense or terror. <br/><br/>Particularly laudable is the treatment of the vampires themselves - in an age where such creatures are often portrayed as slick and classy, it is a breath of fresh air to see this new incarnation of vampires: feral, bloodstained, thankfully portrayed by real actors and not computer generated, and worthy of fear, even if their curiously animalistic movements draw parallels to enemy creatures in most modern shooter games, and the vampire makeup varies between overdone and almost non-existent, either way distracting in its inconsistency. One also gets the feeling that the creatures would prove more chilling with the exclusion of Danny Huston's ""vampire speech"", as his few hackneyed lines, spoken in a barking dialect only serves to deter from their overall menace. <br/><br/>While the quality of the cast may not descend to the banal dredges which would normally plague such a work, few manage to contribute anything of interest performance-wise. While the typically wooden Josh Hartnett musters a sliver more emotion than his past work, he still remains far too flat a lead to capture the audience's sympathies or often interest. Melissa George similarly remains firmly imbedded in the realm of ""stock female action support and love interest"" - while George is hardly as abysmal as she could have been, she certainly doesn't offer much in terms of charisma or emotional realism. Danny Huston adds a dash of class as the head of the vampires, though whether the odd imbalance between the humanity and feral aspects of his character was intentional or not remains a constant question throughout. Ben Foster steals the show as the unnervingly captivating mysterious stranger whose arrival heralds the coming of the vampires, and Foster's fiercely convincing portrayal of a man utterly consumed by the grasp of madness is the film's only truly worthwhile performance. Character actor Mark Boone Junior is mostly wasted as a shaggy social recluse forced to battle for his life with the rest of the villagers. <br/><br/>A slew of frustrating inadequacies take what could have been an instant classic of the horror genre, and instead strand it in the realm of the mediocre. While 30 Days of Night offers many a scare and a gruesomely entertaining watch, don't expect much in the ways of profundity or innovation to the usual genre conventions - overall worth seeing for those willing to take it for what it is.<br/><br/>-6/10"
"zikejl","4","0","2","20 April 2008"," Serious Timeline Issues
","I had some really serious issues with how poorly the timeline was established in this movie. All 30 days just seem to blend into 1. The director/writer had to know that they would face a challenge establishing the change of time when it is supposed to be dark all the time. Thus, they should have planned accordingly and done a better job of establishing the timeline in the film. As it exists, the first night, the time in the diner, the time in the attic, and the time in the factory, all seem like exactly the same night. There is one line that indicates that they were in the attic for awhile, something along the lines of ""who knew we would make it this long?"", but they only go to the market once before they go to the factory. What are they living off of the rest of the time? Why did the vampires seem to kill almost everyone in the same night and then linger on starving for the rest of the 30 days? How many days were they in the attic? How many days at the factory? This is handled very poorly and because of this the film lacks any sense of desperation and suspense that comes with being trapped somewhere for days. Only the one elderly man hints at that, but he is portrayed as more senile than stir crazy. I honestly was shocked when one of the characters said that the sun was going to come up again the next day. I seriously thought that they have only been dealing with this for like 2 days. Where were the vampires hanging around for the 29 days between when they killed 99% of the town and finally went after the rest? Production should have taken a tip or two from films like Anne Frank, where endless days are passed in one attic, but we feel the days passing in slow agony just as the characters do. The lack of attention to timeline completely ruined this film for me and made it quite amateur. Anyone in the business for any length of time should have been able to better address this. They really should be embarrassed."
"ExpendableMan","7","0","3","11 April 2008"," Innovative and atmospheric Vampire movie
","The Arctic circle isn't exactly the place you'd normally expect to find Vampires, but that's where they head in 30 Days of Night, a refreshing take on an over-populated genre that sees an isolated Alaskan town besieged by a pack of bloodsuckers during a month of constant darkness. It's not a classic horror by any means but it has several tricks up its sleeve to ensure that the film remains one of the more memorable of its ilk and definitely a decent choice for a night in with the TV on.<br/><br/>What makes 30 Days Of Night so unique is down to several things. Firstly, the setting - the sweeping Alaskan wilderness lends a wonderfully doom-laden atmosphere to the film; the town losing all touch with the outside world as the sun sets. The frozen and desolate landscape makes the battle for survival seem all the more fruitless, as well as lending itself to some eerily beautiful cinematography. Second are the Vampires themselves. On film, they normally seem to be portrayed as tragic figures of eternal darkness (a la Interview with the Vampire) or trenchcoat wearing hedonists that listen to Industrial music (see; the Blade trilogy or Buffy the Vampire Slayer). The ones in 30 Days Of Night however are neither, they're just voracious animals who delight in ripping people to pieces and don't think twice about tormenting young girls for the sake of their bloodlust. Yes okay, the aforementioned trenchcoats are still in place but these aren't a group of hip youngsters who supplement their slaughter with pop culture references, they're pure evil unleashed in its most primitive form. And at least they don't all have New Rock boots on.<br/><br/>Thirdly there's the acting. Josh Hartnett is reliably down to earth as the local sheriff but quite frankly, him and his relatives/friends/co workers are all rather dull. Thank God then for Danny Huston and Ben Foster as the villains, Huston going beyond the call-of-duty to deliver a frighteningly convincing portrayal of the pack leader, while Foster exudes menace as his human agent. Foster especially is terrific, giving a deliciously creepy performance that is almost certainly going to get him typecast in similar roles from now on. He's so unsettling in fact that it's almost a relief when the pack turns up and start tearing the limbs off townspeople. Sure, your arm might be gone from the elbow down and the stump is already frosting over with ichor, but at least you don't have to hang out with that weird Southern boy anymore.<br/><br/>That being said, 30 Days Of Night is no instant classic by any stretch, but is a taut and effective little shocker with some grisly set pieces to keep the adrenaline going. Mark Boone's rampage with some heavy duty mining equipment at the half way point is the obvious highlight and there's plenty of factory machines for characters to get minced up in. Shame then that pacing of the film is at odds with itself, days flashing past abruptly and without any change to the present scenario. Plus, a sizable portion of the story relies heavily on the ""we've got to get across town, hope we don't meet any vampires"" theme. Once they've run to the restaurant, then an attic, then a convenience store, then a factory you'll be screaming at them to simply stay where they are. By and large though, this is a survival horror that relies entirely on the atmosphere and it remains constantly foreboding and oppressive throughout. Well worth a watch indeed."

","I love horror movies, and it takes a lot to impress me. To get a good ranking in my book, the movie has to offer more than just ""slash and kill"" fun. 30 Days of Night, offers only the traditional body count method of making a horror film. The overall concept, vampires heading to Barrow Alaska for the annual ""30 days of night"" is pretty interesting, although Barrow actually has 67 days of night and it is not total darkness, there is actually a bright twilight around noon each day during those 67 days, but the sun never breaks the horizon. So Hollywood plays with the facts a little, no big deal. Character development was horrible, the acting was half-rate, and the ending was just bizarre. 30 Days of Night is a great movie if you are looking for 112 minutes of violence, blood, and gore. If you are looking for a true horror movie with a plot, you will need to look elsewhere."

","30 Days of night was actually an OK film in my own opinion, the only flaw I found in it was that it felt a little long, the action scenes had a few moments, but the storyline seemed to fall flat in terms of new ideas, the vampires were definitely presented in a different way, but the overall storyline is just about a handful of people trying to survive 30 days of night being hunted by vampires, and thats pretty much it, no major character development and no complicated story that draws you in, its just straight forward and simple.<br/><br/>I do disagree with reviews stating that the film had two weak leads, Josh Hartnett and Melissa Goerge's performances may not have carried the film but they did give good performances, considering I've always thought you can't really judge the acting in this type of film or any other horror film, because there are some good horror movies with relatively bad acting, and bad horror movies with actors you don't ever want to see again.<br/><br/>Overall, good horror movie with good acting, just a bit slow."
"Aaron1375","7","0","1","4 March 2008"," Rather good, bloody vampire movie...though not without its flaws.
","For the most part I enjoyed this movie, however, I thought it could have been better too. The story has a the town of Barrow, Alaska about to go into its yearly ritual of 30 days of night. A time when the sun doesn't come. However, this year things are going to be particularly bad as a group of vampires are coming to town for a thirty day feeding frenzy. Let's just say that they do not take to long making their presence known as they begin slaughtering the citizens soon after sundown. I was thinking at this point they should be thinking about pacing themselves because unlike the real Barrow, Alaska where I think there are quite a few people this one is limited to like 150 people during the dark month. Soon we are left with the sheriff and a few survivors doing what they can to avoid being on the menu. Lot's of blood as to be expected and for the most part it is pretty good. Still, in places the camera work and editing make the movie seem rather choppy and I had a rather hard time telling what was going on. The vampires were not distinct enough for me and for some reason spoke in a foreign language which I found rather unnecessary. Also, I doubt if anyone else thought this, but I kept thinking the way the movie was setup was a bit familiar. It reminded me of the Australian or New Zealand zombie flick ""The Undead"". I mean we have the initial stage of chaos, survivors finding rather good shelter (here in an attic, in that movie a fallout shelter), a town isolated, and even a scene in a local store where our troops gather supplies and run across another creature. Of course, that movie was funny while this one is almost completely devoid of humor. Still though, it is a nice little horror movie with a great concept...just needed a little work here and there."

","Okay, you live in a town that is notoriously famous for having 30 days of darkness once a year. You live in Alaska, so without sunlight you're pretty sure it's going to be cold and barley livable. Lets throw a large group of vampires in the mix and see what happens... David Slade's look at this scenario is well shot and full of graphic gore tactics that will make any true horror fan proud. However, I was not thrilled with a lot of the ""Quick-Cut"" action, and found myself rewinding way too many times to slow it down and try to see what just happened. When the audience is allowed to see the violence in real-time, the results are incredible... This is a very well crafted take on the vampire legend, and volumes ahead of suck-fest films like ""Blade"" and ""Underworld"". Here the vampires are fierce creatures of night, whom tend to rip their victims to shreds as opposed to biting their necks. Danny Huston is truly frightening as the undead leader, and Josh Hartnett does a fine job of selling the drama, but I had a hard time with the ending, which I found lame and pretentious... Don't get me wrong, this is a decent horror film and well-worth a viewing or two, I just wish the ending left me wanting more... It didn't. You will however see some of the best gore since ""From Dusk Til Dawn"", and some of the creepiest settings since ""Storm Of The Century"". By far the best be-headings ever put on film..."

","Having lived in Alaska for years it is hard for me to get over the ridiculous inconsistencies that were really for no good reason. If you are a fan of the comic then you have some plot background. Not so with the film. It seemed like they edited with a butcher knife to make it fit the genre slot. <br/><br/>I was actually excited about this film, which may be why I am so disappointed.<br/><br/>New Zealand is the generic world setting these days and if you aren't sure where it was filmed odds are it was in New Zealand.<br/><br/>I do have to give them credit for creating a pretty decent ""Barrow' atmosphere, and the filmography was good. I just wish they would have worked the plot together better because now I am sure that I don't have to worry about vampires, these ones just were not believable.

","Let me start by saying that I think the comic book 30 days of Night is one of the most overrated comic books in recent history. After reading it once I tried to give it to some friends of mine. After they read it, they brought it back to me, they didn't want it either.<br/><br/>So when I heard Steve Niles sold the rights to his book for one million dollars to Sam Raimi's production company I was hopeful that they would turn it into something worth watching. Sadly they stuck close to the source material.<br/><br/>I've never in my life seen a two hour movie that actually made me feel like I had been siting in the theater for thirty days. The problem is this movie takes itself too seriously, just as the comic book before it had. There are action scenes that fall flat, and emotional scenes that carry no weight. The actors all did an admirable job trying to bring their characters to life, but in the end the script just isn't strong enough. The biggest problem with this movie overall, is the score. It just sits there, doing nothing. There is a scene where one of the survivors drives down main street with a piece of heavy machinery running down and cutting through anything that gets in his way. Does the music pulse and thump? Does the music rise as the hero takes a stand and confronts the baddies head on? NO! The music just sits there. We get a few strings, a nearly inaudible tambourine, and an even more inaudible drum cadence. Why? Because the director thinks he's making a scary movie instead of a monster movie. Another scene like this is the final fight. The last stand. As the scene opens we have the hero making a lonely walk toward the center of town. As he begins his walk we get a rock snare thumping. Alright some music!!! Nope. He gets to the center of town and suddenly the drums disappear and instead we get quiet strings and what sound like someone running a drill over guitar strings. Exciting stuff let me tell you. The only reason this movie gets five stars is because the cinematography is really nice. There is one overhead shot near the beginning of the monster invasion that makes you feel like you're there, and helpless to do anything. Kudos to the cinematographer."

","The movie had some great new concepts added to it for future generations to use in new innovative shots. The birds eye view/ fly over showing the vampires attack the town was the defining moment in the movie that showed me true brilliance. The rest of the movie disappointed in so many ways. A majority of the vampire movies that have been effective in the past 25-30 years are the romanticized ones. They add a human element to the vampire, and show his tortured soul. This is the first movie in the past 15 years that has come close to the suspense/terror that Dracula 2000 had.<br/><br/>The vampires had a brutality similar to the vampires in blade 2. They did no seduce you, and put you at ease before the attacked. They were very animalistic and got straight to the point.<br/><br/>Where the movie fell flat is how savage the vampires were. They killed 85% of the two in the span of a few hours. They did not pick off towns people one by one up until the 30 days. The vamps completely gorged themselves in less then a weeks time. So the movie immediately lost A lot of opportunities to establish a better storyline and make you sad when a certain character was killed.<br/><br/>A new tactic was introduced in how to stop vampires. And the ending was somewhat of a disappointment but Rami was clearly trying to go poetic on the ending.<br/><br/>All in All, this is one of the better vampire movies from a suspense standpoint since Dracula 2000, The Lost Boys and Interview with the Vampire. But I expected a lot more from it."

Well lots,<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett cannot lead a movie - his acting range is just too limited. it is almost laughable when he tries to emote. the plot had huge holes and moments of jaw dropping incredulity Spoilers (stop here if you really want to watch this movie) a guy blows himself up to prevent from getting eaten, then a moment later he emerges alive only to have his head crushed by a vampire foot. * the vampires were like extremists - killing randomly, indiscriminately, needlessly, and sadistically toying with their victims all for effect. This was completely unnecessary since they looked the part and were supposedly there to feed but let their food (blood) drain into the snow. This movie was as gory as any in recent memory - multiple beheadings, kid vampires eating their mothers, bodies and limbs torn apart, bodies thrown into a shredder, slow breaking bones. Again this was unnecessary to support the plot or storyline. It was as if the director wanted to make the audience uncomfortable (he succeed).<br/><br/>The ending was ridiculous and completely over the top.

","This movie is hugely entertaining, great special effects, cool ""new"" looking vampires, fantastically gory but the plot, well, that's the only thing absent in this movie... so 10 for the Vampires 0 for the plot = 5<br/><br/>What was good? <br/><br/>The location, it has been proved in movies like ""The Thing"" or ""Shinning"" that snowy landscape enhance the feeling of isolation. So the careful set-up, airport closing, 3/4 of the population leaving etc...plays beautifully to install the right mood.<br/><br/>The Vampires themselves are quite cool, purists will complain about the teeth thing, and I can see their point, but all in all they look plain evil, not quite human, but not Nosferatu alike either. Quite liked the guttural language that sounds like an old middle eastern dialect. The strength and agility is there, the blood thirst is there, the contamination by blood/bite is there, so yes they are Vampire. Also to make them even less human (while human looking) they are just dressed in summer dress or suits and still look impervious to the bone-freezing cold.<br/><br/>The gore, well I have to say that it's hard to make a movie that is gory but stays scary. The gore also gives that bestial aspect to the vampires that keeps the viewer indecisive on whether they are more human or more bestial. And probably the most convincing beheading I have ever seen on screen (not to count the one I do in my back garden)<br/><br/>The special effects are very decent and not overdone, that contribute to the cool aspect of the vampires.<br/><br/>What's not good? <br/><br/>The Vampires start the movie as a cunning, well organised deadly killing machine and end up little less than a bunch of savage gathered together by a pack leader. I would like to understand why after methodically making sure that no communication means were left (mobile phone burnt, sledge dogs slaughtered, internet/radio/phone station destroyed and helicopter in pieces), that the power station is neutralised (within the first few hours of the first day) do they become so stupid (aside for justifying the title). They use baits to find out survivors, they obviously kept a few alive as snacks too, but why? Why after being obviously aware of the start of the 30 days of night does it take them 19 days and a few hours to raze the town to burning cinders? Why did they not, after the first 24hours searched systematically each house and then burn them to find hiding survivors?<br/><br/>Granted they are Vampires, they don't feel bullets much (or so it seems), but they are not impossible to kill (shotgun to the head, beheading etc...) why is there is only one fire axe available in the movie, no chainsaw either...just one axe...lame...<br/><br/>The time span, this is the worst let down of the movie because it kills the atmosphere built at the start of the movie, and barely explained how the survivors manage to sneak and get food, water and other 1st supplies. It's just jumps from day 1 to 7 to 27 and then last day it says how little ideas the writer had for the plot. The time span ads nothing to the plot, it doesn't really re-enforced the sense of survival because the gaps are too large, nor does it gives a feeling of hope as they close to the return of the sun.<br/><br/>The snow, well it's beautiful but had the very bad habit of leaving tracks that could be used by the vampires to follow the survivors Where the Hell have the remaining vampire gone a few hours before sunset in a burning city? <br/><br/>What could have been done to make the movie better? <br/><br/>Drop the 30 days of night idea and replace it by a rare long sun eclipse or something like that, this would have probably saved the movie as the survival and struggle would have been for a few days and there would have been no need to explain the painful inactivity of the vampires.<br/><br/>Not necessarily kill the entire city in the first few hours of the first day, this would also have given the survivors with more casualties for the the following days.<br/><br/>Trying to kills the vampires traditional ways (holywater from the church, wooden stick in the heart...) only to find this doesn't work<br/><br/>May be put some more weapons at the disposal of the survivors, how about taking the UV bulbs and fixing them on lamp torch? That would have created some cool weapon for little cost.<br/><br/>Find another non cheesy ending. <br/><br/>So as you can see, it's a decent movie let down by the plot (as many are), watch it if you like vampires without being a purist, watch it, just make sure you don't spend too much money on it."

","Well, I read some of the comments before watching the movie (doh) and had a good feeling about it, so I was looking forward.<br/><br/>And I must say I find this one of the best vampire movies I have seen , though I have to mention I normally hate them so it doesn't make this an oscarwinner.<br/><br/>It starts of decent, from the first minute on one can tell this movie is filmed and directed by someone who has a good eye for it. Nice cameramovements, the right lighting etc. Then the mayem begins, the typical first victims who are clueless to what is going on and then the part where everyone is getting aware that 'theres something fishy' going on.<br/><br/>I can cope with all that went down until they started hiding in the attic, after that, the storyline got pretty messy. They keep running back and forth and the joy I had watching it so far kinda went down the drain when I saw the huge leaps in time. If you had to hide days and days in fear for vampires it would get to you, but the characters look the same as on day 1.<br/><br/>A lot of stuff obviously doesn't make sense, like if they can smell blood (as said in the movie) why didn't the vampires find them. One was in the same house and díd smell them, but then never came back. Also the fat guy surviving that blast was not very realistic and since he dies 20 seconds later I would have let him evaporate in the blast.<br/><br/>And finally the last part, where he injects vampireblood in his arm, sigh. If he really got their strength minutes after receiving the blood then why didn't that guy under the house (forgot the name)who was also infected (..and stayed under the house for days in that weather?) also get so strong? And so useless.. 15 minutes after injecting himself, the sun is rising! Stella and the girl have to get away from the car otherwise they would burn. Uhm, It took a few minutes for that sunrise to kick in, they had way more chance when staying under the car and wait it out. Then he didn't have to inject himself.. ah well, you get my point.<br/><br/>In short, not bad, good effects (overhead shot is cool) good start, lame middle and ending. Camera-work/atmosphere is well done."

The acting is good, well crafted and characters are believable, but there are moments that seem to help take the suspense out of some of the moments. (such as when they arrest The Stranger (another nice performance by Ben Foster) from the beginning of the movie at the diner where Melissa George and Josh Hartnett have an absurd moment that just seemed odd and out of place for the situation).<br/><br/>2. Original plot and story. The setting is very original, the story line and plot devices are nice and original. This is even more enforced by the acting and pretty suspenseful story telling. (such as when you hear Ellen's voice screaming over the radio, after their first encounter with the vampires).<br/><br/>3. Action and effects are well done. Lots of good blood and effects, as well as real action. Some are short and sweet but enough to keep things interesting and are important to keeping the story and plot moving forward.<br/><br/>The weak points of the movie are pretty minor because the humans are really what the movie is about, I say this because of the vampires characters were pretty bland and not very interesting. They were more like zombies and vampires mixed together. A little played out already."

We are very early introduced to the main characters Eben and Stella, and it is very early made clear that their love turmoils are going to drag through the whole movie.

Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost community of the United States, has entered an extended period of polar night in which the sun fails to ""crack dawn"" for a good long time (the film posits a titular thirty days, but in truth it lasts more than two months). In the movies, we all know what comes out at night to play: bad things. In this case, vampires, and there's none of that decadent, dandified, pseudo-romantic Ann Rice crap. Director David ""Hard Candy"" Slade and writers Stuart ""Derailed"" Beattie, Brian ""Hard Candy"" Nelson, and Steve ""I created the original comic book"" Niles treat their audience to bloodsuckers who possess nary a trace of a redeeming characteristic. They sport formidable dentures and an aggressive attitude to match, not to mention some pretty sloppy table manners. In fact, it's the vampires that make ""30 Days of Night"" a sanguine guilty pleasure to watch, since most all their victims are either relatively faceless fodder or, regrettably, characters that we're never really led to care all that much about.<br/><br/>Still, the acting is tolerable, with special kudos to Danny ""Children of Men"" Huston as one of the more impressive and disturbing villains I've seen in a while, and Ben ""Hostage"" Foster as his doomed harbinger. Josh ""Sin City"" Hartnett, local cop, leads what few humans survive the initial vampiric onslaught, including estranged wife (Melissa ""Derailed"" George), kid brother (Mark ""Arthur"" Rendall), local salt-of-the-earther (Mark ""Batman Begins"" Boone Junior), and NZ/Aussie star Manu ""The Condemned"" Bennett as Hartnett's benighted sidekick. Production values are high, with art direction, production design, and cinematography appropriately dark and menacing; all in all, it's a nice, creepy, claustrophobic visual realization, much along the lines of John Carpenter's ""The Thing."" The plot is a straightforward ""circled wagons"" yarn, laced with some nicely stark dialog that only rarely makes you cringe. The visuals and make-up fx are excellent, with plenty of blood and mayhem to satisfy even jaded gorehounds. Some of the intro storytelling seems perfunctory, or perhaps overly edited to save time, but once the vampires strike in force, ""30 Days..."" goes for the throat with carnivorous gusto. If nothing else, it's a definite thumbs-up for feral vampire fans (not to mention fans of feral vampires).<br/><br/>I see that a sequel is in the works, but I won't expect it to be anything to write home about. ""30 Days of Night"" sports a few too many ""oh, c'mons"" to pass muster as a classic, but it wraps itself up tidily enough to claw its way above the lower ranks of fang films. A sequel will most likely tarnish whatever bloodstained, frostbitten notoriety ""30 Days of Night"" has achieved. It was a worthy 2d-run night out, and possibly will merit time on the DVD player this winter, but for sheer fright-film entertainment, I preferred ""The Mist,"" to be honest."

","The vampires in this movie are not the usual vampires you see in other movies. This vampires are more fiercer and more of a beast. When they talk to each other, they growl or speak in their own language ( I don't know what they are speaking). 30 days of night is a violent movie not for the faint-hearted, it is gory and beautiful ( in some ways). The background is beautiful, like pure ice. But in the end, it become red as blood will flow when the beastly vampires come and munch their ways through. It is not beautiful anymore.<br/><br/>The story is simple, Alaska is shrouded in darkness for 30 days. Can you believe it? Josh Hartnett stars as the main character in this movie. He brings some survivors into hiding from the vampires. Guess what? Not many survivors can escape. The vampires always can find them and it is time for them to fight them off. Include some head-chopping scenes. Those who did not read the comic, it brings you into knowing how the survivors are going to ward off the vampires. Other than that, the first 30 minutes seems boring and the violence seems the same. The same head-chopping scenes. This can bring laugh or smile if you are not the serious type. For me, I laughed at the vampires' suits. They look less scarier and look like infected business men who don't bother to take off their suits.<br/><br/>Overall: Those who like hard-core gory violent movie or fans of vampires movies, watching this will entertain you. It has its suspense to hold you to the seats. Those who are faint-hearted, steer away from this violent movie."
"schism101","7","0","2","26 November 2007"," Enjoyable Take on the vampire film.....
","Based in the graphic novel of the same name and co-produced by Sam Rami, 30 DAYS OF NIGHT is an interesting take on the vampire myth. Set in the small Alaskan town of Barrow, it begins on the final day of sunlight for 30 days (hence the title) and townsfolk who cant handle it pack up and leave leaving quite a few to brace the coming month. This leaves a group of vampires, who descend on the small town, a practical all you can eat human- buffet. Those who don't fall victim to the bloodsuckers, have to survive and fight back and avoid becoming victim to the vamps. Despite some plot holes and slight ropey dialogue in parts, 30 DAYS, handles very well as a genre film and contains enough blood and action and suspense to keep fans of the genre happy. The central human characters Josh Hartnett playing the town sheriff who has to protect the remaining townspeople and Melissa George as his recently separated wife, are decently convincing, but most impressive of all is the vampires, led by Danny Huston, who look nasty and are just that. These bloodsuckers carry unusual looking features, rounded out by super strength, razor sharp teeth and a strange foreign accent sounding something like Romanian or Hungarian, make them stand out as a formidable and terrifying assortment of memorable vampires. A decent and overall entertaining horror film."
"dyer9380","5","0","2","29 October 2007"," Actually -- a little too fast and a little too dull...
","Sorry everybody - I had high hopes for this movie; a scare-fest it was not. From the 'jiggly-camera' school of cinematography to the perpetual (and eventually annoying) screechy howl-y screams of the vampires...""Hey, let's all growl, then shriek! All together now!"" the whole thing was less of a reinvention and much more of a cobbling together of the last ten vampire films out there.<br/><br/>The predictable nature of the story - the creepy herald of doom at the beginning, followed by the lights going out, and then the small group of survivors trapped hopelessly, then getting picked off one by one, and finally the whole ""ultimate sacrifice"" at the last five minutes just felt contrived. And once again, Hollywood has to pop the blood-capsules right and left...they would have had much more of a terror effect had we seen less blood and more suspense."

","I grew up with Christopher Lee and his version of a vampire. Staying up until 1 or 2am (while younger than a teenager) I remember going to bed and unable to sleep after watching one of his movies. I found the characters and their situations believable (more or less), and the director tried hard to generate a general sense of suspense, a feeling that something was not quite right...<br/><br/>After watching THIS movie however, I think I'll sleep just fine. The story centers around a small Alaskan town that has 30 days of dark every year; this year something goes horribly wrong and it gets overrun by vampires during this time. Good premise and good production values, however there seems to be something missing. Perhaps its because you see everything a bit too soon...I didn't really find the movie very suspenseful. Or maybe it's because of the acting, which struck me as out-of-place in a few places (you can tell someone is actually ACTING being out of breath, as opposed to making you believe he is). Or perhaps it was a general sense of unbelievability to the movie as a whole, not from anything specific but just a gut feeling that prevents you from being able to identify with the characters (or their situation) at anything more than a topographical level. In the end, it was OK Halloween fare (with the price of admission paid for by the looks of the vampires, which I found excellent), but it simply didn't deliver many frights for me...."
"kellykarnetsky","3","0","2","28 October 2007"," Would think this is a straight to DVD film
","The story line of this movie was a joke for a mainstream Hollywood movie. This is a brief description of the movie: The main character is an ax murdering sheriff in the town of Barrow, Alaska. The story starts out showing you that there is no way these people are getting out of this town for 30 days. Then in the next 20 minutes everyone seems to be dead and you are thinking to yourself that was a quick movie, then what's the point? It turns out that these ""vampires"" ( I put them in quotes because it doesn't exactly explain what they are ) are here because people don't know who they are! But then the ""vampires"" turn around and say that they need to kill everyone so there is no trace? I don't understand this contradiction in the movie. The story jumps from Day 1 to Day 7 looking like it was the same night then they jump to Day 18 with the same looking night, no one was fatigued or going insane from being cooped up in small spaces hiding.<br/><br/>Then they from Day 28 to 29 in what seemed to be a single conversation. The sheriff injects himself with this powerful ""vampire"" blood and goes out to fight the main ""vampire"" because the ""vampires"" are trying to burn down the town so there is no trace and it looks like a freak accident.<br/><br/>So anyway the sheriff goes outside and after only two minutes of fighting with all the other ""vampires"" standing around in a circle shrieking, the main ""vampire"" jumps at the sheriff and the sheriff punches through the main ""vampires"" skull and out the back of his head and the other ""vampires"" run away and that's the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I was bored after the first 45 minutes of this movie until they would kill a little girl or you would see someone either getting cut in half or their head chopped off.<br/><br/>I would not recommend wasting your money at the theaters for this poor written movie."
"emperor_bender","5","0","2","28 October 2007"," Good Idea, Bad presentation
","I went to the movie theater last night expecting to see Saw IV. Much to my displeasure, it was packed. Instead, I suggested to my brother we see 30 Days of Night, expecting to see a masterpiece of cinema.....damn was I ever disappointed! It started off kinda slow, but I figured it was building up to good action. But after I while I thought...""Where is the GOOD action?"" I saw action, but it wasn't GOOD! All I saw were god-like hideous vampires killing every innocent person they could. The townspeople were killed off within hours, And only a group of 8 or 9 people stayed alive by holding up in an attic. They made the vampires WAAAAAAAY too strong. I mean if this was in NYC or something, then it'd be better because at least then there were a lot of people, and police and they could fight them off. But this is a northern Alaskan city in the dead of winter, with less than 200 people. It wasn't even a good fight, it was a massacre on these people who decided to fight out this weather. Also, the main character turned HIMSELF into one to give his wife a chance to run back to the base. But he did it literally an HOUR or 2 before sunrise...he waits a month then suddenly turns himself??? and the lady didn't even run! She sat there and watched him fight the main vampire (who was definitely the only cool one) Over all, it was a great idea, but it could have been SOOOOOO much better 5/10"
"Nevboarding","5","0","2","27 October 2007"," Decent movie but the fact that you can compare it with Interview or Bram stokers.... is god damn disgusting
","The movie was definitely good none the less but it was a zombie style vampire movie. Done very well until the end which was completely butchered. But looking at the fear that you went through when watching this movie was none the less very real and properly done. The jumping scenes was also very well executed. And also the interaction with the vampires was well done creating a powerful view of them but the fact that you don't get to know the vampires(A large lack in character development was one of the biggest problems in this flick). With this said I would have still enjoyed this movie until the insanely horrible ending. If you could sit there in your head and think of the worst possible ending you could not even come close... But were i was going in the long run is the entire fact that you could have this holding an overall rating as 7.3 is f***ing DISGUSTING. That is the same rating as ""Interview with the Vampire"". I just cannot believe what I am seeing... none the less you can criticize this post all you want. You now have my view of this movie and that is all that matters..."
"allman2568","5","0","1","26 October 2007"," Strictly by the numbers...
","This film is being highly overrated by a bored public, or people are just buying the hype. While it is by no means a bad horror movie, it's very reminiscent of many formulaic gore-filled 80s horror films. Which puts it miles above the utter dreck of today following the trend of vomit-inducing gore like Saw and Hostel, but that doesn't change the fact that this film did nothing particularly shocking, moving, terrifying, or new, nor did it serve up the best effects ever, stunning vistas, or a really intense atmosphere. It also did a poor job of making the horrific 30 day war of attrition against the vampires seem like it really took 30 days. On the positive side it did serve up plenty of gory action, and the film never really slowed down, and the buildup at the start is quite ominous for a while. You could do worse, you could do better. At least you're not seeing Saw."
"fortey","6","0","1","26 October 2007"," Not bad, not great
","30 Days gets a lot of hype for reinvigorating the vampire genre. People who aren't clever may even use the term ""new blood"" because they feel it is a cute pun. Whatever. In a nutshell, the movie is pretty decent for a modern day horror flick as it's not a Saw knock off, a teen horror or a Japanese remake. Kudos for that. It does have drawbacks that stop it from being exceptionally good, however.<br/><br/>To start with, the entire concept of the movie seems cool if you just at first hear it. A town that is bathed in night for en entire month gets hit by vampires. Yes indeed, what a concept. Except it's 2007 and if vampires have been surviving just fine for this long, who cares? Are those extra few hours of night every day, in a town with 150 people in it, that important? Seriously? Wouldn't this have worked just as well if the sun still came up? With communications down and vehicles out, where the heck were those people gonna go? Which brings me to another point... why is the town so isolated if it's night? I manage to do stuff at night all the time. Why can't planes still fly? Or trains, or any other thing? Wouldn't life have to continue as normal, wouldn't these people have adapted to that? <br/><br/>The vamps attempt to cover the tracks at the end by burning the town. Convenient exposition tells us it's so when people show up again, they think it was just a tragic accident. Call me crazy but decapitated corpses laying all about a burned down town and an oil pipeline that was smashed to pieces look slightly suspicious. Maybe covering their tracks isn't a huge deal, but unless the most Neanderthal investigative team came to check it out, someone might have noticed it was more than an accident.<br/><br/>30 days. Obviously this is a key point in the film. That's a long haul. I never read the graphic novels to appreciate if the fact that this is an entire month is significant, but it sure isn't significant in the movie. This could be 3 days for all the difference it seems to make. We're never really shown that the length of time has taken any toll whatsoever on the characters involved. They must be sleeping terribly, they're not bathing, and, realistically, it should be freezing cold in every single building, but for the most part they just seem slightly inconvenienced. Two things indicate a passage of time in the movie - scruffy beards and the odd slugline at the bottom of the screen letting us know time has passed. It's really inconsequential.<br/><br/>The movie is also a little longer than it needs to be, insofar as it repeats the same theme a lot. Run and hide and run and hide and run and hide and every so often the number of living people dips a little lower until just a handful are left. And at the same time, we're tossed really random things that get explained very poorly. Like the little girl vampire at the general store. She speaks English, unlike the vamps who raid the town, yet no one else seems to know who she is. Where the heck did she come from? And speaking of little girls, what's with the little girl at the end of the film that Melissa George saves? At first I assumed she was bait like the previous girl we see in the film, only this one is followed by a single vamp who makes no effort to come after the survivors. But..why? <br/><br/>This isn't really a plot issue, but I found myself confused by bald vampires. I could have sworn that bald vampire was killed like 3 times.<br/><br/>The UV lamp scene has to be mentioned, if for no other reason than I almost slapped my head in frustration about it. He runs to granny's house, turns on the generator, hold sup a UV lamp and burns one vamp. Then, surprise, they cut the power. But he runs out the back door and gets away because none of them thought to actually move with any speed or cover that back door while he was in there. It seemed like the vampires were intentionally throwing the game in that scene.<br/><br/>Again, having not read the books, maybe there's a little more story, but honestly the whole in medias res thing with the vampires was bizarre. We never learn where they came from, other than apparently somewhere in Europe, if I had to guess, or much about their little human harbinger who sets up the town for their arrival. All in all, he's a convenient plot device that is quickly dispatched so we need not worry about him any further.<br/><br/>Finally, the end of the movie was just a little bit ridiculous. To me at least. I mean really...he injects himself with vampire blood so he came duke it out with the poor man's Vincent D'onofrio with a faceful of really bad teeth, then he sits and watches the sunrise. Oh, poetry.<br/><br/>Now, aside from all those slams against the movie, it's probably still worth watching if you're down for some impressive gore tossed at you here and there, and some interesting ambiance."
"phantasim69","5","0","1","26 October 2007"," I enjoyed it, but don't spend more than $5 to see it.
","I really enjoyed this new take in the vampire genre. What a clever idea. This film doesn't drag its feet, has action when appropriate and dialog to keep the story line moving. The movie town was based on the real life Barrow, Alaska. I believe in the movie it is Darrow? The movie has no real depth, but the characters are very believable. I was very surprised by the acting, it was very good. This movie has a different ending than most, but not one that is new to us. <br/><br/>Rundown: A imperfect hero smart gun savvy heroine imperfect sidekick, who tries to redeem his crimes, by saving the scene Outcast brought into the fold, but should have waited to blow up the building until more vampires were inside, silly way to die new ""ancient"" vampire language Townspeople missed out on many great ways to save themselves...<br/><br/>I have to say I expected more out of Sam Rami production (but then again he did not direct it). I have lived in Alaska, I own sled dogs. A fast team can cruise at 12mph. A newer Kawasaki snowmobile, 60mph. Killing the dogs was just silly. In Alaska we use bush planes, and the airport never really closes. Our law enforcement keep their own set of Sat. phones.*sigh* OK enough griping. I liked it but left wanting much more, good fun flick."
"dmichel-3","6","0","1","25 October 2007"," Great Cinematography; Cheap Trick Scares; There may be a sequel
","The cinematography was great. Even the violent scenes weren't gratuitous. However, my heart rate never rose while watching this movie. The filmmaker tried to use sudden movement to surprise the audience with gruesome scenes, but no payoff... The movie started very well, and built up my expectations for a thrilling scare fest. Unfortunately, there was no explanation of how the vamps arrived, no explanation of why the arrived, what they were doing there, how they found the place, how they survived for thousands of years, etc, etc, etc.<br/><br/>All in all, a good movie with decent cast, and the most savage portrayal of Vamps. However the story failed to answer many questions, ended very anti-climatic and appeared to set us up for a sequel that may explain many of the questions this film raised."
"mm-39","6","0","1","22 October 2007"," It was OK
","My wife and I went out to see 30 days of night. Monica, my wife, says the movie was OK. It would be awful to have 30 days of nights, and worse to have vampires around, which is the premise of the movie. How could the survivors live if the vampires could smell the human's blood? Well directed and acted. 30 days is similar to 'the thing, with the gross vampires, gross effects and the winter isolation which give a gloomy feel. The vampires wanted to leave no survivors so people would believe that vampires was just a myth. Hence, the vampires could continue on their feedings. I hate the end, but the end was original. My wife give a 5, but I give the movie a 6 out of 10. Definitely a rental"
