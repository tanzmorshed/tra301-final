"gogoschka-1","Null","459","612","11 May 2014"," The perfect blend between character-driven drama and fun, edge-of-your-seat spectacle!
","I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.<br/><br/>It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.<br/><br/>Yet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters – but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot – and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves). <br/><br/>What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations – at least as far as I'm concerned – is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists – what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).<br/><br/>So my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/"
"shawneofthedead","9","338","467","16 May 2014"," A stunning achievement – a blockbuster movie packed with at least as much heart as spectacle.
","With its mind-boggling premise and jaw-dropping cast, X-Men: Days Of Future Past blasts into cinemas bearing the weight of great expectations. Surely this mash-up of X-Men past and future has the potential to be the best superhero blockbuster our world will ever see? Well, yes and no.<br/><br/>To be strictly objective, Days Of Future Past can occasionally come off as a little too earnest, its enormous cast of characters getting somewhat lost in the grinding of its narrative gears. But, when it works (which is most of the time), Days Of Future Past comes pretty darn close to nerdvana – this is a smart, rich film that effectively mines its source material (both the movies and Chris Claremont's classic 1981 storyline in the comic books) and its incredible cast for emotion, power and depth.<br/><br/>Flash forward to the bleakest of futures. X-Men we have known – led by perennial frenemies Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) – are being hunted mercilessly by a horde of intelligent, death-mongering robots known as Sentinels. With little hope for survival, the desperate X-Men decide to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to the 1970s. There, he must find the younger Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) – several years estranged after the traumatic events of X-Men: First Class – and get them to change the future before it can happen.<br/><br/>Sounds simple enough? Not really. Days Of Future Past frequently threatens to fall foul of its complicated puzzle-box of a narrative, one that involves time travel, quantum physics and a swirling mess of characters, action and motivations. There's Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), creator of the Sentinel programme, whose assassination in the past by Charles' pseudo-sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) brings about the dystopia of the future. There are prison breaks, astral projections, and several grisly mutant deaths. Truthfully, this incredibly ambitious mix of character, plot and spectacle could very easily go horribly wrong.<br/><br/>What's so impressive about director Bryan Singer's return to the franchise is how well he weaves all the disparate threads of his narrative together. This is emphatically not the Singer who gave us mediocre misfires like Superman Returns and Jack The Giant Slayer. Rather, this is the work of the Singer who made his mark with films like X1, X2 and The Usual Suspects, all of which featured a masterful blend of wit and wisdom, character and story.<br/><br/>In Days Of Future Past, Singer skilfully plays on the schism that opened up between Erik and Charles at the end of First Class to add welcome depths of emotion to the high stakes already in play. The deep, difficult relationship between the two men has always been the fulcrum of the series, and Singer allows it to breathe and grow. With the help of McAvoy and Fassbender (not to mention Stewart and McKellen), some of the best actors in the business, the director makes it possible to believe that resentment can give way to forgiveness, and vice versa, often in the blink of an eye. McAvoy, in particular, gives a shudderingly good performance as a man called upon to help others when he's lost his own way.<br/><br/>With such an enormous revolving cast of characters, Singer even manages to give many – though not all – of them their hearts and souls. (Alas, Storm/Ororo, we will never know ye!) Thrust into the unlikely role of mentor to the broken, heartsore Charles, Wolverine must find a different sort of strength and ingenuity within himself. Jackman plays the role beautifully, anchoring the two timelines with charm and gravitas. Though still something of an awkward fit for her part, Lawrence, too, plays Raven's dilemma very well, as she wavers between Charles' offer of hope and Erik's often bloody single-mindedness.<br/><br/>But Days Of Future Past doesn't just mire itself in the toss and tumble of its characters' emotional journeys. Singer throws in a few crackerjack action sequences, opening the film with a heart-stopping massacre that very effectively underscores the dire threat posed by the Sentinels of the future. Crucially, Singer also finds the time and space within the darkest shadows of his story to have a little fun, judiciously tossing quips and sight gags into the mix – particularly in a tour de force prison break sequence, in which the preternaturally speedy Pietro Maximoff (Evan Peters), better known to comic aficionados as Quicksilver, literally runs away with the entire show.<br/><br/>Make no mistake about it, this is a behemoth of a film that won't go down well with everybody. Newbies will almost certainly find themselves lost, bewildered, and perhaps even bored. Singer's tale sprawls in so many directions that, if you're not at least marginally invested in the characters, it could prove to be a trying experience.<br/><br/>But, for everyone else, ranging from casual fans to enthusiasts and obsessives, Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg have crafted something truly remarkable. Steeped in history and lore, both of the cinematic and comic-book variety, Days Of Future Past feels like a dark love letter to the spirit of that original band of mutants and the message of hope, tolerance and humanity that has always accompanied their attempts to find their place on Earth.<br/><br/>Most remarkably of all, Days Of Future Past practically radiates a bravery and freshness that you'd never expect from the seventh film in a blockbuster franchise. Instead of playing it safe and sound, Days Of Future Past mashes up past, present and future, sweeping up a lot of what has been taken for granted in the X-Men cinematic universe and, well, chucking it out of the proverbial window. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing plethora of narrative possibilities that stretch in any and all directions. On the strength of this outing, that's something to be anticipated, rather than feared."
"CalRhys","Null","193","271","5 June 2014"," A Visually Stunning And Exhilarating Flick
","2014 has proved to be a successful year so far for Marvel with 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' and the most recent 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. Bryan Singer returns for the most recent X-Men after being absent for the past four films, and what a return he has made. 'Days of Future Past' is truly an impressive and spectacular instalment in both the 'X- Men' franchise and the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, combining the casts from both the original trilogy and the prequel allowing the audience to view the 'X-Men' in the past, present and future. The action scenes are intense and spectacularly choreographed with some fantastic heroes and foes fighting both against and alongside each other. As a personal opinion, 'Days of Future Past' is the best film to have graced the Marvel film franchise and one of the greatest superhero films of all-time. A visually stunning and exhilarating flick that combines the best elements of the series to create a fantastic and entertaining film."
"jigsaw-91","10","374","539","12 May 2014"," Best X-Men movie Yet! Believe It
","I was so intrigued about this movie. I had a terrible feeling of disappointment because First Class was absolutely fine and riveting. That one was even better than X-Men 2 (the last one directed by Brian Singer before this). So I tried to went to see this with low expectation. And what a wonderful entertainment and surprising thoughtful story I found here. Days Of Future Past is the best X-men movie so far for two main reasons:<br/><br/>Fans of the original trilogy and First Class will definitely enjoy this one thanking its nostalgia and its perfect and well balanced mix between the original characters and the new ones (with just a few ones who maybe deserved more credit, but is not at all a problem for the movie). & This movie delivers a surprising top notch entertaining with a potent story and some good twists that help to live up expectations mixed with terrific special effects and cinematography. 3-D is very cool here.<br/><br/>The actors are fantastic. Fassbender and McAvoy still delivering amazing performances meanwhile Stewart and Mckellen give their reflections in the same excellent way that in the trilogy. Hugh Jackman finally finds his character as a true important one in comparison with the last movies. Wolverine/Logan finally has a proper treatment in this movie that will help anyone who could be annoyed with his solo adventures to love him again. They are the five main stars of the story with the inclusion of a spectacular and skillful Mystique (impressive Jennifer Lawrence who steals almost every scene of hers) who is undoubtedly the sixth one. The other actors made good performances and make possible the transitions of the story until the amazing finale.<br/><br/>It has been so many comparisons with The Avengers. Let me tell you something with all my respect. I found this one truly better. X-Men: Days of Future Past will please the fans and moviegoers and will inject fresh blood and joy to the franchise. This is a terrific time at the movies. Don't miss the opportunity to see it."

"edgereviews","10","216","320","28 May 2014"," Not only is it the best X-Men movie, it's one of the best comic book movies ever made....
","X-Men: Days Of Future Past' serves as a sequel to both 'X-Men: First Class' (which is excellent) and 'X-Men: The Last Stand' (which is pretty bad). Now, I used to be a pretty big X-Men fan a few years ago, but after the disappointments of 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', I kind of just stopped caring about the franchise, even though the subsequent two movies were actually very good (the aforementioned 'X-Men: First Class' and then 'The Wolverine'). That being said, I was still looking forward to 'Days Of Future Past', what with it being the return of the old 'X-Men' crew, and I was also moderately familiar with the 'Days Of Future Past' comic. I was just expecting it to be good though, but it turns out not only is 'Days Of Future Past' the best X-Men movie yet, it's also one of the best comic-book movies ever made.<br/><br/>In 'Days Of Future Past', the X-Men of the future are facing extinction due to the sentinels which threaten to wipe them all out. They send Wolverine back in time to 1973 where he must recruit Professor X, Magneto and Mystique in order to change the course of history so that the X-Men may survive.<br/><br/>First things first, this is a time travel movie, and time travel movies normally either go very well or very badly. 'Days Of Future Past' marks an occasion where it goes very well, as the time travel logic in this movie is very well thought out and makes perfect sense, I can't pick any holes in it. This movie even manages to validate 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', which is something that I thought could never be done. It even feels weird just saying that, because righting the wrongs that those movies made is a huge, monumental task, yet this movie pulls it off perfectly.<br/><br/>For a movie that's crowded with so many characters, it's surprising that all of the characters included feel meaningful and aren't shoehorned in. We have Hugh Jackman returning as Wolverine, and there's not much to say about him that hasn't already been said. He is Wolverine, the role is made for him and he absolutely owns it. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are incredible as Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr respectively, their characters have an amazing relationship and the two of them are just phenomenal at pulling it off. We also have the future X-Men cast with the like of Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan and Ellen Page, and while they have a lot less screen time they're still great. I was surprised at how prominent a role Jennifer Lawrence had as Mystique, over the past few months I've had a growing dislike towards Jennifer Lawrence but I can't deny that she is great in this role. Then we have all of the new characters, like Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), Bishop (Omar Sy) and Blink (Bingbing Fan), all of whom are great. But there is one new character who is greater than all, and that character is Quicksilver.<br/><br/>Quicksilver in this movie is perfect. In fact, it's worth seeing this movie just for him. He doesn't have a huge amount of screen time and it comes fairly early on in the movie, but he is the best part of this film by far. There is one particular sequence with him in a kitchen, and it is jaw-droppingly beautiful. The visuals in the scene are gorgeous, the music is perfect, and it's both hilarious and stunning. The way that Quicksilver's super speed effect has been done is amazing. Some people thought the costume looked goofy, but I think it works perfectly well considering the time period and the personality of the character. I've been a big fan of Evan Peters for a while, and he is great in the role, he is very entertaining and has a great screen presence. I never thought I'd be saying this, but I doubt Marvel will be able to produce a better Quicksilver in 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' than the one that's on display here.<br/><br/>But you know what I think all this great quality comes down to? Bryan Singer. I'm pretty sure Bryan Singer is just the perfect X-Men director. Even though up until now I thought 'X-Men: First Class' was the best of the X-Men franchise, it didn't really feel like the X-Men in the way that 'X-Men' and 'X2′ did. 'Days Of Future Past' nails that X-Men dynamic while still being an exceptionally good movie. Part of that X-Men dynamic comes from John Ottman's amazing score, as it's so good to finally hear his X-Men theme again.The action scenes are incredible, especially the opening one which uses some of the new mutant powers phenomenally, especially Blink's. The movie is very well paced, I never grew bored and I didn't want it to end.<br/><br/>'Days Of Future Past' also surprisingly has a lot of very funny humour in it, but it's not humour that's just forced in for the sake of it, it all feel natural and within the confines of these characters. This film nails the comic book movie aspect; it has a plot which is clearly very serious yet it is still silly enough to remain a comic book film, unlike movies like 'Man Of Steel' and 'The Dark Knight' which go so dark that they just completely ditch the comic book aspect. There are also a few nice references that fans of the comics will get, which is just a small example of the great fan service this movie does for readers of the 'X-Men' comics.<br/><br/>'Days Of Future Past' made me remember why I was such a big X-Men fan. It rekindled my love for the characters and story lines, and like I said above, it's one of the best comic book movies ever made."
"bandobutt","10","174","272","20 May 2014"," Superb In Every Way!
","Days of Future Past continues the work of X2 as genre-defining. I have to classify it as a work of art/comic book pulp fiction. The characters, effects, and story are outstanding. Everything in this movie is exceedingly better in the sequel then even the first two films and First Class. Like X2, the acting is superb and the dialogue is rich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and bigotry only add to the depth of this film. What's better then its predecessor X3 in every way. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that's been absent from far too many of most alleged blockbusters.<br/><br/>This film is far more sophisticated and has a better story than any X-Men movie to date. Here, the characters previously introduced but under used are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner, and the newly introduced characters are blended in seamlessly with the story. The music is very good as is the special effects. The budget clearly hit the screen fully and there are truly some amazing sequences to behold. The cast-selection is still perfect.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the best genre films of all-time."
"bthivet","8","163","264","13 May 2014"," A new kind of super heroes movies (sorry for English mistakes)
","As a well known director one says, to make a great movie, you have to (as a director) believe your movie is the best ever made. In today's blockbuster standards, we do not see that at all. What I see when I watch a Marvel/Disney movie (just for the example), I feel as a spectator that directors want to make an entertainment movie, with an absolutely needs of huge action and explosion scenes, with a crescendo structure ending with a KABOOM (what an illustration^^). That's great, that make good blockbusters – but not great. I had high expectations with this movie, and yet I am not an X-Men fan and Bryan singer disappointed me a lot of times - but the trailer gave me chills and as French, I really wanted to see Omar Sy in a super-production (stupid but true). <br/><br/>Anyway, after seeing it, with 2500 X-Men fan in Paris, I was divided. In fact, I expected something else entirely. There is some plot holes, monotonous parts However, after thought a lot about it, I have to say that is a masterpiece in super heroes' movies. Why? Because it is very different from what we see today, we are not waiting for a finale with explosions, characters just keep moving so the finale do not overdo it but is still very impressive visually. Plus, this movie is very human paradoxically: it speaks about usual mutants themes, but the very point of the movie is can we change, whether it be the past or our vision of the present. The intelligence of the movie is not to focus on changing the past but on writing the present. <br/><br/>But the most important thing that makes this movie great is that Bryan Singer loves this franchise and more than making a great blockbuster, he wanted to make a great movie relying on the characters. He was convinced of making the best movie ever and even if it is not the case, I felt it, so despite all is defaults, X-MEN DAYS OF THE FUTURE PAST is a great movie, maybe, one of the best super-hero movies ever made. <br/><br/>I advise you to stay till the end of the credits, the scene is just awesome."
"nerdingsince1996","9","99","158","21 May 2014"," Best of all xmen movies
","simply said it was well directed and well acted with good pacing,great cgi effects and epic soundtrack. what more can you expect from a superhero movie? X-Men might be my favorite superhero movie (except wolverine spin off), and DOFP might be the best of them. It's an all star movie with a good director (everything not related to professionalism is irrelevant), in paper it's guaranteed to be at least a decent movie,and boy, they didn't disappoint me at all, really surpassed my expectation.<br/><br/>I am absorbed, nothing else matter except the scenes in front of me.It already had my attention since the overview of the future narrated by professor X. The story has a good pacing,not to slow but not to fast. I didn't notice any plot holes, and there's nothing in the script that annoyed me. Bryan Singer could handle the dramatic and epic scenes very well. the dramatic scenes makes me teared up a little,the epic scenes put me on the edge of my seat. And he sew the humor seamlessly, it was appropriate and subtle,just what I like.<br/><br/>They said that DOFP lack of any definitive villains, but any movie doesn't need definitive villains to be good. X-Men movies is always about fighting the enemy inside every humans and mutants, it's always about self struggle, defeating the darkness inside of you.<br/><br/>4/5 (cause nothing's perfect)"

Your mind will be blown. I've already seen this movie and looking forward to see it again. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman does the best wolverine ever. He became the wolverine i wanted to see on screen for ages. The interesting chemistry between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender is more enjoyable than ever. But jennifer lawrence and Evan Peters at Quicksilver steal the movie. Quicksilver may not look so cool but he is the coolest guy in the whole movie. <br/><br/>Believe me, this movie is worth your bucks. Moreover there are a bunch of new x men characters introduced in the movie which make it more enjoyable.Bryan Singer has done complete justice to this movie. And there is one scene just halfway through the movie which is worth watching fifty times. I am thoroughly excited to see the next entry entry in series which is being called Apocalypse.<br/><br/>The only shortcoming in the movie is the runtime which feels a little less being only 130 mins. Rest of the movie is a jigsaw which fits together in a wondrous puzzle.<br/><br/>So you must go to see this movie. Every element is in a balanced form. Even the soundtrack is fitting. <br/><br/>Happy watching !!!!"
"holifeno","9","140","234","13 May 2014"," A great Xmen movie
","The Parisian premiere was yesterday and therefore, I actually did see the movie and let me tell you this: all the waiting and fuss around this movie is well worth it and well deserved. It is a great movie, easily relatable in many ways.<br/><br/>I won't say a word about the acting. When you have established actors such as McAvoy — who repeatedly stole the screen with his heart-clenching performance — and Fassbender, along with their older 'counterparts' — McKellen and Stewart — you are in for a treat when it comes to the acting performance itself. No surprise there.<br/><br/>This movie is a great movie in the sense that it finds its source in the very core of humanity's struggles, and shows that Xmen's themes — much like Marvel's latest movies — are still very relevant in the world today. You will see that yourself.<br/><br/>The movie is action packed. There is no irrelevant scenes — I tend to judge movies by the ratio of irrelevant scenes per minute in it — and there is no break between action scenes and more emotional, storyline scenes. You won't be bored. <br/><br/>But along with the action, and the acting, there is also the usual dose of humor found in most Marvel movies, without being out of place and without cutting the pace of the movie in itself. There, Hugh Jackman will provide you with a few laughs, or at least, will bring a smile to your face.<br/><br/>The cinematography in itself was excellent. Excellent use of the 3D. Great camera work — at some point, you will be rather amazed by the use of slow mo and 3D.<br/><br/>So, why not 10 out of 10 then? Because of the score. If the soundtrack was good, it didn't match what I got used to with the recent Marvel movies. Good score but not as good as I expected it to be. Maybe it was because we were all more focused on the fast-paced action scenes and the storyline in itself rather than whatever was playing behind. I might need to go back and watch it again once it's out for general public to really appreciate the little details that I might have missed in a cinema filled with excited fans.<br/><br/>But over all, it was an excellent, entertaining and relevant Xmen movie. A good movie. A great Xmen movie. Full of Easter eggs for more hardcore fans as well. The waiting was worth it."

No: every single character is perfectly represented,interpreted (in particularly with a stunning James McAvoy and an impressive Michael Fassbender) and useful to the story. Maybe the plot then ? No: you'll get easily into it, because it is very well written for the screen, meaning you will be transported as Bryan Singer seems to know perfectly how to put in place a very cinematic puzzle. Emotions ? You will get some, as long as you loved the original X-Men characters. The soundtrack ? It is spotless and superbly fitting. Visual Effects ?

You'll be amazed, thrilled and captivated when you will realize that every single scene has a purpose, whether it has some action or simple emotions and character's development.<br/><br/>All these qualities put together are forming a very classical but excellent & accomplished movie, completed by a skilled sense of cinematic continuity that we didn't have since Singer left the franchise (at least until X-Men First Class). In other words, you should not be afraid to see this movie, because if you don't want to be disappointed, I can tell : you won't be. <br/><br/>But is the future of this X-Men movie truly set ?

"BrentHankins","9","77","126","21 May 2014"," Sets a new high-water mark for the franchise.
","After the disappointing and directionless X3: The Last Stand and the  abysmal X-Men Origins: Wolverine, prospects for the continuation of the  franchise had gone from great to grim in just a few short years.  Desperate to breathe life back into the series, 20th Century Fox turned  to director Bryan Singer to help right the ship, and although Singer  didn't return to the director's chair, he oversaw production of X-Men:  First Class, an origin story centered on the friendship between Charles  Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) in their  early years.  A critical and commercial success, First Class set the stage for an  expanded X-Men universe featuring younger versions of the mutant  superheroes, but many fans still clamored for more adventures featuring  the original cast. With Singer back at the helm, X-Men: Days of Future  Past aims to balance precariously between the two, giving the original  on screen mutants one last chance to shine, while simultaneously  pushing the younger generation forward, and fixing a few glaring  continuity errors along the way.  The film opens with a tremendous action sequence in the near future,  where an army of mutant-hunting robots called Sentinels have driven the  X-Men underground. This sequence of events was set into motion some 50  years earlier, when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Bolivar  Trask, a military scientist and anti-mutant activist whose experimental  Sentinel program would only be accelerated by his untimely demise.  With only a handful of their kind remaining, and their numbers  dwindling seemingly by the second, the elder Xavier (Patrick Stewart)  and Magneto (Ian McKellan) discover that Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) has  the ability to transport a person's consciousness into their younger  self. It's a painful experience, one that Xavier is far too fragile to  withstand, but thanks to his innate healing ability, Wolverine (Hugh  Jackman) is the perfect candidate to be sent back to alter the events  that led to the destruction of the mutant race.  Waking up in his 1973 body, Wolverine is tasked with tracking down and  reuniting Xavier and Lensherr to stop the assassination of Trask. Easy  enough, right? Unfortunately, Xavier has become a bitter, reclusive  alcoholic, wasting away in his mansion with his only remaining friend,  Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), while Lensherr is incarcerated in the most  secure building in the United States after being implicated in the  death of President Kennedy. After all, as Xavier puts it, ""who else  could curve a bullet?""  Getting Lensherr out of trouble is a seemingly impossible task, but  Wolverine knows a guy. That guy is the young Pietro Maximoff, better  known as Quicksilver (Evan Peters), and his handful of scenes are some  of the most entertaining moments in the film, particularly an escape  sequence that conveys his super-speed abilities by shooting at 3000  frames per second. There have been glimpses of this moment during the  film's trailers, but the scene as a whole is staggeringly beautiful,  and the character's bizarre sense of humor provides a sense of joy and  playfulness that are noticeably absent from the rest of the film.  That's not to say X-Men: Days of Future Past is not enjoyable - on the  contrary, it's a thrilling experience from start to finish, with plenty  of emotional resonance to go along with all the action and special  effects. Jackman's performance is less growling menace and more wise  mediator, adding yet another dimension to an already complex character.  McAvoy and Fassbender still have remarkable chemistry, but the film  truly belongs to Lawrence, whose ability to emote through layers of  body paint and prosthetics makes Mystique more relatable than ever  before.  While it's a shame that most of the original X-Men cast are relegated  to cameos, those minor appearances tend to come during jaw-dropping  action scenes. The futuristic battles between the Sentinels and the  last remaining mutants are a joy to behold, with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore)  finally using his abilities in ways that fans have always wanted to  see, and newcomers like Blink (Fan Bingbing) and Bishop (Omar Sy)  getting an opportunity to kick ass alongside the veterans.  There are also plenty of references to the previous X-Men films, as  Days of Future Past attempts to bridge the gap between the original  trilogy and the reboot. William Stryker (Josh Helman) is a looming  presence throughout the film, with his work evoking images of the  Weapon X program, and the final moments are full of fan service cameos  that effectively close the book on the original characters. For the  most part, it succeeds, and while there are still a few questions  remaining, there's so much to love here that the minor details no  longer feel relevant.  X-Men: Days of Future Past is a return to form for Singer, whose  directorial efforts since the first two films have been rather poorly  received. His emotional connection to the material and his love for the  characters has never been more evident, and the X-Men have never been  more compelling or entertaining. This latest installment proves there's  still plenty of life left in the franchise, and we can't wait to see  what comes next when the mutants return in 2016.  -- Brent Hankins"

","Talk about a rise and fall and rebirth of a franchise. If you're around my age than the big superhero franchises that we soaked in were the Raimi's Spider-Man films, Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, and of course the X-Men movies. Overall, I can honestly say that I really love this series. Origins: Wolverine, is certainly a low point and while The Last Stand was no where near the awesomeness and greatness that was Bryan Singer's first 2 films, it's still a fairly entertaining action movie. First Class was (before yesterday) my favorite X-Men movie, and even THE Wolverine was an awesome and gritty and much needed different take on an X-Men story. I literally grew up with this movie franchise, so I guess you can say I was extremely hyped when I sat down in the theater for DOFP.<br/><br/>You start off with a Terminator like intro, the first 10 minutes of this movie had some of the strongest and haunting scenes I've ever seen in a comic book movie. Humans AND mutants are on a losing side of a tragic war against the genocidal, Sentinels. A group of X-Men, led by Patrick Stewart's, Prof. X and Ian McKellen's, Magneto. They have a last hope idea of sending someone back to the point in time, where these Sentinel's were created. With his ability to heal and agelessness, Wolverine offers his services to travel back to 1972, to try to reunite the torn friendship between young Magneto and Prof. X, and band together to prevent this horrible war from happening.<br/><br/>My god, what a rush this movie was. I don't think I had this sense of wonder watching a comic book movie since The Dark Knight Rises premiered. The eerie opening got me by surprise, but it worked. It perfectly showed us the audience, just how serious and catastrophic this battle with The Sentinels is. So from the start I'm hooked, then we get into this crazy plan hatched up that sends Wolverine to the 70's and get a bit more lighter, but then we see James McAvoy in a terrific performance as young and troubled Charles Xavier, Jennifer Lawrence being as hot and more bad ass than ever as Mystique, and of course Michael Fassbender as the multi-layered Magneto. Everyone's performance in this movie was utilized so good. Oscar winner Halle Berry has minimal dialog, but her presence was felt, Ellen Page, Peter Dinklage, and Evan Peters all aren't front and center a lot, but they give it their all every minute they're on screen, which makes the dramatic tension so powerful especially when you see certain characters die or get injured. Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine as usual, but in a different way, as opposed to past films. Here, Wolverine is a much more centered guy, who really wants to help everyone. He even agrees to think happy thoughts to keep his mind from bursting by traveling through space-time. <br/><br/>You would think a movie THIS packed with story, characters, and action, that'd the movie would get lost and tumble over it's own weight and I can't tell you happy I am that it doesn't. You're never once lost as to what's going on, what needs to be done, and how everything got to where it is. The story is played out rather well. Each character and actor has the perfect amount of screen time for what it is their character's are needed for. Quicksilver is a perfect example, he stole every scene he was in, and while he's here and gone pretty swiftly, it gives other more important characters their time to shine. You gotta give it up to the writers and the absolutely terrific direction of Mr. Bryan Singer. <br/><br/>Just hearing the X-Men theme song playing during the begging made my eyes tear, this movie really brought the X-Men back to greatness. The special effects were spot on, my favorite scene even outshining the big stadium scene was, Quicksilver's kitchen run. The combination of music, humor, effects, and practical effects worked to summer blockbuster perfection. The design on the Sentinel's were OK, I wasn't blown away by them as they reminded me a lot of the giant robot guard from the first Thor movie. The setting of 1970's Washington makes for some pretty nice looking sets and sequences and the future scenes were awesome. The action is filmed so well and the powers of the mutants make the action just the kind of jaw dropping eye candy I've been wanting. <br/><br/>This is one of the best movie I've seen all year, it may have even beaten out Captain America: The Winter Soldier as my favorite comic book movie of the year. The action, acting, and story are exceeded my expectations. I really believe the hype and I see why people are rushing back for another viewing, this is a fantastic movie and I give it my highest recommendation. This movie was a Cineadventure."
"Amari-Sali","8","24","36","24 May 2014"," With beautiful special effects, and a good enough story to spend a little more than 2 hours with, while it may lack emotional punch, it is undeniably entertaining.
","My love for the X-Men was not born due to the comics, or even the cartoons, it was the video games. So, off the bat, let me say while I may know characters faces, and a bit about their background, largely I am quite oblivious to the various universes and stories. So walking in I didn't know much besides fairly recent news stories dealing with Rogue's part being cut, to Kitty seemingly being the one who was supposed to go to the past. Outside of that though, I was a clean slate. Making the movie quite the experience, even if sometimes confusing and surely with details lacking.<br/><br/>Characters & Story<br/><br/>Sometime in the future, the sentinels have almost completed a genocide of not only living mutants, but those who would be the mothers/ fathers, or even grandparents of them. Not only that, mutant allies are killed. But, there remains hope. Said hope is entrusted in Logan/ Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who, through Kitty Pride (Ellen Page), is sent 50 years back in time to try to make the reconciliation of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy/ Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender/ Ian McKellen) happen far before both are senior citizens.<br/><br/>Along this journey though, there is a need to address Mystique's (Jennifer Lawrence) position in all that happens, as she seems integral in either the destruction, or salvation, of mutant kind. All because of her interactions with one man: Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). The precursor to William Stryker (Josh Helman), who may not hate mutants, but surely is aware that with their rise comes mankind becoming obsolete, or downsized in the grand scheme of things. So, live or die, that is Mystque's decision, and with Logan having a limited time to change the past, catching and changing the mind of a highly illusive woman, with Xavier's help of course, is quite the task.<br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>With this being a Marvel movie, especially X-Men, the biggest bit of praise first has to go to the special effects team. Between the fights against the sentinels, the transformations of Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and Mystque, as well as watching all mutants involved exhibiting their powers to varying degrees, it left me in awe enough to forget to take down notes at times. Also, as most Marvel movies have, there is a good use of humor, though it unfortunately isn't seen throughout but only in certain sections. Quicksilver (Evan Peters), for example, probably left the biggest impression on me because his interactions with Logan, Magneto and Xavier were hilarious, and definitely a highlight of the film. Peters way of delivering lines almost seemed Deadpool like.<br/><br/>But, if you were to focus just on the story, and set aside the special effects and jokes, I'm slightly sad to say that the veterans do a far better job at bringing some sense of emotion to the story than the newcomers. Naturally, the genuine friendship between Sir Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart makes the Magneto/ Professor X saga more than some re-imagined Malcolm X vs. Martin Luther King Jr. Their complicated history is masterfully crafted by McKellan and Stewart to the point they eclipse the other actors for their performances have various degrees of emotion, while everyone else seemingly only exhibit fear or self- loathing.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>And with that said, being someone who increasingly has watched Marvel films, I have to say I found it odd that the film with the largest amount of misfits, and those that have suffered, didn't lead to stronger performances. Which isn't to say they weren't good, though more so adequate, but perhaps with McKellen and Stewart there, using their veteran experience on how you could get a point, or feeling, across without overdoing it, in comparison it just makes the other actors look just good enough. Take for example the two major relationships in the movie: Young Xavier and Magneto, and Young Xavier and Mystique. Considering all that happens in the past is what is supposed to build toward the future, be it lost chemistry, or perhaps too many special effects to take into consideration, I found it hard to get lost in characters interacting and sensing a serious connection between them. Making it where the film leaped from past to present, it was like dealing with a bright enough light bulb to one which was luminous.<br/><br/>Which to me was weird since in First Class there was good chemistry. But in this film there lacks consistency. Like a flickering light bulb you know you just put in, you know what should happen, and that it worked in the past, but don't understand why things aren't working now. And while I must note time constraints make it so long heart to hearts aren't possible in the film, I do feel like this was perhaps one of the few Marvel films, for me, which probably focused more the action and effects than it did characters and the story.<br/><br/>Overall: Worth Seeing<br/><br/>Though I must admit I felt a bit disappointed that the movie lacked a sense of heart, the drama of impending doom, watching Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart interact, as well as seeing all my favorite mutants, push this toward being a ""Worth Seeing."". For really, what comic book movie is really trying to aim for Oscar nominations? They are purely aimed at entertaining and keeping the franchise's name out there. And while I feel this film may not inspire someone to develop further knowledge of the X-Men universe to spoil the sequel, it is certainly good enough to keep you loyal."

","Ahhh the X-men Franchise.There's the good: X-men, X2 and x-men first class and the bad: X3, god dammit Brett Ratner.But with a familiar face returning to the franchise Its easy to say the franchise is being brought to life and exceeding new levels with Days of future past.So as always I will rank this art film as 1.Acting, 2.Plot, 3.Sfx and 4.Flaws, 5:Direction.<br/><br/>1:The acting:The acting was superb.Hugh Jackman is as good as always playing the 6 foot 3 Canadian with anger issues.Micheal Fassbender and especially James McAvoy gave praising performances as the younger counterparts of Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen.Micheal Fassbender shows how cold and calculating Magneto is making him the bad-ass super villain.James McAvoy gave a shuddering performance as a broken down Charles Xavier who's lost his way.Evan Peters was great as the speedy quicksilver(I doubt avengers 2 quicksilver will beat this one)who stole the show for the part he was given.Jennifer Lawrence was also good as the troubled Mystique.10/10 2.The Plot:In 2023, the mutants face the biggest threat yet:the sentinels, which are mutant killing robots made by Bolivar Trask, 50 years ago.The sentinels are so advanced that they adapt to any mutant power.So what do they have to do to stop the massacre?They have to send the Wolverine back to the past to change the future.Sounds good right?10/10 3.SFX:The GCI was simply stunning.The sentinels (both future and past)looked amazing.The mutant powers were awe strucking(especially quicksilver's superhuman speed).10/10 4.Flaws:Although the X-men franchise is pretty flawed some things were explained.Like how Charles could walk.How Hank Mcoy was still human in X2.But some questions remain unanswered.Like did Logan ever undergo the weapon X procedure?How is professor X still alive?Well we still have X-men:Apocalypse coming up so they might be awnsered.9/10 5.The direction:After 3 blockbuster movies, it really shows how Bryan Singer knows how this team of outcasts functions(Not you, Brett Ratner).He really knows how this team works and there's heart in this film (unlike the Avengers).There's a right amount of action, dialog and emotion to this film.Worth buying.<br/><br/>Overall:10/10.This flick is a perfect blend of everything.Even if your-re not a fan of superhero movies this one is still going to surpass your expectations.Its worth it.Cant wait for Apocalypse, Bryan Singer."

"FisheyFilms","5","99","179","22 May 2014"," Some great highlights, a lot of disappointment.
","*Spoilers*<br/><br/>I tried not to get myself hyped up too much with this film because when Matthew Vaughn left I was pretty bummed out. I loved First Class and the new feel that X-Men had, I was really looking forward to him carrying that on. Unfortunately, Bryan Singer took over. Even with this lowered expectation, I found myself sitting in the cinema multiple times thinking 'Ok we get it, we understand what is at risk here, please lets get on with it!'. <br/><br/>To start with the good points.<br/><br/>The opening - visually amazing and the film was off to a great start. Blink was my favourite of this sequence, her powers of portals were used in really creative ways and kept the action flowing well.<br/><br/>I didn't think I would like Quicksilver at all but I found all the scenes he was in to be extremely entertaining and gave the film the comic book feeling again. You know, that feeling of just enough realism to make it believable yet enough humour to add the fun comic book side of things? He was that in spades and I found my self disappointed when he didn't join up with the X-Men for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The actors. It was great to such an ensemble on screen and I'd even go as far as saying the young Charles (James McAvoy) stole the show, with the young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) a close second.<br/><br/>There were some nice little nods to most of the other X-Men films and it was good to see all the tie-ins. Also the very few humorous parts, one which comes to mind is when Wolverine walks through the metal detector and it doesn't beep. He looks back in confusion, expecting it to go off. These were great but were far to few.<br/><br/>Now for the not so good points.<br/><br/>Repetition. How many times do we need to hear 'We need to stop Mystique or it's the end of all mutants!?' in some form or another. You see this visually in the past with the older X-Men getting killed off. You don't need to keep telling the audience this as it's what we're seeing! Also, 'Mystique's DNA is the key', 'They can't get Mystique's DNA or else (you guessed it), it's the end of all mutants!'. This got old really quickly and unfortunately I came out of the theatre more frustrated than anything, forgetting the good parts that I liked.<br/><br/>Hollywood seems to think scripts don't matter nearly as much anymore, thinking it can be covered up by fabulous special effects. This is not the case at all and I hope writers are allowed to be more creative instead of getting creativity and risk taking shut down by the suits sitting in their offices.<br/><br/>Lack of action. We're watching this film for over two hours and the best action sequences you get is at the beginning! The ending sequences would have appealed to me a lot more if I hadn't been so frustrated with the script for over half the film.<br/><br/>All and all, this is a must watch film - but I'll only be seeing it the once. Singer, please pass the torch on to someone else and get the fresh feeling back that was First Class."
"sorednax3","5","48","82","24 May 2014"," Shut Up and Eat Your Popcorn (contains spoilers)
","I think that pretty much sums up the execs attitude when making this film. <br/><br/>Great cast, excellent performances, spot on effects. Too bad the script was dog food. <br/><br/>Lets start with the end of Xmen Last stand. Professor Xavier is killed right? Well the post credit scene suggests his consciousness survived. Although, we hear his voice, we don't actually see him (Patrick Stewart) cause it would be a whole new body, yes? Next comes Xmen Origins: Wolverine and First Class, nothing that ties this together. While X3 does close the book, it seems, on Scott and Jean, the fate of Charles Xavier is an unresolved issue. Third film comes in, the Wolverine, and again nothing...except, wait. The return of Magneto and Professor X. Wolverine is as stunned by this as we're supposed to be. But it eludes to the upcoming DoFP. So we open in a dystopian future where, ta da, there's Charles. No explanation or anything. 8 years and 4 films, and they fail to resolve this issue. By the way, that Wolverine end scene was as if that never happened, because DoFP takes place 8-10 years later.<br/><br/>I also found it a contrived plot device that time moves in sync, essentially time passes minute by minute in the past for wolverine as it does in the future. Ergo, Logan ages six hours in 1972, he ages six hours in the future (guesstimated at 2022). I would conservatively put Logan's sojourn into the past to be roughly a week. So for one week solid kitty pride is kneeling over him doing the time-phase thing the ENTIRE TIME. I guess she doesn't need to eat, sleep, or poop. Lets also not forget there are a dozen mutants just hanging out all this time. In a world of super sentinels, you'd think they would want to stay mobile, keep moving. <br/><br/>I'd like to know, wtf happened to the world to have a future like that, cause I must of blinked and missed it. X3 and the wolverine left the world in a good place for humans and mutants. Then ker-pow, now we use robots from the 70s? Funny, sentinels were never mentioned in the original films, save for a make believe scenario in the danger room in X3. Yet here they are. In fact, in the year 2000, it seemed the world was just waking up to the idea of mutants. Ohhh that's right, apparently as of now NONE OF THOSE FILMS EVER HAPPENED. <br/><br/>I guess wolverine never gets his adamantium then. Ohhh wait, how did he have adamantium claws in the future when he lost them in the Wolverine?<br/><br/>Xavier suddenly being alive is never explained. The serum he uses to walk again is horribly contrived. It's supposed to explain why we see him walking around in the flashback sequence in X3, as well as the cameo in Origins, but fails. He can walk at the expense of losing his powers. Well, he used them in X3 and Origins. And even so, if the serum later got ""perfected"", why wouldn't he use it all the time then? Furthermore, if the serum repaired his back, it did nothing for what happened to him at the end of this film where the steel beam crushes his legs. <br/><br/>While seeing certain characters fully realized (iceman using his ice- slide), the film lost its soul. What made the original films so great where how the characters connected with the audience, the social/moral implications of being ""different"", and the whole judgement, acceptance, and belonging that was such a heavy element to these films has been watered down into movie action schlock. If this film had any real emotional weight, it would of been all those characters in First Class being killed off by the government and the horrible experiments they performed on them. But since this happened off camera and just given a mere mention in this film, the audience is significantly less impacted. ""awww, why they have to go and kill off Banshee?"" vs, ""OMG, you mother ******s, how could you? Avenge him!!!""<br/><br/>Although the original films were always set in ""the near future"" there were never any elements that made it seem too futuristic. Like the 3d map in the first film, nothing like that existed but it was easy to see us progressing there. In other words, the world felt very real, grounded, believable. Now, it's 8-10 years after X3, and we got giant lasers, space ships, a re-imagined NYC skyline, etc. Like aliens in an Indiana Jones film, these things felt out of place. Then, we use Sentimels, which is far beyond our current technology and have them first invented in 1972? So before we even have the same technology that brought us Atari and cassette players, we have advance cybernetic hunter/killer robots? I get how putting metal in them while they were being shipped allowed Magneto to use his mutant power on them, but doesn't explain how he was able to reprogram them. He talks and they obey him, makes no sense....ahhhhh shut up and eat your popcorn. <br/><br/>Ohhh, one last thing: Dear studio execs, please consider your largest demographic when choosing which characters bare butt to show off."
"fpurify","4","67","119","25 May 2014"," The Matrix + The Terminator + Back To The Future (with Mutants)
","I won't disparage anyone for what they find enjoyable. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. That being said, here is mine...<br/><br/>The hallmark of an intellectually insulting film is when, early in the movie, each of the main characters stands around in a single room reciting one-liners that give away the entire plot. That happens about five minutes into Days of Future Past and serves as a staggering reminder that this ultimately is a movie for kids.<br/><br/>Along the same vein, it would take the film watching experience of a child to not recognize that DOFP is basically an unoriginal mash-up of better films that came before it (the most obvious ripoffs being Back to the Future, Terminator 2, and The Matrix).<br/><br/>In fact, DOFP is nothing more than a mutant version of Back to the Future, with fewer memorable lines, mediocre acting (save for the always excellent Michael Fassbender), without the classic soundtrack, and with no real villain.<br/><br/>**Spoiler Alert** Plot Synopsis: The Matrix, I mean, DOFP, starts with the all-powerful Sentinels having basically destroyed civilization and terrorizing the mutants who remain in Zion, I mean whatever city they live in. Withing five minutes, we find out that a mutant has the ability to allow others to time travel, but that the farther back in time someone travels, the more difficult it is for Ellen Page to hold it all together. Of course, Wolverine is the only one who is strong enough to make the trip. Why are they time traveling? The Terminator, I mean, Wolverine, has to see to it that Sarah Connor, I mean, Raven/Mystique, doesn't kill The Brother From Another Planet, I mean Joe Morton, I mean the guy who creates Sentinels. What else happens in the movie? Nothing of consequence. A lot of running around, chasing, breaking into stuff, and a melodramatic half love-story involving an apparently alcoholic, depressed, and pathetic Professor X and Mystique.<br/><br/>Surely someone out there understands my POV. Again, I respect everyone's opinion, but when I googled DOFP after seeing it and saw a 8.7 rating on IMDb (plus a 91% of RT), my eyes almost fell out of my head.<br/><br/>Background/Disclaimer: I did not grow up reading comics. I occasionally watched, and enjoyed, the X-Men cartoon of the '90s. I have seen X-Men (really good), X2 (amazing), The Last Stand (disappointingly awful), and portions of First Class (no opinion)."
"terrywdhs","10","38","64","20 May 2014"," Best X Men Movie Yet With A Scene Stealing Quicksilver
","Easily the best X Men film yet with a storyline that requires you to think whilst marvelling at the amazing special effects and action scenes taking place before your eyes. James McAvoy puts in a superb performance as an embittered Professor X and there are great performances from Hugh Jackman and Michael Fassbender in their respective roles as Wolverine and Magneto but the person everyone is going to be talking about is a new mutant to the series called Quicksilver played superbly with the right amount of arrogance and likability by Evan Peters. His huge action scene where he is required to rescue an imprisoned Magneto from a heavily guarded Pentagon is an absolute delight and already a contender of most amazing action scene of the year and I cant see anything beating it. Trust me - you will want to watch this scene again and again as there is so much to marvel at. Pity that Quicksilver is absent after this as the film does sorely miss the character. Hoping to see more of him in the future. The film does have a great climax though featuring a highly inventive use of a football stadium and a post credits scene with a hint of what to expect in the next movie. All in all a great movie that is going to delight and entertain young and old alike."

","I went into this movie with high expectations so that may be the reason why I wasn't at all impressed with this film. The action was bland, short and just seemed like everything we've already seen before. The truly only great part of this movie was the scene with quicksilver and that was a really short piece of the movie. Once that scene was over the rest of the movie became this huge bore. I go to a movie like this with the usual expectation of seeing something ""new"".. well I was let down.<br/><br/>The majority of the movie was completely boring. There were only a few scenes of very mediocre action and it just seemed like they did not put a lot of effort into this movie."
"mikeymcdo","8","16","24","4 June 2014"," A brilliant addition to a very hit or miss franchise. Dare I say better than ""The Avengers""?
","I always thought the X-Men were the real deal. When everyone was praising the brilliance of The Avengers I was more preoccupied in the compelling dynamic between the 2 leads, Xavier and Magneto in X-men First Class. Despite loving ""Earths Mightiest Heroes"" the story hasn't got a lot of grit to it and is rather zany. X-Men on the other hand I find to be a lot more compelling especially through it's sub-text of societies prejudice on minorities these are highlighted specifically well in First Class and X2. <br/><br/>By taking the principal characters from both these films and bringing them together into a desperate attempt to warn the past of the atrocities of the future in Days of Future Past is a work of genius. Days of Future Past is loaded full of exceptional performances James McAvoy is superb as a young Professor who has lost his way and has withdrawn from offering guidance. Michael Fassbender's performance is magnetic quite literally...but figuratively it is a fascinating portrayal of a man determined to get his way yet still showing respect for his old friend Charles Xavier. This dynamic that has carried on from First Class really fascinates me. Yes the action scenes with the mutant side characters like Blink and Storm are very impressive but the conflicting principals of these 2 characters is the big draw to me.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian's interpretation of these characters is a much welcome return adding an element of class to the rowdiness of there youthful selves. However I wanted to see more of the desperate survival within the post apocalyptic future. A whole movie could've been done on establishing the bleak future of a world ruled by Sentinels. <br/><br/>The big poster characters of these movies Wolverine and Mystique are also great. Wolverine is a bit of a bore in his solo outings. Having him function within a team is infinitely more compelling. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique has many poignant scenes with the story hinging on her actions entirely which really raise the stakes. <br/><br/>With such an expansive cast all having a chance to shine it is a massive shame that Bryan Singer didn't direct the major let down that was X-Men 3 and Origins. It's nice that the characters act like the events never happened but it's a shame that I can't. As a standalone entry to the series X-Men Days of Future Past has a thoughtful script that doesn't rely on mindless action sequences to keep your attention. Along with it's stellar cast, this is a truly amazing installment to a messy franchise that now has a chance to develop."
"macblackslair","10","15","23","21 May 2014"," Convincing performances, fantastic cinematography in the fifth X-Men installment
","In the near future, mutants and ordinary humans alike are under attack and losing the battle. So our heroes from former installments try to prevent this war by sending Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to the past so he can fix the mess a certain blue lady (Jennifer Lawrence) is creating. In the year 1973, Wolverine meets young and depressed Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) again. Will he succeed in uniting the two mutant geniuses and change everything?<br/><br/>That said, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is a thrilling experience. The chemistry between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender is amazing, as are their performances. Again. Nicholas Hoult does a fantastic job as Hank. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, meaning he IS THE Wolverine. ""Game of Thrones"" star Peter Dinklage does a great job as Dr. Trask. And yes, I love Jennifer Lawrence as Raven. Plus, we see Ellen Page and Omar Sy, and Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are great as ever. <br/><br/>I like the performances and the acting in general. There are quite some emotional scenes. Needless to say that James McAvoy pulls them off so well it almost hurts.<br/><br/>""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" promises fun as well. Action sequences are spiced with nice effects and flavored with some humor. Evan Peters who plays Quicksilver is amazing in his role and gives you something to watch in amazing 3D.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the cinematography is fantastic. Yes, I have seen even better results, but scenes, cuts, and effects fit the movie. 3D looks and feels great.<br/><br/>Overall, I rate it as one of the best X-Men movies so far. Although I am aware of some logical gaps (considering the original X-Men movie time line), I accept ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" as a more or less alternate canon time line. By doing so, it is easy to enjoy these two hours full of mutants, their powers, and their fears."
"praveenalienstar","1","69","130","16 June 2014"," Really twisted with no sense.
","For those who would have watched all previous x-men movies, this movie will make it all go waste(except x-men first class). Actually the whole movie is based on humans capturing mystique in 1973, some years after the time in x-men first class, and using her DNA to make powerful sentinels to eliminate mutant race. Now here maybe some questions that you might think after watching the movie: 1. If Mystique was captured in 1973, how did she make an appearance in x-men 1,2,3? 2. How can Magneto control the sentinels(robots) and really large objects (A Football stadium) in 1973? 3. If the future is changed, then wolverine would never get his adamantium claws as Mystique takes her in the end of movie. So was there any sense watching x-men origins wolverine? 4. Finally, if no-one dies, than is there any sense of watching x-men 1,2,3 where many characters(Silver Fox, Scott, Jean, Stryker, etc) gets killed? Answer to all these questions is: The directors think the public is stupid and they will earn no matter what crappy story based x-men story they make."

","The X-Men send wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants. <br/><br/>To me it's a very welcome return to Bryan Singer as X-Men I and II were very good! He really captured the essence of the X-Men comic books which was as it's heart the mutant and humans struggle, politics and emotions of that. Bryan Singer returned this time, taking what Matthew Vaughn brought us with X-Men: First Class and linked the two world together in a perfectly satisfying and epic new film. This exciting summer blockbuster will satisfy fans of the series. Singer is clearly comfortable in this world once again bringing humour to it as well as incredible action. It's in fact great to see the X-Men fight together in a unique and interesting way. Plus, he exceeded people expectations (unfortunately for him though, particularly in this world where expectations are always higher), pleased, surprised and shocked them as well with X-Men I at a time when there were no genre. X-Men II, I think, for many people is a favourite of the entire series. He managed to elevate that again with Days of Future Past. This film is not only an X-Men movie but it's also a time travel movie. Which can go both way. It gives the writers and director the chance to do something that we're not expecting as they could literally pull anything out of the bag. This film might be the best X-Men movie we've ever had as Singer fixed all the mistakes made since his departure with X-Men III and Origins. It's great! However, people tend to smash those big blockbusters because of all the special effects and kids related things but this movie has on display incredible acting talent, the cast is absolutely incredible, such as Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Plus, the big stands out are Michael Fassbender and especially James McAvoy who is amazing as Professor X in far more difficult times. They have such a fantastic chemistry, we can feel the endless amount of back stories in place within those characters. Yes, there are many characters in this film which is pretty easy to mess up with. We've seen that recently, for instance in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 which handled his characters terribly. But here, every single one of these characters having really awesome bad ass fight scenes and cool comic book moments, have emotional arcs as well. Undeniably the emotional core of the movie is intact from the beginning. One of the best sequences involved Evan Peters as Quicksilver, trust me as I say that he steels every moments he's on the screen. Every scenes he's in it, not a whole bunch, but still every scene is PERFECT. When he's demonstrating his powers, is actually one of the best scene I have ever seen in a comic book film in my (short) entire life. Finally, only a couple of minor issue including on the one hand little to much silly humour, but I have to admit that it's part of the series. Sometimes humour was extremely clever throughout the movie, characters did jokes and it works. On the other hand there were to little time spent on worthy character such as Dr. Bolivar Trask. Indeed, Peter Dinklage is an amazing actor but he didn't really strike the fear and intensity that I was hoping from him, as we didn't really know what are his motivations to exterminate mutants by creating the Sentinel. The character of Bishop also disappointed me as he doesn't look like the comics in any way. X-Men: Days of Future Past represents a great conclusion as well as a fresh beginning for the next films to come. <br/><br/>Overall, even if you're not an X-Men fan despite just the fantasy and spectacle, the story is so deeply human and moving that I feel like everyone has to relate to this franchise. As you could tell by now I'm a huge fan of Marvel universe. I loved X-Men DOFP and of course I'm really looking forward to Apocalypse, more than ever before!"

","As if the third film in the original X-Men trilogy weren't execrable enough, this one takes the only decent X-film -- First Class -- and casually murders the popular cast of characters, which is referred to obliquely in the film's first hour. This is done to motivate Magneto, since of course he's never experienced the death of anyone dear to him before. It's not like he lived through the Holocaust or anything.<br/><br/>Never once is anything explained, most notably how a dwarf with absolutely no powers but wooden acting managed to capture and murder them in the first place. And of course, that character must not die, at all costs. Because we really want to save this hideous abomination of a timeline?<br/><br/>The story is ludicrous, even for a superhero film, and it's acted and delivered about as poorly as one might expect. It's impossible to invest oneself in, and even the attempt at historical trappings are pathetic. Either they're shoehorned 'hey-it's-the-se-ven-ties!' references (which tend to be anachronistic anyway) or they're half-arsed, and that's being generous.<br/><br/>If you liked any of the X-Men films, and especially if you liked First Class, steer far away from this. It doesn't make any sense (Xavier can walk but can't use his powers becaaaause of the same serum that turns Hank McCoy into a blue Beast?) and doesn't respect its audience (Pietro is reimagined as 'Peter' and is about as annoying as you could imagine), but more than that, it doesn't respect the source material in the comics or the previous films.<br/><br/>This film does 3D well. That is its only positive. It has the distinction of being the first and only film I have not been able to finish in the theatre, for which I walked out and demanded a refund.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the X-Men, do not see this movie. If you are a fan of the comics, do not see this movie. If you liked the previous films, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU EVER SEE THIS MOVIE.<br/><br/>This may sound like hyperbole, but it's not. I have sat through patently terrible films, but they also were films without huge budgets and actors who should know better, not to mention directors who really need to hang it up. If this was the best they could do...it's time to just stop."

","They should stop calling these movies X-men. It should just be called Wolverine. I hate what they have done to x-men. Bishop is in the movie for maybe 5 min and the story is about going back in time. If your the type of person that has no knowledge of the X-men universe and just want to have a good time watching a movie you may have enjoyed it, but you were robbed. You were robbed of what the X-men really are and that is complex characters with richer struggles and woe. They have failed to illustrate all the love triangles and created ones that simply don't exist. I just don't know what to say anymore. I see this movie has a good rating. I don't think i can trust the rating system here any longer."
"billygoat1071","6","14","22","23 May 2014"," Saving The Future
","The timeline of the X-Men movie franchise has been troubling ever since the supposedly conclusion of the series, X-Men: The Last Stand. The studio continues to make more of these by telling each of the mutants' origin stories, but it wasn't quite a success due to leading to a grope of making two awful Wolverine movies and a main prequel that doesn't know where to go afterwards. A solution to fix this is simply time-travel. With all the space time continuum and stuff, it finally has the chance to amend the universe and unhappen the unwanted events of the last movies. In that way, X-Men: Days of Future Past triumphs. The movie itself does need to be a little economical in its exposition, but as a blockbuster it is quite a solid entertainment.<br/><br/>The plot isn't actually a big of an adventure as it sounds. This fact may blind the audience by the vast amount of references from the past films, astounding action scenes, and extended character work. Take all of that away, you'll just get a breezy little mission that just walks in to historic periods and places. Not saying this is a bad thing; the action scenes are in fact a huge benefit of providing real momentum, and the pathos of the main characters are also worth exploring. It's a real joy just seeing these mutants get back together again. But the weakness here is it's too drawn to nostalgia. Don't get me wrong, it is fun remembering the best parts of the old X-Men, and as a time travel movie, this is absolutely essential, but only few become helpful to the plot. The rest of them is just a fan service which doesn't always elevate the overall story.<br/><br/>Then again, the real pleasures are the basic appeal of the series. Most X-Men movies are usually more focused on Wolverine than anyone else, and this sequel might do the same. Surprisingly, it was able to juxtapose each of the major character's arc. The young Professor X and Mystique remain the most intriguing among, the script doesn't always give enough detail to it, but their actors bring the gravity they deserve. The action, once again, is pretty well done. Besides of the future scenes, it provides more than just explosions. There is a real direction going on to these sequences and the camera perfectly shows its every action which makes it totally entertaining.<br/><br/>X-Men: Days of Future Past stands as perfect as a fan service. What exactly matters in this installment is to erase what was messed up by the last few movies by taking the concept of time-travel, butterfly effect, etc. The whole film is still too burdened by the past which sometimes hinders the plot, it would have been a much compelling movie if it goes deeper within its intriguing subtext. In the end, the film still succeeds in their goal, and it is a simple one which comic book fans will definitely appreciate. Therefore congratulations, this sequel just saved this franchise's future."
"Dm86","6","9","13","21 September 2014"," Melodramatic superheros and not enough comic book action
","I've waited a long time for this one. X-Men: First Class was truly first class in my opinion, from the perspective of a comic-book-turned-movie. I thought there is no way for Days of Future Past to disappoint me, but sadly, I was wrong.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong or think I am to negative - the movie is visually great (especially the ""villains"") and the actors do their job more than well. The story is also very interesting and gripping. However, when I watch a Marvel movie, I expect action, thrills and adventure. I do like drama - but not here and definitely not that much. A bit of drama would be OK, but the levels of melodrama we get from certain characters (I don't want to spoil anything so I'll skip the name, but you'll know it when you see it) are simply not fitting for this kind of movie.<br/><br/>After some great starting sequences, my wife and I started wondering why is the movie losing pace and when will the ""real X-Men movie"" start. We rolled our eyes more than once during some scenes, although we are both huge franchise fans.<br/><br/>I give it a six because I like X-Men and it's visually great and the story is okay. But that is as high as it gets for me. Despite that, I would recommend watching it because I see some very good reviews here so I hope not all of you find it as disappointing as I did."
"Eightiesjunkie","1","22","38","10 November 2014"," Should've been titled: X-Men days of future plot holes!
","(Spoiler Warning) I'm really scratching my head on this one guys, this movie's been hailed as ""The best x-men movie ever!"" I'm sorry, but I REALLY have to disagree on this one. Before I state all the reasons why I hated this movie, let me start off with two positive comments: Hugh Jackman is still good as Wolverine, and the character of Quicksilver, was pretty cool. Now for the numerous reasons as to why I hated this film. So we start off looking at a destroyed, post apocalyptic, landscape that looks like it was ripped off from the first two Terminator movies. We then get some narration from Charles Xavier. He explains that most of the mutant population has been enslaved or killed by these killer machines known as sentinels. Then we see a small group of mutants who are both hiding, and trying to fight the sentinels. Xavier tells them that the only chance for the mutant race to survive, is to go back in time to try to prevent the assassination of a government scientist, which in turn prevents the deployment of the sentinels. So Wolverine is sent back through time, and must prevent fellow mutant Mystique, from doing the deed. You would think that a plot involving time travel would be intriguing and interesting right? Well not in this movie! There's almost no action, The actors are bland, and you couldn't care less for any of the characters! That's only the tip of the iceberg folks! What really kills it is the fact the the plot has more holes in it than a slice of Swiss cheese! Before I talk about that though, let me back up a bit. When ""X-men first class"" came out, I thought to myself: Okay cool, they're rebooting the x-men franchise and making a whole new series."" Turns out they weren't, the only reason why ""X-Men first class was made, was so that they could create a whole new continuity that they could smash together with the old continuity. The result of this, is a clusterf*cked mess! This film won't leave you feeling good or entertained, it will only leave you with a head full of questions. Such as these: Why is Xavier alive in the future, when we clearly saw him being killed by the phoenix in part 3? Why does Wolverine have bone claws in the past, but metal claws in the future? Why does Xavier claim to have known Mystique since she was a child, when there was no indication of that in the original films? Why does Wolverine claim that in the future he and Hank McCoy (Beast) are friends when there was no previous indication of that? In the climax of the film, the sentinels have already been built. Even though they succeed in their mission, what's there to stop someone else from using them? How does Wolverine survive for so long underwater? Did Mystique perform the adamantium experiments on Wolverine? Why and how are Cyclops and Jean Grey alive again at the end? This movie doesn't even so much as attempt to answer any of the questions that it leaves the viewer with! Frankly, it would be easier to solve a Rubik's cube on LSD than it would be be to figure this movie out! So far, I've never been impressed with ANY of the X-men films. 1 and 2 were lame, 3 was garbage, and this one was even worse! I'm done with this franchise! I don't care what they do with the next film, I've put up with all the incompetence I can take! From now on, it's just the x-men comics and cartoons for me. Sorry 20th century fox, but you guys blew it!"

","Ordinary people do not matter. In many ways this film apes the way that people who belong to minorities have more rights than everyone else and think they can do whatever the hell they like.<br/><br/>In this film the mutants have nearly been wiped out by robot Sentinels built by humans and programmed only to kill people with the mutant X gene. Yet is makes it clear in the dystopian future the movie starts in that these Sentinels also kill ordinary people, which makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>Like a lot a time-travel movies, it has daft plot holes and doesn't care about consistency. Towards the film's climax, serial murderer Magneto manages to get the anti-mutant robots to obey him by using his powers to put steel inside them. Okay, that would allow his powers to work on these things, but he wouldn't be able to give them orders, that's just dumb, but he does when it suits the meandering plot.<br/><br/>Over long, overly serious and ultimately disappointing. The effects are good, but they're the usual high end computer Paint Box fare that are blatantly not actually there.<br/><br/>If you're easily impressed and don't care about logic or any characterization or depth, you may still enjoy this."
"sparksnkent","3","31","57","30 May 2014"," Very disappointed
","Let me first say I'm not a comic book fan, so I can't approach my review from that direction. But I did like the X Men movies (except for First Class), mostly because I loved the Wolverine. My favorite was The Wolverine, which I considered to be an excellent character study that made mutants feel believable in the real world- something which the X Men films lacked with their funny suits and spaceships. This movie, however, disappointed me greatly. I left the theater in a state of uncertainty and confusion, and with time to think about it, I realized why I didn't like it.<br/><br/>First, Wolverine was a plot device and as a result seemed very out of character here. He barely did anything Wolvy would really do in most situations. There was no fight scene, no memorable lines- and assaulting men with a cast iron skillet? Really? His emotions were short changed at the end upon seeing Jean gray alive- but then all the characters emotional reactions seemed to resolve themselves at a rapid rate, so much so that their internal struggles felt unreal and unsympathetic.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was a traditional X Men opening, which excited me at first. But I couldn't feel anything for some of the mutants fighting for their lives like Blink and Sunspot and Bishop, when I didn't even know who they were personally- character development is not simply a display of power. The movie went south once Trask was introduced as experimenting on mutants. Wasn't that done before? And Stryker's reasons for experimentation were much more compelling. There was material reused from previous X Men films. I couldn't believe the scene with Mystique in Trask's office looking through files with a secretary coming up the stairs. This was along the same lines as the scene in X2 when she finds the files on cerebro- then quickly shape shifts before being discovered. However, the scene in X2 was much more suspenseful. And Magneto lifts a sports stadium and drops in around the White House. Not sure what that was for but a big CGI display. And folks railed against the Golden Gate Bridge destruction in the Last Stand, but at least that was to get to the island on the other side. And the sentinels- they looked liked big Iron Men...<br/><br/>There is so much more I could address- like the use of Mystique's blood- that did not make sense. The acting was terrible among the younger cast, but J Lawrence took the cake. Every time she said a line it was painful- I thought the original Mystique was so much better. James McAvoy was OK, but every time Xavier had a conflict, he just as quickly recovered so the story could continue on. The drama oftentimes felt rushed.<br/><br/>The director couldn't seem to settle on where to put the camera on the action scenes, which made the stories execution and terrible script seem worse. The best part of the movie was Wolvy,s fight with Beast, and a couple of ideas that could have been so awesome- like the older Magneto reaching out to Charles in the future setting near the end. Once again, the emotions were rushed and improperly shot. It felt as if the entire film was over shot and then sloppily edited. The script was awful and there were no memorable lines.<br/><br/>The screenwriter did say the script was intended as a goodbye to the original cast. But what an awful way to say goodbye to all of them- especially Wolvy, who looked like a sissy in this film. <br/><br/>The teen film seems to reign in theaters today. The younger you are, the better. It used to be that middle aged stars could carry films for years- think Harrison Ford and Clint Eastwood. But now being in one's forties is just to old, so you have to be recast and written out. The only reason I went to see this movie was Wolvy and the original cast. It's sad to see X Men so mistreated and wiped aside for a younger cast that just can't deliver the emotions or the setting half as good."

","I want to start off by saying that my brother, Nick predicted this movie after the 2nd X-Men film. He is a true comic book geek and saw this coming. I am sure that he is not the only one. I was more of a bi-polar comic geek. I read Archie and Richie Rich on good days and Tales from the Crypt and Tales from the Darkside on bad days. I read super hero comics sporadically. My brother informed me that Quicksilver (Evan Peter) is Magneto's son. I had no clue. Speaking of Quicksilver, he was my favorite character in this film. When assigned a task, I never had a concern that he would not complete it. Apparently he will make another appearance in the next film. Once again I neglected to stay through the credits and missed some important information. Nick informs me that it has something to do with the apocalypse. I really need to start staying through the credits of not only Marvel films, but also DC Comic films. Anyway, I was really glad to see the original X-men join forces with their younger selves. They even found a way to include Major Bill Stryker (Josh Helman). I was glad to see Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) as the person with the power to make going back to the past possible, but for some reason I was getting flashbacks to the film Inception. Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) has his mind set on creating Cyborgs that would identify mutants and destroy them and it is the X-Men's goal to travel to the past and to keep the present future from happening. I would be remised if I did not mention Mark Camacho (President Nixon). Not only did he do a great interpretation of the president, but the whole recreation of the 70s was done extremely well. There were glimpses of every X-Men film to date incorporated in this film and the writers did an excellent job tying them all together. This is one of those films that you really do not have to advertise. Most people are so engaged with the X-Men, that it would be almost criminal not to see the franchise through. I thoroughly enjoyed the film because (1) it was not too long and (2) there weren't any dull spots. This is definitely a film worth seeing, especially if you want to be ready for the next one."
"hypestyle","10","13","21","31 May 2014"," Two Generations of X-Men Anchor their Latest Adventure
","""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is the latest film in 20th Century Fox's enduring franchise based on the Marvel Comics team of superheroes. The plot hinges on the team's main tough guy Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, fresh off last year's solo outing as the character) being sent back in time to stop robots from taking over the world. An assortment of X-Men movie alumni make calculated appearances throughout the era-spanning film.<br/><br/>The film begins in a dystopian future, where security robots called Sentinels have gone rogue and laid waste to much of human society and the mutant population alike. As a voice-over from the film's trailer proclaims, ""They started out targeting mutants then they started targeting everybody."" The status of most world governments is unclear but apparently the Sentinels have a global mandate, as what remains of the X-Men have become nomadic renegades. Even longtime mutant-rights rival Magneto (Ian McKellen) is now a de facto member. The ragtag outfit (including Halle Berry as weather-mistress Storm) travels the world, searching for a way to stop the Sentinels while trying to avoid capture or execution. The latest incarnation of the killing machines have the ability to create perfect counter-measures for most attacks, so even the mutants' considerable powers are frequently stymied in combat. Article Photo Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, center) must bridge the chasm between Xavier (James McAvoy, left) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender, right) in order to save the future in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" A strangely resurrected Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart, whose character was killed in X-Men: The Last Stand) returns as the moral leader of the team. He's strategized a Hail-Mary stunt to hopefully end the genocide and stop the Sentinels once and for all. His idea? Just have Wolverine time-travel 40 years into the past and stop the assassination of a key political figure. The powers of Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) help send Wolverine's mind back into his 1973 body. (Wolverine looks the same as before, thanks to his longevity powers—but his claws aren't yet fused with a steel alloy, so he's only slightly less dangerous to tick off.) But even when abetted by mutant powers, things are never as easy as planned. In the past, younger Xavier (James McAvoy) has abandoned running his boarding school for mutant children. Having retreated into alcohol, he spends most days un-sober and embittered about the creeping social animosity toward mutants. Meanwhile, the younger Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is imprisoned hundreds of feet beneath the Pentagon.<br/><br/>The would-be assassin that Wolverine is tasked to stop is Raven, a.k.a. Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), whose shape-shifting allows her to imitate anyone. She's gradually working her way to getting rid of scientist Bolivar Trask (Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage). Convinced that mutants are an invasive species, Trask's military-hardware company builds the Sentinels as the answer to containing ""the mutant problem."" The grand unveiling of the Sentinels is planned to take place in the midst of Vietnam War peace talks. As such, even President Richard Nixon (Mark Camacho) is brought into the plot.<br/><br/>Only Nixon could go to China, and thus only the brawler Wolverine could be sent to play peacemaker between the estranged Xavier and Magneto as the dawn of the Sentinels nears. The plot is punctuated by yet another threat in Major William Stryker (Josh Helman), an army scientist using mutants as guinea pigs.<br/><br/>Taking into account the vast ensemble cast, Jackman, McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence get the most screen time and director Bryan Singer manages to get substantive mileage out of their respective performances. Audiences will believe in the alternating mutual bitterness and empathy between Charles, Magneto and Raven's highly dysfunctional— and volatile — surrogate family, with Jackman's Logan and Nicholas Hoult's Hank as harried (and hairy) caretakers. The future X-Men have a smaller role to play here compared to their 70s counterparts, but the fight sequences with the Sentinels are top notch. New characters Quicksilver (Evan Peters in a very memorable turn) and Blink (Bingbing Fan), in particular, have some nifty visual tricks.<br/><br/>Perhaps inadvertently, the filmmakers (including director Singer and co-writer Simon Kinberg) manage to tap into contemporary concerns about drone-driven surveillance and warfare. Also of note is that the future X-Men team essentially takes on the role of terrorists—from the robots' point of view, anyway. The comics' pop-allegory about social tolerance (or the lack thereof) is somewhat obscured by dizzying fight scenes and laser bursts, but Days of Future Past is still a highly competent action fantasy."
"comsatteur","10","13","21","24 May 2014"," Who needs Avengers when you got X-Men?
","Putting aside my being a die-hard Marvel fan and summoning my critical perception to the film, I say this with most sincerity, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the best film of X-Men franchise yet, and for that matter one of cinematic history's best of the superhero genre, easily lining itself to other superhero films' gems like The Dark Knight and the Avengers. I would like to begin by saying that Bryan Singer is a miracle worker (making the ""impossible"" filmable), making X-Men DOFP one of his finest. Singer carefully crafted every single scene with such awe and sincerity that the word perfection isn't enough to describe it. May it be a series of CGI effects, unique action extravaganzas, and powerful, moving emotional scenes, Singer never failed to blend the elements of a superhero film with human drama. His powerful direction certainly brought the best in each of the cast and unlocked their hidden potentials. For the storyline, I would like to commend the writers for their excellent writing that never failed to amuse and captivate the audience with powerful storytelling while maintaining logic and perceiving bigger messages to society and human faults. (BTW I'm not a huge comic book reader so I don't have any idea what X-Men DOFP would be about) Anyways, the writers did an excellent job in connecting the dots from the past X- Men films (though it's not necessary to watch them all to fully understand the film). Now for the stellar cast: I think the whole cast (both new and recurring) did their best to fully portray the characters they're embodying. First, kudos both to Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, who both are the embodiment of X-Men themselves; even though their pretty much in the same place the whole film, their performance proved to be timeless without severing emotional vulnerability and the bond of a strong true friendship. Hugh Jackman's performance in the film could be argued as his best portrayal of Wolverine yet. What can we say? He's Hugh Jackman. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's characters have evolved so much from the first film, and the two of them displayed performance that made X-Men DOFP superior to other X-Men films. Their portrayals held such pain and confusion from their damaged relationship that made them human despite their superhuman distinctions. Of course there's the ever-astonishing Jennifer Lawrence whose acting prowess is unmatched. Lawrence's Mystique is one of the best portrayal of a troubled character in a superhero film, exploiting mixed feelings with pure acting that made Mystique and Jennifer Lawrence a very crucial piece to the film's success. And for the newcomer Peter Dinklage of Game of Thrones, portrayed a villain with no actual superpowers but made the future as it was in the beginning of the film. His role as Bolivar Trask is an interesting character fighting for survival with judgment clouded by society's erroneous perception. The actors in the supporting roles also did very well. Ellen Page got the spotlight she deserved with her vulnerable yet enduring portrayal of Kitty Pride, who's the bread-and-butter character of the film. Shawn Ashmore has grown so much since his first X-Men film, and that maturity is very much shown in his strong portrayal of Iceman. Halle Berry, while she has a much smaller role in the film, steals the spotlight every second she appeared on screen. The appearance of Bill Stryker (Josh Helman) is of course appreciated as it gives us a brief window to Wolverine's character and proves the quantum theory about time which is an important aspect to the storyline. Smaller roles which are included for filling the shoes of other characters showed so much potential that it's too disappointing they didn't got a chance to develop throughout the film: Colossus (who's supposed to be Kitty Pride's couple, though I don't think that's necessary for now), Sunspot, Bishop, Warpath, Blink (instantly my new favorite character) and Havok from the past. By the way, special mention to Evan Peters and his portrayal of Quicksilver for being too awesome. I think it's very obvious that he would appear not only in future X-Men films but also in other Marvel films (such as Avengers 2) because he's such an iconic character. As expected, the cameo appearances by James Marsden and Famke Janssen as Cyclops and Phoenix set us for the next X-Men film, which I think is great. So that's pretty much my though for X-Men: Days of Future Past (not including the visual effects, sound, costume design etc.). This is a must-see film and it is sure to entrance die-hard Marvel fans and non-fan viewers alike."

","In the future Sentinels are hunting and killing mutants, in an attempt to save mutantkind Wolverine is sent back to the past to change the future.<br/><br/>Movies that take on time travel take a huge risk, it generally makes for a flawed film. After seeing several good reviews about X-men: Days of Future Past I hoped it would be good. Nope.<br/><br/>First off the explanation for time traveling is just a cheap mutant ability to keep fans from questioning it. They also use the same excuse to exclude the butterfly effect from occurring.<br/><br/>Secondly the current timeline that is supposed fix all connection problems from the original trilogy to X-men: First Class is so horribly flawed I truly don't understand how fans can stick up for this nonsense.<br/><br/>The action scenes were mediocre, nothing amazing. The acting, uninteresting. They have great talent like Peter Dinklage and Evan Peters and make them look like they're B-list forgettable actors. Its really sad.<br/><br/>This movie is so horribly overrated by fanboys that it currently resides on the IMDb's top 250 list. Its rated higher then classic films like the original Planet of the Apes and Arsenic and Old Lace.<br/><br/>This is dumb filmmaking for audiences who want to watch loads of special effects and lame but good looking actors. Wanna watch a new action film with good characters and emotions? Try Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. A film with logic."

","X-Men: Days Of Future Past<br/><br/>Just got home from watching the most awaited X- Men movie this year, Days of Future Past. And my reaction? Meh, are you kidding me...It's like the best X-Men movie after X2.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer really did well on directing this movie. He is really an X-Men geek! He always know what to give to these starving X-Men fans.<br/><br/>The movie is so intense, very emotional, and really puts you to the edge of your seat. Some fans might not like it, cause there's not much of 'explosions' or 'jump-packed-actionsm-scenes', this movie shows more of what these mutant can do with their powers. And don't get me wrong, I actually like how Singer did to this movie. Perhaps he was just avoiding the audience to get confused of the scenes from 'Past', then 'Future' then some 'Flashbacks'.<br/><br/>I also liked how they highlighted the abilities of #Quicksilver and #Blink. I am actually looking forward more on Quicksilver's performance on the upcoming ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" since he really did good during this movie.<br/><br/>And man, #JamesMcAvoy, the young Charles, stole the movie in terms of acting and drama. His emotions shown in this movie were so intense. #Mystique you are love as ever, Mutant and Proud!!! #Wolverine is still him here, not much for a change (though he has seen the young Stryker) but I wonder what will happen now since #JeanGrey and #Cyclops are back? And may I ask why #AnnaPaquin's #Rogue was so little? And please give more action+screen time to a classic X-Man - Storm next time. #Storm is really an underrated X- Men character.<br/><br/>I can't detail all of what had happened in the movie, but yes, obviously, I like the movie a lot! And that's just me, others might hate it. But I am one of those people who actually liked the movie so much. <br/><br/>And by the way, if your watching the movie STAY UNTIL THE VERY END. This is a Marvel movie, so expect a post-credit scene or should I call it a stinger. You will see, if I am right the horsemen & perhaps some hints of ""Apocalypse"". <br/><br/>Oh well, you should totally watch it. 9/10.<br/><br/>#XMenDoFP #XMenApocalypseSooooon #XMenSpoilers"

","Being a X-Men comic fan, I could not wait for this movie to come out. Days of future past is one of the story arcs which define the X-Men comics and seeing that Bryan Singer came back to direct, I thought that this effort would surely bring back the X-Men franchise in the eyes of the fans....or does it. Seeing that Rogue was cut out of the theatrical release was not a good start. But when I saw that there were plenty of other mutant characters I kept my hopes up for a classic offering.<br/><br/>As there was not a single cinema in town that offered the film in 2D in original language, I was forced watched the 3D version. Totally unnecessary and the viewing experience is made worse because the polarised glasses make the ""future"" scenes even harder to see since they are mostly filmed in darkness.<br/><br/>My first complaint is that the movie dives straight into action. A fight between the last of the mutants and the sentinels. There is no explanation on why these were the last mutants standing, and who they were. The movie also ignores the otherworldly Marvel characters who would be more than a match for the sentinels. The sentinel powers are also given a twist, plus their design differs from what we know from the comics. Now a great start for me.<br/><br/>Most of the film is based in 1973 and, during these parts, we see a total of 6 mutants with 4 or 5 other cameo appearances. There was no logical reason for why Wolverine chose Quicksilver for breaking into the Pentagon. Whereas the first Bryan Singer X-Men movie gave us 4 mutant villains, this movie only contained misguided characters. When compared to the other X-Men movies there are relatively fewer action scenes which really show off the mutant powers. It just felt cheap to me and to be brutally honest I was more impressed by the trailers than the film itself. I genuinely felt conned by Days of future past.<br/><br/>The mid-credits scene was also placed after ALL the credits have rolled. That means you have to sit through 5-10 minutes of uninteresting info. I won't give away what it entails (although you can easily do a google) but I would say that it brought me very little excitement as it does not tie in with any of the other Marvel movies.<br/><br/>The first X-Men movie in 2000 was a no-nonsense classic. The Wolverine showed promise in bringing back the same gritty action. Unfortunately, Days of future past was a disappointment for me."
"ironhorse_iv","8","7","10","24 May 2014"," X-marks the spot again! X-Men: Days of Future Past was an xtremely good movie!
","From all the X-Men story lines that comic fans could see; they finally pick the one that most fans wanted to see. Directed by X-Men movie founder, Bryan Singer; the movie is based on the 1981 Uncanny X-Men storyline ""Days of Future Past"" by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Most fans might remember the 1990's animated cartoon series, that feature this Sentinels storyline, but the movie really did improve of the concept. The only problem is that the movie is trying so hard to tie in all the X-Men film series with this storyline idea that left a lot of plot-holes, missing exposition, and huge changes to certain character's look and history. A lot of hardcore fans will probably rant about that from the unexplained Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) coming back from the death from the events of 2006's X-Men: Last Stand or how the Days of Future Past's 1973's doesn't match up with the 1973's settling of 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I like to think that movie is trying to erase both the badly made movies events from history. With any time travel movie, there will be a lot of complex paradoxes. So let's just say this film is one of the many multiverse to save time. Since, it's also a comic book movie, you have to suspense your disbelief really hard to enjoy this movie. So, I wouldn't nitpick the movie so much, but I do have to say, the minor differs between the comic version and the movie version are not that big of a deal. I don't mind the artist license, they took, as much as some die-hard fan of the comics, because I really did find it, entertaining. As the film serve as sequel to both 2006's X-Men: The Last Stand and 2011's X-Men: First Class. Much of the continuous story comes from those two movies, but you can see hints of all seven movies in this. This movie marks Hugh Jackman's seventh portrayal of Logan/Wolverine. He will be the only actor to appear in the entire X-Men film series. That's insane, how big Wolverine has become. That's what the fans wanted. No wonder, why he took over Kitty Pryce (Ellen Page) place in the story. Without spoiling too much of it, if you haven't readt the comic. In the dystopian future of 2023, sentient robots known as Sentinels are exterminating both mutants and humans. The only way to stop them is for Kitty Pryce to send Wolverine back into time to 1973 to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing their founder, Bolivar Trask, (Peter Dinklage) that lead to the upgrade the Sentinels needed to take down, the mutants. While, the movie makes Wolverine, the all-time hero, the movie gives as least, some more character arch to others such as young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and Mystique, giving them the room to grow. Great acting from all three. The cast for this film is really large, and I think for the most part, they gave enough screen-time for most of the minor characters. Still, I would had love to see Rogue (Anna Paquin) in a bigger role. Also, don't be surprise to find out, that some of the 2011's First Class characters introduce in that film, are now dead and few dead characters from the other movies returns. I think the addition of Evan Peters as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver was fun to watch. I really love his scenes. It's weird that he slated to appear in Disney's 2015: Avengers: Age of Ultron. The legal complexities over the license of the character just odd. Disney Marvel and Fox Studios had resolution to the previous legal issues, which had Quicksilver appear in this film as well as an Avengers sequel, though under certain parameters: no reference to Quicksilver's membership in the Avengers or X-Men can be mention in both films. It gets weirder when the theatrical release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 in April 2014 had a scene from this movie, making it look like Sony and Fox would team up, do a Spider-Man/ X-Men crossover. Once again, legal issues prevent that of ever happening. Peter Dinklage seem odd choice for Boliver Trask, due to his dwarfism, but I think its gives a way more self-loathing characteristic to Trask that wasn't there, before. Still, a lot of his scenes do feel weird. At less, pulling him in the film the assassination plot, makes more sense than Senator Kelly. Also makes sure, to check out after the credits for a certain cameo from another X-Men villain. I found the movie makes new Deus ex machine as it goes kinda annoying. One thing, I really did find offending is the outrageous story of the JFK assassination controversy. Not only, wasn't it explore in great detail, it felt like a throw away plot, just to have more action scenes of Magneto escaping the jail cell. Don't get me wrong, I love all the action scenes and found the Sentinels to be a great threat. I just wish the Sentinels were little bigger. I do have to say, the CGI for the most part was great, but the CGI for the 1973's Sentinels were pretty bad. Watch the train scene to understand, what I'm talking about. The soundtrack was epic. The movie was pretty dark for a PG-13 film. It was pretty gruesome at times. Lots of dead bodies, and limps being rip apart. This movie might not be for all children. There is a few surprising nude scenes that the ladies would like. Don't worry, men. Mystique is still look pretty naked in this film. Better than her look in First Class. The language is bit harsh. The humor was funny as hell. Lots of inside jokes, and winks to the comic book fans. Lots of symbolism metaphor messages ranging from civil rights to gay rights that people can debate on. Overall: In my opinion, the best X-Men in the film series so far."

","X-Men: Days Of Future Past is a movie about the slippery paradoxes and mutable mechanics of time travel. Although the storyline was conceived back in the early '80s for a two-issue run of the Uncanny X-Men comic book, it feels like it was dreamed up especially to solve the problem Fox faced after 2011's X-Men: First Class: what to do with a franchise that's been split into two time-lines, with two sprawling casts? The answer, clearly, is to put all of it in a big pot and stir. <br/><br/>Coming back to direct is Bryan Singer, who seems to have himself jumped back in time. Whether he's been recharged by his decade away from the series, or by the prospect of eradicating some of the dodgier plot-turns made by Brett Ratner's The Last Stand, this is easily the most on-form and playful he's been since X2.<br/><br/>The action scenes in this movie are fantastic. The opening scene alone made me feel like a kid again: pitting young mutants against a teeming mass of unstoppable Sentinel robots. And that's just the beginning. Magneto's prison escape from the Pentagon is well executed and Mystique has some great scenes just on her own.<br/><br/>Jumping between the future and the past, the plot teeters on the edge of becoming exhaustingly knotty. Fortunately, the story distracts from any temporal muddles by zeroing in on three of the most charismatic characters in the X-universe: Wolverine, plus the younger iterations of Xavier and Magneto. <br/><br/>My issues with the movie are minuscule, at least for me; however, they are obvious. First off, Wolverine doesn't have his metal claws. I don't like his bone claws. And even though I do like the ending a lot (it's one of the best endings ever in comic book movie history), it means they have erased EVERYTHING about the X-Men franchise even the good things. So that means the first two X-Men movies didn't happen, as well as the bad ones. It's now just X-Men First Class and this movie. <br/><br/>The best X-Men EVER, this sequel/prequel/reboot trashes the '70s with élan.), What's here is all good (with some minor exceptions). The characters are all good, and the stakes are really high, and the execution is well done. This is the X-Men movie I wanted, and now, I hope that they will make more X-Men movies like this one: strong emphasis on characters, action, stakes, and a good solid story."
"prospectus_capricornium","9","11","18","22 May 2014"," Gripping Time-Travel Tale and A Surging Epic
","Showcasing the biggest assembly of Marvel's mutants ever, 'Days of Future Past' claws its way on top of the X-Men franchise.<br/><br/>Sensing the brink of extinction, Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor X (Patrick Stewart) unite together in an attempt to save their species from the Sentinels. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) travels back in time to stop Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), now called Mystique, from killing anti-mutant scientist Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage). Logan has to convince both the younger Magneto and Charles to stop Mystique before she gets captured and studied, which in turn would give way to the creation of Sentinels.<br/><br/>While, there is so much incoherence in how the time travel aspect of the plot is presented, this must still be Bryan Singer's best X-Men film. The greatest strength of this movie lays on how it pays so much more attention to its story and script than the visual spectacle it can surely serve. Surprisingly, the movie vaunts some funny and light moments particularly those with Quicksilver (Evan Peter). Quicksilver has enjoyed highlight in this film as his section is streaked with laugh-rendering wit and humor. Jennifer's role is arguably one of the central if not the most vital in the movie. Hugh Jackman's take remains the same, but somehow feels fresh. Michael Fassbender's Magneto and James McAvoy's Professor X are satisfying than their old counterparts, which, by the way, is not surprising, as the rest of the cast are actually just story pawns.<br/><br/>'Days of Future Past' is a bold take to raise the X-Men franchise into another level. It toying with history is ambitious, suspenseful and confusing, but it nonetheless manages to escalate itself to a higher ground. A surging epic and a gripping tale that seems not to loosen its hold on the audiences, 'Days of A Future Past' must be X-Men's biggest installment to date."

","reading a few reviews from newspapers and the internet i never understood how a superhero movie with a time travel theme can be better than fiction movies like 'star trek'(2009) or 'back to the future'(1985). i went in for a 3d movie and was surprised to watch half the movie without the 3d glasses. 3d technology at its worst can be witnessed in this movie(but the specs say this movie was shot on real 3d cameras (highly debatable). SPOILERS AHEAD: 1. the future is dark (meaning there is no sunlight in the future... that is dumb by all standards) 2. wolverine has gray hair though others tell him he does not age at all. 3. freezing superheated metal makes the metal shatter (dumb iceman) 4. sentinels are the biggest joke I've seen in superhero movie since superman lifting kryptonite island in superman returns. 5. Hugh Jackman starred in the movie to portray a shirtless man who tells Charles to use his mind to speak to future Charles(doesn't do a thing in the whole movie). 6. blink dies the same way twice... as if she matters. 7. magneto was broken from prison to be sent back to prison. 8. Jennifer Lawrence was CGIfied for every scene except the talking ones(completely unnecessary) 9. kitty pryde bled for two days in the future and didn't die (why does Bryan singer make movies any more) 10. old sentinels were hacked by metal bars and obey magneto (again. why does Bryan singer make movies anymore) 11. hank's mutation suppression serum could have been mass produced in the dark times to avoid sentinel attacks.<br/><br/>MATHEW VAUGHN needs great respect to have revived the xmen franchise but days of future past was a publicity stunt to just breach the box office barriers garnering all fans of Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, Patrick Stewart, Ian mckellen, Michael fassbender, Ellen page, James mcavoy and halle berry.<br/><br/>the one star in this review is given to the only star in this movie who matters (EVAN PETERS).... his engaging 7 minute screen time is the only thing that matters in the movie."
"C22Man","7","4","5","5 June 2016"," A Solid Entry
","X-Men: Days of Future Past saw Bryan Singer return to the director's chair for the film series that he helped spark, having something of a mixed legacy since he chose not to direct The Last Stand. Following on from the effortlessly entertaining and swaggering First Class was never going to be an easy feat, especially with director Matthew Vaughn deciding not to return. However, a smart decision was made with Days of Future Past to craft a time-leaping plot with the political and social uncertainty of 1970's United States. Singer's familiarity with the character shines through which leads to an inventive and exciting entry to the series.<br/><br/>Story: In an apocalyptic future both humans and mutants are hunted by Sentinels, originally created in the 1970's to hunt mutants. Wolverine is forced to go back in time and prevent the assassination of the creator of the Sentinels, Bolivar Trask, in order to stop this future from happening. This story works perfectly in both creating a thrilling journey and in merging the old cast with the new. Sending Wolverine into the past to meet the younger Xavier and Magneto creates its own amusing outcomes, but it also allows for loose ends to be tied up. We find out how many of these characters came to be and how they're links to the X-Men were formed. The film also manages to expertly capture the feeling of unrest after the end of the Vietnam War and of the political paranoia found in many 70's thrillers.<br/><br/>Heroes: Hugh Jackman is a great lead once again as Wolverine takes centre stage. By this point he has all of the characters intricacies down perfectly and provides plenty of energy as well as humour. James McAvoy is excellent as a much more vulnerable Xavier who struggles to embrace his power and his arc throughout the film is carried off well, while Patrick Stewart makes a welcomed return as the older Xavier.<br/><br/>Villains: Michael Fassbender impresses again as Magneto. Showing that the characters conflict began early is a clever move and Fassbender makes his struggle feel so believable. Ian McKellen is also good fun in his return to the role. Peter Dinklage is superb in an understated performance as Trask. Making the character a dwarf is a nice subtle contrast to the mutants, but outside of that Dinklage gives the dialogue weight and provides a reserved intensity that works fantastically.<br/><br/>Support: Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique plays a much larger role in the plot here. She being the one who attempts the assassination and the character's DNA being used to craft the Sentinels. Lawrence is simply okay in the role. Nicholas Hoult does standout as Beast, giving the role are geekiness without overdoing it.<br/><br/>Action: The action scenes are as slick and stylish as ever before, with the emphasis on the scope of the sequences rather than the physicality. Arguably the highlight scene is breaking Magneto out of the Pentagon. Featuring super speedster Quicksilver, the editing is fantastic and the sheer inventiveness of the scene is a joy to behold. The climax involving the White House is also very creative.<br/><br/>Music: John Ottman's score is very Hans Zimmer like. There's a lot of throbbing synths and bombastic brass that can get distracting. That said, his more restrained pieces are very effective and work well as a backdrop to the drama.<br/><br/>Production: The visuals in the film are great and Singer shows that he can still make things look classy. As stated, what impressed me the most was that ability to capture the 1970's so effectively, with the film strongly invoking thrillers such as 'Marathon Man' and 'All the President's Men' for its era of paranoia. Switching these social and political issues over to the mutants was handled with grace. The effects were flawless for the most part, with the Sentinels looking unique as well as intimidating and images like Magneto lifting a football stadium looking spectacular. The story and character writings are a strength, with the film doing a really impressive job in explaining all of the motivations behind the characters decisions. I think Mystique lacks mystery, but her struggle between good and evil is played out well. I think the films main flaws lie in comparison to the earlier films in that I think at times it lacks the fluidity of X2 and the enthusiasm of First Class despite its intelligent story-telling.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Days of Future Past is another strong entry in the X-Men series, simultaneously developing its universes past whilst building onto its characters futures. There's a great deal fleshed out here and the story never loses focus, which is all the more impressive when you realise just how much is going on. We're at a point now where we really understand these characters and their personalities, so going into the past is actual a good logical choice. There is almost nothing to fault from a technical, action and acting standpoint, while Singer directs as if he's never been away. The film works on both levels, providing an entertaining action trip and for offering some interesting social commentary from that period."

Time fly's by as the action takes place in the 70's, full of camcorder action, 70's ditties and enough old school fashion to outrival American Hustle, the jaunt back in time really takes X-Men to places we have not yet been and with a fantastic cast, all feels steadily on song to become the quintessential adventure in the series so far but then low and behold like so many before it, this superhero adventure gets lost in its third act.<br/><br/>Days of Future Past seemingly went all out to create a 3rd act not content with one time frame but multiple ones, and it becomes a mess of a million different ideas flying about the screen all at once. There's mutants v humans, sentinels vs mutants (in the future!), President Nixon and Tyrion Lannister verse our hero's and a raft of other subplots and ideas to boot. It's a real shame, but the finale to the film feels like a major step down from what had been building before it and it feels less spectacle and more preaching, which in this genre never seems to completely work. While the ending is a huge anticlimax the acting by the large is fantastic with Fassbender and McAvoy in particular continuing on their fine turns and the direction of Singer is often highly inventive, therefore the film feels frequently fresh.<br/><br/>This newest entry into the X-Men cannon has been highly regarded by critics and audiences alike and with a large haul at the Box Office the world over it looks likely that many will be waiting Apocalypse's arrival with baited breathe. There is a lot to like in this journey and there are some inspired ideas that sadly culminate in an unsatisfactory and overblown finale. It's hard to agree with all the praise and love given to this film that in the end is nothing more than an enjoyable romp in the universe that is Marvel, but I guess we should all be thankful, it's like those horrible Wolverine movies never happened.<br/><br/>3 and a half floating stadiums out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check into - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
"MovieSonic","7","4","5","25 September 2014"," Good but the inconsistencies are too distracting
","My general summary is that this is a 'good' film with lots of action, 'some' great acting and is overall well worth watching.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can't give this more than a 7 (much as I would like to as I love X-Men) because for me, this was as good/disappointing as the Breaking Bad finale.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>Obviously the 'real' leads: James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Gripping acting from them as per usual. I liked the Sentinels. And Peter Dinklage.<br/><br/>That's about it.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>I'm not sure there's any point in listing the plot holes and inconsistencies because I'm not very observant so I'm sure people will spot way more than I did and the internet has lots of hilarious pages dedicated to finding the faults. Also, I don't usually care about plot holes but inconsistencies really wind me up because it's so lazy. Decide if you're following the comics or not. If not, make damn sure you follow the events of the previous films. You have to reckon that even if the writers had never heard of X-Men before, 'someone' at some point would have seen the script and gone ""noooo, that can't happen because..."" but no. All the way through this film I was rolling my eyes and groaning and shouting and asking ""HOW??"", ""WHY??"" and the millions of inconsistencies kept taking me out of the film and ruined the experience for me (hence the 7).<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence. I was never on the bandwagon and I don't hate her either so (that proves?!) this criticism is genuinely an honest opinion: really bad casting. The original Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) moved like a serpent (I mean that in a good way) and had a low sultry voice but Jennifer just looks and sounds like a sulky teenager in most of her scenes. James and Michael are so convincing in part because they nail the accents. Jennifer doesn't even attempt to change her accent or voice. The first time she played Mystique I could overlook it because she was just playing 'the kid version' and wasn't the real Mystique in my eyes but now that she's played her twice, I feel like they want us to think of her as much as being the real Mystique as we do of James and Michael being the real Professor and Eric...but that won't happen until Jennifer drastically improves her acting. She needs to work on her voice and body language.<br/><br/>The choreography and costumes: sorry to pick on Jennifer, this is probably wardrobe's fault but maybe the actress requested it? She is blatantly wearing a leotard! Like, 'blatantly'!!! If you're going to play such a proud and distinguished character, you should do it properly and just have the body paint. Isn't she supposed to be naked? i.e. refusing to disguise herself in any way? I've never read the comics but Jennifer's Mystique looks so fake and again, it's distracting. Instead of going for a big name, why not go for an actress who's willing to play the part right?<br/><br/>Regarding the choreography throughout the film: There were loads of fight scenes that felt rushed or unfinished or poorly edited...not sure which. Like the sound effects weren't properly added. They weren't always convincing.<br/><br/>Why can Kitty Pryde (ridiculous name) send people back in time?? How did the Professor get his body back?? Why is it suddenly acceptable to provide important plot points in DVD commentary? NO, NO, NO! Plot points essential to the development of a story MUST be provided in the film otherwise your film is SH*T!!<br/><br/>Tangent: Someone online explained the theory i.e. 'not spoiler' that the Professor got his body back by using the paraplegic's who happened to be his identical twin brother (I don't remember them being identical from the news story in the other film but whatever) and that his twin was in a coma because the Professor's psychic abilities overwhelmed his brother's mind in the womb. Two things wrong with that explanation: 1- The Professor states in this film that he only developed his powers at around 9(ish). A foetus would almost certainly not have reached puberty and would therefore not have been exhibiting any mutant abilities. 2- Even if there was some weird 'developing-foetus glitch' and the Professor did in fact manage to exhibit mutant abilities so powerful it knocked his twin into a coma: 2b- Why has his twin been kept on life support for the last 60 years or so since birth?? 2c- Would that even happen in real life?? 2d- Given that his twin also has to have the exact same abilities otherwise the Professor would now be in a non-mutant body without powers, why would his twin be affected if he has the same genetics and same psychic abilities? I suppose it's possible he just wasn't having a developing-foetus glitch that day like his brother. Unfortunate for him.<br/><br/>The point is that if you take over a project and disagree with the death of someone, bring them back in a way that makes sense and also: ACTUALLY EXPLAIN IT !!<br/><br/>The ending was great on the one hand because of a reason I can't say but disappointing because it reminded me of the happily ever after of Breaking Bad. Also: that's how you could have brought the Professor back. But whatever.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, I would have given this a 6. Just FYI.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>(I have to ask: why couldn't Bobby/Iceman fly them all away on his ice skateboard whilst Logan was off fixing the past? Or at least just Kitty and Logan?)"

Bryan Singer's return to the series results in his best film since The Usual Suspects and one of the best comic book-inspired films this side of The Dark Knight. Using intricate CGI and arresting visuals, time-honored sci-fi plot twists swirling around time travel, and a sense of humor, Singer has crafted a perfect cinematic treat.

"hopsinglinglao","1","38","80","23 May 2014"," Heroin Addict Super Heroes, Just What Our Kids Need!
","I give this film one star because the best part was by FAR the quicksilver character and his shining scene(s), which was well worth the ticket price to see. And the acting in this film as well as CGI is great.<br/><br/>But this is an already over-hyped, over ambitious, bunch of nothingness on the screen for 2 hours that is disappointing when you think about it for more than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>What is with the need to have Wolverine's Bare A** in a pg-13 movie basically for kids who like comic books? ? And a funny line from the much better predecessor, First Class, dropped the F-Bomb in a very useful and powerful way, but in this film they use their PG13 F word to reference an already old joke...WE GET IT. It's not funny, if you're going to be edgy, make it an R Rated film. Not sure why in a light-hearted super hero film we need this garbage along with a side plot of our main character basically being hooked to smack and shooting needles into his arm like it's a Pulp Fiction junkie.<br/><br/>And does every super hero movie since Dark Knight have to be full of gloomy whining ironically detached emo hipster super heroes?<br/><br/>And the remainder of this review is all WHYS for Hollywood writers/executives who thought this script made sense:<br/><br/>Why the cliché 70's schtick? Just because the 70's has iconic events and fashion/music, doesn't mean that every waking moment was filled with greatest hits of the 70's references, and not every person was dressed like a bad SNL sketch about the 70's, and not every 70's film has to drive into our heads that JFK, NIXON, and the Vietnman War were all things....and furthermore, the bad technocolor ""70's"" film footage of mutants fighting was laughable and brought NOTHING to the film, and never paid off whatsoever. Not to mention most of the technology made no sense in other spots of the film. <br/><br/>Why try to keep true to real historical characters in our history like Nixon or JFK when in movies like X2 there is just some generic president of the USA??? Just referencing history's greatest hits that mouthbreathers MAY HAVE HEARD OF, does not automatically make your film epic or legit.<br/><br/>Why the rushed distopian future set up and why if the killer terminator robots were made and operational in the 1970's did we not hear anything about them in the previous X Men films? It's as shoehorned as the ""prophecy"" from the Star Wars prequels. The future world did not feel lived in...it was just set piece and set piece and set piece, filled with some characters who seem more interesting than the boring idiots we were following.<br/><br/>Why cram so many characters into the film when you can't fit ALL of them anyways? Cyclops for 2 seconds may as well be no cyclops. Where was Magic Mike as Gambit? May as well.<br/><br/>What is the need to have teen wolf in this movie? I mean, beast. But seriously, the makeup makes him look like Teen Wolf and his powers in this over optimistic scenario did not really stack up well. Should have brought back night crawler or...anyone else.<br/><br/>WHY Stryker AGAIN? Why Magneto AGAIN? Are these the only villains we can get in EVERY F**king X men film from now on? Every X Men movie now has had the same major villain and Wolverine Origins had stupid young Stryker already, it is getting old. And on a side note, Magneto as a character has conflicting personality traits/motivations that make NO sense. The writers need to decide on what type of mind he has, or reveal he has multiple personalities, which he apparently does.<br/><br/>And why does Magneto need an entire baseball stadium to trap a few whitehouse employees? Does he not know that baseball stadiums usually have EXITS? Did he not realize the whitehouse could have had an underground tunnel exit? Did he not realize the president could have been in something NOT made entirely of metal? Did magneto not think the many robots would not suffice? Oh CGI has to look stunning so big set piece shoehorned. And come to think of it, they didn't need magneto at all, they freed this obviously evil idiot just to have him become the villain...AGAIN. <br/><br/>WHY the hell have so few scenes with Quicksilver? He was by far the most charismatic and interesting. Would have paid off if he saved the day instead of Professor King Of Ireland Speech. Which at this point is as surprising as an Optimus Prime pep talk. And seriously so many people in this film had NOTHING to do. <br/><br/>What was the point of making none of the previous films count? Oh NONE OF THAT HAPPENED! Really? Well, if it were X3 or Origins that is good for the studios and our money that is down the toilet.<br/><br/>Time travel is fun but this film's logic is lame.<br/><br/>So sick of getting less for more and being told it is substance, it is the SAME NONSENSE but even more watered down.<br/><br/>I did like those robots too..so hooray for the mutant killers who I wish were the stars of this idiotic mindless film."

","Up front, I should say I'm not a fan of the Marvel (etc.) genre. I wanted to see a movie with my daughter (15) and we both thought we could truck with this, having both enjoyed X-Men: First Class.<br/><br/>An otherwise talented cast ham their way through a wooden script, delivering a few moments of charm but nothing approximating genuine human pathos, and a whole lot of eye-rolling awfulness.<br/><br/>Despite the movie's premise having been lifted from elsewhere, the movie plays out exactly as you would expect. This film treats its audience like children, and could have been written by a committee of younger fans. Perhaps I should have expected that.<br/><br/>For me, special effects are not enough: I've seen those before. They must serve a dramatic purpose, but here, the money shots only served to cheapen my overall experience. Mutants are not enough. I know enough about the characters already. It's like ""okay, I get it - finish the story!"" It lacks anything for grown-ups, having a dramatic arc comparable to Saturday afternoon TV offerings like Dukes of Hazzard or The A Team (showing my age there). Sorry to be blunt, but if this is the best the genre can offer, I will steer clear in future."
"ss_areeb_h","7","5","7","9 September 2014"," Truly Amazing.. But not without flaws
","So far as I have seen this movie has only received positive reviews and it's not without reason. The movie is worth every penny you spend on it and more. However it is not without flaws due to which I cannot name it the best X-men movie. <br/><br/>The plot as you should already know, involves wolverine going into the past to create a better future. The plot is well written and is very entertaining. The transition between past and present is smooth enough and will not in anyway leave you confused. However, there are a few plot holes. DNA sequencing was not discovered until the 80s. Quicksilver's age raises some questions (First Class was only 12 years before so Magneto was probably sleeping around while seeking revenge before the events of First Class).<br/><br/>Next up.. the characters. We get to see several new characters in the future with some amazing powers and abilities. However, they feel quite hollow as you know nothing about them and you don't see much of them except in fight scenes. On the other hand, the past encompasses only 4 characters xavier, magneto, beast and mystique. Quicksilver plays a very small role and I wish I could see more of him as his character is pretty awesome. And since they introduced Quicksilver, they could also have introduced his twin sister the Scarlet Witch (would have been so very awesome). However, you get to see very few characters in the past and that's disappointing because the past is where we are most of the time. <br/><br/>Finally the fight scenes and this is truly where the movie shines. Especially the fights with the sentinels. Each move is so well thought of, you truly feel that the mutants have mastered their powers and use it without having to think. The combination attacks are just perfect and I loved the fight scenes. Though I am gonna state some negatives here too (and you must truly think by now. Gosh will he ever shut up). I was hoping to see wolverine in action (as obviously he's my favorite character) and now that I think about it, he wasn't involved in a single god damn fight. Nothing. At all (unless you consider him beating up hapless goons a fight). I believe the move could have surpassed awesomeness though if it were based on bit more in the future. I mean not the future future the past future.. (am I making sense??) If wolverine had to go back to like 1990 or something. We could see a lot more familiar mutants maybe see a glimpse of their past as well (like storm, jean, scott etc. etc.) And the technology of sentinels would be more believable.<br/><br/>My Final Verdict? Well of course its an X-men movie and there is no reason in hell that you should miss it. Granted its not the best X- men movie but it will definitely keep you rooted to your seat and lets face it... everyone loves watching a super hero movie. (The Fight scenes are truly Brilliant)"
"parmetd","1","25","51","29 May 2014"," One of the worst movies of all time.
","First of all, this movie violates all that makes science fiction great. It seeks to explain every last detail of the science fiction (how sentinels work, how time travel works, why its necessary etc). The beauty in Asimov and the original TV & written versions of this specific story is that the details were not revealed because it was not necessary to do so!<br/><br/>The poorly written and even worse acting of the story aside.... Bryan Singer should be ashamed of himself for so fundamentally altering the story. Trask was not the original target but Dr. X himself. X was not alive in the future. Mystique is also growing up in Germany as the darkest most vile villain not a childhood playmate of X. The story smacks of disgusting from start to finish. Minus one or two cool fight scenes in the future, this movie should be forgotten and destroyed."
"karan-virgo92","10","6","9","13 September 2014"," A psychological insight into Superheroes!
","X-men Days of Future Past redefines the genre of smart superhero movie. The movie delves into the psychological depth of the characters that we have admired for decades. It is not just about a war between humans and mutants in this movie. It is more about correcting one's path and believing that by changing your decisions, one can have a better life to live.<br/><br/>All the characters face a dilemma of what they must do and what they should do. While Wolverine has a choice whether he should go in past to fix things, young Charles Xavier has a choice to make between pain or power. Mystique faces a choice between exacting revenge on those who hurt or forgive while Magneto faces a choice between following his path or following Charles's wishes. <br/><br/>Bolivar Trask clearly thinks of his own dwarfism as a bad form of mutancy and he wishes the world to be rid of the phenomenon. Smart choice to pick Peter Dinkalge for the role who clearly nails it. His own sentinel program is determined by his desire for ""true peace"" but it sounds hollow in the face of the destruction that the sentinel causes 50 years later.<br/><br/>This is definitely a smart movie and not just a popcorn flick. Evan Peters is too good as Magneto's illegitimate son Pietro Maximoff. The direction by Bryan Singer is top notch. Clever shifting of scenes in the final segment between past and the future. The momentum and the pace of both the stories is well maintained.<br/><br/>I go for a 10 rating for this Marvel venture. Keep it coming.<br/><br/>P.S.- Don't miss out on the Post Credit scene."
"skydragon-4","10","6","9","7 September 2014"," The best Comic-Book-Based Time Travel Movie I've ever seen
","Where do I begin with this movie. I watched this movie twice in two days back in May when it was first released. I had heard some good things about the movie but it far exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>First of all, I'm a huge X-Men fan. I've read the comics for years and most previous X-Men movies have taken a fair stab at trying to bring these Comic-Book superheroes to life on the big screen. Despite what others have said, X-Men 3: The Last Stand wasn't that bad of a movie in my opinion but I was really annoyed that they killed off Cyclops and Jean Grey. 'First Class' (The previous movie to this one) was a breath of fresh air.. A chance to have a new beginning if you will. It was a fantastic movie and I didn't think DoFP would be better. I was wrong. By miles.<br/><br/>As you may have heard, Days of Future Past is a time travel movie. I was wondering when they'd bring the future into this series (Being such a big part of the comics) and I'm happy that they finally decided to do so. However, the 'time travel' aspect of the movie is done so damn well that everyone I was watching the movie with (Who don't understand this kind of stuff) understood it all for once. It's a simple story and everything is easy to follow.<br/><br/>The movie is set in the near future and mutants are being hunted to near-extinction by powerful machines called ""Sentinels"". The few survivors realised that they can send the mind of a person back in time to influence events so as to change the future. This was initially done short-term to avoid Sentinels, but it was suggested that if someone's mind could be sent back far enough, they could stop the idea of Sentinels from ever having been conceived (The roots of the idea stem from a Scientist in the 70's). However, sending a mind back that far in time tears it apart, but there's one mutant who we know of who seems impervious to anything that you can throw at him - Wolverine. And thus, Wolverine's quest begins to change the past so that everyone can be saved in the future and we can all live in a better world.<br/><br/>I have to admit, the movie was tense in a lot of places. There was humour, lots of action, brilliant CGI, amazing character development and a story that kept you hooked from beginning to end. You just weren't sure what would happen and the last third of the movie was amazing to watch. There were some parts that stood out and literally made my jaw drop such as watching Blink do her thing during the first few and last few minutes of the movie (The one that can shoot out these purple portals). I really wish they had put more of her in this movie; Quicksilver busting out Magneto from the Pentagon; Old Professor X talking with the younger one; Magneto lifting the stadium; Actually, I'll stop there..<br/><br/>You can understand the story and you can relate to the characters. They all have their own reasons for doing what they do, from Professor Xavier taking the side of Humanity to Magneto thinking that a war is inevitable and that Mutants have to strike first. Then, there's Raven/Mystique who wants to avenge her fallen friends but is she willing to do so at the expense of the future?<br/><br/>I can't wait for the Blu-Ray for this movie to be released so I can watch it again in High-Definition. When watching this movie, remember to watch the after-credits scene that sets up the next movie which will be released in 2016. All I'll say is - About damn time that that character made an appearance!<br/><br/>10/10"
"joshua-303-92778","7","6","9","5 September 2014"," X-Men DOFP is the best blockbuster of 2014
","The X-Men franchise has set itself apart, among the gluttonous crop of superhero movies in recent years. After seven films, the characters are very familiar to us, and the latest installment is arguably the best yet, with its predecessor as the only other contender for that title. This is vastly better than the two stand-alone Wolverine films.<br/><br/>This movie wastes no time, putting us right in the action from the opening credits. The storyline is complex and frankly doesn't make an enormous amount of sense, but with a modest disbelief suspension makes for an entertaining couple of hours. It's also a decent science-fiction film in its own right.<br/><br/>The all-star cast does a satisfactory job. (I'm not really convinced by Jennifer Lawrence, sorry.) It's satisfying to have so many characters, which was a hallmark of the comic book series. We could easily be experiencing this story in the pages of a Marvel mag.<br/><br/>The film stumbles a bit when it begins to fall into the blockbuster trap of trying to pack in too many spectacular scenes. On the other hand, the musical score is far less obnoxious than we've been hearing in other recent Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>I was surprised to learn this was directed by the same person who helmed ""Superman Returns"". I thought that film was a disaster. So he seems to have evolved in his artistic skill.<br/><br/>These new X-Men movies demonstrate how to convincingly make prequels, in contrast to some other blockbuster franchises. One wonders why they gave the coveted Star Wars sequel to JJ Abrams when there are clearly better directors in the business."

","I only just about made it to the end of this film. In some respects I'm glad I waited it out as I always enjoy seeing Magneto rise up and wreak havoc in any format.<br/><br/>It was a close run thing however - I came very close to cutting my losses as we all had to endure the tiresome emotional crisis of the young Professor X. This film suffers from the blight of a tedious extended middle section where not an awful lot interesting actually happens - and there are prolonged periods of uninspiring dialogue. I found my mind wandering in the cinema as the director laboriously set up the clunky plot climax. It was all a bit tiresome.<br/><br/>One always needs to leave one's brain at the door in this type of film and that's OK, it's what we all expect, but I was expecting this film to outdo the other incarnations of the X-Men given the things I had read, and the glowing recommendations I got from colleagues.<br/><br/>Sadly it's all a bit pedestrian, and when you find yourself fidgeting and looking at your watch in the middle of an X-Men film you know that something has gone wrong somewhere. There are excellent performances here and there. Fassbender continues to ooze screen charisma and he captures the ruthless single mindedness of Magneto wonderfully well. Jackman continues to make Wolverine his own, but aside from that there's not really much memorable here.<br/><br/>This is the first X-Men I have gone to see in the cinema and I think it will be my last."

To be honest, I was a little bit scared by the very bad Wolverine sequel, that I didn't expect the the new x-men would be any good. However, the movie is great. The back and forth in time doesn't confuse the audience, fortunately, and the story doesn't get boring or gets you tired because of the too many action scenes. There are of course some questions that the film leaves unsolved in the end, but I guess we will have to wait for x-men Apocalypse to find out. An other thing that I didn't like, was the scenes that where shoot by a ""vintige"" camera as to show the time of the action, but they where too many, so less of them would have been better. Good performances, well most of them at least and nice costumes, very 70's. So, 7 out of 10, because it is enjoyable and interesting."

After researching X-Men: Days of Future Past I couldn't help but feel a certain amount of optimism.<br/><br/>This movie absolutely delivered! Right from the very beginning the viewer is launched into a world of dread and hopelessness. All of mutant kind has been driven to the point of extinction. With their options dwindling the X-Men decide to send on of their members to 1973 in order to try and undo the present.<br/><br/>Everything in the film is well done. The visuals are fantastic. The graphics are state of the art. The storyline is brilliant. There was never a point during the movie where I felt I knew what was going to happen next.

Another challenge that this movie masters well, is finding a character that the viewer will cheer for... it most definitely doesn't fall short. (Except for Sentinals. Sentinals are dicks.) Heck, even Tyrion Lannister, and Katniss Everdeen are in this movie! Generally, the faster I finish my popcorn the more exciting the film is, and I did stuff my face very quickly.<br/><br/>'Days Of Future Past' also continues the X-Men tradition of being politically and sociologically conscious and relevant, bearing a number of allegorical references that fit squarely with many issues faced in modern society.(Cue philosophical discussions here). The special effects are mighty, the humor is sharp and in abundance and the dialogue is alive & breathing.

"talarisw","10","7","11","25 May 2014"," Bryan Singer returns to the X-men franchise with a 7th installment where the x-men must travel back in time to stop a chain of robots from eliminating all mutants.
","This is the best movie in the series and of the year! Let me start off by saying I'm a huge fan of the x-men. I read the comics, I watched the 90's cartoon, their my favorite comic book title from Marvel and 2nd only to batman. The x-men film series is my personal favorite film series of all-time! I think 20th century fox has done a great job handling the series and I'm happy with every installment. But even though I couldn't wait to see this movie I was a little worried about the time line & continuity in this film, there were already continuity issue starting with ""first class"" but Singer said he wanted to fix those problems. And since this film has wolverine going back to 1973, I was worried about how that fits with ""origins"" and I was also worried about the fact that the sentinels were created in the 70's but no where to be found in the original x-men trilogy. But I'm very happy to say that the story works perfectly and dosen't really contradict the other films! Before I talk about the great actors and special effects I must talk about how great the story is and Singer did ""fix"" the continuity. First off they explained how professor X was able to walk after getting paralyzed in ""first class(FC) because that was one of the major continuity problems in that we saw Xaviar get paralyzed in ""FC"" but in flashbacks of ""origins"" & ""last stand"" which took place in the 80's he was walking but here they explain he can walk thanks to a serum by Hank so that gives a good explanation for that. They did a good job explaining how the sentinels fit into the previous story line, so in 1973 professor X was depressed & magneto was locked in prison so mystique was left on her own and she killed Trask but was briefly captured where scientist took her blood & 50 years later they used her blood to create sentinels that can shape shift to adapt to whoever their fighting. So that perfectly explains why there were no sentinels in the previous x-men films. Mystique killed Trask in '73 so no sentinels were created. And they didn't know that mystique's blood would be used to create unstoppable killer robots 50 years later. So in the background of X1, X2, X3 and the wolverine Trask industry was working on bringing back the sentinels until they had the technology to use mystique's blood for the sentinels. But this movie does make me wonder what happened in the original time line, I mean how did professor X get out of his funk & started the school again and how did magneto and mystique get out of custody but the good thing there's still like a 30 year gap between the events of '73 and the 1st x-men movie so a lot could of happened. So seeing a middle age professor X & Magneto in a flashback in ""last stand"" where they meet a child Jean Grey dosen't seem to be out of place in the continuity. And wolverine traveling back to 1973 dosen't contradict too much with ""origins"". Wolverine has the bone-claws like in origins and I like how they made him wake-up in the 70's, he had another life going on. I like when the women called him Jimmy which was revealed to be his real name in ""origins"" so I liked that connection. The only problem is that William Stryker in this film is a young man in his 20's or maybe early 30's but in ""origins"" he meets wolverine & Victor in Vietnam & he was in his 40's. But other then that it fits pretty well. Stryker probably met Wolverine & Victor in Vietnam and soon after joining him, wolverine left to be alone for 6 years. But since there was no specific year showed in ""origins"" you can be flexible there. My only criticism is that we don't see more of the horrible future but maybe it's for the best 'cause it was pretty dark & sad. But I think they could of explained a little more like how professor X came back alive after ""last stand"". I would've liked to see more of storm, iceman, colossus and Bishop. But at least we got to see them do some cool stuff with their powers. All the actors did a great job & despite playing wolverine for 6 movies Jackman is still awesome, his gruff personality is so appealing and I like that even in the horrible future he's still smoking his cigars. McAvoy & Fassbender are perfect as the younger Xaviar & Magneto. Peter Dinkalege is great as Bolivia Trask. I like how William Stryker works into story. I love the look of the sentinels, the ""future ones"" look really scary and the ""past ones"" looks perfect to the iconic comic book version. The plot is unpredictable and leaves you with doubt about if they can save the future. It's a really well written story with great emotional depth & strong performances from everyone. I love Jennifer Lawerence as mystique. I love the actor playing quicksilver, his look & personality was just like in the comics, he was funny and stoled every scene. I love how they hinted at magneto being his father like in the comics. I love the cameos at the end by Kelsey Grahmer as beast, James Mardeson as cyclops, the hot Anna Paquin as rogue and the sexy Famake Janeson as Jean Grey, as well as a cameo by Bryan Singer himself. Although it's kinda sad to know that the first 3 x-men movies didn't happen but at least wolverine remembers it. I like how the movie ended with many possibilities, no specific direction for the sequel. I love the post credit scene showing the next villain, ""apocalypse"" in ancient Egypt being worshiped as a god. A great film in a classic film series!"

","I liked everything about the movie from the beginning till the end. Although there were some plot holes, but considering how awesome the movie was it could be compromised.<br/><br/>Being a fan of X-men I went for the movie on the same day it was released, I had it in my mind that the movie would be lame as The Wolverine. But to my surprise it wasn't and in fact it was just the opposite.<br/><br/>Bit of humor here and there made the movie even more awesome.

","Brian Singer, Director of the first 2 Critical and Fan Praised X-Men Films, return to the Director's chair for ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" brought High Expectations. My Verdict – Singer and Company Delivered!!!<br/><br/>The movie does start out a bit slow in the first few minutes, but quickly picks up steam as Hugh Jackman's ""Wolverine"" is sent back to 1973, to try avoid the creations of the Evil Robot ""Sentinels"" which basically appear set to wipe out Mutants and Humans alike in the present day. The X-Men First Class Cast Members – James McVoy (Xavier), Michael Fassbender (Magneto), Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique), and Nicholas Hoult (Beast), reprise their roles for the 1973 setting, 11 years after the story of ""First Class"". The acting from the entire cast is pretty much wonderful, including newcomer Evan Peter's Quicksilver, a subject of on-line worry leading up to the film, is great!!! And special mention should also be given to Mark Camacho, who scenes as President Richard Nixon are well done! The 70's jokes and references are a treat, and the Special Effects are Great!<br/><br/>Simply Put – A Lot of Fun – X-Men fans should be very pleased – 3 ½ Stars out of 4!"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","7","11","22 May 2014"," Katniss Everdeen vs. Tyrion Lannister...
","That's what it all really comes down to in the end. Will she shoot him or not? Come on, it's Tyrion! No one could shoot him, not even the stone-cold assassin Raven's turned into. The reason why she WANTS to has something to do with Boliver Trask (Peter Dinklage) building machines called Sentinels from Mystique's DNA that allows them to adapt to any attack and therefore be unbeatable in the future. So Wolverine gets sent back to the 70's to prevent Trask from being assassinated so the future won't turn out so bleak for mutants and mutant supporters alike. In the immortal words of David Tennant's Doctor: it's a big ball of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey...stuff. Original director of the first two X-movies, Bryan Singer, knows what this franchise is all about. It's not only nice to welcome back the original X-movie theme/DNA strand opening credits/Cerebro door closing bit, but also he who kick-started all this. Oh, what could have been if he had done the third movie. Speaking of, this film (to the gratefulness of many) remedies a good chunk of what transpired in The Last Stand and made so many unhappy. But don't fret, Singer has said he's not erasing the past movies and he believes in ""multiverses"". <br/><br/>After a beginning, where a handful of new X-Men characters who we don't give a fig about die, we learn it's a total ""psyche!"" moment and they're all good. This happens again near the end of the movie. It really doesn't have much effect, as all the new mutants are forgettable and the only ones we care about are from the previous films. Stewart and McKellen are what really grounds these future scenes. More of Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, complete with potty mouth, is welcome after she was underutilized in Last Stand, but she's more just a means to an end here. It's Logan who gets to do all the time travel. His visit to the 70's allows for some nice/funny moments acknowledging the era he's in (lava lamps, water beds, the music!). Things are much more interesting in the past, with McAvoy as young Charles, Fassbender as young Erik and JLaw as young Mystique (sadly, she only really shares one moment with Hank/Beast). These actors are what made First Class so enjoyable/successful, so it's a good thing we spend the bulk of the movie with them. <br/><br/>McAvoy brings so many depths to Charles (who has found a serum that allows him to walk, but doing so takes away his abilities). He and Jackman play well off each other, and Charles gets to repay Logan for his telling him to eff off in the last movie. Fassy, meanwhile, plays a much more angrier Magneto here. So much so that he's willing to kill Mystique, the one whom he brought over to his side last movie. What scenes the two of them share are really good, it's just a shame they were opposing each other. No disrespect to Rebecca Romijn, who was a welcome cameo in First Class and did a decent in the previous movies, but Jennifer Lawrence imbues her character with so much more nuance. One can understand her motivations/conflict, and the big moment between her and Trask has suitable weight to it, given what's at stake. Not to mention she's picked up a slew of kick-arse moves that she uses to take down large numbers of enemies all at once. Her fight scenes are some of the stand-outs in the film - they're so imaginative/creative and never boring. Describing her as quite flexible/bendy is an understatement.<br/><br/>Jackman, as always, is easily likable in his most recognised role. He's gotten playing Logan down to an art by now. Despite the lack of 'snikt!' (as his past self's bone claws are adamantium-less), he still kicks a fair amount of arse. He shares some good scenes with Xavier, Lehnsherr and Hank. The past cast certainly elevates the movie. New character Peter/Quicksilver is mostly played for some funny visuals, though he does come in handy with his super speed. However, the scene in X2 when Nightcrawler attacks the White House remains the better of the two. Judging by my audience's reaction, this Quicksilver may indeed prove a hit with film goers, though I personally am more looking forward to seeing what Whedon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson do with the character in Avengers 2. I imagine/am hoping he'll have more character depth. Dinklage, who we all love, naturally makes the most of his role and does not feel like some cartoonish villain or anything. <br/><br/>The most note-worthy thing, cast-wise, is all the cameos we get of characters long-thought lost. It's an emotional/highly effective moment when we see Famke Janssen's Jean again (no longer the Phoenix), James Marsden's Scott (who's still got that great dynamic with Logan) and Anna Paquin's Rogue. While the first two prove that the events which made so many mad in The Last Stand have been corrected, the last one is a bit of a shame only because of how minuscule her screen time is. Sadly, Paquin's Rogue has always been criminally underused and (especially in Last Stand) done a disservice by the writing, but at least she and Bobby/Iceman (who finally does some ice-ramp forming/surfing in this film) get a happy ending. Actually, it seems almost everyone gets one, more or less (except for the poor X-Jet, which gets destroyed every movie), while the very end promises interesting things to come. While it's a shame Matthew Vaughn, who directed First Class (which I thought rejuvenated the series after it had gone stale), declined directing this one, Singer does a good job of bringing back the positive memories of the first two films. While I do prefer First Class and feel this film had some unnecessary characters/got a bit muddled, the good mostly outweighs the bad. This is an X-Men sequel right up there with X2 on the successful scale and should make most X-fans happy."

","It's not too out there to say that the x-men series is in a rut. First off the 3rd part of the original trilogy was lacking something, but was still okay Then came X-men first class, that was good on in a lot of ways, but was also filled with mistakes. Despite the fact that Fox was looking to make a romantic-comedy-action for teenagers the end result wasn't that bad. But to me it did succeed in – despite the great actors – making me like the new foundation x-men was set on. Then came the worst installment of the x-men saga Wolverine. I think the whole brand reached its lowest point with that film, despite the fact that it's a watchable film, but it was by far the worst of them all. Of course the films make money but Avengers proved that there is a whole lot more money to be made still with comic book films. Of course Fox wanted a piece of the pie too, but I'm sure they knew that you need quality to make lots of money, so they invested a lot and secured Bryan Singer for the director's chair. He was already around to produce and write First Class but this time around he got control of the whole film. Fox then okayed the x-men series most complex story for the film. Thought the script was written by Simon Kinberg, who already fell short with the 3 part back in the day but for some reason Singer trusted him with it. First off the film is good, maybe even the best yet. Of course the biggest question everyone has been asking is will it give the Avengers a run for its money and that's a harder question to answer. Compared to other comic book adaptations and other Marvel films the two are very different, so it's hard to compare them, but I have to point out the quality wise it's up there with Ironman. I don't think that it will be there money wise. They did rewrite the original story from the comic book, but that didn't cause problems. I was mostly worried about how they would sew the 5 x-men films together but that was done perfectly. So the story is okay. As is the script. There are humorous parts, but they aren't over the top. Just enough. The actors are genius, none of them forgot how to act since the previous installments. This was a give though cause the casting was always super. Evan Peters as Quicksilver is so good, that it almost becomes his one man show. I maybe just expected a little more from Peter Dinklage. Let's look at the other characters, as opposed to the other films Wolverine isn't completely in the main focus, and the funny thing is that this isn't a problem. Magneto, Xavier and Mystic step up to the plate, but just to sooth the fans he doesn't fade into the background. But this still brings us to one of the problems, there is not enough time for all the characters; It's one team but two time zones, some characters got larger roles like Mystic, and a few were left to fade away, but Singer manage to fix this problem, way better than with x-men 2 by having huge action scenes in the film. They are done well and are brutal. So we don't really have time to get into which characters are lost in the background. You're just whiplashed by the action, action that is not the least bit pointless. There is always a believable story behind each one. All in all it's a step forward from First Class, and it was a quality step too. It's not just a 5th part. Which is huge. So I give it a 9/10 Max - https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1"
"alwaysplanb","1","25","53","26 May 2014"," No Action!
","Being an X-Men fan, I was expecting superb action in the movie. Whereas the storyline is decent, the movie seriously lacks noteworthy action. This is an ongoing trend that movie goers in US are giving more weightage to story than action. And that's what probably drives the directors to focus more on script.<br/><br/>However, last thing we expect from an X-Men movie is inferior action. Even a single comics of X-Men, a single episode of X-men animation, has more action than this movie. Lack of action means all the fun has been dragged away this time. The only fight I really enjoyed was the slo-mo action sequence with QuickSilver. Now that was IMPRESSIVE!<br/><br/>Coming to plot. <br/><br/>Q1. Wasn't Quicksilver the son of Magneto? Then what's with the new story? <br/><br/>Q2. Why can't Kitty send Wolverine back in time to kill Trask before he creates Sentinel program? Or stop him from even being born?<br/><br/>Q3. What's with Magneto's mood. First he tries to kill Mystique. Failing which he tries to kill Nixon! Wouldn't killing Nixon only ascertain the inevitable?<br/><br/>Q4. The ending was most questionable. If the past is changed, wouldn't the future be changed in a PARALLEL universe instead of the one from which Wolverine's sent? OR, if there is NO PARALLEL universe, the future should have changed the moment Wolverine's consciousness was sent back. <br/><br/>Instead, the future remains unchanged for the same time for which the past is unchanged. So, basically you are applying the concept (timeline) of Parallel Universe WITHOUT ANY PARALLEL universe. Wow!<br/><br/>I know that Mindless action is appreciated by none. But please don't forget that it's a superhero movie for god's sake. See Avengers for example. Decent story, lots of comic moments and great action. Yet even with Sentinels in this movie, action is far from explosive.<br/><br/>If story is what you want from an X-Men movie, by all means do enjoy this one. But if you want decent action, you are better off watching X2 for the nth time than Days of Future Past."

OK, so here we go...we're enjoying the little reminder of the first two movie intro's (this one's in a similar style. We've had a bit of dramatic action... <br/><br/>I don't think it's really a spoiler to now tell you that this is where some ""time travel"" is involved. Aaaand...that's where I shot the director, your honour. How did Singer go from a good film maker, a director of fair detail, to THIS... :o/<br/><br/>Specifically, and again, I don't think I'm ""spoiling"" anything here; we here young ""Professor X"" speak a bit. Waitaminute...let me back up a minute or two first, before I get to it...In the future time, where we see Professor X and Wolverine have a conversation about imminent time travel, Patrick Stewart tells Wolverine, ""I was very different back then""... <br/><br/>...What he neglects to mention is that he has had some sort of lobotomy, or brain surgery...which has resulted in him speaking in a VERY near as damn it, full-on broad COCKNEY ACCENT when ""he"" was younger. When the hell was Xavier EVER been a cockney? As if this weren't enough of a travesty (incidently, I immediately had nightmarish Iron Man 3 flashbacks at this point lol), our younger ""Xavier"" uses the following phrases while talking to Wolverine: <br/><br/><ul><li>""Bloody"" (as in the swear word)...OK, I can let that slide...it'd be easier though, IF he didn't sound like he were talking about jellied eels... - ""P!!! off."" (again, sounding like he might, at any minute, ask you if he can have a CAP of tea). - ""F!!! off!"" (same deal with the accent). - ""Future sh!te."" Hence, my title to this review.</li></ul><br/><br/>The last three phrases are just SO out of character for Charles Xavier it's unreal. Plus, he obviously shouldn't sound anything like a cockney. For the love of all that is holy GIVE THIS FRANCHISE TO A STUDIO WHO CARES ABOUT GETTING IT RIGHT. I'm totally sick of this now... ..Yeah, I know it's a slim chance anybody with the power to change things might see my review, but in case you wondered, *that's* why I put that in capitals. <br/><br/>I love the X-Men, but that's not what this is. You're being lied to. A lot was changed for X1 & X2, but I could deal. Every film since then though, has been a smack in the face to the viewing public. Credit to the person who cast Kelsey as beast in X3, though...perfect choice for how BEAST should speak. There are good actors out there, all we need are some decent writers, and directors who care about detail getting the directing gigs again. Patrick Stewart, is pretty much just dialing it in now, in his film performances. As he did in the abomination that was ST Nemesis. <br/><br/>...If you could buy a Malibu beach house off the back of a terrible movie script though, would you say no to the job? ;oD Not many would. Anyway, I waffle. But seriously ladies and gents. I advise against paying to see this ""movie"" if you care anything for film. Even ""movies"" shouldn't get character details THIS incorrect. And let's bare in mind, this is meant to be kiddie friendly, and the more you feed the wh*remongers a.k.a. the MPAA and the BBFC (who at this point BOTH need to be given their marching orders), the more they'll keep crossing the line, resulting in screwing up society further still. The power to improve the quality of viewing material (or listening material) is in your hands. Use it. And, my advice is see this movie, if you must....BUT...for the love of common sense DON'T PAY anything to see it. It's up to you though..."

","With all the excitement of MIB 3, we get a time travel X-men because they killed off too many people and wanted to get Jennifer Lawrence in a blue body suit by expanding Raven's roll, pun intended. It seems the humans have gained the upper hand and the mutants are on the ""brink of extinction"" which would also kill the franchise, something they attempted with this film. They must stop the humans from getting Raven's DNA which allows them to build better mutant killing machines.<br/><br/>Only Logan/Wolverine Man (Hugh Jackman) can go back in time, or at least his mind. Appropriately, he wakes up in 1973 a bit groggy with a lava lamp by his side and Roberta Flack eerily singing ""First Time Ever I saw Your Face"" a song more popular in 1972. Logan must get the team back together and convince them of the mission. Much of the film consisted of springing Magneto, which wittily included another era song by Jim Croce. Unfortunately they ran out of royalty checks and couldn't continue with that fun.<br/><br/>The action/comedy/drama was a let down from previous films. While the film maintained the special effects, I felt Jennifer Lawrence's acting talents were wasted, although I predict she will take over as the slow motion/ stop action mode blue skinned princess from that Avatar blue thing.<br/><br/>The film had potential, but the script fell short.

Everything that was done in this film was unequivocally perfect in terms of a comicbook film, it is basically the infinity war of X-men.<br/><br/>The visuals were perfect, they obviously aren't the main attraction in the film but they were more than sufficient, from the sentinels to the fire scenes to the levitating stadium, everything, it was all so great.<br/><br/>The performance and the impact of the message that both Xavier and Magneto had overall was exquisite. The best pieces of this film that complete it are the speech scenes. You also get a perfect blend of action and such a great score with this film being in the hands of Bryan Singer. Although the plot is very familiar to James Cameron's Terminator: Judgement Day with a shapeshifter that threatens the outcome of a particular species. It obviously isn't anything new but for an xmen film plot it is absolutely genius.<br/><br/>This is definetely up there with Watchmen, The Dark Knight, etc. Truly an ambitious comicbook film.

","""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" begins solidly if unremarkably. New and well-known characters are introduced. A legendary enemy is revealed. A plot linking present with past is established. This is engaging stuff, and the film quickly sets itself up as an engrossing adventure with a serious tone and high stakes. It all makes for something entertaining but not special.<br/><br/>Something happens along the way, however, and ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" begins to resonate stronger and appeal more deeply. In a scene where the Charles Xavier of the past is confronted by his future self, the film ceases to be a run-of-the-mill superhero adventure. It becomes the story of a man with the power to impact the world. It becomes an observation of his journey and his impact on the characters and world around him, past, present, and future. It becomes the human story of understanding fear and embracing hope.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer's spectacular ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is more than a sequel to ""X-Men: First Class"" or a prequel to ""X-Men."" It is a wrap-around event that courses through and changes the world of the previous films. It is a grand piece of entertainment that respects what has already been established in the franchise's universe and opens up a dynamic future. Pulsing with memorable and exciting set- pieces, the film is a solid action outing but, more importantly, has the soul of a character piece. It observe the journeys, the developments, the shifts, and the fulfillment of its colorful, comic book characters.<br/><br/>The story is involving, but the story's characters are its highlight. They generate humor, warmth, anger, and excitement. Their arcs are tragic, epic, and triumphant. Their eyes are haunted and hopeful. They are the comic book gods of a new Olympus, but they are as human as their audience.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer is blessed with a cast that is able to at once communicate not only the fantasy, mutant elements of their characters' bodies and brains but also the disparate humanity punctuating their actions. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen serve as godfathers and guardians of their younger charges. James McAvoy and Micheal Fassbender are both brilliant and burdened. They are ideally cast as broken men on separate paths.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult both capture the vitality and impetuous juvenility of youth. They have suffered loss that colors their arcs, and it shows in their words and reactions. Evan Peters, as Quicksilver, is an underutilized revelation with spirit and humor.<br/><br/>Anchoring all of this is Hugh Jackman. Here, he is asked to stay in the background, but his charisma and knowing ferocity hold the rest of the cast, and the film, together. Jackman's Wolverine is now a leader and a less an antihero. His mantle of teacher, like that of Xavier's in the previous films, suits him well.<br/><br/>Singer turns in a film composed of exhilarating action beats and satisfying character drama captured with a subtle visual style. His 1970s are subtly swinging and sepia-toned. They are as vibrant as the cinematic world makes them out to be. The future is dark and cold. It is drained of color in crisp contrast to the 1970s.<br/><br/>Singer's tendency to shoot his cast in closeup accentuates the importance of character over spectacle. It is a refreshing change of pace for this type of film. Cinematography, editing, and score all complement each other and sell the film's overall quality.<br/><br/>All of this results in one of the most accomplished and, in short, best superhero films ever made. The drama, the humor, the action are all sharp and well-measured. The production is outstanding with its blend of artful comic book flash and focus.<br/><br/>Of all these well-appointed elements, what makes ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" so excellent are its themes and emotional center. The film is more than a superhero romp. It is a film about struggle: not just the struggle against larger-than-life enemies, but the personal struggle with what human beings are and what they are meant to be. It is about struggle against the march of time and memory. Most importantly, it is about the triumph of hope over fear and over that struggle. This beating thematic heart of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is the reason the film succeeds at such high levels. It is the grandly important center of a fantastic film."

","Hey, Days of Future Past. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>You have Singer back at the Helm adapting one of Claremont's most loved story arcs (and really one of the shortest) into pure pop corn chomping escapism.<br/><br/>But then. he had to do a great job on it. X-Men is a beloved title. The X-Men spinoffs are beloved. Days of Future Past is one of the X-Stories that gets crowned time and again by us nerds.<br/><br/>Singer walked in there knowing that if he messed it up he'd be lynched by fanboys and that is an extremely embarrassing way to go. There are certainly more painful ways to die, but few that are more humiliating than death-by-fan-boy.<br/><br/>Thankfully he did pull it off. He adapted it nicely to fit into the established chronology of the X-Franchise and he did with style and grace.<br/><br/>You get glimpses of favorite characters, epic battles in the future, the return of characters we loved from the original franchise, a fun romp through the 70s and, just because he is THE fan favorite, Logan gets to time travel instead of Kitty. Besides, neither this Shadowcat nor Ellen Page have ever seen the 70s.<br/><br/>And to top it all off you get a fun new character. Sure, Quicksilver was more true to form in Age of Ultron, but the X-Franchise version of him is utterly entertaining.<br/><br/>It is a win on all counts.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, like X2, it's the sequel that stands out before the reboot does a Last Stand swan dive into horrible.<br/><br/>So, as with X2, if you are going to watch one X-Reboot, watch Days of Future past. 10 out of 10, pure geeky entertainment."

","'X-Men: Day's of Future Past' has a great deal of potential. It's the first comic book film in a long while that feels as close as one of these films can to being a fully realized story with convictions and characters. This is no small feet at all. There could very well be a four star film in the DNA of 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. It has brave ideas about destiny and it tackles them in smart ways that are deeper than most other comic book films. The problem with this film is that it exists in the same climate that has given us 'The Avengers'. 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' should exist as it's own entity because it would strengthen the film and it's message. Unfortunately I feel that like it's equally excellent predecessor 'X-Men: First Class' that this film can't quite reach greatness because of the confines of a franchise. Ideas inevitability fall second fiddle to action figure characters, video game dialogue in the action scenes, and worst of all the need to make endless sequels...<br/><br/>'X-Men' has the benefit of longevity and it really can be a benefit. One great thing about this film is that it knows we already have solid relationships with these characters by this point in the series and it doesn't need to introduce us to them again. This is a great relief. What it does need to do though is do new things with the characters. I think some slack is given to these 'X-Men' films because they have such perfect casts. Maybe it is merely a matter of prejudice but I am drawn to Magneto the most and I felt this film is one of the worst in getting the essence of this character correctly out of all the 'X-Men' films. I love 'First Class' in that it took the time to really explore the friendship of Charles and Magneto but because of sequelitis these two had to have their lines drawn in the sand by the end of the film. I wish we could have visited Magneto with a fresher take and explore some of the intricacies of his personality. Sequelitis doesn't let us do this however. Magneto has to be a villain capable of holding up a tent pole franchise. It doesn't give the audiences or Michael Fassbender credit. And I have no complaints about Fassbender, he's brilliant but the character needs work in this script. I felt it didn't do anything new with the characters. I thought the choices in the script really made Magneto look really stupid. I like the fact that the film doesn't follow the crappy tropes used in time travel films but Magneto doesn't listen to the warning of the future even though he believes it. I hate the fact that as soon as Magneto enters the peace conference that he starts up a huge ruckus that gives Trask exactly what he wants to get government support for the sentinel program. Magneto has always had this anger but it's been a righteous anger. He isn't someone who goes out and throws all his cards on the table as he does in this film<br/><br/>I find that like in my review of 'First Class' I have to put a lot of criticism into my discussion of the ending. The last two X-Men films have been good until the endings where they need to hint a sequel with a wink in the eye. Doesn't the movie not work at all if you don't have either Magneto or Mystique there at the school when Logan wakes up in the present? The whole point of the movie is that people are not shackled to destinies that cannot be avoided. We are supposed to have faith in these characters that they could be redeemed and choose a more righteous path. In the end by their omission from that final scene we are lead to believe that they don't make the right choice presumably so you could have them back as villains in a sequel. And then we find out that this movie which was supposed to be about redemption is just another comic book film about nothing but making sequels.<br/><br/>These seem like rough criticisms and to be fair they are. They are big detriments to this film. However like 'First Class' what the film gets right it excels at. The acting is all top notch even with the characters with lackluster motivations. The films' strong central concept of destiny is so brilliantly dealt with that I feel cheated with this ending. This may be why I love 'X-Men' because they are so much about themes and ideas. I get the feeling though that some at Fox don't think we are smart enough to be trusted with ending those ideas on their natural conclusion."

","I am a big X-Men fan but what a disappointment. I grew up on the comics, the cartoon and loved most of the films. X-Men Days of Future Past tries too hard to pack in the emotional layer. I appreciate the 15,000 jobs it created and hundreds of thousands of hours of work...but the script is so weak. I never roll my eyes but this was unreal. When characters were killed I felt no connection due to the weak acting. Jennifer Lawrence didn't seem to be in the right place while filming. The story was so convoluted and the visuals became the only reason to continue on. $200,000,000 and this is what they create. They need to get some new talent injected into this franchise. When I heard people at the end gasp, ""oh my God"" about Jean being alive...what did they expect? All the X-Men would be alive due to stopping the assassination which thus stops the Sentinels from being created. After seeing Rogue, Storm, Beast...why not Jean? Couldn't they have tried harder? 15,000 people involved with that much money focused could have really made a dent in cancer research rather than another clichéd film."

","After Matthew Vaughn's X-Men: First Class (2011) injected a bit of life back into the X-Men franchise, any further instalments faced the headache of what to do with a bunch of fantastic actors playing the same characters decades apart. Inspired by the 1981 Uncanny X- Men comic of the same name, Days of Future Past switches between a nightmarish, dystopian future overrun by giant sentinels, and the boogie nights of the 1970's. We get the best of both worlds, and thankfully, in his seventh appearance over the course of 14 years as his most recognisable character, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine inhabits them both.<br/><br/>After narrowly escaping a sentinel attack in the near-future, a band of mutants including the returning Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Kitty Pride (Ellen Page) meet up with Wolverine, Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Magento (Ian McKellen), Storm (Halle Berry) et al to hatch a plan before the next inevitable attack. Kitty transfers the mind of Wolverine back to 1973, where a young Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is soon to assassinate Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), setting off a chain of events that could result in the apocalypse. The only problem is, the young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is depressed and mansion-bound, still struggling to deal with his powers and the loss of the use of his legs. They also need to help of Magneto (Michael Fassbender), who is imprisoned in a plastic cell for allegedly assassinating John F. Kennedy.<br/><br/>For all it's time-travelling gobbledegook, Days of Future Past doesn't spend too much time trying to explain the mechanics behind it. Like Rian Johnson's mind-bending Looper (2012), it recognises the folly in attempting to spell it out for you. When you look at it under a microscope, time-travel makes little sense in movies as it is, so it's best to accept what you're seeing and move on. McAvoy's Xavier even dismisses Wolverine's ramblings as 'future-s***e'. This frees up more time in an already packed movie to concentrate on the damaged Xavier, brought to life by another fantastic performance from McAvoy. If First Class was Magneto's origins, this is Professor X's, showing a scared, conflicted and broken man and how he became the father to mutants he is when embodied by Patrick Stewart.<br/><br/>Of all the many mutants on show, some are not given as much time as their name would suggest. Storm, Anna Paquin's Rogue, and most notably, Ian McKellen's Magneto are somewhat left out to dry, while Nicholas Hoult's Beast, Kitty Pride, and a first appearance for Evan Peters' Quicksilver, are more prominent, and thrive in their larger roles. Trask, a rather fascinating villain thanks to the performance of Dinklage, is left undeveloped. We glimpse into his mind and ambitions, but there's little clarity given to his motivation. But with a film this packed with characters, it would take four hours or more to explore them all, and some inspired set-pieces pepper the film at the points where you start to think the plot will make your head explode. The (possibly) plot-hole laden climax aside, it seems like the franchise is as good as it was at the end of X2 (2003), seemingly serving to delete all the poor decisions made in returning director Bryan Singer's absence. Now, the wait for X-Men: Apocalypse.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"anishwicks","7","2","2","28 August 2014"," Days of future past vs what I expected it to be like.
","I expected a lot after reading the reviews and watching the trailers and all but from the minute the movie started I knew that I had been tricked. <br/><br/>First of all the beginning of this movie wasn't as great as the beginning of first class. Due to this weak start my expectations for the rest of the movie lowered. A film like this needs a good beginning, which I thought the dark knight movies gave us. Days of future past gives us a very messy start and one might find it hard to concentrate or to watch the beginning because there was too much happening everywhere all together. There's something happening here then something else happens there and then we completely forget what just happened before that.<br/><br/>The acting was OK, but the directing was bad. Mostly because it's not possible to see most parts because it's really really dark. I do understand that they've done that on purpose as to show the darkness that there living in but seriously couldn't they make it just a little bit less darker. Also the slow motion, I loved the slow motion in the beginning half of the film. That part was breathtaking and it was one of my favorite parts of the entire movie ( of course I mean the pentagon part). But as you go more and more into the movie you can realize that almost half of the movie is in slow motion, some of it unnecessary.<br/><br/>The story was OK. It wasn't thought through well. Firstly it didn't make much sense. The story at the beginning half made it look like the story could have a really good prestige like, shocking ending but ended weirdly and not making sense at all. I have no idea how they are going to make a sequel for this with that ending. If they do make a sequel , I don't think it will have a lot to do with this. Also some parts of the movie were slow making it a bit boring. <br/><br/>I really preferred first class in all ways ( this didn't even have any humor at all.) anyways it was watchable but not what you might expect it to be."
"The-Social-Introvert","7","2","2","24 August 2014"," Good Fun
","I watched X-Men: Days of Future Past in the cinema in 2D as a conclusion of a 7 day mutant movie marathon. Yes, that's 7 says of watching X-Men movies – one per day. That's quite a tall order for myself seeing as though I was never really into the movies (loved the 90's cartoon though) and I must say I was pretty burnt out by the time the end credits started rolling for The Wolverine. Being dragged along to the film this weekend meant I had to watch/re-watch all the previous installments which I'll admit is not something I had fun doing.<br/><br/>The first two films were very important for comic book movies. Along with Spiderman 1 and 2 they paved the way for the current superhero crave. I somewhat enjoyed them on my recap whilst acknowledging that they are children's movies, meaning I had to adjust my mentality whilst watching. The third had potential but was ultimately disappointing due to a number of creative decision. First Class was a much better effort with an exceptional cast – it felt fresh and reignited the franchise.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the Wolverine movies.<br/><br/>The first thing you'd notice about Days of Future Past is who's in it. You have the likes of Ian McKellen, Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackman, Ellen Page, Patrick Stewart and Shawn Ashmore. Whoa. That's a roster that would make Wes Anderson blush. The film handles its impressive cast pretty well, and most of the actors seemed invested in their characters. There are obviously people who would be disappointed with certain people not getting enough screen- time. I myself was a little upset that Ian McKellen wasn't around for much – though he did get an awesome moment against a bunch of sentinels. A lot of the 'now' actors hog a lot of the screen, like Fassbender and Lawrence, but that's OK since they are pivotal to the story. Wanna see more McKellen, CineRanter? Go and watch X-Men 2.<br/><br/>Performances all round are good. Jackman is on fine form once again as Wolverine, and his character opens up a lot more than before once he makes his trip down to the past. The Magnetos and Professor Xs delivered flawlessly again, and there was good supporting work from the likes of Peter Dinklage and Nicholas Hoult. 'Old' Magneto was played with subtle brilliance by McKellen, who gave of an air of compunction and regret, whilst his counter-part was fuelled with anger and drive. However, I could have done without Ellen Page's Japanese porn star-like squealing in the sending-back scene. I wasn't too impressed with Jennifer Lawrence either. Her character, ever since First Class, has been written much more differently from the first X-Men movies. Despite there being a huge gap in time, where a person can obviously change, Mystique is no longer cold andscary? She's far too open in this and a change in voice or something could have helped separate the character from the actress. I even though the makeup was a bit off. Mystic suddenly becomes involved in some kind of love triangle which was not presented previously.<br/><br/>As far as the story goeswell, time travel is very hard to get right. Only a few films have done it perfectly, such as 12 Monkeys, and there are undoubtedly going to be 'plot-holes' galore. Days of Future Past leave the idea of fate/destiny open (that is until we see Apocalypse) and other aspects of time travel are just not dealt with which is an ideal way to avoid confusion. If we're going to try and think scientifically about all this then none of the X-Men movies would be with us. The premise is good – The X-Men send Wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history (hint hint) and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants (nudge nudge) – and the execution is satisfactory. It clears up some mess from previous instalments pretty well and a lot of continuity errors can be dismissed by the fact that the First Class set of characters and in a different universe to the 'old' X-Men (and it seems the film says a big ""Fuck you!"" to Brett Ratner at times). The movie's two-and-a-bit hours drifts at a consistent pace with the cast of characters moving from set-piece to set-piece in flashy fashion. Humour is blended with action and drama seamlessly (Oh, that groovy 70's tune!) and there are Easter-eggs plentiful to please the hard-core fans. Not to mention some special cameos. One thing I really enjoy in fantasy films is when real life events are incorporated. I'm of course talking about the JFK bullet- bending material which made me chuckle.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of modern action films, you can actually see what is going on in the fight scenes (looking at you Winter Solider). Someone clearly threw the Shaky Cam out of the window, and it's a beautiful thing. The 'future' fight scenes were great eye candy (especially those portals) and the 'past' ones were grounded and consistently spread out. There was no 'epic' end fight scene as I expected after seeing Singer's first two X-Men films which makes it easier for the next movie not to try and one- up it, which is becoming a problem with comic book movie sequels. Also, Marvel fans may have an Avengers-esque déjà vu with the post credit scene teasing a 'big baddie'.<br/><br/>Full Review: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/2014/05/27/movie-review-x- men-days-of-future-past/"
"wahl-jonathan","10","2","2","30 May 2014"," Days of Future Past, More Than Just the Title
","Rarely do I ever go into a movie with great expectations only to have them exceeded. ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is one of those films, and that's definitely saying something considering the run that comic book films have been on since the 2000s, and a lot of stinkers that have come out of Hollywood (""X-Men: The Last Stand"" being one example). I enjoyed ""X-Men: First Class"", though originally I was a bit put off by the premise of it. That film proved my pretense of it to be very wrong, however, its sequel far outdoes it.<br/><br/>""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is perhaps one of the best comic book films ever made. In a market saturated with comic book films, it can be difficult to make something that truly stands out, and this one does just that. This one not only serves as a sequel to ""First Class"", but it also serves as a sequel to the highly anticipated but exceedingly disappointing ""The Last Stand"". It brings together cast members from ""First Class"" and ""The Last Stand"" in a beautiful swan song for this series. If this is the last X-Men film for awhile, then the series has definitely ended on a high note. If you're a comic book fan or an X-Men fan, I highly recommend it. 10/10 Top notch action, acting, visuals, story, and direction. SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT! SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT! SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT! SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT! SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT! SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!<br/><br/>While the concept of ""DoFP"" borrows a lot from the first two ""Terminator"" films with the grim opening on a dark and barren ruin that was the world as we know it being oppressed by machines and the ""time travel"" device being used as a means to alter history, it makes that concept its own. Instead of Logan literally going back in time, Kitty Pride uses her power to send Logan's present consciousness back in time to his 1973 counterpart so that he may prevent the Sentinels from becoming operational as they are in the present day. Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Nicolas Hoult, Jennifer Lawrence, and Michael Fassbender are an excellent leading ensemble. They all give top notch performances as their characters, and it's good to see Logan's character arc finally complete. Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen are spectacular as always reprising their roles as Charles Xavier and Magneto, respectively, from the first three films of the 2000s. The film's visuals are varied. The present day is very dark and foreboding while 1973 is brighter with the sense of an incoming darkness given the viewer's knowledge of 50 years later already established. The ""Forrest Gump"" aspects of integrating the characters into actual historic events are a nice touch as well, continuing and furthering that motif from ""First Class"". James McAvoy as Charles in 1973, dealing with the difficulty of the times, is brilliant. Granted the idea is a bit cliché, but considering its Charles Xavier, the most optimistic and positive thinking character we've encountered in this entire series who has lifted up so many of the characters being pessimistic and cynical just shows what McAvoy is capable of as a performer. Charles in 1973 is using a special treatment created by Hank McCoy (Beast) to allow him the use of his legs, but it simultaneously negates his telepathy. Charles willingly accepts that, because he senses all the pain and suffering of the world during that time. He uses that treatment as an escape. Ironically its Logan, someone he raised up from that frame of mind, who returns the favor in a way and raises Charles up from that hole. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique...need I say more? She's brilliant. Rebecca Romijn brought the character to life and made her one of my favorites, but Jennifer Lawrence perfected Mystique for me. Much like Charles, in this we see Mystique on the losing end of her own internal struggle. Michael Fassbender is a brilliant counterpart to Sir Ian McKellen as Magneto, and is fast becoming yet another one of my favorite actors. Ever since his role in ""Inglorious Basterds"" he's never ceased to entertain.<br/><br/>10/10 Top notch action, performances, visuals, and story."
"JenRe","8","2","2","29 May 2014"," Excellent, Must-Watch Movie
","For those of you who have trouble following movies or plots, you may want to pay more attention than usual or just skip it. But for those who are X-Men die-hards, this is a must see! I mean seriously, if you haven't already seen it, you are missing out. First, lets talk about the acting! Hugh Jackman is wonderful as always, but the real star of this film was James McAvoy. He was absolutely brilliant and was able to pull off such a hard role to play. Michael Fassbender was also wonderful as was Jennifer Lawrence. Now, to the story. There are some really silly parts to the story that kind of made no point. Spoiler Alert (quit reading now): Like for example the whole JFK thing was not needed. Surely they could have come up with something better as to why Eric was imprisoned rather than poking at a tragic death of one of our Presidents, especially the whole mutant thing. There are other parts that bothered me but they were so small that it didn't kill the movie. The story was solid and helped piece so many things together. There are a few moments that really made me get excited throughout the movie. For example: Jean Grey!!! I mean thank goodness she is back!! The movies without the full X-Men crew is really hard to get behind and enjoy. I had missed Jean so much. Also, the moment between the young Charles and the old Charles is pretty fantastic and is storytelling at its finest. The scene is one of the best X-Men moments in the history of the comics and movies. However, there are questions that remain!! What happened to Raven?? Did she give Wolverine his metal claws as Stryker?? Does Wolverine even have metal claws when he wakes up? What has happened since 1973?? The ending, with Scott and Jean being alive, pretty much wipes out the other 3 previous X-Men movies altogether. It gives Singer a clean slate to work with if he continues with the series. Overall, this was an awesome movie and I really want to go watch it again. Don't wait to rent it: Go see it now in theaters!!"
"fredschaefer-406-623204","10","2","2","26 May 2014"," The X-Men are back in a big way.
","X-MEN:DAYS OF FUTURE PAST really brings the franchise back in a big way after the sour taste many fans had after LAST STAND and WOLVERINE:ORIGINS, which most felt were lackluster. X-MEN:FIRST CLASS did a good job of getting the series back on track, but many of us were left with the notion there was work left to do. After seeing Bryan Singer's DAYS OF FUTURE PAST I can say with certainty that this is the best X-Men movie of them all and a real contender for best comic book movie ever-although THE DARK KNIGHT and THE AVENGERS are still very much in contention for the title. <br/><br/>What makes DAYS OF FUTURE PAST so great:<br/><br/>It perfectly expresses the idea that as a group, the X-Men are the down and dirty combat grunts of the comic universe. The Avengers and the JLA are made up of A list heroes, world beaters who come together in the face of some titanic threat, while the mutants are scrappy misfits, many of them with working class origins and with more than a few neurotic personalities and issues among themselves, but except for the Fantastic Four, they are more of a family than any of the others. They use stealth whenever possible and are not afraid of being underhanded if that is what is takes to get the job done. <br/><br/>It unites both the universes of the early X-Men films and the later FIRST CLASS and brings back Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, along with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, as they desperately try to rewrite history from the vantage point of a hellish future ruled by the mutant killing Sentinels. They also put Hugh Jackman's Wolverine back front and center in the action as it is his consciousness that is sent back to his 1973 body, where he will try to unite Professor Xavier and Magneto and prevent the murder of the Sentinel's inventor, Bolivar Trask, by Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique, which sets in motion events that will lead to the genocide of the mutants. All the previous X-Men films are referenced and virtually every character in the franchise makes an appearance at some point. This leads to a few inevitable logic and plot holes, the kind that drive some fans up the wall and across the ceiling- how is Professor X alive and in Patrick Stewart's body in DAYS OF FUTURE PAST when everyone saw him utterly destroyed by Jean Grey in LAST STAND? Not even the post credit scene from that film would explain it. <br/><br/>Fight scenes that come as close as any movie to truly capturing the feel of the epic battles of the comics; I'm specifically talking about the battle in the future that opens the movie where the surviving X-Men including Bishop, Storm, Iceman, Blink, Sunspot, and Warpath take on a squad of Sentinels. Each mutant's power is highlighted, but I really liked the way Blink used her portals to give the X-Men an edge. Then there is the scene where we see the action from the point of view of Evan Peters's Quicksilver as he moves so fast that everything else, including bullets speeding through mid air, appear to stand still. This might be my favorite scene from any comic book movie ever.<br/><br/>How it rectifies some mistakes of the past: Welcome back Jean Grey and Cyclops; their reunion scene with Wolverine at the end was the icing on the cake for me. And then there is Richard Nixon pulling a gun.<br/><br/>Of course some characters didn't get as much screen time as I would have hoped-Oscar Sy as Bishop, Hallie Berry back as Storm, Booboo Stewart as Warpath, Adnan Canto as Sunspot, and especially Evan Peters as Quicksilver, who nearly steals the film. Peter Dinkledge could have been been given some better lines as Bolivar Trask, the movie's main bad guy, since we know what he can do on GAME OF THRONES. <br/><br/>And the logic holes,it wouldn't be a comic book movie without them, like how could Ellen Page's Rogue keep contact with Wolverine's consciousness in the past for days on end? Maybe time moves at a different pace in the future. And maybe Charles Xavier is using his highly developed powers of telepathy to make everyone see him in Patrick Stewart's body or it really was his twin brother who was comatose at the end of LAST STAND. <br/><br/>As for the post credit scene, everyone had better go read THE AGE OF APOCALYPSE and get up to speed."
"vijayant_venky","8","2","2","24 May 2014"," X Men - Days of Future Past Review: stellar cast, stellar performances, stellar cinema
","First off, I loved it. When I was going into the theatre I really wasn't sure how this one is going to be considering the last Wolverine was a disaster for me. But I did have hopes from this perfect ensemble even though the trailer didn't work for me.<br/><br/>X Men – Days of Future Past has everything that an X Men fan loves and longs for. If you loved X Men First Class, this movie is a treat for you and is sure to blow your mind away.<br/><br/>Take a bow Bryan Singer for creating and presenting this spectacle to us. Kudos to the director, Bryan, for pulling this off brilliantly because I found the plot to be most complex and yet most entertaining so far! This X Men brings all the great actors from the X Men Trilogy, X Men First Class and others to you and that includes Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence (I am in love with you all over again miss), Halle Berry, Ellen Page, Nicholas Hault, Peter Dinklage of GOT fame, Evan Peters, Josh Helman.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I was conspicuous at a lot of times while watching the film and by the end I actually found this flabbergasting a lot more amazing. Why was I flabbergasted? Well because there's time travel, quantum physics and a hell lot of characters (I am not complaining even one bit)<br/><br/>The overall plot of the movie can be summed in this next statement. Wolverine is sent by X Men to about 50 years in the past in order to prevent the doom for humans and mutants. In the present, a war between mutants and non-mutants has led to massive destruction in the world. A few mutants who have survived are battling against Sentinels, the terrifying new soldier robots. Professor X played by Patrick Stewart, realizes that time-travel to 1973 could probably save their destinies.<br/><br/>Kitty Pryde played by my favorite Ellen Page has the power to take X men into the past and she leverages this power at the command of the Professor X take Wolverine back to 1973. And in just a moment, the X Men go forward to the past or an alternative present. Wolverine is required to stop Mystique, or Raven, beautifully and effortlessly played by Oscar winning actress Jennifer Lawrence with whom I have fallen in love with all over again. Mystique attempts to assassinate the anti-mutant scientist Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), creator of the Sentinel programme, at a peace conference in Paris. As things turn out, Mystique is captured and her metamorphic properties were decanted through some horrifying and hideous scientific means.<br/><br/>Why does Wolverine need to stop Mystique? So that none of this would happen and the future of humans and mutants is not a dystopia. However he needs Magneto and Xavier's younger selves to join him, however they don't remember or recognise him in the past. What follows is prison breaks, astral projections, and several grisly mutant deaths. Truthfully, this incredibly ambitious mix of character, plot and spectacle could very easily go horribly wrong but not when Bryan Singer is at play.<br/><br/>There is a particular bullet scene which is created in absolute slow motion and though the creators have done a job worth an applause, I actually didn't find the scene as amusing as my fellow movie watchers in the theater did. In fact to be honest, had the same scene been enacted by an Indian filmmaker, everyone would have laughed it off calling it a Rajnikant stunt.<br/><br/>One of my favorite sequence in the movie was the climax sequence wherein an entire stadium is uprooted and fenced around the White House in order to kill the United States President for he is guilty of ordering a Sentinels program aimed at vanishing mutants.<br/><br/>Performances are incredible especially by James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Jennifer Lawrence who made us believe in each and every emotion of Mystique and we witness each emotion even through the body hugging quasi-nudity and you know there's nothing wrong in being sexy. Though Hugh Jackman was at his best however I really felt that other strong characters and performances did steal the limelight. I wish an astonishing actress like Halle Berry had more screen time but I understand that the writers and Singer wanted to be leal to the script and the plot.<br/><br/>The sets, costumes and action sequences are simply out of this world and you will be glued to your sit to not miss even a second of this brilliance put on screen.<br/><br/>My recommendation – you have to go and watch this one even if you are not an X Men fan for you will be on the edge of your seat at so many times."

","In X-Men: Days of Future Past, Director Bryan Singer presents to the cinematic world not just another superhero movie, but a tour de force of a movie going experience. He achieves this by integrating exceptional storytelling and in-depth character development with the perfect balance of faithfulness to both the franchise and comic book. It is realized through world class support from the entire cast and crew. Notable performances are given by Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence. As a newcomer to the franchise, Peter Dinklage as Dr. Boliver Trask does a great job giving fans a villain they will have no choice but to love hating. Special mention goes out to Hugh Jackman. In Days of Future Past he truly delivers the essence of Wolverine, portraying with equal aplomb his every flaw and strength. <br/><br/>If you are unfamiliar with the franchise, an afternoon spent viewing X-Men (2000), X2 (2003) and X-Men: First Class (2011) just prior to attending a show should serve to enhance your enjoyment of the movie; hands down the best of them all. If you are even a casual fan you will not be disappointed. I will leave it to the die-hards and the curmudgeons to quibble over flaws; yes, of course there are some (though not many, to be sure). Days of Future Past is a must see. It will remain a timeless classic not only in the genre of superhero movies, but of film as a whole."
"gumperman","10","2","2","23 May 2014"," X-Men is back, and better than ever!
","I just got back from seeing this and I'm awestruck! I heard in an interview with Bryan Singer, the director of this film, the original film that started it all, 2000's X-Men & the sequel X2: X-Men United, that in this film, he was trying to tie everything that had happened after the first two movies and fix the problems. In that I say he did a spot on job and bravo! If you are a fan of these films, I guarantee this will be your favorite of the franchise! It is so good! The action is wonderful, the story is intriguing to follow and the film looks great and sounds awesome. I'm one of those film fans that noticed that the first three films in the franchise, start out in the same way in that after the 20th Century Fox logo comes on and then fades to black, the 'X' in Fox stays a bit longer before eventually fading too. I was hoping since Singer was back with the franchise, that this little treat to the fans would return too, and it does! I was so pumped when I saw this, not to mention the use of Ottman's X2 theme towards the end of the 20th Century Fox logo as well. Oh and I loved, LOVED, Quicksilver's scene! Practically sole the show! :)"

It also appropriately utilizes good humor throughout the seemingly melancholy plot.<br/><br/>X-Men: Days of Future Past is an ambitious movie, it brings the newer cast from First Class as well as the older trilogy, plus Hugh Jackman. The time traveling gimmick could be a puzzling one, and in some occasions there are tricky twists that rely on heavy expositions. However, the movie pulls it off quite neatly with balanced pacing. The complexity doesn't divert the focus away from relationship of characters, most of which are always in peril. Many of the cast are capable to lead a movie by their own, but the movie doesn't feel bloated because they are so many involved. Director Bryan Singer cleverly seams the characters' tales together; the present chemistry produces engaging interaction between them.<br/><br/>The bulk of the story occurs in 1973, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence take most of the spotlight. They perform admirably, each showcasing emotional baggage and entwined history together. Hugh Jackman fits into the party fairly well, he has been Wolverine for so long, he just naturally meshes together with the younger X-Men. Peter Dinklage provides a unique antagonist. X-Men movies are notoriously filled with military men as villains, it's nice to see someone more dynamic and with less reliance to violence.<br/><br/>Effects are done beautifully. The future battles are spectacular, not to mention the choreography gracefully combines the mutants' power into the fray. I personally like the intricacy of Blink's ability which allows her to use multiple portals. Her scenes are few, but very well done. The slow motion effect looks wonderful and melee combat is performed effectively, especially Mystique's acrobatic dances. There's lingering retro ambiance for 70s, a simple touch of familiarity. One minor blemish is the lighting for future setting might be a tad too dark at times to fully appreciate the graphic.<br/><br/>The prevalent flaw of time travel gimmick is the impact actions supposedly have on the future, this movie is no exception. There are a few instances where characters act rather brashly just in case it may hopefully change the future, a couple decisions are questionable as well, it's hard to believe experienced mutants with special powers would do impulsive action. It also tries to add prejudice theme, but seeing Jennifer Lawrence, even with blue skin, having self-confident issue is like seeing a supermodel complaining she's fat. All the flaws are just little hindrance, they barely affect the gripping performance of the talents.<br/><br/>X-Men: Days of Future Past is arguably the best of the franchise, it will entertain viewers with exquisite acting, finely pace story and delightfully likable characters."
"moviexclusive","9","2","2","22 May 2014"," One of the best X-Men movies ever, and one of the best superhero movies you'll ever see – this union of two different teams of X-Men is funny, poignant and thrilling
","Slightly more than a decade after setting the gold standard of the Fox/ Marvel franchise he successfully launched, Bryan Singer is back at the helm of perhaps its most ambitious entry yet. Conceived by the previous instalment's screenwriter Simon Kinberg, it attempts to merge two separate timelines with two sprawling casts - the Patrick Stewart/Ian McKellen gang from the first 'X-Men' trilogy;, and the younger generation, led by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, from 2011's 'X- Men: First Class' – by introducing the tricky element of time travel. The result is in a word - extraordinary - combining the best from two different teams for an exhilarating adventure across time.<br/><br/>As Stewart solemnly intones at the beginning, a years-long war between the mutants and an army of near-indestructible robots known as Sentinels has devastated the world, resulting in a terrifying dystopian future where mutants and mutant-sympathizing humans have been rounded up in internment camps. Gathered with Professor X (Stewart) and Magneto (McKellen) against the Sentinel threat are familiars Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), as well as some new additions including Bishop (Omar Sy), Blink (Fan Bingbing), and Warpath (Booboo Stewart).<br/><br/>The one hope to their survival lies back in the past - or more precisely, the year 1973 - where Mystique's (Jennifer Lawrence) assassination of Sentinel creator Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) will not only cement the humans' suspicion of the mutants as a threat but also lead to her capture and the use of her shape-shifting DNA into the design of the robots. Logan/ Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) ability to heal makes him the only suitable candidate for travelling back in time - his mission to convince the younger Professor X (McAvoy) and Magneto (Fassbender) to put aside their differences in order to avert the killing that would change the course of history.<br/><br/>That's a fair bit of exposition to set up the events that follow, but Singer knows just how to keep the pacing nimble. Showing that he has lost none of his touch for inventive action sequences, Singer unfurls an opening that leverages largely on Blink's powers of teleportation to deliver some truly eye-popping action. Indeed, action is pretty much the language of the movie, which plays to the strengths and powers of the individual characters to move the plot forwards. Wisely though, he eschews the need to build gigantic setpieces in favour of more intimately scoped ones – and of these, the most singularly impressive is that of Quicksilver (Evan Peters), whose superhuman speed gets a stimulating demonstration in bullet-time while on a prison-bust within the Pentagon.<br/><br/>That sequence is also an excellent case-in-point of one of the X-factors of his original entries which Singer brings back to the franchise, levity. Most prominently, Quicksilver's brief entry in the franchise (chiefly due to rights issues) is played for maximum comic slapstick – but thankfully without ever tipping into caricature. Singer knows always how to stay on the right side of cool, and despite the catastrophic peril facing our characters, keeps the tone lively and effervescent. It isn't just Singer's credit of course; some of the most light-hearted moments of the film belong to Jackman, who oozes charisma and wryness as he is called to play mentor to the younger Professor X and his student Beast (Nicholas Hoult) in a clear reversal of roles. <br/><br/>And yet the one most important element which Singer retains is the humanity of these characters. The struggle between the humans and the mutants has always been at the heart of the best of these movies as well as the comics, meant of course as an allegory to the discriminated and marginalised within our very society by virtue of the fact of them being different from the majority. Here, that struggle becomes even more pronounced with Logan's warning of just what the future holds, exacerbating the ideological differences between Professor X and Magneto as well as their battle for the heart and mind of Mystique as a crucial piece in the chess game of fate.<br/><br/>Kinberg's plotting deserves special mention here, juggling multiple time streams and alternate futures effortlessly without ever breaking a sweat. He even manages to contain the inherent logical gaps in time travel, and in the grander scheme of the franchise, forges an exciting way forward for future instalments while respecting the events of the first three movies. Both Kinberg and Singer are also clearly invigorated recreating period here, as they redefine the assassination of JFK, recreate the voice and visage of Richard Nixon (played by Canadian thespian Mark Camacho) and recount these historically defining events with the grainy, bright-colored look of '70s newsreels to give them a touch of verite.<br/><br/>As always, the casting of the characters remains spot-on. Jackman has never been more compelling as Logan than he is here, exhibiting restraint and temerity that brings newfound gravitas and pathos to his character. McAvoy and Fassbender continue to make a fascinating pair, portraying their emotionally complex relationship with heartfelt poignancy especially when contrasted against their kinder, gentler older selves who wonder why they spent so many years bickering. Lawrence however doesn't quite make an impact as one may have hoped, but the actress remains a fetching presence whether in human form or in Mystique's blue birthday suit.<br/><br/>That's still a minor, very minor, quibble for a movie which gets so many things right. The action is first engaging, then thrilling, and finally at its climax exhilarating. The characters are well sketched out, their dilemmas real, relatable and therefore genuinely affecting. The story is complex without ever being complicated. For a summer blockbuster, it belongs in a rare breed that blends emotional resonance, humour, wit and grand spectacle into one immensely satisfying whole. Like we said, it is in a word, extraordinary."

","If you like X1 and X2, you might like this, but if you are a big fan of X-Men First Class, like I am - you should be warned that this is a different animal. I was quite disappointed in this one.<br/><br/>The point is: One of Matthew Vaughn's biggest strengths is pacing. Say what you will about him; his movies have a great flow. The same thing, however, seems to be a weakness with Singer. Compared to First Class, this movie was SOOO SLOW. It was badly paced, and it was also heavy-handed, repetitive and sentimental. Not emotional, I like emotional - it was sentimental. Singer is too fond of these characters, especially the old X-men (everything to bring them back!) plus the Charles-Raven-Erik conflict. God, that conflict got tiring! I loved Xavier as the brilliant, funny, warm teacher in First Class. Now he was suddenly ALL ABOUT Raven/Mystique. Ugh! Kill your darlings, Singer! You've lost your critical sense! <br/><br/>Quicksilver was one of the few good things about this movie, but he was gone too fast.<br/><br/>This movie had some good action scenes and glimpses of humour. And nostalgia, I guess, if you're a big X-men fan. First Class, however, had better pacing, script, score, was much more fun and also more poignant."
"Sjhm","4","8","14","13 June 2014"," NO. Just...no!
","Originally, I came home from the theatre and gave this a 6. I enjoyed it marginally more than the other blockbuster. But I have come to realise that 6 is unfair to the other movies I've given a 6 to, and the absolutely dreadful and badly cut together script for this film dials it down to a 4. Not even the dream team of Sir Patrick and Sir Ian with their mini-mes, McAvoy and Fassbender can drag this film up. Hugh Jackman is a great tough guy. He has made Wolverine his own, and usually that would be a good enough reason to watch, but not this one.<br/><br/>The good. The CGI is spectacular. <br/><br/>The bad. The plot. It leaps about from seventies to the future. Backwards and forwards, half the time the timeline of the story is so fudged you don't actually know what is happening. For instance, you clearly see Bobby (Iceman) die. Killed by the robots. But a little later he's alive and well. This is apparently caused by the few embattled X-Men leaping back in time so that they were ""never there"". <br/><br/>The hook is Logan going back to the 70s to prevent Mystique killing Trask. Because if she kills Trask (who designs the robots), after his death they take her DNA and are somehow able, because Trask's design exists to make his design really work just from a basic prototype. Trask really, really hates mutants. In fact his fellow mutant-hater Stryker comments on this. The reason for Trask's hatred and cruelty to those different to himself are completely unclear. We know why Stryker hates mutants. But Trask. No idea, and his answer to Stryker's question doesn't explain anything. It also seems a very strange hook to hang the story on. A scientist in the 70s develops a rabid hatred for mutants, and unilaterally creates a robot to destroy this one MAYBE threat. (Which wasn't any kind of threat until he started tinkering).<br/><br/>The CGI is spectacular. It is big, loud and utterly summer blockbuster. But without the humanity in the film, and the message that Xavier is more humane than most humans, we did actually get from the first movie thank you very much, without any real honest motivation for what Trask was doing, and the dizzying leaps back and forth in time this film is hard to follow or care about the fate of the characters. I have nothing against Jennifer Lawrence, she's a fine actress, but Rebecca Romijn's natural grace and calmness would have made for a more interesting protagonist. Jennifer simply isn't as graceful or as magnetic. (At least in this film). Mystique's reactions to the files she finds in Trask's office safe seem curiously out of character for the beautiful and deadly Mystique.<br/><br/>This is supposed to be a superhero movie. On this showing there was nothing that super, and certainly not that heroic about the film. Jossing every single thing that went before also seems to be an error of judgement. Watching it, I was basically praying for it to end. Not the way I want to feel about an X-Men film. Thoroughly disappointed."
"dee.reid","9","7","12","3 June 2014"," ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014)
","Perhaps the best thing that can be said about the 2014, Bryan Singer-directed ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is that it is a near-perfect melding of past and present, much like its source material. Personally, I've long considered the best ""X-Men"" movies to have always been under Singer's direction (i.e., 2003's ""X2"" - the best ""X-Men"" film there ever was). As an openly gay Jew who was raised in a mostly Christian community growing up, Singer knew what it was like to be an outsider, which is why, it can be said, that the best ""X-Men"" movies belong to him and do contain a slight personal touch.<br/><br/>I've admired the X-Men pretty much since the time I first got into comics and superheroes. They are my favorite superhero team, without question. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby first launched the title for Marvel Comics in 1963 as a way of voicing their feelings about racism in American society, and over the years other artists and writers have used the title as a platform to voice similar concerns about racial hatred, homophobia, anti-Semitism, religion and religious fundamentalism, and any & all other forms of hatred and intolerance.<br/><br/>""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is adapted from the famous two-part comic book story arc of the same name (""The Uncanny X-Men #141-142"" - both of which I do own) by long-time ""X-Men"" writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne. Like the original story arc that inspired it, the film features old and new, meaning old characters (from Singer's first ""X-Men"" film series) and new ones (the new series that began with 2011's ""X-Men: First Class""). The story is greatly different from the comics, but the basic premise is still the same: in a dystopian future where mutants are hunted down and either killed out-right or imprisoned in internment camps, Professor Charles Xavier/Professor X (Patrick Stewart) uses his powers to send someone - Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat in the original comics, Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) here - back in time and avert the disaster that will turn humankind against the world's mutant population and lead to an eventual mutant holocaust.<br/><br/>I'm going to stop there. The movie is quite thrilling and occasionally very frightening. The best thing that can be said about the picture is the fact that Bryan Singer is back on-board the film series he helped to create and bears his signature. The movie is a spectacle and can be pretty funny in some spots, i.e., the early scenes set in 1973 with the teenage mutant speedster Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver (""American Horror Story's"" Evan Peters), and the younger, disenchanted Professor X (James McAvoy). And the way that it re-writes history to suit its vision is very creative (the JFK assassination, anyone?); special credit should be given to screenwriter Simon Kinberg in that regard. Oh yeah, and the fearsome Sentinels finally make their screen debut after all these years.<br/><br/>So far, this is the second-best ""X-Men"" movie I've seen. The return of Bryan Singer was very welcomed by this long-time X-Men fan. If the film's ending is any indication, I can't wait for this film's follow-up in a few years (""Age of Apocalypse"" is what I've heard).<br/><br/>9/10"

","X-Men: Days of Future Past review, from the sound of a nerd. Hello everybody and welcome to Sound of The Nerds' first review, this one is coming from Toby. <br/><br/>Visual Presentation: The movie has a ""right"" feel of the 70's era. Using heavily CGI, which looks great, the movie emphasizes large monsters, and beautiful powers. The coloring really shows the difference between a dark desolate future, and the bright and hopeful 70's. <br/><br/>""Am I the only one who's dying to see the costumes (-Hank McCoy)? The 70's era has no ""X-Men costumes"" as the X-Men at the time don't exist. Whatsoever, seeing Magneto in something very much resembling his classic was fantastic. Jennifer Lawrence ditched a costume to don a body suit, and looks amazing as mystique. McAvoy looks nothing like the Charles I know, but created a unique twist to him, that adds character. The biggest surprise was Quicksilver, whom in the trailers looked ridicules, but in the actual movie, it was quite good, the costume really added to his character. Beast has become more feral, more alike his true self.<br/><br/>In the Future everything looks darker. The old cast hasn't really changed that much, and their costumes remain true to what they have been, but the little things do improve. The biggest difference is Shadowcat moving from a normal teenage mutant in The Last Stand to becoming a war torn soldier in Days. The new guys was visually impressive, especially Blink and Bishop, they very much look like a realistic version of themselves from the comic books. The fighting scenes were very good, especially in the future.<br/><br/>The first time, watching cerebro in 3D? For me that was the singular greatest moment in the movie! It was really amazing, and felt like a way of getting closer to understanding Charles. <br/><br/>Sound: There isn't much to say about the sound of the movie. The soundtrack was unnoticeable, some will say this is a good attribute to the movie, others will say that it is the exact opposite, I like the fact that it was unnoticeable. Whatsoever, the one part that stuck in my head was Wolverine listening to ""First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" fitting both the time, and the character from the comics. Other than this, at sometimes I recognized some similarities in the score between Days and previous movies. Story: I will keep this very clear of spoilers, and do note that as a fan this is the most important part of the movie to me. The story really does what Singer wanted to do, and is used very much as an eraser. It tries to maintain true to the story from the comics, using Shadowcat as a means to time travel, as she was the one who traveled back in time in the comics. Whatsoever, this left me with one question, how does ""phasing"" as in moving thru place turn into the power to move others thru time? If it was made clear this was in accordion with Xavier's telepathy (it was telepathy in the books) it would be easier to swallow. Other questions do surface, how is Xavier alive? Why does Magneto have his powers back? Why does Wolverine have adamantium claws again? I can't answer these questions, but I do hope they will be answered in bonus scenes from the DVD.<br/><br/>The movie really ties up everything the X-Men is, a constant struggle for survival, and putting your life on risk for those who hate you. The addition of the new characters like Bishop, Blink and Quicksilver was well done; they all got appropriate screen time according to their back story and importance to their story, and most importantly expanding on the entire universe. The main story circles around Wolverine, Magneto and Xavier, with other important parts by Beast and Mystique. Whatsoever I missed Banshee, Emma Frost, Rogue, so I really wanted more of the old cast back, especially in the past, with only four recurring characters.<br/><br/>Following the other movies, it feels mostly like a sequel to First Class, for me personally this was a huge setback, I was expecting to see the original cast more than they actually was featured, because of the way the movie has been advertised, I expected more of them, and many explanations that never arrived. Overlooking that, the movie did make the shifts between future and past smooth. The second time I saw it, knowing how little the future was going to be featured, I understood why the shifts were made when they was made. <br/><br/>Cast: Having some of the best actors of past and present, it contains some of the best talent. Patrick Stewart is the same Charles we all know, and hearing him was a wonder. Whilst the two Xavier are vastly different, Fassbender is very much only a younger McKellen. And one of the scenes Fassbender has, on-board a plane, he shows so much power, and only in words, portraying the same Magneto I know and love, and proving him to be the strongest surprise. The new additions also did a good job, the most noticeable of them was Evan Peters as Quicksilver. The cast was as wonderful as ever. Seeing McKellen and Stewart again was amazing, although short lived. <br/><br/>Overall: A wonderful summer movie,great action adding to a great story This movie finally ties together all the previous movies. The second best X-Men movie ever made, this is a must see, although the others should be seen firstly. Setting up the future of the franchise, this is the movie you must see this summer! <br/><br/>+ Fassbender and McAvoy's chemistry + The notes to the comics + Charles high and drunk! - Too little concentration on the future part - Leaves you with more questions, then it answered"

","Following CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER, Marvel continues with the Political Thriller template, and in X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, none other than Richard Nixon is in cahoots with a greedy entrepreneur who plans to exterminate mutants by using robotic war machines That's President Richard Milhouse Nixon, the current Commander-in-Chief as it's 1973 since Wolverine was sent back to the past so that Mystique, also known as Raven, doesn't get captured by authorities which would result in well let's just say there's no more X-MEN if he doesn't set things straight...<br/><br/>And of course Logan's not alone, providing the last entry, FIRST CLASS, to coincide with the original lineup – although FUTURE PAST is more of that movie's sequel with Hugh Jackman serving as special guest star. Meanwhile the likes of veteran members Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and Halley Berry are wasted on a subplot dealing with some kind of purgatory dimension resembling the THOR universe.<br/><br/>The best scenes are also the funniest, mostly having to do with Wolverine's '70s culture shock and slacker mutant Peter aka Quicksilver and his penchant for not only speeding past everyone else, but perceiving them in the same wry, sarcastic manner Wolverine did in the original film, also directed by Bryan Singer which, to give due credit, started the Marvel monopoly in the first place. And those were indeed the great old days...<br/><br/>For now, in the midst of an otherwise promising time travel espionage, one excruciatingly overlong sequence involving Xavier in his virtual reality brain-machine, trying to coax Raven from assassinating a mutant-hating businessman (the only real villain on board), deletes potential as the characters waste so much verbal energy explaining and/or pontificating past and future events, nothing very suspenseful occurs in the meantime."

"almanjit25","7","10","19","24 May 2014"," Disappointing and a missed opportunity but still passable.
","To begin, i loved X-Men: First Class and had high hopes for this one. I'll get it out there, i did not like Days of Future Past. I expected it to be mind-blowing, gritty and emotionally provocative after watching the trailers and reading about it on the web. I expected a collision of worlds, darkness and epic beauty. Instead i got a mediocre film. A great premise ruined by a lazy script and underdeveloped characters. In addition there was a lack of thrills, excitement and twists. The story felt pedestrian, a-been-there-and-seen-that situation if you will. And it was tied together way too neatly, too perfectly. The script doesn't get the most out of its characters and makes them feel bland. I mean the villain has poor motivations and is absolutely unnecessary. Peter Dinklage, who i think is awesome, is wasted in this movie. The Wolverine, who normally i love, is a place setting in this film. He is there but he doesn't do much though is seen throughout. It felt repetitive, too similar in content to everything we've come to expect from the X-Men. Nothing New. I was bored through a huge chunk of it.<br/><br/>As i said, the script gets too lazy trying to tie everything together in a perfect package and way too quickly with missed opportunities all through. At times it feels too sappy and cliché and at others where powerful dramatic moments are necessary they are not provided or feel rushed. Here was an opportunity to show a divided nation, propaganda, poisoning of minds from those who hate the mutants and a descending darkness, war and a world at a boiling point in addition to an emotional story, cataclysmic and yet filled with the hope, equality and good i.e everything the X-Men stand for. It was a missed opportunity. I was let down but the film still had its moments. The post credits scene was intriguing and despite this film not reaching my expectations, i cannot wait for X-Men Apocalypse."

","X-Men Days of Future Past showed just little enough in the trailers to not let you know that the entire movie was going to be butchered, but just enough to make it seem incredible. The entire movie was made simply to rectify the Giant Sh*t that Brett Ratner on X-Men The Last Stand. Of course the could have used about 1/3 of the movie to fix what Ratner did by killing off all the good/main characters. But instead the whole movie was used to follow a story line that doesn't make any logical sense. Movies that depend on moving to the past to change the future are improbably to direct properly, because no matter what the conflict is, there is an easier way to go about it, i.e. go back a little further then planned and stop the beginning conflict from taking affect (hard to go into detail without spoiling.) All in all 20th Century & Marvel did a fantastic job of stealing your money, putting Jennifer Lawrence on a pedestal (Mystique is supposed to stay blue most of the time, that's the point) and showing that Hugh Jackman can be an old man & ripped."

"george59883-36-312142","9","6","10","24 June 2014"," My Favorite X-Men Film
","This is a well told story. The time travel is so complicated, but it is easy to follow. Xavier is truly the focal point. The Wolverine is only there to get a ball rolling and create this change. Erik and Xavier are still having the same argument they are making in every other film and Mystique still doesn't know who to side with. She can't decide what she wants to be. She has to choose her own path. Mystique is brilliantly acted in this film by Jennifer Lawrence. I loved her portrayal in First Class and anyone should be glad about this performance because she turns into Rebecca Romijn. James McAvoy falls away in this role and equally brilliant in his role is Michael Fassbender. Each of these men give the characters a dynamic that is so much better in this film. The weaknesses of some of the first films is the fact that the didn't get a lot of screen time together, but in this film they get to play out their struggles to each other and fight over their beliefs. Mystique is in the middle and she has to fight the both of them. Magneto is the villain of the past in this film and it is so great to see that he still the same Magneto that we love. A man who is hurt from his experiences. Nicholas Hoult is also really cool as Beast and his change is also explained. Hoult is there as a support for Xavier and it takes a talent to be able to handle your own against Hugh Jackman. Hugh Jackman is Huge Jacked Man. He is the most fit person I have ever seen in my life and is brilliant in his role as Wolverine. Hugh takes this to a new level and his also added dimension. Trask is a villain that you get what he is doing and has a clear motivation that I really enjoyed. Peter Dinklage's height is pleasantly absent from the script and is satisfying for this character and actor. You don't like Trask, but you can see where he is coming from. Peter is even one of the best parts of the film. His comedy and action blows you out of the water. The hint at the his relations to Magneto and it isn't very overbearing about it. His action scene is also so good that it is on the level of Nightcrawler's raid on The White House.<br/><br/>I also have to give a hand to Bryan Singer. I believe that it is hard to come back to a franchise a couple films removed and he did an excellent job. He was able to go from future to past so seamlessly that it is really cool and the action is so well directed. You also have to give a hand to Simon Kinberg and Mathew Vaughn as well because they also had to write this story that seamlessly goes between times and each time brings its own feeling and that comes from the writing itself. Kinberg does a great job of bringing in the funny comedic moments without it going into silliness. The special effects are really great and are well done. The sentinels in the past looked like a newly made creation with the limitations of the time and the future sentinels are well explained why they look like that and are quite frightening. The time travel is so well done that you give credit to the people behind the camera who have to set it up well.<br/><br/>The future in itself is its own film. Each of the introduced mutants don't just seem like characters that need to be there so they can die or CGI tricks. They each get a moment to bring some kind of emotion to the screen. Professor X an Magneto in the future are so well done that they are friends and you get to see them together and you just enjoy yourself by seeing it. The future sentinels, like I said, are scary. They are frightening. When every future scene comes on my heart is pounding because of how well the suspense is built. The history of this film is so interesting that you can see where the future might be going, but you don't know how its going to get there.<br/><br/>I am flabbergasted about how well this film balances the time travel aspects and while being a pretty dark film and also balances the comedy as well. The time travel might over complicate the already confusing canon of the X-Men universe, but I only question it because of how good this film does on so many other levels of fixing the canon. Singer returns with a competent direction with the help of Kinberg's well written script. The action and effects is spectacular. Each actor gives a great performance that helps blend the two times together even more fluently. I am fan of superhero films that are simultaneously another genre at the same time. This is a great time travel film and a great superhero film. This is a great film and deserves a 3.75 out 4 stars."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","9","6","10","18 June 2014"," X-Men: Days of Future Past is a Fantastic Superhero Movie!
","I couldn't have said it better myself, or anyone else. This X-Men instalment is THE X-Men film that the fans have been anticipating since the beginning. I can even go ahead and say that this is the one that will even convert non-fans into fans, it's that good.<br/><br/>Days of Future Past reinvents what the series can do in such a fresh way, without rebooting it completely may I remind you. Most of all it is a time travel film, and there are some issues with the continuity but all can be forgiven after sitting through this film completely. It mends all the mistakes of the past X-Men films (in terms of quality) and feels closer to the comics than the first three movies.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I keep comparing too many superhero movies to The Dark Knight in terms of the story and the characterisation, but I only compare Days of Future Past to it in the ""reinventing the franchise"" way and also telling a bigger story that is darker and meaner. It gets so much right: The Sentinels, Wolverine, and the mixing of the all-star cast of X-Men 1-3 (including Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen) and even the cast from X-Men: First Class (featuring James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender).<br/><br/>The story, the direction, the editing, the music and particularly Quicksilver's soon-to-be classic scene, all adds up to one thrilling ride that doesn't deserve to be missed by any X-Men fan out there. I couldn't recommend this movie enough. It's like Avengers but with a whole world of weird and wonderful mutants.<br/><br/>A well deserved 9/10 is what this movie gets."
"sakeebshahid","9","6","10","14 June 2014"," Finally the X-men film the franchise needed
","The plot is as complicated as the title itself, but it's done so masterfully that there's no scope for complaints.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, and the chemistry between the cast members is noteworthy. It grips you instantly from the get-go with an elaborately orchestrated action sequence, and keeps you on the hook till the very end.<br/><br/>Even when there's not much going on-screen, the emotional intensity feels very real and palatable. <br/><br/>The introduction of Quicksilver couldn't be any better. He steals every scene that he's in, and makes vital contributions whenever he's needed. Hugh Jackman once again kills it as Wolverine. Only this time he shows his depth of the character in a more vulnerable and experienced way.<br/><br/>There is a couple of surprises throughout the film, and the inclusion of humor every now and then- makes the movie worth every penny!<br/><br/>The conflict of ideologies between the Professor and Magneto is impartially depicted. And the dark past of a few major characters is carefully handled.<br/><br/>Overall, a solid A+. And a must-see film of 2014."

","The sequel/prequel element makes for a complex storyline and there are some 'borrowed' themes from the TERMINATOR and ROBOCOP franchises, but this doesn't interfere with the viewer's enjoyment of DAYS OF FUTURE PAST. The pace is terrific and the action scenes showcase CGI at its very best. I watched the 2D version, having come to feel that 3D doesn't actually add much to a good movie (or a bad one).<br/><br/>Obviously you don't come to a film like this looking for great acting, but all the cast play their roles seriously without any pantomime send- ups. Middle age must be about to catch up with Hugh Jackman, but he's still a hunk. We mostly see the younger versions of Erik and Charles (Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy), but Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen pop up from time to time to add a bit of gravitas. Mark Camacho does a great job of recreating Richard M. Nixon, that most devious of presidents. There's a welcome surprise appearance at the end, and the suggestion that messing with time really does have consequences.<br/><br/>DAYS OF FUTURE PAST really raises the bar on sequels and remakes. It may be the best X-MEN yet. It's certainly the best, so far, of this summer's blockbusters."

","If you plan on watching a X-Men movie you expect some cool and latest-technology special effects, some great combat scenes in which mutants with crazy powers use whatever ability they're feeling like and of course some cold-blooded drama that sometimes is based on some real issues society faces (more often the movies ask ""How society treats minorities""). X-Men ""Days of Future Past"" has it all .... and so much more! Almost every line spoken is excellent and deeply important and the team of actresses and actors is absolutely stunning. I can't remember the last time I've seen a movie in which every actor/actress does their absolute best to achieve entertainment on such heights. If I'd want to find a fault in this movie it'd just be how the ending is so big of a plot-twist (which can be foreseen right from the start) that it greatly influences every single X-Men movie you have seen so far. If you like X-Men, you'll love ""Days of Future Past""."
"bkrauser-81-311064","9","6","10","25 May 2014"," The Best Mulligan Ever Made
","Many things occurred in the year 2000 that changed the way we look at the world. Known as the International Year for the Culture of Peace, the beginning of the millennium saw the first year of Vladimir Putin's reign, the tumultuous election of George W. Bush Jr. and an understated blockbuster by the name of X-Men made its debut. Watching it today, the film can be underwhelming, especially in comparison to its above-the-cut sequel, yet it still holds a special place both in my heart and the emergence and popularity of superhero films.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to the year 2014 and the X-Men has become an immensely popular film franchise with a spotty history as far as quality. Taken as a whole, the canon set by Director/Producer Bryan Singer and 20th Century Fox is a prime example of what a comic-book expanded universe can be. Still there were problems including the death of not one, not two but three important characters and the incredibly shoddy treatment of a fan favorite from the Marvel Expanded Universe.<br/><br/>Is it safe to say that X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) is the greatest mulligan ever made? After all, it's a sequel, its part of an extended canon and universe and with its play on time-travel it's also a reboot. It's also marvelous to boot featuring soundly made special effects, seamless period detail (a large swath of the movie takes place in 1973) and a great plot paying proper lip-service to many of the most popular characters from the comic-books. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Professor X (Patrick Stewart/James McAvoy), Magneto (Ian McKellen/Michael Fassbender), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Storm (Halle Berry), Beast (Kelsey Grammar/Nicholas Hoult), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), all have their moments to shine.<br/><br/>Director Bryan Singer and scribes Simon Kinberg, Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman wisely weave a story that is properly weighty with big stakes and big pay-offs all while being a character centered tale. There is a reverence and respect for the characters as well as a respect of an audience that has been burned by the X-Men movies of the last decade. The Avengers (2012) may have mastered the ensemble superhuman savior shtick but The X-Men are now juggling with fire batons (as well as ice batons, telepathic batons etc.). With the power of a salient, timely and timeless message of inclusion and tolerance this new installment may be the new standard in superhero franchise films. It's certainly the blockbuster to beat in 2014.<br/><br/>I have always has an affinity for the X-Men films, comic-books, cartoon series and memorabilia. Unlike many things you love starting at the age of ten, the characters have grown and evolved with me while keeping true to a core message that I still believe and probably will never grow out of. We still do not live in a culture of peace, yet through the stories we tell, maybe we can discover a world where special abilities can mirror our presumed faults and turn them into positivesand of course if the stories become bad we can always tinker a bit.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
"theflixerdotcom","8","5","8","7 September 2014"," An ambitious and appreciated effort!
","To me, this is the comic book property that has the best chance of competing with the Disney/Marvel universe. This movie was much more adult focused and serious than most of the movies coming out of Disney's Marvel machine. I love the Disney movies, but this was almost like a breath of fresh air. It had it's flaws, but they have the source material, the resources, and a very solid cast available to move this franchise in the right direction.<br/><br/>The plot of this was apparently taken from a comic book storyline which I have never read. They definitely selected the right material as I thought it was a great and well thought out story. It was also a great way to bring in the original cast. I only wish we could have seen more of them; for various reasons some of them such as Anna Paquin only had very limited screen time which I thought took away from the story a little. Especially because they were such a huge part of the original franchise. It seemed to me that the reason they weren't in the movie much didn't necessarily have anything to do with the story, and more to do with contracts. Even though I know they may not be in the comic much either I have read that at least Rogue should have had a larger part in the movie than she did.<br/><br/>That said, the only other gripe I had was the focus on Wolverine. We have stand-alone Wolverine movies available if you love Wolverine, so it would have been nice to center the plot around another character, or characters, this time around. There are plenty to choose from and the first movie did fine without him.<br/><br/>These complaints are mostly marginal; and not really a reflection of the movie itself. I loved the storyline and thought they did a truly great job of creating the Sentinels. You actually believe they could pose a major threat to even the most powerful of mutants. The action and effects were top notch and there were some truly great parts such as the Quicksilver sequence that I thought was very well done.<br/><br/>The scale of the movie was also fantastic, you truly feel as if you can grasp the power these mutants posses with the ability they have to control their environment; even on a large scale.<br/><br/>The biggest strength these movies have to me is the all star cast. With names like McAvoy, Lawrence, Fassbender, Hoult, and the fresh face of Even Peters leading this franchise into the future, there is a ton of potential to directly compete with any other comic book movie. Each of these actors is in the prime of their career at this point and they are all being assembled for these movies. They all bring a dramatic depth and believable emotion to their characters on what I believe is a higher level than any of the Avenger cast. As I mentioned earlier, these movies are more dramatic and therefore require more dramatic actors. That being said, this is the perfect cast for a more grown up and serious plot.<br/><br/>On a side note, I hear a lot of talk about Scarlet Johansson getting the first female lead super hero movie; but I believe Jennifer Lawrence is a superior actor and Mystique is a much more interesting character and should be given a movie as well. Who wouldn't love to see that? Overall, this was a great film BUT the focus on Wolverine was a bit of a cop out. I also think the ensemble cast was a little too ambitious as it didn't give every major character from both franchises enough screen time. Outside of the that, the plot, acting, and effects were top notch and I can't wait to see the next entry in this fantastic franchise! Rating: 7.5/10"
"blackmagic1092","8","5","8","4 September 2014"," Welcome back X-men ! its been awhile
","As once a jaded and disappointed fan of the recent film of x-men 3 and the first stand alone wolverine film. It left a bad taste in my mouth to a point that it took me a long while to watch x-men first class. So walking into this film i had no expectations with nerves on edge. Thankfully i strolled out of that theater with a smile & stomach filled. I was pleased with just about every aspect of the film! Now lets get down to this, yes its a time travel film. As a seasoned veteran of sci-fiction films and TV i can overlook logic and not let it bother me as long as the story is using the tool of time travel well. The characters and circumstances are what is going to sell this plot point. So if time travel drives you crazy then good luck. There wasn't any major issues i could find while using the time travel tool or anything really to knit pick. So the story goes, in the future sentinels which are human military grade machines standing a few stories high made to hunt, capture and kill mutants. While unfortunately, they appeared to have taken over everything on earth & have became an unstoppable force that not even the most powerful mutants can stop. The kicker for the sentinels is that they adapt to every mutant ability within seconds or minutes, hence damn near invincible. How did they manage to develop this ability? well it all goes back to the 1980s( or close to it) if I'm correct where mystique is captured by government authorities after an assassination of a top defense official. In a nut shell they reverse engineer her genes in a sense and weaponize them into the sentinels. Here is the main plot point of the story in which they send wolverine back in time to this period in history to prevent the assassination of the official and stop mystique from carrying out her plan and being captured.<br/><br/>Throughout the film the story moves in and out of the past to the present. Wolverine really carries this film while quicksilver is the comedy relieve in terms of his super speed ability which had some truly amazing scenes! The conflict between professor xavier and magneto is high and their conflicting points of view stay steady throughout the story. Magneto is not driven by anything but his believe in the inevitable war between humans and mutants. Beast is living with xavier at the time and is helping him with his disability as a result of magnetos antics in the previous film. While wolverine is recruiting magneto, xavier and quicksilver in the past. It soon turns into a hunt for mystique. Despite magnetos questionable alliance to the group and ultimately hoping to turn the very first sentinel prototypes against the humans. The race to stop both mystique and magneto ensues but every ones fate still rests in the hands of mystique.<br/><br/>In the future xavier and magneto are held up in a secret location hiding from the sentinels in the mountians. There is a time table of course and its only a matter of time before the sentinels find them and attack with every weapon in their arsenal. My only problem with this part of the movie is that with so many mutants in the film not many had enough time for character development. There was two unfamiliar mutants named sunspot and blink that were in the film that i didn't have any idea who they were and unfortunately when their deaths arrived it was a little trivial. But their teleportation powers were pretty cool. They were truly obscure characters in the x men universe unless of course your an x men comic junkie. Bishop, iceman, colossus, storm , and kitty pryde were the main mutants. In the final battle storms and magnetos powers were under utilized for the most part. I was expecting them to bring some serious destruction to the attacking sentinels and becoming the last standing mutants but it was short lived and storms death was quick and anti climatic. These were some minor issues i had, but was still entertaining.<br/><br/>Lastly this film was a huge step up from the previous films ! the writing was spot on and just about every character in the film was entertaining. There was a few plot holes here and there but none worth mentioning in my opinion! Definitely would consider owning this bad boy. Hopefully the writing stays strong and the characters continue to be true extensions from the source material."

","At first, the idea to unite the old and new face of X-Men team is brilliant but could be risky too. Thankfully Bryan Singer knows what he's doing and seems comfortable with the material it has, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" never get confused or lost with bunch of mutant character and always focus to the main topic. All top form casts are placed where it should be and given almost same portion on each significant character while the plot itself is nicely structured and the future-past time are neatly set. The mixed of action-drama-comedy are put in a right place and never reduce fun factor this movie offers. A hilarious escape scene, thoughtful yet compelling time twisted storyline guided with charismatic performance by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, all ended with stunning action climax, it's a first class entertainment which the fans and non fans of X-men franchise are expecting. Overall ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is an elegant, emotional, entertaining action-packed that is worth to see at any season. And once again Bryan Singer proves himself as an X-Men specialty. He succeeded to bring nostalgia from the original X-Men casts and give more chances for younger member to shine by continuing the respected-solid foundation that Matthew Vaughn had created. It is the X-Men series that audiences have missed since ""X2"" and got potential to be the most remarkable superhero movie this year."

","If Kitty has to send someone (Wolverine) back in time, why not go back even further and stop Trask from experimenting on other Mutants? Add to it, Magneto is aware of the mess the mutants would be in, if they kill humans. Magneto has a change of heart towards the humans and tried killing Mystique, to save the mutants in the future. But he flips and goes back to destroying the White House, nullifying the attempt to not appear a villain in the eyes of the humans. Wolverine never ages. So what's with those white streaks? Too many issues that were left hanging. The whole going back in time kinda messed up the whole time line for the X-Men franchise."

"g-bodyl","10","3","4","11 April 2015"," Best X-Men Yet!
","X-Men: Days of Future Past is the X-Men movie that we have all been waiting for. The last movie that could give this film a run for its money was 2003's X2. 2011's First Class was a step in the right direction, but this film is very masterful and engaging. I loved the idea of combining old cast with new cast and the results are impressive. The story is written well and there are several emotional moments. The action is also very good and some of the set pieces are just grand. The visuals compliment the action and they come out in full-force during the scenes of Quicksilver. <br/><br/>Bryan Singer returns to the helm to direct this film. The main theme is changing history so that the future will be different from which the past set it out to be. Wolverine is sent back to the 1970's to stop a program in which mutants are being targeted by these sentinels which are created to take out and destroy mutants. <br/><br/>This movie has one of the greatest ensembles in recent film history. The old cast is here, the new cast is here, and they combine forces to put on a show. Hugh Jackman is ever awesome as Wolverine. Patrick Stewart/James McAvoy and Ian McKellan/Michael Fassbender are all great in their respective roles as Professor X and Magneto. Jennifer Lawrence has some great scenes as Mystique. Peter Dinklage made a great addition to the cast as the main villain and someone to keep an eye on is Evan Peters as Quicksilver.<br/><br/>Overall, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the X-Men sequel we have all been waiting for. By combining old and new, we have ourselves one of the greatest comic books film ever made. Not only is there impressive action, the storyline comprises of raw human emotion and characterization. By far, this is the greatest X-Men movie made to date and I am eager to see how this universe is expanded in the future. <br/><br/>My Grade: A+"

"diac228","7","3","4","4 July 2014"," Suffering from superior competition, Days of Future Past entertains, but doesn't push franchise forward like X2
","X-Men Days of Future Past should go down as the blockbuster film that had arguably the most daunting task you'll see from a Summer flick: successfully combining a rebooted franchise with the franchise it had just replaced. Luckily for all of us there's a good old-fashioned time travel story to connect the two without too many continuity disruptions. Bringing back the man that delivered the best of the X-Men films up to this point, 20th Century Fox went all out to ensure that they can still hang on to the Marvel franchise.<br/><br/>Based off of the highly-successful comic book series, Days of Future Past revolves around Wolverine (And not Kitty) heading back to the past to prevent a murder from occurring and creating the fallout that would lead to the dystopian-like present that involves all the mutants hiding for their lives. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, the only constant that connects the two series of X-Men films, is the only hope to unite Professor X and Magneto in the 70s to prevent the creation of the ultra-powerful Sentinels. The emotional fallout from the events of First Class is overwhelmingly present so this movie feels a lot like a sequel and less as a mere connecting bridge between the X-Men films. Newcomers to the X-Men brand would probably be lost.<br/><br/>The time-traveling quirks and limitations that made Back to the Future a masterpiece are not present here; the focus is entirely on the characters and the task they have at hand. X-Men fans shouldn't be too upset because they get to see a heavy slew of the mutants including Quicksilver, Colossus, Storm, among others. Too bad most of the X-Men are condensed to cameo-like appearances.<br/><br/>And yea.....still no Gambit.....<br/><br/>Whatever the film lacks in humor and action, it makes up for it with the heavy set of drama, bouts with forgiveness vs. justice, and the genuine care you will have towards our heroes. But like I said, the action is rather lacking and after nearly 15 years of X-Men being on the screen the battling becomes well repetitive. Which is a shame because Bryan Singer can craft good action sequences, especially when Quicksilver was involved. The Quicksilver appearance further proves the dulling of the fighting in X-Men when we see Magneto once again picking up something heavy with his mind and see Wolverine once again slash his way through opponents. After seeing the creative battles occurring on the Disney side, it gets hard to be blown away by anything here.<br/><br/>There is plenty of heart and good performances, but you can't help but feel slightly underwhelmed at the X-Men as this is the seventh film featuring at least one of the mutants since 2000. Back then the X-Men was the peak of joyful comic book mayhem as we saw lots of interesting characters work together and showcase their abilities. But after the likes of The Incredibles, The Dark Knight, The Avengers, and even the recent Captain America, the competition has caught up. It is time to expand the scope, and push the franchise farther ahead with more risks, more surprises, and more twists.<br/><br/>X-Men Days of Future Past will be sure to delight modern-day X-Men fans while slightly upsetting the hardcore crowd, but it doesn't quite top the quality batch of comic book movies we have seen within the past 5 years. Here's to hoping Apocalypse can shake things up a bit now that the transition between X-Men series is complete."
"toqtaqiya2","8","3","4","27 June 2014"," This deftly scripted and unusually affecting film is truly memorable.
","X-Men: Days Of Future Past marks the end of an era. The cast that people got used to over the last 15 years makes its final appearance. It's a bit sad to see actors like Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Ian McKellen (Magneto) go because they were so charismatic in their roles. In this film too they show their excellent acting abilities. It's actually nice to see familiar faces return. Halle Berry (Storm), Shawn Ashmore (Iceman) and Daniel Cudmore (Colossus) took part in the action, while others returned to nicely conclude everything at the end. Days Of Future Past is a sequel to both The Last Stand (2006) and First Class (2011). The satisfying ending isn't the only thing that director Bryan Singer was thorough with. This sequel has been called the best X-Men film yet by some reviewers. My opinion is that First Class is the best X-Men film so far, but Days Of Future Past is just about as good. But let's not forget about X2 (2003), which is another worthy contender for the best X-Men film. I'm not someone who likes the X-Men films much. I think that none of them have been perfect so far. They all have something that prevents them from being great films or some of the best superhero films. They're first and foremost blockbusters that are meant to entertain. Some scenes in Days Of Future Past can be seen again and again, especially the spectacular opening sequence that introduces a nightmarish new threat. In terms of action Singer is at the top of his game here. The tone is softened after the incredibly grim introduction. Some may think this wise, but once Wolverine is in the past the film loses momentum, introduces characters that aren't very interesting, humor that isn't very funny, action that isn't very exciting, and details that aren't very clever. Some people may think that Magneto's connection to the JFK assassination was clever but, in my opinion, it was handled poorly by Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg. The film slows down noticeably in the middle. This minor problem is what prevents me from giving Days Of Future Past a very good rating. What happens at the end though is just as interesting and entertaining as what happens at the beginning. The action is terrific and John Ottman's good score is used to great effect. Days Of Future Past is a long film, with 131 minutes of running time. Still, considering its epic time-traveling story and its many characters I can say that Singer and Kinberg succeeded in making the film satisfying. Much of the cast can be applauded for their efforts. Stewart and McKellen, as I mentioned before, are excellent as usual in their roles. Hugh Jackman is as reliable as always as Wolverine. Many people forget that Jackman is a good actor. He proved it in films like The Fountain (2006) and Prisoners (2013) and even in schlock like Kate & Leopold (2001) and Van Helsing (2004). Jennifer Lawrence, playing Mystique, is fine in her role but nothing special in my opinion. When she's covered with blue paint she's not as menacing or as sexy as Rebecca Romijn was in the role. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy get to impress only at the end of the film. Before that there's really nothing to write about concerning their acting. They're clearly not as charismatic as they were in First Class. In fact, McAvoy simply annoyed me while he was doing his depressed Charles Xavier bit. His acting, thankfully, improved when Xavier tried to convince Mystique to abandon the course that she was on. The only other thing that I have to add about Days Of Future Past is that it doesn't contain as much establishment propaganda as First Class. In First Class it was just obvious. ""Mutant and proud"" was clearly a metaphor for ""gay and proud."" In case you didn't know, I'll mention that for the Anglo-American establishment pro-gay propaganda is very important. It's one of their tactics to reduce human population on the planet because they think that there's way too many people now. So being fine with homosexuality and not having children is what the ruling class wants for the lower classes. Globalization is another thing that's very important for the establishment. The story takes place in different countries and there's also an international cast involved. In Days Of Future Past, the Russians and the Chinese are mentioned as enemies that are more dangerous than the mutants. This also fits into the establishment line. Russia and China are the main enemies for the ruling class of Britain and the USA. North Korea gets most of the hate these days, but China and especially Russia aren't far behind. Other than what I've mentioned there's really nothing to complain about. The visual effects, especially the Sentinels, are mostly impressive and so are the designs. Days Of Future Past suffers because of the plethora of characters. Not all of the key players are given satisfying story arcs, but I still recommend this epic yet entertaining film."

Not only is the movie the best in the X-Men saga, but it is also funny, suspenseful, gripping, and action-packed. I absolutely love the storyline in this film as well. <br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes of this movie was Quicksilver's. Is there anyone who does not like the guy?! Because he is amazing! I just wish they could use the same actor for The Avengers Age of Ultron. <br/><br/>Mystique, my favorite mutant, has a huge role and so that's amazing. <br/><br/>In the final scene when Mystique is deciding whether to kill Trask or not, and the camera is switching between past and future: best part in my opinion.

Whether fan-boy or average movie goer the new X-men with Bryan Singer back at the helm keeps you guessing with all your favorite mutants once again like you've never seen them. Hugh Jackman, who seems to be the face of the X-men delivers as always with his dry sense of humor. Jennifer Lawrence is more a focus in this one which makes sense. However James MaCavoy steals the show as the one and only Professor Charles Xavier with a great performance you'll never see coming. Not to exclude the rest of the cast, this rivals The Dark Knight franchise with a thriller like mentality that you won't wanna miss on the big screen."
"jimhrdennis","10","3","4","24 May 2014"," Must see for Marvel fans
","As a die-hard marvel comic book and TV show fan, to me this was the best film of the franchise. You will find elements from the old comic books, you will also find elements of the animated X-Men series of the 90's and even a little from the Wolverine and X-Men animated TV series like the adaptation of the creepy sentinels of the future who adapt and steal mutant powers. In conclusion I really liked the way it tied all the previous films together the way it should have been in the past, I did have a few issues here and there but I will still give it a 10/10 just because I did not want it end and I was very satisfied at the ending. Don't forget to stay and watch after the credits now let's bring on X-Men: Apocalypse in 2016 and I hope they have another X-Men animated series on TV soon but yeah, excellent movie and must see!"

","I've never really cared much for X-Men in any format, but I did like 2011's 'First Class'. Unfortunately, despite a few clever bits, I found 'Days of Future past' to be a rather flat re-hash of the tired X-Men formula; Humans are afraid of mutants. Xavier and Magneto argue over how to deal with this. Blah, blah, blah. It's been five movies of this same sort of thing now. It's beyond played out.<br/><br/>For the uninitiated this is likely to be a rather confusing slog. There are a lot of characters and story elements here that have little to no set up, and much of it goes back several films. And even for those who have been along for the ride there's not much pay off here. You can see every twist and turn coming from a mile away.<br/><br/>'Days of Future Past' is a well made, well acted, but ultimately mediocre film."
"bob the moo","Null","4","6","5 October 2014"," Enjoyable and satisfying blockbuster thanks to engaging narrative which is well delivered by all
","I don't remember being overly taken by the previous X-Men film, although I may be wrong because it has mostly slipped from my memory after it took quite some time for me to get around to watching it in the first place. Days of Future Past came out in a busy summer season and it did strike me as just another superhero blockbuster in a very crowded marketplace. Although it of course has much in common with other superhero films, X-Men doesn't directly take them on at their own game and, although it has the odd touch here and there, it deliberately avoids the knockabout comedy that The Avengers film and some of its offshoots has. Instead we get a darker plot that begins in the future where mutants are either enslaved or killed by robots designed specifically for that purpose. The plot device that triggers the time-travel is as easy to accept as anything else in the film, and it is delivered fairly straight which also helps. This gives us a plot where we know the stakes and the film plays it very well to keep things dramatic.<br/><br/>Having very recently been disappointed by the superficial thrills of Godzilla, I pleased to find that Days of Future Past was an engaging and satisfying film to watch – although I personally think that its current very high rating on IMDb is partially down to an overreaction to low expectations set by First Class. The plot has some good twists and turns and it connects the future and present well. Special effects are well used throughout, with plenty going on that is visible (I'm looking at you Godzilla) and most importantly, is connected to the plot; so yes the film has spectacle, but it is spectacle that the viewer cares about rather than passively watches.<br/><br/>The cast helps give the material some weight and, although some of them have comparatively little to do, they all do well enough with what they are given. Jackman is as good as presence as ever and there is a reason he and this character remain so constant through the series. Fassbender and McAvoy have good material to work with and they engage and convince as to their connection to their future castings of Stewart and McKellen. Lawrence is surprisingly good and although she seems a bit out of place at first, it is her performance that makes her character work. Dinklage is always watchable and he fits in well amongst a cast that includes many famous faces in roles small and big. The balance of all these names and faces is down to how enjoyable the script is, because even though we barely see some people, it makes sense within the context of the story being told, so doesn't feel like they are wasted (although I could have done with a few fewer in the final scenes).<br/><br/>Days of Future Past is perhaps not as amazing as the high IMDb rating suggests, but it is an enjoyable and satisfying superhero movie with good edge and seriousness in the plot, which is all played straight aside from a few moments, helping it carry it off and keep the viewer engaged."

","www.tgchan.pl <br/><br/>I never liked movies with multiple super heroes, it feels like there is too much for me... or maybe I am too egoistic? :) Well let's see what this film got to offer! 5 minutes - and it already looks like it is one of these movies where you can't even blink because you will lose tons of action! Not that it is a bad thing but I love to eat different things while I am watching and it won't let me do it! I don't believe I have to mention that the special effects are top notch, right? >:D <br/><br/>20 minutes - I am already deep in love with the movie!!! Amazing cast! Amazing story zomfg can't wait to see more! <br/><br/>45minute - O M F G I am crushed how amazing this movie is!!! and it's funny too!!! Like really funny! and to think... I am saying all this not being an X-men fan at all :)<br/><br/>Somewhere in a middle it feels like the movie slows down a little but it is coming back to its original pace after a while.<br/><br/>Annnnnnnnnnnnd it is over. I have finished watching it... yep it steps down a little from the point I have mentioned above. The first half was just simply one of the best things I have seen in a long time, the second part is not bad but you can feel a significant difference. The whole movie is still an amazing thing to watch. Actually it made me want to re-watch some of the older X-men movies.<br/><br/>Now it is a little tricky to rate it... as the first part of the movie was 11/10 and the second something like 7.5/10... but my final score is...<br/><br/>(oh snap! just as I was writing this, the end credits were rolling down and guess what!? There is a short scene at the end of the them !~!! make sure you don't miss it!)<br/><br/>tgchan's rating: 8.5/10"

","Was supposed to write this in goofs but maybe interested viewers can find this a major critique as well and some geek out there can help me out. Good movie and production overall. Just one thing: How in the world is Prof X is still alive? Reboot you say? In that case, reminiscing Jean Grey's demise IN this movie by Wolverine himself then also pertains to the Prof's death in that installment! So how do these two fit together?? Medium-core audiences are supposed to just gloss over this? As mentioned, still a great watch- the story is good, a few goofs with references to items non-existent in the 70's, worth watching already if you're just gonna replay scenes with Raven in it- Jennifer Lawrence is super, super hot. Best character for pimply fans of xmen and material for a fantasy porn raven- a sexual partner that can change to anyone, or ANY PART of her that you desire... whoops, just veered off. I'll cut here."
"Blazs91","8","4","6","29 September 2014"," A surprisingly pleasant X-perience!
","First of all, I need to clarify, that I barely able to watch any Marvel movie. Not because consider them bad. No! Not at all! All of them are high quality productions of the Hollywood film factory. Despite of that I've seen all the X-Men movies so far, and after watching the First Class I couldn't wait for this one. And it totally worthed it!<br/><br/>The story is well-presented, I was fairly delighted with the whole time-traveling idea. Although there were some loops in it, but I do not want to mention them for now. The acting performance is can said to be almost beyond compare, apart from a few exceptions. Magneto was great and almighty, Mystic was graceful and sexy as hell, Wolverine was pure Wolverine, etcetera, etcetera. We had the honorable opportunity to meet with quicksilver, who I bet is gonna be the favorite character of everybody. He was cool and hilarious, and you would want to spend more and more time with watching him in real- time"" action.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender just became eligible enough to get a goddamn Ocsar at last! He's just killed his character! Magneto has almost never been so original than this time! I think I'm gonna sit down and write an anthem for him after I finished my review.<br/><br/>The visuals boosted with 3D were phenomenal. Especially I've fallen in love with the chick with teleportation ability. That just has made the action sequences simply so creative and cool! The robots were also well-designed and bad-ass, and this is the movie, in which cannot see a little drop of blood, but the fighting scenes create a so brutal atmosphere, that it could almost hurt us, when we can witness a character's death. The robots are tearing the mutants into pieces and beating the s**t out of them with no mercy. The five minutes long introducing scene was almost smashed my 3D glasses. So the visuals are absolutely great, and they can make us feel the tension and pressure on our shoulders, what the mutants are bearing too.<br/><br/>Is this movie faultless? Nope! One of my main problem was Wolverine, sorry folks! We can him on screen far more than any other (more important) characters, and most of the time he didn't do anything special. I don't understand why the makers of the movie wanted to sell their product to us with Wolverine. They could have done him without him too. This man didn't managed to make any successful conversation, and I felt that his only role was to show his abs and unrealistically aesthetic body in the first half of the movie, because Jackman has never been ripped as hard as now. The dialogs are painfully simple, and movie gets started slightly sluggishly because of that. But it's only a really tiny mistake.<br/><br/>Mystic! She is so attractive and charming, but that's the problem. She was put right into the focal point of the movie, but the primal purpose was to show her naturally elegant physique, so aesthetics again. I bet the male members of the audience cannot take in what really happens when she is on the screen, because the sight of her naked blue body and her extremely cool and jaunty fighting moves. I consider it another tiny mistake, but I must admit that I totally loved it!  Mystics other mistake is that she could be easily manipulated. Her decisions are hardly influenced by the decisions of the other male characters. But why? She could have been a separately intelligent character, who can take things in her hands and manage them effectively.<br/><br/>Despite of the mistakes in the characters, the movie manages them very well. I mean that every character has its own personality, own purpose, own beliefs, which are varying from one to another. And this the secret of the perfect editing! There are several female and male characters, but we cannot consider any of them evil or good. The movie provides the option for each individual member of audience to personally choose who he/she wants to be the good guy and who to be bad guy. All characters are fighting for his/her noble goal, and I've changed my side severally during the story.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is epic and MARVELOUS! The music composition was excellent, totally fitted into the environment. The humorous moments were hilarious, the fighting moments were savage and cruel, the sentimental moments were emotional enough. So almost every details were appropriately accomplished. All my respect for the crew!<br/><br/>Thanks for spending your precious free time with reading my review! Hope you liked it!"
"haosstoposto","9","4","6","29 September 2014"," Splendid finale for the X-Man (and possibly a base for many sequels:))
","X-Men - Days of the Future Past excels in every aspect. It has a clever story (which is a hard thing to do in a time-travel movie), superb action and suspense. Basicaly it is a mixture between the Terminator and Matrix, our heroes try to manipulate the past in order to achieve some better future for the almost-extinct mutants and the oppressed mankind. And the future is grim indeed, and visually fascinating. The mutants have been hunted down because Homo Sapiens in its fight for survival in the evolutionary process managed to create super-robots which are able to confront superpowers. The battle scenes between the Sentinels (robots programmed to hunt down mutants) and the remaining X-Men are stunning. X-Men are facing a lost cause and that way we have some real suspense on the screen. In every battle before, ordinary humans have been only a cannon fodder, but with the sentinels all bets are off. As for the time travel story, our remaining heroes sent Wolwerines conscience in his young body to try to prevent the creation of super robots and perhaps to save a soul of the shape-shifting mutant Raven/Mystique. The story background in the seventies is very cool and of course it is a good thing that we have some different languages in the movie. I always found irritating that in the most movies we don't hear foreign languages, but have bad English with a foreign accent. Nacis are best example for that. This time everything fits together and as a result we have excellent movie. And it is always a pleasure to see Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen share a screen, this time as allies. Go and see it, you will not regret it."
"adamscastlevania2","8","4","6","28 August 2014"," X-men return and they are better than ever
","(73%) I have a very strong feeling that this is the best X-men movie so far. It has all that made ""First class"" a fine rebooting chapter, only with a greater array of characters, a swifter pace, with more comedy and more action to enjoy. The plot, despite the vast amount that happens, is pretty simple and well assembled, and everything throughout feels like the makers actually cared about making a good movie and not just a milk cow for the big studio's coffers. This is a very enjoyable, well put together, big hitter that's well worth a trek to the cinema, and will likely mark a high point in this year's superhero movie line up."
"Vartiainen","Null","4","6","2 July 2014"," Pure fan indulgence with great production values
","X-Men: Days of Future Past is certainly an ambitious project, attempting to stitch together both film franchises, the original X-Men trilogy as well as the 2011 semi-reboot X-Men: First Class. And the way it accomplishes this is certainly both effective and commendable. The story is believable, most of the important loopholes get closed and as a whole it's just a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The best thing here are the actors. Pretty much all the actors from both franchises reprise their roles, which is an impressive feat and all around heartwarming. The main show belongs to Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) as well as Patrick Stewart/James McAvoy (Charles Xavier) and Ian McKellen/Michael Fassbender (Erik Lehnsherr). All five are talented actors in their own right and they absolutely nail these characters and give us some really good character moments. The rest of the cast is equally up to the task and it's great to see so many of them in the same film, seeing that X-Men has always been about a group of people coming together to fight greater evil.<br/><br/>But here I have to be honest and admit that I was kind of expecting more from the story. Once again mutants are threatened by evil, bigoted men and it's up the X-Men to stop this threat before the society slides out of balance. We've seen this before, and while the execution here is superb and allows an old story to feel refreshing, it's still an old story. And there were a couple of clear points in the movie, where they could have broken the mold, but instead they went with the expected. Sure it's faithful to the comic books, but these characters are so huge that there would have been room for variance.<br/><br/>And that leaves me with a conundrum. I loved the characters, I loved the action scenes, I loved the production values, but I honestly cannot say the same about the story. I didn't dislike it either, but it could have been so much better with so little effort. The film is still worth seeing, easily, but you should be advised that if you're expecting something new story-wise, you're not going to get it. Although the final ending is great in its own indulgent way."

So nice to see Jean Grey again. and so many old friends and familiar faces! So nice to have a good storyline that is intriguing! Thanks to Bryan Singer's return!

"jul-kinnear","9","4","6","19 June 2014"," The Most Satisfying Mutant Movie So Far
","This film is a hot mess of goings-on that challenge viewers to various degrees for their attention. And in many ways, these efforts are rather successful. Whether you will enjoy this film lies in whether this is an experience you will be all right with. In director Bryan Singer's X-Men: Days of Future Past, we as viewers deal with the presence of two series worth of X-Men casts, a time travel story that forces viewers to juggle a number of plot points in lieu of a more fluid plot, a splattering of subtle references to other elements from the X-Men universe, as well as a mélange of historical and cultural references — some of which exist in a retroactive continuity thanks to the humans with mutant abilities and the effects of their presence in the world.<br/><br/>Even though it had been a decade since Bryan Singer directed an X-Men film (2003's X2), he does so here with the confidence and ability a dedicated expert. Singer had a difficult job in reconciling conflicts of story continuity between the first three X-Men films, the Wolverine films, and the series' most recent instalment before this, X-Men: First Class. But Singer manages to bring everything together and adjust the details so that they make sense for the most part.<br/><br/>More committed fans of the franchise and the comic books will probably take issue with conflicts that would be more glaring to them, but as a general movie-going experience, the film is far from unpleasant. In fact, it's rather exciting. It's a time-travelling adventure, and as such, it carries with it consequences on a scale much grander than previous films in the franchise. This film creates much grander stokes befitting a world filled with super-human beings. It also jumps ahead in creating what feels like a much more expansive mutant-filled universe that has been around for much longer than we viewers have seen up to this point — especially if we consider the post-credits scene and the deep implications it carries, which viewers familiar with the X-Men comic book universe will instantly understand.<br/><br/>The plot of the film itself is adapted from one of the comic book franchises most legendary story arcs. It's a story from 1981 where mutants in the future are hunted to near-extinction. A member of the X- Men travels back in time so they may alter history. The heart of the film is easily the interplay between the young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and the young Erik Lensherr, or ""Magneto"" (Michael Fassbender), as they struggle in a heart-wrenching back-and-forth over the troubles their friendship faces and their hopes for the future of mutant-kind. Their future counterparts, played by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, accomplish much to convey the grim and dire situation their young selves fight to erase. There's a tone in this movie unmatched by any of the other occasions where these actors have portrayed these characters on film.<br/><br/>Ellen Page, in her role as ""Kitty Pryde,"" is worthy to further recognition as well. Her character, whose ideas and power prove to be a lynchpin to the whole movie's plot, is an intelligent, brave, fearless soldier who proves herself to be just as multidimensional in character as any of the actors and characters that have come before her in this film franchise. Plus, Peter Dinklage, of Game of Thrones fame, makes for a curious villain, as he not only seeks to eliminate mutant-kind but also proves at the same time to be fascinated by them, making him far from the one-dimensional villain many feared he would be. Ultimately, it may be Jennifer Lawrence as the ever-popular character ""Mystique"" who steals the show. She's just as much a lynchpin to this cast as Ellen Page, exercising her well-established acting skills with wildly successful finesse and depth of emotion.<br/><br/>The plot of X-Men: Days of Future Past is easily the most satisfying in the franchise's history — and the most fluid. It drops the need to reintroduce old characters, doesn't spend too much time on new characters, and moves immediately towards the plot that carries this film towards its end. This approach reflects self-confidence in the film franchise, as it assumes fans who are familiar with the series are in fact familiar with the series. The franchise is so popular that it doesn't have to spend much time re-introducing characters and recapping previous events in the franchise. Perhaps this is a presumptuous move, but it proves very helpful in terms of efficient plot delivery. It uses the audience's presumed fandom to move faster and go further than it could if it were continually stopping to reintroduce characters and explain the setting — which is good, because this instalment is perhaps the most narrative-driven. The downside to this is approach is that this makes the film less of a movie to new fans and crafts itself more towards as product for returning fans.<br/><br/>In the end, the film is definitely worth the price of admission. It makes for an adventurous, fantasy-filled piece of alternative history storytelling and emotionally compelling action."

","The hype may have left me ultimately underwhelmed. For a film which was chalked full of potential, I can't help but feel it could have been a lot better. No denying it was a good film, on the same level as X2 and First Class give or take half a star. The future scenes were immense, Sentinels were insanely overpowered! Quicksilver's part was as good as it was brief. The best parts of the film were so short that throughout the rest of the film, I longed for more, rather than appreciating the Mystique Show. I felt Wolverine particularly wasn't used properly. The past really missed out on introducing characters to the full story rather than just the 1 in a bit-part role. Overall, a good superhero film, but not the classic I hoped for and in all honesty, expected."

Is that like 'Back to the Future' articulated so clumsily that it makes your head spin? And if these freaks had a time machine all along, why did it take them so long to turn it on? It doesn't even matter, because I'm just exhausted by the idea of humans and mutants waring up to wipe each other out. Have the damned war already. Isn't it like 20 years now that we've been put on the edge of our seats over this war that's coming? My sensitivities have been callused over, I don't care about mutants anymore.

At last, Jennifer Lawrence is finally learning to act, she does show some good emotions instead of her usual stony face.<br/><br/>The movie loses pace in between with footage being wasted on the above mentioned sissy fights between McAvoy and Fassbender.

"p-stepien","9","7","13","2 June 2014"," Comic enjoyment intertwines with top notch acting and excellent human drama
","In the convoluted time-travelling plot of X-Men: Days of Future Past, Fox molds two X-Men franchises into one, by colliding the future mutants, now living in the post-Sentinel cleansing wastelands of Earth with the past versions of themselves from Nixon-era 1970s. With mutant genocide bringing about the collapse of civilisation, the remnants of the mutants, including core X-Men members: Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Bishop (Omar Sy), Blink (Bingbing Fan), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Warpath (Booboo Stewart) and the once infamous Magneto (Ian McKellen) attempt one last daring ploy to avert the imminent disaster. This means Wolverine must be sent into the past with the use of Kitty Pryde's powers to stop the murder of Sentinel mastermind Dr Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) by mutant rights activist turned rogue Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). The future's hope lays in averting the past - thus Wolverine must force the downtrodden and resigned drunkard Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and the imprisoned Eric Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) to stop the occurrences of days to come from ever coming into being. Only Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and a fickle youth Quicksilver (Evan Peters) are willing to aide the best at what he does...<br/><br/>Amongst the many faucets of success of Bryan Singer in he reclaiming of the franchise, one seems to be strongly undervalued by most viewers. Despite an onslaught of characters the X-Men are rejuvenated thanks to one simple truth: not all character need to be character studies and albeit each of the cast receives their moment in the limelight, the X-Men resonate all so much more strongly that the super-powered mutants need no introduction. To a varying extent introduced in previous episodes of the series, most of the characters function as direct imprints from the comics, cartoon series or previous movies with the entire mythology appropriated to them. They need not be presented, delved in, they just function as part of a well-oiled team of superheroes. Much like in the comics the movie finally understands that focus can only be placed on a select number of characters, the rest operate within action sequences to wow the audience into submission, while the drama evolves around just a few in their midst.<br/><br/>Thankfully also focus shifts away from Wolverine, the franchises most important and recognisable character, towards the trio of Professor X, Eric Lensherr and Mystique. Wolverine still features heavily in the plot, but is mostly a backup cast member with limited impact on proceedings, but with charm and character attributes helping to liven up the story throughout. Nonetheless McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence shine with a well-thought out plot centred around the morality of Mystique and the dark path she has chosen to follow. Support cast is unanimously superb within their characters, even if they receive but a few minutes of screen time they each memorably capture their moments: Storm is godlike and enchanting, Colossus is almighty, Blink has a lingering presence, Iceman is all-powerful, while Magneto of the past and future display their otherworldly power. Quicksilver naturally steals the show, but Singer has improved in leaps and bounds in his presentation of fight sequences. Only Bishop cries out for more screen time and focus, which hopefully he will receive come X-Men: Apocalypse.<br/><br/>Also thoroughly enjoyed the teamwork, so key to the comic book, that is on show throughout all the future sequences of battles with Sentinels.<br/><br/>It says a lot that the two mayor flaws of the movie are its short runtime of 130 minutes (it honestly feels like the movie could easily go on for another 60 or so minutes and never lose traction on the audience) and the fact that we have to wait for the next episode of the series for another 2 years (how I wish this was a mega-budget several episode series...). Minor faults of the feature are some laboured story, which at times struggles to piece together the plot holes of past episodes, and the somewhat funny, but ultimately jarring, jokes centred around Magneto's supposed involvement in the assassination of J.F.Kennedy.<br/><br/>By far the best comic-book movie of the year and arguably only inferior to ""The Dark Knight"". The mouthwatering prospect of X-Men: Apocalypse is just too far away to bear..."
"sanddragon939","10","7","13","1 June 2014"," A superb celebration of the entire X-men franchise!
","One of the most eagerly awaited superhero films of the decade (if not, like, EVER), 'X-men Days of Future Past' certainly hasn't been crushed by the weight of ginormous expectations placed on it - rather, it has far surpassed those expectations to become one of the greatest comic- book films of all time. In my opinion, DOFP may well lay claim to inclusion in an elite club of superhero films that includes The Dark Knight and The Avengers.<br/><br/>Indeed, Bryan Singer's task in DOFP was far more ambitious in some ways than Joss Whedon's mission with 'The Avengers'. This time, it wasn't a bunch of superheroes that had to be united on screen, but rather two disparate franchises within the X-men franchise - the world of the original X-men trilogy (with Jackman, Stewart, McKellan et. all), and the 'prequel' world of 'X-men First Class (with Hoult, Fassbender, McAvoy et. all). And he does so masterfully, uniting the two eras of the franchise into one cohesive whole...further developing the younger cast of 'First Class' while also giving a fitting tribute to the ones who started it all.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman of course is the star of the movie, who literally bridges the two casts just as his character Wolverine uses time-travel to bridge the two eras. But the true protagonist of this film is James McAvoys's younger Charles Xavier. In 1973, Charles is a far cry from the wise mentor and leader embodied by Patrick Stewart - he is a tortured soul, a drug-addict who has numbed his mutant powers in order to be able to sleep peacefully, a man who has seemingly lost his purpose. In an interesting inversion of their relationship from the original films, Logan is forced to mentor the young Charles and set him down the path to becoming the legendary Professor X. Michael Fassbender does a great job as the younger, more militant Eric Lensherr/Magneto. And Jennifer Lawrence's Raven/Mystique is of course the lynchpin of the film's time- travel plot. When we last saw her in 'First Class', she was torn between the opposing paths of Charles and Eric. The original trilogy would have us believe she is destined to become Magneto's ally and fellow mutant terrorist...but if this film teaches us anything, its that the 'future is not set'...<br/><br/>Despite the focus on the 'First Class' cast (Wolverine notwithstanding), many of the characters from the original cast get their moments to shine in the midst of the final desperate battle with the mutant-killing Sentinels-most notably Ellen Page's Kitty Pryde, Patrick Stewart's older Professor X, and Ian McKellan's Magneto. Also, while the film in many ways functions as a direct sequel to 'First Class', owing partly to the time-travel plot and partly to the return of franchise creator Bryan Singer, this film feels more or less like a spiritual sequel to X2 - from the use of the soundtrack of that movie, to a number of homages and callbacks to that movie.<br/><br/>On the whole, DOFP is both an ending and a beginning (a fitting thing for a time travel movie to be!) and leaves you excited for the next installment in this, the longest-running superhero franchise ever!"
"monstermayhem32","9","7","13","28 May 2014"," A great way of blending the old and new cast
","I remember when watching the post credits scene of the wolverine how excited I was to see the film and boy it did deliver.the storyline takes place in the year 2023 in which the mutants are humans are being hunted by the sentinels as a result of an event in the past which created a dark future, I would say that one of the highlights of the film was the wonderful performances of Hugh Jackman, James mccavoy, Michael fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Ian mckellan, and Patrick Stewart. One of the scenes that I felt was rather touching was when the younger Charles encountered his older self reminding him to hope again and a rather touching moment between older Eric and Charles, Evan peters was quite funny as Peter. However I did feel that some characters were underused like rogue who appears in a very brief cameo. I thought bishop was interesting but the other characters like blink, sunspot, and warpath were not given much to do. However I would say the events of this film set up the next adventure x men Apocalypse,"
"SunSg","4","9","18","24 May 2014"," A disappointment
","I went to watch the movie looking for a action movie and what I got was a drama....!!! Definitely not worth watching in 3D. So do calibrate your expectations before you book this show. The movie starts off and it had me glued .... For a moment I thought it was Xmen combined with the Matrix , the attack on Xmen is almost in similar manner and by similar threats - sentinels, and same dialog ( ""they are coming"" , ""they found us "") but that's the limit of similarity . The action sequence was a bit boring or rather More confusing then exciting. The seniors come in after that and then it enters the drama mode and becomes a drag. The scenes with Quicksilver brings some excitement but a short lived one - Worth watching. By the climax magneto comes in action, makes things interesting for a while, but again doesn't get his normal exposure, what one would be used to seeing. Halle Barry / storm almost non existent in the whole movie, so don't expect to see her much. Off the female Xmen only Raven gets a good footage, but in most of it she is shown as the naive little girl... All in all I would say not that great to talk about and the 2 hrs + duration doesn't help too..... :-( ."
"Aaron1375","9","6","11","9 June 2014"," Was not sure what to expect, but I ended up enjoying the latest X-men film
","I am one of the few people out there that apparently enjoyed X-men: The Last Stand. I thought the film had the best battle scene of the original trilogy as it actually had the first real team battle instead of being Wolverine versus various mutants and people. I had heard that this one was going to wipe away that film, but in reality, this film pretty much wipes all those films away, but does so in a bit more imaginative fashion. Like a reboot, but not in a way. We get the cast of the old films and the ones from First Class in a time travel story that works for the most part.<br/><br/>The story has the mutants in a desperate situation as Sentinels have been created to cleanse the Earth of all existing mutants. We witness, right away, the terror they can inflict as they wipe out some of the toughest mutants around with ease. This Sentinels adapt to their targets and are able to inflict great damage. Well after this group of mutants is wiped out, we see them alive and well as one of the mutants, Shadowcat, can now send a person back into their former self and that person then warns of the impending Sentinel attack and they then abandon their hiding spot and find a new location. Professor Xavier and Magneto are now on the same side and Professor X has a plan to send his consciousness back into his former self to the time the Sentinel program took off and stop Mystique from killing a man by the name of Trask as this leads to her capture and her ability to morph leads to the super adaptable Sentinels. Unfortunately, Professor X can not survive the time jump, but Wolverine can. He makes his way into the past and must convince not only Professor Xavier, but also Magneto that they must stop Mystique and thus stop the horrific future.<br/><br/>The story was pretty good and I liked that Beast played a huge role in this film. I also enjoyed Quicksilver's time in the movie. Still, the emphasis is on Wolverine, young Professor Xavier and young Magneto. Granted, the best action takes place in the future as the Sentinels once again locate the remaining mutants hiding place. They did a lot of good things here, but I am a bit perplexed as to why they insist on making Mystique such a huge part of these movies. I can understand Wolverine, as he was everybody's favorite and he was in the comics a whole lot, but when I collected comics heavily for three years I literally did not have but maybe two comics with Mystique in it. One a back issue featuring Cable's first appearance and another an annual that had a couple of short stories detailing the downfall of her group Freedom Force. While perplexed, it did provide for an interesting story and so I guess I will roll with it even though I find it highly unfair that the females who saw this got to see Wolverine's bare buttocks while all us guys get is a smurf with all the best parts distorted.<br/><br/>In the end, I really enjoyed this X-men film more than I thought I would and I am also very excited about the next film that will finally feature another X-men villain that should have been featured before now considering the amount of X-men movies there are now. The film did have some strange moments and there were some off screen deaths that were a bit puzzling and I did not care for, but overall the film had some nice action and an interesting enough storyline to keep it all together and not seem like a film where they were simply trying to shove every mutant possible into the film just because they could."

"dlpburke","5","15","35","8 June 2014"," Very average.
","Unless you are one of these people still dazzled by fight scenes and graphics, this film will be very average for you. 7/10 is about the most I would expect any sane person to bestow upon this (and IMDb has proved yet again that there are far more stupid people about than intelligent ones).<br/><br/>Firstly, when going into a film based on a comic book, you have to extend your suspension of disbelief. If I came into this review lambasting the far fetched powers, then that would be rather silly. Although X-Men is based in our world, being a comic book, it is afforded some leeway. Even so, I would just like to point out that much of what goes on in the X-Men is scientifically impossible, so I don't rate it as a sci-fi... more a sci-fantasy.<br/><br/>I won't go into a big review with this film, because I don't think it really deserves that much attention. Instead, I will summarize: The Good: 1. The film is mostly well paced (apart from that stupid video game sequence at the start).<br/><br/>2. The acting is good.<br/><br/>3. The visuals are good. One scene in particular, which is in slow motion (you will know what I mean when you see it), is pretty cool and well made.<br/><br/>4. The characters are likable.<br/><br/>The Bad: 1. The X-Men's abilities are far too powerful, especially Magneto's. Not only does it come across as laughable, some of the things they achieve, but more importantly, it breaks the tension. Instead of fearing the worst for our heroes and for their future, we are constantly allowing for an 'anything can happen' scenario. There is one part of the movie where Magneto lifts a giant structure (no spoilers) off the ground like it is a piece of play-doh. That's all well and good, but without a shred of believability (even for X-Men), and without seeing some sort of limit to these powers, there is no dramatic tension. The movie does at least place limits on some of the other characters... for a time.<br/><br/>2. The plot is very basic. When I found out this film had a time travel element, I was interested. Unfortunately, that potential is wasted here, so don't go into this movie expecting some really well written time travel stuff. The way in which the time travel works in this film is not original either (despite some claims), and has been done countless times before- for example in Babylon 5 (my favourite show, and infinitely better written than this). The general plot is way too simplistic. The pacing may be decent, but the story just plods along. No decent twists or parts where you have to engage your brain. It's just auto-pilot storytelling.<br/><br/>3. JFK was killed by Oswald. I am sick and tired of seeing conspiracy garbage portrayed as reality. If you are a logical person, and have done proper research, you will come to the sane conclusion that Oswald did it. The odds on it not being him are astronomical, based on the wealth of evidence that exists. The film does include a twist in this regard, but it's an absolutely absurd twist.<br/><br/>4. Evolution does not work like this film supposes. There are too many writers out there that have no idea how it works, or how science in general works. When dealing with a film like the X-Men, you'd think they would hire proper advisers.<br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointed with the film, but it was still worth the watch, and the day out to the cinema. 6/10"
"claudio_carvalho","8","7","14","21 September 2014"," The Butterfly Effect
","In the future, the mutants and the humans that help them are slaughtered by powerful robots named Sentinels. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Magneto (Ian McKellen), Storm (Halle Berry), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) and her friends meet at a monastery in China and Xavier explains that the invincible Sentinels were created using the DNA of Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) that was captured in 1973 when she tried to assassinate their creator Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). Xavier tells that their only chance is return to 1973 using Pryde's ability to join Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender)to convince Mystique to give up of her intention. However, only Wolverine can withstand the damages of the time travel. Will he succeed in stopping Mystique and the Sentinel Program and save the mutants and their human friends from annihilation? <br/><br/>The screenplay of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is confused in the beginning of the story but soon there is the explanation of what is happening. The special effects are top-notch and the excellent cast completes this great adventure of the X-Men. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""X-Men: Dias de um Futuro Esquecido"" (""X-Men: Days of the Forgotten Future"")"
"jackasstrange","7","7","14","24 May 2014"," Rather dull and full of cheesy dialogs. Still, a watchable film.
","The film is okay. There are some ridiculous expository dialog at the beginning, some dull scenes such as when Charles(James MacVoy) punches Magneto in the face when he first see him in the elevator. I mean, what? It didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Also, Raven changing her body in public, where everyone could spot her. Really? So freaking dull. Also, it's impossible to deny the inconsistency of logic in the saga so far. And the plot is basically a rip-off of every successful Sci Fi film ever made. For example, the plot is almost a carbon copy of The Matrix. Just replace time-travel with a computer generated reality, and wham. And the ending is ripped off from Inception. Even the music score is similar.<br/><br/>But obviously, there are good thing music s about it.m<br/><br/>For example, QuickSilver character is probably the most awesome of the film, and despite having few screen time, he is in one of the best scenes in the film. Also, Peter Dinklage was surprisingly good. There are some memorable scenes in the film to keep the average viewer entertained.<br/><br/>So yeah, is probably my biggest let down of the year. Expectes much more from this film. Worth watching, but don't expect a 'The Dark Knight' quality.<br/><br/>7/10"
"KineticSeoul","8","5","9","29 June 2014"," My favorite X-Men movie so far...
","I thought this was going to be the most action packed X-Men movie so far. With LOTS of special effects and superpowers...I was wrong. However this has the most emotionally moving story in the X-Men movie franchise so far. It delves into humanity, subconscious, emotions, hope and destiny. There is actually quite a bit of memorable moments in this movie, mainly because of the depth and development. The plot is a bit complex for me to thoroughly explain, but it's about Wolverine going back to the 1973 in order the save the mutants in the future. From sentinels that can copy and adapt other mutants powers that are used against them. Which they got the advancement from Mystique's DNA. However shouldn't it be Rogue's power? It would have been cool to see the mutants actually have a chance against the sentinels. Anyways Wolverine is once again the main main main character who goes back in time to guide the younger Professor Xavier. Kind of like how Xavier guided Wolverine. The movie is called X-Men but the story mostly focuses in on Wolverine, Xavier, Magneto and Mystique. You do see the other mutants use their powers, but it doesn't play the main key parts into this movie. My main complaint with Wolverine in this, is the fact that he doesn't have his Adamantium claws so you won't really see him tearing crap up. This movie let's say is a refreshing start to a new beginning...Maybe. My favorite part in this movie is the Quicksilver scene in the kitchen. If people actually decide to make a Flash movie, maybe the budget won't be in the TV show. So when it comes to the Flash movie, I hope it can up the coolness from that scene. Overall this is my favorite X-Men movie so far even surpassing the second installment. It really is worth checking out.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"anirudh-bhatnagar","6","5","9","31 May 2014"," Was it really that X-cellent?
","It was nice to see some of the older caste back, you get a warm fuzzy feeling at the end. Time travel stories can be a bit convoluted but this was largely(not entirely) coherent. New mutants introduced to non comics readers were cool and 3d was quite decent. Acting was well done. Is it X-ceptional? Definitely not. The movie made very little sense to me having seen all of the previous movies. There were a lot of things that should not be happening with respect to continuity. There were times I felt script writers completely squandered the potential. Maybe it was set in alternate verse, but that is more DC than Marvel. Many questions that popped in mind that were not answered at all. Wolverine getting back his adamantium claw? Xavier alive and well in same body? Xavier and magneto came to wolverine in the past for help in the airport? How was that done when apart from wolverine, no one else can travel back more than a few weeks? The ability to transfer consciousness back in time, how does that work is never explained fully. How does raven/mystique know where to look for Wolverine at the end? Will wolverine no longer have adamantium bones and claws? Questions aside, slightly above average movie that gives a sense of nostalgia making you look beyond its shortcomings."

I expected a WOW series movie like the last few movies of X men. This movie rating should drop according to me because there was less of visual effects and animation then the movies released in first few years of the 21st century. There was less of action compared to old movies.<br/><br/>In the movie {first class (2011)} we were shown that the serum drawn from Raven's DNA was a failure but in this movie it is shown it is a success."

","According to me X-Men : Days of Future Past is not only the best X-Men movie but also the best Marvel movie. This movie showed all the characters of the X-Men franchise. The action and the special effects of the movie were outstanding. What made the movie a great masterpiece are the amazing actors such as Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, James Mcavou etc. It was so exciting to see Logan aka Wolverine to go the past and solve some unsolved issues. It was really amazing to see Jean and Scott at the end of the movie and it was also exciting to see the school as it was previously. Bryan Singer definitely brought his best to us. People who said that this movie was no good, so so and other negative comments really don't know how to be grateful. I think the movie was so great that any further improvement or development might have been impossible. Now waiting eagerly for X-Men : Apocalypse . We,the X-Men admirers expect the next sequel to be the best."

","X-Men: Days of Future Past is a 2014 superhero film based on the fictional X-Men characters that appear in Marvel Comics. Directed by Bryan Singer, it is the seventh installment of the X-Men film series and acts as a sequel to both 2006's X-Men: The Last Stand and 2011's X-Men: First Class. The story, inspired by the 1981 Uncanny X-Men storyline ""Days of Future Past"" produced by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, focuses on two time periods and Wolverine going to 1973 to save the future of mankind. The film stars an ensemble cast, including Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Nicholas Hoult, Shawn Ashmore, Peter Dinklage, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart. Simon Kinberg wrote the screenplay from a story conceived by him, Matthew Vaughn, and Jane Goldman. <br/><br/>The X-Men ensemble fights a war for the survival of the species across two time periods in X-Men: Days of Future Past. The characters from the original X-Men film trilogy join forces with their younger selves from X-Men: First Class in an epic battle that must change the past - to save our future. The X-Men send Wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutant."
"Dano-ho27","6","4","7","25 May 2014"," Started out interesting, ended stupidly.
","I sat down in my theater chair with high hopes. Having liked ""The Wolverine"" ""First Class"" and the first trilogy. And to me, the movie started out fine. But was Logan was put into the past, everything went downhill. No adamantium (sorry if misspelled) for starters, and not much of wolverine throughout the movie either. Mainly it was just him bickering with Charles, Beast, and Erik. And he was completely useless without the metal claws.<br/><br/>Now, I could go over the entire movie and the flaws I found in it, but I really I want to talk about the end and how it ruined the entire movie for me. Now, I am a big comic book fan, and I do not like it when movies make up some bulls**t just for movie sake. And maybe it's just me, but when you drop a friggin' stadium around the white house, pull a bunker out of the ground, and almost kill the President, not one mutant stopping another (mystique and magneto) is going to make everyone be like "" Mutants are fine by me"" and stop developing the whole sentinel plan. If anything those last scenes should make them want to make sentinels even more, to make sure something like magneto never happens again.<br/><br/>And then the scene where wolverine is recovered and mystique (posing as stryker) says she'll take him. How does wolverine get the metal then? Is stryker supposed to find him later? Are we supposed to believe that Logan was with mystique before him and Sabertooth get arrested and then put into the weapon x group? I guess.<br/><br/>And then the ending scene with Jean was complete crap. So wolverine doing everything he did in the past reset everything done in X2 and The Last Stand? That would those movies now pointless and irrelevant. Not to mention that Jean being alive would mean that ""The Wolverine"" movie never happened. Because Logan became a ""woodsman"" because of Jean's death. So all the events of ""The Wolverine"" never happened either. Making all 3 of those movies totally pointless.<br/><br/>""Days of Future Past"" was a disappointment."
"turdbadge","1","9","21","12 October 2014"," Haven't got a clue
","It's not often I watch a film where I haven't got a clue what's going on, but that's what happened in the case of X-Men: Days of Future Past: come the ending, I still hadn't the foggiest about what I'd just watched. The plot, if you can describe it thus, seems to be about a young man who's advised to commit suicide by his aged mentor, only to return as an ass-kicking 'demon warrior' with special supernatural powers. His job? To bump off the rest of the 'demon warriors' that are out there.<br/><br/>There's some English religious mumbo-jumbo talk in an effort to explain the discrepancies of the plot, but you'll be bypassing that in favour of checking out the various warriors and their special skills. By far the most interesting is an immortal fighter whose body bears the scars of each person he's killed – a neat idea that sadly isn't explore to the fullest extent, as it could have been with a more skilled writer behind it. In some ways, this is like a grown-up version of X-MEN, with the addition of a series of bloody and sadistic fight scenes.<br/><br/>There's action aplenty, and lots of CGI blood, but the choreography is pretty poor, it has to be said. Even worse is the script, which makes no effort to characterise each of the principals, so that the demon warriors themselves are more often than not interchangeable. The acting is dodgy to say the least, and director Bryan Singer needs to go back to film school to figure out how to make a real movie next time, instead of this silly, noisy nonsense."
"adityakumarprasad","4","9","21","24 May 2014"," Went in with lot of expectation, came out disappointed.
","Yes, that's true. It did not give me as much thrill as I would have expected from a X-Men series. I would rather suggest you watch X-Men: First Class, again. <br/><br/>The X-Mens send Wolverine back in time to alter an event where the government gets hold of Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and they use her DNA to make mutant killing machines. Hence the name of the movie. <br/><br/>The first half still went well as there was enough humour, thrill and action involved. Especially the scene where Magneto is being taken away from the Pentagon. <br/><br/>One laughable moment I would specially like to mention here is that Magneto was prisoned for killing of JFK and later he tells Professor that he was trying to save JFK and not kill him, since JFK was also one of them - a mutant! #TooMuch<br/><br/>Even though I love Jennifer Lawrence more than anyone in Hollywood, even though this movie has so much of her, the story line disappointed me and left me wanting for more. Less action, less thrill, less of everything that you expect from an X-Men movie. <br/><br/>I would rather watch The Hunger Games again and again to get more from Jennifer. She is too good in that movie, if you have still not seen it, do it now. <br/><br/>Special Mention: PVR's 3D glasses sucked big time. As always I repented not going for a 2D show. <br/><br/>Just like the earlier release this month - The Amazing Spiderman, I would ask you to give this X- Men also a miss."

For better or worse, there's a lot going on in this movie- future and past time-lines and characters...if I have one complaint, it's that there's so much to the story that some scenes happen too quickly just because they need to.<br/><br/>There are also some head-scratching lines of dialogue and plot elements (don't even get me started on how the time-line is supposed to work with the previous movies).<br/><br/>But that's all being technical, the movie succeeds where it needs to: the story is interesting, the acting is good, the action is pretty awesome (though we don't get as much as I wanted), and the effects are the best yet. <br/><br/>A lot of people are raving about this movie, and I hate to say I don't really know why- it was good, but not great. I wouldn't say it's the best X-men movie, but it's a welcomed addition."
"louis-loh","3","3","5","18 September 2014"," Time Loop-Hole
","I still struggle with movies that fail to address the linearity of time. Perhaps it's just me being pedantic or even narrow-minded when I say cause should always precede effect. Viewers of The Big Bang Theory might remember this scene:<br/><br/>Scene: Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters. <br/><br/>Sheldon: Leonard, it's two in the morning. <br/><br/>Leonard: So? Sheldon: So it's my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday? <br/><br/>Leonard: Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine. <br/><br/>Sheldon: You can't. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake. <br/><br/>Leonard: Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me? <br/><br/>Sheldon: Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious. <br/><br/>Leonard: What if I knocked you unconscious right now?<br/><br/>Sheldon: It won't change the past. <br/><br/>Leonard: But it would make the present so much nicer<br/><br/>In the same vein, the element of time travel is treated too loosely in this film, with no consideration for the subtleties of the butterfly effect. Had the film been able to substantiate and explain this alternate paradigm of non-linear chronology, it would have been a true masterpiece. Alas, the existing execution appears to be too convenient and easy for my liking.<br/><br/>However, seeing as the franchise is far from concluded, I can only hope that future instalments fill in these gaps."
"drawlife","7","3","5","2 August 2014"," A return to form for the X-Men franchise.
","Solid.<br/><br/>Right when the movie started, and the beginning credits contained that original X2: X-Men United score, I got a huge feeling of nostalgia and I knew I was in for a ride. <br/><br/>Bryan Singer pretty much fixes up most of the wrongs of the horrid X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. <br/><br/>This film uses time travel quite well, it's consistent and flows along very well. We spend a lot of time with Wolverine, Beast, Mystique, young Xavier and young Magneto. They all play an integral part into the story, and we get into the meat of things when Mystique is responsible for the creation of a new type of Sentinels that adapt to each mutant's power, effective killing them faster. The Sentinels created by Bolivar Trask also have the ability to target anyone that has the capability of passing on the mutant gene. It's why in the future, the Sentinels pretty much took over the planet, killing off everyone. <br/><br/>I loved seeing the future scenes with the Sentinels destroying the whole X-Men team. I loved all the action set pieces, and the visuals. Quicksilver in particular had a very memorable sequence in the film, despite his lame looking outfit. It was brilliantly executed and edited. <br/><br/>James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender display their fine acting as Xavier and Magneto. Here we see the friction between the two and it's displayed very well. Jennifer Lawrence has a lot more to do as Mystique this time around and her character is fleshed out more. Do I need to tell you Hugh Jackman is great as Wolverine? <br/><br/>There was a point in the film where there are some slow moments, but most of them are decent character moments, especially between Xavier and Magneto. Even though she is fleshed out a lot more than the pervious installments, all the Mystique subplots and elements to me slowed the film down, and didn't find at all interesting. The movie also keeps reminding you that Mystique is the key to the new Sentinels over and over again. Peter Dinklage is good with what he's given with, but with so many characters within the film, it comes within the territory that his role is nothing more than a two-dimensional villain. The time travel element worked really well, near the end, the climax of the film, thats where it becomes a bit choppy in the editing. Normally that worked for me most of the time, but there is a portion in the film where is so abrupt that it took out of the film here and there.<br/><br/>You can tell this movie has Bryan Singer's touch. It revitalizes the whole franchise. It re-writes all the wrong of X-Men: The Last Stand and some of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I LOVED seeing Cyclops and Jean Gray back alive. FINALLY the whole X-Men team is back. So great. I do hope they make an appearance in the sequel. <br/><br/>With that being said, stay after the credits. APOCALYPSE!!! <br/><br/>7/10"
"maxwell-pietsch","8","3","5","6 July 2014"," it was good bro
","This movie was tizzy.<br/><br/>One reason I might have liked this movie was because I saw it with my father. It was interesting. After watching this X-Men flick I skipped into the showing of How To Train Your Dragon 2. I enjoyed the second film for a bit then halfway or so through I laughed and felt a bit uncomfortable doing so (maybe it was a laugh or another emotive, like a squeal, or both in series). I didn't exactly feel comfortable laughing or squealing by myself. I really thought of the people's reactions to this around me and had an accompanying sense of discomfort. It was interesting because it showed me how when we are watching a movie with someone there is still this element of being there with them that is important for our enjoyment of the movie, which is applicably knowledge.<br/><br/>I liked how they just went to town with new mutant powers. Instead of keeping the film restricted to a couple powers they got creative and had dozens of new abilities, as things should be.<br/><br/>The actors were pretty solid, especially the guy who played the leader in Star Trek. Somehow his words slip out so elegantly. The guy who played the younger Xavier was good in some ways but has this sort of arrogant quality, or potentially an arrogant quality, which is not great for an actor to have.<br/><br/>I really liked some of the lines in the movie. This was a big deal. I liked how Wolverine said to the young Xavier that his best would be good enough because, you know, sometimes that is true. I also really really like how the old Xavier told the young Xavier to open up to suffering and that if he hoped, the suffering wouldn't overwhelm him.<br/><br/>The idea played out in the movie about nonviolence versus violence was really good too."

I don't want to reveal too, too much for those that have not seen this movie, but I will say thisPatrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellan, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry – you brought the past into the future – you guys are the epitome of great acting. To the newbies – James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence (J-Law), Nicholas Hoult, and a slew of new mutants – everything was just superb in every single way.<br/><br/>The movie defines what we should be in our future, not define us what we were once in the past.

","Its not like the movie was not fun, but if half of your crew falls asleep in a movie, something was definitely amiss, I guess in this case it was story. Here is a list of plot holes: 1. Why does Mystique reveal herself before killing someone 2. Why did Mageneto shot Mystique, why, was he planning to carry her body around the globe 3. Where did the super-fast guy disappear after the jail breaking. And if one is breaking prisons just for fun of it, Tyrion Lannister was correct, x men are dangerous 4.

"TBoSH-TDK","10","3","5","24 May 2014"," Meets the hype and surpasses it!
","The film starts out and already kicks off with the story; it manages to engage in the very first 5 minutes with an exciting, intense action sequence involving Sentinels and various X-Men. Right off the bat it's arguably one of the best action scenes in the X-Men franchise (it doesn't have that many) since the opening of X2. The story consists of Logan (Wolverine) being sent back to the past to stop Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing Bolivar Trask, who was developing the Sentinel program, which would be cancelled but then picked up after his assassination, given how dangerous mutants would show to be; so to stop her, he needs to recruit the younger versions of both Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr. The story picks up quickly and moves forward in a way in which it never feels slow or boring. The characters are great; even though there are too many (Logan/Wolverine, Prof. X from past and present, Erik from past and present, Raven, Bolivar Trask, etc.) to focus on, and the cast is spot on! Seeing veterans such as Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen star alongside modern talented actors like Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, etc. The movie has a lot of thought-provoking elements that will truly have you meditating about them for a while; it'll take you a while to pick a side.<br/><br/>Overall, very entertaining, great cast & characters, score is fine though not too memorable, great action, and the best part is that it's a big middle finger to X-Men: The Last Stand.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>This movie will satisfy you and leave you wanting more.<br/><br/>Stay 'til the end of the credits."

","So after watching X-Men: Days of Future Past on the night of release, I can honestly say that I have never been so emotional driven and impulsed with excitement since the day Avengers Assemble came to the silver screen. It was a film which took me by surprise (for which I am glad for), simply because of how each of the individual characters played a significant role to the overall plot and ultimately decided the fate of the mutants. <br/><br/>Much like how they portrayed it in the classic 1992's X-Men: The Animated Series, for which some of you will recognise some familiar faces in this film (thou shalt not be named) that I jumped out of my seat in excitement like a 13 year old Japanese fan girl. To those who haven't seen the film as of yet, you are missing out......BIG TIME!"
"ttron2000","10","3","5","22 May 2014"," BRAVO...I'm back on board.
","that's right. i can't believe I'm saying this, nor did i think it was possible, but the X-Men film series is back to being just as rich as its 2000 inception and its undeniably stronger 2003 sequel that brought warmth to the hearts of many a comic book dork on this planet. indeed, the films have experienced a massive creative downfall since director Bryan Singer's exit at the 3rd movie (which i hated) and while things looked promising with Matthew Vaughn's under-appreciated X-Men First Class, Singer's return has brought back the greatness of a terrific X-Men film. X-Men Days of Future Past may seem like an exercise in damage control (Singer's been clear about his regret in leaving the franchise), but that wasn't an issue while watching this intriguing chapter that's worth every second of a fan boy's attention. the year is 2023 and Earth is now a decimated wasteland, dominated by the destructive Sentinels, machines initially meant for searching out and killing mutants, but over time have overridden their programming and gone about the total extermination of everybody, human or mutant. idealistic telepath Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and hateful cynic/metal manipulator Erik Lehnsherr (Ian McKellen) unite once again as allies to fight this robotic evil in hopes of survival, but accompanied with only a scattered handful of fellow mutants, their futile efforts to battle these endless (not to mention adaptable and unstoppable) swarms of Sentinels force them to resort to a shaky form of mind-manipulation/time-jumping, controlled by Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page). this method is all but exhausted as they fear it won't be long before they're completely overrun. they're last move is to send the consciousness of Logan (Hugh Jackman), the ageless, regenerating Wolverine himself, 50 years into the past to link up with his body in 1973. this Hail Mary pass is meant to prevent the events leading up to the Sentinels creation. this means finding longtime friends/foes Xavier and Lehnsherr in a time where both men were at their most depressive states and when their relationship was never more bitter. then there's locating the vengeful shape-shifter Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), who's not only a big reason for Xavier and Lehnsherr's animosity, but an indirect player in the Sentinels's technological advancement. Logan, usually the most efficient of brawlers in Xavier's band of gifted badasses, is now the man who has to keep it all together, whether that means recruiting the troops, such as the super-fast smartass Quicksilver (Evan Peters) or arranging a prison breakout (beneath the Pentagon of all places), he only has so much time to complete his mission before the Sentinels of the future close in on Kitty and end it all right there. i already feel I've said too much, but wow, there's more. so much more. the movie is tightly-structured, beautifully shot, marvelously performed, and stands so well on its own, long forgotten are the excruciating X-Men 3 or the abysmal X-Men Origins (which Singer has shamelessly, hilariously, and wisely ignored ever existed). not all the discrepancies from former films are completely rectified, but after an opening battle (which includes the return of Halle Berry's Storm and Shawn Ashmore's Iceman as well as newcomers Omar Sy as Bishop and Fan Bingbing as Blink), you won't care. the ride is too great and the story too involving. what's more is that this is hands-down the best acted X-Men film to date. Jackman has never half-assed a performance in his whole career and this is no exception. as the anchor holding both past and future ships steady, the man knows this character better than anyone and even in the weakest of Wolverine installments, he just doesn't know how to suck...ever. the always luminous Lawrence doesn't just bring the same gravitas to Mystique as she did in First Class, but shatters through every level, whether it be emotional or athletic. Stewart, McKellen, Sy (who's very underused), and the always excellent Peter Dinklage as Sentinel designer and chief villain Bolivar Trask are flawless in their supporting roles. but it's Fassbender and especially MacAvoy who steal the show. these two master craftsmen not only stand well on their own, but their unique and toxic interaction is enough to make even the blandest of material watchable and here's a movie where every word is great. i couldn't stop myself from admitting that if the whole movie had just been the two of them sparring, i would've been okay with that. i was happy with everyone in the movie except Peters, who even with having limited screen time and an action sequence that brought the crowd to loud cheers, seemed too obnoxious to like. i may be alone on that, but that's on me. to say anything more would be pushing it, except to say you should be prepared for a fantastic story with a kickass finale and the very welcome appearances of some great cameos. believe me when i say that my doubts on this movie were heavy and i feared the worst without any hope for the best and this is the one case where all my doubts have been completely crushed, very much to my deep pleasure. this was a huge step in the right direction and if Singer was haunted by past mistakes, he's done right so far in his attempts to correct them. X-Men fans should see this and i seriously doubt many will be disappointed. i'm already excited to see it again. BRAVO!!!"
"TheNineOrders","4","13","37","22 May 2014"," Brian Singer...enough said
","Brian Singer has done nothing but stomp on the source material he claims to love so much. I have no idea were fan-boys get to idolize him so much. I have tried to visualize this franchise as a parallel universe (there are so many of those in the comics) but still I can't stand how lame the characters come through. X-men: days of future past is no different.<br/><br/>Plot: Instead of ripping the entire film, I am going to present a simple thought on the premise of the movie that will give you an insight on how badly people want to love this movie despite it's blatantly glaring flaws. The premise of this plot states that Xavier can transport a consciousness back in time to the younger self of the individual. It also claims that the strongest telepath on Earth (Jean Grey is dead remember) is too weak to survive the journey. They come to the conclusion that Logan is the perfect candidate to travel due to his healing abilities. Wait...what? Why is a healing ability a factor to the equation when Xavier is transporting a consciousness? No physical body is traveling otherwise there would have been two Wolverines in the film (which would have made for a far more interesting film with funnier moments than the ones they deliver through Quicksilver). Kitty Pride plays a part in the time traveling scheme again establishing that a physical body is being transported yet is just a consciousness. This building block alone makes the entire structure fall flat on its face. That it is entertaining, sure why not, but to say it is the best X- men movie is taking it to far. We are yet to see a decent X-men movie to date. The closest Mr Singer has been to a source material and mythology was with Superman Returns and everyone cra*+^# on that one (to me that movie is the best Singer has offered). One more thing, the fact that Jennifer Lawrence takes up so much of the screen time (due to her fame with the much crappier Hunger Games) let's me know the audience the producers were meaning to capture with this one.<br/><br/>Verdict: You might enjoy the visuals and the action. Quicksilver will deliver the funniest moments in the film. Peter Dinklage was a waste of a great actor. Brian Singer continues to stomp on the rich and vast source material to create his own versions of characters he says to love as if all his intention is to take the glory that rightfully belongs to Stan Lee. I'd personally wait for it to show on your premium movie channels."
"manu-gupta-iitm","4","7","17","25 May 2014"," Disappointing
","I had very high hopes from this one and I was very disappointed with it. First, there is absolutely no advantage of watching it in 3D. They haven't made good stuff that differentiates 2d vs 3d. Second, with such a brilliant case (jackman, mcavoy, fassbender, lawrence) this could have been much better but its just a mediocre plot. No substance Third, too much of dialogs and story-building that people are just talking talking talking all the time. X men movies have brilliant action sequences. This one is just pathetic on that. Fourth, I hate that every time Xavier is trying to explain Magneto / mystique about choice, being on the good side and bla bla bla. Oh come on we have already seen that. X men first class was awesome. But we cant keep hearing the same repeated words. Fifth, sentinels are an awesome and powerful imagination but we don't get to see enough of it. Just a few minutes scaring you that they are invincible and the entire x men cast is shown as too weak. Thats it. There is no real fight, no struggle."
"XweAponX","10","4","8","1 October 2014"," Bryan Singer's Crowning Achievement
","The first time this storyline from the comics was used, was in the great 1992 X-Men Cartoon. I suppose there were a couple other cartoon renditions of this as well, but those were not worth mentioning- The '92 Saban X-Men series did a fantastic job of rendering the Core X- Men and animating the tales which kept us saying ""Make Mine Marvel"" and ""Nuff Said"" all these years.<br/><br/>Finally, at long last, we have this story told in Live Action. Well, Live Action and some masterfully done SFX.<br/><br/>No one can doubt that Hugh Jackman has brought James ""Logan"" Wolverine to more life than any other cartoon rendition of the character, and even in the Comics his antics are always what you are drawn to. He's the best as what he does, and what he does ain't pretty, as he always reminds us.<br/><br/>The graphic image of Wolverine in Mid-Flight, Adamantium Claws Extended - The Iconic Image of Wolverine which is on one of the covers of the 1982 limited series, was shown in ""The Wolverine"" (On top of the Bullet Train), and his ""fastball Special"" was shown in The Danger Room scene in X-3, The Last Stand. So, what's left? Plenty: Just keep your eye on Bobby ""Iceman"", in X-3 he Iced Up Solid, in this he is finally able to do the stuff he can from the books.<br/><br/>One enigmatic figure from the comics had never made it into the films: ""Bishop"" (Omar Sy) - Other characters from the 'X-Force' side-team are also here, Sunspot (Adan Canto), Warpath (Booboo Stewart), and Bishop's Sister ""Blink"" (Bingbing Fan, in the comics she is actually deceased, and she appears as a Hologram from Bishop's Armband). So we have a nod to X-factor here are well.<br/><br/>The Original story had Kitty Pryde (Ms Ellen Page) as the one who this story revolved around, and Wolverine was actually Killed by the Modern Sentinels. In retrospect that story would not have worked as well as this, because of Wolverine's Central importance to the storyline that had been told starting from the first X-Men film.<br/><br/>Some of the other particulars have been changed as well, mostly to use concepts (And characters/actors) from X-Men: First Class - So mainly this was a unique opportunity to use two sets of actors for Magneto and Professor X. The only thing that is a problem, is that Patrick Stewart had appeared as a Walking Elder Professor X in ""X- Men Origins: Wolverine"" - And Xavier had lost use of his legs at the end of ""First Class"". But if you watch this film. you will see why it is not a problem: This film deals once again with Alternate Histories and Universes. This seems to be a common concept used in many media lately, most notably in ""Fringe"" which had ""Red and Blue Universes"". In a way, we have this happening in the X-Men Franchise, and if my guess is correct, the next X-Film will deal with the ""Age of Apocalypse"" which is a total mind-bender: IN fact Marvel changed the name of all of their major comics for six months while that story played out.<br/><br/>What is great to see always is another appearance/cameo by Mike Dopud, who was notable for playing at least 6 different guys in the Stargate Franchise. He has appeared in X-Men Origins: Wolverine as well as in X-2, hes just one of those faces that shows up in Hugh Jackman movies. Look for him here, in ""1973"".<br/><br/>This film has Wolverine living in a Split-Level Head: One head in the Present (2025 or so) and the other in 1973, so the action literally spans 50 years. Despite the changes to the story from the comics, this film connects all of the X-Men franchise films in a way I had not thought possible, and as much as I respect the work of the other directors, it took Bryan Singer to pull all the strings back together. IN my view, is was a huge mistake for him to go off- mission to make ""Superman Returns""- A movie that should have been made in 1980, which was actually made in 1978, but the scenes Marlon Brando had shot were simply not used in their proper context- Having Bryan direct that was not the best use of his talents, as X-3 suffered for it. Not that I did not enjoy X-3, Magneto picks up the San Francisco Bay Bridge and lays it across to Alcatraz... In this film, the younger Magneto does something almost as amazing. What was better, Magneto moving the Bay Bridge, or Superman moving a huge Kryptonite Continent? What we see here, makes those titanic events seem small in comparison.<br/><br/>Between X-3 and this film, we were shown just how powerful Magneto is, and that Jean Grey was even more so.<br/><br/>In this franchise, we've seen Magneto move bridges, Jean Grey Vaporize people, Logan regrow skin as fast as Jean could strip him of it, and Charles Xavier take habitation of his Brain Dead Half- Brother's Body. Prepare to see much, much more in this latest installment, and be prepared for the coming Apocalyptic Age, cos ""El Nabin Sur"" is coming."

The acting, direction (Bryan Singer is the safest pair of hands imaginable for the series), special effects and script were all brilliant. It is the perfect sequel for both the original trilogy and ""First Class"". I love time travel films - four of my Top 10 films fall into that category - and this is one of the cleverest in many a year. To that end, I loved the intertwining of the past and future towards the end of the film and the wonderful contrasts between Magneto's actions in the two timeframes. <br/><br/>The ending of the film was fantastic and I adored the cameos in its final minutes. The post-credits scene certainly whetted my appetite for the next film! It's a shame that I'll have to wait two years for it. This is now second only to ""Superman"" as my favourite superhero film.

"farhangpark-40-66371","5","4","8","26 June 2014"," Cliché mixture of The Matrix and Inception and Back to the Future
","I don't know, maybe I've just seen too many movies and shows that deal with the idea of time travel, but this film is cliché down to the roots.<br/><br/>So what angered me off the most? The whole idea of time travel. If time travel is possible, then you wouldn't be living in the world you're living in right now because you would have sent someone in the past to change things forever.<br/><br/>Again, if time travel is possible and someone's trying to change the past right now, why would I care what might happen to the people who live in the present? The person in the past has all the time to change their fates! There is no tension in what might happen to these guys. And of course, this is a superhero film so everything's going to work out just fine so really again there is no real tension in the scenes. Altogether, the film felt like a bizarre mix of three films:<br/><br/>1. The Matrix: in that film there were machines that connected humans to a program. Here we have Ellen Paige who sends people's conscience back in time. You decide which is more convincing! Also so much acting, Ellen: Just put your hands around Hugh's head and moan and groan a little. Just top notch. 2. Inception: the original film had three different levels of dream, pretty good idea. X-Men however decided that what happens in present time matters as much as what happens in the past and so lost my any kind of attention to one of the time lines or a quarter of the film. 3. Back to the Future: Not as much as the humor but actually the idea of time travel which doesn't make any more sense here than it made in that film. At least that one was funny.<br/><br/>Now I have criticized the film pretty harshly but there are some good moments here just as well.<br/><br/>The CGI is pretty cool, the 3D effect alright and the acting is quite acceptable, at least they shut Halle Berry up for most of the time and kept Ellen Paige to a minimum and painted Jennifer Lawrence in blue which actually made her more tolerable than her Oscar worthy performances!<br/><br/>Again if you have watched a total of 5 episodes of Family Guy, Rick and Morty or Community about time travel, there's really nothing you haven't seen before. If you're a fan, eating up a popcorn and enjoying the glasses, this might be just the film you've been waiting for.<br/><br/>PS: Don't waste your money on the 4D versions if they're around. The whole shooting scenes and kicks and rainy weathers just feel uncomfortable when they're turned into kicks in the back, hisses of water and actual sprinkles. Stick to the 3D version for Christs sake.<br/><br/>Final Rating: 5/10. Cliché but actually OK and at times enjoyable. Recommended for non-fans? Not really. Pretty basic time travel stuff."
"coljam21","5","4","8","28 May 2014"," Typical Super Hero Flick
","OK so honestly I went to the theater not expecting much and got what I paid for. All the super hero movies are starting to look the same. There's no more wow factor or element of mystery, just the same old story. The best part of the movie was quick silver and he was only featured for about 5 minutes. The movie was so inconstant that it couldn't even be held together with crazy glue. How can Professor X be there to send wolverine into the past if he was killed by the phoenix 4 x-men movies ago? Did they think we would forget that tid-bit?<br/><br/>Wolverine gets sent back to 1972 in an effort to help fix things and save Mystique, which is wonderful. Where I felt like I was slapped in the face was when a drop of her blood was recovered and Trask was able to extract her DNA for testing. Huh? Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought DNA did not exist in 1972. Also if a sentinel kills Magneto in the future shouldn't he have ceased to exist in the past?<br/><br/>Then you had the typical mass destruction that only mutants or super heroes can cause. At this point it's become so expected and dull that even Magneto putting a baseball stadium around the white house was not worthy of a second glance. All the CGI and epic battle scenes have become cliché. And all the super hero flicks are beginning to look the same."

But his delusions are spreading instead to even the ""bad"" guys, which makes no sense.<br/><br/>Plus, I'm not the hugest J-Law fan in the world and this was just a little too Mystique centric for me.

"iconic-sr","4","5","11","19 September 2014"," Why ""Days of Future Past"" has Ruined the X-Men Franchise
","Brief Overview: I was happy with the first two X-Men movies, and thrilled with the ""new direction"" the 2011 movie ""X-Men: First Class"" had taken. So needless to say, when I heard this movie was going to combine both casts into one movie, I was expecting the greatest X-Men movie to date, however, what really became of it was a lot of disappointment.<br/><br/>The Positives: I really don't have much to say in this category. It was nice to see both casts from the original ""X-Men"" and ""First Class"" united, but the overall performance was less than satisfactory. I must admit that I was pleased with the Charles Xavier of the past (played by James McAvoy), and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine wasn't too shabby himself.<br/><br/>The Negatives: I really wanted this film to do well, but it just fell short. This movie had so much potential, but it fell apart, starting with the script. This movie provided absolutely no transition from any of the previous films, and was filled with a lot of pointless chatter. So basically, Wolverine is sent back in time by Professor X and Magneto in attempts to rewrite history and save the mutant race from doom, from massive robots called sentinels. Well this goal was accomplished (mostly from Wolverine and Professor X of the past talking sense to Mystique and Magneto). What I really hated though, is once they did do this preventing the creation of the sentinels, somehow these change of events was able to bring back characters like Jean Grey (the Phoenix) and Cyclops. So in the end, everything that took place over the first three movies never happened (damn, did I waste a lot of time and money). The film was filled with bland acting, cheesy and brief fight scenes, and disappointing CGI considering other super-hero movies this year like ""The Amazing Spider Man 2"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" The script really wasted the talent of wonderful actors, that could have easily made this the best film.<br/><br/>The Conclusion: Despite most of the reviews out there, I gave this film a 4/10 because it really was a pointless film. It did nothing to develop the characters in any way, and actually set the characters back. The movie really felt like a drama than anything else, and can easily be argued for the worst X-Men movie."

","The film is full of loop holes. Not at all a worthy sequel to First Class. Logan, never fits into the xmen, ensemble. The franchise needed a big start, to bang the box office. So, he was cast in the first three installments. Now, he never really fits in, with McAvoy, or Fassbender or Ian. <br/><br/>In less than 15 mins, we get the whole plot of the movie, and there is no twist or surprise as the movie goes. <br/><br/>I was having, loads of hope on this movie. It's a big big fail. <br/><br/>This movie makes XMen, X2 and last stand, completely ridiculous. <br/><br/>In all these movies, US government, meets very often in discussing about the mutants. If mystique's murder and her capture, has given way to sentinels, then, where does the first part, second and other installments, come into picture. For more than, fifty years, the government just keeps talking abt mutants. <br/><br/>Is this a badly written franchise, by Marvels? or a poor execution?<br/><br/>First class, was very unique, in screen play, it had the twists and mind boggling action sequences and a gripping screenplay. This movie has a few amazing action sequences, but not well supported by the run up to such a scene. When Eric gets into act, I didn't have that amazing feeling, which I had in first class. <br/><br/>On the whole, a big let down from Marvel and Bryan Singer."

"Leofwine_draca","6","2","3","25 February 2017"," Time travel is an engaging addition to the X-Men franchise
","There was a lot of love for DAYS OF FUTURE PAST on its release. It's a sequel to the X-MEN prequel FIRST CLASS that also ties it in to the older cast from the original X-MEN trilogy of the 2000s. As such there's an absolutely huge and sprawling cast of characters but director Bryan Singer just about manages to keep a grip on things so that it doesn't get too confusing.<br/><br/>What surprised me about the film is that the much-lauded plot is nothing more than virtual copy of that seen in the TERMINATOR films, although perhaps as the comic pre-dated THE TERMINATOR it's James Cameron who did the ripping off. Certainly the story, about a future annihilated by sentient robots and the survivors sending back a sole hero through time in order to avert the disaster, is all too familiar, but that doesn't mean it's not fun.<br/><br/>DAYS OF FUTURE PAST is fun, that's for certain. There's a huge cast of familiar and unfamiliar faces and a constant stream of effective CGI to keep viewers occupied, so this is never a boring experience. The future scenes are clichéd and amount to little more than an FX showcase of robots vs. mutants with lots of mutant death to boot. The main story, which takes place in 1973, is better, benefiting from Hugh Jackman's likable Wolverine and James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender doing their best with their engaging roles. Some of it is still too familiar, a lot of it is too over the top, and Peter Dinklage's villain is oddly irrelevant, but this is still a fun watch, albeit not one I'll be quick to revisit."

"Dannyboi94","10","2","3","12 June 2016"," One of the greatest superhero films of all time
","I have never been a full X-Men fan, I have enjoyed each one of them, with the exception of Wolverine Origin (which was garbage). First Class was a great reboot of the franchise, but I never thought the sequel to that would as as great as it was.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, you are thrown into a fantastic story-line that draws you in. Seeing the old cast along side the new, was spine-tingling. The futuristic themes of this film work very well, and the film is edited perfectly to merge and blend the past and future. There is next to no complaints I have about this film, while this isn't the realistic superhero movie you would see in the Dark Knight trilogy, this film most definitely matches it in terms of emotional impact and entertainment,<br/><br/>The acting has never been so good in an X-Men film like here, every single actor in this film gives a top-notch performance, with James McAvoy being the stand-out. Jennifer Lawrence is also fantastic here, and it was good seeing her as the character blue Mystique rather than Jennifer we see in the first one. It is difficult to say who the main villain of this film is, as there is many to choose from, but Magneto does a great job.<br/><br/>Quicksilver is in this movie, and despite his limited screen-time, he gives the best scene in the film. The action is also very good as well, with no shaky cam, and no serious fast cuts. <br/><br/>This is the best X-Men film so far, and a perfect superhero movie.<br/><br/>9.6/10"
"smackdrooble","10","2","3","16 March 2015"," Awesome even with it's flaws
","As far as stories go, this x-men installment is awesome. It juggles a lot of story lines, using humor and action to keep the viewers attention. As a big X-Men fan, this is probably the best of all the movies so far. Since this is a sequel, we have to look at the storyline that's been created; as the movie begins the current movie line looks like this: First Class -> X-Men -> X2 -> X3 -> Days of Future's Past. When the plot gets further in, Wolverine gets put back to approximately a year after the conclusion of First Class. As we move through the story, we find several humorous coincidences: Magneto killed JFK (magic bullet theory), Nixon tapes were caused by mutant discussions, Washington Senators ended their baseball franchise due to the destruction of the stadium. By the end of the movie, we're starting to see the turn in what the X-Men stand for; originally, X-Men were created as protectors for mutants against the humans, then there was a shift (where we leave off at the end of the movie) where they become the protectors against for humans against other mutants, thus establishing their true cause. <br/><br/>So let's get to some of the issues that arise. First, Kitty Pryde never showed time traveling abilities, which presumably would be a part of someone with mind-control/manipulation powers, which are far off from her ability to go through walls. Second, Bishop in the original comics was a big part of the time traveling plot lines, and he was next to nothing in this movie which unfortunately was a large waste of a character. Third, sending Wolverine back makes sense due to his healing abilities, but the time frame is all wrong. Don't send him to a year after First Class finishes, send him to that point in the bar when Prof X and Magneto come to see him. The entire movie would have been avoided if they had did that (admittedly, not a very exciting plot, although it would have been interesting to see First Class play out having done that, so essentially Days of Future's Past would have been First Class Take 2). Fourth, Quick Silver is by and large one of the best mutants in the series. His abilities basically allow him to get by all securities, move at a speed that allows him to physically manipulate anyone and essentially be unstoppable. If he is this powerful and the plot to capture Raven is of the highest priority, why wouldn't they take him to Paris? He just got Magneto from the Pentagon, I'm fairly certain he could have gotten Raven out of the conference room without all of this mess. Lastly, Prof X has the ability the ability to take control of the mind of others and Mystique can turn into anyone...why wouldn't you turn into Trask (or take over his mind) and just shut everything down and order everything to be destroyed? For Prof X, not having his abilities at the beginning would be a problem but he gains his full powers towards the end.<br/><br/>Every story is going to have flaws, especially Marvel movies simply because the comics themselves had so many flaws. As far as movies go, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. The plot line was right on, the ability to have the older cast merge with the new cast was extremely impressive. The best part is that the conclusion of the movie erases the events of X2 and X3. You could even make the argument that X-Men would have been erased to the point where plot changes would have to be made, i.e. with a new sense of appreciation for mutants, Senator Kelly wouldn't have attempted to start mutant registration (although that could change in the proceeding 30 years from Days of Futures Past conclusion to X-Men). No longer a threat to humanity, Rogue chooses to go to the school instead of running away because running away would have never happened, which would mean that Wolverine finds his own path to the school.<br/><br/>The part that leaves me wondering is the mid-credit scene. Now a constant in mainstream movies that have additional sequels happening, the mid-credit scene depicts the mutant Apocalypse moving around pyramids. This begs several questions: a) When is the clip taking place? It can't be modern era, but it doesn't look like the 70s either. B) The cast list currently shows for Fassbender and McKellen as Magneto, so is this another time-altering event? Lastly, with the present day conclusion of Days of Future's Past showing the peace (the school is in tact, mutants not hiding for their lives, Rogue still at the school meaning she never gave up her powers, Jean Gray still herself) If this clip takes place in the past, the resolution must be over and everyone is at peace. If the clip is in the present, why are the current mutants unable to take care of the problem, thus never involving the younger cast?<br/><br/>A lot of flaws, a lot of unanswered questions, but all in all, a great movie that I enjoy watching multiple times!"
"drqshadow-reviews","5","2","3","5 January 2015"," Glitzy Special Effects, Waves of Star Power and a Beloved Source Can't Compensate For a Murky, Dated Screenplay
","Wolverine gallops through time and space to deflect an ugly outcome for all of humanity, pausing frequently to give old cast members the time to wink directly into the camera and strut off set. I'm somewhat ashamed to admit I thought it was a rather large mess. The story had a lot of potential, especially in the unusual settings of both timelines, but it somewhat predictably gets tangled in the tripwires often associated with a time travel flick and spends far too much time delivering fan service when it should've been examining character motivations and further world-building. Trask and his sentinels barely play a supporting role in the proceedings, patsies at best, and I'm still struggling to comprehend Magneto's decision-making in the third act. It retains all of the unease-inspiring puns and goofball moments that I'd hoped the series could shed, making it feel dated and slightly pandering... a significant backtrack from the progress made in First Class. Even the built-in fireworks of the two heavyweight casts meeting face-to-face doesn't really work as well as it should. Seeing the new guys (McAvoy and Fassbender) alongside the old guard (Stewart and McKellen) didn't result in a torch-passing or spotlight the nuanced efforts that had so delighted me in the previous picture, it just made me yearn to see more of the senior guard. I mean, it's not all bad - the effects work is wonderful, it's a lot of fun spotting all the little love notes scattered about for hardcore fans, and the action roars along for a two-hour candyland cruise - but I had trouble shutting off my brain when earlier chapters hadn't been nearly so demanding in that department."

","I think the X-Men movies had a good run and now it seems it should just end. It was choppy, it was dark. And unless you really follow the X-Men in both the movies and comic books, this movie will leave you confused. I watched the movies and I was still confused. When it comes to time travel, it just opens a tall bottle of questions. Of course Magneto is back as the bad guy. That adds to my angst. Did the X-Men have no other villains? Just like the Batman franchise, always the Joker. Just like the Spiderman franchise, always the Green Goblin. So why wasn't I surprised. Nothing in this movie stood out to me. No one character grabbed my attention. Though it was refreshing to see Kitty Pryde / Shadowcat finally getting air time and not all Halle ""lookit me lookit me"" Berry. So again, Redbox saved the day. Only $1.27 to rent it. Not $12 at the theater and definitely not $20 for DVD or $30 for Blu Ray. I gave the movie a generous 5 in case it was me and I missed or misunderstood vital info in the other X-Men / Wolverine movies that lead to this movie."

","When it was announced that Bryan Singer was returning to the Director's Chair for ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" fanboys and girls everywhere squealed in excitement. Finally, the series was going back into the hands of the man who helped start the whole film franchise. I, on the other hand, groaned and wondered why ""First Class"" helmsman Matthew Vaughn couldn't return to push the story further. It was my favorite entry in the series and took the bad taste out of my mouth created by the mess referred to as ""The Last Stand.""<br/><br/>In the distant future, robots known as Sentinels have all but wiped out both mutants and humans. Wolverine is sent by the X-Men to prevent an event which will send history down this path to destruction. First he has to find a way to unite Professor X and Magneto in a search for the harbinger of doom - Mystique.<br/><br/>My worries over Singer's return to steer the franchise were all realized after the first hour or so of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past."" The first portion of the film moves ahead and sets the viewer up for a powerful and epic thrill ride. Unfortunately, like most of the director's movies, it starts to meander and get tedious right after the halfway mark. The action and excitement gets bogged down in a lot of dramatic narrative which feels as if it was injected into the script to make the movie more analytical than it really needed to be.<br/><br/>One thing I was pleasantly surprised by was the way the massive amount of cast members and the parts they played in the story were handled. I was concerned when it was announced that the original and new actors who portrayed their respective characters were going to be jammed into one movie. How in the world were filmmakers going to keep the movie from becoming overcrowded and derailing? <br/><br/>Director Singer and Screenwriter Simon Kinberg handled the whole affair quite well. Instead of trying to cram as much of a pleasurable thing down our throats as they could, they worked towards the greater good of the whole. They didn't play favorites and shove certain popular actors into scenes just to give them more face time.<br/><br/>""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is rated PG-13for sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action, some suggestive material, nudity, and language. I've seen Hugh Jackman's butt enough now. Does it really have to be showcased in every one of these films?<br/><br/>Although I did enjoy ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" to a certain degree, I felt myself getting lethargic as it moved along towards its inevitable climax. By no means is it a bad movie, but I think it could've been better under Matthew Vaughn's direction. I do give it props for fully embracing its science fiction roots."

"ArchonCinemaReviews","8","2","3","20 August 2014"," Seventh installment a success!
","Marvel brings the seventh X-Men installment and second prequel in the series with X-Men Days of Future Past.<br/><br/>It is a very fitting title, reuniting with director Bryan Singer who did the first ever X-Men film, and with Singer brings a connected and comprehensible plot consistent with the rest of the X-Men franchise.<br/><br/>It is nearing the hopeless end of the mutant war in present time and humanity is frantic, at a critical and pivotal point, at the start of X-Men Days of Future Past. The remaining X-Men send Wolverine back in time to right the wrong of the past that set the course for this destructive terminus.<br/><br/>What follows is a suspenseful, powerful and action-packed flick that is sure to please fans. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine has always been the anchor to the film franchise and it is befitting that he is the hopeful savior in Days of Future Past and a welcoming addition. All other actors, most of them playing roles portrayed by other actors, inhabit their roles successfully. Jennifer Lawrence is the most awkward of all, especially depicting Mystique's cold malice but brought out the humanity of Raven nicely.<br/><br/>The story that follows is flawless and perfectly incorporated into the X-Men's universe, fitting seamlessly into currently known history of its characters as already presented in film. To that I owe Jane Goldman, the story writer, and Simon Kinberg, the screenplay writer, distinction. At first I was a bit confused whether I was to be concerned and emotionally invested but within fifteen minutes everything became clear. The story is surprisingly uncomplicated despite having time-travel as a core subject and has a well formed grasp on its direction.<br/><br/>With any X-Men film there are bound to be action sequences and they are particularly spellbinding in X-Men Days of Future Past. They harnessed the mutant characters' abilities to accentuate the battles instead of exploiting them for the typical detracting 'wow' factor effect. I found them especially believable and well choreographed.<br/><br/>Audiences love X-Men films because at their core they are about unjust persecution for being different. We all like to think we are unique and looming is the sense that eventually it could be us on the wrong side of discrimination. The sentiment of X-Men Days of Future Past reflects this theme most evidently of all the films and should be a hit with audiences.<br/><br/>More reviews of recently released films can be found at our website!"

","Since the first X-Men movie began over 14 years ago, the entire X-Men franchise has exploded into a huge success. The original X-Men (2000) movie with the original cast of Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, etc. was great because it was one of the first Marvel movies to be shot in real life and the special effects were amazing. It was pretty much the start of a new era of superhero films.. Fast forward a decade after the first movie, you've now got a new series starring James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as the two main characters.<br/><br/>What fascinated me about this movie was the fact that Bryan Singer returned and was able to mesh up the old with the new in such an interesting way that makes the movie work. It's very rare nowadays to keep actors on for sequels...but to keep the original cast from 14 years ago to play the older counterparts of the main characters from First-Class was a marvel in itself. Now you've got the best of both worlds, and it does not disappoint!<br/><br/>I thought that this movie was amazing. As many reviewers have said, it touches on a lot of themes, some of which include discrimination, adaptation, hope, and preservation. Most importantly, it focuses on the idea of change and how one person can make a difference in the world. But also how teamwork and the forces around you can drive you to do the things you end up doing.<br/><br/>Overall, the storyline was good, the themes stood out very clearly, and to top it all off, the entire movie was action-packed and highly entertaining. I'd recommend watching it if you haven't, as it's a movie suitable for everyone, even if you're not a superhero junkie!"

","The X-men films have been hit or miss but X-men Days of Future's Past hits it out of the park. Nearly everything works in this film from the superb direction to the complexity of the characters. One aspect that works in the films favor is that there are plenty of mutants and they are all utilized well. One in particular steals the show and one scene encapsulates this proclamation. The usual suspects return of course both young and old and that's what really works in this film. Now seeing them back to back the younger versions truly resemble the older counterparts in terms of personality. It was great to see James Mcavoy and Michael Fassbender reprise their roles as Magneto and Charles Xavier. Their rapport is truly astounding , I just wish there were more scenes with them. Too much attention was focused on Wolverine. Another issue with the film is the Trask character. He is just too dull to carry a movie. However the action is first rate and the film is a complete X-men movie. Overall this film is great, while being slightly below ""First Class"" it still belongs on the mantle along with the other superb Marvel Films."
"bkbirge","7","2","3","24 June 2014"," Surprisingly good
","Surprisingly good! If you've seen many of the recent crop of super-hero sci-fi schlock that's been released then you'll understand why this is a surprise.<br/><br/>The premise is that Wolverine is sent back in time to prevent the horrible Terminator style future all the mutants are experiencing. There is plenty of eye candy CGI and explosions and all the usual suspects make cameos. In that way it's similar to other offerings but this one, unlike those, has an engaging story. True there is probably nothing earth shatteringly new here but the deft handling keeps it from ever feeling like a paint by numbers tent-pole.<br/><br/>Wolverine doesn't do much Wolverine, he's mainly used as a POV character for us to bridge the past and the future. Peter Dinklage plays the gov't villain and while I always love seeing him on screen his character seems underutilized. Hugh Jackman carries the movie in terms of character and acting chops though the cast in general was very well chosen, there are just so many of them we only get a little bit of time with each. Young Xavier and Magneto reprise their roles from the previous movie and Mystique looks better than ever and we actually get a bit of character development from her. Giamatti has a great scene chewing couple scenes that are far too short, I can only hope he and Dinklage will be used more in future movies. It would be awesome to see a spectacle genre movie that also let some of these great actors loose.<br/><br/>The world building holds together very well, not as many obvious anachronisms. I didn't feel the effort to hold suspension of disbelief like I have in other recent genre flicks. Special mention for the scenes with Quicksilver showing off his powers, those were particularly effective.<br/><br/>If they can keep this quality up for the future offerings then I will be going for sure. Highly recommended for fans of the genre."
"jokerswild1","9","2","3","20 June 2014"," X-Cellent
","This movie elevates the whole series by both being a great film on its own and by brilliantly tying all the films closer together, paying homage to them, building on the events that have taken place, and giving us the answers to several questions that have been building up as the series went on. With a great cast and characters, a clever screenplay, and impressive direction, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the best film in the series yet.<br/><br/>Film series generally put an emphasis on one character above the rest, and for the X-Men series this character was Wolverine. Having two solo spin-offs about him and having been the main character of all the films except First Class, Wolverine is still a main character, but part of what now truly feels like an ensemble: Wolverine, Mystique, Professor X, and Magneto all have equal focus in this movie. I don't fault the previous X-Men films for not being an ensemble of the same level, as it's perfectly normal to have a primary focus on one character in particular and most of the movies did have great casts, but I do feel Days of Future Past makes the best use of its cast yet.<br/><br/>We get to see quite a few familiar faces, such as Storm, Kitty Pryde, Iceman, and Colossus in the future, and Beast, Havok, and Toad in the past. Some are major supporting roles and others are mere cameos, but it's nice to see these characters again and to see most of the cast members reprise their roles. There are also several new characters. Like the returning ones, some aren't as prevalent as others, but all are distinct and stand out in their own way.<br/><br/>The amount of continuity errors in the X-Men series continued to increase as it went on, and this film manages to correct most of them. We now know why Xavier was able to walk at times after his paralyzation and why Beast looked like a normal person in X2, and the change of the series' timeline provides future opportunity to fix most of the remaining errors, as the events have all been changed now. This change in the timeline doesn't mean that the events of the previous films of the series no longer matter, as they directly lead to the story of Days of Future Past and are still remembered by Wolverine. Days of Future Past pays homage to every X-Men film, and all remain important to the series as it continues."
"ericrnolan","8","2","3","16 June 2014"," Just a few quick thoughts about ""X-Men: Days of Future Past.""
","And, no, that is not a lame attempt at a ""Quicksilver"" pun. Honestly.<br/><br/>I really, really liked it. It isn't my favorite ""X-Men"" movie — those will always be what is arguably the darkest of the franchise (""X2: X-Men United"") and the lightest (""X-Men: First Class""). But it's definitely a nice addition to the series.<br/><br/>Here are a few reactions, with minimal spoilers, in no particular order:<br/><br/>-- What a radical shift in tone from ""First Class."" Way to bring the pathos, Bryan Singer. The opening scenes are brutal, and there are many major character deaths. Some of them occur off screen; others do not. Some are violent. I do believe this is the first superhero movie I have ever seen in which a major character and fan favorite has his or her head crushed, in close-up, during the opening action set piece.<br/><br/>Speaking of the opening segment, will somebody please validate my uber- nerd-dom and tell me that they saw what I saw?! I KNEW that the overflying airships that are dropping The Sentinels looked familiar. Am I nuts, or are those none other than facsimiles of the lone ""Valhalla"" airship depicted in the woefully under-appreciated ""Marvel 2099″ universe from the mid-1990′s?! If Singer intended that, it's a terrificly obscure and fun shout-out to 40-year-old comic book fans. (Ahem.)<br/><br/>There isn't any unnecessary exposition to bore us. This is a major issue in comic book movies. We can forgive the Christopher Nolan films for revisiting Bruce Wayne's metamorphosis, because those films were exceptionally well made. The new Spider-Man films? Not so much. In ""Future Past,"" we have thankfully no flashbacks for every single character. We're briefly told that there is a global pogrom waged by The Sentinels against mutants and innocent humans, and that Xavier and Magneto have joined forces to fight the good fight. Then we're shown various heroes with various superpowers fighting. We don't need to know all of their backstories.<br/><br/>The action scenes were very well directed. Nice work, Mr. Singer. The special effects were top notch. What great fun it was seeing Blink, Iceman, Quicksilver and Bishop do their thing.<br/><br/>Given the movie's central plot device why on earth are we concerned with Mystique, and not Rogue, given their respective powers? There are a few obvious guesses One, Mystique is a more popular character. Two, Jennifer Lawrence has more star power than Anna Paquin. Still, this bugged me throughout the film.<br/><br/>I personally hate the plot device itself, in which various characters can steal or borrow others' powers.<br/><br/>Time travel is also a frequently unwieldy plot device, but I think it was capably handled here, thanks to careful writing and a little restraint.<br/><br/>It would also be just great if somebody could explain to me how Mystique apparently alters her body mass.<br/><br/>I love how this movie and ""First Class"" integrate the comic book mythology with real world events. It's pure fun, especially the nod at JFK.<br/><br/>Once again, we have an ""X-Men"" movie in which the darker characters are less predictable and more fun to follow. A better adjusted and more grounded Wolverine makes perfect sense. (We don't need to endlessly revisit the same character arc.) But he actually is less interesting when he becomes more stable. And characters like Beast are flat out boring. I'm happy that we spent a nice amount of time with Magneto, Mystique, and the human antagonists.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, Peter Dinklage was perfect as Bolivar Trask. What a performance — especially with respect to making weighty dialogue sound natural — look again at his reaction to the suggestion that he hates mutants. Incredibly good line work. Is this the same guy as in ""Games of Thrones?"" I refuse to watch that show simply because I am tired of hearing about it. But the ""X-Men"" movies seem to do a great job providing us with human adversaries that are threatening despite an absence of super-powers.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender is simply a wonderful actor, and he is perfectly cast as Youngneto. He vocalizes and emotes just like a raging, charismatic ideologue.<br/><br/>If I said that Patrick Stewart's and Ian McKellan were fantastic, that would just be belaboring the obvious.<br/><br/>I like Jennifer Lawrence. I do. She was great as a strong, sympathetic protagonist in ""The Hunger Games."" And she deserves her fanbase. But here, she just doesn't demonstrate range enough to play a vengeful, homicidal woman. Rebecca Romjin did a better job of giving us a good, scary, bogeyman to make us think that humans needed protection by Xavier's kids. Or, for an amazing example of a young actress portraying anger and vengeance, look no further than co-star Ellen Page's amazing performance in the brutal, incredible movie, ""Hard Candy"" (2005). Furthermore, Mystique, as written here and in ""First Class,"" just isn't as much fun. No, she wasn't really an identifiable character in the previous movies, but she was a great bad guy — something that a doe- eyed, redeemed Mystique just isn't.<br/><br/>Quicksilver steals the show. Evan Peters was awesome. Unsupervised teenagers with superpowers are always fun. This movie takes a lighter look at what transpired in the extremely enjoyable ""Chronicle"" (2012). What would happen if this kid met those kids?<br/><br/>It's rather nice seeing how this movie placates fan complaints with ""X- Men 3: The Last Stand.""<br/><br/>If you're the kind of flick nut who enjoys movie marathons, good luck figuring out where this film fits chronologically with the other movies! :-D<br/><br/>http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/just-a-few-quick- thoughts-about-x-men-days-of-future-past/"
"alindsay-al","10","2","3","29 May 2014"," The ultimate X-Men film that rivals being the greatest comic book film ever
","I am a huge X-Men fan but I can accept there have been some bad films in the franchise which is why this film was completely necessary and is easily the best X-Men film ever made and one of the greatest comic book films ever made. The story sees the X- Men fighting a war against the sentinels in the future so to stop the war from ever happening old magneto and professor Xavier send wolverine back to 1973 to meet their younger versions and convince them to help stop mystique from causing the war. Now some people were complaining about Hugh jackman leading this film but this is easily my favourite of his performances as wolverine and I want him to stay at it for many more years. The supporting cast is also excellent with Jennifer Lawrence stepping up and assuming the real role of mystique. She is the moral centre of the film as you can see she is properly conflicted and you understand why and feel sympathy for her character. James mcavoy and Michael fassbender return as the young Xavier and magneto and they kill it, they make the characters really interesting and dynamic with their chemistry totally owning this film. Patrick Stewart and Ian mckellen are back as the older versions of the characters and their relationship is slightly different in this film and their chemistry also is great. Peter dinklage is great as trask, Nicholas hoult is great as beast and Evan Peters is awesome as quicksilver which was a great surprise. Time travel stories can sometimes be convoluted and messy but with the return of Bryan singer I think this film did it perfectly. The transition of the future and past really works and makes you care about all the characters in both time periods. I also really liked everybody's individual journeys in this film and I think some of them aren't over and will continue in apocalypse. The script is great with the best mix of drama and comedy I have ever seen in a comic book film and that has to be truly commended. The style is great with the future scenes really working and the tone of it being perfect for the situation. Also the 1970s scenes style works too and makes you feel the period and also feel engrossed in the story. Overall this is the best X-Men film ever and one of the best films of 2014"
"zivkovic-zorana","10","2","3","28 May 2014"," Amazing movie :)
","One of the best movies i've seen really! I like it better when all mutants are together and this movie had good story, Logan of course as one of the strongest characters and we got to see some characters that actually died. A good sense of humor made it quite interesting, good acting and good actors made it a great quality movie. This different time- lines thing worked out great all the while you could connect characters from the past with the ones seen in previous movies. Quicksilver was really amusing, especially when they broke into Pentagon. I'm always happy to see any Marvel comic adaptation movie and this one blown my mind, thank you X-men!"

","Spoiler-free review!<br/><br/>After Brett Ratner's unforgivably ""meh"" X-Men: The Last Stand, mutant rights when down the toilet, and the government unleashed their most powerful and flashiest weapons yet — The Sentinels.<br/><br/>These fan-favourite enemies are giant robots — though here they're more medium-rare robots — who have all but destroyed mutant kind and almost the entire world with them.<br/><br/>Professor Patrick Stewart hatches a plan to employ Kitty Pryde's time-phasing power and send Wolverine back in time. He embarks on a mission to prevent the initial development of the Sentinels from ever happening.<br/><br/>This lands us in 1973, the only place Wolverine was ever fashionable. He must reunite the cast of X-Men First Class, convince them that he's not a crazy steroid junkie, and change destiny.<br/><br/>As you may have seen by the ten stars above, I was insurmountably impressed by this film. As someone who grew up with the excellent X-Men 1 and 2, then crying at number 3, then shrugging my shoulders at the adequacy of the rest of them, I am glad to say that X-Men movies are at last really, really good again.<br/><br/>This film delivers enjoyment for both fans of the original film series and the (sort of) First Class reboot. While the film primarily takes place in the past, with the young un's, the original cast are utilized wonderfully in their awesome post-apocalypse future. (Pun!) <br/><br/>In a sea of drearily plotted and overly flashy superhero movies, this film displays a surprisingly intelligent plot line, incorporating elements from over half a dozen previous films in a way that will delight old and new fans.<br/><br/>Some initial worries of mine were the executive mandated appearances of Quicksilver and a larger Mystique. (not a comment on Jennifer Lawrence's weight) However the film takes these plot points and utilizes them to the greatest effect. Quicksilver is brilliant, his hair is brilliant, and Mystique's role within the film fees natural and provides great drama and character struggle.<br/><br/>I have only small criticisms, mostly directed at the film's technical aspects. There's an unfortunate overuse of slow-mo, which is effective for the sequences of Quicksilver, but otherwise very annoying and it gives me horrid memories of The Amazing Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is a superb experience and I highly recommend to everyone. There is great action which serves the plot, top-notch acting from old and new, and even a surprise ending which will usher the tears from fanboys everywhere.<br/><br/>Go watch it."
"pootc","9","2","3","27 May 2014"," This is why we go to the movies
","X-Men Days of Future Past is an epic, and emotional adventure filmed with drama and with memorable performances all around, and from so many characters too. When hearing about the scope of the plot I was a little hesitant, because the introduction of mutant after mutant didn't work so well in cases such as X-Men 3: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine which were jam-packed with action but little to no character development or weight behind it, it felt rushed and artificial.<br/><br/>But the returning director of X-Men and X2, Bryan Singer doesn't overdo it at all. The characters all have a role to play with the leads going to Wolverine (Jackman) and Xavier (McAvoy). This is not an action movie by any means. But when there is action it's really heavy just like the drama - everything in this movie is heavy and epic. The end of the world, both mutant and humankind is what's at stake here and the future is a horrible, horrible nightmare that could very well become reality if a grief-stricken, young Professor Xavier cannot find hope and pull himself together in time.<br/><br/>Xavier having to find himself, with the help of his older-self (Stewart) as seen in the trailers was a touch of brilliance. An epic scene which sent chills up my body. This is why we go to the movies for this kind of roller-coaster experience. <br/><br/>10/10"

","The best movie in the X-men movie franchise by a distance. Keeps you completely engrossed from the start till the very end (Pity me I missed out on the post credits scene). Dark future, not-so-perfect past with a ray of hope, a shining light in between the two zones. What a concept!<br/><br/>Superb direction by Bryan Singer who returns to the franchise and starts delivering from the 1st frame itself. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine/Logan is a treat to watch any day. He is completely owned this character and as always been cheesy here and there, which is actually fun to watch. Jennifer Lawrence excels as Mystique/Raven. This girl knows how to play a part in a movie and not get overshadowed by bigger stars. The most exciting part of the movie was actually watching the younger Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto/Erik played by James Mcavoy and Michael Fassbender respectively who are strikingly different in character from their present selves. Not to miss the breath-taking stunts by supporting mutants like Beast, Quicksilver, Blink and Shadowcat.<br/><br/>Action sequences are amazing, and will leave you in awe (i was literally screaming WOW). The script has been improved and flaws removed from the previous editions. Everything is near perfect. Marvel studios deliver another marvelous flick. Not to be missed as a movie on a whole, and not a scene to be missed. In short, this part does what other parts couldn't. And yeah, don't forget the post credits scene. Poor me!"
"pkyink-11-153257","7","2","3","26 May 2014"," So much wasted potential....
","I had been looking forward to this movie for a long time. The previews made it look so epic and it turned out just so so. I personally think First Class was superior. I know a lot of people are bashing Brian Singer just to bash him but the man ruined Night Crawler and I really don't think he should have been a part of the film and I would have preferred it if they had just pretended like the earlier Xmen films never happened and completely started over. They could've still used Patrick Stewart and the other actors but just abandoned the story lines, which I guess they kind of did.<br/><br/>They didn't do a very good job of connecting things. There are far to many inconsistencies to list. I think what aggravates me most is how did they fail to tie in the post credits scene to The Wolverine with it? I can understand having trouble with movies released almost a decade before they knew they would need to tie things together, but not with a movie as recent as Wolverine. They seriously made James Mangold drop Wolverine receiving his mask and gloves so they could include a scene that doesn't even make sense.<br/><br/>I wanted to see Wolverine take out one of the Sentinels but they made it impossible.<br/><br/>I like Jennifer Lawrence but she shouldn't have been the focus.<br/><br/>Magneto gaining complete control of the Sentinels was just stupid. At most the railroad tracks he inserted would have simply given him control of their movement.<br/><br/>How is Xmen Apocalypse going to take place in the 1980's if DOFP ended in the future? <br/><br/>I better see Rogue fly in the next one. Hopefully with True Blood being done Anna Paquin will get more screen time."
"John K.-2","8","2","3","24 May 2014"," Nothing really new, but a worthy addition to the X-Men canon
","The strength of X-Men films has always been to give a large number of characters a decent bit of the story, and to allow viewers to imagine what it would be like to have that particular power. The moral of X-Men films has always been the same: people who are genetically different have to learn to live in peace. This film is absolutely solid on both of these aspects, along with occasional self-referential humour. <br/><br/>However, it doesn't bring anything outstanding beyond the above. It's set partly in the 1970s, and goes out of its way to include odd stuff from the seventies (let's face it, there was plenty); it charts more of the characters' personal development; it performs the necessary reboot that major franchises seem to require these days; and it has plenty of high-tech special effects. All perfectly competent (apart from one 'revelation' concerning a well-known three-letter acronym that nearly made me laugh out loud), and yet I walked away feeling I'd seen most of it before, in one form or another.<br/><br/>See it of you're a fan of the franchise and want to watch the story progress.

Like all the Marvel movies, this one is over-the-top. If you think you can explain the plot well enough to make FUTURE PAST seem internally consistent to someone else, you're spending Waaaaay too much time in the Marvel Universe. However, just as Grandpa or Great-Grandpa expected eye-popping set pieces from the James Bond films of the 1960s and the 1970s, that's what America's Future demands of Marvel movies today, and FUTURE PAST does NOT disappoint.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","3","24 May 2014"," It's dazzling, but don't look too close
","X-Men: Days of Future Past is like the world's most dazzling wedding cake. It's so pretty, and even breathtaking, that it is easy to lose sight of the fact that what's on the inside is not nearly as impressive as what's on the outside. It colorful, it's fun, but don't look too deeply or you'll begin to find cracks in its impressive facade.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean it's not entertaining. You definitely get your money's worth, but story-wise it isn't going to rank with the best of the recent flood of comic book movies. After the great urgency of Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the lovely intimate love story of The Amazing Spiderman 2, this new X-Men movie feels a little stiff in the story department. It is not, however, stiff in it's ambitions. The X-Men series has always been willing to try something new. Thus far, they've tried one-offs, and prequels, and now they're throwing time travel into the mix.<br/><br/>The story a lot more complicated than it needs to be. It is based on a 1981 X-Men comic book written by Chris Clairmont and John Byrne that begins in the future when the war between the mutants and an army of Government Sanctioned Shape-changing Giant Killer Robots (say that out loud) has devastated the face of the Earth and driven the few surviving mutant into hiding.<br/><br/>Among the surviving few are Charles Xavier/Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his best frenemy Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) who have gathered the surviving few mutants into hiding to figure out what to do about this situation. Since Kitty Pride (a woefully underused Ellen Page) has the power to mentally sent people through time, Prof gets the brilliant idea to send Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to the 1970s to stop the Government Sanctioned Shape-Changing Giant Killer Robots from ever being developed. *Some spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>Logan has some to-do list: 1.) Stop the Government Sanctioned Shape-Changing Giant Killer Robots from being built by the government. 2.) Stop Raven Darkhölme/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing the evil Boliver Trask (Peter Dinkledge) who invented the Government Sanctioned Shape-Changing Giant Killer Robots. 3.) Enlist the help of young Charles Xavier, who has apparently tuned in, turned on, and dropped out. 4.) Locate and retrieve young Magneto who's prison cell is, let's put it this way, not exactly your standard county lock-up.<br/><br/>With all of these balls in the air, you can imagine that X-Men: Days of Future Past is one busy little bee, and it is. Director Bryan Singer returns to this series after directing the first two X-Movies (there have now been seven, count 'em, seven), and what he brings with him is a bold spirit of fun. There are set pieces here, especially Magneto's prison break, that are well executed, as are the references to the world of the 1970s, everything from lava lamps to Robert Flack to ""Sanford and Son"" to Pink Floyd.<br/><br/>Yet, what the movie lacks is a tightly-written story. The third act, which is impressive on a technical scale, is kind of a disappointment story-wise. Singer's real creativity should be in showing us how past events are effecting the future. Instead, the third act is given over to one of those crash and bash endings that you could see in any big-budget special effects movie. The best time travel movies are always a dizzy display of the past connecting with the future.<br/><br/>He's also lacking a timely theme. This first two X-Men movies – which he directed – very effectively dealt with the current issue of acceptance of those that society deems ""freaks."" It was a nice parallel to the current issue of gay rights. Here he's made a much more standard adventure. He has indeed made a special effects wedding cake, one that after a while leaves you craving some meat."

X-Men: Days OF Future Past was quite incredible! can't think of a lot to say that is negative, but I will try. Maybe. Probably not.<br/><br/>-Story was great. There were a few little things that did not make sense, but they did not matter that much. Also Bryan Singer pulled off making Brett Ratner never happen. Yup!! -Pace was a little slower, and the tone was darker, but they really had to be. It also had an overarching theme of hope which was great.<br/><br/>-Cast did great! Everyone was at their best. Peter Dinklage was a great Bolivar Trask! Also James McAvoy is now Professor X the way Martin Freeman is not Bilbo. Yeah everyone was very good.<br/><br/>-Music was pretty good. It features some moments that highlight some of the other X-Men scores, which is great! -CG was good. Cinematography and look and everything else was good too.<br/><br/>-Content: Pushed its PG-13 rating. Some moderate language with one F-word and some brief partial nudity. Which I expected both of in this based on the other X-Men films.<br/><br/>-So, X-Men: Days Of Future Past rocked! I loved seeing the combo of X-Men and X2 with First Class, which are the three I actually liked. I really like that there are going to be more films too! By the way, stay through the credits.<br/><br/>-I will sat X-Men: Days Of Future Past deserves a high 8.5. Which means I had to decide if I liked it more than Captain America, which a just barely do. IDK if I like it more than Grand Budapest though. I'll get back to you on that.<br/><br/>-So if you like he X-Men series or Marvel movies, you will love this film! Go see it."
"bridg-x","8","2","3","24 May 2014"," A continuously improving franchise
","This installment by far better then the original three x-men movies with the new cast complimenting the old to make this movie work. This time travel story definitely makes up for and erases the disappointing X-men: The Last Stand while highlighting favorite moments of the past installments. However it seems that the events that took place in Last Stand did not affect this movie as Charles is alive and Magneto and Mystique have not lost their powers, in my opinion a good thing to forget. The opening action sequence is a great display of the older cast and their mutant powers. James McAvoy as the younger Charles along with Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Holt give amazing performances in their younger roles. Evan Peters performance as Quicksilver was rather funny and a very enjoyable sequence, hopefully we will see his character with the young X-men in Apocalypse. Like the Avengers, a seemingly impossible movie on paper, the huge cast and varied numbered of leading characters is excellently executed. My one critique would be Michael Fassbender's young magneto. Though Fassbender is a brilliant actor and his performance in First Class was perfection, the character development of young Magneto is flawed and overlooked in Days of Future Past. He went from attempting to save President JFK and mourning the loss of his fellow younger mutants to attempting to kill Wolverine, Beast, and Mystique along with attempting to publicly starting a war with the humans. Following First Class, I was expecting a lot more from young Magneto and his story in Days of Future Past was underwhelming. Another interesting plot point was Wolverines creator Stryker seeming to be compromised by Mystique at the end of the film. Does Logan end up becoming Wolverine under Stryker's experiments, we do not see in the new future whether he has his bone or metal claws. Overall this film proves that the X-men franchise is getting better and better, with the brilliant new cast to be outshining the old cast. Post credit scene making Apocalypse a very intriguing next installment."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","3","23 May 2014"," Immensely popular, deservedly
","While verdicts of many major film critics are not yet out at the time of this posting, the fact that this X-men ""convergence"" has won a resounding approval (8.9 rating) from some 17,000 IMDb users to-date is not surprising. I use the word convergence to denote the two separate time frames in which the X-men movies have appeared: the initial story set in the present (loosely defined) on the one hand, and time of the 1962 Cuban Crisis on the other when the two nemesis were young men. This convergence takes up both time frames: the continuation of the ""present"" when the mutants are facing the risk of total annihilation and the year 1973 to which Logan is sent back to try to save the day by changing the future. Sounds familiar? You've seen it all, the best of which is ""Back to the future"".<br/><br/>While the basic premise is familiar, the work done with it is clever, with good attention to details. The plot is simple and uncontrived, makes sense, and works. Don't be overwhelmed by the alarming proliferation of characters. Focus on the few key ones – the rest are almost like animation, although not in a literal sense. The new enemy, potential annihilator of the mutant species, is called Sentinels: robots developed with one single-minded agenda – identify, hunt down and kill all mutants. Sentinels were developed back in the 1970s by Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage). Ironically, the successful assassination of Trask led to the immediate capture of assassin Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), the analysis of whose genetic makeup became instrumental to the perfection of Sentinels. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Gandolfsorry, I mean Ian McKellen), joining force in the mutant's last stand, commission Kitty Pryde (lovely Ellen Page) to send Logan (whatsisname again?) back to find and persuade the pair back then (James McAvoy as Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr) to stop the assassination. If successful, this would remake history - Sentinels would never progress beyond the prototype stage and nobody would remember anything about the alternative, sinister time line. This time-travel here is a tricky concept. What is sent back is actually Logan's ""consciousness"" from the present, to sort of ""possess"" his body back in 1973. Why Logan? He is the only one who can survive the ordeal of this decades-spanning time travel, and any worthy follower of the X-men or Wolverine story knows why. Just one more thing: if this works, Logan is the only person who will remember what happened.<br/><br/>No more needs to be said about the plot. What I have not elaborated on are just details that enhance the texture of this basic plot. The two key set pieces, as can be easily surmised, are the titanic battle against the Sentinels in the present time frame and culminating assassination scene back in 1973. Towards the end of the movie, they converge and cross-cut in a totally predictable fashion.<br/><br/>I mentioned the proliferation of characters, mostly mutants, both new and old. I am only going to mention two additional ones. Nicholas Hoult as Beast gets almost as much screen time as the key characters, as the only company kept by Xavier (details omitted here). The other one is Evan Peters as Quicksilver, not so much for the character as for one specific scene with Jim Croce's all-time hall-of-fame classic ""Time in a bottle"" as background music (details omitted here). There is a lot more, old and new, all tremendous fun to watch.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of everything in it (characters, stories, situations), although none with any real depth. That it is hugely entertaining is amply demonstrated in the aforementioned IMDb user rating. To some, probably, the mere special effects are worth it."
"s_campanale","8","2","3","22 May 2014"," Back to basics for story with lots of brain and a little brawn that does a difficult juggling act well.
","There were a lot of expectations resting on this movie's shoulders. A return from original director Bryan Singer, a resurrection of the original trilogy cast and a union of original trilogy and ""First Class"". Plus it features the beloved 'Sentinels' storyline and deals with time travel (always tricky) and the often used 'go back to the past to change the future' line, as well as heavy issues about war and peace and the power of choice over destiny etc. However, happily enough, this difficult and tricky balancing act has been pulled off with aplomb.<br/><br/>The 'ravaged Earth' future (which is at odds with original trilogy but anyway..) is shamelessly derivative of 'The Terminator' and 'The Matrix' series, and they do not even try to hide it. Not so important given that it is just a bookend for the main story. Professor X and Magneto are now allies, facing an army of unstoppable anti-mutant robots called Sentinels which are like the offspring of the T1000 and Thor's Destroyer. Reduced to just a handful, it is decided to send Wolverine back to 1973 because he is the only one who can make the journey and also never ages (and because he is the main star of the series) His mission is to unite young Charles, a drug addicted wash out who is afraid of his mental powers, and young Lehnsherr, who is imprisoned beneath the Pentagon suspected of having assassinated Kennedy (?) Breaking him out with the aid of young Hank McCoy/Beast and Quicksilver, who can move at lightning speed, they have to stop Mystique, who is now a breakaway radical, from assassinating diminutive genius Bolivar Trask, inventor of the Sentinels, an act which will at once radicalise the human governments and provide Trask's team – headed by young Colonel Stryker – with her unique DNA that helps them create the T1000 like future Sentinels! After interrupting the first attempt at the Paris peace talks to end the Vietnam War (where Trask is trying to sell his Sentinels to the Reds) they then track her down to Washington where President Nixon is unveiling the first generation robots. However Magneto is following his own radical agenda and crashes the party by dropping a Stadium around the White House and hijacking the robots. With the future on a literal knife edge it will be a series of individual personal choices that decides everything.<br/><br/>There is a predictable but cute coda in a totally new future that sees a lot of dead characters alive again (guess who in particular?) and the events of the previous 5 contemporary timeline movies seemingly rubbed out to start anew.<br/><br/>The film returns to big ideas and concepts, something that defined the original trilogy but largely disappeared from subsequent entries. In many ways it evokes ""Watchman"", right down to Nixon and a cold war milieu (here Vietnam) demonstrating human aggression and self destructiveness which a well meaning but misguided scientist hopes to end by uniting mankind against a common enemy (here mutants) It also returns to the core concept of X-Men, do you meet aggression and hostility with more aggression and hostility or do you reach out and change hearts and minds? Singer shows pros and cons of both sides but of course ends on a victory for peace and mutual tolerance. It is far more thought provoking and free thinking than the simplistic black and white agitprop of the overpraised ""Captain America the Winter Soldier"". The old free will/destiny dichotomy gets a fair airing as well with a message that even the smallest of gestures and choices can change not just our own lives but those of countless others. It is no coincidence that a classic Star Trek episode is playing in the background of a key moment!<br/><br/>The film is not over abundant in action but then no previous X-Men ever was either. The ""Terminator"" future scenes are pretty much all in the trailer and seem done with little real care. There are some interesting set pieces in the 70's section, notably Quicksilver's bullet time rescue and a fight around the Paris peace talks that's caught on 8mm 'found footage'. The biggest battle comes at the end with Magneto's stadium lift and White House destruction, even if the resolution is ultimately intellectual rather than pyrotechnic.<br/><br/>Acting wise, Jackman is again the star playing a more chilled out Wolverine this time in his 6th turn! Stewart and Mckellen are cameos more than anything else , leaving the real screen time to Mcavoy and Fassbender, who here play intermediate versions of the characters. McAvoy has most to do as a self doubting pathetic druggy wreck that gets a little tiresome quickly. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique gets another expanded role, driving the story along, but her performance is laconic and lacks passion. Nicholas Hoult is a nerdy Beast who can change at will while Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage plays unintended villain Trask well and never loads his character or reaches for camp. Other brief returnees from the original trilogy include Ellen Page, Aaron Stanford, Shawn Ashmore and Halle Berry, though like the big two they're just there for recognition value and do little.<br/><br/>Perhaps a little action-light for some fans and a seeming step back from the reboot project, this film is nonetheless an engrossing and unusual left turn for the series that leaves us wanting to know more as the credits roll."

","This one of my most favourite superhero movies ever. I loved that this film brought the original cast and knew cast together. The performance are great, it's fun and there are great character interactions. There is some great action and the plot is great. I liked Mystique in this much more then in the previous film. The villain is ok but doesn't have much motivation to be doing what he is doing. Overall a fantastic movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>9.4/10"

","X-Men: Days of Future Past just blew my mind. It is amazing. I'm glad to have Bryan Singer on this franchise again, he made a great job obviously. Cast, characters, storytelling, action, editing, charisma, tempo... All of them are awesome. There are just so little few thing that I didn't like but they don't matter much. Also, final sequence was amazing too. No doubt, this film is the best one of X-Men movies."
"theredbird-2","10","1","1","5 July 2019"," Best movie in the franchise
","X-men had introduced the franchise. X-men 2 was a worthy sequel. But after flops like ""the last stand"" and a passable reboot like ""first class"" i'll admit i had my concerns about this movie. Hugh jackman had left the franchise to focus on other projects and the latest film didn't work as well as it's predecessors. The formula seemed to be use one character to carry the story and use the other characters to give the lead someone to work off of. Much like a lead singer and a team of back up vocalists. Despite the films claiming to be about a team, they never felt like an ensemble piece the avengers franchise has managed.<br/><br/>This film came closer than any other to being about the team. The film begins in a dystopian future 2023 where a few free mutants are running and hiding from machines called sentinels that are designed to hunt down and kill anything that doesn't present as baseline human. In a desperate gamble to undo the entire war they have been losing, they send wolverine back in time to stop the event that triggers the whole war of humans vs mutants.<br/><br/>From this point on we follow wolverine in 1973 as he attempts to re-unite a younger professor x and magneto in the past while the future 2023 team has to fight off the attacking sentinels to buy him enough time to get the job done.<br/><br/>With bryan singer returning as director, actors hugh jackman (wolverine) sir patrick stewart (professor x) and sir ian mckellan (magneto) this movie serves as a sequel to the original x-men movies and the new x-men movies by tying up the two timelines and in essence ""ret-conning"" the damage done by brett ratner's ""the last stand"". While at the same time properly helping the new cast with a proper ""passing of the torch"". Actors james mcavoy (professor x) and michael fassbender (magneto) finally get play the parts they were hired for by showing the audience their characters damaged friendship while still remaining true to their own convictions.<br/><br/>The story telling is top notch, the acting is spot on and the special effects compliment the film beautifully at every turn. This film is quite possibly the best in the franchise and leaves the audience with a sense of hope for future x-men movies"

","It's incredible how they got the two teams (past end future), being funcional without spoil anything, it's amazing see the older cast again, pretty nostalgic, and off course, finally discover what happened since the last apparition, giving us answers and still continue the storyline with the young cast, introducing new characters very interesting (Quicksilver), have so many exciting scenes, and what was the soundtrack (I loooove), it's enjoyable, it's a great adventure with the best happy ending."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Hugh Jackman movie in order, I come to Days Of Future Past<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: In 2023, The X-Men send Wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants.<br/><br/>After the more character driven (but still with action) The Wolverine, I remember being sat in the cinema, with my son, thinking this was such a step back, during the all out action/CGI fest that was the opening 10 minutes. I ended up leaving, thinking it was possibly my favourite X-Men movie.<br/><br/>Rewatching it, for only the third time today, I still had the same initial thought, and the same thought at the end.
I have to applaud this series of movies for hitting some interesting social and political hot zones. I love both versions of Charles and Eric, but I prefer Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique over Rebecca Romijn. I really enjoyed Quicksilver too. The kitchen scene in The Pentagon is a real highlight.<br/><br/>The movie also has an excellent villain in Game Of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, playing a mutant-hating arms manufacturer with an awful name Bolivar Trask. A bloody anagram of Stark, as a surname is lazy and awful.<br/><br/>X-Men: Days Of Future Past grossec $233 million at the domestic box office, to end 2014 as the 9th highest grossing movie of 2014."

","Wow. Just wow. This film really surprised me as it combines both the old cast with the new cast. The film has a good way of showing us what has happend to the world since X-men the last stand and the wolverine which came out the year before this did. The plot is the world is overrun by robots called the sentinels which were created by Boliver Trask in the 70s but before that he was killed by mystique. The X-men have spread out over the globe and stick together in order to survive. The X-men decide to send wolverine back to the 70s to stop mystique from killing Boliver Trask. But in order to stop her he needs the help of Charles Xavier in the 70s but he isn't in a wheelchair he's walking using drugs but the drugs make his powers go. Wolverine succeeds but also needs the help of magneto but he's in prison cause he accidentally made the bullet curved which killed JFK. But in order to break him out they use quicksilver to break him out. They work together and they manage to stop mystique but also reveal to the whole world that mutants exist. The movie as whole works together so well. But the best thing about it is that the previous films don't exist in the X-men universe as they are now wiped out.

"kevinthecritic","8","1","1","1 July 2018"," ""Days of Future Past"" is X-hilarating
","4.5 out of 5 stars (nearly a classic)<br/><br/>X-Men: Days of Future Past is one of the best films of the long-running X-Men franchise. It combines everything I love about the franchise: Interesting characters, good humor, and engaging action sequences, once again under the direction of Bryan Singer, the man who arguably started the public's fascination with comic book films. If you have not seen or have a general dislike of the X-Men films, then this will only confuse you. If you love the films, this one will entertain you.<br/><br/>Logan (Hugh Jackman once again proving he's the only man for the role) has joined forces with Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his once-foe Magneto (Ian McKellen) along with a rag-tag band of mutants who are fighting against the Sentinels, giant mutant-hunting robots created by Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage displaying that his small stature does not hinder his ability to intimidate).<br/><br/>The situation has escalated to the point that the mutant's only option is to send someone back to 1973 and stop the Sentinels from being created in the first place. A mutant with the ability to project people's brains back in time does so to Logan so that he can get a younger Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) to assist him with this. Once there, he discovers that it was Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence once again displaying her amazing acting talents) who unintentionally caused the present problems. Unfortunately, Charles is in a mental funk at this point, and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is still up to his old tricks. Time is of the essence, however, so Logan must accomplish his mission or risk the annihilation of the mutant population.<br/><br/>I cannot begin to describe how much this movie surprised me. The trailers made it look as if it would be one of two things: absolutely amazing, or just okay. Thankfully, it was absolutely amazing. The plot moves quickly, the characters are as engaging as ever, and all of the humor hits the mark. The story was written by Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn (Vaughn directed X-Men: First Class, which breathed new life into the series), and the two of them have that rare ability to balance humor and seriousness without there being tonal whiplash.<br/><br/>Dinklage is the perfect man to play Trask, being so intimidating that you forget his dwarfish size. He is one of the best villains I've seen in this series, the second being William Stryker in X2. The viewer can hate and understand his goals at the same time, another rarity in an action film. The real standout performance is Jennifer Lawrence, who commands the attention of the audience whenever she's onscreen. Provided she doesn't pull any Lindsay Lohans on us, Lawrence should have a long and prosperous career. McAvoy also succeeds at playing a broken man while not making his character depressing. My only complaint is that some of the actors don't get a lot to do. Halle Berry shows up as Storm in the climax, but that's about it. Hopefully, she will get more to do in the next film.<br/><br/>All in all, X-Men: Days of Future Past is a fantastic movie, mixing the five star rating by a grain of salt. It's funny, action-packed, and absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for Sequences of Intense Sci-Fi Violence and Action, Some Suggestive Material, Nudity (one humorous scene) and Language (not all that much)"
"filmtogo","9","1","1","16 June 2018"," Best of them all.
","It's clearly the best of all the X-Men films and the whole franchise including the Hugh Jackman Wolverine Stand-Alone movies and Ryan Reynolds appearances as Deadpool. This is a nearly perfect crossover of the old X-Men trilogy, the new bunch of mutants and at the same time this film deletes every mistake made by X-Men: The Last Stand. It's just sad to see that it's Wolverine who is going back in time and not Kitty Pryde. It would've been a perfect opportunity to give her a bigger role here. But it still works. Hugh Jackman has great chemistry with Michael Fassbenders Magneto and James McAvoys Charles Xavier. Also big parts for Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique (here way better than in First Class), Nicholas Hoult as Beast and a small but scene stealing moment for this incarnation of Quicksilver played by Evan Peters (and by Aaron Johnson in The Avengers: Age of Ultron). It's a fun ride. It's a time travel movie well made. It's handling a lot of characters very well. It's entertaining from start to finish."

"claveajoc","10","1","1","24 April 2018"," This is still by far the Best X-Men Movie to date and Its actually my favourite Marvel Movie!
","I was completely blown away after watching this movie. This movie was fast paced and filled with fantastic action sequences and great direction from Bryan Singer. One of the best things about this movie is the story itself, it is very well written and very interesting and it also provides some emotional scenes that motivates the characters including the audience to have hope and conquer your fears. Even though there are lots of characters in the film, They don't feel overcrowded and overstuffed and they don't feel like they are shoehorned in . A lot of these characters are well fleshed out and likable. This movie was never boring!<br/><br/>If you don't know the plot of this movie, It's about a dustopian future in 2023 where the mutants are facing extinction because they are being taking over by the sentinels (Mutant killing robots). The sentinels have already hunted down a large population of mutants and humans who are helping mutants to survive and killing them or sending them to prison. Wolverine and the X-Men has found refuge and has decided to send Wolverine back in time to 1973 to recruit the younger versions of Prof. X, Magneto and Hank Mccoy to prevent the assassination of Bolivar Trask being set by Mystique. This assassination is what started this sentinel chaos in the future 2023. Prof. X thinks that if this assassination is prevented, that means that the future is reset and all of the X-Men characters are all alive and safe and sound. This also wipes out the sentinels in existence when this assassination is prevented. <br/><br/>My favourite part of this film is Quicksilver. That quicksilver scene is one of the best and coolest scenes in a comic book movie ever! and probably my favourite scene in the movie. The Soundtrack for that scene was frickin perfect! <br/><br/>Michael Fassbender killed it as Young Magneto! He was such a bad ass in this movie! and James McAvoy was great as Young Prof. X. I thought Jennifer Lawrence did a pretty great job as Mystique. She was a bad ass in this movie.<br/><br/>There are a lot of great scenes in this movie that I will not spoil but if you watch this movie, you are going to like it! I definitely have no issues with this movie.<br/><br/>What's so great about this movie is that it's never boring. even if the action isn't there, you are still invested and interested in the story for this movie and the interaction between these characters. The Time Travelling story of this film is very interesting as well.<br/><br/>Overall it is a great comic book movie filled with awesome action scenes and emotional scenes to it and the characters are well written and fleshed out and you can actually care about them and be able to understand their motivations. The standout of this movie like I mentioned earlier is the story. It is so well written and satisfyingly epic at the same time. therefore, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the best X-Men movie ever! <br/><br/>I'm gonna give X-Men: Days of Future Past an A+"
"gavinp9","7","1","1","2 January 2018"," A good effort, but I expected more from the original comic book movie franchise
","'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is the fifth X-Men film (let's not include the Wolverine movies in this count) and does a good job of linking the original trilogy (2000-2006) to the 2011 prequel, 'X-Men: First Class'. The story starts off in the not-too-distant future (i.e. a decade or so after 'X-Men: The Last Stand'), where the Sentinels have almost hunted mutant-kind - and some of human-kind - to extinction. The plus side of this is that we get to see grown-up Professor X (Stewart), Magneto (McKellen), Wolverine (Jackman), Shadow Cat (Page), Storm (Berry), Iceman (Ashmore) & Colossus (Cudmore) - plus new additions Sunspot (Canto), Bishop (Sy), Warpath (Stewart) & Blink (Fan - who? Yeah, even I don't know who Blink is - some sort of weird mix between Nightcrawler & Psylocke) - and how they're living in the Terminator 4-esque future. The solution? Send Wolverine into the past to try to stop the Sentinels from being created. (I'm not sure how Shadow Cat's phasing ability inexplicably lets her transport people to the past...)<br/><br/>This is where - in 1973 - we're re-introduced to young Charles (McAvoy) & Eric (Fassbender). There's some good moments as they meet Wolverine for the ""first"" time, including drafting in Quicksilver (Peters). I'm glad they hinted that Magneto is his father, but it's a shame the same actor won't be playing him in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. We also meet Dr Trask (Dinklage, solid as ever), the creator of the Sentinel program and find out how Mystique (Lawrence) is out to assassinate him. I'm not sure why the films have so much focus on her, when she's not really that interesting a character in the comics and certainly not as pivotal as the films make her. Beast (Hoult) is good and I'm glad they got one of the original five X-Men in there with Xavier (no sighting of Angel at all!). It all gets slightly confusing, as the ""future"" X-Men fight off Sentinels to stop Wolverine from coming back to the future (had to be said!), while the ""past"" X-Men fight Magneto, Mystique & Sentinels separately!<br/><br/>There's some pretty massive set pieces at the end, with all the sets/costumes of the 70s looking great/realistic too (including Nixon!), but it all seemed just a little lacklustre to me. A few things don't quite add up and I had higher expectations from the future battles, as well as from the young Professor X/Magneto dynamic. It felt to me like it was building to something massive and the pay-off wasn't quite there. Sure, it's an enjoyable ending (I'm still looking forward to 'X-Men: Apocalypse') and does a good enough job of linking the films/characters, but I think Fox bit off more than they could chew. It was a little slow in parts and Wolverine certainly seemed like a passenger with not much to do. There were certainly some fun scenes and some exciting scenes, but not enough to elevate this to 'Avengers' status."

"craig-hopton","7","1","1","2 January 2017"," A good addition to the X-men franchise
","A good addition to the X-men franchise. What makes it original is the strong contrast between the future scenes featuring a final band of X-men standing up to the power-absorbing Sentinels, and the scenes from the past featuring a young Xavier and Magneto.<br/><br/>The future scenes feature some impressive special effects and earthquakingly powerful mutant-on-Sentinel battles. The opening sequence in particular is a cracker.<br/><br/>The scenes set in the past are interesting for their insights into the early years of Xavier and Magneto but don't have the same oomph. James McAvoy is a little too fragile as the young Xavier - he's not a persuasive match for Patrick Stewart and seems to be easily outclassed by the young Magneto.<br/><br/>The climax of the movie is a tad pedestrian, but taken as a whole this is worth a watch."

Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart made this film even more intriguing with their presence.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to the music composer John Ottman. The musical score of Days of Future Past was simply amazing! It not only captured each scene perfectly, but drove the film deeper into drama and deeper emotions.

","he long awaited 7th X film that merges the universes of The Wolverine, X-Men and X-Men First Class is finally here! If you know anything about the X-Men movie franchise you know it's been a hit or miss series and in my opinion there have been more misses than hits and even then, the hits aren't misstep free. Now, any other studio would have just hit the reset button, so to speak, and rebooted the franchise with whatever pieces they wanted going forward. However, hats off to the writing team of Simon Kinberg, Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn who instead undertook the truly herculean feat of not only telling the classic Days of Future Past story from the X-Men comics, but also writing a story that effectively rights all the wrongs done over the past 14 years of spotty movie making. Days of Future Past is quite possibly the best X-Men movie yet! The story is complex but in a nutshell, Wolverine is sent back in time to stop a series of events that start a catastrophic war in the future. Again, it is complex but the story is well put together and the cast is bursting at the seams with dozens and dozens of memorable X-Men and even more Easter eggs for the truly savvy fan. But you don't have to be a super fan in order to get enjoyment out of this movie. I'll admit I didn't know half of the mutants mentioned here, but I still left with a smile on my face. The special effects are great, the cinematography is first rate and the overall feel of the film plays like a gripping action thrill ride. X-Men: Days of Future Past does the seemingly impossible by making it OK to see even the bad X-Men movies. The bigger the mess is made the more fun it is to see it cleaned up I suppose. Of course, it is a movie about time travel and there are a few strange things in regards to that which made the movie a little confusing, but in the end its just small potatoes compared to the massive victory of a film this is. X-Men: Days of Future Past gets a 4.5...out of 5."
"tankace","9","1","1","16 June 2016"," Best X-Men movie up until Deadpool!!
","X-men Days of Future Past is the best X-men Movie of the main series and second if you count Deadpool. It is based in the comic of the same name and for those in the loop here is the basic story. After devastating War against the Sentinels ,robots programmed to hunt mutants, the team of the X-men sends Wolverine back in time in order to stop the cause of the fight from ever happening and by that preventing the War from occurring.<br/><br/>The future itself is terrifying and comparing it with the mid seventies,where Logan has gone, makes you wander how an action decades before a tragedy can make or prevent the event. In the seventies also we meet the main cast of the characters of the First Class and thanks to Wolverine they are completed in the persons we all know and love. Personally after seen the flick for a third time I think that this is a Mustique film because her characters' actions show if we humans can become better or not and I really liked the portrait of Lawrence ,she is the end all Mustique ,from point of view. Pity that after the newest film she will leave the role, but she at least gave us a career define role.<br/><br/>Although the director has made some changes of the original comic the basic is there and Singer adds something more : Hope. Apart from time travel, the fear created by racism , amazing action and see both the previous cast and the new in the big screen, this X-men movie has based on hope for the future ,hope for no matter how bad it gets we can still find a solution and as Patrick Stuart himself said in the movie: ""If someone lose his path does not mean that he will stay lost"" .<br/><br/>In the end I love this flick and is my favorite comic book movie of 2014 ,even more than the Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy! With Bryan Singer on the director chair I feel safe that Apocalype will be good and the main cast are as solid choices as they get ,so Mutant and Proud comic and in general geek comrades :) !!!"
"juribeldman","9","1","1","9 June 2016"," the best movie of the franchise and no kidding!
","When the news that Matthew Vaughn, the excellent director of X- Men:First Class, would not be directing a sequel everybody was surely sad. But when Bryan Singer came on and made a return then it all seemed to be worth it. To tell the truth, Days of Future Past is the best movie in the franchise yet. Nothing has beaten it as Tim Millers Deadpool really did not get close to this and X- Men:Apocalypse is clearly not over this here. Bryan Singer does it great and cool, playing with his awesome characters and rooting them to do stuff they do all very well. The sense of the first main X-Men prequel is still her and every character is as he or she should be. The only bad thing here is that we have seemingly lost the sense of the first 2 x-men movies, but its a long awaited reunion that proves that the x-men are back in movie business with great hands."
"justbob1982","7","1","1","13 July 2015"," Ensemble super-cast hits the high notes
","Version I saw: UK cinema release<br/><br/>Actors: 7/10<br/><br/>Plot/script: 6/10<br/><br/>Photography/visual style: 7/10<br/><br/>Music/score: 6/10<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10<br/><br/>The X-Men are possibly the ultimate ensemble cast. The central half-dozen have been joined over the years by well over a hundred named characters, each with their own personalities and powers. All the more surprising then that for X-Men: Days of Future Past, they chose a plot that meant doubling up on several characters, bringing together two whole all-star casts into what amounts to an absolute galaxy of stars.<br/><br/>Of course, sacrifices must be made to some degree, so the old cast - Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry and so on - take something of a back seat as the new group brought in for X-Men: First Class predominate in the drama. This is fine, because Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are all excellent at their craft, and indeed all the best parts of this film come not from spectacle but sizzling character interactions.<br/><br/>My sister pointed out that the role of Mystique (Lawrence) in the plot doesn't quite make sense given the existence of Darwin, a character who got inconveniently killed off in First Class. Being honest though, Jennifer Lawrence can now be relied on to carry the focus of a film in a way Edi Gathegi simply can't. Or at least, not yet. There's a slight problem with Professor X too, as Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy's versions of the character - both interesting and engaging in themselves - seem just a little too different to be accounted for by the development and aging of one person.<br/><br/>The plot is outright bonkers, which follows a fine tradition of comics madness. In fact, a significant proportion of the plot revolves around characters struggling to convince each other of the truth, against their quite understandable skepticism. They make it work, though, due to returning director Bryan Singer's deft hand with character drama and returning writers Matthew Vaughn (who also directed First Class) and nerd queen Jane Goldman, who bring a real sense of playfulness that pokes gentle, affectionate fun at the plot, characters, setting and everything else that hoves into view.<br/><br/>The title is dumb, the end credit scene is far too enigmatic for its own good, and there's no Stan Lee cameo, but these are all insignificant niggles compared to the fun, excitement and character-led drama, remarkably free from the inevitable encumberance of so many characters, so much comics history and so much money. Good job, guys."
"jacobhunt6","Null","1","1","25 April 2015"," Fantastic but really annoying
","As a massive fan of the X-Men films, I love this movie and hate it at the same time. While the special effects, character development and fantastic attachment to the other films that explains so much about characters such as Magneto and Professor Xavier, were all fantastic... I found myself pulling my hair out at the fact that this entire movie simply undoes what the other SIX films set out. So, essentially, you only need to watch this ONE film to know what has happened so far - none of the rest of it counts. Quicksilver was a highlight for me, but I wish that reviewers would stop attempting to compare the Days of Future Past version to the Age of Ultron version. It is safe to say that these two are COMPLETELY different interpretations of the character, both wonderful in their own vastly different ways."
"kkmwills","2","1","1","28 February 2015"," If They Had Called It Something Else ...
","...I would have bumped my score up a couple of notches, at least. While I do have problems with the script being unwilling to present the story that was laid-out pretty well in the comics, I feel that the production was a try at getting as many name stars of the franchise together in a ""last ditch""-feeling effort to jump-start or revitalize this franchise. Get the big stars before they are too expensive. Highlight characters that aren't highlighted in the actual story that goes by the title used.<br/><br/>Still, there were moments in the movie that I actually enjoyed, the main one being the ""Time In A Bottle"" sequence. Evan Peters is a remarkable gent, when given the good stuff to play. Also, the fight in the present/future. The effects were fun to watch.<br/><br/>I think that my disappointment, even more than deviation from the source material, is that the movie I ended up watching was so very paint-by-numbers. Of course Plot Point 4v happened, that's how it always happens in these movies. If I wanted predictable, I would stay home, save the $12 of buying a ticket and concessions, and watch a classics station running older TV shows. I don't pay to see Sir Ian, Sir Patrick, Ms. Lawrence, Mr. Fassbinder, Mr. McAvoy, Ms. Page and Mr. Dinklage be predictable, not when they can be gloriously dynamic.<br/><br/>I am disappointed in the filmmakers, not the cast, but I am not wishing for that amount of time back. It entertained, the least I ask of something that I pay to see. That's why the rating of five. It did not outrage or enthrall. It was whelming."
"bowmanblue","7","1","1","14 January 2015"," You may need an 'X-men refresher' course first
","I've already seen (and even own a few) of the X-men movies (and they various spin-offs/reboots). However, maybe I should have watched a few of them before I sat down to see 'X-men: Days of Future Past.' I will admit to getting a little confused with the plot, but, eventually, I settled into the film.<br/><br/>I never could really work out whether the previous film 'First Class' was a reboot, or a prequel. Now I find it was just a prequel, as 'Days of Future Past' now cements the two universes together with that modern lynchpin of science-fiction, time travel.<br/><br/>Star Trek got a lot of praise for merging the old and the new cast together (or at least the majority of the fanboys didn't kick off as much as the possible could). So, it seems that every sci-fi franchise feels okay using the 'time travel to create an alternate universe' scenario to gloss over any glitches merging the two films may throw up (Terminator: Genisys, I have my eye on you).<br/><br/>We start in the future when giant robots (Sentinels) are mercilessly hunting both mutants and humans alike, cue a trip for our favourite cigar-chomping hero, Wolverine, to take a trip back in time to the seventies in order to make sure this future never sees the light of day. Therefore, the film-makers can crowbar in both the old cast (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and all) with the new lot (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender and so on). And, yes, it works – if you're okay with that sort of 'plot device.' It all feels well at home with the other X-men movies, not to mention distinctly different from Marvel's 'cinematic universe' of Iron Man, the Avengers and co. It's generally darker in tone and more serious, with less one-liners and colourful action. Not that the action isn't colourful (and even spectacular towards the climactic scenes), it just feels pretty computer generated. You get the CGI fiery person, the CGI icy person and the CGI sort of discount T-1000-type person as they battle their way through various CGI robots.<br/><br/>But, if you can live with a CGI that probably should be a little better for the budget involved (not to mention (future) Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman's bad haircuts) then you should be able to appreciate this movie. Like I say, I got a little confused by the timelines and what everyone was doing. However, that would probably have been cleared up by watching what came before a little more recently. There's plenty of action, explosions and twists and turns in the plot. Plus – perhaps best of all – is that there's plenty of (fan favourite) Wolverine. Many had criticised his two stand-alone movies, whereas here he seems like the natural star who the film is basically all about. But, it's not just about him – there are plenty of other recognisable faces to entertain – just make sure you know your 'X-men lore' before you spend two hours watching this lot."
"nicolechan916","8","1","1","5 November 2014"," Great visuals and ensemble of characters but plot was pretty average.
","Having only watched one of the previous X-Men films, I wasn't really expecting much. But after watching this, it rekindled the little kid in me that used to watch the animated X-Men shows on television. It was great to see all kinds of mutants (and actors/actresses) with different powers, even though I didn't know their background. Cool stuff. The visuals and effects were really well done. It seemed like a more mature film than I had imagined based on the previous films.<br/><br/>The acting too was on point, everyone played their parts and got into their characters really well. At one point I even consciously acknowledged this when McAvoy as Xavier was concentrating really hard and you could see the vein on his forehead bulge out. The character developments was also well explored and it showed on screen. The character of Quicksilver was a really good addition. He added a comedic effect and the slow motion scenes were great and accurately complimented the character.<br/><br/>However there are quite a few things I have a problem with, mainly with the plot. It seemed a bit too easy for Wolverine to convince the younger Xavier and Magneto to believe him, when he didn't really do much himself. And why are Xavier and Magneto the only ones ageing? There's a strong difference between the characters from the past and present..hmm now that I think about it, it's probably because the rest of the mutants weren't in the present (with the exception of Wolverine who's immortal). OK like I said, I didn't watch the other films. I'm wanting to now though.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was a really cool film, with cool characters and a kind of cool plot. It's just that it kind of made everything seem...redundant. If you've watched it, you'll get what I mean.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
"sohansurag","7","1","1","15 September 2014"," Brian Singer tries to undo the X-Men franchise damages
","I remember the time when I was all jacked up when I saw the previews of X-Men. I was blown away when I saw the movie on VHS as well. Such an ensemble cast and Wolverine seemed to pack quite the punch. X2 Xmen United was better than I'd expected and the less said about X- Men The Last Stand, the better. Bryan Singer undoubtedly a skilled director as evident from The Usual Suspects and not to mention handling an ensemble cast like X-Men was no easy feat. But a look back at his recent flicks (Superman Returns, Jack The Giant Slayer), you are bound to set your hopes a bit low for X-Men Days of Future Past. Despite his fairly brilliant initial track record, I myself was skeptic about X-Men Days of Future Past especially when Matthew Vaughn's X-Men First Class had a set a bar at how well made an X-Men could be.<br/><br/>Off to a very rocky start, Days of Future Past introduces to a dystopian 2023 run by Sentinels and the few remaining mutants fighting for their lives. I mentioned 'rocky' coz you are thrown into the thick of the action and despite the brilliant sequence, if you are not familiar with the X-Men lore you'd be wondering who these mutants are. You'll feel right at home when Charles Xavier, Eric Lensher Logan and Storm enters the scene. Logan is sent back to 1973 by Kitty Pride to prevent Trask Industries to ever build these Sentinels. Logan meets up with a younger Xavier, Hank, Eric and Raven and sets about to save the world once again. What ensures is a good two plus hours of entertainment.<br/><br/>Time Travel is used as a plot device and a lot could go wrong if there ain't much thought put into it. Thanks to Bryan Singer the comic series of the same name, time travel n Days of Future Past works just fine. It fills in most of the conflicts caused in the franchise's timeline but then again by the end of Days Of Future Past, the original X-Men trilogy supposedly never happens (If I am correct). There are some nifty sequences that'll make you go Whoa. The Magneto Prison break sequence in particular, left me in awe, thanks to Quicksilver. This rendition of Quicksilver was so good and leaves me wondering if this version would come on top if it had to go head to head with the upcoming Joss Whedon version from The Avengers Age of Ultron. I guess you cant have too much of a good thing as Quicksilver is sent home just after the said sequence.<br/><br/>Unlike the spinoffs the X-Men series had always been about the Mutant-Human war and its the same here. There is a ton of other story arcs that had loads more potential but it sticks to the same formulaic arc. Another qualm were the mere glimpses of mutants like Bishop, Wink, Colossus and even Storm and used as just baits. While the mutants showed off some cool combat, these are pretty relevant characters from the X-Men series and to make them just cannon fodder, not cool! X- Men Days Of Future past delivers but I felt it doesn't have that charm or the heart X-Men First Class had. And if ranked X-Men Days of Future Past might be a notch below X2 X-Men United and First Class. There is a ton of fan service here and it is also advised to watch the past X- Men movies to get the complete gist of Days of Future Past.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer once again proves that he's good with an ensemble cast. Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Peter Dinklage, Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Ellen Page all plays noteworthy roles in Days of Future Past. If this isn't star studded, I don't know what is. In almost all the previous X-Men movies Hugh Jackman usually steals the show, and he does most of the heavy lifting here as well but a bit of the limelight is also shared or rather snatched by James McAvoy playing the younger Xavier. McAvoy displays a remarkable performance and brings in layers of emotions to the man in the wheel chair. Michael Fassbender also shines throughout with his cold steel looks and grey shades. Jennifer Lawrence excels in being Mystique as well as sexy and becomes one of the most indispensable characters in the narrative. Boliver Trask wasn't even a dwarf in the original X- Men lore and yet Peter Dinklage nails it, his acting prowess was all that was needed and not his height.<br/><br/>The visuals were fairly impressive, but I did notice some itsy bitsy flaws here and there. I loved the way the footages from 1973 had a kind of Eastman color shade to it. The Future Sentinels were impressively rendered and felt daunting indeed. The X-Men theme makes a comeback as well, Thanks to John Ottman. While it wouldn't even come close to Henry Jackman's awe inspiring original score from X-Men First Class, Ottman's score still brought forth a sense of nostalgia.<br/><br/>X-Men Days of Future Past is a great comeback for Bryan Singer and some of the faith in him has been restored. It doesn't break any grounds and despite its gaping plot holes and flaws, X-Men Days of Future Past makes for a good entertaining flick. Go watch it!<br/><br/>PS: As its tradition, do wait for the credit roll to get over for some awesome Post Credit Sequence paving way to the next in series: X-Men Apocalypse."
"sushant0406","7","1","1","20 September 2014"," Slightly confusing, still an entertaining watch.
","Really had been waiting to watch this installment of the X-Men,one of my favourite series. Needless to say it was far more entertaining than the second Wolverine movie and X Men-3.<br/><br/>The story was well written, although would have been better had they explained the time-travel aspect a little more. The story picks up in 2023, when the sentinels have all but eliminated the mutants and the humans who had tried to defend them. The only was is to go back in the past and stop an assassination, that would inturn cause the sentinels to be made.<br/><br/>Of the cast, Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine marches right from the front. This has been his best portrayal as Wolverine. Jackman's acting is on the rise since Les Miserables and again he was truly impressive. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, were again superb in their respective roles of the younger Professor X and Magneto; especially McAvoy. Jennifer Lawrence, Peter Dinklage and Nicholas Hoult were also good in their respective roles. However there was not enough screen time for Patrick Stewart(old Professor X), Sir Ian McKellen(old Magneto) and Halle Berry(Storm) to make a mark on the viewers and their performances could be regarded as a guest appearance at the most. Ellen Page, again had hardly any screen time, but did a decent job. The other X Men, sadly to say were wasted. But, this was expected,wasn't it?<br/><br/>The major disappointment for me was the lack of a characteristic Marvel soundtrack, that would give a normal guy goosebumps.The energy was totally amiss, because of that. However, like most other Marvel movies there is an end credit scene, which from the looks of it was good and I would like to see the characters shown in that scene, in the next X- Men movie."
"DonaldDooD","7","1","1","21 July 2014"," The First Superhero Movie I Liked In a Long Time
","I'm not a fan of superhero comic books, but I'm not against the idea of superhero movies. Its just that few of them escape the clichés of the hundreds of other actions films out there. The Dark Knight was pretty good half a decade ago (tarnished by edgy teenage misanthropes, but that's not TDK's fault), but since then Marvel and DC either didn't interest me or disappointed. I was mildly interested in seeing this due to its high Rotten Tomatoes score, so I chose this for a movie outing with a friend.<br/><br/>It was actually a perfectly solid action flick. I wouldn't say it sets a new bar, but it avoided clichés by focusing on character. In fact, action and character development were evenly matched.<br/><br/>The conflict between Professor X and Magneto is done surprisingly well. You wouldn't think a superhero movie would do a good job at showing the clashing sides of moderate vs extremist activism, yet both sides are portrayed realistically. Magneto is villainous, of course, but he's not evil for the sake of evil. Professor X believes that humans can be taught to accept Mutants, yet all their crimes make Magneto convinced only one race should reign on Earth. And its not easy to debunk him. Mystique was also well done, not subservient to either side.<br/><br/>There was too much gristle in terms of the number of superheros. Professor X, Magneto, and Mystique are the only vital characters to the plot. Wolverine, Beast, and Kitty Pride serve important roles, but don't have a character arc. Perhaps twice as many characters make cameos, but ultimately are forgettable unless you read the comics. The action never wowed me, personally. Some of parts against the Sentinels were cool, but predictable.<br/><br/>Regardless, the characters were strong enough to hold the movie for me. A 7/10 may not seem like much, but its above average. I think it deserves its large box office toll, and I'm curious if the sequel can maintain this quality."
"RockerJarvis","7","1","1","15 June 2014"," Another solid X-Men film, if lacking a little substance.
","Here we are again for another Bryan Singer X-men film, and this one has all the hype that his last 2011 X-men outing had, X-men: First Class, but this time its back to the past, then the future, and then the past again and the future, which actually is the present in the film, but the future to us, and the past again wait WHAT!<br/><br/>Actually it's not that hard to follow, we have some of the current X-men crop, Storm and Wolverine along with Magneto and Professor X meeting up with a group of other mutants, lead by Bishop and Kitty Pryde. The reason for this meet up, well, like most problems in this darn universe, it's the pesky humans that need a helping hand, but actually this time the Mutants need some major help too, so Logan ET AL need to find a way to save everyone from the current (2023) destructive nature and ongoing problems caused by the super advanced versions of the robot Sentinel program that fast tracked into development and launched in the 70′s.<br/><br/>Fortunately Kitty Pryde has the ability to project someone's consciousness back in time, and she uses this to keep ahead of the current (2023) sentinels who are obliterating both mutants and humans, and by the looks of things New York (poor New York, it's always getting destroyed, it's a super villain haven). Kitty, along with Bishop, Iceman, Colossus, Blink, Warpath and Sunspot use her ability as a warning tool so that they can work out what to do and how to survive against the ongoing and relentless attacks from the Sentinels. The Sentinel robots, are so powerful now against nearly all Mutant abilities that along with modification from events that happened in the 70′s from when the program was started by Boliva Trask, they now have the ability to change or deflect the incoming attack of mutants depending on the type of attack, be it ice, fire, water, plasma etc, thus with it, making the Sentinels nigh on indestructible.<br/><br/>This prompts Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Ian Mckellen) and the gang to use Kitty's ability to send someone back in time to before the Sentinel program was put into full effect. They decided that never ageing Logan is the only real person who could take on this task so they send him back to 1973 to try to change the actions of a young Raven/Mystique who more than likely set in motion the current devastating events all the way up into our current future point, 2023.<br/><br/>Raven or Mystique, which ever name you wish to call her, depending on her current state or action, is played by the ever popular and ever busy Jennifer Lawrence, for the 2nd film running. In terms of story, she is major player in this, as this is the sole reason why Logan (Hugh Jackman) is sent back in the past, to go and meet a young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and young Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) to try to stop Raven/Mystique (Lawrence) in, lets say, a few bullet point issues for Boliva Trask (Peter Dinklage) that caused her to then be captured, and having her shape shifting cells used in the future Sentinel technology by Trask's company.<br/><br/>Along the way we come across a few familiar faces, with the like of Beast (Nicholas Hoult) also playing a big part (not just looking dapper in a full brown 70′s suede suit! – check left!) in helping to get our young Charles Xavier in the right frame of mind, as well as the likes of Quick Silver (Evan Peters) who has the chance to show his abilities to the masses, and shall we say, get the better a few security guards all by himself, and not just playing a bit of table tennis against himself!<br/><br/>I still think I preferred the pacing of X-men: First Class over 'Days of Future Past'. There seems to be more of a focused start, middle and end in 'First class', we as the viewer knew what needed to be done, and it was straight forward, yet here in 'Days of Future Past' it can be a little messy and confusing to the time line (especially considering that it disregards everything from X3 .. but everyone has been trying to disregards X3 for years now, so maybe that's a good thing), however if we were to put the latest two X-men films against each other, 'First Class' and 'Future Past' I really wouldn't be surprised if both films were in many's top 3, or even the top 2 of people's favourite X-men films.<br/><br/>As like 'First Class', Days of Future Past is still excellently written, with some great action, and some fantastic story elements. We have fan favourites making appearances, the likes of Quick Silver is always a good thing, and with the story element of going into the past and future it leaves things open to cameos, maybe from characters we never thought we'd see again (YET STILL NO GAMBIT!). There are some really funny moments and even though some here and seem a little forced, the producers are confident enough in their final product of this action comic adaptation, that they are not shy of putting some laughs in, and you could easily look past those moments if you feel like it and still see the rest of the quality flowing through this film.<br/><br/>Some characters in my opinion are a little underused, as I would have liked more Quick Silver considering his hype and the likes of Colossus who I'm a fan of, however having not read the original source material, for all I know this is the way most of the story went, and even if it wasn't I still think generally everyone should be very pleased on this X-men outing and how the story played out.<br/><br/>My Reviews at ItsMuchMore.com"
"Sjaaksnaak","6","1","1","13 June 2014"," Epic movie! Not perfect though..
","A 6? Yes, a 6!<br/><br/>First off: don't get me wrong here. I always have and always will love all manner of superhero comic books, games, T.V. series and movies.<br/><br/>Yes! X-men: Days of future past is one of the most awesome x-men/comic movies there is, at the moment. All of the heroes and villains almost stunned me with awe when they appeared on the big screen (again). I nearly shed a tear of joy when I finally saw Colossus kicking ass. All the action scenes in this movie are exactly what you want to see your beloved characters do. The story was also satisfying from beginning to end and indeed easy to follow. Well.. maybe not until the very end, but I'll get to that.<br/><br/>I came across multiple posts where no-one could find any flaws with this movie. Here is the part where I disagree.<br/><br/>Remember people, this is not just another X-men movie. This is a sequel! And that's where I'm basing my.. somewhat disappointment on. If they make more movies, try to imagine marathon watching the movies and this comes directly after First Class and before the next.<br/><br/>First, First Class left a beautiful opening for further development for existing and new comic heroes and villains. But in my opinion they totally ignored this. Yes we got to see a lot of new (blockbuster) characters, but no development whatsoever. They're just there all of a sudden. So you would have to have a Marvel knowledge that goes beyond any previous movies to know certain characters. I know they also do this in other movies, but First Class did such an excellent job in multiple character development. In DOFP I had the feeling the only characters that were being developed further were Charles and Raven. <br/><br/>After the ending of First Class I can kind of understand Charles feeling a little low. But did we really wanted to see an x-year skip so Bruce Way... I mean Charles can pull himself together? Not me at least. I was hoping to see how they would find more troubled mutants in their younger years, building the school to what it would ultimately become. Meet or accidentally create some fun villains along the way. Now I understand this could kinda give it a TV-series feel, but they could have figured something out. And also, was this an X-men movie with Wolverine? Or the other way round?<br/><br/>The story was.. awesome! No, really. But herein lies my biggest problem, it felt like the last in a line of movies. The epic finale where we have spent so much time working towards. After seeing this movie, should they make another one, how are they going to top this? Apocalypse, maybe. But are we going to make another time skip to where the school is fully built and suddenly ""oh noes, up in the sky, is a bird.. carp it's Apocalypse"". Sure there are more options left for a more epic battle than this was, but it sorta felt to me like they wanted to do this movie quick before some of the cast of the previous three movies kick the bucket.<br/><br/>Actually what kinda ruins the ending a little bit for me. Is the whole time-travel to make THE PREVIOUS THREE MOVIES (witch they were at first trying to intertwine with) UNDONE! They just did not happen after this movie? To give the older movies a sort of happy ending? Or so they won't have to worry about continuity anymore? And yes the comics have this and they have multiple time-lines, universes and whatnot. But it was a cheap trick clean slate in Heroes, so why not here? <br/><br/>I've only seen the movie two times so far. So I am aware that I might have missed the flawlessness everyone is talking about due to the awesomeness that was there. Maybe I just don't understand the whole time-travel-thingamajig. So feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. I might even change my opinion myself after watching it again and again... and probably again.<br/><br/>X-men: Days of Future Past as one of the most epic superhero movies out there! 9,5/10 <br/><br/>X-men: Days of Future Past as a Sequel to X-men: First Class. 6/10"
"kk-711-186122","7","1","1","30 May 2014"," X-Men: Days of Future Past - Aka. The Wolverine 6
","After watching the 6 previous X-men movies, 5 of which where centered around wolverine, I did not have too high expectations for this one. And 10 minutes in when it becomes apparent that this one will also have wolverine as the main character, my eyes rolled back in my head.<br/><br/>However, this time they really nailed it. The plot is as tight as you can get with a time traveling plot in an action movie. Yes, the opening is a total ripoff of Terminator 2, yes it's predictable, yes it's too long, yes there are too many characters. <br/><br/>However... The pacing is good, the plot is exiting (despite being predictable), the action is really great. The effects are great and not cheap looking. There is plenty of nerdgasem moments and it was great to see the old crew back together.<br/><br/>To summarize, it's not Citizen Kane or Donnie Brasco, and to be honest it's probably not even Dark Knight, but I think this is about as good of an X-Men movie as you are going to get. I enjoyed this much more than Dark Knight Rises and probably more than Avengers too. I really liked it. Go see it.<br/><br/>Ps. I did not watch it in 3D, because I am an adult."
"ohashmawi","Null","1","1","29 May 2014"," X-Men: Days of Future Past is an electric, action-packed movie, easily the best in the entire franchise, and maybe one of the best comic book films ever.
","I wasn't really sure about this movie, I mean time travel is something that can screw movies real good, and there were probably going to be a bunch of continuity errors, but man was I wrong (at least partially). X- Men: Days of Future Past is absolutely badass! It is a really awesome movie, despite the continuity stuff, this film was so riveting, action- packed and funny that you don't even care about the coherency with the other films, because this one is probably the best one. <br/><br/>The acting in X-Men DOFP is really good, everyone does a great job, there isn't a false note anywhere in the movie. In terms of the main characters, Hugh Jackman is always great as Wolverine, I don't really need to talk about him too much, because he is awesome every time. But there's something in this movie that I really liked, we see Wolverine as a more human character, he doesn't go nuts as much as he usually does, and I thought it was pretty cool to see him in a different light. James McAvoy was just incredible! I loved how they humanized his character, when Patrick Stewart plays him, you can't really relate to him, because he's the know-it-all mentor, in First Class too, but in this movie he at an all-time low in life, he's so sad, cynical, and human, really great acting. Michael Fassbender is also really good, he may be the bad guy, but there's this one scene where, despite him being a dick(god, he is such a prick in this movie) you can understand where he's coming from, watching him and Charles interact is really interesting. Jennifer Lawrence is also always incredible, she still has that human element she had in First Class, but she's way more badass here. Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and the other old-school X-Men are really cool, (Old Magneto had a really badass scene during the final act in the future, it just made me scream in joy), but the new additions are awesome as well, I particularly liked Blink and Bishop, their powers made for some INCREDIBLE fight scenes. But someone who absolutely blew me away was Evan Peters as Quicksilver. He is the coolest character in the movie, easily, I feel so bad that I was on the band wagon that thought he looked really bad, but he is so awesome! The scene where he demonstrates his powers with the cops is one of the best scenes I've seen, ever. He was such a funny and interesting character. Peter Dinklage is also very good in this movie, I just didn't get his character's reason for hating mutants so much, which is kind of big, but I forgave that one. And there's a point where you think, ""With such a big cast, can I really care about all of the characters? Yes you can! You care about every single one of the X-Men! Even the ones who don't appear that much like Storm and Iceman, they aren't all developed though, but that's okay, because they're just supporting characters.<br/><br/>This film is so exciting, it is on from the opening credits which are awesome (hearing the original X-Men theme again was just indescribable), until the also awesome post-credits scene, even when the characters are just talking is interesting. The action is amazing, again the scene with Quicksilver is incredible, but the final act, the one in the future is so awesome! The cinematography, directing, 3D are all top- notch in this film. The special effects here are absolutely incredible, all technical aspects are as well. The directing by Bryan Singer is fantastic, there's this one scene with Mystique, where a person is filming her with a really old 70s camera, and the footage from the camera is played in the middle of the scene, those shots were fantastic! They added such a realistic feeling to the scene, that was a great idea.<br/><br/>The writing in this movie is very good, they made the time travel concept plausible (for this movie), they kept it simple. And what they did with the ending was awesome! You could say they kind of fixed some mistakes of other X-Men films. The story is really great, it's a great mixture between the comic story and something new that they created, it works really well. This movie handles its multitude of characters by making them important to one of the central story arcs, and it's great! However there were some flaws, I'm talking about the continuity errors, most of them couldn't be avoided of course, but there was one that really stuck out, and I didn't understand the reason for it, it was Wolverine's Adamantium claws (in the future/present), and this is something that's incoherent with the ending of another X-Men film. What they did there could have been changed, to me there was no logical explanation for his Adamantium claws. And that was my biggest flaw with the film. Another flaw was that the final act in the past was a bit underwhelming compared to the rest of the film's fights, it didn't have the intended effect on me, it did not feel like there was a lot at stake, don't know why, but it just didn't. And those were my only flaws.<br/><br/>This film is really fun, I wasn't sure what to expect, but what I got was an intense, funny, action-packed and absolutely entertaining X-Men adventure. Days of Future Past is really awesome, it masterfully concludes the X-Men franchise revival mission, which started with First Class, continued with The Wolverine, and ended with X-Men: Days of Future Past. I recommend this movie."

Bryan Singer, the guy who gave us the original X-men way back in 2000s, created 'the' perfect sequel to 'X-men: First Class' and opened up avenues to the forthcoming sequels.<br/><br/>As the name suggests, the movie has some zip-zapping into past and present (the title's aptly chosen from the franchise's comic). This is going to be the biggest hit of this summer; only party spoilers can be Age of Extinction and Dawn of Planet of Apes. However, this will go into the annals of history as one of the finest made X-men movies. Period.<br/><br/>You may notice some uncanny semblances with The Matrix (stop-motion sequences and even the sentinels), Déjà vu (quantum physics about changing the past), Watchmen (of Vietnam War and Nixon) and to some extent, Terminator 4 (ravaged future earth). But the resemblances stop here. Of course revealing anything more will spoil the fun.<br/><br/>There are quite a handful breathtaking, rather, breath-stopping moments; particularly one scene where QuickSilver zaps with his supersonic run while time almost freezes for the others.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is great, is a sort of an understatement. The cinematography will give you goose flesh. The music is intense but a tad lesser than the score of First Class. Micheal Fassbender as Eric Lehnsherr continues his cold and callous form from First Class. And he steals the show along with James McAvoy. Jennifer Lawrence as Raven is outstanding; so beautiful yet so Mystique. The X-entourage - Hugh Jackman, Ellen Page, Ian McKellen (to name a few) do more than justice to their roles. The sentinels, however steal the show, for they are hyper-intelligent and are far more powerful than the mutants themselves.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen any of the X-men movies, please do that first and then go to watch this one. You will enjoy each and every minute of it. The movie starts off with some fantabulous action sequence, but the adrenaline pumping slows down for a while, giving way to some intense drama. And while you are immensely engrossed, the movie catapults you to a higher level of pure action and edge of the seat thrills. You are allowed to bite your nails, pull your hair but don't take your eyes off the screen.<br/><br/>Behold the glory of X-men, for all-ye X-men fans. The X-men series is getting better with the inception of First Class (my best X-men movie ever) and there is more to come. Viola. Post-credits show En Saba Nur and the four horsemen – a perfect teaser to the upcoming X-men: Apocalypse in 2016.<br/><br/>EXperience the eXplosive and the eXalting X-men. It's eXquisite and eXemplar. Highly and heavily recommended."

","It's difficult to talk about all the good things in this movie. Magnificent actors ,a story so great that no matter how difficult it was for Bryan Singer to deliver , in the end the satisfaction was there. No pointless action was also a plus for my review . I always wanted to see the depth of the story , the emotions of the characters , and this movie's got it all . Also bear in mind that this movie was also a try to fix the problems that the latest x-movies had created. Yet that is also done in the end . Another thing is that Hugh Jackman not only once again proves how he can perfectly perform the same role in a different mode ,since wolverine is more like a mentor in this one , but also how he can still be in 100% body shape for years in success. Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen bring their experience in and a combination with Fassbender's and Mcavoy's great performances is a boost . Now i can't wait for the next one ."

","Regardless and what you think of any X-men you seen in the past (The so-so trilogy or the Wolverine origin movies) this movie will show you something that all fans of the series have been waiting for....<br/><br/>A serious and heartfelt plot line.....<br/><br/>I have heard that a lot of people are turned off by the idea of the new and old and did not think that it would work but i assure you director Bryan Singer made it so.<br/><br/>I encourage all to see this movie even if your not a fan of x-men. Its a great action movie with a fantastic story that will keep you gripped to the end of the movie."
"sl_3301","9","1","1","24 May 2014"," The future looks bright for the X-Men franchise
","I have waited months for X-Men: Days of Future Past to be released and finally got the chance to see it yesterday. I had high expectations going into the film due to all of the marketing, trailers and build up and it's fair to say the film exceeded my expectations. The film delivers on all levels from the acting, visual effects, storyline and action. All of the cast give impressive performances, but James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence stood out to me the most. One of my favourite scenes in the film is the prison break scene where we get to see Quicksilver in action. Not only do we see Quicksilver in action we get to see things from his perspective when he's moving at superhuman speed. I liked how the film slipped in a little reference to the father and son relationship between him and Magneto.<br/><br/>A lot of new characters make their big screen debut such as Bishop, Warpath, Sunspot and Blink. Although most of the new characters have little screen time they make a big impression and we get to see them go toe-to-toe with the Sentinels. It was great to see characters like Blink and Bishop in action and how they use their abilities to battle the Sentinels. Another highlight of the film for me was seeing Iceman (Bobby Drake) in full ice form performing the famous ice slide. The overall tone of the film is a lot darker than previous X-Men films, but there's a lot more at stake in this film. There's still humour in the film and a few one liners that will give you a laugh. In my opinion X-Men: Days of Future Past is one of the best films of the franchise and it's a good job Bryan Singer returned to direct the franchise he started on the big screen. Bryan Singer also rectifies a lot of the events which took place in X-Men: The Last Stand giving the impression that the film never happened. The future looks bright for the X-Men franchise and I can't wait for X-Men: Apocalypse to be released."
"rgkarim","9","1","1","24 May 2014"," Three tales unite into one, well done Singer
","Happy Memorial day weekend my friends, and what better way to welcome the weekend than with another movie review. Today we cover the new X-men movie, a series which over the last 14 years has split into three story arcs that has led to a mixture of receptions. Yet director Bryan Singer has returned to the project to hopefully clean the mess others have made, hopefully returning the spark the first two movies held. Did it work? Read on to find out.<br/><br/>From the trailers, X-men Days of Futures Past is a time traveling adventure that sends the rugged Wolverine back into the past to meet up with the youthful, though distraught, X- men. The goal of this mission is to stop the construction of the legendary mutant hunting sentinels, and prevent a dark future from arising that could mean the end of humanity. <br/><br/>I know a bit cliché, but despite the stale time traveling story line the latest X-men feature has a lot of great qualities. We'll start with the acting. Days of Future Past has a lot of characters that fans will recognize and perhaps be excited to see. Hugh Jackman has stepped back into the Wolverine role, still bringing the tough guy with a big heart and even bigger edge back to the screen. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender reprise their roles as young X and magneto, bringing back some of their chemistry, while bringing other qualities to their characters. Of course most are interested in Ms. Popularity herself, Jennifer Lawrence, playing the young, and deadly, Mystique. Of all the characters, she has the broadest emotional spectrum, which Lawrence once again brings to life in her typical fashion that makes many lover her. The rest of the group does well, but due to space limitations and the fact they are secondary, I'll move on. <br/><br/>Despite the story being just another time traveling tale, X-men Days of Future Past has great delivery to pull it off well. The first twenty minutes set the stage in an explosive opening, setting the pace and time limit of the movie. Once back in the past, Wolverine sets out to accomplish his goals, bringing in the rest of the crew gradually. This is where Singer's work speaks for itself as he somehow reveals more of his character's, while still keeping the film moving. I didn't see too many scenes where the mission had to stop while the group had a heart to heart *cough Batman *cough. <br/><br/>As these characters changed, for better or for worse, the story twisted, keeping the plot fresh and more unpredictable than some of the tales in the past. It was great trying to figure out what the characters would do next, wondering how far some of the mutants would go to destroy the evil without throwing the events further into chaos. Of course, there are plenty of hints that take away from the surprise that, if you pay attention, will help you predict what is coming next, with a few exceptions of course.<br/><br/>Yet the thing I really loved about this movie was how balanced everything was. Singer once again brought a blend of traits to his project that was done in the appropriate amounts. The comedic timing was top notch, having both old, new, and X-men reference styles present that were not overdone nor rubbed in my face. Drama was spread out evenly, not focusing on one character's drama for too long nor was it focused on a single type of drama (i.e. just on romantic affairs), keeping me interested instead of asking when will this end. Even the action was done well, with the opening getting the pace of the movie started, and ending with heated excitement to wrap up the intense story line. Such balance is key to many movies my friends, and something that many other genres lack. <br/><br/>Of course there is no perfect movie, and X-men does have a few flaws for me. While they did a great job tying the three stories together, Singer and company had a few story stretches that were a bit too far-fetched for me. The explanation for how Xavier could walk, or how the X-men could so easily sneak about were just two examples. Another flaw included how some of the characters, primarily first class, were written off, requiring some close attention to detail to determine their fate. I know there are probably good reasons for this approach, but they best be careful for their next films to avoid any conflict. As for the action, while very balanced I wanted more. Special effects wise it was great, but the scenes lacked some excitement, and were surprisingly shorter than I had anticipated from the trailers. <br/><br/>Overall Days of Future Past was one of, if not the best X-men movie I've seen. All three stories are integrated into a tale that will keep you on the edge, and is one of those suspenseful movies that keeps you on the edge of your seat. With a balanced plot line, well done action, and some great acting, fans of the series may have their faith restored that this series can be good. Yes they still have some things to work on, but I trust that the next movie can be just as good, especially with the end of the credits scene. Just make sure to bring Singer back for that as well!<br/><br/>Score overall: <br/><br/>Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0 Movie overall: 8.5"
"adrongardner","9","1","1","23 May 2014"," Slaughterhouse X-Five: or How to save us all from Disney's trash
","Logan has come unstuck in time and he's out to set right what Brett Ratner put very, very wrong. I hope Disney never acquires all the Marvel properties, because if they do, good stories like this will never see the light of day. All Disney Marvel movies consist of pantomime passing as action and flying fortress defense contract builders posing as villains. There are no people in Disney Marvel movies, only rubber suits and cardboard cut-outs.<br/><br/>The Avengers was just Transformers. Thor was boring. I can't even recall Captain America and Iron Man 3 was probably the worst movie made in the last ten years. Sony isn't guiltless. Sure these new Spiderman movies are boring and soulless, but Disney is taking the Brett Ratner blow torch approach to everything they touch. The house of the Mouse cares only to serve up toy licensing on the cheap, employing shoddy stories, bad actors and TV directors. Days of Futures Past on the other hand is a pro job. It's made with a degree of dramatic vision, written well and acted impeccably from a true ensemble.<br/><br/>The first twenty minutes in Days of Future Past are a little clunky. There's so much story to put into motion, the script almost can't handle it. Soon enough, we meet Quicksliver and it's a lark from there on out. While everybody does pretty good, it's Michael Fassbender and the utterly peerless James McAvoy who anchor this film from start to finish. Sure it's a great story, but much like the last go-around, these two titans carry this film part and parcel to the very end. And boy is there an quadrilateral equine whopper at the end.<br/><br/>You simply cannot, and I wager will not, ever see this caliber of acting from any Disney Marvel property ever. Comic books were never truly about monsters, flying fortresses, bulletstorms or magic. In fact the best were always allegory. Marvel never had the big names like Batman and Superman, but they had super heroes, mutants or titans struggling with the same basic things we all do: loss, responsibility, love and doubt. I'm glad to see the team behind Days of Future Past realized that underneath all the rubber suits, even a mutant can be human."
"mikecart1","10","1","1","22 May 2014"," Best X-Men Movie Ever By Far. Best Marvel Movie Ever Too!
","Not going to give spoilers, but let's just say this: I haven't watched a movie in theaters like this since TDK trilogy where you were actually hoping the movie wouldn't end and that the story would continue.<br/><br/>This movie from beginning to end is top notch in story telling, action, and in keeping to the source material. As a huge fan of the time travel saga from the X-Men cartoons, this movie was just amazing. You get all the characters of that time which include Bishop and his friends.<br/><br/>On the other side, you get the past and present characters of the X-Men. You get cameos here and there. Mystique and Wolverine were awesome.<br/><br/>For those that want jokes, this movie has them. However, this movie is a lot darker than the Avengers, Captain America, and Thor movies. I would put the ""dark"" level in between TDK and Ironman 1.<br/><br/>Overall, see this MOVIE NOW! Also stay for the ending. You haven't got goosebumps yet until you see what I saw!!! 10 out of 10! A rare perfect movie. Blows away the other X-Men movies and is the best Marvel movie made yet!"
"bbickley13-921-58664","10","1","1","23 May 2014"," Best of both worlds!!!
","Bryan Singer is back at the helm and he nails it with Days of Future Past, hands down this is going to be one of the best movies of the summer.<br/><br/>I was a little scared how the story was going to pan out because of the poster that shows Jenifer Lawrence just as huge as Hugh Jackman, fearing that the story would reflect her status as an Oscar winning star, but unlike most of the other X-Men movies this movie is not even the Wolverine show. Every major character got more of a chance to shine in this flick.<br/><br/>And of course the best part of the film is the mutants. We got to see some old ones like Shadowcat, played by Ellen Page, who uses her powers differently in this film, and new ones like Quicksilver who proves super fast heroes are awesome. It was great to see them use their powers, but will admit Singer still has a long way to go with special effects.<br/><br/>Peter Dinklage brings the drama to the cast. His outing as Bolivar Trask the major bad guy was perfect, and it's good to see him do stuff outside of Game of Thrones. <br/><br/>The movie does not fully pay attention to the continuity of all the films, but what's good about time travel is that it sets everything in place. Now we are fully completing with the Marvel cinematic universe over at Disney. Can't wait to see X-Men: Apocalypse now. <br/><br/>You got to see this one."
"cnickels13","10","1","1","23 May 2014"," Great Storyline and Top-Notch Acting
","A phenomenal addition to the X-Men movie collection. It was nice to see so many of the characters we grew up seeing in the comics make appearances in this movie, even if they were briefly shown. It's nice to see Beast in the picture now as well. <br/><br/>I give the casting director two thumbs up on his casting of Evan Peters as Quicksilver. He played the part perfectly and I really don't think anyone else could have done as well as he did. <br/><br/>Though the story was twisted a bit from the original comic book storyline, I think the sequence of events that took place and how it all connects was just outstanding. A very well written script and very well designed scenes. As always, the graphics were superb.<br/><br/>10 stars to Days of Future Past and I cannot wait to see the next one. The teaser after the credits is worth waiting for. It's going to be really good."
"MikeM1984","10","1","1","23 May 2014"," I don't know if I just saw the best Superhero movie yet, but I might have.
","After seeing this movie I tried to compare it to others I had seen, as I often do. I usually find most of the ones I watch to finish somewhere below the traditional greats: X2, The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2, Avengers, Superman...until now. I'll have to see it a few more times before the novelty wears off but that may have been the best superhero film I have ever seen. And I stress the word ""film"" because that's the only way I can describe a movie with so many emotional beats, such strong subtext, so many layers, so much complexity and so many gut wrenching moments.<br/><br/>From watching Mystique review autopsy files, to painfully watching the X-Men graphically die in a lynch mob of Sentinels can not be describes in comparison to other superhero movies. They felt less like scenes from another cape-inspired summer blockbuster and more like scenes from Schlinder's List.<br/><br/>The movie also does an excellent job of being an allegory for racism; the trump card X-Men holds over all other heroes. It means something. Unlike Batman who is a rich playboy, or Iron Man who is a rich playboy or Spider-Man who is a broke supposedly hard luck case who none the less bags tons of pretty ladies, or Cap who is a universally loved war hero, the X-Men are outcasts. As the movie so perfectly depicts, they're lives are not perfect. These characters don't fall into normal caricatures of ""good"" and ""bad"". Everyone is a mix, everyone is broken.<br/><br/>There's no pretty girl for them to impress, most of them are not surrounded by wealth and all of them are normal faces who blend into the crowd but are not part of the crowd. The movie makes you feel truly sorry for that.<br/><br/>There is no superhero formula in this movie. The good guys don't necessarily ""win"", the bad guys don't even ""lose"". Even with a future averted, the future still is not set. And it leaves you with the feeling that maybe this never ends, and there is more to come. Much more."
"shanescx","10","1","1","23 May 2014"," This Film Rights All Wrongs
","This film is as good as First Class if not better, which I consider as the best film in the franchise.<br/><br/>I didn't expect too much from this film though I was anticipating a lot since the news came out, one of the reason is I didn't have faith in Bryan Singer. The old X-men trilogy has lots of holes and the First Class had just rounded everything up, and making a time travel movie would've ruin everything once again. But after watching the film tonight my worries vanished and were replaced by hope. It even rounds up better - It gave a new future for the franchise.<br/><br/>I somehow even think this film is made to fix the wrongs by X-Men 3, the last stand, which killed almost every beloved character except the one couldn't die. After TLS the franchise could only do prequels to explore the past, or focus only on the Wolverine who can stand on its own, or them both. The franchise seemed like running out of paths. Now since this film recreated a 'future', at the end of this film, the storyline eventually goes back to somewhere between 1 and 2. After this film, as long as the future sequels to this film keep things in place, the franchise will get a fresh start and could do anything possible due to this time-has-changed plot without a reboot that would force fans to say good-bye to all the beloved moments of the past films.<br/><br/>New characters are quite good - including Blink and Quicksilver. Especially the latter, who gave the film most of its laughing moments. And the scene with Quicksilver in its high-speed motion is no doubt going to be one of the greatest examples of using high-speed cameras. Wish them to take part in future installments.<br/><br/>Although I gave this film a 10 stars, I didn't mean it was perfect. It is the same reason I gave 10 stars to The Avengers, because both films take characters from other well-developed films and did them more than justice. The fact that the character inconsistency bugs me all the time. I couldn't say its a goof, as there is a 10-year-gap between this film and First Class, but keep guessing what MIGHT have happened is just an distraction during watching. And there seems to be other unexplained connections between this film and the original trilogy, such as, where are the giant robot things in the first three films?<br/><br/>After all the pros outweighed the cons and I can't wait for more future installments. With a film collection that started 14 years ago, MCU now have a real opponent."
"silntassasin","9","1","1","23 May 2014"," Not only the best x-men film but up there as one of the best superhero films.
","This movie is freaking spectacular. The best x-men movie of all time and also one of the best if not the best superhero movie of all time. Seriously this movie is amazing. The performances are all very compelling especially from standouts such as James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrance and pretty much the whole cast. The movie is smartly written and very emotionally satisfying. The dialogue is smart, funny, compelling, emotional and gets you invested with all the characters. X-Men Days Of Future Past one of the most visually stunning, epic blockbusters ever to grace our screen. Let's hope Apocalypse can live up to the expectations it now must met."
"cwatkinson321","10","1","1","23 May 2014"," Best comic book adaptation
","Definitely the best comic book adaptation with avengers right behind it. From the beginning it makes you feel like the world has actually been destroyed and the 3D is definitely worth the money. The concept of the sentinels copying mutant powers made them so much more interesting and gave some really good effects and fight scenes. The new mutants that were introduced e.g Sunspot, Bishop, Blink and Warpath weren't in the film a lot but they'll obviously be introduced in the next film which is obviously Apocalypse. The film also erased everything done in x-men last stand which was awful and you could really tell that Bryan Singer was back giving us the best film in the trilogy. He brought the old cast and the new cast together really well and I'm not sure whether this was Stewart or Mckellen's last film but I wouldn't be too bothered if it was because James Mcavoy and Michael Fassbender do it so well. <br/><br/>Overall the film had EVERYTHING I wanted from it, even small things like quicksilver hinting his relation to Magneto and loads of other things that only fans of the comics would understand. The after credit scene gave us a little insight to the next film and it was exactly what I was expecting. Can't wait to see the next."
"Jansensation","10","1","1","23 May 2014"," Best non-Marvel studio Marvel film!
","I love Marvel studio super hero films... All of them. I gave Avengers a 10/10, mainly because it's an incredibly well put together entertaining film that successfully collaborated multiple heroes into a film.<br/><br/>With that said, I am one of thousands of Marvel fans who wants to see all marvel character rights go back to Marvel Studios...<br/><br/>But... the X-men films... Which are made by Fox... I have a reservation with. Fox has done a respectable job and I don't mind them handling X-Men... First class reinforce that belief of mine...<br/><br/>But with Days of Future Past... I'm a believer that Fox should keep X-Men (until they mess up anyways). <br/><br/>This film reminded me of the epic sentinels vs Xmen cartoon episodes I watched growing up, it was surreal watching the first 20-30 minutes. It was magnificent!!!<br/><br/>The film never faltered IMO, it was simply a job well done... The characters introduced were memorable, the villains felt invincible and you really feared them and for the Xmen. <br/><br/>If you like action films you need to see this, if you like hero films this is the best hero film since Avengers. Yes, even better than Winter Soldier which was fantastic. It's a can't miss film.<br/><br/>It's a classic and I was shocked how well Fox were able to do it. Acting, pacing, story, characters etc... It's all here and done well.<br/><br/>9.5/10 - Extremely highly recommended."

","DAYS OF FUTURE PAST is the best x men movie, or say at par with X:2 & First class. Thanks to Bryan Singer, who again does a brilliant job in stuffing the entire x men universe. There are a few minor flaws and as expected some under utilized characters. Especially Halle Berry's STORM. But it didn't bothered much since there is truckload of masterclass actors and actresses. Peter Dinklage having blast, Sir Ian McKellen & Patrick Stewart sharing screen together again, James McCoy & Michael Fassbander's rock solid chemistry, Superb Jennifer Lawrence in dynamic action, SCENE STEALING EVAN PETER's Quicksilver (I wished for more of him), and Hugh Jackman's cut short action but acting avatar which was great and suitable. There are more actors who does a fabulous job but the mentioned guys were the most enjoyable of the entire lot. This is the darkest x men movie, even more than the last year's WOLVERINE and it has a solid emotional core attached to it. The time travel plot and the differences between the mutants is executed flawlessly. Visual effects are top-notch but 3D doesn't adds much depth. Background score is fine. On the whole, FUTURE PAST is Great, memorable and a lot enjoyable! Must - watch. 4.5/5<br/><br/>Note:- ""Their is one after credits scene""."
"achyutaghosh","9","1","1","23 May 2014"," Spectacular
","Watching an X-Men movie always felt like putting on a pair of old shoes. They are predictable yet makes for a comfortable viewing. 2011's X-Men: First Class was actually first class, reinvigorating a franchise that had kind of lost its shine. It explored the origins of the mutant superheroes and villains, and a youthful, talented cast multiplied its impact. But what of the actors in the older series? They never achieved any real closure. So out comes Bryan Singer with X-Men: Days of Future Past, which with its past and future backdrop, effectively serves as a bridge between the two different star casts. Two movies for the price of one? Read on.<br/><br/>""So many battles waged over the years... and yet, none like this. Are we destined to destroy each other, or can we change each other and unite? Is the future truly set?"" – Charles Xavier<br/><br/>In the X-Men universe, the future is dystopian. War has erupted between humans and mutants, with the former close to annihilating the latter with their terrible weapon- the Sentinel robots. In addition to shape shifting, the Sentinels unique strengths include locating any mutant, and the ability to absorb and use mutant powers. The mutants do fight back, but it is useless as shown in the first few minutes of the movie. The futility of their actions do highlight the ingenuity of their solution- changing the past, terminator style, to protect the future. The Sentinel robots came into existence on public support because Mystique assassinated its creator, Bolivar Trask, and they gained their shape-shifting abilities from Mystique herself, who was captured. So The Wolverine's consciousness is sent back to his groovy younger self, back in 1973, just before that fateful incident. He has to convince a younger professor Charles Xavier, and Magneto, among others, of the apocalyptic future, and work together to prevent the assassination.<br/><br/>The cast is gargantuan- Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Ellen Page, Shawn Ashmore and Nicholas Hoult reprise their roles with familiarity, while Peter Dinklage as Trask is their pint sized yet towering adversary. The visual effects are spectacular, and for a movie about people with superhuman abilities, the movie though is more about the human in them. The script is witty, the screenplay is tight, the music is apt, and though the premise is ridiculous, anyone stepping into the theater know what X-Men are after all, a figment of our imagination. <br/><br/>Despite Jackman's imposing physique, Lawrence's beauty and Fassbender's charisma, to me though the standout character was Quicksilver (comics) played by American Horror Story's Evan Peters, the Marvel version of The Flash. A smarty-pants, super-speed endowed kleptomaniac (""Prison break? That's illegal, you know""), he probably gets the best sequence in the film shot from his perspective in which everything else in the world moves so slowly- a super slow 3000 frames per second round the room shot while he moves at warp speed to rearrange bullet trajectories among other things. Pity though he disappears after that. If I were to nitpick, I think Bryan Singer has committed the same mistake that he did in Superman Returns- for a movie that is touted as an epic battle for survival, the action is too little. Agreed Magneto gets to lift up a stadium among other things, but unlike the action in Avengers, which left a satisfied feeling, I felt a bit cheated here, wanting more.<br/><br/>In the end though, X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) is entertaining, absolutely reveres its characters and makes the only truth in comic book world- that anything is possible, believable. 9/10"
"sujanfaster","9","1","1","23 May 2014"," Take your brains along. Not popcorn!
","I have always loved the X men franchise. Its always fascinating to see more than 1 super powers in a film. After the ""X men- Last Stand"", the franchisee focused on prequels and sequels(The Wolverine) to connect to this big movie. Bryan Singer back in the director chair gets almost everything right to bring this magnum opus to the big screen.<br/><br/>As the title suggests this film's set in the future, which takes us to the past. In the future, both the human and the mutant species are on the brink of extinction due to a war against very powerful weapons sent on mutants to wipe them off the planet. However Charles Xavier and Magneto find a way to prevent that from happening by sending Wolverine into the past to change those events which lead to this war which mainly focuses on the character Mystique. This time Wolverine also has the challenge to convince the unstable Xavier and Magneto of the past and get their help in doing it. The rest is how it is accomplished and what does it change with respect to the present/future. Yes, its complicated. But its fun and we might have all the answers in the coming Xmen movies.<br/><br/>Though the movie focuses on Hugh Jackman as a lead character, its a different wolverine we see. Not the irresponsible, easygoing but the mentoring. Hugh Jackman with his beast of a body impresses yet again. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique has a meatier role this time and considering the success she's having these days nothing can go wrong for her. James McAvoy, Fassbender, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen give life to their Magneto and Xavier characters in both the timelines. Evan Peters as Quicksilver is an interesting addition.Since its Xmen there are so many characters and its difficult mentioning each one of them.But I personally felt, Peter Dinklage's acting talent was bit underutilized in his role as Dr.Bolivar Trask. <br/><br/>There are some extraordinary action sequences like Quicksilver's ultra speed motion fight, Mystique changing her form on course of the fight and of course some Magneto's powerful scenes.<br/><br/>There are hardly any disappointing moments in the movie and you'll come out of the cinema hall with some answers and a lot of questions.Bryan Singer keeps us on our toes and makes us ready and curious for the next movie."

Fear not, he betters the best mainstream X-Men movie he's done with this one. <br/><br/>I, for one, love 'First Class', and what Vaughn brought to it. When they announced that has-been Singer was returning to helm, I was worried. Well, was I wrong. Sure, it might have perhaps been better with Vaughn in the director's chair (who knows?), but this is one intelligent piece of mainstream cinema that I, for one, will wanna watch once again (the darkness that pervades converted 3D cinema is very much in your face for this outing, and I'd like another viewing, not just for that reason).<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the best outings for Jackman's mutant ever, this one sets up the next one in this universe very cleverly, and yes, far too conveniently as well, but I'm not gonna be the one to complain. Bringing some cool first-time visual aesthetics to the starved sci-fi actioner genre, this one plays like the trend-setting first Matrix movie for the never-too-creatively-bereft superhero cinema, which did need a shot in the arm post the latest Spidey outing, that was shorn of the intellectual edge<br/><br/>With nods to various characters, old and new, and various Easter eggs sprinkled, laying the foundation for upcoming alternate universe tales, this is sheer joy, with my only concern being the way movie studio franchises will now ape the rebooting of each franchise with the same set of characters and actors, and are liable to have eggs on their face more often than not, since this is lightning in a bottle.<br/><br/>The 3D (converted) is pretty good, but it will depend on the projection system in the cinema you choose. All in all, a pretty good time at the movies after 'The winter soldier'. Enjoy!"

","The new X-Men movie sent me skyrocketing into the sky!<br/><br/>I have been an avid fan of the X-Men the Animated Series since it was shown every Friday evening when I was still 9-years old and honestly I've found the previous X-Men films (with the exception of X-Men: First Class and The Wolverine) quite mediocre compared to the stories in the cartoons. I was also kind of disappointed in some of the movies as well, such as X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Now, thanks again to Bryan Singer (Director of X-Men and X-2), the franchise rose to new heights and he finally saved the day in the mutant world.<br/><br/>The plot was superbly and (almost) flawlessly done. The time travel element of the movie stayed quite faithful to its canon. It straightened out certain things in the previous installments of the franchise which was really impressive. It also perfectly tied the prequel and the original series together, creating a full force ensemble. I was really blown away of how the story was told.<br/><br/>The acting was magnificent. Jennifer Lawrence's popularity put Mystique more in the limelight which seems appropriate because her character is pivotal in the film's plot. She did a fantastic job of portraying her role, as always. Hugh Jackman again proved worthy of his character since the first film. James McAvoy did more justice this time of being the younger Professor X. The acting ensemble really was pretty remarkable.<br/><br/>Lastly, the movie redeemed itself from its third film. The special effects were great and the pacing is just right. It sports out random humors which will make the audience chuckle. Also, its explosive ending was just perfect, absolutely perfect. I wouldn't say any spoilers but the ending is really worth seeing, so much refreshing, actually. So those who haven't seen it yet, go see the film. I promise you wouldn't regret it.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was a fun ride from beginning to end. I can't wait to see X-Men: Rise of the Apocalypse in 2016. I'd rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars. #feelingmoviecritic"
"TheLittleSongbird","9","5","12","27 July 2014"," Not only the best of the X-Men films since X2, but manages to be even better
","The first X-Men was a good, fun, well-made start to the series, though with a yet-to-find-its-feet feel. That was found with X2, which turned out to be bigger, darker and even better. X-Men The Last Stand I didn't find quite as terrible as its reputed to be but it was very disappointing and a big step-down, it had its moments like the visuals, some good performances and the action but suffered from too much going on, a script that was sorely lacking and too many characters that were largely underdeveloped and out of character. X Men Origins: Wolverine was just as disappointing and with very similar pros and cons to The Last Stand. The Wolverine was a definite improvement but still had a fair share of flaws. And First Class was excellent. I was hugely excited for Days of Future Past because the cast is such a good one and the return of Bryan Singer promised much. And Days of Future Past didn't disappoint at all. It is a visually very stylish film that has an even darker and more audacious feel than the rest of the films in the series, the special effects are of great quality and everything looks very slick. The score is the best since the one for X2 in terms of memorability and how it fits and the script is the sharpest since X2 as well and is probably the best and most well-balanced script of all the X-Men films put together. There's a bit of humour that is subtle and genuinely funny, not feeling overly-broad or overkill, while there are plenty of suspenseful and emotional parts. Bryan Singer makes a triumphant come-back, the action sequences really thrill especially the battle between past and future X-Men to stop annihilation while the drama resonates. Great also was the quietly powerful tete-a-tete between the two Xaviers. There is a fair bit going on and there are a lot of characters, but the solid pacing, chemistry between the characters/actors and how well everything's balanced in the writing makes the story thrilling yet with plenty of space to allow you to feel emotion, and for the amount of characters there are here a vast majority of the characters have real personality and soul(plus they're treated with respect), something which Last Stand and Origins did not do. The cast are spot on, Hugh Jackman is grizzled and charismatic while bringing the subdued quality he brought to The Wolverine and Jennifer Lawrence is surprisingly good as Mystique(blue is definitely not the warmest colour with her), the transformation sequences are as eye-popping as they were in X2. James McAvoy gives one of his better performances here and Michael Fassbender is suave and calculating. As the older versions of Professor X and Magneto, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen make a welcome return, Stewart is cool and McKellen is menacing yet with a sympathetic quality, Magneto is much more than a one-dimensional villain(a mistake Last Stand made and that the first two films did not). Evan Peters is excellent too as Quicksilver, like how Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler almost stole the show in X2 Peters' Quicksilver almost did here, a definite scene stealer. Nicholas Hoult is fine as Beast and is very well made-up, but Kelsey Grammar for me was a touch better, and Halle Berry gives her, by far, best performance of the series(the only time she really made an impression as Storm, who's also developed best). My only complaint for Days of Future Past is the cop-out ending(outside of the action), other than that it was a brilliant film that was not only the best X-Men film since the second but a big contender for the best of the series. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"Fozzibear","6","5","12","28 May 2014"," Not bad but a top 100 IMDb film? really?
","I cannot believe that the well informed voters on my favourite website decided to give this film a whopping 8.6 out of 10.<br/><br/>Firstly, the whole premise was ripped directly from Matrix, they didn't even bother to rename the sentinels.<br/><br/>Wolverine seems to have to be at the centre of every xmen film despite being, well, dull. <br/><br/>Magneto and Charles have battled do many times on film now that it is tiresome.<br/><br/>The real problem with the whole series is a distinct lack of any real enemy. Magneto seems to flit in and out of his anarchy to suit the plot. I like Fasbender but he was woefully underused in this film, as with the last.<br/><br/>A big set piece at the beginning and then a big doubler at the end with a yaw first of over an hour I between. The film has no pace, no original ideas and the set pieces have all been done before.<br/><br/>Disappointed."
"paul_haakonsen","8","4","9","5 September 2014"," This movie raises the bar for future X-Men movies...
","OK, I have to admit that I am impressed. I am not overly keen on superhero movies, and the previous X-Men movies have been adequate entertainment, sure, but ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" really put all previous X-Men movies to shame.<br/><br/>The storyline here is really well thought through and executed equally well. And whereas the previous movies have been entertaining, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" also gives the audience something to think about. This installment to the series is more than just another action movie, it actually challenges the audience.<br/><br/>As with the previous movies, the cast is impressive, and people are still doing great jobs with their given roles and characters, and that really shows on the screen. Each character did bring something unique to the story and the movie, of course some more than others, especially those around which the story was centered.<br/><br/>I liked the concept idea of having to go back in time to change the future. Granted, there is nothing new in that idea by far, but it was done in a nice way in the movie, and it did start some thoughts. I started to think 'so if they go back in time to change history, what about the events that transpired in all the previous movies?'. But after a bit more thought, then it dawned on me that it was actually genius, because that would mean that the events that happened in the previous movies were all byproducts of the change in history, and what was shown in those movies differed from what actually should have been show. So in that sense, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" does give the audience something to think about.<br/><br/>As for the effects, well it was as with all previous X-Men movies, great and up to date. Lots of really great CGI effects and some great display of interesting mutant abilities. And while Blink did have some interesting power, I couldn't help but notice that somewhere along the line someone had played a bit too much ""Portal"".<br/><br/>Anyway, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is a really entertaining movie and it does justice to all the previous X-Men movies. This particular movie is by far the best in the series so far, and I can highly recommend it, even if you, like me, are not too fond of superheroes."
"costasmarkoglou","6","4","9","4 August 2014"," Good movie, didn't meet my expectations!
","I used to be a pretty big X-Men fan, but after 'X-Men: The Last Stand' i was disappointed. Fortunately, 'X-Men: First Class' was excellent and got the franchise back on the right track. That's why I was really looking forward to 'Days Of Future Past', having high expectations. It turned out the movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.<br/><br/>In 'Days Of Future Past', the X-Men of the future are facing extinction, so they transfer Wolverine's mind back in time to 1973 where he must recruit Professor X and Magneto to stop Mystique from assassinating a human, an act which led humans to start hunting the mutants in the first place, so they can change the future and survive.<br/><br/>On the plus side, for a movie with so many characters it was a nice surprise that all of them felt meaningful and had enough screen time. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, was once again amazing. He doesn't simply portray Wolverine, he IS Wolverine, end of story. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are incredible and the chemistry between them is great. Mystique was a secondary character in the first X-Men movies, but since she is now being played by the amazing Jennifer Lawrence, it was only natural that she would play a big part in the plot and would have more screen time. Honestly, every time she was in a scene you couldn't take your eyes off of her she's just captivating. For me the most surprising character was definitely Quicksilver. He was perfect: cool, fun and with an insanely strong power and the kitchen sequence with him was jaw-dropping. Wish he had more screen time! <br/><br/>Time travel movies are very tricky and unfortunately 'Days Of Future Past' has a lot of holes. The biggest one in my opinion is the ending, which was what bothered me the most. Logan wakes up, the school is up and running again and all the characters that died in the previous movies are alive again. Why do i have a problem with that? Let me explain. Since the school is running and Logan, Storm, Jean and Scott are teachers, that proves that the events of the first X-Men movie did happen. So then why did the events of the 'X-Men: The Last Stand' didn't happen?? From my logical point of view, in the new future either all of the events from the first three X-Men movies should have happened, or none. What i think happened, was that the writers simply wanted to rectify the wrongs that 'X-Men: The Last Stand' made and simply chose to accept that the events of the first X-Men movie happened and then arbitrarily chose to ""delete"" the ""Last Stand"" events, so they can use the characters that were previously dead for future movies. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the thing that i believe the movie lacked the most was some good action scenes. There was A LOT of dialogue in this movie, but very little action. I mean the part where Magneto moved a whole freaking stadium was awesome, but give us some mutants fighting, like ""First Class"" did. As the tension was building up in the past, i was expecting a big showdown between Wolverine and Magneto, or at least between Wolverine and the Sentinels but they never came. Magneto beat Wolverine in 5 seconds and simply sent him flying and the Sentinels didn't really have an important role in that sequence at all.<br/><br/>'Days Of Future Past' left me a bittersweet taste. Great plot, amazing actors and characters, but poor action and arbitrary ending. With these actors and budget i believe they can do much better, hope the next X-Men movie called ""Apocalypse"" meets our expectations."
"j-madej","9","4","9","21 May 2014"," Once again director Bryan Singer delivered goods in arguably the greatest X-MEN movie to date in the ""X-MEN Days of Future Past""!
","Once again director Bryan Singer delivered goods in arguably the greatest X-MEN movie to date in the ""X- MEN Days of Future Past""! Yes indeed, this installment feels like a bridge between the characters and their stories in the past and the future. Made with the estimated budget of $250,000,000 this film needs to make 3 times its cost to be profitable. $750,000,000 to be exact, or more and I believe, judging by an early reviews, it will be one of the most profitable movies of this year. Everything is bigger and better here in all departments. This is the best of Wolverine we've have ever seen. Finely Jackman grew in to his character he embodied in the passed, however now less with rage more so with brute, masculine strength. His veins are practically popping out everywhere on his body. But just because Wolverine has an important part in this story doesn't mean that he hijacked the whole movie in terms of the performance. All the lead actors in their super hero characteristics bring something unique to the table in terms of charisma, otherwise they wouldn't have been casted in the first place, but in ""X-MEN Days of Future Past"" Bryan Singer, Simon Kinberg and writer of the story Jane Goldman let other lesser known X-MEN take the stage in the battle for the future of all men kind and mutants. The ultimate X-Men ensemble fights a war for the survival of the species across two time periods in X-Men: Days of Future Past. The characters from the original X-Men film trilogy join forces with their younger selves from X-Men: First Class in an epic battle that must change the past - to save our future. The X-Men send Wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants. There is a lot to like here in terms of character development from all the actors both in the past as well as the future. Apart from the old characters we know form the previous films like Wolverine/ Hugh Jackman, Professor X/Patrick Stewart, Magnito/Ian McKellen, Storm/Halle Berry we have a newcomers like Nicholas Hoult playing the Beast and of course Michael Fassbender playing Erik Lehnsherr the younger version of Magnito end emotional James McAvoy as the young and still walking Charles Xavier. Next to Jackman person who quietly steals the movie for me is Raven / Mystique Jennifer Lawrence who practically steals every scene she is in, not only because most of the story plot depends on her character path being good or turning bad or that she is practically naked not counting the blue tight costume she embodies, but in this film we see more of her inner self that till now was not so overexposed. In 1973 her blood will be used to create special robotic machines made by men called the Sentinels that 50 years from then will be the deciding apocalyptic point of the extinction of the world as we know it. The balance between both time frames is handled very well here and keeps viewer in constant state of entertainment in terms of character development going back and forward respectively. I think all the little historical references like Magnito's jail arrest in Pentagon for being accused of killing JFK, or scenes with president Richard Nixon as an example, give the whole story, the additional dimension of historical reference making it more enjoyable and original. The action scenes are full of CGI, but it looks like the money here was spend well, due to the impressive visual scope. Specially the scene of the breakout of Magneto from the Pentagon by our heroes, including the new super fast mutant by the name of Quicksilver (comedically refreshing Evan Peters). That scene is shot brilliantly is super slow-motion were director Bryan Singer filmed Quicksilver's scenes in a special format of 3600 frames a minute. This means that Quicksilver will be moving 1500 times faster than normal running around the room disarming people in instant. Awesome! That scene in itself is worth the 3D admission ticked! From what I have read Bryan Singer will both direct and produce another X-MEN movie set to start production in 2016 titled ""X-Men: Apocalypse"". From the quality of this X-MEN installment I reckon this franchise is in good hands.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique"
"donb-519-335075","3","3","6","10 February 2015"," It's all my fault
","Prior to watching the latest edition of this very popular series, I put the curse of death on the movie: ""I have enjoyed every X-Men movie, this has to be good."" OOPs - sorry - from that point on the movie did not have a chance.<br/><br/>Granted, back to the future/time travel movies are confusing anyway, but this one was a mess.<br/><br/>So let's briefly summarize what was going on in the plot: Giant super robots are killing the mutants - so far so good. They are arriving in the present (around 2023) in flying coffins - and the mutants (Wolverine, Scott, Storm - the usual suspects) are alarmed because they know they (our good favorite mutants) cannot kill the bad robots - because we have seen them do it. And how did this happen? In the past - (1973 to be exact) Mystique killed the evil dwarf Dr. Trask who was developing the giant killer robots and since he was gone, the program went forward (I guess in his memory.)<br/><br/>So - let's (X-Men) send somebody back to 1973 to stop Mystique from killing the evil dwarf and all will be fine. So who can do this? - naturally Wolverine (any body who can hop up and down for over three minutes ought to be equal to this simple task.) Well, Wolverine goes back to 1973. And here is where the movie really missed the mark. The 79's were so bizarre that Wolverine could have had many humorous clashes with the culture. (Did you ever see I love the 70's?) But all they did was play Roberta Flack on the radio - a missed opportunity to save the movie.<br/><br/>Oh yes - both Magneto and Dr. Charles Xavier (Cougat?) send him back to stop Mystique. Naturally one of his biggest challenges will be to convince the young Erik (Magneto) and Xavier - in the past - to help Wolverine stop Mystique. They say they have not matured their powers yet (in the past), but then display them in all their glory later (later in the past)- oops another messy plot deal.<br/><br/>So Wolverine stumbles around in 1973 - and the final scene (the assassination of the dwarf) climaxes with (young) Magneto pulling a stadium (Redskins Stadium? - oops politically insensitive name - sorry) from the ground and surrounding the White House with it. Then Magneto pulls a black box containing the President and his staff (+ the dwarf) from under the Oval Office - rips the door off - and Richard Nixon comes forward to be sacrificed instead of the rest of mankind. What? Also it is revealed that JFK was a mutant (I always knew there was something strange about that guy.)<br/><br/>And the actor playing Richard Nixon looked more like Lady Bird Johnson than Nixon!! They could have just put one of those Nixon Halloween masks on the actor and been more convincing.<br/><br/>The best line in the movie was almost at the end when one of the characters looks up and says ""What in the hell is going on?"" Too bad they did not get a Vince Lombardi look-alike for that line..<br/><br/>Now, I read some of the reviews which hysterically gushed over the movie: ""Best X-Men yet!"" (Maybe they did not see any of the other movies.) This just shows that the world is full of different people with different tastes and desires. Believe it or not, there are some people who liked 3 Days to Kill!! (well not really, I was just trying to be charitable.)<br/><br/>Ooh - one other good thing - at the beginning one of the mutants displayed his unique power - the power to make people puke on demand - pretty cool - pretty good power. How much can you really do to someone when you are puking?<br/><br/>I didn't hate it, I was just sad that the X-Men series had fallen to this depth.<br/><br/>I'm sure we will see more of the X-Men - I'm just not sure I am up to any more of this. My apologies for jinxing this one."
"libbylefty85","10","3","6","28 August 2014"," AWESOME movie, with vague reference to APOCALYPSE
","I absolutely LOVE this movie! It's chock full of action, adventure, comedy, and heart-warming moments. I thought it was brilliant that they tied in the JFK assassination conspiracy, and that there was a subtle hint of Magneto being Quicksilver's father (when he told Magneto that his mother knew someone who could do things with metal). Also, Quicksilver could be seen later in the movie holding his little sister (a young Scarlet Witch). And, the spoiler at the very end was interesting... the scene with a young boy manipulating objects to build the pyramids in ancient Egypt, with 4 hooded figures on horses watching him in the distance. Looks like a young Apocalypse with his 4 horsemen... Can't wait for the next one! One thing that was not explained at all... How was Professor X alive in the futuristic beginning? Last we saw of him, he'd been killed by Phoenix. How did he come back to save the future???"
"mattkratz","9","3","6","13 August 2014"," outstanding
","This was an outstanding entry in the X-Men/Marvel Comics series of movies. The only disappointment:no cameo by Stan Lee! The movie centers around an assassination on a scientist 50 years earlier by Mystique/Raven, which will lead to an attack and subsequent war with android-like characters called the Sentinels. The war is very devastating. The solution-send one of them back in time to prevent the assassination, and that someone turns out to be Wolverine. (Doesn't this remind you a bit of the Terminator?) He tracks down the younger versions of the Mutants and makes an attempt to thwart the assassination.<br/><br/>This movie features superb action, characters, special effects, and surprises.

I like how it manages to go from the dark future where everything is about to be torn to pieces to its origin in the past.<br/><br/>I also love all the new characters this movie brings to the x men franchise (like Blink, Bishop, Quicksilver and more) while continuing with the all ready great characters from the previous movies.

"bobcolganrac","7","3","6","28 May 2014"," Not So Great
","Special effects in XMDOFP are amazing as we've come to expect from modern big screen 3D bonanzas.<br/><br/>But the story line is weak. <br/><br/>And that's why I can't rate this movie higher. It just doesn't cut the cerebral mustard. Unsatisfying to me, in the end....I wanted it to be more, and it didn't deliver it. But I am certain that to other viewers it was quite satisfying. <br/><br/>It's a well done piece of cinema.<br/><br/>The movie plot borrows from a number of others (Star Trek '09, Inception, The Matrix, Terminator 2) . . . and wasn't consequently that original. This is too bad. Given the budget and acting talent they had they could have come up with something a little more interesting ...and they should have.<br/><br/>I believe Singer was aspiring to achieve a genuine comic book look....and the attacks of the Sentinels with energy of all kinds being thrown around, he succeeded. However, it was for me too much of a good thing....I found them a bit too weird. Still, the CGI special effects are on a par with the best that have been done. Amazing. Fantastic choreography on the fighting sequences. The movie thrives on such action.<br/><br/>(I think it worth noting that people no longer refer to them as 'computer generated' but just 'special effects' ----the ineluctable transition toward seamless Singularity apparently on schedule) I will say that Quicksilver's actions were to my thinking the best of the movie----the scene in the kitchen of the Pentagon where he takes out all the guards and redirects the plastic bullets by first running around at warp speed: absolutely great ! A Great scene ! Quicksilver is now my favorite mutant!!<br/><br/>Acting is topnotch. I cannot think of a poor character rendition in this....Michael Fassbender playing the young Magneto shows once again why he is one of today's very elite cinema faces....he has a power to hold the camera, to capture the viewer's attention---the mark of a great actor. It's a high-octane cast, and they deliver.<br/><br/>The final plot development didn't work. Magneto's dramatic ""relocation"" of the sports stadium seemed odd-----visually novel, but a strangely over-the-top ploy that seemed unnecessary. If he was trying to make a statement, he could have done it by other, less excessive means. Maybe I just don't understand how Magneto's mind works.....maybe it's me. Probably.<br/><br/>I was hoping to be blown away by this movie....at least really pleasantly surprised by it. And I wasn't. Held back by a plot that could have been a hair stronger. Again, very good, but not great. 7.75, could we use fractions."

","This is a grand long stuffed full of characters movie which will satisfy fans but can try the patience at times.<br/><br/>Some scenes in this movie are good like the slowing down of time take down with Peter and Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) speaking Vietnamese. <br/><br/>This movie has a lot of characters new and old - some only get a few minutes of screen time. Hard to identify the new ones. Peter Dinklage with his distinctive voice is quite a good addition. Fan Bing Bing is more or less silent but pretty. Hugh Nicholas James and Michael are all quite good and convincing.<br/><br/>The logic defying time traveling story needs some concentration and pre knowledge of the other movies. I liked X Men First Class for it's historical setting and this one has a some with the Vietnam context. Nixon is quite well done. All the fighting and then it didn't happen feel like a waste of time. In the end I didn't really care which character was trying to stop which one and was quite glad it was over.<br/><br/>Overall die hard fans will be happy but for moderate fans it's a bit trying at times.

","where to start.... <br/><br/>i'll begin with this; the X-Men Series has been a mixed boat when it comes to movies, they have had their highs( like the first two X-men's and Arguably First Class) and their lows (Last stand, and Origins). So i was Sceptical when i had heard that they were making a new X-Men Movie i was torn on how i could feel about it, i loved First class but after hearing that it was going to include not just the first class cast, but the original cast as well, it heightened my Scepticism even further given that it was two huge cast's put together, but as the months pressed on, the anticipation grew and faith was slowly building for this movie.<br/><br/>And shall i say, it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Character wise, there is a lot of people to talk about. so ill keep it simple, each has their own part of this magnificent machine, and they all did their parts brilliantly, From the opening scene till the end, it was just amazing to see how well a movie can handle such a large cast, and not make it feel like it was just a bunch of extra's.<br/><br/>What surprised me the most about this movie was that it in a lot of way's fixed what had hurt the other's, the Script was pure Genius with intertwining the old and new cast, the old and new movies, and just delivering everything it needed to right. the balance of story, and action was done beautifully. they way the powers were interpreted was just phenomenal.<br/><br/>there was a few questions that rose during the movie ****(SPOILER)*****, what happened to Eric (magneto) when the future was changed? most likely we will find out in X- Men:Apocalypse.<br/><br/>and also, now that we have this movie in place, Which cast will be in the next movie?<br/><br/>Only time will tell. all in all though this movie had delivered where it needed to and just was a great movie.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of people will give this movie flack for not Following the Comic like it should (example being that Kitty Pryde is supposed to go back not wolverine) but to be honest the changes were made where they needed it to be. beside's they aren't making these comic book movies for just the comic readers, it's to make it appeal to everyone.<br/><br/>i was absolutely blown away by the amazing writing and acting in this movie, i would go see it again and again and again. it had raised the bar for sure when it comes to comic book movies, it is definitely in my top three Comic book movies. <br/><br/>if you have been considering going to see this movie. you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>and the after credit scene.... ill just say this... absolutely phenomenal."

Nevertheless i urge you to watch it anyway because this movie is all about the POWERS and how the x-men use them. And they use them very well (BLINK AND QUICKSILVER being my favorites). Quicksilver does amazing things when saving his father listening to the immortal tunes of Jim Croce (i promise you will like this scene). Magneto shows an amazing control of his powers and an even darker side of his character. Special effects were stunning (as they should be with a budget like that), but i did not notice much of the 3D effects that should be associated with a 3D movie (never blinked once). Any way i very much enjoyed the film but left the theater wanting a little bit more action (and a bit more closeups of Mystique during her acrobatics). Thumbs up for this one Bryan."
"thealphakeno","9","3","6","21 May 2014"," Best X-men Movie of all but still need more time to explain things.
","X-men: Days of Future Past is the newest installment of the X-men series, occurring after the events of both X-men: First Class and The Wolverine. As a fan, I'm so pump to see the film but before they finished the whole thing, there's been a lot of changes as they film it, which made me, think twice on the outcome of the whole film.<br/><br/>It was a perfect film with 95% of rating. A truly masterpiece with lots of actions and amazing effects. There are just some flaws that I couldn't ignore as a fan.<br/><br/>First of all was the removing of Anna Paquin's character Rogue. She is the main reason I really wanted to see the film. But when they cut her major scene and put her as a cameo, it really breaks my heart. She appeared in the film for 3 seconds. She smiled and walks away with Iceman. THAT'S ALL. While on the other hand, Jean Grey and Scott appears to and has a minimum of 2 minutes with dialogue in the film. In my part, it was unfair. Two of them died in the previous movie. Rogue survived and has only one scene but yet they ditch her.<br/><br/>Second was the explanation on how Professor X survives/reborn after his death on X-men: The Last Stand. I didn't notice if they explained it but I'm pretty sure there is no exact explanation about it. <br/><br/>Third and last was the explanation on how Kitty gains time travelling power? I'm going to buy it if it's Rogue become the main facilitator of the time travel. But Kitty? Phasing is not related to Time travelling. <br/><br/>Furthermore, I enjoy the film. 2 hours is not enough for me. Blink's portals are awesome!; Sunspot's power works well with the effects, just too bright like the sun and not darker like in comics; and Warpath, trust me, no one noticed he could fly but more like fighter, but still amazing. I have lots of question that needs to be explained through deleted scenes and interviews but moreover, I can assure you that you will enjoy the movie from start to finish."

","This movie is simply amazing for every single fan of action and science fiction movies!!! Not only it has very good acting and of course one of the Hollywood's best VFX but it also has emotion, great plot and most of all amazing scenario!!! <br/><br/>It starts in the events after all the Xmen movies happened and it drives you back, about 10 years after the ""Xmen-First class""'s events happened. The events in the movie itself are very well organized and shown in a way that it sets the bar for more future Xmen movies. I believe this is the only way of keeping the series much enjoyable and still very long since there are so many movies of its kind already. A genius refresh! !!!Spoilers in the next sentence!!!<br/><br/>The fact that in the end everything has changed and all the previous Xmen movies ""do not matter"" isn't true. That's because the memories of the past in the other time line still exists and these are the ones that made all this great correction possible. And of course, who knows what we are going to see in future sequels to this.<br/><br/>Please watch this movie! It's one of these movies you can't simply miss."
"ebonize_christian","10","4","10","10 September 2014"," The best so far
","I first have to say I love the X-Men movies. This movie starts off with a lot of action. The scene is shortly cut to the facts. While it does get a little far-fetched it stays close to the storyline. And then we're off to the story and it does get a little slow paced. But then you learn a lot about the characters. this part of the story does touch the heart of the characters. Hugh Jackman doesn't play the hero so much as the pawn to push the real heroes into a right choices. The action will have you on the edge of your sits unto the very end. the story tends to get a little hectic but within time it will come to a big finale. and there will be a plot twist."
"leplatypus","4","4","10","27 July 2014"," future adaptation of my past comics (screen)
","I can't understand why comics and movies can't be one and the same nowadays.<br/><br/>Here, the divorce starts with the movie poster: for those who have Byrne's cover in mind, the awful art and meaningless composition used for promoting this adaptation is a disappointment: if you can understand what the movie is about, you are then a genius.<br/><br/>Logically, the movie is in the same vein as its poster: instead to adapt Claremont's gripping drama (by the way, he has a cameo as a member of the panel!) and put Byrne's drawings in live action, the movie decides to do its own (bad) way by telling a new complicated story and using awful new design (a bit like the disastrous remake of « the earth stood still »). <br/><br/>To resume, all the future time-line is crap: sentinels are ugly, Shadowcat is telepathic and worst of all, the X-men are well alive: all the power of the original story was built on the fact that Rachel Summers and Kitty were the only one living so that their mission just couldn't fail. By the way, by changing all those essential parameters, the movie also erases the big paradox of the comics: As the daughter of Scott and Jean, how could the past in which Rachel is sent was one in which she isn't born yet and her mother has been already killed: If you remember Doc Brown's lessons, you know that it can't happen.<br/><br/>The present time-line is much better but it's the direct follow-up of the previous movie. So if you don't have seen it (like me), you will be a bit lost as it's a really unexpected team roaster for X-men (Wolvie, Magneto, Xavier, Beast and Mystique). In addition, the finale wasn't really exciting as it was very similar to the finales of all previous movies. <br/><br/>In fact, the movie is only good in its first part, from the arrival of Wolvie to the summit in Paris. The 70s were coolly done and Quicksilver was the only one mutant really used to his potential.<br/><br/>As I have already written about «Thor », Hollywood really doesn't understand comics: They are poor writers who think that big special effects are visual achievement !"

","I fell asleep. Yes, I actually fell asleep during this nonsensical mish mosh of a movie. I don't know that I've actually ever fallen asleep in a movie theater before, except one time when I had just got off a 10 hour flight and went to a movie to try to stay awake to avoid jet lag. Fail! <br/><br/>But back to this one. If you like a movie with intelligence, a coherent plot, characters you can care about and great acting.... don't bother going to see X-Men: Days of Future Past. Really. Just don't waste your time. <br/><br/>About the only good thing in this movie was the guy playing Nixon. The whole opening sequence and its matching sequence later in the movie is a chaotic mess where you have no clue really of what's going on.

"Hitchcoc","10","4","10","30 May 2014"," Superb, Even for Those of Us Who Are a Little in the Dark
","I've seen them all because my son and I like to go to these big movies. Every time one comes out, I've forgotten who's who and what's what. This is of a different generation. What I see here is masterful storytelling, dynamic characters whose purpose isn't just to beat to a pulp or incinerate their opponents, but a culture that has developed around mutations at war with the people for whom they are saviors. Time travel can be quite touchy and this needs to be treated with kid gloves. The story begins in the present where things have gone badly for the recurring characters and their ilk. A race of killer robots has been launched against them and it becomes necessary for them to find a way to mutate time in order to prevent the killing of a man who has used the DNA a of Mystique to create these devils. Wolverine is chosen to go back because he is the one most capable of withstanding the perils of the trip. He must get a group the mutants to act on faith since they have no idea who he is. So much has been written, so what I will say that what follows is an amazing series of scenes filled with tension, humor, and clever intricacies of plot. There is a scene where a football stadium is uprooted and brought down around the White House (Nixon's White House) and used a prison enclosure. I will leave the long dramatic explanations of events to others. I really enjoyed this film."

"Ucare","4","5","14","28 May 2014"," Absolutely the worst X-Men till now.
","Slow, too much boring bla bla (of the bad one, just emotional stereotypes) and way too few action. I do not go to watch X-Men to see cheap Rhetoric, I go to see epic fights, special powers, amazing characters. I was not moved nor excited not even for a second. All what happens is very predictable, the characters are few, and all what happens is about Charles, Magneto, Mystique, and the omnipresent Wolverine. Always them. BORING. Just a few new interesting characters on the future side of the story, which only the connoisseurs can enjoy, because there is absolutely no introduction and their appearance is relegated into few short weak scenes. I think this Movie shows clearly that X-Men became a a sort of TV Series, just in the Cinema. Here the writers sacrificed an entire Movie to the ""development"" (=low level stereotypical) of the personality of a couple of characters, cutting away action, epic, speed, diversity, news, etc. Problem is that this is a Movie, not an episode of a TV Series (which you have to wait a week to see the next one), a Movie for which people had to wait years, as they will have to wait before the next. The writers are going in circles. Nowhere."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","3","7","9 September 2014"," Way too convoluted and often baffling, but thoroughly entertaining anyway.
","People walked out of Days of Future Past with one phrase on their lips; ""definitely the best X- Men movie."" With our market over-saturated with Marvel and there being 6 other X-Men movies in the last 15 years, does that sentence really mean anything? Does that make it something of worthy value to cinema? I just wanted to know if it was good on a scale of all movies. The answer is no, but a mild no, I'm still partial to X-Men 2, but while Days of Future Past was entertaining, it's very flawed. First problem is that it doesn't have a first act, it just dives straight in after a huge cringeworthy exposition dump. It's a totally clunky introduction which followed one of their best action sequences in a long time.<br/><br/>It takes a long time to sink back into the narrative after a series of painfully bad dialogue that shows a complete lack of confidence. At times it's just way too convoluted, but that might be just because I haven't watched any X-Men movie since First Class and I'm rusty. There's a lot of chronology where I'm not sure what's changed or fixed or whatever. The problem is that the antagonistic force requires a big suspension of disbelief that I'm not prepared to give. It's a film very derivative of its inspirations and in particular in that regard, The Matrix. But predictability aside, it has some very involving and colourful action scenes that make up for any moments where I'm lost.<br/><br/>Mutant fighting is always a joy to watch and Fassbender and McAvoy prove their worth as Magnetic and Professor X. I could take or leave the Quicksilver stuff but I get why he's popular. However, the film does do a great job at raising the stakes with a tiny shot of emotional resonance in its biggest moments and I think that's partly why the film works much better than other blockbusters this year, even if its first act misstep shoots itself in the foot. I guess it depends on the backstory from the other movies but I can't quite figure out at what point it's entering from. Days of Future Past is just real easy to watch with plenty of lights (aka crowded with characters) buzzing at once to keep you occupied for two hours. We know what worse looks like anyway.<br/><br/>6/10"
"tristanwiggill80","6","3","7","29 May 2014"," X Men First Class was better...
","All I can say is that I expected more! The hype for this really made me believe that Days of Future Past was going to top the last film: First Class. I found it to be average. How is this listed under IMDb's Top 250. The plot = relatively average. On the bright side the few action scenes( excluding those from the ""future"") were pretty good, but nothing amazing.I really enjoyed X Men: First Class, but this one made me lose faith in Summer Blockbusters again. It's not a bad film at all, the performances were good and the dialogue, not bad, but this movie suffers from being too ordinary and with movies like the Avengers on such an epic scale the Xmen franchise needs to up its game!"

","I've had more heroic poops than ""X-Men: Days of Future Past.""<br/><br/>Where to begin? Am I the only one who thinks Hugh Jackman is getting a little long in the shorts to play Wolverine? At this stage of the game he would be better off in an episode of ""The Crotch Chronicles."" As for the rest of the high-powered cast, may their next film have ""X"" in the title not because it's a sequel, but because they'll have been banished from Hollywood and forced to make the naughty motion pictures!<br/><br/>I caught this one at an early screening and everyone in the audience walked away looking like Robert Hegyes after catching the red eye. They found themselves actively rooting against the time travel plot, the Croation-looking special effects and the overall sense of poopiness. One child cried as the beans spilled out of his hand.<br/><br/>You've got to give Bryan Singer a lot of credit. The man is the directorial equivalent of Bull from ""Night Court.""

","The story isn't bad, but the characters and acting are awful.<br/><br/>The core group - Xavier, Magneto, Wolverine, Raven/Malice, even Storm are fine. But the rest - either the character or actor, or both, are awful. Half the cast is like something from a weekend cosplay convention.<br/><br/>Bad Characters - Talk about generic people and generic powers. There's the cold guy, surfing around on ice. There's the hot guy, firing flame all over the place. For some reason, Sentinel hot stolen from hot guy trumps cold guy powers, and Sentinel cold stolen from cold guy trumps hot guy powers. They're just examples of generic characters or lame characters - there's one guy whose power is to make people throw up. There's not a lot of thought into how many of these people use their powers. It's like watching a bunch of video game players poorly express powers in generic ways.<br/><br/>Bad Acting - Halle Berry is a bad actress. She's wooden. But at least she is natural - she just doesn't express much emotion. Half the cast doesn't appear natural when delivering lines. If Halle Berry makes you look bad, then you're really bad.<br/><br/>Many of the actors and actresses in this movie pose their lines. They also make weird body motions when they express their powers - the flail arms down, head tilt, shoulder shrug, or hard nod forward. Wolverine throws his hands down when he extends his claws, but he makes it look natural. The bad ones, and there are many of them, don't make it look good.<br/><br/>The fights are decent, if a little generic. The plot is weak.<br/><br/>This is only a good superhero movie to people who think special effects are all that counts."

","In the future, the world is devastated by constant war. Sentinels are robots created to hunt mutants. Xavier and Magneto team up with a plan to change history. Kitty Pryde sends Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) 50 years into the past to 1973. He has to find Xavier (James McAvoy), free Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and recruit them in a mission to stop the Sentinel program before it starts. They have to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) who tries to kill weapons designer Trask (Peter Dinklage).<br/><br/>This is a compelling sci-fi thriller achieving one of the most seamless transition from an old cast to the new. The story is terrific. It introduces Quicksilver as a fresh injection of fun. That's probably the only minor complaint. It needs a bit more fun to offset the serious tones. It's not really a complaint. OK! Forget about it. The new cast is set to take off in place of the old."
"RobertHouse","3","2","4","11 November 2014"," X-Men: Disappointment of Future and Past
","This movie was a huge disappointment for me because it felt like a filler movie (A movie that is not needed/created just for monetary purposes/contributes nothing to the story of the preceding movies) The movie had great visuals and seeing all the mutants together in the same film was amazing, but that is not why I see movies nor do I encourage anyone to do so.<br/><br/>I enjoyed The Wolverine movie, but did not enjoy this. Sitting through this movie felt like a chore. Several parts were not needed and it felt like it was dragged on way too long. I think the part where Magneto was moving the stadium was dragged on far too long. Parts like these make me believe that if Wolverine was really time traveling during a battle that he would easily be captured or killed considering how long he was taking. I understand he was not time traveling in another part of the universe like in the movie Interstellar so the time should correlate with the present time.<br/><br/>The other parts of the movie I did not like were how the movie presented the mutants as arrogant a-holes that have superpowers. They were so arrogant that they didn't even have sympathy for a fellow mutant. I understand that this was before the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, but still is this the only two things the mutants have in common with each other?"
"AB-Crawford","6","2","4","18 October 2014"," Days of Past Future Present Now Then Soon
","First off, I know it's a fiction movie about people with super powers. But the story still has to make some sense. <br/><br/>The only redeeming quality to the movie is the special effects and actions scenes. The acting is wooden. The dialog is mediocre. And the total premise of the story simply doesn't work or make any sense. <br/><br/>I had already heard about continuity problems but I tried to overlook them. I couldn't and it really took away from the experience. The frequent flashes between Logan in the past and the future battle between the X-Men and the Sentinels doesn't make a bit a sense. Had Logan been successful in the past, that time line would have ceased the moment he went back. Had he failed, then he would have failed and the Sentinels would have killed them all. That dual battle showing the past and future battles was lazy, uninspired writing. <br/><br/>I also thought Singer went out of his way to take shots at the movies/directors since his last X-Men movie. Last Stand killed off Jean Grey and Cyclops - nope, altered time line changes that. Logan loses his Adamantium claws in The Wolverine - nope, changed that and provided no explanation. In First Class, Charles is paralyzed in 1962 - nope, taking a shot now that makes his legs work. <br/><br/>Overall, I have to think this was just a platform to get both casts together and not near enough effort went into writing a good and believable story."

"akshay_94","6","2","4","19 August 2014"," Written in the past
","When you go to watch this movie, don't buy popcorn at first. Instead buy it sometime in the future, travel back to that very moment and gift yourself the popcorn. I implemented this strategy and ended up watching the movie on an empty stomach. The point of this exercise? Nothing, just as the senseless time travel shown in the film. This much anticipated installment in an otherwise brilliant series will leave you disappointed. That is, unless you choose not to strain your brain and just accept the events as they are. The film opens in a dark and desolate future that was set in motion in 1973, when brilliant scientist Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) created a series of giant robots called Sentinels for the sole purpose of wiping out mutants, whom he claimed were a direct threat to the human race. Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) devise a plan to have Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to the year when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Trask -- it turns out that Mystique inadvertently accelerated the Sentinel program when she was subsequently captured by Sgt. William Stryker (Josh Helman), who succeeded at harvesting her DNA to make the robots more powerful than ever before. Upon arriving in the past, Wolverine sets out to change the future. In the end, the viewers are left hanging with a dilemma about the fate of the dystopian future world. It seems as if it never existed. However, if it didn't exist, none of the events in the movie would have occurred in the first place. There are plenty of other loopholes and inconsistencies that will constantly bug an observant viewer. The movie also leaves some open questions, which I hope will be resolved in the future. For example, where does a mutant who can walk through walls (Kitty) get the power to transport people back in time? How did Wolverine get his metal claws back in the future, given that he lost them in the fifth installment? How did Xavier survive the violent disintegration previously seen in the series? On the bright side, some well directed action scenes, especially when Quicksilver saves everyone in slow motion, provides the much needed excitement one expects from an X-Men film. Towards the end, all you can hope is for the next installment, X Men: Apocalypse to be much more sensible, thrilling and satisfying than this movie."
"Rage-Kage","10","2","4","31 May 2014"," A way to reboot the series without actually rebooting it
","I've always been a big fan of the X-Men movies but I have never read the comics. So that being said I didn't hate X3 or Origins like most everybody else though I do have to admit they were definitely the weakest in the series. I was pretty excited for this new installment in the franchise especially after I started hearing some of the early reviews. I loved X-Men First Class and was really excited to see the cast of that movie and the original cast come together in one movie and this movie did not disappoint.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was all around great. I love the actors that were chosen to play the younger versions of the characters from the original series. Michael Fassbender in particular is just perfect for young magneto. Every time he is on screen even in first class when he was more of an hero or anti- hero there was an ominous feeling surrounding him. James McAvoy is also great as young Charles Xavier. I love how after First Class they have managed to further humanize the character. I personally like Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique a lot more then Rebecca Romijn Like with James McAvoy I just feel like she does a good job humanizing the character. Thats not to say that I think that Patrick Stewart and Rebecca Romijn did a bad job because they both did really good as well. I like Nicholas Hoult as Beast for the same general reasons I like the other younger characters and sense I already mentioned the humanizing thing a few times I'll just leave it at that and of course Wolverine was awesome as always.<br/><br/>Some of the best action in this movie takes place in the future with the original cast. The future sentinels were great villains and really the first time in the X-Men movie series where there was a real sense of hopelessness when facing down an unbeatable enemy. Part of me wants to say that the future characters were a little underused but overall I think that for what the movie was they were in it for a good amount of time. The past had some great action to though. For example Magneto floating in the air carrying an entire stadium is definitely a highlight in the movie. Anytime Wolverine starts killing people with those claw bone or metal it really doesn't matter it's always cool. I also really like watching Beast fight I think its cool to watch the ways he fights much more like an animal then any human<br/><br/>I think that its really cool the way they have kind of rebooted the series without actually rebooting it by changing the time line. The writers did a great job with the time travel aspect of the story which has proved to be something that is really hard to do in other movies. I'm not saying that there were no holes in the plot what so ever but I think they will probably keep fixing some of the continuity errors as more movie in the series are released in the future so I'm not to worried about any plot holes.<br/><br/>Overall I really liked this movie and don't have any complaints<br/><br/>So I'm giving X-Men Days of Future Past a 10/10"

","For the most part. ""X-men - Days of future past"" is as great as everyone is saying. Bringing together all the best elements, of a film series that has sometimes struggled to win everyone over. Its brilliantly realised, clever, and funny in the right places.<br/><br/>Now, its not like the X-men are up there with Super-man, Batman, and Spider-man, as the most renowned of all the superhero's, and I personally feel these films have had a harder time than most, in being criticised on how they don't do justice to all of the characters. Now, me personally. Have kind of liked all of these movies (With the exception of maybe ""X-men â€“ Origins"") but they're all not without their faults. Except ""Days of future past"" almost manages it, and came very close to being the best of the series. A Film that I was almost going to give 5 stars.<br/><br/>The Film does what the likes of ""X-men 2"" still did best. By throwing all of these powers these people have at the screen in inventive ways, while also giving the characters human drama, and a proper story to play off. Despite the films brave and winning attempt at throwing more of these ""mutants"" together than ever. It really all comes down to a young professor X's struggle with faith, when the likes of Michael Fassbender, and Jennifer Lawrence turned on him in the last movie.<br/><br/>But the icing on the cake is the eye catching special effects. Bringing together 2 different visual styles. One of a dark future, and one of a colourful 70's together. In a way that is perhaps (Can't believe I'm going to say this) done even further justice by great 3D.<br/><br/>So what's bad about it then? Well, In short, I hated the ending. It was one of those endings that actually almost ruined the whole movie. After doing such a good job off entertaining me for over 2 hours, and single handedly letting me forget/forgive this series terrible continuity problems (by nicely working around the main one) the ending just screws things up all over again, in a way that will make little sense to even the biggest of ""Time travel movie"" fans. Still, I guess I can understand why they ended it the way they did. Even if it does seem completely mad."

I'm saying that you can't have a film that scraps acting just so you can have some puffed up sex bots That strutting and fretting their hour upon the stage, and then are heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, to paraphrase good old Shakespeare. He, too, pandered to the ""lower class,"" but the difference between Shakespeare and most of these Block Busters is CLASS. Shaky had class. Most people in Hollywood don't. <br/><br/>So fellow movie lovers... let us attempt to refrain from BUYING these dullard films full of action sans-acting. Purchase a ticket for a movie like X-Men... Go see X-men... and if you still want to see your brainless Block Buster, hop on over after you've seen X-men... WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT. Because we need to stop this dreadful trend. Brilliant films seem to be far and wide these days... Unless they're independent and/or foreign and either can't afford or just plain don't get advertised. <br/><br/>Sorry that this wasn't exactly a review, but it's my opinion regarding the greatness of this film as compared to the slop that we willingly watch which turns our brains into just that.... slop. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading."

","Me personally, a huge XMEN fan, had high expectations for XMEN days of future past. Not only did this blow out my expectations, it made me feel amazed. The movie has A+ acting, A+ casting, A+ storyline, A+ special effects. The movie made you have a personal connection with each character and feel for the character. There were no forced characters and each person had an important role in the storyline. To fully understand this movie you need to see basically every XMEN movie. spoiler. Bryan Singer says f**k you Brett Radner in this spectacular installment of the XMEN series. After Logan(wolverine) goes back in time and saves the day, he awakes in his present body at Charles Xavier's School for gifted youngsters and is amazed to see that the plan actually worked and everyone is alive. But as he turns around he sees a fully healthy Jean Gray due to the fact that Days Of Future Past makes the events that occurred in the original trilogy irrelevant. After being overwhelmed with emotion Logan goes to kiss Jean Gray, and what do you know....... Scott summers yes Scott summers Cyclops stops him. Both of these characters died in X3 last stand from the godforsaken directing of a**hole Brett Radner. On that note XMEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST is one of my favorite movies of all time and i give it a 10/10."
"Laakbaar","9","2","4","22 May 2014"," Best X-Men movie so far
","This is an excellent movie. (Can you tell that I'm sort of surprised?) The science-fiction story, the writing, the pacing, the acting, the franchise exploitation and the CGI effects all come together really well in this latest X-Men film.<br/><br/>It helps that three of the finest and most versatile actors on the planet are at the heart of the movie.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) has done what is necessary to bring an intense physicality and masculine presence to his demanding superhero role. I liked that he was not at the centre of things all the time, although Wolverine was a key player, as in all X-Men movies.<br/><br/>James McAvoy (the young Charles Xavier) owns his role and conveys the required emotion so movingly. Such a superb actor. What a stroke of genius it was getting him to play the younger version of Patrick Stewart. For me, he was the emotional heart of the film.<br/><br/>The appearance of Michael Fassbender (the young Magneto) on the screen was like a punch to the stomach. Here this versatile actor plays an intense, driven, icy character, and he absolutely nails it. One of the best scenes was one where Magneto confronted the presidential entourage in front of the world's cameras. Mutantus terribilis.<br/><br/>The other actors also rose to the challenge. Jennifer Lawrence, in particular. Wow, Raven/Mystique is one female mutant not to mess with. And then, on top of all that, we also had Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. <br/><br/>This struck me as an intelligent and often moving film, despite the endless fight scenes, superhero powers and city-destruction scenes that you see in every movie nowadays. There were a few nuances and profound messages in this film, for those who were looking for them. And the dialogue never seemed off. There were also a few truly hilarious scenes (I'm thinking now of Quicksilver). The writing is good, very good.<br/><br/>I was worried because I couldn't quite follow the plot at the start. But it soon sorted itself out. I also thought it was a little anachronistic to have such technology in 1973. But hey it's science fiction, and it didn't ruin the movie for me. Loved the 1973 setting, by the way.<br/><br/>Kudos to Bryan Singer, the writers and actors for pulling this off. This is surely the best X-Men movie made so far. It's worth about 8.5. What the heck, I'll give it a 9. Go see it!"

","X-Men: Days of future is an superhero action movie directed by Bryan Singer and had an ensemble cast of Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Halle Berry, Ellen Page, Peter Dinklage, Josh Helman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Nicholas Hoult and Anna Paquin. The movie is seventh instalment of X-Men franchise.<br/><br/>To be honest if you have an option of seeing so much stars in one go and that too with a good plot you shouldn't miss the opportunity.<br/><br/>The best part of the director is despite of having a huge star cast he is successful able to focus on each star and had done justice with their abilities. The plot is predictable but knitted beautifully. The screenplay is crisp and evenly paced so that despite of fast speed of the movie you can understand what's happening. Background music is another strong point of the movie and the visuals effects are mesmerising.<br/><br/>Acting is great, stunts are marvellous. The Only little drawback which few audiences can feel is too much predictable plot.<br/><br/>To conclude the review about the movie, the movie is enjoyable and entertaining.

"williampsamuel","10","0","0","22 April 2020"," The Ultimate X-Men Flick
","Both prequel and sequel to the original X-Men trilogy, Days of Future Past is epic entertainment that incorporates all the best elements of the previous films and brings the mythos of the comics to adrenaline pumping life.<br/><br/>You may wonder how a movie can be a sequel and a prequel at the same time.. The short answer (I doubt there is a simple one) is that in the near future earth has been reduced to a dystopian wasteland in which robotic sentinels have enslaved mankind and hunted mutants to the brink of extinction, and the only way to defeat them is to prevent them from being created. So one man must go back to 1973 to change the past so that all can have a better future. And it's going to be a hell of a lot harder then he could have imagined.<br/><br/>The plot is obviously somewhat more complex than that of the average superhero action flick, and I haven't even begun to get into the really complicated parts with people's past and future selves meeting and the questions about the nature of time itself. This story could easily have ended up convoluted and badly disjointed, and trying to explain it here is rather difficult, but when you see it on screen it all makes perfect sense, or at least as much sense as anything with time travel does. Beyond merely being coherent, the story also brings serious depth and a good degree of unpredictability.<br/><br/>A story is of course only as good as the characters that fill it, and Days of Future Past is filled with excellent characters, brought to life by some of the best actors in Hollywood. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender made tremendous impressions as young Xavier and Magneto in First Class, and if anything they're even better here. Last time McAvoy was highly impressive as Xavier the wealthy and gifted playboy. Now he is absolutely brilliant as Xavier the tortured, substance abusing genius living in the ruins of his dreams. He brings remarkable pathos to the role, and watching him regain his ideals and his purpose is an inspiring experience.<br/><br/>Fassbender likewise distinguishes himself, his intelligence, intensity, and personal magnetism (pun intended) evident in every scene. As Magneto he knows that his actions have and will continue to cause suffering and death for many and that people consider him a monster, yet he is firm in his belief that he is only doing what is absolutely necessary, which lends him a twisted nobility even as it makes him all the more dangerous. Jennifer Lawrence also matches her previous performance as Mystique, with her inner turmoil over her identity and nature as fresh and as relatable as ever. Between Xavier's idealism and Magneto's anger, she is torn between choices which could set herself, and all mankind, down very different and irreversible paths.<br/><br/>While their time on screen is relatively brief, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen nonetheless bring a commanding presence which affects the tone of the entire film. Yet as great as these actors are, the real star of this movie is the guy with the claws. After six times playing the role that made him famous, Hugh Jackman has truly perfected Wolverine. Like he's fond of saying, he is the best at what he does and what he does isn't very pretty. Only this time he can't just claw his way to victory. As the one man with full knowledge of what the future holds, he has to be diplomat and leader, pushing people who are at their very lowest to work together to save the future even as his own past continues to haunt him.<br/><br/>Lest this review give the impression that Days of Future past is all deep themes and character development, this is an action blockbuster, and it is an awesome one. The effects, both practical and CGI, are amazing. The sentinels are gorgeous, in a frightening robotic way, and the filmmaker's have come up with an even more impressive display of Magneto's powers than when he hoisted the submarine in the last movie. The battles are exciting and well choreographed, and find a number of creative uses for the various mutants'' powers. I especially enjoyed the scenes with young Quicksilver, which were clever, visually stunning, and utterly hilarious.<br/><br/>Days of Future Past is the kind of summer movie that delivers in every way. It's smart, deep, well acted, well paced, suspenseful, action packed, and something of an emotional roller coaster to boot. Familiarity with the source material will bring greater appreciation but even those who have never opened a comic book will enjoy it. This movie is so good it literally wipes away the memory of weaker entries in the series. May is not yet out, but I feel safe in saying that the best movie of the summer is here."

","X-Men: Days of Future Past was an interesting movie. I think that the whole Kitty Pryde being able to send people back in time was stretching her powers a little lot. However, I did enjoy seeing many new characters come to life on the live-action screen. Even though characters like Blink, Warpath, and Sunspot all had minor roles, I enjoyed seeing them in action, and think that they should get more prominent roles if they are integrated into the MCU. I think that Mystique should've been more true to the comics and been a true assassin, but that's not the way Fox took it unfortunately. The only reason I rate this movie higher than most of the other X-Men movies is because of the diversity in characters."

","The X-Men series consistently delivers style and substance you don't generally find with fantasy films. I enjoyed the different characters, and the actors - as usual in these films - are very good. Although the film is a sequel to 'First Class', it starts in the future, and then goes back in time to follow on 'First Class', and then simultaneously plays in the past and future, so it can be a bit confusing. But - in typical X-Men style - they handle it so well that everything makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>The visuals are insane! This prequel series is not as action-packed as the original trilogy, but it is captivating and a pleasure to watch.

"jamiedarlow-37510","8","0","0","28 February 2020"," The X-Men sequel we craved so desperately since X-Men 2!
","The Last Stand and First Class were both enjoyable but this one manages to capture the atmosphere of the first two films so well; it's a nostalgic trip while also being something new and fresh. The mutants have reached an apocalyptic state where sentinels reign supreme and are causing the near extinction of mutant-kind. Professor Xavier, Magneto and co. all gather in a remote location in order to change the past and affect their present, attempting to cease the existence of sentinels. With the help of Kitty (Ellen Page), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is sent back in time to reunite the professor and Magneto in their youth and find Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) in order to restore peace and order for their future. It's a top notch action-packed film while also having an emotional core that is genuinely effective; the exploration of Xavier's broken psyche and attempts to find his way again through Cerebro are wonderfully realised and beautifully performed by James McAvoy. The action is pretty flawless and extremely fun; Quicksilver's (Evan Peters) Pentagon jailbreak is visually amazing and very reminiscent of the legendary Nightcrawler White House scene previously in the series. Blink (Bingbing Fan) has really great abilities projecting during the fight scenes, making them some of the most memorable action sequences I've seen in recent years. There's too much to talk about in just one post but the ensemble cast are all brilliant and there's a genuine care and affection for the Marvel source material by returning director Bryan Singer, writer Simon Kinberg and the entire crew. Can't beat the X-Men theme tune too"

","A perfect blend of the original cast from the original trilogy and the new cast from the prequel trilogy, X-Men: Days of Future Past is an epic, time-travel, action filled movie with, once again, solid themes, top notch visuals, great emotional weight and awesome acting.
The cast - both old and new - worked fantastically together and it was such a pleasure watching them all on screen.
Though, Incredibles 2 clearly took several ideas from this, sometimes practically doing rip-offs.
While I'm not going to get into any debates about the timeline and where exactly it all fits in, I will say this: the complaint about the cast not aging is a bit silly. Logan/Wolverine is the perfect proof that the complaint is silly. He doesn't age one bit over the hundred or so years that he's been around due to his powers, so it falls into logic that the characters' powers and such are probably helping keep them look like they've hardly aged. I could be mistaken there, though.
This is a fantastic movie and highly recommended."

","Of all the Marvel franchises, the X-Men films have been the most erratic, alternating between great and mediocre with seemingly every pair of movies released. This trend was bucked when The Wolverine was released last year, and this continues with Days of Future Past, quite possibly the best film in the decade-plus-old series. Rather than any of the actors, the story is the main star of the show. Flashing between two timelines, Wolverine is sent back in time to prevent an apocalyptic war from ever beginning in the first place. It's engrossing stuff, despite the inevitable leaps in logic and ignorance of one of the basic elements of time travel (which I will not get into now). It all culminates in a riveting and spectacular final sequence that tops anything any of the prior films have pulled out of their sleeves.

","In a desperate last stand, The X-men transfer the consciousness of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to the 1970's in an attempt to stop Mystique (Jenifer Lawrence) from murdering Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) and industrialist who is at the forefront of the Sentinel programme, giant adaptive robots capable of identifying and annihilating mutants. The plan requires Wolverine to reunite Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) with Magento (Michael Fassbender) to appeal to Mystique before it's too late.<br/><br/>Visually, ""Days"" is a bit of a step up from ""First Contact"". Some of the effects are striking, particularly around the portal work in some of the present day fight scenes. Other effects, such as the Beast transitions are again improved upon. Plot wise though it's not as tight, driven by a desire to include all the X-men they possibly could (often more than one incarnation of them too) leading to a messy story that occasionally sacrifices some logic for spectacle. Why, for example, they decide they need Magneto with them for the mission is purely to provide Michael Fassbender with more to do. That's not to say it's not a clever story, managing to accommodate so many characters and bridge the gap between the original ""X-Men"" trilogy and this new series is no mean feat, let alone finding a way to explain a bit more of Logan's history and retcon the events of ""X-Men: Last Stand"", the unwanted sequel that all but killed the original run.<br/><br/>The action scenes are particularly strong in this one, both in terms of seeing the X-men fight the sentinels as a team and in one like Quiksilvers ultra slo-mo scene (worth a whole additional star on its own.)<br/><br/>Though perhaps not the most logical, ""Days of Future Past"" is one of the best in the series."

","I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.<br/><br/>It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.<br/><br/>Yet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters - but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot - and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves).<br/><br/>What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations - at least as far as I'm concerned - is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists - what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).<br/><br/>So my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","10","0","0","8 March 2019"," An incredible film that ties both trilogies together.
","One of the more difficult plots to pull off in a film is that of the simultaneous prequel/sequel. Perhaps the most famous of this plotline is The Godfather: Part II (1974). However, I would argue that X-Men: Days of Future Past perfected it. Just like X-Men: First Class (2011) before it, Days of Future Past takes the retro stylings of its decade (this time the 1970's) and places a plot intertwined with the well-known figures and events of the time. It also simultaneously puts the X-Men in a dire and hopeless situation in a distant future, thus driving the need to go into the past to fix the initial conditions that got them into this quandary. Plus, most of the film is driven by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), which just shows how vital he is to the series.<br/><br/>In a return to form that was sorely missing in the previous two films of the series, Bryan Singer directs a film that requires the plots of each of its predecessors to create its narrative. Some will say that the ending negates the need for any of the other films in the saga, but I would almost argue that the other films are needed to show just how much was saved by traveling into the past. This film needed its four predecessors in order to become an awesome wrap-up for the series. It's definitely my favorite of them all, including its sequel, X-Men: Apocalypse (2016).<br/><br/>Not only is the action incredible in this film, but the character development is commendable. The scene-stealing comedy of Quicksilver (Evan Peters) tied with his slow-motion sequence completely cemented this film as the superhero film all others should strive toward. I would have been fine if the series ended at this point, as it accomplished everything the X-Men series needed to, thus giving Bryan Singer the end of the trilogy he truly wanted to create with the original trilogy.<br/><br/>An incredible film that ties both trilogies together, I give X-Men: Days of Future Past 5.0 stars out of 5."

","Combining the classic cast of the first three films, with that of First Class, and adding in new faces, this seventh film chronicling Marvel's mutants is easily the most ambitious. To handle this time-traveling extravaganza, Bryan Singer returned to the director's chair and provides a movie that never gets lost in its own conceit.<br/><br/>Singer's biggest strength is his ability to place comic heroes into our reality, with the film covering real world threats that move beyond the mutant microcosm. The film is also visually stunning with the Nimrod Sentinels battles, as well as the instantly iconic Quicksilver sequence, viewers are treated to some of the strongest action in this franchise. The film also does an outstanding job balancing the cast, and while Wolverine is still central, Magneto, Professor X, and most especially Mystique fully share the spotlight."

","This was probably my 4th time watching this movie. I am a proper comic book geek and DOFP is one of my favourite storylines. They tweaked it some but still gave a really good rendition of it. The cast are great. Jackman leads the way obviously but the other characters get some really good screen time. I have never really liked McKellan as Magneto. He gives a good enough performance but I always thought he was a bit too old and not masculine enough. Fassbender though is a great piece of casting. He exudes power and menace. The scene where he lifts the stadium is quite breathtaking. All the characters are enjoyable in fact, especially quicksilver whose scenes are perfection. I really can't say enough about this movie. It really helped to reboot the franchise and move it in a new direction. A must watch for any superhero action movie fans."

Logic for why to consider Logan as a contender to time travel is worth mentioning too.

","See I loved the movie and is best X men movie till date, if you are going to try and find explanation for so called holes you won't find any.
I had two virtues to look at this<br/><br/>1. The events of 1973 of mystique killing stark leads to this movie. Now you should think that X -men , X- men united and X- men last stand never happened and that is why Xavier and others are shown alive. So if stark was killed this is the next movie after X-men first class and forget all parts ever happened. This way you will love the movie.<br/><br/>2. Now u have to think this way also that this movie never happened ( in future events).
Because the purpose was to stop mystique from killing stark and they succeeds in it.
Now this means that stark wasn't killed And was arrested and sentinel program shut down.
That makes sense in making all the X men movies and in X- men last stand whatever happened is the true happennings, Xavier is no more , Jean and all others<br/><br/>So This movie is just about ifs and buts, had this happened that would have happened and had this thing changed this way those( first 3 parts happened)<br/><br/>Wat I gain from this movie is that stark was never killed by mystique and the events of past in this movie led to first 3 X men movies and that is to be believed. The future events shown never happened because the purpose was served.<br/><br/>
I will say watch this movie without thinking much and just believe the future events shown in this movie never happened cause sentinel program never happened.<br/><br/>So a thumbs up to the first 3 parts .<br/><br/>An altogether perspective is that after first class it was X men and then united and then last stand. So DofP never happened not in past not in future.<br/><br/>Greatest movie"

This movie seemed cramped with emotions, complicated timelines and characters. Actually I'm not a big fan of time travel as a plot device, I think that if you use it you have to really weigh it and do it smartly and here it felt like they had to invent loads of new stuff that was absent from other movies just to make it work. I would have preferred it they just continued exploring the rivalry between young Charles and Erik and didn't invent this huge apocalyptic story."

","'X-men Days Of Future Past (2014)' serves as an apt goodbye to the original cast and a fitting initiation of the new one. This time-travel feature includes some great characters and interesting ideas but an occasional lack of action that does make for a drier watch the second time around, once you know where things are heading. Still, the lulls in excitement never last too long and there isn't usually a lack of character to drive the admittedly somewhat complex plot. The set-pieces that do occur are lavish and well designed, featuring interesting villains and impressively rendered superpowers clashing over two time periods.

Nicholas Hoult was great as Hank McCoy. Peter Dinklage was excellent as Bolivar Trask. Speaking of whom, Trask was an excellent villain for the most of the movie.<br/><br/>The story of this movie was, albeit confusing to the overall timeline, very interesting. The entire third act was flawless. The stakes were very high and that added to the story.

"cdjh-81125","10","0","0","13 January 2017"," An EXceptional Masterpiece
","I have watched every X Men movie ever made, I like almost all of them, they have amazing characters and thought provoking themes, I was beyond excited for this movie it was easily my most anticipated of 2014 and it did not disappoint me at all I was blown away by a superhero masterpiece than is the only superhero movie to come close to the greatness of The Dark Knight Trilogy. For one this film is perfectly balanced, despite all the characters and plot threads present in this film there's never any overlap, wasted characters or clunkiness, I was invested in every part of this film. Hugh Jackman was brilliant in this film not only is he hilarious as usual but he also fits right in with McAvoy and Fassbender characters who once again are fantastic together, we get the sense that these two now have a history that has deeply effected them both. One of my favourite elements of First Class was that we saw Xavier in a different light and this film is no different, we see him now as a broken man who is all out of hope and it was a brilliant way of showing his character. The future isn't in this film a whole lot but it's used in just the right ways, we have all the characters from the future together again which was so satisfying to see and seeing them all taken down together was amazing to watch unfold and helped to showcase the power that these sentinels have. The Sentinels are perfect antagonists for the future time-line they are clearly a menacing presence who make you realise the intense nature of the desolate future. The past time-line mostly centres around Wolverine and his allies trying to stop Mystique from murdering Bolivar Trask played to perfection by Peter Dinklage this story line was done just as well as the future, it was just as intense and the eventual cutting in and out of the time-lines added to the intense nature. The eventual conclusion of the past was done perfectly, it was really heartwarming to see Charles pore his heart out to Raven added to their bond. This last fight was devastating to watch but was ultimately satisfying in its conclusion of having the time-line restored and bettered. <br/><br/>This is one of the only films that has ever made me disappointed after it was finished, because I won't get to watch it for the first time again but I could not be more pleased with the film itself, all the characters have returned and are better than ever, it perfectly blends everything and as a hardcore and committed X Men fan this film was just a tribute to the characters of the comics and the franchise itself. <br/><br/>100%/A+"
"CinematicInceptions","9","0","0","1 September 2016"," Very well crafted story. Brings Xavier's perspective on hope to a new level.
","I'm not going to say that this is everything a superhero movie should be, but it might be reasonable to say that it's everything that an X-Men movie should be. We get pretty good character conflicts, though it might be down one level from that of First Class. We get a couple of great and memorable action sequences. We get a very emotional internal conflict from Xavier, and two decent ones from Mystique and Erik. Most of all, we get one of the best time-travel plots to date. And they all complement each other fluidly to give us an all around great movie. Not a masterpiece, but still praiseworthy.<br/><br/>The time travel featured might not make as much rational sense as the time transcendence in something like Interstellar or the same kind of aesthetic appeal as the time loop in Groundhog Day, but it definitely uses the time-travel device as more than a cop out or an excuse to make more money off of the franchise. By having the main conflict center around changing the events of the past make the stakes higher and more tangible than they would be in the traditional climatic battle between superhero and super villain. I was much more invested in the stakes of this story than I was for Apocalypse, even though Apocalypse was on a grander scale. Plus, Mystique having to make her pivotal decision before tragedy strikes is more true to real life than the traditional climatic decision that heroes typically make. Time travel also changes the dramatic question in the audience's minds as they watch the movie. By virtue of this being a superhero movie, we pretty much know instinctively that the hero will win the day. So Bryan Singer decided to turn the tables a little by making us wonder ""How can Mystique be stopped?"" The battle is now a mental and emotional one. They can't just kill Mystique and be done with it; they have to convince her to have a change of heart. It's best summed up in Hank's musing to Charles ""What if killing Trask is just who Raven is?""<br/><br/>This is a nice segue into the characters. Logan is sort of our protagonist because he gets lots of screen time, but the focus is not on him most of the time. The real protagonist is Charles as he battles the demons within himself and finds the hope that is so vital to who he is. I really identified with his conflict and thought it worked really well with the external conflict of stopping Mystique. Erik/Magneto isn't developed as well here as he was in First Class, but he's still an interesting character. He plays the villain sometimes, but it would be unfair to call him the ""bad guy"" in this case. It would have been nice to have a bit more development for Mystique/Raven, but her motive was exposed very efficiently and it's a very believable motive. Even Trask isn't really that villainous as villains go. Like Magneto's view of humanity, Trask's view of mutants is almost noble and might even be one we could root for if it weren't so distrustful. Hank/Beast comes along for the ride, but doesn't get too much attention.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is very clean. We get treated to some fabulous visual effects, particularly in the Quicksilver action sequence that you can't help but enjoy. Aside from that, the action is above average but not that noteworthy. However, the action sequences are just as intense because of how the different mutant powers cancel each other out in certain situations. For this reason, it's best if you've seen First Class before seeing DOFP. The dialogue is done pretty well with a few outstanding lines. Most of the lines are not written or spoken with too much drama, which is nice because action movies often have that problem. The acting is decent for an action movie, but nothing special.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to any X-Men fan, most action fans, and anyone who likes a good sci-fi plot basis. The story is interesting, but pretty easy to follow. It's a darker movie and deeper than you might expect from a summer action movie. It's also one of the less kid- friendly super movies, but better for it IMO. Even if you're not into action fans, I would still recommend this for the theme of hope surrounding Xavier's conflicts. I know that it was more inspiring to me than it will be to most viewers, but if nothing else, I would urge you to watch the segment in which Charles talks to his future self in Logan's mind. Overall Rating: 8.8/10."

","X-Men: Days of Future Past is probably the biggest, most action-packed superhero film yet, with all the X-Men and mutant villain from the past and future working together to obliterate mankind's threat: the Sentinels. Audiences recognize regular characters such as Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Ian McKellen), Storm (Halle Berry), Shadowcat/Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore). Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Cyclops (James Marsden), and Rogue (Anna Paquin) had brief cameos. Characters from X-Men: First Class were also integrated into this film, including younger characters of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), and Havoc (Lucas Till). One of the most captivating parts of X-Men: Days of Future Past was seeing the newest characters, including Bishop (Omar Sy)--who could absorb energy and reshoot it, Blink (Fan Bingbing)--who could teleport herself and other people with portals, Quicksilver (Evan Peters)--who could run at a superhuman speed, Sunspot (Adam Canto)--who is pyrokinetic, Warpath (Booboo Stewart)--who has superhuman reflexes, and Toad (Evan Jonikeit)--who has superhuman leaping abilities and a long, whip-like tongue. Bishop, Blink, Quicksilver, Sunspot, Warpath, and Toad fascinated watchers were their awesome abilities, displaying a lot of action, struggle, and power. Quicksilver's easiness of the fast life and his making time go slow for him provides comic relief as he fools around with the enemies ubiquitously. The mutants and X-Men of the future live in a desolate, dangerous world where they are always hunted for by the Sentinels, who have become extremely powerful and invincible over time. They make a desperate and extremely risky attempt to change history and prevent the war that dooms both humans and mutants by sending Wolverine back in time to prevent the Sentinel program from starting in the first place. Things don't go exactly well and straightforward, but with the burden of saving the world under Wolverine and the young mutants' backs, they make their best attempts to prove that they are not threats, some mutants going dangerous, violent paths. Fans of X-Men and Marvel comics will adore this movie and enjoy seeing all of their favorite but unseen characters on-screen, like watching Superman and Batman work together, except in a X-Men Marvel comics version. Little hints are sprinkled in that only fans will understand, such as that between Quicksilver and his father. X-Men: Days of Future Past resets everything that happened in the first X-Men movies and leads to the next movie, X-Men: Apocalypse, including an enigmatic post-credits scene."

","OS= Keep in mind that I watched the Rouge Cut Version of this film, and now with that said. Warning: Minor SPOILER ALERT.... 1= The opening VO with Patrick Stewart is very Terminator like, in fact I started think about the terminator movies having similar VO opening. I'm not saying that is bad thing I'm just saying that is what the opening VO reminds me of. 2= The Sentinels designs are much different then what we are used to in the comics and the 90's cartoon, I have not yet decided I like it or not. I think the designs of the Sentinels are much different from the X3 X-men Last Stand training room scene. 3= This almost feels like two different movie, duo to its two different themes and vibes throughout the movie. First you have the Future Terminator vibe, and then you have the old released in the 80's Film Past vibe. 4= The Quick Silver in this film reminds me too much like The Flash in addition I wished that his role was more bigger in this movie. Aside than just 'I did my part, so I'm off (and never to be seen again in this movie)' However I'm a little confused in the first X Men movie he is just a kid, which takes place years after the Past of this movie. But hare is a young adult? 5= This film took place before Shanghai Noon was ever released but in the film one of the characters made a Shanghai Noon reference, huh? 6=One of the best parts of the film was that they retained that Wolverine Humor, at least I found it humorist. 7= The Young Professor X is the very Symbolism of a drug addict, I will not ruin anything for you but the very reason behind his 'Drug Addiction' is somewhat surprising. However I'm not sure how I feel about the cliché ""what am I doing? No I can't (then throws the syringe on the ground) 'moment for professor X. I probably would have had it where Young Professor X maybe almost die and then be forced to give it up in the climax, either that. Or have some kind of dangerous effect of the drug, then have Professor X being forced to give it up willingly just after have a literal mental battle in his head. Professor X V Drug Addict Professor X or something. 8= One of the problems I still have with this Beast is that he still looks like some kind of weird Blue Werewolf Man to me. Like something from the Twilight Movies (not that I have seen any of them, I've only seen the ads.) And I could swear that his skin is different in certain shoots in the movie, more in particularly when he is in the light. In some points in the movie you could clearly see that it is a rubber Halloween Mask. In other points during the movie looks good not perfect but good. 9= There is a nice shift between the Past and the Future and back again, near the end of the movie as they were gearing up for the climax fight or climax fights of the movie. I wouldn't ruin it for you but the way they shoot it was really cool, they have found a way to blend and fused the Past Events and the Future Events. So they would mirror each other. 10= There is a similarity between 'The Cure Drug' and the drug in this movie, which is impossible. Much like with the Quick Silver problem X3 Last Stand takes place years after this movies Past. 11= I can't speak for everyone else but this feels like the darkest XMen Film that I have seen so far, considering I have not seen XMen Apocalypse as of yet. 12= I found it interesting although not surprising that in the Opening VO that Patrick Steward (Old Professor X) Voiced the Opening, and in the closing VO that James McAvoy (Young and Current Professor X) Voiced the Closing. CS= Despite all of the problems I had with it I still think that the X Men Days Of Future Past is well worth the own, because truthfully if you look past the problems it's actually an excellent movie. And it really advances the movie franchise and the story along well. And speaking of I waited an entire year for this version to come out, and I waited for almost a year to watch it. I finally got the chance and it was worth it. CS II= I now it's called the 'Rouge Cut' but I was quite disappointed with the title of the 'Cut' because she was not in it very much. But again still a good movie, just wished they would called it another 'Cut'."

","This is now my absolute favorite of the X-Men movies. It has a great plot and Jennifer Lawrence is at her best as Mystique in this. This film also beats the crap out of X-Men Origins Wolverine. In this movie we see time travel as we see the future of when the Sentinels created by Bolivar Trask have taken over the world and the X-Men are the only ones who can stop them. Also the X-Men of the present have to travel back in time and prevent this future from happening. The X-Men fight through a lot and in the end the world is saved and Mystique is stopped from making the biggest mistake of her life. We also see Wolverine nearly die in this but it sure is a good thing he's OK in the end. We also see the full good in Magneto in this. After all Magneto is not truly evil. He just wants what's best for him in the world. This X-Men film has the best action and excitement and truly deserves a lot of credit. 10 out of 10 for this."

The film combined the cast of First Class with those still alive after the original trilogy. Placing Hugh Jackman's Wolverine in the middle, this time-travel story juggled a tale of the 1970s mutant uprising with a post- apocalyptic story of the remaining mutants hiding from the vicious sentinels. <br/><br/>The continuity went completely out the window, and I remember that confusing me throughout my first viewing of this film. It wasn't until I purchased the movie and rewatched it that I realized that it was a film made to just go with the flow. There is another Rogue Cut still out there that I have yet to see but I hope one day I may get to see the deleted scenes. The original version feels like a film where a little too much was left on the editing room floor.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","X-Men: Days of Future Past is the seventh X-Men film and the sequel to X-Men: First Class. I can say it's hands-down the best X-Men film yet, both expanding the main plot of the franchise and fixing most of the mistakes that some of its predecessors had made. Bryan Singer, who directed the first two X-Men films, returns for this installment, taking over from Matthew Vaughn.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) being sent back to 1973 by Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) to team up with their younger selves (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender respectively), who are still at odds with each other after events of the previous film, and urgently change history from an event that will threaten the very existence of both humanity and mutants.<br/><br/>The action packed moments were very well handled and the dramatic scenes were particularly poignant, especially the parts with Professor X and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). There was also one hilarious scene involving the mutant Quicksilver, which had me in stitches.<br/><br/>I rate it 9/10."

","Homo-Sapiens have created a robotic army capable of taking on the mutant scourge slowly popping up all around the world. The robots are Sentinels, and they have laid waste to the planet as they hunt and exterminate the mutants. The last pocket of resistance is led by Professor X (James McAvoy & Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen & Michael Fassbender), two of the greatest mutants that ever lived. They are being hunted and a last ditch attempt to save the world sees them send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to stop the Sentinels from becoming the force that they are. In the past Wolverine meets the younger versions of mutants he knows in the present future, who he tries to rally to help the cause. While taking the fight to the Sentinels and the humans that built and sanctioned them he has to deal with squabbling mutants, whom, as a species are finding themselves - Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) in particularly is causing a lot of commotion as she comes to terms with the fallout of events from X- Men: First Class. Any extreme action could inadvertently cause a butterfly effect and ruin the future, which is the intention but only with the goal of freeing the world from Sentinels. Confused? Don't be, once you get into the journey of the film it flows pretty nicely. <br/><br/>This X-Men film is loosely based on a comic series of the same name and generally works well, reinventing some events ever so slightly but all in all doing justice to the comics and previous films. This follows on from the success of X-Men: First Class, and it makes up for the first three X-Men films which seem outdated in comparison to this spectacle. The cast of old and new both delivery brilliantly and nerds of the world will rejoice in seeing two versions of some of the characters in the same movie. There is a lot of action from the very beginning through the very end of the film which coupled with some engaging dialogue makes for a good film. There is a lot of CGI and wired stunts but this doesn't detract from the film at all. The fact that an existing timeline is attacked and changed opens up a whole world of possibilities for future films to come. OK, so there were a few plot holes and goofs, but not enough to ruin this film.<br/><br/>This is a lot more sophisticated and classy than the first three X- Men films which hit in the 2000's and stands out not just as a spectacle but practically as piece of art. Great story, great delivery, great film. Even though X-Men: First Class was brilliant, this surpasses it and lifts the bar even higher. I'm going to give this 8 out of 10, and that's only because I rarely give out 9's and I never give out 10's - or I haven't yet but who knows, if Brian Singer can top this I may be able to give out my first 10 out of 10."

","The tendency of today's filmmakers to rely on state-of-the-art technology presents its own paradox: the more the alleged ""filmmaker"" relies on cgi, the less convincing the film s/he produces. X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, like the first two films in the franchise, boasts an interesting enough premise- and the opening sequence is certainly shocking to fans of the serial-, but the rapidity of the action almost manages to undercut its shock value: as with Chapter Two of THE AVENGERS (and I can't help but think of most of today's movies as serials; because they ARE), the cgi hits the fan so fast and furiously that many of the more Dramatic Moments get lost in the backwash. It's only when the movie finally slows down enough to catch its breath that X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTUTRE PAST becomes an absorbing piece of Entertainment, as beautifully realized as Chapters One and Two (Three wasn't bad, but it wasn't as well crafted as this one). Filmmakers would do well to remember that it's the CHARACTERS that make these movies worth seeing for some of us."

","I am a big fan of X-Men series and I am really looking forward to watching every new movie. I have very high expectations towards movies, and there a few sequels that disappointed me - not this one though! ""X-Men"" Days of Future Past"" is by far my favorite movie of all time. What I really like about it is that it has a very complicated plot. It was not the case for previous movies, when the plot was usually quite simple and predictable. In ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"", the plot is really fascinating with all these events going back and forth in time. When I watched it, I was so fascinated that I kind of wanted the particular scenes to go faster. I was so curious what is now going in 1973, and whether the X-Men were able to change the history. It might seem that the movie is hard to follow because the action jumps from the present to the past, but that is not true. The script is quite simple and straight-forward and it makes the movie easy to follow. This movie is a must for every fan of X-Men series, and I am pretty sure that it would satisfy even the most picky viewers. Buy a popcorn, and soda, and get ready for amazing 131 minutes with X-Men who as usually fight against... the mutants."

","The X-Men send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants.<br/><br/>There is plenty to enjoy about this film, but I think it has one shortcoming: without a knowledge of the comic, a viewer might be a little confused. The sheer number of mutants (and other characters) is a tad overwhelming. Of course, some of this is helped if you saw previous X-Men films (as you should), but it is still quite a large amount.<br/><br/>What is very interesting is how Quicksilver appears here, and is also in the ""Avengers"". And these two films do not share the same universe. I am a bit unsure how the rights worked out, but somehow they must have found the character to be acceptable in both worlds. Still odd having him in two movies at once."

","i've seen the 1st one because like everybody, i was a huge fan of the comics, in 2000 it was a pretty amazing movie, the others sequel, well...never mind.<br/><br/>with a rate of 8.1, i can't miss right?, i almost said to myself ''what happen?? they've made a other good one for once'' and wow, it's the best sequel ever made, what a great movie here, the story is really well made, going back to the seventies to stop a war against the mutants, cool, enjoy the ride;<br/><br/>They send Wolverine in the past with a simple mission, team up with Charles and Magneto to stop Mystic who wants to kill Dr Trask (P.Dinklage who is superb ). <br/><br/>The man has invented a device which can reveal if a mutant is around, he also builds a new weapon, the Sentinel to kill them. these sentinels are destroying Mutants, but also all human who is related with or will be.<br/><br/>Well, the biggest treat is, if she kills the Dr. she is imprisoned and her DNA allows of transformed Sentinels, who are at war... 50 years later! reminds me a bit of Terminator Judgment day. <br/><br/>It's way better than a new sequel called ''genesis or 1st class''no?, First class was.. just good and too long! you can see them young as well in this one^^ OK it aimed of settled the newcomers:<br/><br/>J.McAvoy (Charles) is definitely the best cast as a 70's Charles, now a disappointed man who is a junkie (kind of) to get his leg back and free his mind.<br/><br/>M.Fassbender (Magneto/eric)is brilliant as well, a mutant tried to kill J.F Kennedy really? no he was one of ours!<br/><br/>J. Lawrence, alright, she's hype and one of the best actress of her generation (I like her very much, believe me) but, I don't know if it's because I had Rebecca Romijn-Stamos in mind all along the movie, I've found her just good.. enough, even she was great as a Teen Mistic in 1st class.<br/><br/>Just to say, which pleasure to see Omar Sy (Bishop) in a movie like this, who would have believed that his stupid jokes from the time of(Canal +), would lead him towards X-Men, Jurassic World after the magnificent untouchable!<br/><br/>i must say, it was too short, i wanted more, Xmen, with this one, are still on top with avengers and others Marvels hits.<br/><br/>go for it"

","X-Men Days Of Future Past is a Marvel movie based on the X-Men series and came out last year. This time round and Logan(Wolverine)played by Hugh Jackman is been sent back in time to the year 1973 thanks to Kitty played by Ellen Page who uses her powers to bring Wolverine back in time so that he can stop Raven(aka Mystique)played by Silver Lining Playbook star Jennifer Lawerence from killing a doctor played by Peter Dinklage from Game Of Thrones who is set to create these robots(who reminded me of the robots in Avengers Age Of Ultron)that share the same DNA as Mystique. So Wolverine has to find young Charles(this time played by James McAvoy,as the original was Patrick Stewart who also stars in this movie)alongside the beast(Nichloas Hoult)and of course Magento(Micheal Fassebender,as the original was Ian McKellan who makes a cameo appearance too)to come together and stop Mystique from killing the creator of the sentimels. But will they convince her not to destroy the man that created the robots.<br/><br/>Bottom line I was glad to have seen this movie today as I heard a lot of critics hailing it as the best X-Men movie going and since I am a fan of Hugh Jackman(who in my opinion is a very versatile actor of our generation)and having seen all 3 X-Men movies as a kid (the original ones) I can safely say that this was a lot better than Avengers Age Of Ultron.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet my advice is to watch it you won't be sorry. And since this is a Marvel movie stay tuned to the ending credits.<br/><br/>Good: The effects are brilliant and the story is well fast paced and not confusing except for one part where (Spoiler Alert) we get to see all the mutants who were with Logan aka Wolverine before they died in the X- Men Last Stand film back in 2006 and I liked how James Marsden made a quick cameo as Cyclops and Famme Frankin as Jean Grey(Wolverine's love interest). Also Halle Berry is in it too as Storm. I loved Quicksilver who was awesome in this film. Better than Aaron Johnson's portrayal as him in Avengers 2.<br/><br/>Bad: Nothing really to say only I got sorta confused with the scene where like I have mentioned in the good Wolverine sees all the deceased mutants again. Well if I had to pick one than its this where is Stan Lee in this movie? He always makes cameo's so its weird he wasn't in this film.<br/><br/>Overall: This was a very good superhero movie and I give it a thumbs up.<br/><br/>A-<br/><br/>9/10"

I have so many questions that with thanks to my 'geeky' internet friends, have been resolved.Some of my questions; How the hell is Xavier back alive?

"CMTiago","8","0","0","8 May 2015"," More epic and with higher stakes
","After watching X-Men: First Class a few years back and learning of this movie's production, I immediately got excited. FC was a slick and cool movie that showed us the mutants in a spy sort of setting. Overall I was very pleased and it became my favorite X-Men movie. With this one I expected to love it even more but for different reasons. Days Of Future Past always seemed like an epic action packed story that was going to up the ante among X-Men movies. Now after it completing it, I must say I was once again entertained by these characters and their struggles. Still, it didn't claim my number one spot among X-men movies<br/><br/>The plot is centered on a time travel journey, as Wolverine's consciousness will return to 1973, courtesy of Kitty Pryde's powers. There, he must convince a young Charles Xavier to stop an assassination attempt by Mystique that will lead to a world of destruction for both humans and mutants. Hugh Jackman once again delivers as Logan/Wolverine as he offers the action and comedy part of the film perfectly. Featuring mutants such as Iceman, Storm and one particularly fun Quicksilver pop up, it's kind of hard to fully highlight every one of these special beings. The movie however works on the basis of the Mystique, Magneto & Professor X dynamic. Betryal, love and regret are among the emotions explored between these characters and every one of the cast members delivers.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer is the director that was tasked with tying together this franchise within this movie. As far as I'm concerned, I believe he did the best considering the circumstances surrounding this picture. Singer gave us a fun and explosive film, while also presenting the themes so closely associated with the X-Men terrificly. And now let's see what Apocalypse brings us.<br/><br/>Rating: 8,5/10"

","I saw this over the weekend off HBO GO, saving it, having heard great things about it, and ""Days of Future Past"" indeed lives up to the hype!<br/><br/>The ""X-men"" series is not my favorite of the countless super-hero universe film series out there, and I enjoyed the original trilogy, but I thought ""X-men: First Class"" was actually the best up to this point. DOFP may even be better. I just thought it was brilliant how the two worlds of the pre- and post- reboot were brought together. I can't imagine how this would work in most of the other super-hero franchises (even though it was dabbled with a little in ""Star Trek"" with the Mr. Spock character). For instance, you really couldn't have Michael Keaton and Christian Bale play younger and older versions of Bruce Wayne, but Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy blend perfectly together I'd say. <br/><br/>And Michael Fassbender has got to be evolving as one of my favorite actors, having just seen him in a little film called ""Frank"", in which we don't even know it's him necessarily until the end of the film..?? And what a brilliant way to re-introduce the beloved Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) character to the others. I wondered how they were going to do that before going into this. And did I mention the awesome cast??- again, a blend of the pre- and post- reboots- Famke Janssen, Ian McKellen, Ellen Page, Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, and one of my favorite leading men right now- Peter Dinklage.

"SimonpaddyPicks","8","0","0","11 April 2015"," Fun when focused on the original cast
","I was worried as the cast list and director for this film was released, I absolutely adored FIRST CLASS and was saddened to see that Matthew Vaughn wasn't back on board for the sequel (evenif we did get the brilliant KINGSMAN instead). I was worried that the First-class sequel was more and more becoming an excuse for Singer to play with all his old friends, rather than advance the franchise in any way.<br/><br/>Thankfully the film is very much more focused on the story of the 1970's and is much more interesting for it. While the Singer X-Men (for those in the original trilogy) fight a CGI extravaganza in a totally bland cave, the Vaughn-era X-Men move through the sets of a gorgeous 70's spy-fi thriller.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence carries on her brilliant work from the first film and even now with more to do, her Mystique is absolutely one of the most engaging in the film and the wider universe. Having seen the rising prominence of the character in the film series it never seems like she's being given more screen time simply because of Lawrence's rising star status, and the increase in ""things to do"" is a reaction to such a strong actress bringing things out of a character who was more or less a henchman in the original trilogy.<br/><br/>The continued star of the show however is, for me, Michael Fassbender as Magneto. This young Magneto has absolutely become the living example of the X-Men story and the mutant struggle. Always on the edge of what's right, but rarely in the wrong Fassbender completely brings you on board with his position and his anger. The sequence where he confronts Xavier on the plane comes very close to the ""just following orders"" scene from the previous film. Even more so in this film than any that precede it I can see why people would join Magneto's team. Not to mention he looks bloody fantastic in period clothing.<br/><br/>I would have enjoyed seeing a little more of the FIRST CLASS cast back, Lucas Till's brief appearance as Havok aside they're all sadly disposed of off-screen. While these characters were never A-list, and would perhaps have been under served in an already packed out film, I did feel they deserve a slightly more impressive send off.<br/><br/>Another concern(*) prior to seeing the film was how much a lot of the promo material was concentrating on Jackman being back as Wolverine. Whilst I enjoy Jackman in the role, having him out of the plot for FIRST CLASS was refreshing. As it is, he is used well throughout the film – whilst a steady presence he never overwhelms the true story and is even disposed of for the films climax to allow the focus to be Mystique/Magneto/Xavier.<br/><br/>The scenes in the future remain the weakest area of DOFP for me, the Future-era X-Men never feel like anything other than expensive bookends to the First Class story. While some of the spectacle is fine, everything that happens is completely disposable and is even rewritten by the end of the film.<br/><br/>Going forward we know we have at least one more X-Men film in this prequel storyline (APOCALYPSE, scheduled for 2016) and the only thing I don't want this film to be is a ticking off connecting everything back to the first, 2001, X-Men film. The franchise is working well being a series of related trilogies, set me up for a softly rebooted series with the Cyclops/Beast/Angel/Iceman/Jean Grey roster and I'm fully on board.<br/><br/>(*)hey, I'm a comics fan – I do little else but worry about how these films are going to turn out."
"brando647","9","0","0","1 April 2015"," The Triumphant Return of Bryan Singer to the X-Men
","Fox receives a lot of aggression for their treatment of Marvel's comic properties and, while some of it is well founded, people seem to forget that Fox has also done really well with their X-Men series. They've made some serious missteps (X-MEN ORIGINS) but they've also done more good than harm, releasing some seriously awesome X-Men films (e.g. FIRST CLASS, X2). When director Bryan Singer returned to the franchise and announced he was doing a time-travel plot that would bridge the casts from his and Matthew Vaughn's films, I knew we were in for something great. And I was not disappointed. The film opens in the near future where mutantkind has been hunted to near extinction by a force of adaptable murder-machines called Sentinels. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his few remaining X-Men come together with one last ditch effort to end it: Kitty Pride (Ellen Page) will use her powers to send Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) consciousness decades into the past where he will need to connect with a younger, troubled Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and convince them to aid him in preventing a pivotal assassination that set the dystopian future into motion. Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) has gone rogue since losing touch with Xavier and Magneto and she plans to murder Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), a mutant-hating industrialist who's Sentinel program goes on to all but destroy the world's mutant population. DAYS OF FUTURE PAST is easily the most epic X-Men film, uniting the past and present to save the future.<br/><br/>This movie is amazingly fun. I love the X-Men movies (well, maybe not X-MEN ORIGINS) so I was pumped going into the film, and I loved what I saw. As much as I loved Vaughn's FIRST CLASS, I miss the original team and this is the closest we've gotten to a new movie with them since 2006. I would love a new movie focusing solely on them but it was still cool to see Storm, Kitty Pride, Iceman, and Colossus (in a role limited to punching) in action again. Plus, no spoilers, but the end of the movie left me smiling as a fan. We're also introduced to some new faces that I'm hoping get developed more in the future. After a handful of films, we finally meet Bishop (Omar Sy) but he doesn't get a chance to do much; we get to see his powers in action and that was a good start. Blink (Bingbing Fan) is a breakout character in the sense that her power of portal creation made for some fantastic action sequences. The future Sentinels were a little too plain for my tastes. I loved their ability to adapt to the mutant powers and coordinate in slaughtering their targets but their shape-shifting design was too generic, reminding my of the Destroyer from THOR. The future sequences, bleak as they are, are primarily action sequences as the surviving mutants try to defend Kitty and Wolverine but the real juicy stuff is happening in the '70s.<br/><br/>As is the case with most of the X-Men films anymore, Wolverine is a key component to the story but I'm happy to report that he isn't the central character. Just like FIRST CLASS, this is Xavier and Magneto's show with some Mystique thrown in for flavor. Xavier of the '70s is a drug-addled man in a never-ending pit of depression. Beast (Nicholas Hoult) has developed a serum that allows the Professor the use of his legs (following the events at the end of FIRST CLASS) but removes his mutant power of telepathy. When Wolverine finds him in the past, he is a broken man and there's a nice role-reversal as Wolverine must now guide Professor X instead of the other way around. Magneto is still the idealistic criminal, though incarcerated under the Pentagon forwell, that part is best left to the movie to reveal. His escape results in the best sequence in the entire movie when Wolverine and crew recruit a young speedster, Quicksilver (Evan Peters). I was one of the fans worried about Quicksilver's use in the film, knowing that it was quick on the heels of the announcement that Marvel would be using the character in AGE OF ULTRON and fearing this was just a way for Fox to spit in Marvel's face. Plus early character images looked sort of goofy with the costuming. Again, I was wrong and Quicksilver was pure awesome.<br/><br/>I could spend well more than the allotted words praising everything I loved about this movie. I still haven't mentioned Dinklage's awesome performance as Trask or the wicked Vietnam scene. In contrast to my earlier comments on the future Sentinels, the originals from the '70s are much cooler, staying closer to the original comic design. The film has its flaws but they're overshadowed with everything I loved about it. Bryan Singer returned to the franchise he brought to life and essentially apologizes for all the garbage that happened while he was away. For that alone, DAYS OF FUTURE PAST has my fandom but it doesn't hurt that it's just an awesome movie to boot."

","I love science fiction and I hate superheroes, but I credit the X-Men series with giving me an appreciation for them. X-Men has showed me that in the proper context, with some great writers, superheroes movies don't have to be the lowest form of sci-fi entertainment. Days of Future Past seemed to confuse some people, as it's not part of the trilogy and therefore it's timeline is off. The ending of the film also creates a paradox, which eliminates certain mistakes made in the other films. In layman's terms, some of the things that happen in the other X-Men movies, never happen, because of Days of Future Past. In an undetermined era, sometime between the end of the original film and Last Stand, a new enemy has been targeting mutants. These machines, meant to eliminate the mutants have malfunctioned and are now targeting humans as well. The machines are made with mutant DNA and therefore have the combined forces of all the mutants it's come in contact with, making them unstoppable. The only chance the X-Men have is for one of them to go back in time and stop the machines from ever being built. Wolverine is the only one with a mind strong enough to survive the trip and is sent back to the 1970s, where he meets the cast of X-Men: First Class. While difficult for non-sci-fi aficionados to understand, this film was not only extremely well written, but serves dual purposes for the series. First, it brings both casts together in an extreme fashion and it's a tremendous gift for the fans. Second, it allows the writers to undo mistakes from The Last Stand, which was at the time, set to be the final X-Men film. The ending to Days of Future Past, effectively explain that everything that happened in Last Stand, never happened, as it was part of an alternate timeline. This allows the writers to bring back characters like Prof. X (who is seen killed in that film) for possible future films. It really was an ingenious move for the franchises future, but it also allowed fans to experience the ""old timers"" and the ""new class"" working together, in a huge, diverse, and very impressive cast. Seldom are superheroes films so complicated or as well written as Days of Future Past. The writing is out of this world, the cast is full of stars, and the special effects were absolutely amazing. Love it or hate it, superheroes are part of the science fiction genre, but Days of Future Past was simply incredible and for that, it's our latest must see movie!"

","Review: I really enjoyed the first half of this movie, mainly because of Quicksilver and the witty script, but it seemed to slow down in the second half. That's not to say that the film wasn't very entertaining and well written, but it just lacked the punch once Magneto travels down the wrong path. Mystique/Raven doesn't know if she's coming or going throughout the whole movie and Professor X takes some convincing to bring the X-Men back together after suffering depression from losing a lot of his old friends. The plot was very well put together and it was great to see some of the old faces again. Wolverine plays a huge part in the storyline because he has to go to the past to save the future, but we don't really get to see him kick butt like we're used to because his claws are made of wood. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and I can't wait to see what they're going to do with the 3rd instalment of this reboot. I didn't really understand the extra bit right at the end, but I'm sure that it will all come to light. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Why did the X-Men ditch Quicksilver when they were going to look for Mystique? I'm sure they could have used his speedy disappearing skills near the end. Anyway, at first, I wasn't that impressed with Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine but I really can't see him being played by anyone else now. As I'm not familiar with the comics, I don't know how raw Wolverine is supposed to be so I can't really compare him with anything. Apart from that, I loved the relationship between Magneto and Professor X, old and present, and the scene when Quicksilver was taking down the law to save Magneto was absolutely brilliant. The baddie robots looked impressive and Mystique's fighting skills were great but we didn't really get to see what the X-Men are capable of. Maybe that's all to come!<br/><br/>Budget: $200million Worldwide Gross: $746million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are familiar with the X-Men, who have to save the future by going to the past to stop a professor from making robots to kill the mutants. 8/10"

","To be honest, when the first X-Men movie came out the only reason I wanted to watch it was for Bryan Singers direction and Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine. And I was right they didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>But then First Class came to light and it introduced us to brilliant actors like Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy. Finally there was a movie that revealed the reasons behind the complex relationship between them.<br/><br/>Talking about the movie, it starts with a peek into the post-apocalyptic world that is torn apart form the fight against the Sentinals. Bryan's depiction of a futuristic world is both dark and horrific. Over the run time of 2 hours, Bryan manages to grab your attention from the first scene itself. With jaw dropping action sequences and a complex story line, I dare you take your eyes of it.<br/><br/>Unlike its predecessor, this one is dark, gritty and brutal. It also dwells into the complexities of quantum physics and time travel which will make your head spin.<br/><br/>Bryan brings back the old characters giving you a sense of nostalgia. He also introduces you to some new ones, but the fact that they are given very little screen presence leaves you a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>Hugh and Fasbender are back portraying their respective roles with even more conviction and dedication. McAvoy's performance of a man who has lost his path, only to be asked to find a way that will lead to the salvation of mankind, is heart clenching.<br/><br/>A quick mention to Evan Peters, who plays the role of quicksilver to perfection. I am, though, a bit disappointed by the performance of Jennifer Lawerence. Being the integral part of the story, she lacked the conviction required to play the role.<br/><br/>To conclude, I had a hell of a joy ride. With a cast to die for and action scenes leaving everybody breathless, you will definitely leave the theater wanting to grab the tickets for the next show. So go grab your movie buddies and enjoy this summer blockbuster."
"joetufano882","9","0","0","2 January 2015"," My favorite X-Men movie to date.
","I got into the X-Men franchise within the past year after seeing the teaser for this film. I really like the first two films by Bryan Singer, First Class is really good and I actually like Wolverine (2013). I didn't bother with Origins, and yes X3 was a piece of crap. But luckily, this movie makes up for that in so many ways. I still have yet to read an X-Men comic or watch an episode of any of the animated series, but I'd consider myself a fan of X-Men after watching these movies. <br/><br/>The story as far as time travel is very reminiscent of Terminator with the sentinels search for humans and mutants in the future which fits in with the tone of the original trilogy and with the bright color palette in the past that ties into First Class and it also reminded me of Back to the Future with the fish out of water humor for Wolverine and of course with the ending where Logan wakes up to find that the future has changed for the better with Cyclops and Jean being alive. It might be too hard for some people to follow because of the multiple character, but each one gets their moment to shine. All thanks to Simon Kinberg's screenplay, the story doesn't feel packed as it seems at first glance. Singer also shows that he's more comfortable in his direction, out of respect to his previous movies, the scope of this film feels bigger and energetic than X 1 and 2. Even more than First Class I'd say. The drama and comedy have a nice blend together, the pacing is relentless but it doesn't forget to focus on the important things much like Dark Knight. And John Ottman's score is amazing, especially the opening theme. <br/><br/>As I said, the characters each get their moment to shine and the actors deliver 100%. Hugh Jackman as Logan is great once again, and it's cool to see him as a more experienced Wolverine and is the one trying to help a younger Charles Xavier who at this point in his life has lost his way. And James MacAvoy gives probably the best performance out of the entire cast as we see Xavier learn how to hope again. Michael Fassbender is even more terrifying as Magneto than he was in First Class, and Jennifer Lawrence (my favorite actress) kicks ass as Mistyque. Nicolas Hoult, Patrick Stewart, Mckellan, Ashmore, Dinklage, Ellen Page, etc. are really good in their roles. And yes, Quicksilver is awesome. That scene in the Pentagon is priceless! <br/><br/>I also like the central theme of hope particularly the hope Charles has for Magneto and Raven despite them getting their hands dirty. In a way I feel that this plays into how the franchise is now back in full form since X3 and Origins brought the quality down through the floor and with First Class turning it back in the right direction. It's easy to get pessimistic about the future when things don't go your way, but it goes to show in this film that things can and will get better in time. Hope sometimes really pays off, and the film's ending is the prime example. <br/><br/>As far as the flaws, they don't really matter to me but I would've like one explanation as to why Mistyque wasn't in the future and how Kitty Pride had the time travel powers. But at the end of the day, they don't really matter. <br/><br/>This movie has officially made my top comic book films of all time with TDK trilogy, Spider- Man 2 (2004), Winter Soldier and Avengers and I'll go as far as to call this movie my favorite of 2014. Thank you Bryan Singer, Simon Kinberg and the rest of the team for making this movie, and I look forward to seeing Apocalypse!"

","Days of Future Past Review X-men days of future past marks the 7th x-men film to come to cinemas and is quite possibly the best since x-men 2 in 2003. Director Bryan Singer who directed the first two x- men films picks up the franchise after the massive thematic and chronology changes left by the other films and their directors. Some of the mammoth tasks facing singer with this film included accounting for the deaths of several major characters in x-men last stand and continuity questions raised by x-men first class. Having checked some of the media reviews by some newspapers I found their reviews rather critical and not understanding the nature of the source material and the excellent job of adapting that story from page to the big screen. The more niche outlets and reviewers heaped on the praise a lot more, perhaps they are more invested in the universe in the characters. Confused. I would strong advise watching at least xmen first class before this and I'd recommend the original trilogy as well. Minor Spoilers<br/><br/>The premise for the film comes from the 80's fan favourite comic of the same name, it is one of the many x-men time travel stories and involves a young kitty pryde/ shadowcat going back in time to stop the sentinel programme which later leads to machines wiping out mutants. It was decided to make Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) the timetraveller, this was a smart move as the audience is accustomed to the character, it is easy to suspend disbelief as wolverine is equally perplexed by what is happening around him, in much the same way the audience is. One of the difficulties in balancing this film was giving enough time to the old and new cast, the focus is certainly focused more towards the new cast. The character mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is tied directly to the plot as it is her wolverine is sent back to stop, this was a wise move as it develops the mystique , Magneto(Micheal Fassbender) and Charles Xavier/ Professor X's (James McAvoy) triangle nicely, this proved to be one of the strongest parts of the story. These 3 actors have proved their acting abilities all coming off a string of strong performances in shame,twelve years a slave, trance, filth, silver lining playbook and the hungergames which have made all of them a-listers, all 3 of the actors play off each other excellently and their scenes together are a joy to watch. Besides the acting heavyweights IanMckellen as the older magneto and Patrick Stewart as the old Professor X the remainder of the cast are not given a lot to do except as being special effects set pieces, whilst the cameos are appreciated this will likely annoy some of the comic fans who are begging for other x-men characters to be fleshed out besides wolverine. The only two new characters are Bolvier Trask(Peter Dinklage) and Quicksilver played by , dinklage is underused and is given very little chance to act, he seems miscast and out if place, perhaps a role as a more maniacal villain or as a mutant would have been better, the quicksilver introduction was not overdone and paid off well. Besides a few references to Vietnam and Nixon and the clothing the setting was largely underutilized which is a shame, a hippified Xavier may have been interesting. The Xmen series has always been symptomatic of the themes of fear and violence, staples of the persecuted minority status, the moral debate is raised when the prospect of extinction is present it raises the stakes further pushing the extents the characters are expected to go. Minor Spoilers End<br/><br/>The special effects were brilliant throughout, the future sentinels are really menacing and pose a strong threat to the strong remaining mutants, the older sentinels match the artistic style originally developed for the comics and are possibly slightly underused. The makeup and prosthetics for beast and mystique were again extremely well done as was the cinematography. Moving on the x-men franchise is in a good place from a chronological and storytelling perspectives, having shown the scope of a big x-men movie that can match the likes of the marvels avengers. In a lot of ways it is fortunate marvel don't have the cinematic rights to the x-men as their universe alone is comparable to that of the other marvel characters, this movie shows that that universe is big enough to be left alone to thrive on it's own merits. After Singers failures with superman returns and jack the giant slayer it is good to see him back where he belongs, and that is directing x-men movies."

","I discovered the X-Men's there some years ago. I really took a lot of fun watching them. Loved identify with the character of Hugh Jackman, Wolvorine / (Logan). It seemed perfectly normal to be attracted to this version out on the big screen. At the first opportunity we have to see the movie in theaters. With new technology, the special effects we are impressed. And the image of the first movies we have not been disappointed. This is a film completely amazing science fiction. It would have been a shame not to see him on the big screen. But still I advise you to watch the entire series, doing a marathon day, one behind the other, good plan for the long winter day"

","As I sat down and wait for the movie to show, I recall all the X-Men movie released in the past and put my expectation to be a little more higher. As the movie started, I can't imagine how they show great value to good details and script. The details shows great value of work and definitely a high level of movie expertise. <br/><br/>The movie started in the future in which tragedy struck both humans and mutants alike. That tragedy has taught them the value of decisions we're making in the past on how it will affect our future. One small mistake, can lead to a huge amount of downfall of man. As Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) cast aside an effort to reunite two of his future companion, Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), it came across to a section of the movie wherein I was struck the most. It is where Peter/Quicksilver (Evan Peters) hilariously struck the role with good showmanship and of course a good attitude. <br/><br/>I can favor more of Marvel Movies released this year but as for the move, X-Men:Days of Future Past, I can say that it was a spectacular released and will grant the viewers the enjoyment and the curiosity on what will happen on the next movie.<br/><br/>8/10"
"fernie121793","10","0","0","9 December 2014"," Good But Not Great Why ?
","So this movie was okay I've seen many times and still enjoyed watching it but my only complaints are was that there wasn't so much scenes from the future I felt that the movie focus way too much in the past and as always not enough character development which has always been a problem for the movies the only characters that fully developed were Xavier and Mystique played by James McAvoy and Jennifer Lawrence respectively which they both did an amazing job and a step up I might say even though I assume J-Law winning that Oscar was given more time to play the shapeshifting Raven and James really gave all his effort for playing miserable Charles and took the lead as leading man unlike Michael Fassbender who stole the show in First Class. Rogue was cut off which left me disappointed but we'll be ready for the alternate cut of the movie on DVD soon. Quicksilver was a highlight. Bolivar Trask by Peter Dinklage was a missed for me because he wasn't much of a villain like his comic book counterpart not his fault but felt he was mishandled by the script he was given or was poorly miscast but the sentinels were the main villains of the movie although I believe ignorance itself was the main villain in the movie. It bothered me so much that Patrick Stewart and Ian mckellan, Halle berry great actors who all had little roles because of personal issues and or other commitments in other projects I would like to see more of Erik and his magnetic charm and powerful Storm herself have much larger screen time but nope. All the other characters were great but hardly some of them had lines mostly they just look cool and engaged in battle and that's all. But this movie was okay not a masterpiece nor a classic but a good chapter in the x men movie franchise."

","This film was by far my favourite out of all the Xmen films. It has all the same special Sci fi effects as the previous films do, and a similar compelling storyline that is so intense it has its viewers on the edge of their seats. The thing that I found so awesome about this particular film, is the essential step back through time, the only chance the mutants have to save their kind and defeat the sentinels from wiping them out completely. We see some of the mutants when they are younger. They are stubborn and reckless, and ever so beautiful, like helllloooooo Magneto! Who would've though old Gandalf (Yes, I also see him as Gandalf in Xmen) was such a stud in his younger years! Even Professor X, was quite the handsome fellow. We see how their personalities have changed over time and we feel the struggles they went through in their younger years in contrast to where they are in the future. Everything gets pieced together for us. The ending is a bit of a tear jerker - that is if you've seen and loved all the films, although slightly sad because we don't get the perfect happy ending for wolverine that we're all hoping for. Overall, absolutely awesome film, I'll be watching it again very soon!"

","This is a good action movie with pretty good special effects.A very good job done by the ""Returned to the Franchise"" director Bryan Singer. Since the movie has a large cast,the movie unqualified the viewers to know some characters and their origins, which could be done in the up-coming movies.<br/><br/>Coming to the movie, at first story was ordinarily understandable, then in the middle, because of the fast running of the plot left the viewers a bit confusing, but this cloud fades away in the end. The end also left some untied spaces, which is good for the franchise to leave some suspense to the fans. Trailer gave-up most of the plot, which makes fans miss the old ambiance in the movie theaters. Finally, to the makers, a little suspense and twists could be good in the movie, without giving away the major plot in the trailers."

","X men first class was a great way to restart the franchise. . My hopes drop down a little bit when i heard Matthews Vaughan left the movie. So I went to watch it with low expectation. Well you all know the story so no point talking about it. To just brief you a little bit about the story. The future is being rule by sentinel, who both have a control of mutant and human. Mutants face an extinction, so the x-men team in the future sends Wolverine back to change the past by stopping a certain assassination from happening. The movie handles the time travelling part well, time travels can be a complex thing to explain to the viewers. But here you can understand it but yet you'll still have a lot of questions in the end because when they change the past then the future in x men 1 2 & 3 changes. There are a bit of unanswered questions in this film which is frustrating and I don't know why filmmakers always choose to ignore them, a five minutes explanation would be better than a scene which include some lame jokes. But apart from a slightly questionable story, the movie was enjoyable. Once again the highlight of the movie is the interaction between the young Erik and Charles. Fassbender and McAviy, both seem so smoothly into their character. Michael Fassbender is fantastic in magneto. His sole purpose of keeping mutants alive and protecting them from the society through extreme measure is so understandable that you have every reason to support him. While James McAvoy as Charles other hand is a revolution. It amazing how much of wisdom along with emotions he manages to show on screen and those moments give you a good idea what the future Xavier is. This movie and the previous one contain all the landmark and understanding of what both Magneto and Xavier grow up to be. You cant hate either of them,because you'll just end up loving both of them. It hard to choose between them. And there interaction between them is fantastic. You can feel the sadness, love, hate and respect they have for each other. And the way these two actor express their emotion together is nothing short but spectacular. But again while this is the best part of the movie, it sadly the bad thing about cause those scene between Erik and Charles are just too short. In First class, they both were together from the start to the end. And had loads of moment where the difference can be seen. Here it's just short. That's why i feel they were wrong to bring up a story like this which involves the previous class. They could have just pick off when first class left. And show how Erik continues his journey to become and Magneto and Charles to Xavier. The interaction between the old Xavier and Magneto and Old Xavier with Charles is another touching moment of superb directing, acting and writing. Mystic sadly is not effective as she was in first class. I loved her in first class especially her relationship with beast, Charles and Erik. But here she seems lost. I blame the writers for her character. They make her on her own. Apart from the story, their are plenty of action scenes, they are good at times and okay at times,nothing ground breaking. The camera work is nicely done here. Music is good and bad at times. I miss the first class music to be honest. Especially the magneto theme they had. All in all it was an enjoyable movie, a bit too strong for children. They might have trouble understanding it."

","With X-Men – Days of Future Past, director Bryan Singer makes a welcome return to the mutant universe. He had helmed the first two films but jumped ship on the third one, directing the morose Superman Returns instead. Brett Ratner took the helm for X-Men: Last Stand and almost sank the franchise with a rambling mess of a movie, which badly flubbed the classic Dark Phoenix storyline from the comics. Trying to salvage the franchise, the next movie (X-Men: First Class) jumped back in time to tell an origin story, with not too much regard for continuity with the trilogy it followed. X-Men – DoFP forms a bridge between First Class and the trilogy by way of time travel, and is based on another iconic story from the comics. In the movie version, Wolverine's consciousness is sent back into the past, into his younger body, to prevent an assassination that will lead to an all-out, devastating war between humans and mutants. To effect this, he will have to convince Xavier and Magneto to make nice with each other.<br/><br/>X-Men – DoFP again plays fast and loose with continuity, ignoring most of what happened in The Last Stand, but oddly not all. If you saw the scene from the end credits of The Wolverine, or simply saw the trailers for X-Men – DoFP, you may have been wondering how how Magneto got his powers back and how Xavier is alive. Well, keep wondering, as the movie does not explain either of these things. Admittedly, The Last Stand hinted at both developments with its final shot and the end credits sequence respectively, but it feels like a pertinent part of the story was skipped. Not that I can see how it could have been squeezed into this outing, apart from just blurting out one or two lines of exposition. X-Men – DoFP is already longish and focused on other things. In any case, most people – myself included – will be happy that X-Men – DoFP clearly gives its blessing to people pretending that The Last Stand never happened, or was an alternate universe, or whatever. Messing around with time travel, has now given future X-Men films leeway to pick and choose with regards to continuity. Just show Wolverine raising an eyebrow and have him go 'Hey, that's not how it happened!' and you're in the clear.<br/><br/>But aside from all that – is X-Men – DoFP any good? Yup, quite. I know it plays fast and loose with its comic book source material, but the cast is engaging, the action sequences are spectacular and the plot is a fine piece of hokum. There is a good balance between character moments and action, though the movie stuffs in a bunch of mutants who get cool fights, but are given no personality to speak of. If you've read the comics, you can project depth onto them, but they will be intriguing but flat if haven't done your nerdy research. Most of the focus is on the cast from First Class, but there are some surprising cameos from the 'original' cast.<br/><br/>The most interesting 'new' character is Quicksilver (Evan Peters) a kleptomaniac speedster. Those in the know, know he is – in fact – Magneto's son, but though the movie drops a cheeky line of dialogue hinting at this, that's all you'll hear about it. People were all ready to hate this incarnation of the character when pictures surfaced with him in an awful, silvery costume. And it is indeed a horrible costume, but one that is only on-screen for a very short amount of time. There is a scene in which Quicksilver takes out a room full of guards – seen from his superfast perspective – that will make you want to cheer, and Peters makes him charming and cocky. It's a shame he doesn't hang around for longer. The next Avengers movie (Age of Ultron, due 2015) will also feature a version of this character, as Quicksilver – confusingly – is both part of the mutant universe (movie rights held by Fox) and the Avengers universe (movie rights held by Marvel, but any mention of mutants is iffy). Another blow to continuity, but *shrug*.<br/><br/>Despite having a good time with the movie, I was scratching my head at the grand finale. Though changes were made to the original timeline, it seems that what happened instead wouldn't exactly have made things better for mutants in the long run. Except that it apparently did. And who am I to argue with the vagueries of cause and effect? As long as I can purge The Last Stand from my mind completely, it's all good. @PopCultJunk"

While the transports were interesting and different, the monsters, for lack of a better word, were a combination of monsters from Terminator, Thor, and other movies. You would think someone on the creative team could come up with something mildly original. Perhaps a monster based on a centipede...<br/><br/>6. Music--I barely noticed it, and that's a good thing. <br/><br/>Bonus: There are two scenes that tapped so deeply into my teenage nerd mind, as if Dr. X had contacted that part of my brain, that I was blown away.

That Jennifer Lawrence can act, and hopefully she will get better, more challenging roles as her fame increases. <br/><br/>Rating: Matinée.

","""X-Men: Days Of Future Past"" (12A) Director: Bryan Singer. Starring: Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and Peter Dinklage.<br/><br/>Since Bryan Singer departed from ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" in 2006 (to direct ""Superman Returns"", we could have done without it, right?) and foolishly left it within the incapable hands of Brett Ratner, the franchise never felt that it reached the same heights as ""X-2"", despite Mathew Vaughn's well received continuation of the series, ""X-Men: First Class"". However Bryan Singer has finally returned to the directing chair to deliver drama, action and interesting Sci-Fi, in his classic style. <br/><br/>Set in the year 2023, ""X-Men: DOFP"" finds our world in absolute apocalyptic turmoil, as the mutant-slaying, robotic hunters known as the Sentinels, scour planet Earth in order to rid the world of all Mutant- kind. Now with only a small pocket of Mutants left (including Wolverine, Magneto and Storm) acting as the resistance, they realise that the Sentinels are an unstoppable force.<br/><br/>As Patrick Stewart's Professor X so rightly states, ""Is the future truly set?"" It seems not, as Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page, where's she been these past few years?) argues that due to Logan's ability to heal at lightning fast speed, his consciousness should be sent back into the past to seek the help of the team's former selves, in order to change the events of history forever. Despite its slightly confusing plot-line ""X-Men: DOFP"" deals well with the interweaving stories, and presents itself as perhaps this summer's most inventive blockbuster.<br/><br/>In regards to being inventive, Singer once again directs with a perfect balance, as he directs his ninth film with expert camera-work and beautiful cinematography from Newton Thomas Sigel (""Drive"") to match. <br/><br/>The cast itself are (as always) uniformly brilliant, along with Jackman, McAvoy, Dinklage and Fassbender delivering great performances amongst the large and ambitious set-pieces; it's Jennifer Lawrence though, who ultimately receives the largest amount of screen-time and character development as Mystique, and rightly decides to once again prove her undeniable talent for acting. Despite this ensemble cast however, it unfortunately seems that there are far too many characters to actually keep a track of, and are (like the characters of ""Godzilla"") ultimately missed.<br/><br/>In spite of its misused cast, we are (briefly) introduced to the character of Quicksilver (AKA Pietro Maximoff, played brilliantly by Evan Peters), a young man who has the amazing ability of superhuman speed, who sets about saving the team from many a misfortune, including an exciting scene in which Maximoff sprints around a villain-filled room so fast, that whilst running, he rearranges the directions of each security guard's guns, hats and fists, leading to a humorous climax. <br/><br/>There is also a welcome return from Singer's regular film composer John Ottman, who produces an often dramatic and exciting score, which is reminiscent of Alan Silvestri's soundtrack of ""The Avengers"" (2012). <br/><br/>The overbearing cast was an unfortunate step to have made, but Singer and his screenwriter Simon Kinberg eventually make up for their minor mistake, in the form of some much needed, yet reserved character development, which is what the first two ""X-Men"" instalments prided themselves upon; being a Superhero film that was intelligent and dramatic, yet action-packed. <br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>""X-Men: DOFP"" is an impressive return from Singer and despite the misuse of this high-calibre cast, it works almost as well as ""X-2"". It's most definitely not perfect, but it is an excellent beginning to the large group of summer blockbusters.<br/><br/>7 Stars out of 10<br/><br/><ul><li>Written by Scott Gentry.</li></ul>"

It is good fun at times also with characters such as Wolverine delivering those line we want to see to make us not feel this film is completely serious throughout. You may have to be a fan of drama at times to enjoy this as bits could seem stale, but I think that is just the dramatic side of the director and writers etc.<br/><br/>The main cast are good in this one and with the return of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen along with others, this is hugely an enjoyable and fun cast. I felt Hugh Jackman didn't have the best of his Wolverine portrayals here, although he does the job well, I think in the end that Michael Fassbender steals the show out from everyone, his dark demeanour coupled then with his straight face where it hard to predict if he is angry or not makes him in my opinion, the star of the show.<br/><br/>The ensemble of writers do well here and the script in my opinion is stronger than in the first, it has good word choices and you can see they have revised the script to really bring out the dramatic moments more. Bryan Singer does well here and even amongst the massive effects which are showcased all the way through, his touch actually makes them better as you can see the way he moves the actors and really brings in an air of believability. On to the effects, they are good, better than the first again but not SO much better, one part with a certain baseball stadium is just fantastic, truly showing the evolution of effects since X-Men started. <br/><br/>It isn't without criticisms, it feels quite long even though it is 131 minutes, you can at times feel like you are watching a 3 hour film, mostly down to the bits where talking is dominant. I think another problem is possibly that at times effects can seem overused, not too much at all but you can feel like ""why did they have to do that then"", not annoying just maybe ascetically, it doesn't look as nice as it would using real motion or costumes. I didn't care much for a lot of the supporting cast, they didn't seem to put effort into this, although the main cast are in enough to block them out.<br/><br/>If you like superhero movies, then this could be for you although maybe if you want big action as such, then maybe not, this has it but can have long spells of only dialogue. For anyone who isn't so much a fan of comic book movies or X-Men, then this is actually a good advertisement for the franchise, I think if you see this then some people could really want to see all the films as it can really engage you at times and even bring back memories of the original films and what happened in them.<br/><br/>Overall it Just About Very Good, only just though, it has bits that lag a little but manages to carve out a very good ending which in the end is why the film turns out very good. If you rarely watch superhero movies then this is actually one to watch if you feel you should watch more of them, it isn't the best Marvel has to offer but it is up there and really fights to be a better film, much more of this film series is wanted please."
"chaz_merida","8","0","0","3 June 2014"," Why X-Men missed its potential Avengers moment
","X-Men: Days of Future Past Review SPOILER ALERT The X-Men franchise has always produced good movies, and X-Men: Days of Future Past is now included. The film was simply a great movie and I am granting it a full B rating. This was not ""The Avengers"" by any means which receives an A++.<br/><br/>Definitely a buy-able movie of course, and with the Quicksilver scene at the Pentagon, it is a movie that will easily hit the 100 views on my BluRay player.<br/><br/>Quicksilver turns out to be the breakout superhero in this movie but for some strange reason, they decided not to have the character with the X-Men after Magneto was freed. This does not make any sense whatsoever. Quicksilver would have been pivotal in every scene after Magneto's freedom, to include eliminating some scenes that were just too stupid and NOT Comic Book accurate.<br/><br/>Sure Magneto is a bastard, but he's not an idiot. He knew how sensitive the situation was with Mystique and stopping her, but no he needs to be a complete idiot. Idiot Magneto not only screws up the plot but engages the X-Men on a ""Whose Got the Bigger Penis"" game. Professor X being a whinny little bearded retard did not do well for the movie either.<br/><br/>The only characters of the movie that didn't screw anything up were Wolverine and the humans. Wolverine can't do bad since its Hugh Jackman that controls him despite whatever the director says. I can't say that for the other characters and actors.<br/><br/>The Beast with his on/off powers was such an Anti-subject plot that anyone who read the comics should have been repulsed at that. It was almost like the Beast had the same control problem as the Hulk. You can't engage another characters storyline simply by saying ""oh yeah, I take a shot and only change into the Beast when I get angry or when I say Simon Says"". That was a Bullshit maneuver on the movie decision makers. They should have kept Beast as Beast! End of Story! Mystique was again awesome! Jennifer Lawrence is beautiful and amazing. Jennifer is definitely the better of the two ladies that have played the character. I hope she continues her Mysterious role as this amazing mutant anti hero.<br/><br/>Although the character of Trask was not short in the book, Peter Dinklage does not shorten the role at all. He is strong and solid in every scene, including the scene during his office visit, aka Mystique moment.<br/><br/>The Sentinels were scarier in this movie than they ever were in the book. The context of the end of mutant kind was a sincere tone throughout the movie, yet the mutants that were so amazing introduced without names – died without names. To introduce characters to kill them is OK but at least allow the audience to connect with them in some way like giving them names a short back story, something to justify their demise. But no, they did not. I give this movie a solid B and look forward to the next installment to the X-Men franchise."
"mistercsays1","7","0","0","1 June 2014"," Mutants Under Fire
","The X-Men series has been one of the most consistently impressive of all the cinematic comic book franchises of recent times. Whilst there have been a few missteps along the way, these films have generally proved to be sophisticated and thought provoking as well as thoroughly entertaining without the over-the-top bombast to which so many other films of this type fall victim. By and large, X-Men: Days of Future Past fits the bill in this regard, with story and characters holding their own against the tsunami of special effects and action sequences that we expect in a science-fiction film of this type. A star-studded cast helps considerably and the return of Bryan Singer to the director's chair lends the film a sure hand that puts it on par with the best in the series thus far. Obviously, there is a silliness to it all, but Singer wrings plenty of tension from the series of events and ultimately delivers a film that allows you to overlook the preposterousness of the premise to actually give a damn about the characters.<br/><br/>This seventh film in the series offers the best of both worlds in that the established X-Men regulars link up with their younger selves from X-Men First Class to change the course of history and save the mutant population from extinction. As such, X-Men: Days of Future Past begins with the X-Men under attack from robots known as Sentinals, developed by millionaire scientist Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) to eliminate all mutants. In the face of obliteration, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) bury the hatchet and join forces to hatch a survival plan. With an ability to transport a consciousness back in time, Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) is called upon to return Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to 1973 with a mission to thwart Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) in her bid to assassinate Trask. Along the way we meet several new mutants, easily the most interesting and amusing of which is Quicksilver (Evan Peters), whose lightning speed proves vital in helping Wolverine and the young Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) break the young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) out of his underground cell beneath The Pentagon in a sequence that is a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Through the course of the film we discover that mutants served in the US military during the Vietnam War and that President Kennedy was himself a mutant, killed despite the best efforts of Magneto to divert the bullet. Yes, it is a silly premise, but we are willing to accept it because the film never takes itself too seriously and is certainly devoid of the earnestness that tends to pervade contemporary superhero narratives. Perhaps it is the fact that these characters are not heroes per se that allows the filmmakers to make them much more morally ambiguous and thereby more interesting. Whilst the film contains plentiful political and historical references aimed squarely at older audiences, there is no doubt that the current cultural cache enjoyed by the likes of Lawrence and Dinklage will also lure in younger viewers who might not ordinarily be drawn to such films. Nicholas Hoult features prominently as the 1973 version of Beast while, in the present, Storm (Halle Berry) and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) team up with Blink (Bingbing Fan), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Warpath (Booboo Stewart) and Sunspot (Adan Canto) in trying to keep the Sentinels at bay. The beguiling Famke Janssen makes a late appearance as Jean Gray and there are blink-and-you-miss-them moments from the likes of Kelsey Grammar, James Marsden and Anna Paquin.<br/><br/>It is Wolverine, the only character to appear in each film played by the same actor, who again proves the central figure in driving the narrative. He is charged with alerting the younger incarnations of Magneto and Professor Xavier to what the future holds if they do not work together and, as such, Jackman is the only performer who appears in the past and present sequences of the film. However, McAvoy and Fassbender are equally effective in their portrayals of their somewhat complicated characters, which bodes well for the future of the X-Men series. The return of Singer (who helmed the first two films in the series) has resulted in a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking, exploring the two things that, perhaps more than anything else, motivate people to act badly towards others; ignorance and greed."

","In my humble opinion this one was a lot better than future past. I thought the characters were awesome and I'm glad they brought back some old faces as well. Not all the old faces but faces none the less. There is this one funny scene in the movie that you should have read about. Of course I'm not going to tell you myself you should go see the movie. The title speaks for itself when it says days of future past. It basically goes back in time and tell what lead to the action in the beginning of the movie which was awesome so many >>> not going to say.The main reason I like it because it combined the old cast with the new ones. What I mean by the old one from x-men 1 to 3. I found that 1-3 were the better ones they made sense. The plot was awesome and it focused around a character that should have not been focused but yeah, Go see it is just as good as captain America: the winter soldier. Not better but just as good!"
"yvonneshusband","8","0","0","1 June 2014"," The X-men movie timeline has been altered by the events in this movie...how?
","I really enjoyed this movie, but even though I'm not a huge x-men fan (I haven't even seen all the movies), it's obvious that the timeline of the movies has been changed by what takes place in this one! If you consider Mystique's capture after she originally kills Trask, following which she is experimented on to perfect the sentinel robots, this quite obviously means that she is no longer alive at the time of the original X-men films (assuming her brain is dissected, as is certainly implied when Trask discusses her biology later in the film). Magneto being imprisoned in 1963 also implies that his history will differ from that already seen to date. Wolverine's rescue by Mystique at the end of the movie implies he won't be acquiring his steel claws as originally shown either. And to cap it all off...Professor X is alive in 2023! Forgive me for the number of spoilers, but they lead up to my point...how come the writers and directors have introduced time travel into the X-men movies only to create an alternate timeline to the previous films, unless they've done it deliberately?"
"hugorocksmy","8","0","0","29 May 2014"," One of the Best X-Men Movies, But Overwhelming...
","X-Men: Days of Future Past is probably is the perfect movie for all the fans of the comics and the movies, but if you don't know much you'll either be lost sometimes or just start fresh with this movie -and I am one of the those who got lost, even though I have some previous knowledge from the franchise- because a lot happens, and changes everything from some of the previous X-Men movies. Therefore, my only problem with the movie was that everything happened so fast, that it almost felt as if nothing had happened. And that to me felt like a problem, because after the movie ended I still was trying to figure out what had happened and how it all affected and changed the timeline from the previous X-Men Movies. Also, I was trying to put the pieces together, but after I did some research and reading, it appears that there wasn't much to notice just that everything was back to normal, and maybe it was just me that felt like I had to pay extreme attention to every detail. Thus, I really liked all the action -which was a lot- and all the visual effects, which personally weren't as great as I hoped for, but for the most part they were really good. Moreover, the acting was also very good, and even though I enjoyed more watching all the originals X-Men instead of the ones from the First Class, which sadly weren't that much on-screen, it was still pretty cool to see both timelines intersect and happen subsequently. That being said, because there was too many characters sometimes it felt like there wasn't enough focus on some of them (Original X-Men members), because it felt like everything happened around the Wolverine and everyone else took second and third place. [**SPOILERS AHEAD**] And so, I would like to mention that the last sequence where everything is back to normal was what I was waiting for all this time, and just to see everything back to normal and everyone together felt right and just they way it should stay, and hopefully continue from there instead and continuing with the past and their younger-selfs. There is a scene after the end of all the credits which shows the future villain of the sequel X-Men: Apocalypse. Although it may be a brief one, it's quite interesting and different."

","Anyone who doesn't want to know few details should stop reading this. My main problem in this movie (which is great) is that sentinels from the future are just too powerful. I mean they are able to hold multiple mutant powers at once, not even Apocalipse was not so mighty. They can heal, turn to flame or ice or diamond..., shoot energy beams, extremely strong... If you ask me, this is just too much for a machine. Also in the future there are not many humans too, because sentinels can detect ability to pass x gene to children. So, people in charge from time to time should be executed because they'll be on turn to pass x genes on to their children. In general I had great time in cinema, but my problem is that I'm trying always to follow logic in the story"
"Vietboi29","8","0","0","28 May 2014"," Great movie
","I really enjoyed this movie. So far this movie beats out Godzilla and Amazing Spider-Man 2 by a landslide. The acting done by James McAvoy is simply top notch. Michael playing as Magneto was alright, didn't really like his character in this one. I do have some quips about this movie though, Warpath is simply useless as a fighter. He does nothing to slow down any of the sentinels, why even give him more screen time than say Iceman or sunspot. They also took away from Blinks abilities. Blink can do more than just open up portals, she can also teleport people and objects as well as parts of people. From the looks of things, she seems to be the only one capable of actually damaging the sentinels, when the portal closed it cut off the arm of the sentinel. Meaning if the director was true to marvel universe, she would've been able to do more damage. Also when did Kitty Pryde obtain a new power? Still over all a good movie, I didn't enjoy the previous x-men movie but did enjoy first class and now this."
"theincrediblehong","8","0","0","28 May 2014"," Intense
","I would still say First Class or X2 is the best X-Men movie, but DOFP is probably the most intense X-Men to date. I also would've preferred a total reboot instead of attempting to have any sort of cohesive storyline with the original movies due to X3's debacle, but they managed to make it work. Having said all this, the time traveling element was believable and the acting is top notch. <br/><br/>There are always some inconsistencies with what powers each individual mutant posses and how they deviate from the comic book (e.g. Shadowcat, Mystique) but they didn't bother me that much. My only suggestion would've been to give the Sentinels a more prominent role in the 1970s storyline. Not only would it have been cool to see more Sentinels, it would explain how certain events in the 1970s could've occurred."
"ChrisChadwick","8","0","0","28 May 2014"," An incredible spectacle. Hard to knock
","This was an incredible film. Multi-faceted, multi-layered, but in no way difficult to follow. The future scenes were the best action scenes I think I've ever seen and they weren't blurred like the bloody Transformers films. You could see what was happening. The acting was very earnest and sincere. I actually felt like these characters meant a lot to each other and what they were doing was real. James MacAvoy (someone please tell Leonardo DiCaprisun to watch James MacAvoy act so he can see how it's really done) was excellent in the tortured role. Michael Fassbender was so fantastically intimidating. For the first time, I actually enjoyed Jennifer Lawrence in a film (and I really enjoyed watching her in this role). I loved seeing Bishop finally. I can't see that complete cardboard cut-out of an actor, Aaron Taylor- Johnson, doing as good a performance of Quicksilver as the young lad here. Toad was believable thankfully. Hugh Jackman did his usual great portrayal of Wolverine. Ellen Page- we really need to see more of Ellen Page. She's a brilliant actress. The 'Sirs' McKellen and Stewart were just fantastic to watch. Halle Berry was enjoyable. I found it difficult watching Colossus get his arse kicked, but the Sentinels were just a magnificent foe. Hard to put any other antagonists above them. they reminded me of the T-1000 from Terminator 2. They were just an completely irresistible force.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, plus sides: The Sentinels Trask Both Magnetos Mystique Both Professor Xs Bishop The portal woman (loved her and I loved the way it made me think of the game 'Portal') The action scenes The storyline (which I really thought was so well thought out) The future scenes Quicksilver Not sure if it was Pyro or The Human Torch, but he was good anyway Even the Iceman was good. The humour was good. I laughed a few times. The film basically kept me smiling throughout (apart from when it was shocking me with revelations and some of the things that happen to my favourite characters)<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>A very high '8/10'<br/><br/>8.9/10<br/><br/>One thing I've noticed in myself as I've reflected on the film is just how tortured Wolverine is. This is the first time I've actually seen the character as such a damaged individual. There is a scene between Prof X and Wolverine, which I originally thought was a little lame (not too lame, but just quite sensitive). But then, when I thought back to the whole film all the way to the end, I actually feel very sorry for the guy. He's like a human guinea pig. Because his body heals, he feel duty- bound, obligated to allow himself to be use for all kinds of destructive procedures. One thing that doesn't regenerate are his emotions. It's almost as though he's saying ""You can't hurt me. I can take it. I can take anything."" But he can't. Not in his mind. If you're reading this review and you haven't watched the film- watch it at your first opportunity."

","After Matthew Vaughn's X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (2011, 7/10) transposes the mutants' universe into 1960s and allows some new blood to play their younger selves, X-MEN series has officially opened a new chapter. Three years later, the original helmer (X-MEN 2000, 7/10 and X2 2003, 7/10) Bryan Singer returns to the director chair to push a reset button to nullify all the damages done by Brett Ratner's X-MEN: THE LAST STAND (2006, 7/10). In this latest episode, the story devises a time-travel mission to the past in order to save the entire world from the Sentinel apocalypse. <br/><br/>With many cast members of the first three X-MEN movies reprise their roles, fanboys will hurrah to welcome back McKellen and Steward pair as the old Magneto and Professor X, with their disciples Storm (Berry), Kitty Pryde (Page), Iceman (Ashmore) and a handful of new characters in the near future, facing their common enemy, a robot army composed of killing machines named Sentinels, originally designed by Dr. Bolivar Trask (Dinklage) to obliterate mutants, but things go out of line, an indiscriminate massacre is endangering the whole planet. <br/><br/>So they send Wolverine (Jackman) back in 1972 to stop the Trask assassin executed by Mystique (Lawrence) would directly spur the advance of the prototype Sentinel maturing into the indestructible destroyer. And the paralleled worlds engage a race against the clock, the impending doom vs. the eleventh-hour history-shifting decision. <br/><br/>One much-hyped staple of the franchise is the frenemy between Professor X and Magneto, under a more liberal context now, the younger two (played by McAvoy and Fassbender respectively) construes a more (b)romance-inclining attachment to incite devotees' enthusiasm, yet this time around, McAvoy gains the upper hand with a tough inward struggle to crucify, through a fictional vis-à-vis with his older self, his character has a transcendent enlightenment while Fassbender is recycling the same character from the previous chapter with more flashy CGI- laden spectacles.<br/><br/>Wolverine is the nominal leading role, but in fact, he doesn't have too much action sequences to handle and is cast away before the crux arrives, Mystique, thanks to Lawrence's current much marketable star power, becomes the game-changing MVP amongst all the participants. As a Chinese, I cannot overlook the red-hot Bingbing Fan is cast as Blink, finally a role with sensible potential for her Hollywood moonlighting. Also worth mentioning, Evan Peters' Quicksilver steals the limelight with his time-frozen exploit makes THE MATRIX trilogy's bullet time pales in comparison. <br/><br/>The film is a tightly orchestrated by a cliff-hanging urgency, accompanied with a cogent script maximally facilitates the story development to be assimilated even by a novice in the mutants club. A great art design accomplishment to restore the 70s milieu, while the make-believe future settings are ominously fashioned as a video game production.<br/><br/>The franchise is consistent in my rating system, a 7/10 is a tremendous achievement considering I am not a comic book adherent, and the promising ending beckons a pristine start is on the horizon since everyone survives the forbidding annihilation, a solid building block cements more excitement will ensue in the follow-up X-MEN: APOCALYPSE in a two-year span."

","X-MEN has been called the ""thinking people comic"" and there is a lot of truth on that. It is as dark as Batman and full of fantasy as Superman but not shallow as both. <br/><br/>X-MEN concept is a profound and not easy to work; racism and power struggle. It is quite interesting but requires lots of character and situation development, drama and action in equal parts. <br/><br/>My belief is that the franchise never got the popularity of Batman or Iron Man was because of Mr. Bryan Singer lousy direction. <br/><br/>The universe of the mutants is a crowd of characters but Mr. Singer is unable to work with more than two or three in the first line or developing complex dramatic situations without sorting out with FX.<br/><br/>Days of Future Past is another example of his lack of control.<br/><br/>As in his two previous movies; many mutants beloved characters are just shown for a couple of seconds doing almost nothing; Storm, Shadowcat, Iceman barely have a couple of lines; but this times even Stewart and McKellen has almost nothing to do (McKellen looks bored and uncomfortable in his very few scenes). Quicksilver gets a few minutes of screen time, does his thing and is send away for the rest of the movie. During his scenes the other characters has little to do.<br/><br/>The script is good enough to cover most of Mr. Singer errors; but some things just do not make any sense:<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT ***** After losing Vietnam; do not believe Mr. Nixon will avoid a conflict with mutants, specially if one mutant is able to move a baseball stadium to surround the White House. Such power showdown should immediately provoke the mutants persecution. <br/><br/>Dinklage character (Dr. Trask is not clearly defined); he is a different kind of mutant but is also an ambitious and greedy person. Why try to put him as an idealist ?.<br/><br/>Young Magneto is pretty much a psycho during the movie. Most of his actions do not make any sense; while the old one gives his life to save the others.<br/><br/>Raven / Mystique internal conflict is lame and could have been easily solved in much less screen time. She is a killer so why try to make her a nice person ?. Perhaps the projected spin off ?<br/><br/>*****END OF SPOILERS ******<br/><br/>There are many more errors; like the negation of X-MEN Last Stand; the one directed by Brett Ratner when Singer decided to make the boring Superman Reboot in 2006.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus directed the first two Harry Potter's movies; but then realized he was not ready to handle the tone of the book so he pass the baton to Cuaron and then to other directors.

","Speaking as someone whose life began in 1973; I found this movie particularly worth seeing.<br/><br/>The dysopian future's visual effects were very good. Some action sequences were disappointing - particularly Bishop's. If all he does is shoot a gun once every scene when someone gives him energy he can't be expected to be very effective. The storyline was OK; but some of the hallmark flashbacks of previous X-MEN films were a little unnecessary. Each film from the 2000 film to now must stand on their own two feet. But since this is a time-travel movie; I would guess that it makes some kind of sense. I half-expected the scene where Logan almost loses the connection he has with the past - to accidentally learn his entire past and recover his full memory through Xavier's mental link between his two younger and older selves.<br/><br/>Hopefully the next film X-MEN Apocalypse deals with my favorite X-MEN Storyline Arc: Beyond Good And Evil.

","An entertaining return to the Marvel world of the X-Men with a fairly straightforward plot and a very good cast. It is rare for a movie to unfold exactly as it seems in the previews but this one seems to have done just that. There are NOT a ton of surprises here. The movie unfolds very similarly to how I expected. The future is dire, and transporting Logan's (Jackman) consciousness to the 70's seems to be the last hope for mankind. Professor X (Stewart), Magneto (Mackella), and Storm (Berry) (along with some new mutants and some alumni from X-men 3) return for what is most likely their last hurrah as X-men as I feel another film with these folk may seem campy and a bit unlikely. They hold up in a structure to protect Wolverine's body as his consciousness attempts to save the day back in the 70's. Back in the 70's, Charles, (McAvoy) Erik, (Fassbender) Hank (Hoult), and Raven/Mystique (Lawrence) have their own issues and agendas until Logan shows up with a different agenda, stop someone from killing someone, and save the future. They don't all perk up with happiness and unity to this news however, and the linear cause and effect notion of time travel is not always so simple, as sometimes changing something in the past will course correct and not really change, or possibly change the future for the worse. The time travel notion however does not get overly complicated here, and Singer does a GREAT job at implementing it, and not blowing audiences mind so they can't understand the basic nature of the story. <br/><br/>What was missing for me was a bit more action. There IS action here mind you, in the beginning, at the end, but not a ton in the middle. I was hoping for a tad more Wolverine excitement as well. His character was present in almost the entire movie, but his lame claws in the 70's, and the lack of need for him to fight was a downer. Especially when he most likely had to stay in supreme shape for a cool year with the back to back filming of ""Wolverine"" and this film. Charles, Erik and he spend a lot of time running around in 70's clothes. Even Beast gets more action than Wolverine this time around which I found disappointing. One of the best sequences is the rescue attempt of Erik from a prison, with new mutant Quicksilver (Evan Peters). It is refreshing, humorous, and entertaining, and I wish the film had a couple more of these moments. These were my main concerns, and as an entire film, and a comic book one at that, this one does not fail to deliver. It is the BEST movie of the summer so far."

My only job is to judge what I saw on screen. And what I saw on screen was a film which, in my opinion, currently ranks as one of the greatest superhero movies set in the Marvel universe.<br/><br/>Synopsis: In a not too distant post apocalyptic future, where most mutants have been eradicated, Wolverine (Huge Jackman) Professor X (Patrick Stewart) Magneto (Ian McKellen) Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) Storm (Halle Berry) and a few other (lesser) superheroes find themselves cornered, with enemies quickly approaching. These new enemies are called Sentinels and they are the brainchild of Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). These mutant hunting robots where obviously designed to seek out and destroy all mutants and more importantly constructed in such a way that, in large groups, they are virtually unbeatable. With death assuredly in their near future, the surviving X-Men's only choice is to send Wolverine back in time (for some reason, with no clothes on) to the inception of the Sentinel (the 1970's) in order to reunite young Professor X (James McAvoy) young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and find a way to modify history; hence the title. And before I move on, I must take a moment to say that, yes, the acting from top to bottom was as good as the star studded line up would have you believe.<br/><br/>You can go ahead and forget about ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (the two films which nearly killed the once proud X-Men franchise). Brought back from an eleven year hiatus to direct this X-Men/""X-Men: First Class"" tie-together, through impressive direction, with the help of a strong screenplay (containing just the right amount of characters) from Simon Kinberg, Bryan Singer fully reestablishes the X-Men franchise as the best superhero movie franchise still running. So, whether or not Singer is found guilty of the alleged teenage sexual abuse of Michael Egan, the man knows his way around an X-Men movie. TOO SOON! In ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" I recognized a lot of the same aspects that once had me proclaiming ""X-Men"" and ""X2"" to be my favorite superhero movies of all time (before the arrival of the Dark Knight series, of course). Displaying clever banter between fully realized characters, a superb storyline full of social subtext while finding a nice balance between campy dramatization and Dark Knight seriousness, action packed visuals stemming from a variety of superheroes with a variety of super powers, accented with some skilled direction, and new and innovative ways to intertwine Marvel history with actual historical events, the amount of thought and care put into this production was palpable.<br/><br/>Final Thought: If I wanted to make this review even longer, I could wax on about the set design, which is pretty award worthy in and of itself. Or I could write another 700 words on how brilliantly choreographed the Jim Croce scored Quicksilver fight sequence was. But by this time you've undoubtedly made up your mind as to whether or not you will be going to see ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"". So I'll leave you with one last note: If you know what you're seeing, the post credits teaser will be the greatest so far. And for those of you think I'm wrong, please don't defend your argument by bringing up that stupid Avengers shawarma scene."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","0","26 May 2014"," A great ""X-Men"" entry, but more so an entire ""X-Men"" series game-changer
","In a post-""Avengers"" comic book movie universe, bigger is not only better, but also necessary. Leave it to original ""X-Men"" and ""X2"" director Bryan Singer to get the whole gang together (old and new) in order to bring one of the biggest ""X-Men"" story lines to the big screen in attention-grabbing fashion. ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" finally establishes an ""X- Men"" universe for 20th Century Fox in the same way ""The Avengers"" galvanized Marvel Studios' cinematic universe.<br/><br/>Uniting the cast of ""X-Men: First Class"" with those of the original trilogy, ""Days of Future Past"" takes us into the not-too-distant future with mutant-kind on the brink of extinction at the hands of Sentinels, mutant-hunting machines that adapt to the mutants they are fighting. A band of mutants including Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Bishop (Omar Sy), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) and others has harnessed the ability to travel through time by sending someone's consciousness to a younger version of themselves. When they meet up with Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Ian McKellen) and others, they determine that using this ability to prevent the events that led to the creation of the Sentinels is their only hope, and only Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) could withstand traveling that far back in time. <br/><br/>In the '70s at the close of the Vietnam War, Wolverine seeks out a troubled Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) living with Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult). Together they must find Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), who has plans to kill the creator of the Sentinels, Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), which is the very act that catalyzes the Sentinels' creation. To do so, they must team up with Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and stop her.<br/><br/>Lots of characters to keep track of, but anyone who has kept up with the franchise will have little trouble making sense of it all, plus it is very cool to see all these mutants in the same film. Whereas ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" overdosed on all these mutants, ""Days of Future Past"" handles it much better. Writer Simon Kinberg (who learned from the flaws of that film, which he co-wrote) divides the action into two categories: the desolate future when mutants fight for their lives, and the past, with that entire plot line focused on finding Mystique and rewriting history.<br/><br/>The characters involved in the past are far less numerous than the characters in the future scenes, which is the secret to success for ""Days of Future Past."" Rather than let numbers of mutants muddle the quality of the ones that matter most, they are used in small bursts to add to the magnitude and excitement of the film. The core of the story involves young Xavier, Magneto, Wolverine, Beast and Mystique. That's it. <br/><br/>As such, the themes that made ""First Class"" such a success are here again. Xavier and Magneto's ideologies collide in the face of this greater enemy, with Mystique caught in the middle. Xavier must wrestle with his demons and Wolverine must take on the role of team leader rather than marching to the beat of his own drum like usual. <br/><br/>Singer's return to the director's chair proves essential in so far as getting dozens of actors to play along and gluing what were many disparate ""X-Men"" movie components into one entry that really sets the course for the franchise going forward. The action is great, including both the gritty Sentinel fights and the more creative set pieces including a sequence in which a young Quicksilver (Evan Peters) speedily saves his fellow mutants from certain death while listening to Jim Croce's ""Time in a Bottle,"" but this is a movie that dazzles more in scope than in spectacle. <br/><br/>Given the sheer scale of this effort, ""Days of Future Past"" doesn't look as good on a microscopic level. Unifying the entire ""X-Men"" franchise necessitates leaving behind plenty of inconsistencies with the other films, not to mention the time travel plot has its own holes (a fault of time travel films in general, to be fair). So the movie relies a lot on the mutant dazzle effect in addition to a plot that creates dire and immediate consequences for the ""X-Men"" universe we've come to know in the last 15 years.<br/><br/>Fox course-corrected the ""X-Men"" brand with ""First Class,"" but now they've bridged the gap between this new direction and the old movies (not to mention the Wolverine spin-offs). In 2011, we thought the franchise had essentially undergone a reboot; now, we see it all as one in the same, and the ""X-Men"" universe can expand even more with the right guidance (preferably Singer's). <br/><br/>The fact that ""Days of Future Past"" works well as its own film while also serving a far greater role for the entire franchise is a feat that can't be understated, especially from Fox, which has struggled with its consistency in comic book films. It won't unanimously be labeled the best of the five ""X-Men"" movies, but it will unquestionably be brought up in that conversation for fans of the genre. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"jaredmartin-464-711711","9","0","0","26 May 2014"," X-Men DOFP Unites the Series Together
","X-Men: DOFP had a tough task of expanding the X-men universe, combining the old series, with the new, and had to convincingly explain away some of the series continuity errors, with a complex time travel plot. This could've equaled a recipe for disaster, but instead this latest X-Men film mostly succeeds. In fact it succeeds not only as a sequel that ties the two (originally) separate series together, but also manages to fix some of the things that X-Men: The Last Stand handled poorly.<br/><br/>X-Men: DOFP is first and, foremost a great sequel, that is action packed, with enough emotion, and humor, that makes it arguably the best X-Men film thus far. This is because these characters have been setup in multiple prior films, so that by the time this film comes along, we get to see some of these characters, and their arcs, become fully realized. The film focuses mainly on Xavier/Charles, Magneto/Erik, Mystique/Raven, Wolverine/Logan, and to some extent Beast/Hank. There are many brief moments of other mutants, who get their moment to shine as well. Most notably is a new mutant named Peter Maximoff aka Quicksilver, who steals every moment of screen time he gets. The prison break scene with Quicksilver, is one of the best scenes in a comic book film, while both comical, and visually brilliant. The point of this film is to change the future by altering the past. The film starts off in a post apocalyptic future, where both mutants, and humans have been nearly wiped out by Terminator-like robots called Sentinels.<br/><br/>Wolverine is sent back in time to the year 1973, where he must find a younger Charles Xavier, and Magneto, to help stop Mystique from killing a man named Bolivar Trask. Trask is the creator of the Sentinels, and his murder sets things in motion that will lead to the eventual demise of mutants, and humans alike. None of this film's main characters in the past are at their best, and need a push to be a better version of themselves, and it's up to Wolverine to be patient, and help them along, in order to change the course of time, which as Logan states ""Patience isn't my strongest suit"". The tale is a bleak one, but never devoid of humor, which makes the film fun, but also helps keeps it's characters feeling genuine. Thats the best strength DOFP has, you care about whats going on, and wan't to see these characters that are beloved fans, make it out of this alive.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, this movie does ""fix"" some of the continuity problems the series had, and also resurrects a few characters, that were lost to soon. The ending of the film really pays off, and left me very happy, not just because of seeing old characters back, but because everything up to that point was compelling, and emotionally resonate. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who's a fan of the series, or is just a fan of good storytelling, and interesting characters. There's a couple minor pacing issues here, and there, and some may argue certain characters don't get enough screen time, but overall X-Men: DOFP delivers, and is a fantastic return to the X-men series old, and new."

","By far the best X-Men movie to date.... <br/><br/>While it diverges from the official comic book story line, the plot is still the same. Robots have decimated the human and mutant population and taken over the world! While that comes as no surprise to die hard fans of the franchise, this movie is finally the one we have been waiting for since the franchise started. It's almost a do-over in a way because it corrects many many many of the mistakes of the first two films. For instance Storm no longer spouts cheesy lines before activating her powers; Magneto is the powerhouse he always should have been; and Hugh Jackman finally shows us a decent portrayal of Wolverine on screen. F-I-N-A-L-L-Y<br/><br/>This movie has breathed new life into a franchise I thought would never be done right on screen; and in doing so, it has set the stage for the coming of the Age of Apocalypse by making the mutant presence known to the entire world. Thank you Marvel & Bryan Singer for proving me wrong!"

","26 May 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - X-Men Days of Future Past.

I could use lots of fancy phrases but the word ""stonking"" comes to mind. With just the right length of introduction into the story this film grabs you right from the beginning as it prepares you to witness perhaps the ultimate battle between the humans and the mutants, and the most difficult battle raging between the mutants themselves. Wolverine is sent into the past to try to change history and oddly really suited the 70s, also who of us ladies wouldn't be pleased to see Hugh Jackman in the altogether.

","I must say I lost all hope so the X-Men movie franchise for awhile. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say I'm more of a DC fan than Marvel...BUT After seeing the latest Wolverine in theaters, I realized this is my childhood right here. X-men, Batman, Spider-man, and all the other epic characters. I've hated Marvel so much for no real reason? I hate myself for bashing Marvel the past 15-20 years but I must say Marvel has been good to me as of late and this latest X-Men movie was perfect. I enjoyed it from start to finish (credit finish ;]) There wasn't anything bad about this film at all. I loved how each X-Men character just didn't give two craps about using their powers for once in the fight scenes and just went all out. It made me feel like a kid again, and it felt like I was watching the cartoon again after school. I can't wait for whatever it is they do next. I believe Marvel and DC can share the same spot in my heart with no fuss. If you're a fan of Marvel and the X-Men then this movie won't disappoint. Great movie overall!"
"veensepeper","9","0","0","26 May 2014"," Redemption complete!
","The X-Men franchise Brian Singer started, delivered us two great movies before spiraling a path downwards. X3 - the first X-Movie without Singer writing or directing - did not have what it takes storywise and had a mishmash of a plot. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is a movie best to be forgotten, almost bringing the X-franchise to its death. Then, with ""First Class"" and ""The Wolverine"" a road to redemption was taken, and reached its destiny in ""Days of Future Past"".<br/><br/>It's a thrill from beginning to end. Hearing the original theme music again felt like coming home, and then the movie itself: excellent.<br/><br/>We meet some new mutants, some familiar mutants, and however some of them gets cast aside too quickly - none of them feel redundant. The movie provides us lots of action, without stalling plot advancements.<br/><br/>Offcourse, it's not a flawless movie. It is never explained how Kitty Pryde acquired her new skill to send peoples minds into younger versions of themselves. Again, it's a Wolverine-centered movie... Apart from ""first class"" he never gets to take a back seat and thus upstaging other mutants. Granted, the plot points out a necessity for him to be the one who time-travels. And even with the time traveling, some of the plot holes established in earlier movies were not fixed.<br/><br/>However, in itself, this movie is brilliant. And even if not all plot holes get fixed, at least you leave the theater feeling that they did. Elaborating on all this brings me into spoiler territory, which is where I don't want to go. I would love for you to go see it and form your own opinion. Go do that now!"
"jolojavier22","9","0","0","26 May 2014"," The X-ceptional X-Men Film that Ensures the Future of the Franchise!
","The most ambitious and the most anticipated X-men film of the year, X-Men Days of Future Past, has successfully won over the critics and the fans worldwide! It's really that good! Just so you know, I've been a fan of the X-Men ever since the days of ""The Animated Series"". I've also read most of the comics, and have watched all the previously released X-Men films throughout the past decade. In my opinion, this is by far the most satisfying and most rewarding X-Men movie yet. Let me tell you why.<br/><br/>First, the combination of the casts from the original X-Men Trilogy and the new First Class is a wise decision by Fox. Since Marvel has successfully established their Cinematic Universe and has set a trend for future superhero movies, it's high time that Fox creates it's own cinematic universe too. What other better way to do it than with the well known X-Men property? As you will see after watching the movie, the end result is truly remarkable! One of the main highlights of the film is the undeniable chemistry between the actors James McAvoy (Charles Xavier) and Michael Fassbender (Magneto) that has been carried over from First Class. Their portrayal of their respective characters is believable and truly well done. It's also nice to see Patrick Stewart (Future Charles Xavier) and Ian McKellen (Future Magneto) from the trilogy add that necessary balance to those characters relationship. Let's not forget as well the stellar performances from Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Peter Dinklage (Bolivar Trask). These are the core characters you should keep your eyes on.<br/><br/>Second, is the brilliant direction of Bryan Singer. At first, I'm very skeptical about the time-traveling plot of the film and that Singer may not be able to make it work, but I was utterly mistaken. The plot actually works, and everything else just falls into place at the end of the movie. There's also that perfect blend of action, drama, suspense, and humor, and momentum build up throughout the film until that explosive climax. He'll surely keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The dialogues are also well thought of, they're witty, and memorable, and surely doesn't sound cliché. Another thing I'd like to mention is that I agree with his decision to remove some extraneous scenes, and even resort to cutting out Rogue's (Anna Paquin) rescue scene to keep the film's progression better, (as if too much isn't happening already to add that).<br/><br/>Last but not the least, is the eye candy effects that will make your jaw drop and your body tingly. The effects in this film is truly fascinating. Just seeing those huge sentinels face off against the X-men is already worth paying for alone. But one breakout character of the film that you should definitely watch out for is Quicksilver (Evan Peters). Singer made this character lovable and entertaining to watch, as opposed to the dark atmosphere of the film. No wonder why the film had a budget of $200 million. We know now where most of that expenses went to.<br/><br/>All in all, X-Men Days of Future Past is the X-ceptional X-Men movie of the year that you definitely shouldn't miss. Whether yo're a fan of the X-Men or not, if action-packed movies with a great plot are up your alley, I highly recommend you watch this. As this film has set a new standard for future superhero movies."

","First let me say that DoFP is a good movie, and you should see it if you're a fan. Much like Transcendence, however, there are some small things that totally ruin the rest of it.<br/><br/>1) The train scene with Magneto looks like absolute garbage - seriously, with an estimated budget of 200 million, you would expect the CG effects to look better than a indie film.<br/><br/>2) Quicksilver looks to be about 20 - and if you're a fan, you know that he's Magneto's son (vaguely implied by one line in the movie) - but Magneto himself looks to be somewhere between 30 and 35 (kudos Fassbender) so they should have chosen a younger actor for Quicksilver.<br/><br/>3) Again with the CG effects that look like they were generated in a toilet after a night of heavy boozing and tacos, the scene where Magneto is approaching the Pentagon... Also, his one-liner ""do what you were made for"" is outright stupid scripting, considering that he is the one controlling the thing that he is talking to.<br/><br/>Otherwise a great movie!"
"YetAnotherMovieReviewer","7","0","0","26 May 2014"," Good But Not Great
","Review Score - 7/10<br/><br/>To quote another beloved reviewer's opening lines, I just watched X-Men: Days of Future Past last night and it was thankfully better than godzilla. It's not a great film but for what it's worth it balances the story pretty well. I'm a fan of superheros and their superpowers and you definitely get some great moments and new characters introduced here that show off what people love about X-Men, especially in the opening which was a good way to introduce the film. The standout here was Quicksilver who really provided a likability and genuine humour to his character. The special fx was great in the film and the storyline wasn't too difficult to follow but entertaining enough to enjoy. It's cast very well and the emotional grips between Charles and Eric keep the film going. The villains here were really the sentinels and I think they nailed their part in showing of how brutal they are which is exactly what they needed to be.<br/><br/>The things that didn't work in the film come down to some plot inconsistencies and choices. You have quicksilver who was the most likable character and after his sequence his done, he's reduced down to nothing for the rest of the film. Like really? Firstly, having him not only makes it more entertaining but it also would provide more logical sense than bringing beast. The guy can essentially slow down time and would essentially make a lot of the conflicts non-existent in the way their played out. I'm not saying that having him there is always going to make any problem an easy fix but it seems a bit lazy not coming up with a scenario where that is the case, even at the end you could have magneto bringing him down by controlling the metal that's on his clothes. And when Magneto is gunning to kill Raven, he shoots her in the leg well knowing that her blood is going to be spilled and collected anyways if he killed her makes the whole point of killing her useless. And lastly I know I'm being nitpicky but they're several times where the remote that detects mutants which happens to be standing several feet next to mutants doesn't go off?! Really?<br/><br/>It's clear Singer decided to throw out some of the logical sense of the film (especially when you're trying to think back of when events that happened in previous films take place) and that's what takes a bit out of a great rating. Nonetheless, it's an enjoyable ride and still a good film."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","0","26 May 2014"," Complex choreography but immense fun
","Including ""The Wolverine"", this is the seventh outing for the X-Men of the Marvel Comics franchise and Bryan Singer who helmed the first two, is back as director. He's not the only one who's back. Thanks to a time travel plot, we have both the old (Patrick Stewart) and the new (James McAvoy) Charles Xavier/Professor X and the old (Ian McKellen) and the new (Michael Fassbender) Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Fassbender is my favourite of this talented quartet). Lots of others return too: Wolverine, Mystique, Storm, Beast, Iceman, and more beside. So there are a plenitude of characters and powers on display here.<br/><br/>That's not all. a complicated narrative means that we have good mutants, bad mutants, past mutants, future mutants, one who manages to be in both the future and the past, and another who contrives to have a conversation between his past and future selves. Are you still following me? Do pay attention at the back.<br/><br/>So it's not always clear exactly what's going on in this complex choreography, but it is loads of fun with some terrific scenes even in the 2D format in which I (deliberately) chose to watch it. I especially enjoyed a freeze-time scene where a mutant called Quicksilver gets to do his stuff and a sequence in which Magneto raises an entire game stadium before putting it to original use. Now it's three years since Jennifer Lawrecne took over the role of Raven/Mystique from Rebecca Romijn and, in that time, Lawrence has become a major star, so it's not surprising that in this movie she is given a bigger role and it is a delight to see her in action."

","With an ensemble cast and such a brobdingnagian doze of X-men, Days of Future Past works wonders with the screenplay and the screen time that all x-men share. The X-men, ushering in their mutant traits to complement the visual effects, go berserk fighting their invincible nemesis The Sentinels. The action, neither too boisterous nor mundane is a tempting and titillating. Hugh Jackman and Jennifer Lawrence anchor the plot cogently. Its a Mystique/Raven cum Wolverine show that centrifuges an entertaining solution of thrill as events in the past are mutilated to save the future and render it secure. The constant fear of the future being delved into darkness keeps up the interest. Magneto's mettle outshines. All in all the ride back to future is a compelling one, joyous and enjoyable !"

","I just saw the movie earlier today and I was impressed. I'm a big X-Men fan and I've seen the X-Men franchise just get better with age. This movie was very intense and it started off right. Much like X-Men 2 started with a serious battle and nice display of mutant abilities, Days of Future Past does the same. Of course the CGI is incredible, but the movie was more than that. They brought a lot of intensity much like they did in The Last Stand. Naturally, we were treated to some new mutants such as Bishop and Quicksilver.<br/><br/>The movie was done well. There were several layers to the story, but it was done in a way that it wasn't over baked nor were there many plot holes. The way the story was done it left itself open to be picked apart with inconsistencies, but they seamlessly tied all of the X-Men movies together into this one.<br/><br/>This was very edgy, serious, and at times comedic. This was a solid follow up to the last X-Men."

","I am extremely pleased with what Fox has done with this franchise, starting with X-Men: First Class, through The Wolverine and now this film. Redemption and moving back in the right direction, towards what it was in the beginning. This one is a tremendous experience, a culmination of a decade and a half of character development and social and emotional themes. Days of Future Past is a very powerful story that is both vast and intimate.<br/><br/>Without droning on, the story is a classic, spanning decades and incorporating some historical fiction with futuristic science fiction. But the characters are at the core, and this is such a brilliant, incredible group of actors. McAvoy, Lawrence, Jackman, Fassbender, Stewart, McKellan, Dinklage...the list just goes on. And there are some great performances in this film. Some incredibly moving moments.<br/><br/>Visually, it's jaw-droppingly rendered, from the 1970s past to the dark future. There are so many different types of scenes and looks. In a way, this is like the Cloud Atlas of X-Men movies, and I mean that in the best way possible. (This is far easier to keep track of than Cloud Atlas, rest assured of that, but they share a similarity in different groups of people in different times and places all being tied into the same theme.)<br/><br/>Why do I not give it a perfect ten out of ten? Well, there were a few small things that I think could have been improved, such as a line of dialog here or something else there. Also, the climactic scene contained something that I can only make sense of as a ""let's include a huge visual effect"" move. But any complaints are just drops in the ocean, really.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an incredible thing. The amount of resources involved here is astounding. And fortunately, it works. This film is what it was meant to be, an ultimate-level storyline that is breathtaking in scope without losing the personal character moments that make it all worthwhile and give it its real power. There will surely be more X-Men films to come, but for now, this is a very fitting, heartswelling way to take fourteen years and six previous films' worth of universe-building and bring it all back around in a most satisfying way. Highly, highly, highly recommended."

"Raveesh_Kulshrestha","5","5","16","23 May 2014"," X-cuse-it-Men: Over abused story, lame action and a wasted Wolverine!
","I will keep this review short.<br/><br/>I have never been a fan of this mutant fight-club franchise, but 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' reinstated my interest in this series. But yes, it was Matthew Vaughn who set the benchmark and hit gold for me with his 'First Class' direction. Except for Bryan Singer who has delivered three in this series, others have been one time 'come-direct-go' directors and must I say they have done a much better job than Bryan in whatever they have delivered thus far in the series. Let me come straight to the point - I feel Bryan's direction simply lacks that sheer punch and intensity that is required from the X-Men factory. Same was the case with his 'Superman Returns'. His work lacks the excitement factor.<br/><br/>Talking about 'Days of future past' - the movie suffers from a very stale and an age old story line within the first fifteen minutes of which, you know what the movie is all about, and you see Wolverine travel back in time to change 'history'. There is not even a single action sequence which makes you feel wow, forget being at the edge of your seat. Bryan has included a lot of emotions into his characters and story but I am sorry to say, they drag the story to an almost standstill pace, boring most of the times. I at one time felt moving out of the theater! Second half totally belongs to Mystique and Magneto with Wolverine and Professor being mere spectators, and that's how it ends. Not worth the buck! Avoid! PS: I would recommend Godzilla if haven't seen it yet, rather than DOFP. Even though Godzilla is not the summer blockbuster that we waited for this year, but still it is miles ahead in terms of keeping you glued to your seats."
"Brettyboy007","5","3","8","7 July 2014"," Loved it...until the cop out ending.
","When I heard X-Men: Days of Future Past was going to feature Sentinels for the first time in the franchise, I was ecstatic. I love sentinels. I grew up reading the X-Men comics and seeing these behemoths come to life on the comic pages. And I must admit, I was very satisfied with the way they looked. I went to see this with my friend and he was excited about them too.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong by the vote. I love X-Men. I've seen every one of them except for The Wolverine. The whole series has been very well done for a Marvel comic. The plot could be hard for some people to get but basically in a nutshell: It is the future and sentinels have hunted down all mutants and so the group sends Wolverine back to 1973 to stop an event that will unleash the sentinels and cause hell for mutants worldwide. Hugh Jackman did an excellent job as Wolverine. We get introduced to a couple new characters such as Bolivar Trask, and Quicksilver among other mutants.<br/><br/>I won't say anymore about the plot, but it is a intense ride throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>Now on to the only reason this movie deserves a C rating: The ending. I HATED it. I mean it with capital letters. I won't spoil it, but I will say the ending could leave a lot of you upset like me. I found out later on the reason why the ending was the way it was, and just...damn. Why Bryan Singer? Why?<br/><br/>I don't understand why this is in IMDb's top 250.<br/><br/>P.S. There is a scene in the ending credits."

Personally, I've seen enough of Jennifer Lawrence. For my taste, she's over rated and over exposed and I much preferred Rebecca Romijn in the Mystique role. I was disappointed in much the same way as the replacement of Katie Holmes with Maggie Gyllenhaal in the Batman franchise. Ellen Page annoys me. I must have missed something ... how did Dr. X come back from the dead ?

","I've heard a lot of buzz for this movie and so my anticipation for this movie was really high. When the movie was over, I was blown away by how good this movie was. It's not only a good comic book movie, but it is a GOOD MOVIE in general. I think that anyone of all movie genre will enjoy X-men Days of Future Past. The depth surrounding the characters were really great. Not all of the mutants had a lot of screen time but the amount that they were given, it was enough for the audience to get a grasp of the character and to feel the characters emotions. There were a few scenes that were very funny, but it did not take you out of the movie so it was added in so seamlessly. The going back into the future and going back to the present was done so well, as a audience you really focused on the movie, it did not distract you from the story line, it was very easy to follow, even if you were not a x-men fanatic. I will be going back to the movies to watch this 3 more times at least, because it is that good"
"3xHCCH","9","3","8","21 May 2014"," Starting All Over Again
","Powerful Sentinels from Trask Industries were decimating all the mutants, leaving only a handful of the hardiest ones alive. Logan is sent back twenty years into the past during the inception of the Sentinel program, to stop this project before it destroys the mutant race anymore.<br/><br/>Young Charles Xavier was up and about but without his powers. Young Eric was incarcerated in a subterranean cell within the Pentagon because on his implication in the JFK assassination. Young Raven/Mystique was intent to kill Trask himself before he kills more mutants. Logan must make them all see how their actions now will impact on the very existence of mutants on Earth in the future.<br/><br/>Because this is already the fifth X-Men film, we know each mutant individually and are invested in their collective mythology. This installment gives us further details into the past of each of the main mutants and we see how each one evolves into how we know them in the present time.<br/><br/>The visual effects are expectedly awesome. My favorite scene would be the sequence where Charles and Logan attempt to break Eric out if his prison with the help of the super- speed powers of Peter/Quicksilver. The stop-motion, sense of humor and the song ""Time in a Bottle"" in the background makes it very memorable. The other epic sequence was that when an entire sports arena was lifted from its foundations and used to corral the White House itself.<br/><br/>The actors we know and loved from all the previous films: Hugh Jackman (as Logan/Wolverine), Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy (as Charles Xavier, old and young), Ian McKellen and Michael Fassbender (as Eric/Magneto, old and young), Jennifer Lawrence (as Raven/Mystique) -- all do excellently in their respective characters. Nicholas Hoult reprises his role as young Hank McCoy/Beast. There will be shorter and shocking appearances by Halle Berry and Anna Paquin as Storm and Rogue, respectively. Towards the end, there will be surprising cameos by Mutants who had taken already their leave in previous episodes<br/><br/>For the new cast members, Evan Peters shines in his outstanding performance as Quicksilver, a character who was both quick in action and in wit. Ellen Page appears as Kitty Foyle, whose power made it possible for Logan to travel back in time. Newly-featured mutants Bishop (Omar Sy) and Blink (Bingbing Fan) get prominent action sequences in the climactic battle sequence.<br/><br/>I thought it was an inspired idea to cast Peter Dinklage as the genius scientist Trask. He brings his ""Games of Thrones"" acting intensity into this film in this dark character. It was also interesting to see how Stryker got his sinister character into the X-Men canons. Josh Helman portrays him with the necessary antagonistic swagger.<br/><br/>As with the other Marvel films, do wait up for a breathtaking short extra clip of a robed figure in and the Pyramids. This bonus scene teasing the next X-Men film Apocalypse (2016) is seen only after all the credits roll up.<br/><br/>This film had so many characters (even former US President Nixon plays a key part) and so many events shuttling from present to past and back. Despite all the potential plot holes a time-travel storyline can present, Director Bryan Singer still manages to tell his story in one cohesive whole. This is yet another excellent proof that the X-Men film franchise is indeed the best among the Marvel collection. 9/10."
"keboozer","5","4","13","25 May 2014"," Days of Future Boring.
","I actually just made an account to review this movie because I was so utterly disappointed. I went in with such high hopes, and after watching about half the movie I realized it was a flop. With the addition of Bishop and the other new mutants I thought this movie was going to be epic for the X-series. However, it turned out to be just a bunch of cameo appearances that added to the story without explanation.<br/><br/>If you have ever watched the 'Days of Future Past' episode from the X-Men cartoon series you will even be more disappointed with this movie. Not sure what the deal is with Bolivar Trask being a little person, but I really didn't like that addition since I am a die-hard X-Men fan. The movie had quite a bit of action but the plot was bland and boring, not to mention the fact that Storm, Colossus, Iceman, etc had little to do with the actual movie.<br/><br/>I was also not impressed with the make-up and design of the sentinels, but that it not as big a deal as some of the plot problems with the movie. I felt like it was more of a movie about Mystique than anything. With her defying the laws of physics with every kick and punch, I get tired of seeing her character portrayed as a massively tough mutant. All in all it was a decent movie, but with all the hype and trailers that I watched I expected much, much more from this film. If you go in and have a lot of knowledge about X-Men, you probably will be disappointed. If you just watch the X-Men Series movies you will probably love it."

"chaos-rampant","Null","3","9","9 September 2014"," Samey apocalypse
","God, another one of these superhero juggernauts. Perhaps other viewers find each one so much different than all the other Marvel clones, I don't know. They're all a big blur of samey rush to me. I don't find real invention going on in any of them, any freshness in the mythos, any actual difference (which is touted as the big theme here). You'll know this is just tired by the whole apocalyptic / time-travel storyline. <br/><br/>So another attempt to construct fate; there's something wrong about humanity at large and where we're headed as a race, in the film this culminates (in the beginning) with humanity defeated at the hands of our own desire to root out difference, and the effort to reconstruct the past, we land back in Nixon's America where things apparently started going wrong, to replay it so that we can be inspired by the message that doom is not inevitable and hope can alter courses. <br/><br/>No, the only thing worth seeing for me is what new contraptions these Hollywood teams devise each time to propel the camera. It gets a bit tiresome having to throw out heaps of story to focus on cinematic flows which become merely mechanic without it (story), meaningless, such is the case here.<br/><br/>In X-Men, each character is an opportunity to ripple in an unusual way. Someone will erupt in flames or change shapes, okay. The two arch rivals can leverage the most awesome forces. For the bad guy this is confined to matter, the ability to command the material fabric, to undo and rearrange - usually this is an opportunity for awesome scenery, last time a submarine was lifted out of the sea, here a whole stadium is airborne. It's daft destruction, rather suitably as will without empathy.<br/><br/>More interesting is the good professor who can enter mind, command vision. This should be the most tantalizing opportunity for scenery of another kind, which also chimes with a recurrent interest of mine; how can we envision a mental space? A girl with similar mental powers propels the journey back in time, through her we have the first glimpse of this, the camera enters inside an eye to swim in a gaseous space of consciousness. Near the end, the professor searches in a similar constellation of minds.<br/><br/>And however much they manage to perfect the material physics, there's a nifty scene where time is slowed that almost exists in the story as comedic demo-reel of what can be achieved with all the big studio tools at hand, so much more crude seems the inner dimension."

If you watch it through, you'll know what I mean. On the other hand it's nice to put a lid on some things ... or quite a couple of things. Or closing a circle ... or whatever you want to call it.<br/><br/>So whatever your take on that is (head shaking or nod of approval), will decide how you'll receive this movie. Technically there is nothing to criticize and the story (if not depicted and torn apart for logical errors), is more than entertaining enough to hold you to the edge of your seat. If you've seen the other movies, you'll love how this comes together, even if your favorite character might not get as much screen time as you thought/hoped he/she would get. Great moments and superhero movies have arrived a long time ago. And they'll continue, one way or the other. Rejoice or be afraid ;o)"

","Wouldn't it be best to change the team name to X-Humans?<br/><br/>I'm kidding, of course.<br/><br/>Want to know what isn't hysterical?<br/><br/>A 'loose canon.'<br/><br/>The exact origin of the nautical phrase is uncertain. It's presumably sailor jargon for a canon breaking free of the rigging keeping it stationary. Imagine one hundred pounds of cast iron rolling about a storm beaten ship deck.<br/><br/>The phrase is overused. But one can understand this reviewer's hesitation, when associating the live-action depiction of Wolverine with a loose canon.<br/><br/>Ever since Cyclops's cinematic demise, the clawed crusader's gone a little soft.<br/><br/>Jackman's Wolverine is much less of an antihero. He's more compassionate, no longer a recluse. And wouldn't you know it – he stars in this film, too.<br/><br/>Despite the saccharine portrayal, I'll take plenty more sequels with Hugh at the helm, because Days of Future Past is excellent.<br/><br/>What sets the X-Men apart from other comic creations is time travel, success through crafty teamwork and mutant segregation. This movie tackles the entire thematic trio with vigor.<br/><br/>First some notes on the acting, directing and writing. Then the fighting. And finally, a gloriously thought-provoking takeaway.<br/><br/>Before any of that, a warning to spoiler-sensitive readers. Cease your literary digestion and devour DOFP before it vacates the big screen.<br/><br/>James Marsden is excellent as Cyclops in X-Men (2000), and fourteen years later proves he's still got it.<br/><br/>By the by, after all this talk of 'getting the gang back together,' it's a bit underwhelming with only one scene featuring Cyclops, Rogue or Jean Grey.<br/><br/>All's forgiven, because DOFP's greatest achievement is the creation of a 'narrative reset.' The denouement (the falling action after the climax) indicates the button's been depressed, removing any narrative restrictions set by the previous films.<br/><br/>For hints toward each player's prominence, check the theatrical poster. The relative size of the character's image to screen time ratio looks exactly to scale.<br/><br/>Ellen Page returns for a particularly great performance as Kitty Pryde. Her only previous appearance is from The Last Stand back in 2006, making her unique amongst the supporting players.<br/><br/>Another reliable favorite from the earlier films, Shawn Ashmore, delivers as Iceman. He's easy to love and fights quite a bit, too.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role as Mystique and doesn't disappoint. The blue beauty engages in some serious hand-to-hand combat, and it's consistently thrilling.<br/><br/>There's a nod to Rebecca Romijn in the movie, as well as a reference I can't quite figure out. In Shanghai Noon, Owen Wilson quotes James Brown in saying, ""I don't know karate, but I do know ka-razy.""<br/><br/>So when Wolverine says it, I assume it's a nod to Shanghai Noon. Perhaps others disagree?<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender plays young Magneto, and delivers a fitting performance as one of our best actors working today.<br/><br/>A major personal criticism of earlier X-Men films is the underwhelming action. There are always fight scenes, but oftentimes they're brief and never elaborate enough. For example, consider the action involving Banshee in First Class, the most recent film from 2011.<br/><br/>To be clearer, consider the two major fights involving Beast. In First Class, Nicholas Hoult doesn't throw a single punch on-screen during the final brawl on the Cuban beach. Whether or not Hoult lands a blow, his battlefield presence pales in comparison to Kelsey Grammar's ferocity at Alcatraz in The Last Stand.<br/><br/>DOFP opens with a spectacular fight sequence. Really, it's one of the best superhero battles ever. But it's brief, and trumps all other physical conflicts (in terms of quality) occurring later on.<br/><br/>The sentinels are superbly rendered, and the teamwork dynamic is explored throughout various altercations between mutants and robots. Sending Colossus falling through warp holes (in order to achieve maximum velocity) is genius.<br/><br/>My sole request from the X-Men franchise remains the same: A further exploration of collaborative battle tactics. Engage the audience with tenser and more intricate 'continuous action' sequences that last for minutes, rather than seconds.<br/><br/>Good examples of what I refer to are found in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (but without the teamwork dynamic.)<br/><br/>What's absent is ultimately inconsequential. I want a final fight scene, one in which the X-Men collaborate to triumph over the ultimate villain. One in which they don't all die.<br/><br/>In retrospect, I'm pleased with the filmmakers' decision. Everybody loves a superhero movie that doesn't fit the mold.<br/><br/>Besides, I'll trade anything for the narrative reset.<br/><br/>When Magneto informs Charles (James McAvoy) of a misunderstanding (pertaining to J.F.K.'s assassination) a hearty stroke of laughter pierces the canopy of suspended disbelief.<br/><br/>Apparently a fellow moviegoer buys into the whole story leading up, but JFK being assassinated for his mutation is just too silly to remain silent.<br/><br/>That, my friends, is a person looking for a place to laugh.<br/><br/>'Because everybody's thinking it, right?'<br/><br/>No, you scoundrel!<br/><br/>Moving right along; Beast's serum is tough to swallow, but other than the lackluster fighting and Professor X's whining, here's my final criticism.<br/><br/>Magneto's mutation allows him to manipulate metal. This doesn't include an ability to remotely control or reprogram computerized machinery. Therefore, the process by which he gains their support would be much more complicated than simply imbuing the sentinels with metallic cables.<br/><br/>That's a major inconsistency, and like the serum, I'm sure it's necessary to tie up loose narrative threads. For my tastes, it's not quite tidy enough.<br/><br/>By the way, superhero movies are constantly berated for being male-oriented entertainment.<br/><br/>In DOFP there is one scene involving nudity, and it's Wolverine from behind.<br/><br/>I'm not complaining.<br/><br/>When the political correctors start to cry out for a more 'accepting' team moniker, I'll remind them of this previous gender imbalance.<br/><br/>How's that for conclusive?<br/><br/>Breathtaking, isn't it?"
"CassiusHayes","9","2","5","28 June 2014"," Surpasses Every Other Film!
","The previous films have all been lacking something, maybe with the exception of X2, but Days of Future Past renews the series in a great way. The acting in the film knocks the ball out of the park, by bringing the new mutants together with the old mutants to create great chemistry between most of the cast. Every actor has a time to shine, even if it may be for 2-3 minutes, but they all make an impact on the film. Hugh Jackman, probably makes the best out of Wolverine,by bringing out his inner animal within the film, unlike most of the other X-Men films.<br/><br/>The action is also much better handled in the film than the others as well, like the fights between the Sentinels and Past Magneto. The CGI effects are great, but the only downside in the film are the potholes, which are usually fixed in many ways though. Definitely see this film if you are looking for a fun, action packed film. It's probably the best way to start of the summer film season in my own opinion."

It was outstanding, original and probably the most emotional one yet as we truly see a dark side of the mutants suffering with the human race and quite frankly getting fed up with their existence. What captured my attention ever since I knew this film was going to be made, was the fact that actors from X-Men: First Class and the original 00's X-Men movies were all working together, which was exciting stuff! I'm a massive fan of time-travel and the fact that the old and the new actors were in the same film (in the past and future) was majestic. I will say though is that you have to watch the previous movies before watching this one. If you're watching this with a fresh mind, then the story is not going to be clear for you (good thing that I'm a X-Men fan!) cause there's a load of references that link the previous movies to this current one, especially the very first X-Men films.<br/><br/>But once you've done your homework, analysing and understanding what's happening in the X-Men world, then you'll truly appreciate this movie.

"DragoonKain","10","2","5","5 June 2014"," The X-Men movie franchise is still alive, and better than ever
","It's very rare that you get to see a film franchise make it to its seventh installment and still have the ability to impress fans and critics alike. But never before has a film franchise made it to its seventh installment and actually topped all of its previous efforts.<br/><br/>However, when I say seventh installment, I suppose I should include an asterisk. First this includes the two Wolverine films, the second of which didn't even have X-Men in the title. And secondly, The X-Men movie series, like the comics, is a bit of a convoluted mess, and it's sometimes difficult to figure which films are part of the ""official canon"" and which aren't. The comics have the excuse of being around for over 50 years with dozens of spin-offs and thousands of comics/graphic novels between them. That's a lot of story continuity, so it's understandable that things will become convoluted after awhile.<br/><br/>The movies don't have that excuse, and the cracks in continuity began to show as early as the fourth film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Indeed, some would argue that the previous film, X-Men: The Last Stand, was the beginning of the end. Those two films, though entertaining, were definitely a dark period for the X-Men films, and many of us were beginning to think the franchise would end with the disappointing fourth installment.<br/><br/>But if Fox failed to make another X-Men movie in a timely manner, they would lose the rights to the franchise and Marvel Studios would take the reigns. For awhile I was hoping this would happen. X-Men would then be able to exist in the same universe as the Avengers, a team that has close ties with X-Men in the comics, and has shared more than a few members (one of whom, Quicksilver, actually does appear in both this X-Men movie and the upcoming Avengers film).<br/><br/>But then fox released X-Men: First Class. At first I thought it was a reboot since it seemed to ignore most of the continuity of the last four films. But no, it turns out it was a prequel, and a fantastic one at that. It's very rare that prequels turn out to be better than the originals they are meant to precede, but First Class managed to do this, and it even managed to do it without the star character, Wolverine, who only made a brief cameo appearance.<br/><br/>It seemed that the writers had learned that the key to a good X- Men movie wasn't Wolverine, it wasn't the action or even the mutant powers. It's the deeper competing philosophies that X-Men puts forward as exhibited by the two most important characters: Professor X and Magneto. The originals had these two amazing characters portrayed by Shakespearean stage play veterans Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. But it was fascinating seeing their younger selves as portrayed by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Both pairs nailed their respective parts to perfection.<br/><br/>This film, using one of my favorite science fiction plot devices: time travel, manages to bring both pairs together in the same film to brilliant effect. It's wonderful seeing the older and wiser Prof X and Magneto contrasted with their younger, more passionate selves. Peter Dinklage, playing the fanatical Bolivar Trask, manages to paint a sympathetic picture of the villain. If one thing X-Men does right, it's in its portrayals of villains. Very few of them are actually ""comic book evil"". They're just people, usually with deep convictions, who believe they are doing the right thing. The deeper themes of fanaticism, the horrors of war and genocide and how the road to hell is paved with good intentions is brilliantly adapted from the source material.<br/><br/>I remember reading the ""Days of Future Passed"" comic book double issue as a teenager and it had a deep impression on me. Many people have accused this film of ripping off The Terminator, but what they probably don't realize is that the original story-line was written in 1981 by Chris Claremont. If anything, The Terminator ripped off Days of Future Passed.<br/><br/>That being said, aside from the premise, this film is quite different from the original 1981 comic book story arc. But those changes were necessary since the movie franchise exists in a very different universe than the comic book franchise. Still, major themes and the heart of the story is preserved, and that's really all that matters.<br/><br/>So did this movie ""fix"" the plot-holes and continuity issues of the previous six installments? Well, it's hard to say. Once you introduce multiple time-lines into the equation, I guess any plot-hole or inconsistency can be explained away simply by saying ""this movie exists on a different time-line where things happened differently"". It doesn't exactly explain why Professor X is suddenly alive again at the beginning of this film, but I guess it doesn't require an explanation either. It's not perfect, but I try not to let it bother me. At the end of the day the film stands on its own as an excellent bit of cinema. If you're looking for plot-holes, you're going to find them. But fortunately, the movie is so good that you forget to look for them."
"tinovalkki","9","2","5","3 June 2014"," Best mutant movie so far
","X-Men: Days of Future Past is definitely best mutant movie so far. Story plays nicely with time travel story which makes it more interesting. Movie is irresistible stylish, charismatic and most of all sincere enjoyable super hero thriller what you can compare to Christopher Nolan's stylish Batman movies. Previous Wolverine movie was a little disappointment, but this one is almost as good as first two X-men movies. You can almost say that this movie combines all the best parts from first two movies to one excellent story. But not so good that there is something bad too. Once again 3D feels vain. If you don't trust your camera man enough to let him bring something more artistic for shooting, then the result feels only lame stereophonic view. A bit like your childhood view master experience. After all movie is a great summer fun movie and very enjoyable to all X-men fans.<br/><br/>http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/"

","I really enjoyed watching the movie. It had it all, if you ask me. I mean; seriously, it was emotional, exciting and the visual effects were amazing. <br/><br/>I was expecting a lot from this movie because I used to watch X-men cartoons and the Days of Future Past episodes were the best ones and the cast is amazing and we all know what Bryan Singer is capable to do.<br/><br/>The Quicksilver character was surprisingly successful. And I have really no words for James McAvoy and Jennifer Lawrence, I just hope to see them more in good movies like this.<br/><br/>It is the second best movie based on a comic(Dark Knight is first) and the best X-Men movie.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"tavm","9","2","5","28 May 2014"," X-Men: Days of Future Past was another awesome entry in the series
","Well, Bryan Singer outdid himself again in his third outing as the director of an X-Men film! Quite an awesome mix of the younger/older versions of Professor X and Magneto with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine being the connection between them as he gets sent by them to the '70s to prevent a war involving the giant robots called the Sentinels. Also involved are the '70s version of The Beast and Quicksilver. Oh, yes, there's also Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique. So not only is there awesome action but also pertinent dialogue in advancing the story and characterization which was based on Chris Claremont's writing when he plotted the comic series during the '70s/'80s. So on that note, I highly recommend X-Men: Days of Future Past."

","I'm going to keep this brief. Saw this film last night and it kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole 2 hours and eleven minutes. Superb action mixed with great story telling.<br/><br/>Recommend 100% if you like any sort of comic book film - this wipes the floor with the other X- men films. <br/><br/>Suitable for families and adults, keeps you engaged throughout. There's no point me mentioning any part of the storyline, so just watch it. <br/><br/>oh and Jennifer Lawrence is gorgeous in this, as usual. <br/><br/>See you.<br/><br/>Peace."

","I think they finally found the right director for this series. X-men First class was probably the first X-men movie that I felt was done right for the first time. I've been a comic book fan for 25 years, and I have to say, this movie and X-men first class are now the standard to what a good comic book movie should be, (save maybe Batman Trilogy which is amazing) This movie was action packed, and showed the dearth of emotions that one goes through while reading the comics, it really does capture the parts of what makes a comic book story so compelling, and i felt that this movie finally was able to capture what makes a comic book such a great story telling medium. The fact that this director is able to take the best of the comic book feel and put it on screen is breathtaking. I literally was smiling in the middle of this movie,cause it felt like I was watching a masterpiece of art, that finally gotit correct... X-men first class was already so impressive to me, and then they gave me this.. its a bit of a different story from the comic bookversion of Days of Future past, but it really does a fantastic job recreating the gist of it, and wrapping up all the previous movies into this one. and basically restarting the franchise correctly. <br/><br/>All Hail Bryan Singer and his crew for bringing us comic fans this masterpiece. Please keep him around for a long time as this director knows what he is doing. I'd sign a long term contract with him asap. Cannot wait for the next movie."
"seth-goodwin23","10","2","5","28 May 2014"," Bryan Singer has done it again.
","X-Men: Days of Future Past was directed by Bryan Singer and stars Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, and Michael Fassbender. Bryan Singer directed X-Men (2000) and X2 (2003) and was a writer/producer on X-Men: First Class (2011). Days of Future Past came with the original cast joined by the First Class cast.This movie is not your ordinary X-Men film. Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) must go back in time to 1973 to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from murdering Bolivar Trask. <br/><br/>This is by far my favorite X-Men film. The intro was the same style of the original trilogy opening. All you X-Men fans know what I'm talking about when I say it brings a smile to your face when you here that theme song at the intro of DOFP. We haven't heard that music since X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) eight years ago. The movie even had some humor in it.

","We saw the new Spiderman movie last weekend. It was poorly done. Consequently, we almost gave up on seeing the new X-Men movie. Thank goodness we didn't. This movie was as fast paced & packed with fights, tense situations that you're sitting there every minute hoping Magneto becomes a good guy and that Professor Xavier gets his legs back. The Good Guy vs. Bad Guy was, for once, less predictable than in previous movies. Simply put, we loved it. The only down side is there is so much CG that after a while you're just staring at certain scenes knowing they are green/blue screen and missing what was going on. Well worth the almost 20 Bucks we paid to see it. Worth seeing it on the big screen as well."
"Bruce722","7","2","5","25 May 2014"," Day of Future Past is a fantastic superhero movie in every way, shape and form... except for the gaping flaw that is its premise.
","Day of Future Past is a fantastic superhero movie in every way, shape and form... except for the gaping flaw that is its premise. Don't get me wrong, I understand that one must suspend their level of disbelief greatly in order to enjoy these films. Newsflash, I love superhero movies so clearly the suspension of disbelief isn't the issue. There is a difference between being willing to accept something as possible and there being a monumental plot hole, which was the case with this film.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** The movie is set WAY into the future where these ""robots"" called Sentinels have effectively wiped out all mutants in existence and a large portion of the human population as well. Because these Sentinels are too much for the X-Men, they conceive of a plan to send Professor X's consciousness back in time to his younger self, when the Sentinels program was in its infancy in the 1970's, so he can stop Mystique from killing the creator of the program and then being captured and experimented on, which is what results in the Sentinels being the unstoppable force they become. Because sending someone's consciousness back decades would physically tear them apart, the only man for the job is none other than Wolverine.<br/><br/>And that's the premise of the film. Did nobody else scream ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!"" when reading that? Allow me to clarify once again. I am willing to accept that there are invincible robots, that mutants exist, and that you can send someone's consciousness back in time decades for an extended period of time. I have no problem with any of those concepts because I have suspended my disbelief completely. However, if you know who creates this horrible program and you can send someone back in time, wouldn't you just send Logan a little further back and kill the creator, effectively eliminating the threat of the Sentinels before they ever exist?<br/><br/>There are other plot holes throughout the film but I'd categorize those as relatively minor, akin to the ones you will typically find, not just in superhero movies but in films in general, so I won't go into detail on those. I'll simply say that a 9 or 10 caliber superhero movie with incredible acting, especially from James McAvoy, great special effects, and awesome action scenes easily drops to a 6 or 7 caliber movie because every single dramatic element was clouded with an ""If they did this obvious thing, none of this crap would've happened"". (6 + 7)/2 = 6.5, which rounds to 7. That's about the best explanation possible for my reasoning."

I don't even know where to begin but simply I must commend Brian Singer for his maturity and growth in developing a powerful, cohesive and compelling movie for the ages. I have to say this was the best superhero movie I've seen so far and actually the most memorable movie I've seen in recent years. I want to share so much but don't want to spill spoilers onto this review. It's just really good from start to finish. But that ending was so powerful and engaging. I just love the extreme Brian Singer went to make the audience engage very deeply with the mutants especially in the way they faced an immovable enemy - the sentinels. As an audience, I was so deeply engaged with the mutants that there actually was a sigh of relief when there future was altered for good. It's more than just a good guys vs bad but the hinge of the movie came at realizing the climax of the power of choice and wondering what each individual would do with that choice but especially for the two well-known villains - Mystique and Magneto. Striking movie and a stellar performance from every character. That kitchen scene was just superb. Made the entire theater laugh out loud. Bravo."
"raj040492","7","2","5","22 May 2014"," (hey) days of an all star cast
","In the trail of ""X-Men: First Class"", this is also a period movie of superheroes taking on their differences with humanity and finding the right path in due process except that this is mashed up with the clichÃ© of science fiction, Time Travel.<br/><br/>Logan is sent back in time to change a particular event in history that will forever alter the course of history for worse (I mean big time worse). In order to do that he must confront Professor-X at the worst stage of his life and convince him of the time travel theory and bring the best out of him.<br/><br/>The lump some of the story is revealed through the trailers and teasers which makes the story monotonous. So, there are no surprises in that area. The lack of any sort of twist adds woe to the story department. The complexity of weaving the future and past together is managed well by the screenplay team.<br/><br/>If First class changed the Cuban Missile crisis history, this movie has altered the JFK assassination and if that surprises you, then wait until Magneto explains the truth behind it.<br/><br/>An eerie bit of seriousness prevails throughout the movie. This was a trademark of X-men movies but ""First Stand"" tried to add fun into the potion. It looks like we are back to default. But occasionally we do have a few one-liners but nothing on par with the other Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>The cast have filled in the suits and done what was asked for. Nothing superlative but nothing worse either. Blink, Quicksilver are valuable additions to the line-up with their powers brilliantly lit up on the screen, thanks to CG team. The prison break sequence is a standout example.<br/><br/>A meaty role is bestowed upon Mystique. Whether J-Law's fame added to the character's weight or vice versa is something that only the director can answer. Word on the street was Bryan Singer had long discussions with James Cameron to make the concept of time travel more relatable to the audience. It seems that the discussions have paid off.<br/><br/>Magneto's stunt with the submarine and the missiles was what I considered as ultimate. The teasers made me rethink (baseball stadium). But the execution of it could have been more majestic i.e. there is very little frame of the stadium being held on air.<br/><br/>Another significant addition to be noted is Peter Dinklage as the mutant-hating scientist. He is good as always with the 70's look adding more gravity to his role.<br/><br/>My final word: Entertaining but slightly (very slightly) disappointed. Stay until THE end for a post credit scene.

"patreqholmz","Null","3","11","23 May 2014"," Days of future past can't pass fast enough!
","X-Men Days of Future Past is yet another failed adaptation of one of the most successful comic book franchises of all time. Those of us who grew up with X-Men have come to love the characters and their back stories. The most beloved mutants, Storm, Kitty Pryde, and Rogue, who have been a constant from the beginning have had much of their character and presence stripped away and replaced with male characters such as Magneto, Beast, and Wolverine who have dominated the big screen script. A lot of focus was placed on Mystique as well. Their sleek comic book costumes have been replaced by black militant riot gear, which looks a lot like Batman's rubber suit. X-Men 1-2 and 3 story lines centered around Wolverine, and the male characters. It appears to me that the writers and the directors are intimidated by strong powerful woman, and I'm left with the impression that they didn't even research the mutants individual back stories. The most disappointing scenes is when Storm, Cyclops, and Gene Gray, where all being tossed around by Toad...really? Based on the comic book character, Storm is a strong willed leader who commands the group and takes down the difficult villains. However, on the big screen she's portrayed as a timid mutant who take orders from Wolverine, and poor Rogue was slowly erased completely. The writers and directors missed a great opportunity to explore the full potential of the most powerful and diverse mutants of the X-Men franchise. I would like to have seen more impending doom with a lot more of power display and fight scenes from Storm, and Rogue, and a lot less of Wolverine saving the day. I do not like any of the existing X-Men movies. My wish is that I live long enough to see X-Men rebooted about 10 years from now with directors and writers who appreciate the original vision of X-Men without dumbing down any of the characters."

You will watch two stories running in two parallel universes: one in the year 1973 and the other is 50 years advance. ""Hugh Jackman"" or ""Logan"" is the only actor that exist in both stories and all the other characters are represented by two different actors. I can say both actors for the same character are outstanding ""James McAvoy"" and ""Patrick Stewart"", ""Michael Fassbender"" and ""Ian McKellen"" are the awesome faces of the past and the future. The most important and good thing about the movie is that some old characters in the X-men series were brought back to life again at the end of the movie which open new stories and adventures to the writers.

"classicsoncall","9","2","6","25 May 2014"," ""My war is not over. The enemy's still out there.""
","By now, it doesn't surprise me any more when a film like this breaks into IMDb's Top 100 films (#65 as I write this) after only a couple days of release. No point in dwelling on that, but I mention it for some perspective; here's a comic book movie in the same elite company as ""The Godfather"", ""Schindler's List"" and ""Casablanca"". Go figure.<br/><br/>So with a time travel theme as the main plot element here, it would seem like some aspects of the story would be confusing but I followed it along pretty well. But help me out here. When Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) did the Jedi mind trick to gain access to the White House speech, was that a rip-off? Or since it was 1973, would you say that this was four years before ""Star Wars"" came out and a totally original idea? See, these time travel stories can be confusing after all.<br/><br/>Now it might seem like I'm ripping the movie unfairly here, but that's not my intent. I actually had a blast with the picture, even if I'm not specifically a Marvel Comics fan. I've seen all the other X-Men titles, though not chronologically, and I think this one stacks up with ""X-Men:First Class"" at the top of the heap. It had decent character development and excellent effects, and the 'Time in a Bottle' sequence with Quicksilver (Evan Peters) was probably the stand out scene, offering a nod to yet another sci-fi thriller in ""The Matrix"". It's too bad you can't do a re-wind when you're in the theater, I would have played that one a few more times.<br/><br/>Where this all goes from here is anybody's guess. I think the X-Men franchise is ripe for further picking, and this time they made you wait until the very end of the credits roll to give a hint of what's to come. I really didn't recognize the female character in the Darth Maul get-up, but my very fuzzy memory of the comics calls to mind a story line dealing with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. On the flip side, I could be totally off base on this altogether.<br/><br/>In a separate but related note, one of the trailers screened before this movie in my theater looked like a real hoot and a half coming out in August. It looked like Marvel's take on the Star Wars universe (there it is again), with a rousing score for Guardians of the Galaxy. Looks like fun."

","I kinda knew I would probably enjoy this movie going into it, and my expectations were exceeded. This is an enjoyable take on the X franchise, it stands on it's own while taking baby steps into paying homage to the source material (let's be honest, while those original stories were iconic, the writing wasn't always great.). All actors provide performances with emotional resonance without being too heavy or overbearing. There is a nice balance of humor and drama. Even the original cast (who I have never been much of a fan of, aside from ellen page) provide a great action based counter point to the more character driven 70's characters. While there are a whole bunch of characters in this movie, the writers knew who to focus on and who to give a small amount of screen time (though more havock and rouge would have been awesome.). You really get a sense that singer and the writing team put time and effort into allowing the actors to play to their strengths in the right places. Mackavoy and Fassbender kill it in this movie. Hugh jackman is very enjoyable and inhabits the role way better than he did ten years ago. Jennifer Lawrence is very good here, and performs way better than she does in those crappy hunger games movies. Quicksilver is the most surprising highlight of this film, and kinda steals the show. Overall I think this is one of the best comic based movies ever made (sorry X2 sucks) and they didn't need to create too much collateral damage to get it done (hey magneto is very careful with that stadium ;p )"

","The trailer really leaved me with high expectations about the movie but after watching it, it was OK but I wasn't really that satisfied with it as expected<br/><br/>Once again, this really felt more like a Wolverine movie than an X-Men movie because time and time again they focus too much of him and its getting really boring for me. Fine, many people say that X-Men is all about Wolverine and that maybe true but still, the other characters still deserve their fair share of screen time as well <br/><br/>Well, to get to the movie, its an interesting story. Preventing the war in the future from happening. In a way, it reminds me of Back To The Future movies. The actors did well for their respective roles. Hugh Jackman shows why he deserves to be in the role as Wolverine. He shows all the is to the character and it will be tough to a replacement for him once he decides to let go of the character. Nicholas Hoult does well as Beast. Michael Fassbender also demonstrates why he is the ruthless Magneto but for me, the best character of the film goes to James McAvoy's Charles Xavier. He played played the role really well and was definitely the savior of humanity. The other mutants from the future didn't really do much in the movie apart from appearing there from going up against the sentinals as expected. This movie for might have some issues for younger children especially situations when Mystique appears but other than that, nothing much to worry<br/><br/>Overall, a great movie and something to the superhero different to the superhero genre but in my opinion this movie can't topple Captain America The Winter Soldier for me"

","I was so intrigued about this movie. I had a terrible feeling of disappointment because First Class was absolutely fine and riveting. That one was even better than X-Men 2 (the last one directed by Brian Singer before this). So I tried to went to see this with low expectation. And what a wonderful entertainment and surprising thoughtful story I found here. Days Of Future Past is the best X-men movie so far for two main reasons:<br/><br/>Fans of the original trilogy and First Class will definitely enjoy this one thanking its nostalgia and its perfect and well balanced mix between the original characters and the new ones (with just a few ones who maybe deserved more credit, but is not at all a problem for the movie). & This movie delivers a surprising top notch entertaining with a potent story and some good twists that help to live up expectations mixed with terrific special effects and cinematography. 3-D is very cool here.<br/><br/>The actors are fantastic. Fassbender and McAvoy still delivering amazing performances meanwhile Stewart and Mckellen give their reflections in the same excellent way that in the trilogy. Hugh Jackman finally finds his character as a true important one in comparison with the last movies. Wolverine/Logan finally has a proper treatment in this movie that will help anyone who could be annoyed with his solo adventures to love him again. They are the five main stars of the story with the inclusion of a spectacular and skillful Mystique (impressive Jennifer Lawrence who steals almost every scene of hers) who is undoubtedly the sixth one. The other actors made good performances and make possible the transitions of the story until the amazing finale.<br/><br/>It has been so many comparisons with The Avengers. Let me tell you something with all my respect. I found this one truly better. X-Men: Days of Future Past will please the fans and moviegoers and will inject fresh blood and joy to the franchise. This is a terrific time at the movies. Don't miss the opportunity to see it."

","While I liked Days of Future Past, in the end I felt a bit disappointed - not by the film itself, which was fine, but by the realisation that it was made as a rebooting vehicle.<br/><br/>The story is fairly easy to simplify down to ""X-Men meet Terminator"", but the action scenes are good, some are even great, the main cast is doing a good job (James McAvoy for example seemed to me to be doing a better job than at First Class), while the (shorter than we'd like) presence of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen is always superb. Peter Dinklage makes a fine villain, although his role could be bigger as well.<br/><br/>The usual problem with this sort of time travel films is, ironically, the predictability. It was a particularly easy guess that the future heroes would die, but the mission would succeed, so no harm done. Which makes the death scenes of heroes like Storm or the parting words between X and Magneto lose all of their dramatic value, and work simply as a way to say goodbye not to the characters, but to the actors. Which brings us to the second issue - this may be just a personal quirk, but I do not appreciate alternate timelines. I realise it's a very common comic-book trope, but it seriously bothers me to have a film end by telling me ""you know what, all the previous X-Men films never happened! Jean is alive, everyone is happy, hooray!"". While I understand the reasoning, both dramatically and from a marketing point of view ('we want to make films with the new actors, because these ones are old' or something) I find it dishonest, cheap, and more importantly, subversive to all the previous movies.<br/><br/>So all in all, I liked the film, but would much prefer it if it had somehow set its divergence point at some point after the Last Stand - though I will admit I don't see how they could do that AND include the new cast."

"werdnaoslek","7","1","2","22 June 2016"," My thoughts on Bryan Singer's return to the franchise
","So X-Men: Days of Future Past is about the dystopian future, where sentinel robot drones seek out and kill all mutants and X-Men. The X-Men realize there is no way to save themselves from the sentinels and their inevitable extinction if they don't send someone's conscious back in time to change the course of history, and prevent the sentinels from being initiated onto the mutants. The only one strong enough to go back in time is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and it's up to him to unite Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) in the past to prevent the grim future from happening. There is actually quite a lot of depth to this movie's plot, and I did enjoy many aspects of it. This movie exudes confidence from Bryan Singer, and I love how he can take X- Men back for himself after a couple of terrible X-Men movies from 20th Century Fox that put his work in the first two movies to shame. This movie is a sequel to one timeline of X-Men and another at the same time. The cast from X-Men First Class is the same, which is great to see. James McAvoy is really great as Professor X in this movie, and Michael Fassbender is still killing it as Magneto. These actors are more prominent in this movie, and the dystopian future is focused on less. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are given a little less screen time, which is fine by me because they still sell their role. Peter Dinklage as Trask is also the antagonist for a portion of this movie, and he is very good. He always gives a good performance, even if he isn't too picky about his roles. Like how anyone would ever agree to star in an Adam Sandler movie based off of old videogames is pretty beyond me. The performances that stood out the most to me in this movie were definitely James McAvoy, Hugh Jackman, Michael Fassbender and Evan Peters (Quicksilver). The characters all had great chemistry with each other on screen, and the majority/entirety of these actors performances was in the past. We also got to see a new side of Wolverine and young Professor X in this movie, with Wolverine being more reserved and less aggressive, and Professor X being at his lowest low, and essentially a junkie at the start of the film.<br/><br/>The best part about the characters in this movie is that you can identify with them. With the exception of Trask, the character motivations are never confusing or unclear, so that at least you can understand one of the antagonists reasoning. Although Peter Dinklage gave a good performance, there isn't that much substance to his character, and he didn't have that much of a motivation for his character. What was a really interesting concept in this movie, was that there wasn't a clear, defined antagonist. The antagonist is different for different characters and their perception of the unfolding events. This movie also had a couple of great action scenes, and some intense moments as well. There's a fantastic scene involving a lot of mutants that sets the third act into motion in Paris, where a lot of civilians witness mutant powers for the first time. The way they shot that scene with different excerpt shots that were meant to look like people filming on cameras from the 1970's really added to the terror of the humans. As for the action scenes, they were all choreographed just fine and were kept to a minimal. I would say that for this type of movie that less is more, because it made room for more creative fight scenes that I won't spoil, but went beyond just average fist-fighting. One problem I had with this movie was that although the story was unique to the universe and really interesting, there were still a couple of predictable points in the movie. The story this movie told was really good, but some character dilemmas or choices were really easy to predict, which took me out of the movie somewhat, but didn't ruin the movie for me.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of hope and emotion stretched throughout, and I like how well balanced all the characters roles and screen time is in this movie. Every person feels necessary to the movie. Bryan Singer did a great job with this movie. I liked how a part of this movie was a somewhat emotional and mental conflict, which can sometimes be hard to come by in superhero movies, where usually the conflict just lies with the antagonist. Bryan Singer did intentionally mess with the X-Men timeline, which I liked since it was basically a big middle finger to the terrible movies in the series. People who are supposed to be dead are still alive, vice versa and a couple of other changes that are kind of confusing if you don't go into the movie with the knowledge that it doesn't build off the last movie. It's a kind of jerk move to disregard another director's work in the same franchise, even if it is terrible, rather than build off of it. But I can totally forgive this movie for it since it solves all the problems that X-Men 3 and Origins: Wolverine had. I had a great time with this movie, with a couple of fun Marvel references that seem to be obligatory in any Marvel movie. I will definitely say that this is Singer's franchise, and this movie just proves it.<br/><br/>+ Fleshed out characters - Trask's character pretty bare and dry cut + Compelling story - Somewhat predictable at points + Great Acting + Confident directing courtesy of Bryan Singer 6.6/10"

","Welcome to Wolverine 6: Days Of Future Past!<br/><br/>At this point I'm starting to get real bored with Hugh Jackman/Wolverine. Wasn't this why Wolverine got his own movies, so he could be the lead in them? The X-Men comics were published just over 50 years ago; there is a rich catalogue of characters, so let's focus on some of them, yeah?<br/><br/>Having said that, it was really amazing that they managed to get a lot of the core actors from both X-Men movie series' back together, making this a pretty epic cast!<br/><br/>The first two X-Men films are awesome, the third one made me want to cry with how horrible it was, the Wolverine films are okay but First Class and now DOFP have reinstalled my faith in Fox and the X-Men universe.<br/><br/>I'm pretty disappointed Rogue's storyline was cut from the film, I'm pretty sure I could have found some scenes to cut that weren't necessary and I think it sucks that they couldn't give the filmmakers some extra time considering these films are pretty much moneymakers for the studios so what are 15 or so minutes more?<br/><br/>I think it translated very well from the comics to the cartoon to the movie, obviously things are different in transitioning it to the big screen but it still makes for a good movie. Makes me excited for the next X-Men film.<br/><br/>A very good movie, worth a watch if you are a fan of the comics, cartoons or the other X-Men movies.

"rolando19552001","9","1","2","12 May 2016"," X Men Days of Future Past
","X Men Days of Future Past<br/><br/>The latest X Men film is all about the struggle between Charles Xavier and Erick Leshner to try and change the mind and consequently the action of Raven or Mystique. This struggle is all about who can get to her first. But of course, Magneto has a different and autonomous agenda of his own, he sees the elimination of the threat right away, not caring about the past or relationships, this is a Machiavellian man. The future is hell for the mutants, it is a genocide. The Sentinels are super powerful, super adaptable and can change to any opponent, so it is impossible to defeat this new enemy, impossible fighting like these rules. But sometimes you can bend the rules, and they are bend indeed. Kitty played by the pretty and comely Ellen Page, she has multiple powers she can get through things, and she can get through time as well. So Charles or Professor X wants to go into the past, but he cannot because the travel would destroy him. So Wolverine, Logan is the chosen one as he can recover, even his mind, mind you, he can do anything. Hugh Jackman is one of the greatest stars right now, he carries great chunks of the films. Peter Dinklage, yes the great actor that plays the conniving Tyrion Lannister in HBO hit series Game of Thrones, he can act. He plays Bolivar Trask, that is a great name. He is a doctor that admires mutants for what they can do, but he wants to kill them because he sees them as a great menace, a possible extinction. That is the great event or action of the film, because the murder of Trask by Raven, or now Mystique, played well by a very good actress, Jennifer Lawrence detonates everything. If Mystique kills Trask, she will be captured and she will be used for the next and futuristic phase of the Sentinel Program. There is a problem with that as Mystique appeared in the first trilogy of X Men movies, so that is a loose end, a minor problem because the films is great, I love this film, wow. That is the quandary of the film, will Mystique kill Trask and destroy herself and her race or will Charles help stop Raven and save the mutants? The effects are good, they have some good set pieces. The Sentinels appeared both in the future and the past. James McAvoy, one of with my favorites actors along with my favorite actor Michael Fassbender, both are great like always, they have that chemistry in leads and this bromance is something, hate, love, friendship, all is there. Days of Future Past has a very deep emotional resonance, I was moved when Charles played by McAvoy is destroyed by everything and he then through Logan sees the future. Before seeing himself, he sees Logan mind and soul, sees all the suffering he has been through, all the pain, his transformation to adamantium and then the loss of Jean, and how he kill her himself. Charles looks sad and distraught and says, ""You poor, you poor man."" I was like impressive, this was well made. Then the conversation with young Charles and old Charles is moving, you can change the future, you have to hope again. Then Magneto always with his special agenda proceed with his dream of defeating the humans, also Nixon is in play. The climax happens and everything is resolved, but I was thinking hard when Magneto make his speech to all to hear, he says that he and his mutants are the future and began almost a diatribe against humans, and with that speech there are images in the screen that shows in the future, how the sentinels are destroying the mutants. How Magneto is so blind to not understand that? I was like this is genius, Bryan Singer is a good director, I do not know what will happen, or will direct X Men Apocalypse after his allegations, but this film was great. Indeed, this is the best comic book film I have seen since The Dark Knight, is that good. I give it five stars. X Men Days of Future Past is awesome, great film, it has it all. Multiple viewings are very mandatory indeed."
"peterhill-84900","10","1","2","6 May 2016"," My favorite comic book movie of all time
","X-Men Days of Future Past unites the old and the new members of my most beloved Marvel superhero team in a spectacle movie that I cannot stop thinking about. Time travel movies are difficult to pull off and yet somehow Bryan Singer pulls it off with little difficulty. There's so many characters here (all played brilliantly) that it may have been chocked full and they would have been crammed in; but they're not! Each X-Man from the past and the present have their time to shine and whilst not all have equal screen time, their moment's are still equally as impressive. The entire film is inspiring; Magneto sending a football field up through the air, the Quicksilver sequence, the Sentinel attacks etc."
"Ziya90","6","1","2","9 April 2016"," It is not quite smart, sophisticated or even epic as the hype, just a piece of entertainment and technically well made sequel
","""Days of Future Past is not your brainless blockbuster film, it is moving, entertaining and classy, but the main focus of the story, time travel adventure is not intriguing or that sophisticated or mind blowing. It was plain and simple working as a plot device, so this X- Men movie is not ""The Butterfly Effect"" or ""Donnie Darko"" of X-Men movies. By the way, in social media, this film is compared to ""The Usual Suspects"" and it is said that ""Days of Future Past is as brilliant as that. I have to disagree. Briefly, there is an event which shouldn't happen and our team tries to stop it before happening, but there is no really a puzzle to solve. Personally, my favorite X-Men film is the first one, it has a special place in my heart. X-2 was great and the most powerful film in the series maybe. As for The Last Stand, I am terribly sorry, but I liked and enjoyed that movie very much. The third movie had the best action and the most ""close to comic book"" tone. It was not cheesy like some other super hero movies and some deaths might be frustrating for many fans, but it was realistic and dark. The second serious problem of ""Days of Future Past"" is that the future depiction in the film was pretty disappointing like a sci-fi movie made for cable TV and the designs lacked creativity. It was like I was watching Mortal Kombat 2. By the way, I would have wanted to see Storm and old Magneto more. Those characters have very short appearances. Briefly, the future scenes were poor somehow. At the beginnings, the movie has a light tone, but it gets darker after a while which is good. The characters? Well, The Beast is more intense here, Fassbender steals the show and as for Jennifer Lawrance and her Mystique, she is gorgeous, she has a charming beauty and as a character, she delivers, but I still looked for Rebecca Romijn for some reason. Toad is passive here. Sentinels are impressive, but I had problem with their size. The famous Quicksilver scene is brilliant, the best scene of the movie, but it was like a copy of Nightcrawler scene in X-2. The action in the film is neither over the top nor bad. Days of Future Past is not an action packed like the third or the first film, but the action was solid. I disagree that drama and action is perfectly balanced in the film. The stadium scene is another must see part of the film. Finally, like The First Class, the tone of the movie is more realistic rather than fantastic, by the way The First Class is a way better film than DOFP. ""Days of Future Past"" is not a masterpiece or even great, but a pretty solid film."

I enjoyed pretty much every scene with him.<br/><br/>James McAvoy totally reminded me of Rik Mayall.<br/><br/>The whole past/future plot was a big disappointment. I expected something a lot more interesting and sophisticated. It seemed like a pretty lousy excuse to mix both generations of characters."

","Second worst comic book movie of 2014, just barely beating out Amazing Spiderman 2. Another lousy Bryan Singer adaptation that turns something otherworldly and exciting into a dull forgettable mess with whiny or bland characters, not to mention Singer's typical mishandling of characters such as showing 1 minute cameos of fan boy favorite mutants(which for some reason is excessively praise as being perfectly represented and gets the majority of nerds wet in their pants) and giving ample screen time to spotlight stealer yet least interesting character Wolverine(reminding us once again this is Not the X-Men Cinematic Universe but the Wolverine Cinematic Universe).<br/><br/>Are we still stuck in the late 90s/early 2000s era of lame black leather costumes? Haven't Marvel themselves proof that heroes can have color in their outfits and not look ridiculous in live action. Even the last X-Men film proves that colorful costumes can work. OK,enough of the costumes lets focus on the plot which is just a rehash of an earlier film plot which was done a Decade Earlier. Plot:X-Men need to stop a threat by some evil humans and for some reason Magneto is there to help, but in a twist you saw coming from a mile away,good old Mags back stabs the X-Men and causes even worse crap to happen and once again Prof.X forgives Mags at the end after all the stuff he pulled because Hope Lol Hope(Yeah....keep telling yourself that,Prof.Chum). Now either this is the plot of Dofp or the plot of X men 2(alright maybe not that last bit but you get my point). In between this recycled premise, we have scenes of Prof.X being a whiny bum throughout most of his screen time, Jennifer Lawrence clearly phoning in her performance,Magneto being a 1 dimensional Mcu villain and Ellen Page constantly tearing up. I will say the effect are really good but the lighting quality is completely awful,while not nearly as bad as The Avengers, the entire flick looked almost like it was made for television.<br/><br/>Whoa,I didn't expect to write this much about this turkey but here we are. I wouldn't recommend this turd to anyone but if you're still nostalgic for that time-long era of black leather fetish superhero flicks then go for it."

","There wouldn't be so many comic book movies if it wasn't for the success of the original X-Men back in 2000. After several misguided entries, X- Men: Days of Future Past shows us there are still plenty of gas in the franchise and all thanks to the return of Director Bryan Singer.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead<br/><br/>Days of Future Past is the one of the highest grossing film in 2014 and arguably the best entry of the franchise (not bad for the 7th film of a franchise). It not only corrected many mistakes in X3 (notably the death of Cyclops and Jean Grey) and it also brought back the original casts (Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian Mckellen and Patrick Stewart which was what the First Class lacked). <br/><br/>Many argued there wasn't enough of the original cast in the future timeline when the film came out last year and I totally agreed. I personally prefer the original cast than the new generation well maybe except Michael Fassbender as Magneto. Thanks to the newly released Rogue Cut 2015, fans would not be disappointed. We are thrilled to see the return of Rogue, just because she was part of the original core team although rescuing her felt a bit too easy except Iceman had a much more painful death than the original cutÂ… She basically stole the show from Kitty Pride (after Wolverine slashed her) for the rest of the film. It felt much more appropriate and personal as she's assisting Logan this time round whereas Logan was protecting her in the first film. We can see the evolution of her character. <br/><br/>To conclude, the Rogue Cut is more or less what the original Days of Future Past should be and it is a bittersweet to say farewell to the original cast even Jackman has announced he will be hanging up his claws after his third solo in 2017. <br/><br/>Looks like X-Men Apocalypse has a big shoe to fill, I have no doubt in Singer's ability."

","There have been other lengthy reviews written on this, so I shall keep my opinion short and to the point.<br/><br/>I watched this with my 11 year old grandson and we both thought it was brilliant. Plot could be hard to follow and you would really have had to have seen most of the other X-Men movies as other posters have rightly pointed out. Also you really need to concentrate, but the time passes so quickly during the movie, the story really moves at a cracking pace but that urgency only adds to the excitement. Some terrific actors but many were not used to their full potential I thought (although this does not really impact on the film).<br/><br/>I enjoyed it being set in the 70s so had a laugh at the decor and clothes of that era, it being when I was young(er).<br/><br/>As always new characters with new abilities/powers emerged, and really top notch visuals and production values.

","Seventh ""X-Men"" film is the darkest yet, as lethal giant mutant-killing robots called Sentinels have hunted down nearly all mutants, leaving a handful of survivors including Professor Xavier(Patrick Stewart) and Magneto(Ian McKellen) who devise a desperate plan to send Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) back in time by sending his mind into his 1973 self, where he must convince the younger Xavier and Magneto to team up and stop Mystique(Jennifer Lawrence) from inadvertently causing the disaster in the first place... Though lots of skill is on display here, the use of time-travel is preposterous, not to mention disturbingly nihilistic(what's to prevent the past from being changed again, without some kind of order to stop it?) and ultimately self-defeating, trying to rectify previous films' perceived mistakes that really weren't, and only succeeding in creating a big mess itself far worse than the previous films!

"theicon87","8","1","2","12 July 2014"," 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' keeps hope alive for mutants and fans alike
","The 'X-Men' films were always second to me, right after The Dark Knight trilogy. In fact, I really thought that 'X-Men: First Class' was better than 'The Avengers'. While I'm not a fan of the Wolverine solo movies, I've liked all of the other 'X-Men' films, even the third one. It's kinda sorta a tie for me between 'First Class' and 'X2' as the best installments, but there for a while, the series hit a rocky road for fans who had plenty to complain about. With the unsteadiness of a lot of people not liking the third movie, and then to be followed by an even less liked solo Wolverine movie, moviegoers and comic fans alike began to believe that the series had peaked. Then ""First Class"" landed, and it changed things up. It rebooted the franchise in a way, by introducing a new cast of old characters, and telling the origins of Erik Lehnsherr and Charles Xavier.<br/><br/>With overwhelmingly positive reception, everyone began to see a twinkle in the eye of a thought to be exhausted consecution, and hope peaked it's head. Then came 'The Wolverine', and again, made the ground shaky for the series. It's not as terrible as it's predecessor, but it has many, many flaws. Then news came that Bryan Singer , director of the first two movies, was stepping back behind the director's chair for 'Days of Future Past'. And Matthew Vaughn, the director of ""First Class"", came on as a writer, joining up with Singer. So basically you get the best of both worlds making one movie, and it's based off of probably the best storyline in the comic series.<br/><br/>Right after the standard opening narration by Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and opening credits, the action starts immediately. With probably the most exciting opening scene I've seen all year, you see several X-Men, including Ice Man (Shawn Ashmore) fighting their biggest foes yet; Sentinels. The Sentinels are non-metal machines made up of Mystique's (Jennifer Lawrence) DNA, allowing them to adapt and use mutant's powers against them. The fight doesn't go too well for the mutants, needless to say. Using Kitty Pryde's (Ellen Page) ability, she sends Logan/Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) current consciousness into his younger self from the 1970's. So he has all his current knowledge of what the future has in store, only he's in the past, and it's his job to find a young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), and tell them what the future holds, in hopes that they'll put their differences aside.<br/><br/>Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) makes Sentinels, machines who's sole purpose is to flush out and exterminate mutants. With politicians skeptical, it isn't until a young Mystique assassinates him that the Sentinel's program is given the go-ahead. Wolverine has to bring Erik and Charles together in order to unite and find Mystique before she can murder Trask, and cause a future of ruin. Absolutely brilliant storytelling, and well-acted, as always. And like usual, regardless of how serious and dark the impending threat is, there's some good humor and one-liners that keep a fine balance, so it doesn't get too gloomy. There's a wide array of mutants/characters, and the music is really nice.<br/><br/>The action scenes are unique and mesmerizing, never failing to entertain with both visuals and violence. The last 10-15 minutes are gripping, and almost pulls at your heart. It concludes satisfyingly, and leaves you with a cliffhanger. Wait through the never-ending credits, and you'll see a glimpse of the next movie's villain, Apocalypse, who's goal is to conquer the world. He looks slender, and not how I'd picture him, but I'm sure it's going to work out just fine."

","X-Men Days of Future Past sets the tone for future X-Men movies. It was both stunning in its great special affects and great in its story line. Both done right make a great movie. What makes X-Men special is the unique characters they have. And how you can have so many people important to the story, relevant and meaningful. From the bad to the good. This constant theme of mutants and humans seems to always find a way to keep the story both unique and entertaining. <br/><br/>When you watch this film you both feel relived and excitement which is what anyone could ever ask for. From this film you feel that X-men is starting to feel like its finally on the right track. Personally i have never been the biggest X-men fan but after this film i am glad i started paying more attention to it. <br/><br/>The evenness of both action and story is what gives this movie a good tone. You have the story line which progresses over the film which grabs your attention the whole way. In this all the characters have those developments as well. Going back and fourth between every character. We feel both the importance of now and whats next.<br/><br/>The action is amazing, what gives X-men a good feel the different skills the mutants have. You see some new ones which i enjoyed. The stunning graphics is great. Its what you expect from a movie these days. The action scenes are all exciting and worth watching. A good action scene has meaning and that's exactly what this movie provides.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is deadset great, watch it whiles it still in the movies and buy it when it comes out. This has a set great feature for the next films. I enjoyed it and i am sure you will as well."

","When Bryan Singer didn't direct X-men 3 and Origins: Wolverine, it was obvious. Frankly, I don't hate them as much as most people, but the flaws are obvious. Singer shows with this movie that he is the best choice for the X-men franchise.<br/><br/>James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender do a great job filling the shoes of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as the younger version of their characters. Hugh Jackman is awesome as normal, and Jennifer Lawrence isn't bad as Mystique. Quicksilver is awesome!! The only thing I really didn't like was Wolverines bone claws, but honestly, who does.<br/><br/>Young Xavier is really down in life. One could even say he is a junkie, but McAvoy pulls it of very well, which is one of the highlights of this movie.<br/><br/>People have said they didn't like it because there wasn't enough action. To those people: the story was done so well that action wasn't needed. If you want to watch an action movie, watch Die Hard.<br/><br/>DOFP is by far, the best summer movie so far, and it will be hard to top. 10/10."

","Story Over View : Sentinels, robots that were created for the purpose of hunting down mutants were released in 1973. 50 years later the Sentinels would also hunt humans who aid mutants. Charles Xavier and his X-Men try their best to deal with the Sentinels but they are able to adapt and deal with all mutant abilities.<br/><br/>My Favor Yeah the movie is great fun with the science fiction and the technology used with the great powers of the characters and what a superb story it is. You people will enjoy a lot watch if you guys haven't watch it before . A spectacular idea about sci fiction movie involving the characters having super natural powers and unleashed powers you guys haven't imagine. I hope You guys will enjoy it."

","Days of Future Past is a good film. A good superhero film and a good X-Men film, good not great. The film is fast paced well acted and a good time, but the one thing I didn't like about the film is how it felt as thou the film was trying to tie in the other films and their messy timelines and contiunities. While X-Men 1 and 2 flowed together, X-Men 3 was a train wreck in more ways than I can count. Then there was X-Men First Class which to me is the best of the franchise. <br/><br/>And while there is a lot of fun with Days the thing that stopped it from being great was the the way Singer and company tried to wedge Days into the franchise without having to totally reboot of recon everything we have seen so far. Also having read the classic comic storyline (X-Men 142 & 143) I may have been expecting more, the storyline was there but the future world seemed to bore me t times. Making this mostly Mystique's story was a stroke of genius...while this film was a great improvement on X-3 as a follow up to First Class, I was let down, still recommend but if you haven't seen it yet wait for the DVD."

","My daughter saw this movie before I did and told me that she fell asleep, so I was hesitant to see it and didn't go the first week. Yet I was not disappointed. This movie was funny when it needed to be, and action packed at other times. It's subplot was palpable and more importantly made sense. The main plot seemed a little obvious as to it's immediate resolution in the movie but even though you knew it was coming you had several places where they could've put it so it kept me guessing. Unfortunately, the writers got a little lazy and allowed convenience to enter the movie a couple of key times. My biggest problem was that I wished they'd have done even more with the speed guy, you'll see what I mean."

","I heard that this movie was very good but did not know what to expect going in to the theater with 3 friends. Immediately, I was taken away by the film's fight sequences and special effects. The acting was outstanding and the score was perfect. The movie was intense and an edge-of-your-seat experience. The story was amazing, and the writing was up to par. There was one sequence in the film that will likely go down in history as one of the best of all time. This movie is by far the best I have seen this year and I may even go to see it again. I don't think that I can think of one mistake in this film. Every little detail in this film was worked on, and don't forget to stay until after the credits.

","X-Men is a franchise that has earned the trust of the fans to always entertain and this time too it fulfills its promise. A dark, thrilling start with coffin like spaceships shooting bodies in the air towards the land, the viewers are left aghast at the devastation left behind by these bodies which are apparently a sort of robots called the Sentinels made to destroy all mutants. The world has been left in ruins with the human as well as the mutant race on the brink of extinction. The only solution to save the humans and the mutants is to send Logan (Wolverine) back in time to the year 1973 and stop the sequence of events that led to their present situation!<br/><br/>Out of the box thinking, terrific acting, A- class star cast and exciting action sequences make this movie worth every penny spent. Jennifer Lawrence is a terrific actress and if she did a admirable job in the previous movies as mystique then just wait and watch her in this movie. She is completely awesome! A vulnerable, confused girl as Raven and a dangerous, unbalanced mutant as Mystique; she plays her role to perfection. Hugh Jackman is his usual splendid self and plays Wolverine with ease. The variations in his character are flawlessly portrayed by him and as always one is left totally thrilled watching him on the big screen. The older Professor X, Patrick Stewart; and Magneto, Ian McKellan have limited roles here but their performance is perfectly A- class. Their younger selves, McAvoy as Charles Xavier and Fassbender as Eric enchant the fans with their power pack performances. The actors playing Kitty, Beast, Iceman etc. also do justice to their parts and each is able snag the attention of the fans irrespective of the length of their part in the movie. However, worth noting here is the new entries, Peter Dinklage as Dr. Trask and Evan Peters as Quicksilver. The perfect villain who creates the Sentinels, Dr. Trask is a genius with a twisted admiration for the mutants. He has created the perfect weapon to end the mutant race. Quicksilver is quick and the scenes where he gets Magneto out of prison are totally magical and thrilling. Peter and Evan are sure to get a huge fan following after this movie. <br/><br/>The 3D portion is okay but a bit disbalanced with the major portion in the first part and almost no effects in the second part. The climax is entertaining but the sense of urgency that should have been present is lacking. The Direction and editing is admirable. The scenes flow fluidly from one event to another. Make-up, sets, special effects and photography is as usual done by expert people who make everything believable. Several story lines are opened in the movie and a base set for the upcoming movies.<br/><br/>All in all, a movie worth spending money on. Go watch it and enjoy. :)<br/><br/>This review is also available on my blog Njkinny's World of Books & Stuff"

In this movie the magneto runs then what will happen in the future. Next parts will be gonna interesting. The effects of the x-men days of future past were good and when the wolverine goes in past there are sentinels and it looks awkward to see the technology which is not present today and there in the past there is such an advanced technology.

","X-Men: Days of Futures Past simply amazed me. Best X-Men yet and everything was perfect to me. It was a very complex but yet brilliant script. I really did love everything about it. If you have vigorously watched and appreciated all the X-Men (like me) then you will truly appreciate this movie more than any other ordinary super-hero movie goer. There are some questions that are left unanswered and I am not sure if I missed something or if it's because they are trying to lead you onto the next movie in the franchise. But whatever it is I can't wait for the next one. This was beautifully put together and is without question the best X-Men yet. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and just when it scoots you back in your chair it then slingshots you back to the edge of your seat. This definitely has competition with films like Godzilla, Amazing Spider-Man 2, and Edge Of Tomorrow to determine the best movie of the summer. I would go see this if you are a super-hero fan... If you don't appreciate super-hero's.... then first of all... you don't have a life, and I wouldn't recommend seeing this even though it's perfect in almost every way."
"Al_The_Strange","Null","1","2","14 June 2014"," X-Men Days of Future Past Review
","It's been fourteen years since the X-Men first hit the big screen, setting the trend for a whole monsoon of comic-book movies. Counting the two stand-alone Wolverine movies, Days of Future Past is the seventh in the series. The X-Men have had so many ups and downs over the years that it's easily become the most convoluted franchise since the original Planet of the Apes. This film fulfills the same role as Escape from Planet of the Apes, redirecting the story arcs to rectify past mistakes and set the path for a bold, promising future.<br/><br/>Days of Future Past takes after First Class primarily, but there are vague connections to the other movies. Unlike the previous films, this one doesn't have the same light-spirited kick-butt feel. If anything, it starts off looking like The Terminator, swapping out T-800s for Sentinels, with Wolverine standing in for the T-101, Mystique fulfilling the role of Sarah Connor, and Trask standing in for Miles Dyson and Cyberdyne. However, it never comes off as a rip-off; it's still X-Men to the core. The bleak future we see in the film's opening has always been in the cards, representing the apex of the ongoing conflict between men and mutants; the set-up is laid out very quickly, before launching a double-barreled narrative in both the past and the future with substantial stakes and suspense.<br/><br/>In lesser hands, this could have become a hokey affair (and chances are that the most critical of viewers could nitpick plot inconsistencies, especially when time travel is involved). However, this is easily the most mature film of the series, thanks not only to the complex plot dynamics that unfold with this unique premise, but also because of the characters. Their motivations and relationships are as strong as ever, and drives the story into different directions. Charles Xavier in particular emerges as the heart and soul of the whole film, driving numerous conflicts among other characters and within himself that underscores key themes concerning progress, destiny, and overcoming adversity of any kind. A lot of the lesser characters get sidelined, but Wolverine, Mystique, Magneto, and Beast get plenty of screen time.<br/><br/>Fortunately, as the plot unfolds, it does pull out a satisfying amount of action and spectacle. It's never overblown or overwhelming, and it's not just a bunch of things blowing up just because; it's nicely-balanced action that builds logically from the story. Scenes in the future show some pretty harrowing super-powered fights, while the rest of the film dishes out a lot of cool fights (including one crazy scene entirely in slow-motion, thanks to one super-fast mutant). It all builds up to a double-whammy climax, which not only ramps up the carnage, but also draws out the suspense.<br/><br/>This film features pretty good photography. Editing is fine, although it seemed like there were a lot of scenes in the beginning where a character starts to talk, but then the camera cuts away, and it came off as a little weird, as if the movie didn't want to show you who was talking. Acting is great across the board; James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart both excel as Charles Xavier, while Michael Fassbender continues to dominate as the younger Magneto (unfortunately, I felt Ian McKellen wasn't given enough to do here). It was also great to watch Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackman, and Peter Dinklage. Writing is good, especially in the way it addresses the continuity of the series and bridges the gaps it needs to, while keeping things fresh and crafting a quality story with quality dialogue. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is alright (you can expect to hear a little bit of a reprise of the theme from the first two movies).<br/><br/>Days of Future Past is a movie about saving the future, not only in the movie, but also for the franchise as a whole. Despite certain contrivances, it is a highly nuanced story that rectifies some of the low points of the series. It genuinely kept me interested to see where it was all going. Even after the movie, it kept me interested, leaving just enough questions wide open to leave me wanting more. Best of all, the film accomplishes all this using plot and character more than special effects. So long as you've freshened up on the events of First Class, this film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"
"scottjohnson7896","9","1","2","14 June 2014"," Rewriting Wrongs (Raging Film Reviews)
","There was a lot riding on Days of Future Past after the 8 years since The Last Stand, which some people are still sour about, and a lot has changed since then. There have been spin- offs, sequels to said spin-offs, and a prequel, so now we have an anomaly; a film that is both a sequel to the prequel as well as one to the original trilogy. The question for this movie, which was also said about the The Avengers, was would this movie live up to everyone's expectations while not collapsing under the weight of its star-power? The answer is yes. But what's more is it fills in the gaps and reconnects us with characters from the past in a completely exciting and fun way.<br/><br/>I won't go into all of the story details because this movie can be rather complex to explain. Basically, in the future, the mutant hunting Sentinel's have killed off most of the mutants. The war has raged on for quite some time, thus prompting the remaining X-Men to send Wolverine back to the 1970s to stop Mystique from causing the action that prompted the Sentinel's production.<br/><br/>With a cast this large, featuring most of the original cast as well as the First Class cast, one had to wonder about who would get the most screen time. Going in I had no idea what the plot structure was going to be like. I expected it to be consistently shifting from future and past, causing some headaches along the way, but it actually spends most of its time focusing on the First Class cast, meaning James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult, Jennifer Lawrence, and the only exception, Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>The movie is just plain fun. It combines great humor and unique uses of each of the mutants powers. I was surprised at how often I caught myself laughing. Yet the move also can flip on a dime and change into something completely opposite. Young Charles and Magneto still share animosity towards each other after First Class, and it is as painful as it was then to see the two close friends hate each other. McAvoy and Fassbender both deliver excellent performances, and so does the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>For all of you Game of Thrones fans out there, Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) plays Boliver Trask, the man who creates the Sentinels, and he is great. Whether or not this is capitalizing on his fandom from Game of Thrones, he is excellent as always in whatever he does. He is definitely one of the many highlights of this film.<br/><br/>For those who have seen neither the previous movies or do not have a fresh sense of what is going on, director Bryan Singer does a good job at summing up and hinting at all that has happened. I have not seen the original trilogy for probably 8 years, but I never had a difficult time figuring out who was who and what happened to which character.<br/><br/>In the end, Days of Future Past succeeds on many levels. Not only does it live up to the expectations, it also perfectly ties up the loose ends of the original trilogy into a nice little bow, it delivers an action and humor packed movie with some great powers scenes, it features great performances, and it still leaves the door open for more movies. Days of Future Past redeems the failed Last Stand, go check it out.<br/><br/>For more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com"
"seaview1","9","1","2","11 June 2014"," X MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST and Its Bold Mission
","These are remarkable times for Marvel comic fans as film effects have enabled story and imagination to produce a visually stunning, realistic experience. With X Men: Days of Future Past, a strong team of writers and director Bryan Singer have created a highly entertaining quasi-sequel/prequel which reinvents the X Men world from all the previous versions. A logistical challenge from the get go, this film has accomplished the near impossible and approaches the excellence of The Avengers.<br/><br/>In a bleak vision of the future, mutants are being hunted down along with any human sympathizers by enhanced, robotic Sentinel hunters. With the last vestiges of hope at a remote location, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lehnsherr AKA Magneto (Ian McKellen) join forces in a last ditch effort to alter the timeline using Kitty Pryde's (Ellen Page) transferring powers to send Logan AKA Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to his body in the 1970s. His desperate mission is to convince the younger Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) to stop Raven AKA Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), from carrying out a vendetta against humans including a scientist named Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage), who holds the key to the Sentinel army. However, tracking Raven is problematic while the younger Charles has lost his purpose having withdrawn into seclusion, and a young, embittered Erik is locked away for a significant crime. How Wolverine can 'put the band back together' is just the beginning of a convoluted storyline that not only involves time travel but exposing old, emotional wounds and the fleeting hope of salvation from a doomed future.<br/><br/>From the opening 20th Century Fox fanfare with its highlighted 'X', you know Singer has got his mojo back (after the misfire of Superman Returns). Having started the current Marvel era of filmmaking with X Men (2000), he knows these characters better than anyone, and the screenplay has a strong narrative with some genuinely funny lines. Like X Men: First Class, this film crisscrosses the globe from Vietnam to Paris to Washington D.C., and much of the early period parallels actual historic events and figures as in Watchmen.<br/><br/>Fate and destiny: can history be altered and can people change? The film has such a complex plot you wonder if it will shortchange the emotional content. It doesn't. In fact, you could almost have made this a two part film and expanded the possibilities. By trying to link the old with the new into one cohesive plot was challenge enough, but by sprinkling in bits of references to the Marvel canon and providing a great ending, comic fans should be giddy and thrilled. You don't have to have seen every X Men film, but it helps to enrich the experience for fans of Marvel lore by connecting a lot of dots.<br/><br/>Once again, the interplay between the younger Charles and Erik forms the core of a paradoxical love/hate relationship. First, Charles must find his way back from his self-imposed exile amid personal loss, and then it becomes a fascinating triangle of wills; Raven may be the target, but Erik and Charles struggle for her soul. Stewart lends authority (as the older Charles) as he narrates in grim tones the opening sequence which has parallels (as in the first X Men) to the Holocaust and human intolerance.<br/><br/>The large cast shines especially McAvoy and Lawrence, who gets to speak in Vietnamese much as Fassbender espoused German in First Class. You wish there were more of Stewart and McKellen, who are so good together, and despite relegating some cast members (including Halle Berry as Storm) to brief cameos or short scenes, plenty of familiar faces reappear from previous films to lend an air of continuity, and you feel the casts of both past and present are adequately represented.<br/><br/>New characters are introduced with cool powers particularly Evan Peters as Quicksilver, whose rapid speed proves instrumental in the film's standout sequence that ranks up there with X 2's opening White House assault by Nightcrawler. The special effects are that good. Just watching the final showdown where the mutants utilize all their unique powers to do battle with the Sentinels is a treat. Mystique's special morphing powers are on full display along with her acrobatic fighting style, and Magneto's powers are dead on as he literally raises RFK Stadium when the action shifts to DC and The White House.<br/><br/>Ambitious and well executed, X Men: Days of Future Past reaches the heights of X 2 and successfully merges two different universes both past and present, resets the timelines and events in a massive reboot, and results in a cohesive, entertaining story with an expanded, marquee cast. By applying equal parts reverence and boldness with the X Men mythology, Singer and company have accomplished a nearly impossible juggling act. With visionary directors like Joss Whedon (whose The Avengers is the gold standard) and Singer, the Marvel brand is likely to be an exemplary force of film entertainment for many years to come.<br/><br/>(Yes, stay until the end of the credits for a brief, elaborate setup for the next film!)"
"dearbornvendetta","10","1","2","9 June 2014"," Oh what a sweet ride !!!
","Summer movies rarely get better than this just let me say that. The X- men series has been plagued by inconsistent changes from the comics that rarely even make it from film to film. Making any true continuity between each film very wishy washy at best. That being said I have enjoyed all of them despite sometimes taking liberties with the source material (X-Men The Last Stand). X-men The Last Stand by many hardcore comic followers is a big let down for the liberties it took and while I admit being disappointed with how they handled the Phoenix Saga I did find it overall very enjoyable. But I wont lie and say X-men Days Of Future Pasts had me very excited with its promise to go back and fix some of those liberties that were taken in The Last Stand. This is very much Xavier's story as it was in First Class, here we see a broken and unhappy Xavier who is dealing with the events of First Class. The dynamic between James McAvoy Aand Michael Fassbender is just awesome. Michael Fassbender brings so much intensity to his role as Magneto that he nearly steals every scene he's in. And of course we have probably Hugh Jackman's most human and caring portrayal of Wolverine ever seen on film. Jennifer Lawerence does a great job capturing the complexities of an angry and fed up Mystique who is very much essential to the story here. We get some amazing action scenes featuring the original cast in the future scenes and it all lends itself to the story very well. This is a dire situation that has come about and you certainly see quickly that something has to be done to fix it. Wolverine is an essential piece on the chess board in this film but it is truly Xavier who is the King. The movie fires right on every cylinder and delivers perhaps the best superhero movie since 2012's The Dark Knight Rises. We've had some great comic book movies since then but none of them were on this level. This isn't trying to be a comic book movie full of action its trying to be a story driven by comic book characters and the end result is one of the most satisfying chapters in the X-men Saga.. I can say when the movie ended the only emotion I felt was dread. Dread that I had to wait 2 more years to revisit this great characters."

"Foal24","8","1","2","3 June 2014"," See this movie. It's outstanding.
","X-Men: Days of Future Past. Can you guess what it's about from the title? You got it. It's the X-Men involved in time travelling adventures. No, it's not lame. This movie kicks butt. I could wrap this review up in one sentence by saying if you liked 'X-Men: First Class' you'll love this. I could, but then it wouldn't be the most in depth review ever.<br/><br/>Firstly, and I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality, Hugh Jackman's buttocks are sublime. That's right ladies (and men if you're so inclined), if you're a Jackman fan, rejoice! You get to see the macho, mutton-chopped mutant in all his glory in the film's opening scenes and it is impressive. The guy's body has been carved out of some form of naturally occurring rock-like substance. Most likely a rock.<br/><br/>Jackman gives his usual dependable performance as the fan favourite mutant. In his 7th outing as the gruff, tri-clawed wise-cracker he's in fine form. It's no insult, however, to say that he is well and truly outshone by some of his peers. This is quite possibly the best ensemble cast I've ever seen in a super-hero movie. And they all deliver. Jennifer Lawrence is exquisite as the blue-skinned mimic 'Mystique'. As she cavorts around the screen she provides ample depth to the character's inner conflict, and ample perve time to the superficial among us. She is definitely the hottest blue chick ever on screen (sorry Smurfette and Avatar girl).<br/><br/>Peter Dinklage, better known as Tyrion Lannister from 'Game of Thones' is, as expected, excellent. Indeed, he is becoming such an accomplished performer that his 'dwarfism' (is that politically correct?) is hardly noticed. His performances in general ensure that he is a giant on screen. His portrayal here of Doctor Bolivar Trask, the scientist responsible for creating the sentinels who will all but eradicate the mutants, is no exception.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are as solid as ever in their portrayals of Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto). Their screen time, set in the war ravaged future, is relatively small compared to that of their younger 1970's selves: James McAvoy (Xavier) and Michael Fassbender (Lehnsherr). And justifiably so, since the majority of the action takes place in the flared pant, big haired setting of 1973. As the two leaders of the younger brigade of mutants they are excellent. Fassbender, in particular, is in fine form as the tortured, metal controlling Magneto. His on-screen presence and charisma is such that he propels Magneto into rare company with the greatest ever on screen villains. Although, it can be hard identifying him as a villain, when it's so easy to relate to his motives.<br/><br/>Fans of the comics will be delighted to know that the super fast Quicksilver makes his big screen debut and just about steals the show in one memorable scene. Seriously, his 10 minutes or so is worth the price of admission alone. He is awesomeness personified.<br/><br/>The action sequences are breath-taking, as expected. I only saw it in 2- D, but I imagine it would be spectacular in 3-D. The writing is fantastic. There are several laugh out loud moments, which is rare in a super-hero movie where persecution and genocide are the central themes. I guess, if you really tried, you could find problems with the theories of time travel and the consequences of jumping back 5 decades to stop an assassination from ever occurring. I, however, chose not to watch with a copy of Stephen Hawking's 'Brief History of Time' in hand ready to disprove the films treatment of time travel. Really, you're watching a movie about mutants with super heroes, surely it's easier just to accept that this IS happening!!<br/><br/>Possibly the most pleasing aspect is that director Bryan Singer, responsible for the original X-Men and X2 movies, has managed to tie everything together nicely and undo the wrongs of Brett Ratner from X- Men 3 (The last stand). In case you've forgotten, that was something of a let down. And Rattner pretty much decided it would be a good idea to kill off half the cast. Without giving too much away, Singer sorts it out in this instalment, with what is pretty much a giant ""f#*k you"" to that butcher Rattner.<br/><br/>In summary, see this movie. It will not disappoint.<br/><br/>X-Men: Days of Future Past 8.5/10 reviewed by Matt French https://www.facebook.com/shenaniganmoviereviews"
"singularity2606","10","1","2","31 May 2014"," One of the best superhero movies made
","I absolutely loved this film. I would give it a 9.5 but can't so a 10 will do as there are only extremely minor flaws to this film most of which are personal to me The story line was great, although not sticking to the original comic story arc it still works well sending wolverine back instead of kitty pride (she was not born in 1973 as she was a teenager in x-men the last stand. The characters were well cast (new faces bishop, warpath, blink and the well played by Peter dinklage:bolivar trask) the old faces of the first trilogy were good to see and Jen law and crew from first class have shown they were good choices to play younger versions!! And not to forget evan peters playing pietro maximoff who stole every scene he was in even from Hugh jackman. To this I find my first flaw in this film maximoff/quicksilver (to which is not referenced in the film) should of had a bigger part to play considering he would of been extremely useful during the Washington scene when the sentinels and magneto we're attacking wolverine and beast. My other personal flaw of the film is the future sentinels they resembled nimrod to much with they're appearance and power set and the trailers which only showed the one future sentinel which got me excited to think that nimrod was the one hunting down the x-men, with the back up from normal sentinels. But I still like the idea of the xmen knowing they're screwed if they went up against these sentinels with hundreds of them after the remaining mutants so using kitty's newly mutated time phasing ability ( to which could of developed anytime between last stand and this for all the people bitching about how she got these new powers remember the future in this film is set in 2023 so there's 17 years between this and last stand ) they protect her while she sends bishops mind back to his body a few days to before the attack so they avoid the sentinel army (while doing this I can imagine the latter getting ripped apart by the sentinels over and over again luckily kitty hasn't failed yet Lol) So all in all despite my own personal little flaws this film is awesome definite recommend even if you ain't a fan of xmen as it's just a great film to watch but if you have little imagination or can't follow time travel story lines then there's no point because you will just think the film is stupid! I have more to say but can't really fit it all in but I will be posting a YouTube review by next week with all my points and those of my close friends as we discuss this movie in more detail as were all massive xmen fans"
"monsieurnikhil123","10","1","2","1 June 2014"," It is just like a Official reboot
","Well acted,fantastic script and best post credits scene for a marvel movie.X men days of future past had everything that a x men movie should have every character had played its part .Charles Xavier portrayed by James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart is one prominent character in the movie along with magneto portrayed by Michael Fassbender and Ian McKellen .The good thing about the movie is that the character of mystique has been taken seriously unlike other movies where mystique was shown just as a side villain .Hugh Jackman as wolverine as always did a fantastic job .Out of all the characters the character which i liked the most was quicksilver .Though i am not a big fan of this character thanks to Evan peters as quicksilver i want to see more of this character .The only problem was that his character was short although his performance was one of the highlight .By the end of the movie you feel like it had a re boot you will know it when you see it .And the end credits i say that it is the best end credit of a marvel movie .I think that it is the best sequel and the best x men movie"
"cubsckc","7","1","2","1 June 2014"," Good Story, Average Execution
","I think the movie was pretty good, however I feel that my appreciate of the film is completely different from most people's. As such, I explain why it is imperative that I give my review of the film from a bias position, simply stating the facts of what the movie was trying to portray and what it actually portrayed, as well as the minor film details. <br/><br/>Lets look at the minor details first. The effects weren't something I didn't see before, and the acting was very basic. In fact I would say the acting was very mediocre. Even though Jennifer was supposed to have a really big part with her Mystique role, she didn't really shine. As much as I missed the old X-Men, they didn't have a lot of screen time either. Surprisingly, it was Wolverine who had the most screen time and for some reason he was less rugged then he usually is. Within his over 200 years of existence he has changed a lot in the last 5. I don't think this was done well. <br/><br/>The plot of the film definitely had a ""Inception"" type feel to it. However the idea of changing the past for the future is such a tricky thing to deal with that it gets irritating when looking at the context of the universe. The fact that the past is being messed with, indicates the fact that everything else that happened in the X-Men series did not happen. It almost adds a pointless element that I could overlook. However, they incorporated so much lore in one movie that its hard to look at the rest of the X-Men films and visualize that they actually happened considering the events that are about to unfold because of Mystique. One would also question the relationship between Magneto and Mystique that we have seen throughout every X-Men series after this movie. <br/><br/>The one key thing that I had problems with is the fact that film did not specifically state how the sentinels create the future they are in when the person responsible for their creation was not able to because of the events that led up to his demise of the uncorrected past. Its the small key points that makes a big hit from a great hit. I feel this was so essential to explain the rest of the series. Especially considering we don't see the government showing any signs of dealing with the mutants in such an extreme way. It was obviously an underground group and I feel they hinted to it very vaguely like a girl that looks at you once and expects you to ask her out. <br/><br/>One another key element that should have been elaborated on is the fact that the past effecting the future had a few different types of theorems. In one hand the idea that you could change the future if you went back into the past and the other that no matter what you did the future was inevitable. We see at the end all the good guys... but no bad guys all at the School smiling and having a good time. There should have been a point settled in here because no one actually pays attention to this fact. Did they really change the future or did they prolong it? But I feel I am making the movie more interesting than what it actually did. Did you come out of the movie thinking this? Also what happened to Stryker? He is the key antagonist of the films.<br/><br/>A movie can have awesome concepts, however, its the films job to really portray them effectively enough. When I see all these ratings of 10 stars, I say to myself, ""give me a break."" It was a decent movie, but people depend on you to give an accurate and fair analysis of the film. <br/><br/>Why did people grade it really high? Well for one thing this was the closest X-Men story to directly come from the comic books. Is that really enough to give it extremely high grades? They spent millions making the move, I'd expect an extraordinary story, and I feel people came from the film thinking how finite the time travel continuum really is when the story isn't really about that at all. Only comic book nerds would understand this. Except... nobody else read them and because of the ending they actually need to spoon fed. I also think the dark X- Men look of the future X-Men was completely awesome. It is definitely a new, modern, look that will inspire our current generation to appreciate. <br/><br/>As such, though I didn't give it a harsh rating, I am actually skeptical what grade to give it. The film's entire message didn't come out as should have, even though it had an awesome plot already created for it. Many movies have really awesome concepts to them but aren't expressed. I feel like I'm back in high school where a student speaker did all his research and knows what he should say in his speech but for some reason can't get it out. I am also very sad that the real X-Men nerds when all out in the ratings, like a bunch of kids that rated a film high because they saw a nude girl. Because it's the closest thing they've wanted to see they rated it ridiculously. I also know a few friends that went to the college computers and started rating it just to boost the score. Not cool. It's troubling considering their are potential stories that could possibly not be shown in all their glory because the direction of the film and script aren't able to show the important parts."
"ayoreinf","9","1","2","1 June 2014"," Should have been a perfect 10
","I know, I'm nit-picking, I did love the film as is, I don't rate films I don't like 9. But it's the X Men, which I love so much, and this one is one of the corner stones of their comics books mythology. So the minute details that didn't really stop it from being a very enjoyable movie, still made me sorry that it's not as perfect as I wanted it to be. The acting is superb by all involved, and as I once stated the roles are the best roles ever written for comics characters. 3D roles that don't actually need the special effects to look real. The pacing is great, the CG is top notch (one can almost add obviously), and the time travel is well constructed, which is not always so easily done. So what did annoy me enough to get this film rated as mere 9. Very simply the platitudes that are getting into the story line, it's hard to explain without any spoiler added, but I'll try. People and plot directions are getting changed in a split second, because somebody says something, when something like this happens in real life it should be a real life altering moment, I remember only one such moment in the film that really qualified, all other fell short. And when a film that I believe should be a real deep story about the basic human fear of the extraordinary and the different, falls into simplistic slogans, if only at certain moments, I can't help but get annoyed. But the bottom line is still a great film for all X Men fans, and for whoever likes the sci-fi comics combo at its best."
"The-Sarkologist","8","1","2","31 May 2014"," I'm not sure where they are taking the franchise from here
","I am not really sure if they can successfully continue the X-men franchise after this movie because, in a way, it seems to tie up all of the loose strands that have come out of the other films. Also, ignoring the fact that there are still some inconsistencies with some of the other films (which I have outlined elsewhere I believe) Days of Future Past also seems to bring the two X-men Origin films into connection with the later X-men films (which has now gone substantially beyond that of a trilogy considering the second Wolverine movie is actually set after The Last Stand).<br/><br/>Days of Future Past started of very clunkyly, and somewhat annoying, because, well, I didn't particularly like the sentinels, and also it seemed as if they were trying to pack way to much into the opening sequence in the film (namely that war had broken out between the mutants and the normals, and the mutants were on the losing side). However, once they had managed to send Wolverine back in time the film itself began to pick up again.<br/><br/>The film itself has a rather strange chronology, and that is that in one sense it is set a number of years after The Last Stand, but it is also set fifteen years after First Class, which means in part it is also an Origins movie (though not quite, though the same actors that are used in Origins are used in this film as well). The catch is that Wolverine's back story seems to be incredibly blurred in a way because according to X-Men Origins: Wolverine, around this time (and the time of First Class) Wolverine was hanging around with his brother Sabretooth, however Origins and this film seem to suggest otherwise (though the ending does sort of line up with the first Wolverine movie, but I won't say too much about that).<br/><br/>Another thing about this film, which is similar to The Last Stand, was that they managed to make Magneto appear to be much, much more than a superhero and almost godlike. Okay, he has power over metal but it seems that his power is so phenomenal that he is able to lift up bridges and baseball stadiums, and in a way it sort of did nothing to suspend my disbelief. Also some of these scenes seemed to simply be done to show off the special effects and really had little to do with the plot anyway (sort of a wow factor). As for the story, well it seems as if this story is a popular one from the X-men comic, namely that the war is going badly for the mutants so they send Wolverine back into the past to attempt to prevent the war from ever beginning. Apparently there was a story arc from one of the comics, and there was also a cartoon series using the same premise (though it seemed that it was Professor X who was trapped in the future as opposed to him sending Wolverine back into the past)."
"bvswearingen","7","1","2","31 May 2014"," An Action Packed Movie
","X-Men: Days of Future Past is an action packed movie that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat! I really enjoyed this movie! I do not think it is the best film in the X-Men series, but it's not the worst either. The action in the movie is very intense! The special effects are so realistic you feel like you're actually there! Also the cast is AMAZING! You couldn't get a better group of actors for the roles. The two people that really stood out to me though was Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique! I would also like to congratulate John Ottoman on an OUTSTANDING soundtrack! The reason I gave this movie 7 stars though is because the plot was hard to follow. Also I wanted to see more of Rogue. All you do is see her in the background. I MEAN COME ON! She is one of my favorite X-Man. Overall it was a very intense action movie that I recommend for any comic book fans."
"koen_smit","9","1","2","31 May 2014"," It might as well be the best X-Men we've seen up till now.
","It looks like the X-Men movies are sort of growing up. The first three were entertaining sci-fi superhero mutant movies with a pretty good story, effects and acting. The previous (First Class, not Wolverine) stepped up a notch to tell the history of Professor X and Magneto. And now that history and the future are mixed in the latest sequel in the X-Men universe.<br/><br/>As this mostly is set in the past, we do not see a lot of the future X-men from the first three movies. Except for Wolverine, who is the one that travels back to visit the MacAvoy version of Professor X and the Fassbender version of Magneto. Both MacAvoy and Fassbender are very well cast as we could already see in First Class. Their acting skills give a lot of depth to the characters and while problems need to be solved they never let us down giving a little bit more than would be sufficient in the scene. The same counts for Jennifer Lawrence, who might as well become the Meryl Streep of her generation, as Mystique. <br/><br/>Peter Dinklage as Dr. Trask is very well cast as well. But it's not sure what happens with his character at the end. But knowing there will be another X-men in 2016 (Apocalypse) I guess we will see him return as I think he is not done yet with his war against mutants. And I guess he might find another way to still develop the sentinels.<br/><br/>If you like X-men, you're gonna love this movie. It might as well be the best X-Men we've seen up till now. I am already in full anticipation for the next installment"
"sreethered","7","1","2","31 May 2014"," The return of the prodigal son....
","X-Men is considered as one of the very first superhero-movie franchise that proved superhero movies have it's market. It also was a franchise that chopped away from it's roots right when it was flourishing at it's peak. Then came a lot of spin-offs. In the beginning, there was the visionary Bryan Singer. Then came Brett Ratner, who somewhat broken the hearts of fans worldwide. The spin-offs and directors extended into a long list including Mathew Vaughn and James Mangold. There were movies that we love, movies that we hate and movies that we tries to forget. it was inevitable that the circle should be closed so that the franchise could survive, and who might be the better person to do that other than Singer???<br/><br/>X-Men:Days Of Future Past is a movie which is prepared with so much grace and soul, so that every bit of it feels enjoyable. Not only it gives a clean chit for the franchise, it also saves the movies from being rebooted. Much of the courtesy goes for the directors Bryan Singer and Mathew Vaughn. X-Men:First Class was a unique movie that presented a strong ensemble cast and a much deviated yet successful story-telling. It was that cast and storyline helped singer to rebuild his once adorable franchise. <br/><br/>The word is at a verge of extinction, for both humans and mutants. There is only one way to stop these from happening, and is by rewriting the past. so, the X-Men sends Wolverine in to the past to fix it. The plot goes like that. It is kind of familiar since most of us are repeated viewers of Back To The Future movies. Just like Biff gets the sports almanac, something undesired happens on the past and certain measures should be taken to prevent it from happening. What moves the plot forwards is the path that Logan chooses. <br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, the greatest asset Singer had was the cast of First Class including James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence. This trio shared the major amount of screen time and they utilized it with electrifying performances. Others including Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen have also done their part impressively. Evans Peters as Quicksilver was a treat to watch and Peter Dinklage has done another important part. The visual effects and background scores were so much in tune with the visuals that it all came in as a single block of visual treat.<br/><br/>There isn't much of a negative side for the movie aside from a few facts that were left unanswered such as old Logan's metal claw and Kity's time-phasing power. Even though the movie is brilliant in its own marks, I won't deem it as the best of X-men since I still love X2 and First class the most. Still, the importance of this movie over the whole franchise is immense since it gave a new platform that can be used for a lot more movies, and lets hope 2016's Apocalypse going to utilize it to it's maximum....."

"gezza_stone","8","1","2","29 May 2014"," Just what the X-Men universe needed!
","At first I gave this film a 7/10 rating as I thought there wasn't enough action, but after I got home and thought back on the film I couldn't help but think that that rating didn't do the film justice. Yes, there wasn't as much action as I would have liked, but this film wasn't about the action. This film corrected a lot of the wrongs which were made in X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, so the 'talking' scenes were needed.<br/><br/>There were plenty of things I loved about this film: - Wolverine made this film for me! Hugh Jackman was brilliant once again, not just as the comedian of the film but also keeping you on the edge of your seat in other scenes. Just an overall great actor and perfect for his character.<br/><br/><ul><li>I loved the new characters that were introduced! Blink (Bingbing Fan) was my favourite and the way her teleportation power was portrayed in the film was amazing! Also, Bishop (Omar Sy) was another character who I enjoyed watching, and I definitely think we'll be seeing more of both of these either in their own origins films or in future X-Men films. The character I didn't think I would like was Quicksilver (Evan Peters); after seeing him in the trailer I assumed he was going to be cheesy and over the top cocky. However, I couldn't have been more wrong. Even though I thought the blue hair was a bit much, Peters did a brilliant job and his comment to Magneto about his 'mother dating a guy who could control metal' was a nice touch as well. Lastly, Toad's (Evan Jonigkeit) makeover in this film was a huge improvement from previous films in my opinion; just a pity we didn't see much of him.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>One thing I didn't like while watching the film was that there was no main mutant bad guy. Yet, as the film goes on you realise that this is where you see Magneto turning into that human hating villain we see in the first 3 X-Men films; which was brilliant!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In my opinion, the ending was perfect. After Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) stops Magneto and saves the future from the creation of the Sentinels, we see the dark future we've been watching all film disappear and we see Wolverine back at Xavier's school. Here, we see all the original cast back together (even Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Cyclopse/Scott Summers (James Marsden), and even Kelsey Grammar returns as Beast/Hank McCoy!) which really got me excited for what could happen in the future (an X-Men 4 and 5?!).</li></ul><br/><br/>There was only a few things which bothered me: - I thought this film was based a bit too much on Mystique, time which could have been used on other characters who didn't have much screen time; which leads me on my next point...<br/><br/><ul><li>Havoc/Alex Summer (Lucas Till) was one of my favourite characters in X-Men: First Class, and I just thought his cameo in this film was pointless. Really would have loved to have seen more of his character getting involved. Same with Toad and Quicksilver.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lastly, how is future Prof. X/Charles Xavier (Patrick Stuart) alive?! This still hasn't been explained and it really bothers me! I know we had that scene at the end of The Last Stand where we hear his voice in that other body which implies his consciousness is now in that body, but how is he back in his original body? I know I should probably just forget about that film but I just want an answer!</li></ul><br/><br/>All I can say is, thank you Bryan Singer; because this film was needed to bring balance back to this universe. Now I've seen this I can finally say I'm excited for the X-Men franchise to continue!"
"robiolowe","7","1","2","29 May 2014"," Over long....
","Watched XMen: Days of future past last night. A very well produced film and the costume/design guys done a great job between the future and the past. The story a good idea but (for me) they just dragged it out 20mins too much without ever adding any more real substance to what we already knew. The big scenes stole the show and the storyline 'stitching' and character interactions, developments, back stories fell a bit to the wayside. <br/><br/>You always know they going to be OK (as already signed up for the next xmen film) so you watch a film in very much a different way as know the expected ending before the film even starts. <br/><br/>A good film in the series but Xmen: First Class still my favourite one to date."
"saytosandeep","8","1","2","28 May 2014"," MY REVIEW: Days Worth Rememebring in Future!!
","X-Men: Days of Future Past. Arguably the best of X-Men series, not because it has every good thing we know X-Men for but because it manages to make a delicious cocktail of those good things and even makes you to think about watching the whole X-Men series from start to finish so that you can enjoy their journey to this future. Ranging from hugely popular Logan/Wolverine played by rough and tough Hugh Jackman, Mystique/Raven played by gorgeous and talented Jenifer Lawrence, Charles played by charming James McAvoy, Eric played by cunning and edgy Michael Fassbender and a long list of mutants played by credible actors is the whole and soul of this X-Men extravaganza. And if these were not enough, you have Quicksilver making his debut in a wonderful cameo during a critical prison break scene. I am sure Quicksilver will be next big things in Marvel's universe. Action set pieces are innovative, uncluttered and mesmerizing. Based on time travel theory, although movie does not quite exploit it fully but that's just nitpicking in otherwise two exciting hours of action and fun. Days of Future Past is a well wrapped gift to X-Men fans from Bryan Singer. I am going with strong 8 out of 10 for X-Men: Days of Future Past. It reminds you the wonderful fun of X-Men 2 and X-Men: First Class and lets you forgive the shortcomings of other X-Men movies."
"Zyuu","9","1","2","28 May 2014"," ...without spoiling anything, I will say this...
","I came into this movie with the highest of expectations, and it did not disappoint. ""Days"" ranks as one of the best Marvel movies to date, but is it the best one?<br/><br/>Marvel just gets better and better with their movie adaptations, and the way the time travel was handled and explained, it actually worked.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, but then again, what do you expect from this all star-studded cast? McAvoy, Fassbender, Stewart, McKellen, and Jackman are amazing established actors, but this stage belonged to Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, and to Evan Peters, who looked like he was having the time of his life in the role of Quicksilver.<br/><br/>There are going to be the detractors who are going to say the film had way too many characters and there was no character development. If anything, each character had decent time to showcase their powers, and in a film like this, that's about as much character development the audience needed (for those who do not follow the comic books).<br/><br/>So, in response to my earlier question<br/><br/>As much as I would love to give this movie a resounding ""Yes"" as the best Marvel film to datethat distinction still goes to ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier.""<br/><br/>And this is coming from an X-Men fan since '85.<br/><br/>But, damn, ""Days"" is an extremely close second"
"rannynm","10","1","2","28 May 2014"," Probably the Best X-Men Film Yet
","X-traordinarily perfect! I've been waiting for this movie for a while and what a payoff.<br/><br/>The future, as we know it, is a wasteland for mutants: hunted and eliminated by the Sentinels. To stop this from ever happening, Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is sent into the past to prevent this dark outcome. <br/><br/>I adore the X-Men series and to see it again is beyond fantastic. Bringing back the original iconic actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto) makes me overjoyed! Even the younger versions of them - Micheal Fassbender and James McAvory are their own 3-dimensional characters because they're not trying to be replicas of their older selves. Their interaction and relationships are strong and, just as in ""X-Men First Class,"" I love seeing Eric and Xavier just talking. These two started as friends and the film shows that perfectly. They have different pathways and ways to fix events but they never give up on each other. <br/><br/>The action and special effects in this film are grand. Showing different mutant powers is what made X-Men unique to begin with. It's not entirely combat action, like ""Avengers,"" it's more letting their powers do the work. Magneto slowly lifts an entire baseball stadium, which allows us to marvel at how powerful mutants can be.<br/><br/>The story is astounding! This film has to pick-up from the previous films and tie-up loose ends. Not only do they succeed but, they also remember little details. Example: the young Wolverine doesn't have metal claws. They're bone because he doesn't get the metal ones until sometime in the future. Specifics like that add to how incredible this film is. It can also confuse people who haven't seen the other films. There are inside jokes and character connections that could be lost. <br/><br/>My favorite character is Quicksilver (Evan Peters), a mutant who has incredible speed. This is by far the best representation of a comic-book character. Evan shows the mischievous and cocky side of Silver that is always a kick to watch.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is Quicksilver's super speed sequence. This is when the team breaks Eric/Magneto out of a Pentagon prison and the group is cornered by security. Quicksilver, without a care in the world, pranks the guards by poking the bullets in mid-air, pulling their guns out of their hands and more. This is such an incredible ride that it just needs to be experienced.<br/><br/>The message of this film is, ""Choices you make in the present, affect your future."" The whole reason for this story is that one careless act has changed the world forever. We need to think through the choices we make to have a bright future. <br/><br/>I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 13- to 18 year-olds. This film shows dark images and language that is not intended for younger audiences. <br/><br/>Keefer B., KIDSFIRST! Film Critic"
"jonymclaren","9","1","2","28 May 2014"," X-ccelent movie surpassing my expectations
","For someone who has never read the comics and is relatively new to the X-Men franchise, I thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish. When I saw X-men 1st Class, as it was a prequel, it was fairly easy for me to follow and thought it had a fairly good story, good acting and strong cast. However my biggest let down was the poor CGI effects at some points in the film. It's a small matter but little things like that can weaken a film for me. Therefore, I was glad to see that the previous's films short coming had been amended. X-men: Days of future past impressed me with a well driven story line switching from future to past which really worked well as the transitions were smooth and effective. The cast is also arguably the strongest line up in any X-men film with superb acting by the likes of Hugh Jackman, Michael Fassbender and Peter Dinklage playing this installments bad guy (to an extent). Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen also return for their old roles as Professor X and Magneto which is nice but they have considerably less screen time than their younger counterparts which is fine as the story primarily takes place when Professor X and Magneto were younger. <br/><br/>All in all, X-men: Days of future past is a well rounded movie which makes effective use of linking the past and the future well (even if it is a series reboot like Star Trek) and with good acting, light humor, comic book references and a good story, I would definitely recommend you watch this film even if you're not an X-Men fan. I would recommend you watch 1st Class beforehand to fill you in on some details though (or at least read up on it). Don't forget the clip at the very end of the credits too."
"bpalmer118","8","1","2","27 May 2014"," X-Men: Days of Future Past is perfection of the comic book genre; a must see film.
","For a movie that has it all (time travel, superheroes, action, all-star cast), Bryan Singer pulls off an impressive woven story that combines the old and younger X-Men together. I'm usually not a fan of Singer, but I walked away thoroughly impressed what he pulled off in this film. <br/><br/>Using the trick from the time travel play book of Star Trek, Singer has set up the franchise in a way to bring back all the characters killed off from X-Men: The Last Stand. Yet, this time travel device was unique from anything I've ever seen on film because instead of physically sending someone back in time, their conscious was transported back which restricted who could travel back in time and how long ago they could go. <br/><br/>A much younger Whiplash was also a nice dose of action and humor to the film with a action sequence that is up there with the Matrix. With one of the biggest all-star casts ever assembled next to the Avengers, Michael Fassbender shines as Magento once again with true performance that gives life to an otherwise far-fetched plot. James McAvoy returns as the younger Charles Xavier giving an excellent performance as well. <br/><br/>However, the reason I gave this movie an 8/10 is because I wasn't wholly satisfied after the credits rolled. The film didn't utilize the powerhouse duo of Patrick Stewart or Ian McKellen. It also didn't establish the present dystopia world in order to rush to the time travel part. The CGI was very mediocre for the Sentinels in the present time and I didn't buy the action. I wish they had attempted more real-life sequences and spent more time setting up the film and giving more thought to the CGI effects. <br/><br/>Overall, Bryan Singer hits a home run with this film by giving audiences exactly what they want: a comic book movie that plays like a comic book with stellar performances by Fassbender and McAvoy. A must see film for any comic book fans."
"melgarcia40","8","1","2","27 May 2014"," Very good for the genre but...
","The X-Men movies X1, X2 and First Class always felt superior to me to loads of other superheroes movies, save Nolan's two last Batman maybe, because the action and the special effects are not what drives the movie, it is definitely their characters, and that makes the X-men movies far superior to me. Which is why the third one was so terribly awful: Rattner forgot all about what the first two ones were about, made it the Wolverine show, and forgot totally about the heart of the story.<br/><br/>Days of Future Past is a great movie in this regard: the trio Charles/Erik/Raven is what is at the core of it, they are what makes the movie engaging, and of course, the cast is excellent. James Mcavoy is an exceptionally talented actor, particularly when it comes to portray the emotions of his character. Charles sentiment of loss, whether regarding Raven, Erik, or his hope in general is brilliantly portrayed, and the shared scene he has with Patrick Stewart is a highlight of the movie. Jenifer Lawrence is equally as compelling and subtle in her embodiment of Mystique and her inner conflict towards which choice to make, and whose line of thoughts (Charles or Erik's). Michael Fassbender as usual is perfect as Magneto and commands the screen effortlessly.<br/><br/>The breakout star really is Evan Peters as Quicksilver, who shines in every scene he is in, and provides a great comic relief in an otherwise pretty dark movie.<br/><br/>It was also great to see both casts mixed together in this installment, even if it meant that some had very limited screen time, and I was very, very pleased that, also inconsistent, the ending allowed to set straight where X3 screwed up and brought back Cyclops and Jean (Cyclops treatment and relegation to the second plan in favor of Wolverine in comparison to the comics being my major quip with Bryan Singer). <br/><br/>Now I don't think that DOFP was better than First Class, mainly because of the time loop issues. Time travel always made me cringed because of the inconsistencies it creates, and the movies falls at the very beginning into the plot hole, since it is the premise of the movie. Indeed Wolverine is sent in the past to prevent the war. But then, if the war never happens, then there is no need to send him back in the past. If there is no need to send him, then he is not sent in the past. If he is not sent in the past, then the war happens... the paradox can't be solved, and the story is not possible.<br/><br/>This is a major plot hole to go over, but other than that, the rest is really, really good. I definitely rank it among the top 5 of the superheroes movies ever made."

","As you read my review, I will not give any spoilers whatsoever because the movie is still being shown in theaters must not give anything away for those who have not seen the movie. So I am not going to, but I do hope you enjoy reading my review. I just saw ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" in theaters, and I really love it. As you read the title of my review, you know what I am talking about; everyone had problems with the series on one thing which you probably may have read about, but now everyone does not have to worry because the movie has finally set things right. Remember I said in my review of ""The Wolverine"" if ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" was going to top ""The Wolverine,"" and might consider this movie that I saw in theaters might be my favorite? Well as I saw the movie in theaters, I now consider this and ""The Wolverine"" as my two favorite X-Men movies of the series. I am pleased to have Bryan Singer returning in director's chair since he was absent on directing the other X-Men movies. This is probably Bryan Singer's best work for directing an X-Men besides the first two movies that he directed. The story is extremely well told, and it really does stay true the comics besides some of the changes that were made in the final cut of the movie. I am also pleased to have John Ottman returning for working on the music of the movie as he did with the second X-Men movie; he also did edit film and I thought it was well edited. The cast in this movies was incredible. I thought it was cool to have the original cast meeting with the cast of ""X-Men: First Class."" Hugh Jackman is still awesome as the Wolverine and really does manage to keep us entertain as the movie goes. James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen were also great in it; same goes to Jennifer Lawrence. I was like on the edge of my seat as I was watching the movie from beginning to end, when things go wrong and hopefully that our heroes will succeed. I really love this movie, and I am giving it a 10 out of 10. The X-Men series is back to its original roots, and I am more than happy that they are keeping this franchise alive."
"judywalker2","7","1","2","26 May 2014"," Just okay
","Saw X men today and I was really expecting something great if you read the reviews but I have to say it was just okay. I guess I must be suffering from superhero overload because I just can't get in to one movie after another that is about wanted destruction of some city. I guess my biggest gripe about this movie is that once again it's just the Wolverine show. Yes Professor X and Magneto are in the movie along with Beast and few others (yes the speedy guy was funny) but most are just window dressing for another Wolverine story. I wish we had gotten to see more of the Sentinels. I wish we had been about to see them from inception to the end. That might have been a halfway decent movie plot instead we get lets go back in time to save ourselves from these really cool robots. Too bad."
"ccponds","8","1","2","26 May 2014"," Redemption for a Stagnating Franchise
","I have been an X-Men fan since I was kid. I grew up with my dad reading the comics to me and playing the board games that existed at the time. I collected action figures and of course am a huge fan of the first two X-Men films that Bryan Singer made. This film ranks up with them, although it is not without its own flaws. It has some of the best scenes in the entire franchise, but it also has a few moments that sort of felt rushed or written wrong.<br/><br/>As my review title suggests, this film has certainly redeemed the franchise as a whole. Several missteps that had been made by previous films have been corrected and this is certainly going to be welcome news to die-hard comic fans. However, because of the reset that this film has sort of accomplished, it now raises a number of questions. Will Wolverine have adamantium claws in the sequel film(s)? Will Charles Xavier ever go into Logan's mind and see what the past was originally set as? Are characters such as Blink, Bishop, Sunspot, and Warpath going to return? There are a lot of questions that I would love to know the answer to right now, but I guess that is another story for another day. <br/><br/>Probably the largest complaint I had about this film was the fact that it was advertised to focus on both the past and the future, yet it is roughly 85% past and only 15% future. The salvation of the film is that Wolverine, Charles, and Erick are not the only main characters. What broke up this monotony was the more prominent role that Nicholas Hoult plaid as Beast and seeing Jennifer Lawrence reprise her role as Mystique; both excellent characters in the movie acting and story wise.<br/><br/>The most disappointing part of the film for me was that it did not feature enough of the Sentinels. If the film had seen them hunting mutants more than it did, I think that it would have made their on screen presence more intimidating. Don't get me wrong, they are a force to be reckoned with, but I feel that they were sort of wasted at times. The future only sees them in two brief fights. Interestingly, they remind me an awful lot of the silver giant from Thor, the one that fights Thor on earth and releases fire from its head. Watching the fights in this film, I felt that once again the threat was not really the Sentinels, but rather it was that Erick would screw up the past even worse than it had already been. I am still waiting for an X-Men movie where we actually get to see mutants in a flat out battle against mutants: the X-Men vs. the Brotherhood.<br/><br/>No doubt there is a future for this franchise, but with Apocalypse looming on the horizon, I would not exactly call it a ""bright"" one. Apocalypse has as likely a chance of ending of giving us the first truly spectacular mutant vs. mutant fight, but it could also be the film that just might end the series on a low note. Days of Future Past was a good film that made up for the problems that other X- Men films have made, but I couldn't help but feel (at times) that this was a large part of why the film took the direction it did. I honestly enjoyed it, and will see it again on Blu-ray, but I do hope that the next film will finally unleash Wolverine to his full potential WHILE still allowing other mutants to shine as they did in this film. Nevertheless, this film is definitely worth seeing if one has the time and money. Just make sure you do not take any friends that have not seen every X-Men film, or spin off, up to The Wolverine.<br/><br/>I would give this movie and 8.5 out of 10 if that was an option."
"mcw-weiler","7","1","2","26 May 2014"," Good Action..BUT
","Great story line and action. . . BUT what's up with the F bomb language? Did it add to the plot or action? NO, not at all – it really does need to be in the movie. Marvel movies don't need it and Families do not want to hear it. If it's a Marvel movie, which essentially a comic book movie, I am bringing my kids to the movie. I don't need to be hit with F bombs and butts. It doesn't add ""jack"" to the movie. Thanks, but no thanks. Hollywood wake up. Keep the F bomb language and Hugh Jackmans butt off the screen.<br/><br/>On a positive note, they did a great job of retro back to the 70's.

","This was a well constructed movie with some very good action scenes there to enhance the story rather than to make the story.<br/><br/>The acting is of top quality. You forget that you are watching some of the best actors applying their trade McKellen, McAvoy, Fassbender, Stewart, Jackman, Lawrence, Berry, etc.<br/><br/>All Marvel movies should be directed by either Singer, Webb or Whedon. Singer makes the recent productions of the Thor franchise, Iron-Man 2 & 3 look amateurish.<br/><br/>There were some bits in the X-men movie that did not look quite right and this is true of all the X-men movie, is the age of the characters. I know Wolverine ages very slowly but does that apply to all mutant as Magneto, Professor X and some of the other characters should be a bit older or look older.<br/><br/>Some of the technology looked too advanced and way ahead of Stark industry for the periods.<br/><br/>These are minor point to what was a very entertaining and enjoyable movie."
"rajshah991","9","1","2","26 May 2014"," The best of X-men is here!
","The days of the future past is then a sequel to both x men the last stand and x men first class. The movie is based on the background that; in the future the sentinels are wiping out the race of the mutants and wolverine is sent back into the 70's to eliminate the sentinels before they are ever created. It is really difficult to find any flaws with the movie.Bryan singer has done an exceptional job and could have possibly returned with the best x-men movie we have seen.<br/><br/>The character of James McAvoy which feels more moderated and is since x- men first class. Unlike the mentor figure of professor X who is a bit grim to relate to. There is also extremely clever humour in the movie like when quicksilver/peter rescues Charles Xavier, wolverine and Eric lehnsherr from the security in pentagon. The movie feels really well connected even when there are no fight scenes, like in the scene; where Eric lehnsherr and Charles Xavier are talking there is not any action going on but you're really interested in the conversation. You can just feel the endless amount of back story already taken place between them. That's one of the best ways to present compelling characters. <br/><br/>The main characters of the movie are mystique and wolverine. Jennifer Lawrence has done an incredible job with her character, but Hugh Jackman has done even better (as expected). He takes off from where he left of in X-men last stand and you can feel the good old bad ass wolverine. <br/><br/>There are just so many characters in the movie and that can be easily messed up. But Bryan is able to make all those characters to relate to the central story even emotionally and that's when it really works well. Overall it's the X-men movie we have been waiting for and are much pleased to see that it delivers the expectations."
"Screen_Blitz","10","1","2","26 May 2014"," Stunning
","I can't tell you how incredible this was. This would probably the best film of X-men series, why? First, the story was fantastic and never lost my attention. Secondly, the characters were pretty amazing, especially Wolverine. While he always the central character of the franchise, Hugh Jackman portrays him well and his performances never gets old. Jennifer Lawrence also did decent job as Mystique. The rest of the characters were pretty good as well.<br/><br/>The fight action scenes were definitely the best parts of the movie, mostly because of its eye popping special(and visual) effects. The opening scene with the mutants fighting against the sentinel robots and the final battle towards the end were my favorite scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>This is best movie I've seen this year so far. I'm excited for the this series next installment, which is called X-Men Apocalypse and set to be released in May 2016."
"macarefilms","8","1","2","26 May 2014"," A Near Perfect Film!
","X-Men: Days of Future Past, simply, is not just a good superhero film but a good film. <br/><br/>It excels in all areas of its acting, directing, script and effects. <br/><br/>Featuring the blend of the two generations of X-Men, DOFP feels like an X-Men movie should. It ditched the overly cheesy story of origins and features more heart than The last Stand. It also vastly improves on the characters first introduced in First Class. <br/><br/>The real heart of the movie though is the performances. Hugh Jackman, Ian Mckellen and Patrick Stewart bring it as always but the real standout of the cast is James McAvoy as a young Charles Xavier. McAvoy really shows us the beaten down and depressed hippie that Xavier has become. His performance is one of the best parts of the film. <br/><br/>Although the best part of the film must be twenty minutes half way through the film when the Wolverine and Xabier need help from a young mutant. It adds a nice comedic touch that X-Men movies always have. <br/><br/>One of the only problems with the film is the under use of the actors. Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen were horribly underused when their presence is always enjoyable. <br/><br/>The only other issue is the time travel which is inevitable in any movie with time travel as it never makes any sense. The ending involving time travel feels very cheap and somewhat detracts from the rest of the film. <br/><br/>Overall, these issues don't ruin the entire film and it is still a very enjoyable ride that just narrowly beats out X2 as the best X-Men film to date. <br/><br/>(Here's hoping Apocalypase doesn't ruin this.)"
"Seraphion","8","1","2","26 May 2014"," One of the rare gems of this year's movies
","The story follows Wolverine as his mind is sent back through time, using Kitty Pride's powers, into his old body to stop a losing war between mutants and the robotic anti-mutant Sentinels. He then finds and convinces young Charles/Professor X and Hank/Beast to help him. Charles is able to walk by taking Beast's serum, in exchange of temporarily losing his mutant powers. Aided by Quicksilver, they free Erik/Magneto from his concrete prison. Logan tells the group that the war starts from the moment Raven/Mystique kills Trask, the scientist who designs the Sentinels. The group catches Raven just as she's about to kill Trask and her cover is blown. Trask escapes and Erik shoots Raven to prevent anyone getting her DNA that can help Sentinels against the mutants. Hank disrupts Erik but he manages to fire and hit Raven. Logan sees Stryker in the room and he goes haywire, injuring Kitty in the present. Erik keeps on hunting Raven, as bystanders watch in horror, but Beast tackles Erik as Raven escapes. Erik manages to escape after subduing Beast. People panicked at the sight of mutant powers in public and Trask wins funding for the Sentinels. <br/><br/>Raven ambushes Erik, but Erik tells her Trask has gotten her DNA from the blood on the street. When Logan's group reaches home, Charles goes ill as he needs the serum. Logan convinces Charles not to take it and to read his mind, by which the old and young Charles converse. Erik slips into the Sentinel shipment and reconfigure the non-metal Sentinels into having metals. Charles locates Raven but fails to stop her. Logan's group then goes to the Sentinel launching event in the White House to stop her. Erik goes to the same venue. Logan's group arrives then Charles locates and subdues Raven. Suddenly the Sentinels, under Erik's control, turns on and go haywire so the VIPs flee to a vault bunker. Erik then drops a stadium around the White House, pinning Charles in the debris. Erik yanks the vault up. At the present, fighting also rages on and the mutants slowly but surely losing their ground, dying one by one. <br/><br/>Logan and Hank attacks Erik, but he sends a Sentinel on them. Hank handles the Sentinel, but Erik incapacitates Logan, tying him with metal bars then throws him into the river. Erik then rips open the vault and makes a speech about the mutant world order. Raven, disguised as the President goes out from the vault and challenges Erik. Hank patches his serum and the Sentinel goes from him into targeting Erik and Raven. Erik disjoints the robot and Raven shoot him and removes his helmet. Charles then subdues Erik but Raven aims then gun to Trask. Charles reasons with her. As the present Sentinels fire beams to kill the remaining Logan and Kitty, they all disappear. Raven yields in, dropping the gun thus altering the future. Logan wakes up in the present Xavier school, seeing all those who have died still live. He meets Charles and Charles realizes that it is the Logan from the past and begins explaining what Logan has missed from the past to this altered reality.<br/><br/>The base story is just exceptionally great. Though it's not as epic as other sci-fi gems, but it's able to present a complex story without differing from the original comics story characteristics. It is by far the first movie to successfully marry the concepts of super-powers and time-travel in one story and executes the story greatly. <br/><br/>The movie also offer some epic moments, some never before seen in any movie. I personally liked the Quicksilvers resonating hands and of course Magneto's stadium drop. The dialog contains many catchy comments. I liked Magneto's words to Logan as seeing his claws ""Imagine that with metal"" that sounded just as vividly as a premonition of what is to come.<br/><br/>One thing that's not so satisfying is that the movie looks to be too limited by a duration length target that it doesn't spare any character development on any of the newly appearing mutants. I just hope that they get more spotlight in the next movie.<br/><br/>There is little to complain about the acting. A-list cast of stars is a great choice in doing this movie. The parts composition for each characters is great, able to showcase the senior talents in enough duration and at the same time still keeping the younger and newer talents to keep the lead roles. Hugh Jacman's Logan is an exception on this though, due to his character have a great relevance to the story's technical aspect.<br/><br/>The score department is good that is helps to build the scenes' mood well, keeping the focus at the characters and without being overbearing. The costumes and set department did great in reliving the 1970s era in the movie, though unfortunately, there's not much scenes that focus on things that are particularly special to that era.<br/><br/>From me, I'm glad to say that this is one of the most deserving 8 out of 10 scoring movie this year, and a recommendation is an absolute certain yes. I watched this in the streaming sites, and will definitely watch this again on DVD or any other higher quality medias."
"TheMovieSnob247","8","1","2","25 May 2014"," Believe the hype! Days of Future Past succeeds where so many action films fail.
","We begin in a very bleak future. Mutants are fighting a war they cannot win as next generation sentinels have pushed them to the verge of extinction. The last remaining mutant survivors converge on a single location and hold out for one last stand. Magneto and Professor X have identified a singular event in the past that was the catalyst for their current predicament. If they can prevent this from occurring, they can save not only themselves, but most of humanity. The strain of travelling back in the past on the subconscious is significant however and given his regenerative mutant powers, only Wolverine can survive the journey. Once back in time, Wolverine must race against time to convince the younger Magneto and Professor X to put aside their differences and unite in order to change the course of the future before the sentinels discover their future holdout and wipe them out. <br/><br/>Days of Future Past is a fantastic film. Most summer movies have tonnes of action and special effects, but they mostly fail to cast good, convincing actors, create sufficient drama or develop the story necessary to make the action scenes resonate and be meaningful (Godzilla anyone?). This film excels in this regard. Time is taken to develop the story and the inner conflict of Professor X, Mystique and Magneto as they struggle with overcoming personal fear, rejection, past differences and whether or not they can trust not only themselves, but also the humans. The slight downside of this is the film is a little slow in the middle, but this is pivotal to the effectiveness of the last act. Having said that, at no point does the film drag on and Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Evan Peters (Quick Silver) provide plenty of humour to keep what is mostly a dark narrative light and enjoyable. Admittedly, as in all time travel movies, not everything totally adds up when you think through all the permutations of how this affects the previous films, events and characters in the Marvel universe. For the most part the story isn't convoluted and is entertaining throughout. <br/><br/>The film has excellent casting, from top to bottom and I would say this is the best cast Marvel film to date. There are no unnecessary characters or weak performances; every character plays a key role in the story and is convincing. Hugh Jackman continues to be excellent as Wolverine (sadly, they still can't seem to make a great movie where he is the headline). Michael Fassbender (Magneto) and James McAvoy (Professor Xavier) once again provide solid performances and along with Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique) are the emotional centre of the film and elevate it above the usual summer fair. Peter Dinklage (Dr. Trask) isn't given much to work with, but he delivers a fairly serviceable performance. I also really appreciated that Bryan Singer provided some of the lessor known X-Men such as Bishop and Blink with meaningful screen time. All in all, this is as good as you can get for such a large, ensemble cast; full marks across the board. <br/><br/>The highlight of the film for me though was the future sentinels; they were fantastic! The special effects for these are incredible and they are the catalyst for some amazing battles in the future story arc. While I was a little disappointed in the interpretation of sentinels of the past (as they weren't quite how I remembered them from the Saturday morning FOX cartoon of my childhood), the design and action sequences with them more than made up for it as they were so well done (and that is an understatement!). Very impressive special effects overall and plenty of action to keep even the most ardent fan boy satisfied. This has to be seen in a higher end theatre such as IMAX or UltraAVX.<br/><br/>The film brings together a strong balance of action, good story telling and meaningful performances that lead to an emotionally jarring conclusion as the X-Men fight to survive in both the past and future. As the story lines converge it was impossible not only to be on the edge of my seat as it came to a thrilling conclusion, but also to be invested in their struggle. It was reminiscent of the last act of The Dark Knight, it was that good. This is the perfect summer movie and not to be missed by Marvel or action fans. Not only does it challenge as the best Marvel film yet, it's also the best film of 2014 to date.<br/><br/>www.themoviesnob.ca<br/><br/>@the_movie_snob"

","After X-men First Class, the X-men franchise was given a breath of fresh air. This movie continues the same level of of quality story telling and great characters. The beginning of the movie and future scenes felt very similar to the bleak future portrayed in Terminator, after judgement day. The streets are littered with bones, the skies are dark, and sentinel carrying ships are tracking down the X-men. The main cast members are all back, and once again McAvoy, Fassbender, their older counter-parts, and everyone else are totally in character. Although Jennifer Lawerence wasn't given much to work with in the first one, she definitely holds her own with some great talent. I feel that the last X-men had Fassbender steal the show, in this one, McAvoy steals the show with his portrayal of a broken Professor X. I also liked how the time travel technique was different from most other movies. Some really cool mutant powers were introduced, such as Blink with her portals and Quicksilver with his superspeed.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW (mini-criticism)<br/><br/>The after-credits scene seemed very unpolished, and almost had video- game level graphics for the special effects. I'd prefer that directors simply withhold these kinds of teases, when clearly they don't have the time or resources for the correct effect. A similar problem existed for Thor 2, which had a very cartoonish after-credits scene that may be corrected in Guardians of Galaxy."
"dfranzen70","9","1","2","25 May 2014"," It's going to be tough to top this.
","X-Men: Days of Future Past sort of blew me away. And here's the kicker - you don't need to have seen the previous movies in the series to understand what's going on. There's an unerring blend of past and present characters, real heart-in-your-throat tension, and stunning effects. Yeah, so I sort of liked it a little bit.<br/><br/>I don't mean to fawn, but sometimes it's appropriate. This is a great movie. In a nutshell, here's your story. It's sometime in the future (2029? not sure). The Sentinels, robots built with the sole purpose of eradicating all mutants, are on the rampage, tracking said mutants down and slaughtering them, full stop. In fact, they've become so advanced that when a mutant defends against/attacks a Sentinel, that mutant's powers are absorbed by that Sentinel. Get it? It's a bad scene. <br/><br/>Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Ian McKellan), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and other assorted X people have holed up in the middle of nowhere, awaiting their doom. Xavier believes that the only way to stop the war on mutants (and on sympathetic humans, by the way, in case you missed the analogy) is to travel back in time to prevent the creation of the Sentinels in 1973. Now, Professor X wants to be sent back (don't worry, Kitty Pryde is on the job), but because of the long time period between '73 and the present, Pryde thinks the journey would snap even the Professor's mind. Instead, they opt to send Wolverine back, because he's essentially unchanged from 1973 (more-or- less ageless, really) and would therefore adjust better to the trip. And so back he goes.<br/><br/>A solo, rogue mission by Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), in an effort to destroy Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), the creator of the Sentinels, merely gave the public and the government cause to turn on the mutants, thus sparking the war. So: Wolverine is to locate Mystique and persuade her to give up her cause, and he won't be able to do so without the help of...the younger Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Aye, there's the rub, huh? Older, wiser Magneto regrets fighting Charles Xavier all those years, but younger, angrier Magneto isn't so shrewd. (They're just like people!)<br/><br/>So there's your setup. Young Magneto is being held secretly about 100 stories below the Pentagon in a super-ultra-mega-maximum security cell for the murder of...well, never mind. Young Xavier, on the other hand, is hiding out at his School for Gifted Youngsters, which no longer is a school nor houses youngsters, except for Beast, who helps his mentor faithfully. Thus the movie unites not only good mutants and bad mutants but younger and older versions of themselves, more or less. And because of the trippy time shenanigans, you could possibly see familiar mutants, from movies other than the First Class one. Sounds like this would make for a crowded cast, but the action centers around the younger Magneto and Xavier, Mystique, Wolverine, and the younger Beast (Nicholas Hoult). <br/><br/>It feels so good to have Bryan Singer back behind the wheel. The story flows in sync with the dazzling, but not distracting, effects, as if a steady-handed auteur was in charge. This feels like the most authentic and personal X-Men film to date, and I (yeah, yeah) liked each of the others. And heaven forfend if I bust out a spoiler, but you know what they say about time-travel movies: they can change things, man."

"TheMediumC","9","1","2","25 May 2014"," X-Men: DoFP = Not Just Another Superhero Movie
","I saw X-Men: Days of Future Past twice now. And man; it IS a good movie. First of all, X- Men series always weighs more than other superhero movies because it is built on very strong issues such as: discrimination, self-control, alienation, balance, racism in some level, a persons inner fight to be better... So as a result, the X-Men movies become more than just some superhero movies with people who can do interesting things in it. These are REAL movies and behind all that imaginative world, dealing with REAL things that we can all relate to. <br/><br/>Days of Future Past is one of the best-seller stories amongst all the Marvel stories for 20 years now. So it is normal to have high expectations from the movie. But the thing is while I was looking forward to see DoFP, I told myself to lower my expectations because I liked X- Men: First Class more than any superhero movie before (and I am quite the nerd on that end) It couldn't have been better than First Class, right? Well, sorry ""me"" from 3 days earlier, you were wrong... <br/><br/>DoFP is an ensemble movie and we know that Singer is very good at those. (I mean, Usual Suspect right?) It gathers a lot of the original cast and the younger-self cast together in a story that would make you believe. The action scenes are just enough and well-balanced with everything else. I always thought since First Class started and ended with ""Magneto"" and more than anyone we saw him develop through the story, it was actually Magneto's movie. And now I am sure of that cause this one starts and ends with Prof. X and he is the one who develops through the story this time and boy, did James McAvoy done a good job with it! Amazing. His acting is superb, along with the others. <br/><br/>The future scenes convince you on their side while the 70's look just like 70's with costumes, usage of technology of that time, with designs and with dialogs... And there aren't as much as plot holes as they say, who says that just didn't watch that movie and the others very carefully... Just some holes on the time traveling - changing the past side but hey, it is the destiny of all time traveling movies isn't it? And DoFP did a better job at this than many other. <br/><br/>I can say so much more about this movie but I am sure if you are a true fan of X-Men on screen, you'll feel the same way anyway. This movie will stuck with you for some time because and I repeat of its depth. It is not just a super-hero movie. It is a treat for anyone who loves a good movie but also; it is everything you could've asked for if you are a true X-Men fan on screen."

","X-Men: First Class was a successful movie and a most needed breath of fresh air in the franchise, but everyone knew that the X-Men franchise would be getting its real rebirth once Bryan Singer returned in the director's chair. It took over 10 years, but Bryan Singer finally returned with X-Men: Days of Future Past, which isn't the best X-men movie there is (X2 is still holding that title), but is damn near being so. X-Men: Days of Future Past is the first movie in the franchise that introduces a time traveling element in the plot, in an attempt to fix any continuity errors between X-Men: First Class and the rest of the franchise.<br/><br/>In the future, the world has been torn apart by a war between the mutants and Sentinels (giant robots made for killing mutants). In a desperate attempt, the last several surviving mutants send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing the creator of the Sentinels, Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), because that event apparently triggered the mutant/Sentinel war. But Wolverine can't find Mystique alone – he needs help from the younger versions of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). However, Charles Xavier is addicted to a medicine that helps him walk, but makes him lose his mutant powers, and Magneto is locked up in a super secret prison below the Pentagon.<br/><br/>The plot Days of Future Past isn't a rather simple one – the movie occasionally shifts focus from the past to the future and back again. The plot is mostly described through exposition, in form of dialogue between characters. The quality of these expository dialogues isn't always that good; especially in the beginning of the movie, when the characters explain to the audience the whole back story in 30 seconds flat. Nonetheless, after getting by that forced exposition, the movie suddenly starts being quite enjoyable, fun and interesting. Days of Future Past is possibly the funniest X-Men movie there is, filled with pleasant characters (Quicksilver, played by Evan Peters, stands out the most), great action sequences, and numerous amusing references to other movies in the franchise.<br/><br/>All the actors in the movie, with a few exceptions, are comfortable in their roles and are as good as ever (after all – the majority of them portrayed these characters at least once before). The exceptions to this rule are Ellen Page and Jennifer Lawrence. Ellen Page, in spite of having a very short screen time, is very unconvincing in her role; and Jennifer Lawrence is unusually wooden, which is a shame since she is the almost sole cast member who has won an Oscar. Thankfully, there is much going on in the movie, so it's not like their performances badly hurt Days of Future Past. On the contrary, the movie could actually be hurt by its third act which doesn't feel like a real finale. Instead, it is a very mild ending to a highly entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"
"usaamansari","10","1","2","25 May 2014"," The X Franchise Comes Full Circle
","I am compelled to write this review, that is how good this film was. X-Men DoFP, in my opinion, builds upon its predecessor i.e. First Class and man does it deliver? It is everything one can expect from a sequel-prequel-hybrid. The Sentinels were brutal & ruthless killing machines, the way they should be and honestly I was a bit skeptical going in.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer proves that he is a force to be reckoned with. Call it his comeback, rebirth or his love for the franchise but he didn't disappoint one bit in the director's chair. The cameos were a welcome sight with just the right amount of humor at every turn. Not to mention, it was superbly written with attention to most tiny details (or what the film could manage, considering two simultaneous time lines).<br/><br/>A must watch. Love it or hate it, with this latest entry, the franchise has come full circle. Countdown until Apocalypse = T-2yrs.<br/><br/>My rating: 8.5/10"
"Carycomic","10","1","2","24 May 2014"," This more than makes up for the Matthew Vaughn travesty X-MEN: LOW CLASS.
","For starters, it provides a suitable explanation for Stewart-Xavier's restored mobility in the flashback prologue of X-MEN 3: THE LAST STAND. It also provides a suitable substitute for the character of Robert Kelly, who was the predestined target of assassination in the original Chris Claremont comic book story. But, who (as played by Bruce Davison) was killed off in the very first X-MEN movie, as all true fans of that film remember.<br/><br/>The mutant rebels in the opening action scene were also intriguing. In addition to returning favorites like Iceman, Shadowcat, and Colossus, there were also relative newcomers Bishop (no mistaking those dreadlocks!) and Sunspot. Although, I have to confess; Adan Canto, the actor portraying the latter, bore a slightly greater resemblance to the actress who played Callisto in X-3! In fact, I was thinking to myself, while watching the opening battle of this film: <br/><br/>""Is this supposed to be Callisto's dystopian future-son by Cannonball?!""<br/><br/>Then, there's Peter Dinklage who played Bolivar Trask. I loved it when he played Arthur Ramsey, the egotistical mental giant recruited for the alien-busting Federal task force in THRESHOLD (the short-lived, and criminally under-rated, 2005 CBS sci-fi series). And, the believability he brought to that role he transferred to his depiction of Trask with absolutely no trouble, at all!<br/><br/>For me, however, the highlight of the film was the new meaning Bryan Singer gave to the old phrase, ""a meeting of the minds,"" when he had Stewart-Xavier telepathically confer with his younger self (convincingly played, once again, by James MacEvoy).<br/><br/>In short, then, I think the X-men movie franchise has been safely re-secured. Thanks to Bryan Singer being once more at the directorial helm."
"rtp4242","9","1","2","24 May 2014"," X-men Days of Future Past. Happy Days, indeed.
","The future is bleak for mutants and the humans who help them. Robots, named sentinels are hunting down mutants to the point of extinction. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan) are holed up in a bunker with the last few surviving mutants. They decide to send Logan (Hugh Jackman) back to 1973, with the help of Kitty Pride (Ellen Page) who has the ability to teleport people's consciousness back in time. Logan is chosen because his mind is the only mind strong enough to withstand the process.<br/><br/>Logan must go back to 1973 to convince Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) not to shoot the inventor of the sentinels, Dr. Bolivar Trask. (Peter Dinklage) He must also find and reunite the younger Xavier (James McAvoy) and Eric (Michael Fassbender) and convince them to work together to bring Raven back from the precipice of being an assassin. With the help of Peter/Quicksilver, (Even Peters) Logan breaks Eric out of a prison in the Pentagon. Xavier meanwhile has become somewhat of a recluse, living in his school for mutants, which is now in disrepair, with Hank/Beast (Nicholas Hoult) Hank has cured Xavier's paralysis, but the serum he uses, robs Xavier of his mental acuity. Moreover, Xavier doesn't want anything to do with his powers anymore, he blames his powers, and Eric for losing Raven, and causing his paralysis. Can Logan convince these former friends, now rivals to bury the hatchet, find Raven, and convince her not to kill Dr. Trask? Or do Xavier and Eric's doubts about themselves and human beings overwhelm them?<br/><br/>I love this movie. There are simply not enough superlatives to tell you how good this movie is. It integrates the best of the first series of X-Men movies with the best of the reboot. The sentinels do remind me a bit of the robots from the Terminator movies, and there is the usual time travel caveat about changing the future, but this time they want to change the future. There's also a good bit of historical fiction about the Vietnam War, the Kennedy assassination and the Nixon administration, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Nixon is a villain in this movie, and that will either enrage you or delight you depending on your political views. This kind of historical fiction was tried in the movie The Watchmen, but I found that history muddled and incomprehensible, the flashbacks to the 70's was a loving, nostalgic look at an era I look back on with fondness. Days of Future Past is also disarmingly funny, the script had me laughing out loud at times. Other than Nolan's Dark Knight movies, this is the best superhero film I've seen in a very long time.<br/><br/>What can I say about the acting? It is first rate. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan bring the same heft and gravitas to these characters that made me love them in the first place. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are put in a tough position, being in the same movie playing the same characters as these iconic actors, but they not only hold their own, but make the characters their own. Michel Fassbender is becoming a great actor in his own right, it's getting to the point where I could watch him in any movie he makes. Hugh Jackman has played Logan/Wolverine in at least seven movies now, and I can't imagine anyone else playing him, he is Wolverine. Nicholas Hoult is good as Beast, Xavier's right hand man, Ellen Page brings some Inception style earnestness to her role. Evan Peters is very funny as Quicksilver, and Peter Dinklage gives a standout performance as the evil Dr. Trask. The only fly in the ointment was Jenner Lawrence, she actually made me realize how good Rebecca Romiijn was as Raven, she was much more edgy and mature. Jennifer Lawrence seems like she's trying really hard to be edgy, but doesn't quite make it. I think she is too young for this role, not to mention her role in American Hustle.<br/><br/>The direction is good, fast paced and action packed, the 2 hours and 10 minutes flew by. The 3D effects, didn't really add much I'm sorry to say. There is violence and nudity, so don't bring the young kids, they won't like seeing Hugh Jackman's bare posterior as much as their mothers might.<br/><br/>For more X-cellent movie reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"

"emmy-freeman","10","1","2","24 May 2014"," Saved the franchise and started a new one
","In my opinion, this movie filled the hole that X-men: The Last Stand and X-men Origins: Wolverine made with the X-men franchise. X-men: First Class clawed the franchise out of its hole. Bringing Bryan Singer back was a smart move. Honestly, this movie exceeded my expectations! They did a good thing bringing back the old cast, and also bringing in new ones. There is a good blend of action, comedy, drama, and sci-fi. And the made a smart move with the end credits scene. Like most moviegoers, people (like me) would have to do some research and find out that it's a lead up to X-men: Apocalypse. Now I'm super excited again! I applaud you good, smart movie company! *CLAPCLAPCLAPCLAP* Bryan Singer did an excellent job casting, directing, and doing a quality job overall. And someone give a raise to whomever wrote this script! I'm serious! Excellent movie!!! (also I still gave a spoiler, but no major, major ones that's the best part of the movie!) http://screenrant.com/x-men-days-of-future-past-spoilers-end-post- credits-scene-apocalypse/2/ Here's if you want to learn more about the end credits scene!!"
"stefanosf","10","1","2","24 May 2014"," X-Men: Days of Future Past is the key for the super-hero-movie evolution.
","Back in 2000, X-Men was relished, and it proved that super-hero films can be realistic and serious. In 2003, X2 proved that sequels can be even better. X-Men: The Last Stand proved that super-heroes films can be huge disappointments. Then X-Men Origins: Wolverine was even worse. The Wolverine a bigger improvement than Origins, but again it wasn't full filing. But in 2011, X-Men: First Class brought back hopes for the franchise. This saga had uppers and downers for the last 13 years, which Bryan Singer brought the genre into a new level, by making the first two films, that after him many others followed. Now, he's back by bringing an all-star cast into X-Men: Days of Future Past. So, is it a letdown or a success? It's definitely, the best X-Men film till now. Singer is the father of this franchise and he makes one of Marvel's best projects. One of the biggest concerns of the film since the begging of the production was the oversize of the cast. There is this great balance of use for every character in the story, which you don't even care that most of them don't have much dialog. But the main heroes of the story are Wolverine, Professor X, Magneto and Mystic. Hugh Jackman once more plays the tough Wolverine, in probably in his best show run and he constantly reminds you why you love him in this role. Also, one of my favorite elements in First Class, which is the relationship between McAvoy's Xavier and Fassbender's Magneto, is here and in a more hostile environment. Jennifer Lawrence's Mystic was one of the main parts in the film, and the way her character was made for the development of the film was one of the smartest elements. But the film is based on the theme of Hope, which is connecting with Charles Xavier, who from James McAvoy's broken Xavier evolves to the mentor and leader Patrick Stewart's Professor X. McAvoy gives an astonishing performance which provides you most of the most dramatic moments of the film. Meanwhile, the biggest surprise is Quicksilver. He is the most entertaining part of the project and his scene in the Kitchen gets in main highlights and shows us the most interesting and awesome use of super speed. Without giving spoilers, this film is the redemption for every mistake that the previous installment had made. In verdict, Days of Future Past is an emotional action journey to the best X-Men film ever made, which gives the opportunity to an ever bigger Future for this amazing franchise. With this and Captain America The Winter Soldier, 2014 has become my favorite year for super heroes and being an even bigger fan for Marvel; next stop Guardians of the Galaxy, but it would be very difficult to surpass those two."
"opensorce69","10","1","2","24 May 2014"," Simply the best X-Men movie ever...
","Brilliantly written, acted and directed. Simply put this movie was everything you'd want it to be and more. The cast, both older and more recent played their parts to the hilt. Cameos were done without seeming intentional or silly. The direction was top notch. Exactly what should have been in X3 and FC. The story was so well written that the time travel aspects that should have been a bit difficult to swallow seemed natural.<br/><br/>And... at long last, the continuity of the X-Men movie universe is whole once again. If I had one regret it's that they didn't find a place for Liev Schreiber to make an appearance in the future."
"summerehca","10","1","2","24 May 2014"," Brilliant!!
","I have never watched any of the X-Men movies in the big screen in the past. This was my first, and risked to watch in 3D, not knowing what to expect. Hell yeah, if I wished I had more popcorn in Godzilla to fight yawning, this time I totally forgot I had one. James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, Michael Fassbender, Jenn Lawrence, Ellen Paige , Peter Dinklage and Patrick Stewart were believable in their characters. Not too far behind were the supporting cast, esp Booboo :). Hugh was just Wolverine and that's enough for me. The sentinels were excellent made, esp the modern ones. The early models were just alright, in consideration with the year it was made. The time jump sequences were very fluid. Not one bit did I come up with a question, why or how. It even linked the behaviors and plot in the past. The story was narrated flawlessly, with impressive acting. <br/><br/>The effects were excellent. The fights and action scenes were perfectly placed. The script also revealed wit (esp with Peter/Quicksilver, the theater was just so loud with that one :D )<br/><br/>Kids will also enjoy this as there's not a lot of gory blood or profanities. Just make sure to explain to them Wolverine's backside lol. <br/><br/>The values were also on point. The morals were expressed in a way where one can relate, without sounding cheesy.<br/><br/>PLEASE WATCH IT!!! THE FILM AND THE ACTORS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DIRECTOR'S LEGAL CONCERNS. JUST WATCH THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT IS A BRILLIANT MOVIE.<br/><br/>Next HTTYD 2 and T4AOE"
"Dragonsouls","9","1","2","24 May 2014"," Cinematic brilliance
","Days of Future Past is by far, the best of the X-Men films. I can't recall when a film franchise managed to weave in the past and the present like this before, and even though the writers tried hard to throw in tidbits of info for the sake of continuity, but I can't help but applaud Brian Singer for putting it together in such a seamless manner. Expect to see some cameos too! <br/><br/>This is Brian Singer's most beautiful film, and I'm not biting back any words when I say that it truly is a brilliant piece of film-making. The camera-work, the lighting, the vantage points, the use of Slow-Mo, the blur effects during the Charles meets Charles scene...it was just so masterfully done and unexpected. There were some instants where the action was shown from the perspective of old 1970s grainy TV footage, and it seemed as if we were watching real, historical, archived footage that was locked away in some CIA vault! <br/><br/>The main cast, as expected was nothing short of brilliant--and I'd like to start with Micheal Fassbander. He stole the show in my opinion, and I also thought McAvoy, and Lawrence had some Oscar worthy, tear-jerking scenes. Besides the fantastic acting by this young, talented trio, they also had the some of the coolest action scenes. There was an airport scene in the film that featured Mystique and McAvoy, and I thought it was amazing--both on an artistic and technical level. I thought Magneto's superpowers were really stretched to a whole knew level in this film, such as the scene where he was disarmed and still fired the gun as it fell...so creative! However, the single best action scene belonged to the character Quicksilver. His scene was absolutely beautifully shot and should be shown in film schools!<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, they all put in solid efforts. Hugh Jackman made for a good wise-cracker as usual, Stewart and McKellan had their moments, however brief they might have been. I really would have liked to see more Dinklage in this film, and I thought Peter Dinklage did such a fine job at playing a scientist that was deeply concerned with Homeland security. However, his screen-time was sadly limited.<br/><br/>Other than that, I really have nothing negative to say about this excellent film, except that it may require multiple viewings for some people who aren't accustomed to Time Travel based science fiction. I myself, am a die-hard Star Trek fan, and so I had no trouble with the complex plot. Just hearing Patrick Stewart say the words-- ""We must go back in time"" was worth the price of admission alone, and I can honestly say that this is one of the top 3 best superhero films ever made!"
"stevendbeard","9","1","2","23 May 2014"," The Best X-Men Movie in the Series
","I saw ""X-Men:Days of Future Past"", starring Hugh Jackman-Real Steel, Swordfish; James McAvoy-Wanted, Band of Brothers_t.v., Michael Fassbender-The Counselor, Jonah Hex; Jennifer Lawrence-Katniss in the Hunger Games movies, Winter's Bone and Peter Dinklage-Game of Thrones_t.v., Death at a Funeral.<br/><br/>This is based on a comic book storyline from the X-Men comic books from somewhere around 1981. It's directed by Bryan Singer-he directed the first two X-Men movies-and I think this film is the best one in the series. It combines both the older and the newer characters by using time travel. The story starts off in the not too distant future, where Sentinels- mutant hunting robots-are eliminating any and all mutants wherever they can find them. The surviving X-Men come up with a plan to send Hugh-Wolverine-into the past, to prevent the building of the Sentinels. It seems that Hugh is the only X-Man that could survive the trip, what with his unique healing factor. Peter-Bolivar Trask-creates the mutant hunting robots in 1973 and Jennifer-Mystique- assassinates him, which causes the speedy production of the Sentinels. Hugh has to jump back in time, get the younger versions of James-Charles Xavier-and Michael-Magneto-to help him find Jennifer and then stop her, before the Sentinels kill the last mutants in the bleak future. There are several new mutants to keep an eye on; Warpath, Blink and Quicksilver are a few and Quicksilver is a real scene stealer. There is also a scene after the end credits which sets up the next X-Men movie; it shows a brief glimpse of the next villain and his name starts with an ""A"". It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 11 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"drew_atreides","8","1","2","23 May 2014"," Among the best of the X-men movies..
","...seeing Bryan Singer back here REALLY makes you wonder what kind of movie he might've been able to craft out of X-Men 3..<br/><br/>It is so nice to have him back at the helm of this franchise. In my mind X-Men 2 and X-Men: First Class are neck and neck as the best entries in the franchise, and i'm happy to report that Days of Future Past manages a happy medium between these 2, and propels itself into that same tier.<br/><br/>The film has a pretty tight script for a subject that is so complicated. It handles the back and forth through time quite well.<br/><br/>Above all else it's the cast and characters that make this movie work. Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Hugh Jackman and Jennifer Lawrence carry the majority of the load here, and they are all in fine form. <br/><br/>Of course you have living legends in Ian Mackellen and Patrick Stewart who never disappoint, and finally you've got Peter Dinklage who is another class act, new to this series. <br/><br/>I do miss the musical score from First Class, but otherwise this is an incredibly solid entry in the pantheon of comicbook cinema. Can't wait for the next one!"
"Tehmeh","9","1","2","23 May 2014"," This shouldn't work, but it does.
","Before I begin, I'll say this: It's recommended that you're familiar with other X-men movies (I'd say X2, the disappointing X3, First Class and The Wolverine or at least its mid-credits stinger) to fully appreciate this one. It's not necessary in order to understand the movie, but it certainly helps.<br/><br/>""Days of future past"" is packed with story and characters. It moves quickly from one scenario to another without giving us much breathing time. You don't get to ""dwell"" in certain situations/revelations enough and about 15 more minutes to its runtime would've been welcome. Some things weren't explained that I hoped, and some elements seemed too much like cheapish plot devices in contrast to everything else that worked so well.<br/><br/>Those were my only gripes, and almost all of them don't matter that much in the end, because the movie convinced me that ""It's OK, we got this"". This movie took my hand and steadily led me through the story. Even when something didn't please me or disappointed me a little, something else quickly came along and hid the annoyances under a rug, allowing me to stay in the movie. <br/><br/>The time travel aspect is easy to grasp. You won't (and shouldn't) think about it too much to pick it apart. It works in its simplicity, and while it is a major piece of the story plot-wise, the main focus is on the 1970's characters and the drama. Don't get me wrong, this IS an action film, but the characters are a little deeper than what we usually get from movies of this genre.<br/><br/>All the main actors do a great job. Jackman is in his best form, McAvoy steals the central character arc, Fassbender is always enjoyable and Stewart/McKellen of course are full of charisma. Jennifer Lawrence (whose role is pivotal) didn't impress me in First Class, but now I'm a little more convinced. Nicholas Hoult is a likable presence. Trask's character is one we don't get to study deeply, but Dinklage is solid as usual. Some characters don't get much screen time (Ellen Page and BingBing Fan were really good, both for different reasons) and that's surely a problem for many, but in terms of the story every character worked. The surprise here is Evan Peters, in a positive sense.<br/><br/>For a fast-paced movie with much to show and tell, the pacing was as good as it could've been. Action, humor, wit, dialogue, some character arcs and drama were handled very well, and in a manner we don't usually see. The narrative is present at all times, even during most action sequences. The structure of this film feels refreshing. It's not something you've seen a hundred times before, and it's almost as if they went with their own pattern instead of following some other established formulas.<br/><br/>Normally shoving things that are meant to evoke every emotional response possible into one movie just doesn't work and makes it hard to define a tone. ""Days of future past"" handles it with ease. When things are serious, you're convinced. Whenever there's a conflict or a fight, you're excited. When it's funny, it's naturally funny instead of forcing a joke on you. Every little tonal shift feels natural. This film shouldn't work, but it works amazingly well. It reminded me of ""Silver linings playbook"" which also was a film that is quite messy as a concept, but the execution made it into something rare and memorable. <br/><br/>Directing is great and Singer's touches are there to be seen. Even with some epic action stuff, Singer keeps things ""contained"" in an intimate manner that's inventive, intense and works in favor of the movie. No blowing up half the city for no reason here, no unnecessary assaults on your senses. There's enough of intense conversational drama to make you care about said action, not to mention the characters themselves. This movie feels like X2+First Class combined and on steroids. <br/><br/>Technically ""Days of future past"" is pure quality. Cinematography is beautiful, as are all the special effects. The art and craft of cinema is well represented in many ways. Ottman's music is as good as it's ever been. Absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>With a little longer runtime and a little more focus, ""X-men: days of future past"" would've been a 10/10 for me. That said, this movie doesn't feel broke, sloppy or unfinished. It's surprisingly solid for a movie this packed, and in the end I was thoroughly rewarded. How many times after seeing a movie you felt like you were cheated, that you didn't get a fitting ending? This one manages to reward you and tease you at the same time.<br/><br/>I loved this movie and was genuinely impressed and moved. DOFP rises alongside X2 as the most satisfactory X-men movie for me. While X2 is a little tighter purely as a construct, DOFP just might be the most enjoyable one. As a story with plenty of emotional weight, nice touches, love for its own characters and plenty of fan service, DOFP is a really wonderful achievement. <br/><br/>So thank you, Bryan Singer. You finally got your ""X3"". Also thank you, Simon Kinberg. You proved something with this movie. Hopefully you keep it up, don't let this be just a happy accident."
"agha-hashim","8","1","2","23 May 2014"," The BEST of the X men series !!!
","This latest installment in the X men series is by the far the greatest and in my humble opinion the most entertaining superhero flick since the batman. DOFP although not a reboot, brings a breath of fresh air into the franchise and presents a film that everyone can enjoy, fan and non-fan alike.<br/><br/>If you've seen the last 6 movies, you'll notice a drastic difference i.e compared to the previous titles this movie has a very dark tone but it fits well with the story and the alarming situation the characters are caught up in.<br/><br/>DOFP lives up to the hype and then some;interestingly, its more about the story and less about the action (mind you it has enough to get anyone by).Jackman and James have great chemistry, the only let down for me personally was that the other characters had very small roles(enter Storm). <br/><br/>Much to many peoples delight, this movie corrects some of the 'wrongs' seen in the previous films specifically 'The Last Stand'. I was wondering how they would go about it and Days of Future past couldn't have been a better way to retell those stories and let it fit perfectly within the time line of the X universe.<br/><br/>This film is WORTH every penny and will lead you craving for more, the good news is 'X men Apocalypse' will soon be upon us."

","X-Men: Days of Future Past﻿ - Bryan Singer﻿ is back and how! Finally after 3 disappointing movies (with the exception of X-Men: First Class﻿ which was awesome) we finally get one which is as good as (or perhaps better than) the first two. Every scene was memorable. There wasn't a single boring moment. Thanks to Hugh Jackman﻿, James McAvoy﻿, Nicholas Hoult﻿, Michael Fassbender﻿ and of course Jennifer Lawrence﻿. They were all amazing in their own roles. Special mention must be made of Evan Peters﻿. No matter how weird the costume looks, his take on Quicksilver was awesome. Not only was his prison break scene one of the coolest slo-mo scenes we've ever witnessed but one of the best scenes in the entire franchise. But yes, the future scenes could've been a little longer. The little details here and there throughout the movie were really good. And of course, Peter Dinklage was really good. The 'future' scenes weren't that long, but the Sentinels were kickass. All in all it was arguably the best movie of the franchise. Now that Singer is back, and X-Men: The Last Stand﻿ is *SPOILER* gone, hopes are sky high for X-Men: Apocalypse﻿.<br/><br/>P.S.

","Like most X-Men fans, my support of the X-Men franchise has always been rocky for a number of reasons but I won't get into that because those explanations have been exhausted through the years. But, I've always remained optimistic and First Class and The Wolverine are the main reasons why I was excited to see this film because I had almost given up and I'm glad I didn't. DOFP is everything it was supposed to be, although it lacks in areas, the overall result was an amazing experience from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The Bad: I understand why they focused more on the 70s era but I wish we saw more of the dystopian future. I wanted to at least see some character interaction between all the X-Men in the future. All of the characters served their purpose enough for me to want to see more, but I mean we could have at least gotten some more dialogue between them all. I've come to the conclusion that Storm will never get her just do. I have many questions about where the franchise will go but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing it just means that I am anxious to see more movies. Too many characters are introduced just for show, but what can you do. *sigh*<br/><br/>The Good: The time travel element is not confusing at all. The script is solid and there aren't any cheesy scenes or bad dialogue. Visual effects are amazing. Seeing everyone use their powers and how they work together was totally fun to watch. It was great seeing how Charles becomes Professor X. James McAvoy's performance was so compelling. Opening sequence was on the same caliber as the opening sequence in X2 with Nightcrawler. Everyone's performance and it was nice to see that Wolverine wasn't the main focal point. The Sentinels are scary as hell and everything just builds to be great. <br/><br/>I'm not sure how to really reviews this film without giving spoilers, but you can tell that Bryan Singer and Simon Kinberg really took their time in structuring a well crafted movie. It combines science fiction and action with depth and emotion very well and that's what I think a comic book movie should be about.<br/><br/>My faith in the franchise has been restored and all the ester eggs moments and possibilities they can do with the franchise makes me very excited for what's coming next. I just have to say that after X-Men: Apocalypse, I don't want to see anymore origin movies. I want to see a full on X- Men movie. Avengers managed to give us an amazing spectacle of what a team up battle should look like. DOFP delivered but the climax is nowhere near as Epic as Avengers was but I'm fine with that because DOFP did it's job and I'm ready for more.<br/><br/>This is definitely the best X-Men movie of he franchise."
"ryanhartley1992","9","1","2","23 May 2014"," From Geek to Geek!
","Before i start my review i would first like to tell you that i am proudly a long time fan of the Marvel universe and deep lover of the comic book universes it has created. When i watched the original trilogy i enjoyed them but was disappointed feeling they lacked a certain something, and after the devastation of the disaster that was 'The last stand' i had thought it would be a long time before professor Xavier and his X-men returned. Thank the universe i was wrong.<br/><br/>When First class hit the cinemas it was like a breath of fresh air had revitalized the stagnant body of the franchise, everything i had wanted it to be it was. We were shown superb acting and cinematography, a beautifully written plot and there was a constant sense of energy and drive. And most of all it made me think and reflect and lose myself in my imagination and thoughts. First class had me pining for more.<br/><br/>So it was that i saw 'Days of future past' as soon as it was in my local cinema. I don't know where any of the two hours and ten minutes went, i was hooked from start to finish and so engrossed that time sped past. 'Days of future past' takes us on a tremendous journey from the bleak reaches of the future back into the past. We see X-men from both the old and new franchises face their toughest battles and some of their most defining moments. The wonderfully crafted script makes for a seamless smooth ride despite the cuts between past and present and even gives tasty titbits in a nod to other x-men story lines. The characters are better than ever and the sheer acting power behind them drives them forward to greater heights. I must in particular tip my hat to James Mcavoy and Jennifer Lawrence. Despite the dark brooding storyline which X-men fans will already have an idea of there is still plenty of laughs to be had. A certain scene with speedster Quicksilver is in my opinion the funniest and coolest scene in all X-men films. A nod to young peter evans who we will be seeing more of in the next film i am certain.<br/><br/>Without giving away too much you can be assured that 'Days of future past' will have you ensnared in your seat, leave you stunned, laughing and maybe even have you deep in thought by the end. If that's not enough to convince you of this films brilliance than i shall say but one last thing, All wrongs of the past are righted, all things become full circle."
"PyroSikTh","8","1","2","23 May 2014"," The Perfect Marriage of Two Continuities
","Days of Future Past is a brilliant amalgamation of both eras of the X-Men franchise. After Origins and First Class, it was presumed we'd never see the traditional cast set in the modern day again. Then Wolverine came along set almost ten years after the events of Last Stand, and it also teased Days of Future Past with Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen appearing in the post-credits scene. Days of Future Past, in that respect, feels like having your cake and eating it too. It's a direct sequel to two completely different movies in the franchise, containing the casts of both eras, and using the perfect source material to do so. It ties everything together really nicely by default of having all these actors together.<br/><br/>However, while it does tie the two strands together, it also takes gross liberties with continuity. If you watch all seven movies in release order, you'll start to notice a number of things don't add up. The most crucial is, after Last Stand, how are Xavier and Magneto alive and fully operational? Xavier died, and Magneto lost his powers, but they're quite obviously around and kicking twenty years later. Obviously there are explanations. The end of Last Stand hints at Magneto's powers returning, and Xavier mentioned transporting his conscious to another body, however none of these are even mentioned in Days of Future Past. You're expected just to go along with it. Another fairly crucial bit of continuity is Wolverine's claws. Obviously in 1973 they're not coated in adamantium, while in 2023 they are. Problem with this is that Wolverine lost the adamantium coating at the end of Wolverine, which is set in the present day. It's hard to believe Wolverine would willingly get his claws re-coated in the ten years between. There's a number of other little niggles, but they're honestly not worth pointing out.<br/><br/>Balancing that out, however, are a number of great nods to previous events. Obviously a lot is carried over from First Class as it picks up on Magneto, Xavier, and Beast almost ten years later. For me, the greatest nod to the running plot of the franchise, however, is that of Wolverine's origin. I mean when you really think about it, Origins is pretty much redacted, but I think almost everyone did that in their heads already, so it's no loss. The running plot of Wolverine's turmoil is touched on once again here as he finds himself face-to-face with a young William Stryker. This emotional jarring has some pretty huge ramifications on the story, which is great, and it's picked up again at the end to explain how he's still got adamantium grafted to his bones.<br/><br/>The story itself is pretty great, although I can't say it's without it's holes (the most crucial of which I've already mentioned). Being a time-travel story, it will always take a number of watches and some thinking through to really connect all the dots and make sure everything works, but with Days of Future Past, it doesn't even matter. The wider continuity has little to no effect on the story the movie wants to tell. There are nods here and there, but you can tell they just wanted to tell a good X-Men story without having to worry about everything, and they did. There's some great character work here, with Xavier at his lowest point, Magneto slipping into his villainous persona we all know, Mystique's struggle of choice over destiny, and Wolverine's past constantly coming back to him. It's also pretty unpredictable. Once we entered the third act I just thought to myself; 'I know we're nearing the end, but I don't have a clue how they're going to solve this.' But what I liked most was how the future glimpse wasn't merely used a bookend, but it's revisited a number of times throughout, ramping up the tension and raising the stakes even higher than they already were.<br/><br/>The visuals were pretty great, as were the action scenes themselves. The post-apocalyptic future that needs to be avoided is bleak. New York City is in ruins, and everywhere is patrolled by these nigh-invincible Sentinels (that actually look a lot like the Destroyer in Thor). Beyond the landscapes and sentinels, the effects work here is pretty great too. It all looks quite obviously futuristic with bizarre flying carriers for the sentinels and holographic gadgets, but also the mutant abilities are rendered really well. Colossus and Iceman of course turn their skin into another material, but there's other's like Blink's portals and Bishops...ability, whatever the hell that was. There's also a great scene with Quicksilver taking on a whole room of guards in his own sweet time, and having a load of fun with it; moving the guards so they punch themselves, or trip over nothing, moving the bullets so they miss their targets, all the while listening to some pretty at-odds music. <br/><br/>Days of Future Past isn't the best film, it's not the best superhero film, hell it's not even the best X-Men film (although on that last one, it's not far off), but it's a thoroughly enjoyable romp nonetheless. If nothing else, it's an excuse to see Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen together once again. It's the perfect way to tie together the franchise's separate continuities and give us fans the best of both worlds. There's also a cheeky post-credits scene, so make sure you stay for that. We were literally the only ones waiting for it (amateurs), and while it probably means more to those who read the comics, it implies some pretty monumental things to come in Age of Apocalypse. I give Days of Future Past a very good 8/10.<br/><br/>http://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/"
"YJLcool","9","1","2","23 May 2014"," A brilliant sequel to First Class and the original film trilogy
","The X-Men film series has been ""hit-and-miss"" throughout the years, from the successful 2000's X-Men and 2003's X-Men United, the mediocre and pointless standalone Wolverine films (2009 and 2013), to the terrible Last Stand (2006) and the excellent First Class prequel (2011). It's been 14 years long since Bryan Singer directed the first X-Men film that kickstarted the whole franchise. This time around, he's back directing the franchise's 7th installment (His third X-Men film), Days of Future Past.<br/><br/>Loosely adapted from the 1981 Chris Claremont and John Byrne comic storyline of the same name, Days of Future Past intends to bridge the gap between the original trilogy of films and First Class, melding together the disjointed history of the X-Men world, erasing or fixing certain plot holes, continuity errors and inconsistencies that exist in the franchise, start anew and open up possibilities for future films. With that being said, this is considered the most epic and ambitious taking of the X-Men films to date.<br/><br/>Days of Future Past fulfills its long-term promises and achieve the 'impossible'. This film wouldn't work without a solid foundation laid over throughout the years. We have known some of these characters for so long (4 films, 2 spin-offs) that we can identify with them strongly. Fans would definitely be pleased with the numerous cameo appearances of Marvel characters in the film as well.<br/><br/>Because the film involves time travel (a story that jumps back and forth between 2023 and 1973), it is intensely plot-driven, linking the events that happened in past films together with historical events as part of the story. The film has decent pacing and story flow, successfully integrating both future and past timelines together, avoiding many of the typical time paradoxes without overcomplicating the story.<br/><br/>The film takes the best thing about the X-Men and show it to the audience: taking all of these 'gifted' individuals and make them into a team, watch how they face and solve issues inherent to teamwork. Forget The Avengers. This film has two generation of mutants from two different timelines (14 of them) teaming up to prevent an apocalyptic future that could mean the extinction of both mutants and humans.<br/><br/>Finally at last, Marvel fans get to see how these individuals complement one another in terms of power, weakness and personality by teaming up to fight against an army of mutant-hunting, lethal Sentinels. There's also one amazing action sequence involving Quicksilver, which is probably one of the film's highlights. The way he infiltrates and stages the prison break from a highly-secured Pentagon cell is simply brilliant. Not to mention, the song that comes with the scene is spot-on as well.<br/><br/>While many would have thought this film is overcrowded with characters, but this is not the case. The film cleverly focuses on young Xavier's character arc, which acts as the central story that ties the various subplots together into a single narrative, watching him go from a guy who lost nearly everything...his legs, his best friend, his adopted sister, his students due to the Vietnam War (his school as well) to a guy who will become the powerful, wise, compassionate teacher and leader of the X-Men in the future. There's a wonderfully shot, exceptionally acted, heartfelt moment in the film...the conversation between the young and old Xavier. ""Please...We need you to hope again..."" pleads the older and wiser Xavier, with emotional heft and gravitas to his broken and disheartened younger self.<br/><br/>However, the franchise has yet to provide a compelling villain that poses a huge threat to the X-Men. The series have always been repeatedly dwelling with themes of discrimination, prejudice and social injustice...with the human race always in conflict with the mutants. (This will soon change in the next sequel) There's another gripe regarding the CGI effects presented in the film. Some of the shots aren't realistic enough and shown to be rather sloppy, which is definitely not expected from a high-budget Hollywood blockbuster film. Overall, this latest instalment of X-Men film series have left me incredibly hopeful for the upcoming sequel, X-Men: Apocalypse. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/05/movie-review-x-men-days-of-future- past.html<br/><br/>Note: As usual with many Marvel films, please stay for the after-credits scene."
"georgecoffeynewyorker","9","1","2","23 May 2014"," COmical, KEEP an eye on the screen otherwise you're lost
","I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The Wolverine character(Jackman), provided the best of laughs. My babe Lucas Hill(Actor name - not sure of the character name in the film) was special as always is. heeheh. The plot from what I could gather Wolverine was sent back in time from the future by Charles(Stewart). Now the film did go backwards and forwards from the future to the past and the past to the future etc., You had to keep you're eye on the screen. NO Question of it. I was most impressed with the action by Fassbenders character Magneto. But the cleptomaniac character towards the begging, Maximoff who by the is very cute provided great laughs and comical aspects of the film. The film continues to realise the audience that Mystique was wanting to kill Trask for a reason of which I don't have too much memory of. Trask is a company owned by Bolivar Trask(The small guy). <br/><br/>Bottommline, film most enjoyable, comical, BUT keep an eye on the screen. If you look away, you've lost the plot to the film. I was able to keep any eye on the characters etc.,"

I am more than done seeing this brilliant film. (google translate, sorry but IMDb doesn't accept Spanish)"
"ascott12391","10","1","2","22 May 2014"," Bes X-Men Yet
","This is my first review for the site, and what a movie to start with. Now, as a kid I was a giant comic book nerd. Only thing was, I was only into Spiderman. Because of this I have very little experience with the X-Men comics. Because of this movie, that will soon change. My friend whom I saw this with, informed me that this was very close to the comics however. Now, this movie starts in a future (obviously) where things have gone wrong. Mutants, mutant sympathizers, and parents of future mutants, and being hunted down and killed preemptively in a cross between Minority Report and 1984. In order to stop this, the mutants decide to send Wolverine's consciousness back to 1973 in order to convince Professor X and Magneto to stop an assassination of a wealthy weapons manufacturer. This is a very deep story however, as it goes into the mind of Professor X as not only his school and best friend are ripped from him, but also the love of his life. It's almost painful to watch this wise old Obi-Wan figure turning to drug abuse just to stay sane. Wolverine does play a huge part in this movie, but don't worry. He may be the main character, but he doesn't overshadow anyone at all. In fact, the other characters almost overshadow him instead. In true X-Men movie fashion, there are deaths, and they are brutal. There were also quite a few scenes that made me flinch, and I'm saying that as someone who can gut a deer. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 13, but I can't speak for everyone out there. There is quite a bit of comic relief to balance out the painful parts though. One scene in particular which involves breaking into the Pentagon had everyone in the theater in tears they were laughing so hard. So it's not Dark Knight depressing I would recommend this for anyone who has enough willing suspension of disbelief that they can take comic book movies (because let's face it, they aren't even remotely possible). Anyone else would probably be better off watching something boring while we're having fun."
"jamesissuperawesome","10","1","2","22 May 2014"," I've never gotten chills like this.
","I am a massive fan of X-Men, and I was hyped for this movie. Hyped is probably and understatement, I was beyond excited, and my expectations were higher than you could imagine. Did X-Men: Days of Future Past meet those expectations? Yes.<br/><br/>When people talk about the best superhero movies, they always compare things like The Avengers and The Dark Knight, et cetera. Days of Future Past has set the bar very high and deserves to be talked about as much, if not more than those such as The Avengers and The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>This IS Bryan Singer's franchise, and he has truly made a magical piece of cinema this time around. The acting in this film is simply superb, whilst the action is pitch perfect, and the storytelling is on another level.<br/><br/>Go see this, I implore you to."
"khalidabusamra","10","1","2","22 May 2014"," Now *this* is how you make a summer movie...
","Another highlight is simply the tone and structure of the film as a whole. Singer injects quite a bit of humor, but not so much as to detract from the drama, and at the same time he never allows things to get too bleak either. There's some dark stuff (particularly in the future scenes) but ultimately this is a hopeful tale, with themes and a message that resonate without ever seeming forced upon us.<br/><br/>One of the most surprising things about DOFP is how simple the story actually is. Once you wrap your head around the time travel stuff (holes can be poked if you think about it too much..like ANY movie using that plot device) it basically boils down to a battle for the soul of Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), with Xavier (James McCavoy) as the angel on one shoulder, and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) as the devil on the other. See, it was actually something Mystique did in in 1973 which led to the hellish future we find ourselves in at the start of the movie, so Professor X (Patrick Stewart) thinks that if Logan (Hugh Jackman) can prevent her from carrying out the deed, that the unstoppable Sentinels won't be created and that future will be averted. Logan enlists the help of the younger versions of Xavier, Beast (Nicholas Hoult), and Magneto - - but unfortunately for all concerned, the ever devious Mr. Lensherr has his own agenda.<br/><br/>The X-Men have endured for so long for good reason. I love most of the Marvel flicks (not trying to start a flame war, just using them as an example) but they're not really known for dealing in shades of grey when it comes to their characters, and they're simply less interesting as a result. Here our main protagonists are a noble, but ruthless killing machine and (at least in this movie) a snarky, apathetic junky. Then there's Mystique, who still clings on to her humanity but is willing to let it slip away in her pursuit of justice. And Magneto; not an inherently evil man, but a man prepared to commit evil acts to ensure the survival of his race. Not exactly The Avengers.<br/><br/>Over all it's a ""AMAZING"" summer movie! 9.5/10 & Wait for the credit scene at the end of the movie, If you haven't seen the movie or didn't stick around, here's what it shows. The camera starts in a desert and closes in on a hooded figure standing on a giant sand dune, facing away from us. Crowds of hundreds bow to him below, chanting ""En Sabah Nur."" As he raises his hands a giant pyramid begins to assemble in the air overhead. The camera pans around the figure to reveal his pale face and blue lips, as well as four horsemen standing on a hill in the distance. (I couldn't quite make out the actor during his brief appearance, but he strongly resembles Aaron Taylor-Johnson, which could be a little confusing: Taylor-Johnson already appeared playing Quicksilver in Captain America: Winter Soldier's post-credits teaser for the next Avengers.) Here's what it means. ""En Sabah Nur"" is the Egyptian name of one of X-Men fans' favorite villains, Apocalypse. In the comics, Apocalypse grew up in ancient Egypt and has grey skin and blue lips. Typically, he is accompanied by four horsemen, loosely modeled after the Biblical Four Horseman of the Apocalypse. Once you know that the sequel to Days of Future Past is titled X-Men: Apocalypse, it doesn't seem hard to put two and two together."
"john310","1","3","12","4 June 2014"," Mr Singer should read comics
","I had very high hopes for this film but as any true comic book fan i hated it just because of all the nonsense this film had to produce .the story overall was quite good enough and the acting was excellent but a good movie needs a good story too.Mr Singer delivers a powerful and emotionally superior film but lacks in all the continuities.there are so many inconsistencies within the film that it mind boggled me throughout the film.just for the sake of correcting some previous mistakes by Fox he had to rewrite the story in his own image .the inconsistencies of the film are : 1.it was Shadowcat who was sent in the past to warn the others and not wolverine. 2.Rachael summers is the one who sends kitty back in the time by using her telekinetic/telepathic powers and not Shadowcat sending wolverine. 3.the reason the sentinel program is allowed due to the assassination of Senator Kelly and not Bolivar Trask who created the sentinels. 4.where were the sentinels throughout the X Men trilogy earlier produced by fox if they were created in the 70's era? 5.Magneto was never locked away in any prison and neither did he tried to save Mr.Kennedy 6.Clearly Mr singer cannot calculate age differences because magneto and quicksilver are not so much closer in age as shown in the film 7.all the extra mutants used in the film in future are nothing more than glorified cameos where as most of the mutants were already dead on the comics or kept in camps 8. Havok being the younger brother of cyclops should be born after cyclops and not before him . There are many other inconsistencies in the film which i may be missing but the above stated are enough to qualify"
"stansellb","7","2","7","22 June 2014"," Heh?
","I'm extremely conflicted about this movie since it seems to raise more questions than it purported to answer. It made an extravagant claim that it would connect the rebooted First Class with the original trilogy, however in my mind it has destroyed both. <br/><br/>Assuming the future in DoFP is 20-30 years from the end of The Wolverine, were Magneto and Prof. X just sitting on their asses after warning Logan, knowing this day would come? Where does Logan get adamantium to cover his claws again after The Wolverine (he slashes Kitty with metal, not bone claws)? Everyone thinks Prof. X should be the one to go back in time, but it's only after Kitty tells him he wouldn't survive the trip that Logan volunteers. Um... wouldn't both Prof. X and Logan know this already?? On top of that, the scene at the end of The Wolverine implies ""we all have our gifts"", implying it would be Prof. X sending Logan back. HE DOESN'T DO CRAP. Kitty's the one using her power. X just mind melds with Logan so he can talk to himself. Assuming DoFP never happened (no time travel), Trask develops and deploys sentinels in the 70's! That's 60 years before the future in DoFP! Seriously, no one knew this was coming? Shouldn't it have already come? After that presentation at the White house, did they just put the sentinels in storage for 40 years then start selling them at the end of The Wolverine (the 70's model is shown on the monitors at the airport where Logan encounters Magneto and the Professor)? Given her outrage at the experimentation on Mutants, why is Mystique/Raven imitating Stryker at the end? Does she want to be the one to give Logan adamantium? Does she just give him up to Stryker? WTF? And finally, does Magneto just... go good at the end? Foregoing the Brotherhood of Mutants and retiring in a country home? I mean, Phoenix in X3 apparently never occurs after Logan 'changes' history, and in the end, Phoenix was a consequence of Liberty Island, which was a consequence of the Brotherhood being in existence. And Jean's death at Logan's hand (claws) was a huge subplot of The Wolverine, which it looks like never happened in this new future. And let's just ignore the fact that the Sentinels in the Danger Room in X3 look nothing like the ones presented in DoFP (future or past) despite the fact they've known about them for almost 30-40 years at that point. <br/><br/>Sigh. I could go on and on with these circular questions, but they start to give one a headache. Which is my main problem with the film. I like it's style, direction, and I even think it had a good story to tell... but that is only if you ignore every other X-Men film. Which brings us to the paradox.<br/><br/>We as fans were led to believe that this film was going to concatenate First Class with the original trilogy, something that was even hinted at in The Wolverine (which I happen to think was the best X-Men movie, with X2 coming in a close second). None of them are perfect in terms of continuity, but I just can't help but I just can't help but think this was the worst. It's almost as if it occurred in a parallel universe. Like Fringe or something. <br/><br/>Edit: In my list of favorite X-Men films, I seem to have forgotten First Class, which I think was an excellent picture. I'd probably wedge it in between The Wolverine and X2. I just wish they had gone on with 'Second' Class or whatever they would have named it instead of the hodgepodge that is DoFP. Also, I forgot about X-Men: Origins... which I admit I never saw but heard it was awful... so I don't even consider it 'canon'.<br/><br/>Ignorance may very well be bliss in this case. I really wanted to like this movie; but then I started thinking. Que sera.<br/><br/>Edit: OK, Fox decided to release ""The Rouge Cut"" of this movie and I have to say the plot of this 'director's cut' is much more entertaining. Don't get me wrong, it's still full of holes that make little to no sense when compared with the rest of the franchises canon, but I think the added sequence of older Magneto saving Rogue makes up for it. Enjoyment still requires heads be in the sand but at least now I can find it enjoyable without persistently asking question after question."
"BA_Harrison","10","2","7","28 May 2014"," The best superhero movie yet? I still have a few to catch up on, but this looks like a serious contender.
","Having been suitably impressed by the trailers, I really wanted to check this one out on the big screen before it went to DVD, but was slightly concerned by the fact that I had yet to see X-Men: First Class. I needn't have worried: although many of the events in this latest adventure do refer to the previous movie, for the most part I found it fairly easy to fill in the blanks for myself, and am happy to report that I had an absolute blast with what has got to be one of the finest superhero films ever made.<br/><br/>An excellent cast, mind-blowing special effects, amazing direction by Bryan Singer, a fun time-twisting plot, Jennifer Lawrence in the buff (well, covered in blue paint and a few scales, but that's good enough for me!), the secret behind the assassination of JFK: X-Men: Days of Future Past is pure entertainment from start to spectacular finish. The 131 minutes just fly by.<br/><br/>Although the basic plot mightn't be considered all that fresh—it's the old 'change the past to alter the future' scenario—the whole thing is so beautifully written and skilfully executed that any lack of originality is easily forgiven. The entire cast do an excellent job, with special props going out to Peter Dinklage for his awesome Anchorman style hair-do and 'tache, and Evan Peters as Quicksilver, who provides the film with its most enjoyable moment, using his incredible lightning speed to save the other mutants whilst taking down an entire team of armed special agents."

","This takes place in the future. All mutants have been enslaved along with humans who tried to help them. Only a small team of the X-Men remain. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan) have an idea to send Wolverine (High Jackman) back into the 1970s to stop a killing from happening and change the future. They send him back but can he change things in time? <br/><br/>Next to ""The Final Stand"" this is easily the best X-Men movie ever. I wasn't going to see it because I hated ""X-Men: First Class"" but (technically) this isn't a sequel to that. It ties into that movie but also works with the first three movies. There are plenty of action sequences that are exciting with flawless special effects. It's sometimes however a little TOO violent--one character gets beheaded and another is torn apart. That's going a little too far. Also we're introduced early to a bunch of the X-Men who I didn't recognize...and their names (or powers) are never explained. This was a problem in a few of the earlier movies too. And James McAvoy was back as a young Professor X...and is terrible. All that aside however I loved this. The acting was good and there are many cameos from previous X-Men (it was great seeing Storm and Colossus again). Stewart, McKellan and Jackman easily hold the film together with their wonderful acting and Michael Fassbender is clearly enjoying himself as Megento. So a great film--well worth seeing."

But this is actually about the trinity of Xavier(McAvoy, and giving us a compelling portrayal, one who has lost hope this is his film, and the scene between him and Stewart is amazing), Magneto(Fassbender, dignified) and Mystique(Lawrence, showing us her immense range and she is the assassin that has to be stopped). This is where the laser-sharp focus comes from: All three are fiercely determined, bridge the gap between young and old(First Class, take notes), conflicted in what they feel they have to do, and using different approaches to solving the same problem: how will mutants be safe among humans who hate them and fear them? Especially given that this is a pivotal point<br/><br/>Singer is back, with a vengeance. Any frustration with him for his absence and the mess the series fell into after he left is almost instantly forgiven. He seamlessly fixes the plentiful problems, turning what once looked like insurmountable obstacles to retcon into stepping stones to new, gripping conflicts. This is a drama more than an action movie, with the latter derived organically from the former and not missed. It is never boring, and understands that the love of this half a century old franchise is not so much what these people can do, but who they are, and how they relate to one another. Everyone's powers are used well, and they aren't particularly written out, which was one of the bigger problems with the otherwise excellent first two pictures. The pacing is spot-on, giving us breathing room after emotions are driven through the roof, humor taking the sting out of the dark material, and at no point does it lose our interest or play its cards wrong. Every character is a human being, reacting based on their viewpoint, to the very real problem here. The xenophobia is dealt with well.<br/><br/>Almost everything here is amazing. The 2023 bits do tend to be a display case for fan-service(and yes, for what that is, it is squee-inducing), with everyone present not mentioned in the first paragraph of this existing there only to use the considerable strength of their abilities(no arc, barely any personality) and fairly inconsequential. It really doesn't help that the first fun portion of it literally turns out to be a fake-out. We don't return to it much, and it does give us something incredible, but it is overall the one weak point. And it's not that much of one. This sets a new standard for these, and, frankly, gives us something to rival the Marvel Studios outings, now that Nolan is no longer helming Batman. The FX are excellent. The stakes are set up immensely well right off the bat, with the large, humanoid robots known as Sentinels clearly an insurmountable threat that has to be stopped before it starts.<br/><br/>There is some deeply disturbing, brutal and violent(if not bloody) content in this, pushing to the edge of what PG-13 can get away with. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine liking it. 9/10"
"pamyou","8","3","14","27 May 2014"," Disillusioned
","I actually loved most of the movie - Until the very end - they decided to erase x-men 1-3 + the wolverine movies in a single stroke and I feel robbed. The fact that Jean Grey is alive just because they managed to kill the centurions, just doesn't make sense - Her powers are to intense to live with and Erik is still full of hate, wanting to kill of the humans, so even without the centurions everything that happened in the first movies should still have happened. Right now we're thinking did Wolverine get his claws - seeing that Mystic pulled him out off the river?? <br/><br/>So all in all being a x-men hardcore fan - I'm thinking what the F*** ???"
"Kidtastrophe","6","2","8","22 May 2014"," Plot Holes Galore but very good.
","Days of Future Past is a good film but you do have to ignore X-Men, X2, The Last Stand and The Wolverine in order to really enjoy it. I remember reading an interview with Bryan Singer stating that he wanted the time travel story line in order to clean up the continuity errors between all the films. This got me excited but he failed and DOFP just creates more questions than answers. The errors all stem from Kitty possessing the ability that allows the time travel, Professor X being alive and Logan having metal claws despite losing them in The Wolverine.<br/><br/>So ignoring the above you will be in for an enjoyable film. The action is well thought out, especially watching the original cast and storm in particular. I always felt she was under used but she finally gets a stage to show her power. The sentinels are great adversaries, I never knew how they would fit in but it actually makes sense and I think Fassbender's and Lawrence's performances are outstanding. The best part is probably the story line and ending. It gives the old cast a good send off and the new ones a platform on where to take the story as they can effectively introduce younger counter parts of storm and co to show how Xavier formed the X Men or go in a brand new directions such as Gambit who is already confirmed in the next film.<br/><br/>All in all I can't see many being disappointed. Just forget about the errors and watch it as a typical action film and you will feel like it was money well spent.<br/><br/>Oh and stay to the end of the credits for an extra scene. Again it brings more questions than answers but that seems to be normal in this movie."
"eragonbookfan","2","4","26","23 October 2014"," Stop making these movies!! Evolution is a fairy tale for grownups!!!
","(NOTE: I'm no troll - I've loved watching movies since I was little, I love acting, and likely start joining the acting business very soon.) The X-Men series may be the most overrated & over-hyped series of all time - and I don't think that statement is much of an exaggeration.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter what kind of cool action, special effects, or great acting there is in this queer sci-fi flick. A lot of talent, big Hollywood names (even a few annoying ones), and tons of money are wasted! All duped by a HUGE LIE (ie. Darwinian evolution) - making a story centered around that is one HECK of a mistake!<br/><br/>The fact is, evolution is NOT ""scientific""! It's a carefully protected state religion, surviving only on tax dollars! It has nothing to do with Science as much as beer has nothing to do with sports. Nobody should pay to have their children be lied to in school. By teaching kids there is no Creator & that we all came from primitives is the same as teaching the earth is flat! They're not getting ""educated"", but getting INDOCTRINATED! <br/><br/>Did you know, today they're calling us ""homo sapien sapien"" - the word ""sapien"" means ""wise"". So today, we're the wise, wise man! That's interesting. The Bible says, ""Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools."" Now if you believe your ancestors were a monkey, you're a fool.<br/><br/>And the Neanderthals were nothing more than perfectly normal , well-advanced in age, with diseases (ie. arthritis). But even those evidences like these have been proved wrong over 50 years ago, they STILL remain in the textbooks! And no doubt the creators and cast of this film have been DUPED by these lies! <br/><br/>Almost every single chance this film gets, evolution tries gets SHOVED at us, and it takes me out of this film - it's so bad that it OVERWHELMS the good stuff. Trust me that's really going to dumb a whole generation down. Evolution didn't launch us into space - it was rocket science! Nearly all branches of Science were created by biblical creationists (Isaac Newton, Werner Von Braun, Francis Bacon, Louis Pasteur, etc). Darwin was not a ""scientist"" - he was one of the greatest speculators of all time; he always made up stories when he was young! Like Hitler said, ""People are more likely to believe a BIG lie than a small one."" And plus, he looked like the saddest looking man I had ever seen in my life. Long story short, my advice is just go watch Dr. Kent Hovind's Science seminars on YouTube - one person can learn more ""Science"" from this guy than their whole life at school... sadly.<br/><br/>Also, mutations are only HARMFUL, and only cause suffering & death! They NEVER 'cause superpowers! Whoever thought of such a thing clearly have to get their head examined. And all the invented plot holes of people being ""racist"" or ""intolerant"" of ""mutants"" has gotten quite annoying! Trust me, in a godly Christian worldview, there would be love & acceptance all around.<br/><br/>Sadly, the big ""MARVEL"" guy himself, Stan Lee, is Jewish. I love Jewish people, they have turned out to be extremely smart & intelligent people; I've got a huge soft spot for them, because their history, their identity, their heritage, etc., everything about them is special. But there can be a lot of people born into this world with a God-given intelligence, but can use their intelligence the totally wrong way for the totally wrong things. (i.e. Stanley Kubrick, Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Richard Dawkins, etc.) I'm not saying, I ""hate"" Marvel. I LOVED the Avengers - a miracle of a film! I just dislike it when the religious unscientific theory of evolution is so horrendously tried to be shoved in our faces. You have to learn early in life to ""eat the meat & spit out the bones"" or you're'll to choke on something.<br/><br/>And the annoying cast members also really take me out of this film, as soon as they make their on-screen appearances. Ellen Page - quite possibly the worst actress since the ""rape victim"" in ""How To Kill a Mockingbird,"" and always acts dumb as a brick. Seriously, all the against from Gwyneth Paltrow should be re-directed at her instead! Miss Lawrence is WAY TOO over hyped & fails to play any character we can care about - and in the hopes will make us forget about hating her in being distracted by all the ""fan service"" she tries to give with her curvy bod. I have to say, when I saw the ""Hunger Games"", at first I thought she was the new Cate Blanchett. I was wrong, I passionately dislike her now; she shot herself in the foot. Patrick Stewart, no matter how ""cool"" a voice he has, really has been duped, and always talks about ""mutants"", when the actor himself is CLEARLY oblivious to the huge amount of lies, bias, fallacies, and falsified ""evidence"" it's based upon! Not to mention instead, the overwhelming evidence for special Creation, evidence of worldwide flooding on this planet, dinosaurs being the ""dragons"" throughout history & still being alive! (Same goes for Ian McKellen - though his LOTR films are better, since I can't see him as a villain!) And that goes for the REST of the cast members, especially the director of this film! They're all so sadly uninformed & uneducated in this huge vital area.<br/><br/>Our origins are not a ""side issue"" – they're vitally IMPORTANT! But to be fair, this story is decent on its own with no context.<br/><br/>And this film being set in a Buddhist monastery truly shows the immense bias Hollywood has against Christianity, & favoring Eastern religions.<br/><br/>PS: Am I the only one who thinks James McAvoy & Michael Fassbender (ugh) look NOTHING like their counterparts?? 1/10"
"Jackbv123","8","1","3","6 August 2017"," Strong presentation of good story
","Plenty of action to go with this non-stop story. Most of it is not predictable. Things seem to go from bad to worse for the future of mutants.<br/><br/>We are tempted to focus on James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, not to mention Hugh Jackman, but despite being fourth in the credits the center of the story is Jennifer Lawrence. She plays the pivot pin of the entire situation. Raven is a product of her past and Lawrence does a great job of showing her struggle to overcome it. Why is Lawrence fourth in the credits? <br/><br/>I recently saw Logan and can't help but make comparisons. Both have action and destruction right and left, but this movie manages to do it without the gore and mutilation. Logan has little substance in the plot, but this movie delivers an engaging plot. In this movie we have good acting from most if not all of the majors, while in Logan, all the performances were mailed in. The reason I compare the two is because Logan has a IMDb rating of 8.2 and this one, as I write, an 8.0. This movie is so much better, in all aspects."
"christopherdarveaux","10","1","3","7 July 2017"," Restores the X-Men series to what it was
","Having Bryan Singer back in charge clearly makes all the difference in the world. This man was born to make X-Men films. The first two X-Men movies were excellent, also done by Bryan Singer. X-Men: the last stand was an OK movie with some very bad logic flaws but the two wolverine films prior this were terrible in my opinion. The first thing this movie does right is it appears to disregard these completely. Because of X- Men: the last stand, Bryan Singer had his work cut out for him to undo all the logic flaws and I must say I was a bit skeptical after the epic fail of superman returns, but you can clearly see that Singer has done his homework and created a magical film with a lot of heart in the story and characters. <br/><br/>Without giving too much away, I will say that every scene is breathtaking. The story is a well-constructed piece of emotion and heart. <br/><br/>What really makes this film work is the complexity of the characters, especially Charles Xavier (professor X, both older and younger), Raven, and Magneto. What all these characters have in common is they are all tortured souls. As for Logan, well, Hugh Jackman is always fantastic, but the real star of the show is McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence. All of their characters help you to feel something for them. <br/><br/>This movie presents a time travel paradox, if you cannot look past that or are a viewer that prefers mainly non fiction, or cannot take sci fi leaps of faith, ignore this review. We'll both be better off.<br/><br/>See this film. It is probably the best superhero movie of the last decade. The only ones that are of the same caliber of superhero movies are Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. In some ways this film is even better. Rating: 10"
"ammovies","7","1","3","7 June 2017"," Consider this redemption for X-Men
","Not too long ago, I really thought X-Men went off the rails, especially after the last movie. I didn't really care for X-Men: First Class. However, after re-watching Days of Future Past on FXX, I think I was too harsh on the film when it was first released in theaters. If you think about it, it's basically the Terminator set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (YES I'm saying X-Men is apart of the cinematic universe because I'm sick to death of all those dumb asses who call themselves ""true Marvelites"" who are saying ""X-men isn't.""). That's the dumpy, pathetic moneymakers at Disney talking. Well, X-men is and always be Marvel's favorites, even as the years wear on. Without spoiling the entirety of the film itself, X-Men: Days of Future Past is a redemption mark for the entire X-Men franchise. Also, it was great to see Sir Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart working together!"

"MLDinTN","5","1","3","18 April 2015"," plot was too confusing
","I don't like sci-fi films when the plot gets too confusing and that was the case here. It starts out in present time, and the mutants are under attack from these human built robots, but by using time travel are able to warn there present selves when its time to leave a current location. Already sounds confusing.<br/><br/>Anyways, the mutants decide to take a last stand and want to prevent these robots from ever existing. So Logan is sent back in time to stop Raven from killing this guy Trask, whom is leading the research to build these robots. So Logan, must get Xavier, Magneto, and the Beast to believe him. And of course, once out, Magneto doesn't stay good for long. And they are trying to prevent all this from happening during the President's speech.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Too much stuff that happens this is hard to follow, it is so hard for a movie to do time travel right because there are so many what ifs. And I thought it just got lose in the convoluted plot. Definitely not as good as the first X-men movies."
"marccolten-1","3","1","3","12 April 2015"," Really Terrible Movie
","The really stupid part of the movie was that killing Trask makes things worse, but terrorizing the president and the military in full view of the world doesn't. So one mutant saved the president and Trask is defeated and is arrested for selling military secrets? What secrets do they have that he doesn't? His technology is 100 years ahead of the rest of the world (giant autonomous flying robots in 1973?). After what Magneto did they would kill every mutant and abort every fetus that could possibly be one.<br/><br/>If Mystique has her powers then and can even mimic Trask and break into his office why fly to Paris for a public assassination? Drown him in his bathtub - no guards, no air travel.<br/><br/>Better plan - if Magneto can command the 1973 Sentinels (never explained) have them suddenly go berserk at the demonstration like ED in Robocop and start killing everybody without an obvious mutant in charge. THEN Trask goes to prison and no one ever builds a Sentinel again."

"James_De_Bello","8","1","3","26 September 2014"," 8.5/10
","8.5/10 I saw this film on opening day and went back the day after to see it again. This really speaks to how much sophisticated entertainment Bryan Singer has managed to pull off. This is not the kind of soft fun you're having in an average blockbuster, the one you will most certainly forget very easily, yet it even isn't heavy or ""dark"" fun: it's a way in the middle. This is due to many, many ingredients: firstly on a performance level everybody is doing an amazing job. I think that the best Wolverine performance was in the film ""Wolverine"" but Hugh Jackman still is great an still remains my favourite superhero performance to date. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen could just be standing with the same face throughout the movie and I would still be in awe: it was great to see them back on screen together and they even had some magnificent character moments that they pulled off flawlessly: I'm hoping beyond hope to see them once again together because they fulfill their roles simply perfectly. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender aren't the legends their old counterparts are, but they are the best rightful substitutes we could have asked for (and Micheal Fassbender might actually become a legend sooner rather than later, he is on the right path for it). They have lots going on and thanks to a fantastic chemistry and talent, they do live up to their roles improving what we had seen in First Class. Jennifer Lawrence is immensely better as Mystique in this one and, taking her lesson from Rebecca Romain, gets her character to a better place where we left her, I am really interested now on where will she go, she won me over with this one. Peter Dinklage gives proof he is a special actor, bringing a very subtle and humble performance and without ever being showy he gets Trask to the perfect mix, even though the character was someway underused, Dinklage managed to give him relevance and presence. The rest of the cast is as good as you could ask, but most importantly they all get their chance to shine and we see some great references here and there. On this topic a shout out to Quicksilver has to be given: he has on of the best WTF scene I have ever seen. To this contributed perfect special effects that carry out across the board and I can safely say that even though this isn't a heavy Cgi movie (in a very positive way) every single visual effect was flawless and I never saw a shot that took me out of it. Bryan Singer demonstrates that he know this property very well and this proves in the directing. The screenplay is the richest and most complicated aspect of this movie: on a general aspect it is astonishingly deep and fluent, the fact is that it is striving to keep the movie going on whilst playing with the whole X-Men canon and to a comic book geek like me that is very important. On one hand it succeeds beyond expectations in tying up loose ends and respecting the majority of the canon yet on the other hand it sometimes feels a bit too artificial and doesn't give explanations to some minor devices that as the audience we are expected to pass (and we do because they are all great adjustments): why is Xavier alive? why does wolverine have metal claws back? why does Kitty make people travel in time? What exactly is the chronology for the future? I was more than happy about all of this but I would have appreciated them to give me an explanation and I will reiterate the fact that I was stunned at how brilliantly they managed to keep up-to-canon and how they ended it all. So before I enter into spoilers I will say I think this is another great entry in the comic book genre (X2 still remains my favourite x-men movie, but this one is right under it), where the movie really succeeds is in the characters and the portrayal of these iconic relationships and stories that bring in some breathtaking moments and some deep themes (to which the x-men have always been associated with), I do see myself rewatiching this over and over in the future and really hope it will get better with its sequels and with time, yet for now I must acknowledge a very fluent but sometimes uneven story (not plot!)."
"maxskyfan-9","9","1","3","27 September 2014"," This Movie Hit All the Pressure Points
","Plot<br/><br/>In the near future the government designs and manufactures hundreds of giant flying robots that are virtually unstoppable to the X-Men who are their intended targets. With the X-Men dropping like flies Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian Mckellen) advice a plan to reset time and wipe these murderous machines from existence. They theorize that they can send Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) consciences back in time to his younger self so he can fix the time-line to their advantage by removing one event from spiraling out of control. But even with certain doom being leveled on top of them the X-Men of the past are reluctant and even refusing to cooperate. Now it is up to Wolverine to make them listen as the future steadily approaches.<br/><br/>Character Development<br/><br/>Just like the acting this wasn't a film for giving room in the story for character development. All changes in behavior were mostly instantaneous. The story channels this as smoothly and easily as coming about in a sailboat and with as much planning and effort.<br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>Some moments shine better than others, but this isn't really an acting picture. It is more of a reacting picture, yet I give all the cast accolades for dodging obstacles and pretending that a world exists that isn't really there. Beyond the dazzle and spectacular brilliance that could describe most of this film there were the times that the acting leaped past the perfunctory, it is in those scenes which gave the acting some added weight, the scattered moments where the dialog lasted more than a minute and gave the time where a character could emote a feeling.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>As a new installment to the X-Men franchise this movie hit all the pressure points. The special effects were top notch and the story made a great deal of sense. Judging from the collective skill-sets that all the X-Men possess when they are working together there would need to be an antagonist that would be a powerful threat and I believe that the producers have pulled out all the stops to make that happen. I was genuinely impressed. It was also enjoyable to see how the story would tie the new and old X-Men together. I was reminded how the new and old cast members of Star Trek franchise were tie together for their one big film — 'Star Trek: Generations' (1994). I think this X-Men film tops that old next-generation film though. There were so many well moving parts in 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. The time travel aspect was quite creative. It was like the same device Christopher Reeve's character used in 'Somewhere in Time' (1980), by a means of projecting himself into the past by using the power of his mind. And who better to traverse the past than Wolverine, he seems to be the glue that hold the X-Men franchise together. No other character has been given two movies solely to themselves. He is in fact the bridge that connects both story lines. I hear this is just the start to a larger universe of X-Men to come and if so they have laid the foundation for a bright and fruitful future."

","When I originally saw this film, I saw it as a 10/10 film. It was the best X-Men film. Upon watching it again, what sticks out for me are the future sequences. I tried to approach the film, not as an avid lover of X-Men, but as someone who did not care for X-Men. <br/><br/>The beginning is okay as it starts in the future and has to get the film going. But as the film climaxes, the events in the future and the past are both coming to a climax. The future side is all action and it is unnecessary, because we know that somehow the plot will come to a resolution. And we know exactly how the future plot is going to end. <br/><br/>The past sequences are so tense that they did not need any tension at all in the future sequences. The future 2.0 should have just been left up to the main characters to form in the past sections as it proves difficult throughout the whole movie to do.<br/><br/>Everything about the past sequences is terrific. The acting, the drama, the tense action scenes, the story line, etc. Fassbender and McCavoy are once again the stand-outs in this film as they were in First Class.<br/><br/>I hope with the next X-Men film, the film will take place in the 80's and only the 80's."

","X-men: Days of Future Past is a movie depicting rivalry of humans and mutants. In this movie, X-men fights a war for the survival of mutants in two generations: future and past.

Professor X, Magneto, along with the mutant community try to save the lives of mutants from this threat. They send back Logan(Wolverine) into the past with help of Kitty Padre, a mutant having the ability to send a person's consciousness into the person's past, to change something that made the humans to develop Sentinels.

","I must admit that I wasn't familiar with the X-Men universe when I watched the first film back in 2008 and I was sceptical with the rest of the film series till I seen the X-Men: Days of Future Past trailer and it really caught my eye when the trailer was released back on the 29th of October 2013. I am a huge fan of Sir Patrick Stewart as well as Sir Ian McKellen and I promised myself that I wouldn't miss this film for anything! Also, the recurring theme of alienation in Bryan Singer's films also appeals to me as it reflects real life situations such as the Israeli-Palestinian issue as well as racism in today's society and discrimination in every aspect of society.<br/><br/>Basically, the plot of X-Men: Days of Future Past revolves round an apocalyptic future where robotic machines known as Sentinels have exterminated most of the mutant community as well as humans who carried the mutant gene. The Sentinels were created in response to the assassination of a military scientist back in the 1970's and they were created only for one purpose - mutant annihilation. However, the Sentinels also began to target humans who carried the mutant gene which lead to an apocalyptic world. The last remaining X-Men send Wolverine back to the past to prevent the assassination which will prevent the events of the apocalyptic future.<br/><br/>* I absolutely loved the relationships between Professor X and Magneto (both future and past). Brilliant acting by all four of the actors especially the interaction between Sir Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy.<br/><br/>* I really love film and TV quotes and the quotes in this film were magnificent :-<br/><br/>1) Charles Xavier: I don't want your suffering, I don't want your future!<br/><br/>2) Professor X: So many battles waged over the years... and yet, none like this. Are we destined to destroy each other, or can we change each other and unite? Is the future truly set?<br/><br/>3) Erik Lehnsherr: Angel, Azazel, Emma, Banshee. Mutant brothers and sisters, all dead! Countless others, experimented on! Butchered! Where were YOU, Charles? We were supposed to protect them! Where were you when your own people needed you? Hiding! You and Hank, pretending to be something you're not! You abandoned us ALL!<br/><br/>* The entire soundtrack for X-Men: Days of Future Past is AMAZING! The soundtracks are really touching especially when the Sentinels have released simultaneous energy blasts to the four remaining mutants. The music playing during the first trailer really got my attention and I have synced it to my phone because in my opinion, it is emotional and to be honest I am sort of a sentimental person who loves emotional themes. <br/><br/>* The link for X-Men: Days of Future Past Song trailer <br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVwP5WGXYM0<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with the adjustments made by Bryan Singer from the original films right up to X-Men: First Class. The events from the original films - X1, X2, X3, X-Men Origins: Wolverine - have been erased for the other characters BUT those events have still happened for Wolverine. I must admit that it took me a while to grasp the concept and it took me a while to decipher the scene between Wolverine and Professor X in the X Mansion as it was confusing at first, but I managed to understand it after watching that particular interaction over and over again.<br/><br/>Finally, I must admit that I am still not sure about X-Men: Apocalypse, but I will watch the film as it is being directed by Bryan Singer.<br/><br/>I thank the people who brought Bryan Singer back to direct this film. God Bless Hollywood and God Bless America! ♥"
"swellframe17","8","1","3","23 July 2014"," One of the best X-Men movies
","If you include the Wolverine films, there have been 6 X-Men movies. Bryan Singer's ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is the seventh film of this franchise and it is one of the best. It has everything you want in an X-Men movie, from cool new mutants and actions scenes to the blending of both the original X-Men cast and the ""X-Men: First Class"" cast. It may be a little crowded with all these character, but Singer does a good job of balancing them. <br/><br/>""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" focuses on Wolverine who is sent back to the 1970s after humans and mutants have almost become extinct by Sentinels. In the 1970s, Wolverine has to reunite a young Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) in order to stop the Sentinels from being created. <br/><br/>With a strong cast and action packed and witty script, Singer gives us a blockbuster ride that is just as fun as it is emotionally engaging. I grew up with the X-Men series so it was weird, but awesome, seeing all these characters I grew up with again and combining the great ""X- Men: First Class"" cast with them. There's a hilarious new mutant called Quicksilver (Evan Peters). He has a really good scene where he is running in a room to the song ""Time In A Bottle"" by Jim Croce.<br/><br/>""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is a great addition to the X-Men series. I know people will debate the time travel aspects of the story and how it stands with the comics. As a film-goer, though, I had a lot of fun watching this film and think it is one of the better sequels and comic book movies out right now. I don't think you'd be wasting your money seeing this film."
"birdsaw-442-457161","6","1","3","22 July 2014"," Quicksilver scene
","I found this installment of the X-Men entertaining and enjoyed the story. I watched X2 recently and noticed the Nightcrawler opening was similar to the Quicksilver scene. I did enjoy both scenes but couldn't help think that the Quicksilver scene was an extended version of the Nightcrawler scene from X2. I'm looking forward to the next installment, Apocalypse. <br/><br/>Wasn't too excited about the future Sentinels design, it looked way too CG so I'm hoping the next movie will incorporate more practical FX.<br/><br/>So far in the X-Men series, I enjoyed Mangold's The Wolverine and X2 the most."
"sunshinebeachcinema","8","1","3","14 July 2014"," Entertaining, time-travelling adventure with a great cast!
","Once again, it's time for another superhero movie – another superhero sequel to be precise. There have been a lot of these lately, but that seems to be the way of the world. Now, counting all spin-offs and prequels, we're on the seventh X-Men movie, with an eighth confirmed to be on the way, continuing the franchise that started it all back in 2000. We've even got the original director Bryan Singer back in the chair, who previously abandoned the franchise to make the quickly forgotten Superman Returns (2006).<br/><br/>However, rather than take the easy route and reboot it, this film is an ambitious attempt to reconcile the existing storyline, tie up some of the loose ends of X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and bring it all together with the cast of prequel X-Men: First Class (2011). The result ends up a little jumbled, and there are loads and loads of characters, and multiple actors playing certain characters, but perhaps that's to be expected in any film involving time travel as a major plot point.<br/><br/>That's right, as the title heavily implies, in a Back to the Future- style confusion of tenses, this film is largely set in the '70s, sometime after the events of First Class. It's very easy for me to get behind such a film, chock full of retro vibes, cool cars, leather jackets, burgundy suits, sideburns and Richard Nixon.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in the future, the post-Last Stand world has decayed into a bleak apocalyptic landscape as a result of amazingly advanced mutant- killing robots, which have decimated the population by being too effective – not only do they kill mutants, but they kill those who recessively carry mutant genes and could give birth to mutants in the future.<br/><br/>Naturally, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) must go back in time to the '70s and stop these robots from being developed and mass-produced, ironically by preventing the assassination of their inventor, Bolivar Trask, as it was his death that made the US government see mutants as a credible threat and commission the robots. The delightfully sinister and manipulative Trask is played by Game of Thrones' excellent Peter Dinklage.<br/><br/>Indeed, the cast as a whole is excellent, even if it is large. I never saw First Class, so 'my' X-Men remain that classic cast of thespians including Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, et al. Happily, they're all back after so many years, which is great to see, even if they are only given limited screen time. The exception is Hugh Jackman, who inexplicably remains the closest thing to a leading man despite having two spin-offs of his own. Of course, Wolverine's effortlessly cool, and he's our temporal fish out of water, so who really cares anyway?<br/><br/>In the past, Wolverine runs into younger versions of all his comrades and nemeses, rounding out the ensemble to include Professor X (James McAvoy), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). The lines between friend and foe become blurred as Wolverine works hard to redeem the latter two whilst forcing the young Professor X to confront his demons.<br/><br/>Of note is the first appearance in the X-Men saga of the supersonic Quicksilver (Even Peters) who provides one of the most high-octane, humorous and entertaining sequences of the entire film, a super-fast prison break witnessed in slow motion. It's a shame his character disappears shortly afterwards; probably because his presence would make everything else far too easy for the protagonists.<br/><br/>The mutant saga is skilfully interwoven with mid-20th Century US history, including the Kennedy assassination and the Vietnam War. This sets the scene for a retro globetrotting adventure from Vietnam, to the Peace Conference in Paris, to a final showdown in Washington, D.C. All in all it's an entertaining thrill ride, which (as its main raison d'être is storyline reconciliation) may alienate newcomers to the saga. However, as I said, I haven't seen an X-Men film since The Last Stand and I still enjoyed it. It certainly makes me want to watch both First Class and the original trilogy once again. Maybe even the Wolverine spin-offs. Maybe."

","I was looking forward to this movie coming out especially scents Bryan Singer was directing it. I was expecting an action comedy that was better than all the other moves. high standards I know but it delivered there were greatly choreographed fights (especially by quick sliver. the movie has 2 plots rolled into one wolverine trying to change the past and the X-men trying to survive it. the acting is no problem as usual. and thank god that they make Brett Ratner never happen but once again it proves that no one in this fancies stays dead but it is a vary good finale to the original cast and I can't wait to see what the next movie has in store"
"romes64","10","1","3","11 July 2014"," I was Finally blown away
","This movie is the thing that I reserve the word 'amazing' for.<br/><br/>I loved the way that we were guided through the creative use of so many super-powers. The variety of powers exhibited was so much more than we are used to even from long running TV shows like Heroes and every single exhibition was executed imaginatively and brilliantly. They were able to do this by providing deep and meaningful explanation of why they were limiting the powers on screen. Instead of exploring one or two really powerful powers in the way that They thought were cool, they added and subtracted them without limiting things too much allowing for imagination of really complex interactions. The kind of explanation that gave you a basis for imagining this world. You are so immersed that you could stop focusing on just the vivid graphic image and are setup to try to predict what will happen next. When you believe you have a strategy for playing in this world is when they flip it on you and you are exposed to an even deeper plot or meaning and you're left with more mystery to apply what you know to, from earlier on in the movie and your experiences outside it.<br/><br/>This movie mixes the dreams we have of super powers with the experience of playing strategy and combat games. One thing that particularly comes to mind is Blink's power, I've played hours of Valve's games Portal and Portal 2, playing challenges and designing my own, so I felt with her. I could see myself trying to play through these challenges, thinking on the fly, and I could feel the loss after every death. <br/><br/>Among all the creativity shown through pretty pictures, cool mutations, and ability to stimulate the happiest parts of my imagination, This movie still found time to impact me more. The cut-scene after the credits changes the story entirely, it changes how we view history. The Egyptian pyramids, instead of being a symbol of how religion was able to bring a nation to enslave so many people to build their oppressive relic, to being a gift from a God showing the people what he is capable of so that he can help them. This bit of fantasy paints history in a much better light than I have ever been able to imagine. This pseudo-realistic version gives us hope for another explanation of the past, perhaps a more happy one. We are not locked in the ideas that we believe today.<br/><br/>I can't add much more than, ""I liked it a lot."""
"narareba","8","1","3","9 July 2014"," Sacrifice
","Once again, sorry if I post this with a broken English. I decide to write the review in Bahasa Indonesia and then translate it with google translate.<br/><br/>Watching this film brought a brief message: sacrifice. Are we willing to sacrifice our ambitions for the noble purpose?<br/><br/>1. This is a story about Mystique's choice, whether she should revenge or sacrifice for the future of mutans and human?<br/><br/>2. This is the story of the mutans: they are united and willing to sacrifice himself in order to save the future which they rely on the hands of one of their friends. <br/><br/>3. This is a story about the wolferine. I can finally understand the story since the first movie to the last in Japan. He living in a nightmare; but he was willing to let it go for the future the better living of mutans and human being.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up for the director and the people behind the birth of this film: they can recycle the story of the X-Men, without should get out of the storyline.<br/><br/>And, as always: Hugh Jackman is the best!! <br/><br/>Regards <br/><br/>Narareba"

They have an awesome film to outdo! I can't wait to buy this movie on DVD, so I can show my family what they missed at the theater. Also, so I can watch it again and again! I hope you get the chance to see this movie because I do believe you will like it!"

","It was a great movie since all the characters are born to play the part. The story was based on the comic book series, and I appreciate how they try to be as accurate as possible about the plot. - One thing that really bothered me was that ""Jennifer Lawrence"" as Mystique is not really working. I don't see her as this actress that can play an evil and serious character, and they really should do something about that. There are some scenes where she couldn't play properly or maybe it is just the way I see her. She seems more like an actress that can play a much nicer role. - All in all, I loved the movie and I will recommend this for a friend!"
"zacharykouba","9","1","3","7 July 2014"," Amazing movie
","When I went to see X-men: Days of Future Past I had significantly high standards, yet it still blew my mind. This movie was Awesome. The story's mind-blowing premise is intrinsically detailed, and fits perfectly into the previous movie X-Men: First Class. The storyline is a fast paced thriller that will have you constantly wondering what will happen next. This new installment to the X- men series connects perfectly to the previous X-men: First Class. The storyline takes us through multiple time dimensions when Wolverine is sent back in time to reconnect Professor Xavier and Magneto to save the lives and alter the history of Mutants in society. <br/><br/>The dual acting of Professor Xavier by James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart is amazing. Seeing these two actors portray the same character is a delight; the two have a connection that brings both the past and present day Professor Xavier into a seemingly uniform character. The same goes for Michael Fassbender and Ian McKellan portraying Magneto. The addition of new X-men character is also a great addition to the movie. The cast truly made this movie as great as it is. Seeing the struggles, progressions, and similarities of the characters in different time dimensions played a huge role in tying the whole movie together."
"tjosephubert","9","1","3","6 July 2014"," A Great, Well Produced Reboot
","This is an amazing film, one of the best comic book-movies, perhaps the best, that I have seen. While it does serve as a reboot, at the same time, it also manages to tie in all the other movies that were created prior to it.<br/><br/>The basis of the storyline is this: in 1973 a scientist engineered a group of robotic weapons called the Sentinals that can detect and kill mutants. The creation was perfected when Mystique was captured and her DNA used to design a newer model of these machines. Once released, they waged war on mutants, bringing them to near extinction. In order to save the mutant species, Magneto and Xavier, must use Kitty Pryde's ability to send back someone's conscience to the past in order to stop the creation of the Sentinals. Wolverine, who has the power to heal instantly, is the only one capable to make the trip back because everyone else's' brains will be ""Torn apart."" Once he returns to the past, it is Wolverine's job to find the younger Charles (Xavier) and Erik (Magneto) and stop Mystique's DNA from getting into the hands of the creator of the Sentinals. If they fail, mutants will, without a doubt, be wiped from existence, but if they succeed, they will stop the war from ever happening.<br/><br/>This movie has to be one of the best comic book movies out there. The plot, along with the storying telling aspects, are very strong and support the movie from its opening scenes to its end credits. The acting, as well, is also executed very well; each actor put their utmost in portraying their roles. The character development was also very impressive. In this movie, each characters' decisions felt real, and the events that took place affected how they would ultimately act or behave. And to merge all of these elements together, there are of course the brilliant cinematography and special affects, which will astound everyone at their complexities. When you leave the theater, you know that the creators of this movie were fans of the comic books. This is an epic made from a comic book. It is based around the comics and it shows, and it brings together all the elements that makes us love its source material. When you see this movie, you will feel all the emotion, the power, that the producers, director, and writers felt when they created this movie. This is a stunning comic book film. 9/10."
"numptyur","10","1","3","6 July 2014"," One of the best movies I've seen
","I've been a little burnt out on superhero movies lately, especially X-Men movies. Well I finally decided to give this a shot last night and wow, I never expected it to be this good. This is not only one of the best superhero movies made it's simply one of the best movies I've seen. There are so many awesome moments in this movie but the stand out has to be Quicksilver. Much in the same way Night crawler stole the show in X2 Quicksilver does the same here. Beast is far better done this time around and it was cool to see Wolverine kick butt with his bone claws especially when I wasn't to keen on the idea to start. One again Michael Fassbender is amazing as Magneto. Great to see the old cast back as well. I can't wait to see the next movie now."
"makinghaste","10","1","3","2 July 2014"," Possibly the Best X-Men Film Yet
","X-Men: Days of Future Past may be an overwhelming film for those who are unfamiliar with the rest of the franchise. Despite this, the film's opening narration explains the basics required to understand the plight of mutants. <br/><br/>Though it does bother me that Kitty Pryde is not the one being sent into the past, Days of Future Past was surprisingly not another Wolverine and the X-Men. I like him a lot and everything, but he already has two solo films and the original trilogy is mostly Wolverine-centric anyway. Instead, Logan is used a way of letting us see the conflict between Charles Xavier, Magneto, and Mystique. <br/><br/>The future mutants work together as a tired and war weary group of survivors. Despite the fact that they were all mostly underused, their scenes were definitely entertaining. This is the movie that reminds us that the X-Men are a team. <br/><br/>The past mutants were great as well, but even though Mystique's agency is what defines the future, we see less of this and Mystique is mostly treated as an out of frame entity. I would not mind this choice if Mystique's choice was not the foundation of the plot, but in this movie it is so it doesn't really make sense for her to exist mostly through Charles' and Erik's bickering. Magneto also feels a bit extra at times in the movie. This is really Charles Xavier's film in terms of the past scenes, I suppose. <br/><br/>The movie has a darker tone, and incorporates humor in an organic way; it doesn't feel contrived, even though at one point Quicksilver is running around while Jim Croce's 'Time in a Bottle' plays in the background. There is no back and forth snappy and clever argument, which is something I personally dislike in a film. The movie in total is well acted, and the cast is quite talented. The cinematography was better than the standard superhero fare, and I enjoyed that, especially in the future scenes. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film, and especially great for the X-Men films, which still suffer from X-Men: The Last Stand. I would recommend this to any fans of Marvel, and even if that isn't to your taste, it's still a great movie."
"ghms1011","10","1","3","1 July 2014"," Great Time Travel Movie
","I've always loved time travel movies. This is by far one of the best time travel movies I've ever seen. It's partially actual truth, and partial fantasy as what the X-Men want to change is pretty close to the truth in relation to the last 60 years in the United States. Of course, Jennifer Lawrence character is the most fun to watch as she transforms into numerous other characters. Recently, she said on the tonight show that she has some sort of blue on her skin about 4 months out of the year. The special effects are superb! Nothing is done cheaply in this movie. I've always loved good science fiction, and this is a real good one. I've seen all the previous X-Men movies, and this one is easily the best. Their is a lot of screen time for Jennifer Lawrence so if your a big fan of hers I'm certain you will love this movie. I first saw her in ""Winter's Bone"", and she was great in that movie. Then, it was shortly after that her star rose. Hugh Jackman is the first one to go back in time because he is the only one of the X-Men that has the chemistry to work with the time travel mechanism. Some of the moments where he struggles staying stabilized between the past and present are pretty tense moments where you find yourself hoping nothing bad will happen to him. I thought picking Nixon as the President to change was a good choice as badly as he handle running the country in real life. This is real a must see movie!"

"litchy03","9","1","3","30 June 2014"," Best Xmen film?
","Is days of future past the best Xmen movie so far? Let's look back<br/><br/>Xmen: This was a good film it introduced each of the main characters. The action was not as good as what we see in the films to come but still has enough to keep you interested.<br/><br/>Xmen 2: They really gave this film everything and left you wanting more. The opening scene was great and Wolverine's fight scene in the school was brutal. What really worked well was seeing the mutants come together to take on a new enemy and no one knew how to feel about the ending.<br/><br/>Xmen The Last Stand: This film receives a lot of criticism and in some part deserves it. The story was not that bad, but the execution was terrible. The number of deaths to key characters was what I feel let it down. Remember to watch the final scene after the credits.<br/><br/>Xmen Origins Wolverine: I enjoyed this film, well the first 70 minutes of it. Seeing Wolverine grow up with Sabretooth was interesting.( even tho he was never referred to as Sabretooth) The thing that bought this film down was Dead Pool. Their version of him was really really bad and the final fight scene on top of the reactor was a big letdown. <br/><br/>Xmen First Class: The introduction of a younger Magneto and Professor X was great. Michael Fassbender stole the show and James McAvoy was a great Proffossor X. Kevin Bacon as the villain was at his usual best and Jennifer Lawrence casting as Raven was fantastic. There was less action in this film than any other Xmen movie but the storyline made up for that.<br/><br/>The Wolverine: The 2nd outing with Hugh Jackmans standalone Xmen film. This was much better than his first attempt. He really looked the part and the action in this film was amazing. The fight scene on the bullet train is simply a must see. The film was based in Japan and there were a few people who didn't like that but I thought it was great. This film is considered the most violent of the Xmen films so far. <br/><br/>Now Xmen Days of Future Past: This is a very different Xmen movie based straight from the Xmen cartoon. There were some slight changes but I feel the changes they made where necessary and improved the film. There was a good balance of action vs storyline here which I feel hasn't been done in an Xmen film since X2. The way they explained the time travel was done simply and easy which most people will understand. The introduction of quicksilver was a highlight of the film. <br/><br/>So is Xmen Days of Future Past the best Xmen film I would have to say YES but running a close 2nd is Xmen 2."
"PeterWorthers","10","1","3","29 June 2014"," Welcome back X Men we all know and love..
","Be warned, spoilers ahead me hearties...<br/><br/>When it comes to the X Men franchise I'm sure all nerds will tell you that 1 was the best, 2 was OK but half way through got dumb and that 3 was unneeded and ruined the entire series. Why did X3 tank so bad in the hearts of those who love it? Bryan Singer, thats how. <br/><br/>The man who brought us the beloved comic series was our ringleader through 1 and 2. They had heart and as you watched them you knew Singer put his love of the characters, material and story into each one. 3 was missing Singer, so it was missing the heart and soul of what made the series great.<br/><br/>So after a few years pass and a really well done prequel/reboot to add to the series (enough to get the taste of 3 out of our collective mouths) how do you return to the series you fathered and make it cool again while making the fans care again? TIME TRAVEL.<br/><br/>Yes my friends, with two words director Bryan Singer wipes out the last half of X2 and all of 3 from our minds and re-writes history his way with this addition to the franchise. How do you fix the mistakes of the past, erase them and they never happened! All the main characters from X Men First Class are back, along with the addition of the best loved characters from The original X Men series. It literally is the best of both worlds. Tie in the before mentioned Time Travel element and how can you go wrong? <br/><br/>The Movie takes on the two issue story of the same name, and though us nerds will tell you that they changed quite a few things from comic to screen, the heart of the story is there again, and your genuine care for the wellbeing of our old (and young versions of) friends.<br/><br/>As always a few things bothered me, so if you will humor me for a few seconds...<br/><br/>1-The ending with Mystique got really annoying after a while..""I'm gonna kill him, no i won't, yes I will, no I won't"" JUST DO IT ALREADY!<br/><br/>2-Young Magneto: Wow, he was still a bad guy this whole time! Shocker. Charles, you are too trusting.<br/><br/>3-For a public forum, with the president there, there sure was very little protection. Secret service must have been on LSD that day.<br/><br/>4-The future, with the Sentinels attacking was really slow and drawn out, i know it was for dramatic effect but if this is how they attack, how did they accomplish anything.<br/><br/>5-Wolverine's butt. Come on! Do we really need to get women into this movie THAT bad. I mean it worked (my wife came with me for just that reason) but still. Come on! <br/><br/>6-Quicksilver. It was pretty cool to see him finally in live action form, but his character was not needed that bad. They could have accomplished the exact same thing without him. (but the easter egg with him and Magneto in the elevator was awesome)<br/><br/>7-For wanting to hide the fact that they are mutants from the outside world, they sure did flaunt their powers in public constantly.<br/><br/>8-Young Professor X meets Old Professor X. EPIC!! But you have to admit, young Professor X is a whiny bitch at times.<br/><br/>9-They tie in Wolverines small cameo in First Class perfectly. I was wondering if they would acknowledge that they had already met or not.<br/><br/>10-So Beast can turn the beast power on and off? So hes the Hulk now?<br/><br/>11-If you get to the end, and do not cry when everyone is reunited, YOU HAVE A HEART OF STONE! Once everyone appeared at the Institute I cried like a baby. It was PERFECT! THIS is the way the X Men should be.<br/><br/>So in closing, Bravo Mr. Singer! It looked hopeless there for a while, and even when we heard you had come back the thought was 'How could he possibly save the original series franchise?' I will never doubt you again. Thank you. Thank you."

","By far the best ""X-men related"" outing yet..including Wolverine's solo runs. The saying goes that the stronger the villains the better the movie & DOYP has first-class adversaries in the advanced-sentinels. That opening battle between the half-dozen mutants & Sentinels has to be the best action sequence alongside Nightcrawler's attack on the White House (X2) & Wolverines train fight (The Wolverine). The real-hero of the film is Wolverine. Here he has to mentor his mentor in order to save the mutant & human races & he displays remarkable maturity. The true show-stopper/star-turn though has to be ""Quicksilver"". Cool as a cucumber the scene in which he rescues Magneto from the Pentagon has to be the coolest scene of the series!

There was some scenes clearly made for 3D animation and it didn't turn out that good in 2D. However, the movie in itself sucked me in enough to ignore that, and I could enjoy it without relying on cheap (figuretively) effects.<br/><br/>Last time I felt to revisit a movie so strongly on the big screen again was with The dark knight. It is that good. Of course being an x-men fan helps, but you can walk into this movie without knowing anything about the franchise and still enjoy it. I say this is a sequel to x- men first class. Bringing in wolverine is self explained in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is a solid, great performance, great time, 9/10. Why not 10/10 giving it excellent? IT is excellent as a whole. But comparing Old Xavier to new Xavier, Old magneto to new magneto..they got outplayed by the younger generation. But that is really nitpicking. Since I saw x-men first class, which really defined the 2 leaders, Its hard to adjust back to the old actors."
"Robert_duder","8","1","3","13 June 2014"," Complex and astounding in many ways
","If nothing else (and this is coming from a die-hard DC fan) Marvel will forever be known for doing their franchises right time and time again. Best of all, they are not afraid of staying strict to their comic roots and making their scripts and characters diverse, fiercely intelligent and complex. I wish more than anything I had sunk myself into the entire X-Men series again before going into this and I absolutely recommend doing exactly that before going into this. I know you don't NEED to but it would help IMMENSELY! Days Of Future Past is a complex web of a story that holds nothing back. Don't get me wrong, it makes perfect sense and it is a sci-fi/action lover's dream. I know my low score (comparatively to others) might make you upset but I assure you I thought this was excellently crafted. I just found myself a tad bit lost in trying to remember everything that came before it. I was certain that director Bryan Singer would complicate this more than it should have been. Most fans agree he dropped the ball with X-Men 3 but I am proud to say he actually used the old cast in the best possible way (minimizing their involvement.) However, where I felt the film stumbled just a little was the lack of characters in it. It certainly focuses on Wolverine, young Magneto and young Charles but the amazing cast from the ""First Class"" film are sadly lacking. There really isn't any additional development in the characters and despite a strong action storyline, it falls in character development. Its one and only flaw.<br/><br/>I think we've all long agreed Hugh Jackman is and always will be Wolverine/Logan. I can't say much else about him because he becomes the character, he is iconic and amazing in the role. He was the one good thing about the disastrous Wolverine film from last year. However, this time around felt a little lacking for him and it wasn't his usual level of performance in the role. I could say the same for the rest of the cast honestly. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were absolutely astonishing in First Class as younger counterparts to Xavier and Magneto. They were still good in this but it was missing that same level of ""wow"" factor. Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique probably got the most development of the cast in this film and yet she still didn't seem to be as great as she was in the original and we know all these actors are fantastic. I think Singer focused so much on the script that he sort of uses the characters as backdrop to the story. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan return in their iconic roles and they are used sparingly but perfectly for the course of the film without getting in the way. Same for the rest of the old cast who are really barely there including Halle Berry and a few tiny cameos from the original X-Men cast. Nicholas Hoult and Ellen Page have important roles but again very small comparatively to First Class. Peter Dinklage was a great addition as our ""villain"" of sorts. He did a terrific job but (I'm going to say it again) underused.<br/><br/>The heart of this story is the Sentinel program and the time travel aspect in a desperate attempt to stop cataclysmic destruction in the future. The Sentinels were every comic geeks focal point going into this. The build up to finally seeing them for the first time was perfect and they don't disappoint. They are exactly what any fan would want. The other thing Days of Future Past knocks clear out of the park are the special effects...WOW. This was some of the best CGI and special effects I have seen in years. Give them an Oscar right now because nothing comes close. Nothing looks fake or cheap and the scenes are awe inspiring. Singer did some truly outstanding direction here and he should be heralded for it. The one flaw...which I think I've explained enough is that the characters feel just a little underdeveloped and I like my superheroes to be complex characters which X-Men has always done very well. I'm a little surprised the reaction this is getting from fans. Even a friend of mine called it ""the best superhero film ever made."" I can't quite agree with that. It definitely jumps some seriously astounding hurdles but I still don't feel in a lot of ways it matched First Class or even some of the earlier X-Men films. Still a first rate summer blockbuster!! 8.5/10"

I think its really hard to get everything-everyone have same equal lining & play the script it's really that much hard to find those sequence & edit to make it 1 hour 30 minutes & give everything to make believe what really happening in Days of Future past & Bryan Singer just made it Awesome. Nothing to say 'bout Hugh Jackman or Ian Mckellen both were outstanding. I really love the Young Professor X: Jamess McAvoy, so Intense. The best part of the movie i think when Quick Silver(Evan Peters) was saving Magneto(Michael fassbender) & Professor X(James Mcavoy) from getting shot everything slows down through his Super speed, must say Cgi of this Bullet Time Sequence is too cool & drastically funny to watch..... Script, Direction, character Play & Animation Everything is so Perfect... As Marvel"

We have Hugh Jackman returning as Wolverine, and there's not much to say about him that hasn't already been said. He is Wolverine, the role is made for him and he absolutely owns it. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are incredible as Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr respectively, their characters have an amazing relationship and the two of them are just phenomenal at pulling it off. We also have the future X-Men cast with the like of Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan and Ellen Page, and while they have a lot less screen time they're still great. I was surprised at how prominent a role Jennifer Lawrence had as Mystique, over the past few months I've had a growing dislike towards Jennifer Lawrence but I can't deny that she is great in this role. Then we have all of the new characters, like Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), Bishop (Omar Sy) and Blink (Bingbing Fan), all of whom are great. But there is one new character who is greater than all, and that character is Quicksilver."
"DonnyMovieMan","5","1","3","4 June 2014"," Average execution makes it feel average
","The action is often pretty cool and there is a lot of time spent on character, but while watching it, I just didn't really care. I felt that the way that the dialogue was executed was too generically action-movie-esque and it didn't feel authentic enough for me to care about these characters on the level that the film wanted me to. I know that the film tries to be more, as it, has a better focus on character and depth than an average superhero movie, but it feels like the movie wanted me to watch the dialogue like a dumb person because of the execution and I felt a little dumb while watching it. James McAvoy had the most developed character and his was the easiest to care about. None of the others have a whole lot going on, except for Jennifer Lawrence at the end. The score and editing were set to default and the direction doesn't make the human drama aspects feel like authentic human drama. It was done in a familiar way, which made me feel like the movie itself was nothing special. The nothing special execution doesn't match that the movie wants to be special. I didn't exactly want to leave when I was watching it, but I wanted it to get good and it never really did outside of some cool action scenes."
"matthewssilverhammer","7","1","3","3 June 2014"," Best X-Men Yet
","I love time travel science fiction; however, I'm wary of sequels based in traveling to the past in order to wash away problems created in previous films. The storytellers need to have a strong sense of purpose, some stylish originality, and a good amount of self-awareness in order to pull it off (think Abrams brilliant ""Star Trek"" reboot). Luckily, Singer has nailed it with X-Men: Days of Future Past. Granted, it teeters on convolution and an over-abundance of comic-lore, but the story plays out gracefully and the characters are a blast. Add impeccable sound design and some top-notch scifi action, X-Men:DOFP is a tight and fun superhero romp. X-Men:DOFP follows Wolverine, sent to the past by old Magneto and Professor X to meet up with young Magneto, Professor X and other X-Men in the 1970s, in order to stop an event that sets course for a world war that destroys all mutants and much of civilization itself.confused? Don't worry, the Inception-like levels of plot are better focused within the film, and the emphasis is more on the socio-political themes of the first two X-Men: equality, weaponry, freedom. On top of this, the period piece look is outstanding, and the performances are great, especially Fassbender, Dinklage, and Jackman, who is a Godsend as Wolverine. The ultimate selling point here is the action, which while a bit overly violent for its rating, is stellar, especially with some truly unique use of bullet-time slow motion. This helps us overlook the silly and unnecessary over-explanation and exposition spewing. With strong direction, impressive visuals, and taut enthusiasm, X-Men:DOFP is the best X-Men yet."
"michaelward291-17-433659","9","1","3","2 June 2014"," The best x-men yet. Definitely worth watching
","There was lots of hype for this film and I was hoping that it would keep up to this hype, and it truly did. <br/><br/>From the start of the film to the end, every bit kept me interested. Not once was I waiting for a ""good part"". I thought that the movie would just be based on wolverine, but I was glad to see all the characters, both the first class and original cast, to all get a good amount of time. Also, I was glad to see wolverine was not the only important character of this story. I thought that wolverine would be the main centre of the film, but other characters were just as important as him.<br/><br/>Now quicksilver, he was absolutely amazing and hilarious. His scene was definitely one of my favourite. The special effects, the humour and the importance of his scene is why his scene was one of my favourite.<br/><br/>The sentinels..... they are now one of my favourite enemies in marvel films. During the film the story went from 1973 to 2023 every now and then, and the pure strength and power of the sentinels shows why the population on earth is nearly extinct. The sentinels are formidable opponents, not once did I ever think ""how are mutant population at risk?"" Also, there is a simple good explanation on how the sentinels are really hard to defeat.<br/><br/>The time travel concept was way better than I thought. I, myself like movies with time travel, but I had a feeling that it was going to do a complicated time travel concept.<br/><br/>But it was very simple (a mild spoiler now). Kitty prides phasing ability evolved so she can send people's consciousness back in time. So she sends wolverine back in time to alter history. But wolverine's consciousness can only stay in his past self if kitty pride is alive. So wolverine has to alter history before the sentinels finds the 2023 xmen. This is about how complicated it can get.<br/><br/>The specials effects/CGI, whatever you want to call it, was really good. Seeing magneto lift up the stadium or the 2023 xmen fighting the sentinels, not once did I ever think the effects bad. Not once did it remind me of the xmen origins wolverine special effects.<br/><br/>Bolivar Trask however, was not as intimidating and scary as expected. Although he was the creator of the sentinels, he was overshadowed by a different enemy. Peter dinklage still done a good performance as trask, showing his motivation of the sentinel program.<br/><br/>Apart from that which this minor fault did not have a great impact, xmen days of future past is one of the greatest films yet and you should definitely watch this film."
"TheConnoisseurReviews","9","1","3","1 June 2014"," The best X-Men yet...
","From the very beginning, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" had me hooked. It tells an endearing story of the struggles of survival for these mutants as they are picked off one by one by the monstrous and vicious Sentinels. The X-Men have to work together with their past selves, in order to secure their future. It is a fun and highly well told story that pays of not only in the action, but also emotionally.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer is at his best as he directs a large cast of mutants through an emotionally endearing story that will leave viewers in awe of what is happening and what is to come for the franchise. I really appreciated a lot of the stylized directing, it really made the film that much more fun. The visuals are used impressively and the action sequences are directed incredibly well. I was literally at the edge of my seat every time the characters were in combat as I literally felt that they might lose their lives. The script is packed with great character moments and we get to learn a lot more about our favorite mutants. The time traveling is handled incredibly well and as long as you don't try to break it down, it is satisfyingly well handled.<br/><br/>The cast is great and they really own their characters. Fassbender and McAvoy are great replacements as Magneto and Professor Xavier, respectively. They provide great emotional performances as well give us some great character moments. Jennifer Lawrence has come a long way from her first performance as the blue shape shifting femme fetal, Mystique. She finally fits the role perfectly as she is sleek, sexy, and highly unpredictable. And as always, Hugh Jackman is just spot on as Wolverine.<br/><br/>Overall, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is a the quintessential summer blockbuster this year. It has everything from amazing action, thought provoking and emotionally satisfying story that delivers on all cylinders, and a great cast of talented actors. This not only is the best movie of the year so far, it is also the best X-Men movie yet and personally it's in my top 3 favorite comic book movies of all time list. I give it a incredibly high 4.5/5."
"Matt_Layden","8","1","3","1 June 2014"," One Of The Series Best
","With Singer back in the fold, many people felt like the series was back in good hands. He comes back after the failed attempt at reviving the Superman franchise and a battle of a fairy tale, Jack The Giant Killer. Those two projects seemed to fail with critics and audiences alike, so Singer is back to the films that made him a household name. I would personally like to see another small scale film like Apt Pupil or The Usual Suspects, but the guy has a visual eye that blends well with the big budget scaled films, so I'll take him here. Singer opens with a well choreographed fight between mutants and their new enemy, the Sentinels. Some neat powers are introduced, such as portals used by a new mutant Blink, which aid in the fight against these mutant killing machines. Once we get passed the explosive opening, we are given the set up, Logan must travel back in time and change the future. Some expository dialogue from Xavier and we are on our way back to the 70's.<br/><br/>Now, for people wanting to know where we are in the X-Men timeline. The past sequences are after the events of First Class, so the rift between Erik and Charles is present, but it is before the events of X-Men Origins, so before Logan has his adamantium. He's stuck with his bone claws here and in a surprising turn of events, we hardly get to see him use them. While a lot of the other films were ""Wolverine"" heavy, DOFP seems to be more of an ensemble piece, giving equal time to much deserving characters. A new addition, Peter AKA Quicksilver, has the most memorable sequence in the film and his scenes again, show the visual excitement that Singer brings back to the franchise. <br/><br/>In the past, Logan has to convince Xavier to help him, but he has lost the use of his powers due to an experimental drug he uses developed by Hank McCoy (Beast) that gives him the ability to walk again. Xavier is stuck in a depressed isolated place, he's lost his friend Erik, Raven has abandoned him, the school is shut down. He's not in a good place. Logan has to do for him what Xavier did for Logan back in the original films. Help him find his way. McAvoy isn't afraid to let the character, who is almost always calm, cool, collected and smart...with more of an edge. He's lost, he's refusing to acknowledge his power exists. Magneto on the other hand is in prison. People claim he is responsible for the assassination of JFK and they need to bust him out. They still don't see eye to eye and Fassbender brings the angry hostility that a young man with a lot of power would have. He wants to be the superior species whether he is or not. His plan in't the same as Logans/Xavier's and the conflict arises. <br/><br/>Back in the future, Patrick Stewart, Ian Mckellen, Halle Berry, Ellen Page and others are given nothing to do but basically wait. Time is running out for them as Sentinels close in. They try their best to fend them off, but their screen time is a little too short for us to fully invest. Singer relies heavily on previous films for us to care. Most of the conflict is in the 70's. Which look like a far out time to live in. Lava lamps, Vietnam, Nixon, etc. The world Singer creates feels real enough and he follows in the footsteps of First Class director Matthew Vaughn in having mutants be responsible are involved in our real human history. This is a nice touch that pulls the audience in, gives us something more to chew on. <br/><br/>As dark as the film is, Singer has just the right amount of light comedy to remind us that we are watching a comic book film. A wink and a nod here and there are welcomed, especially those who are fans of the comics and know certain character relations. DOFP is exciting, thrilling and one hell of a ride. I'd place this entry up there with X-2. It tries to mend the broken bones that was left behind from Ratner and his Last Stand, which was a poorly written, visual disaster. Yet DOFP falters in some areas, mostly in the continuity round. <br/><br/>First Class screwed up a lot in the continuity department with the other films. Certain character relationships, history, plot, etc. Last Stand screwed things up with unemotional character deaths and juggling of two awesome stand alone story lines into one big mess. DOFP doesn't feel like it has to answer some important questions. Like, how does Wolverine has adamantium claws in the future, who know from the events of The Wolverine he doesn't. How does Xavier still have his body? he transferred consciousness in the end of Last Stand. Who built cerebro? Two conflicting answers. Why does Logan have white hair when he ""doesn't age"" but everyone else looks the exact same age. Some interesting things I thought to myself was when Logan goes back in time, Xavier is depressed...he hasn't changed the past yet, so what was it that originally brought him out of his funk to form the x-men? Why is his relationship with Mystique so important now, but never mentioned in the other films? Chalk this up to oversight when the originals were made, but it would still be nice to see them correct this mess in the film. <br/><br/>It seems they wanted to hit a big RESET button, which they did, but I still have my questions, questions I feel will never be answered, but that's just the film student comic geek in me talking. DOFP is THE summer blockbuster of this year and one helluva good time."
"jhigginbotham151","9","1","3","1 June 2014"," Bryan Singer is back to save the franchise
","X-Men has been a dying franchise for a while now. Last Stand was good for what it was and I don't blame Ratner for how mediocre it was compared to the original and X2, but Origins was a poor effort and last years The Wolverine showed that Wolverine wasn't the only thing that made the original two films great, and First Class showed that an X-Men film didn't even need Wolverine to be great. Days Of Future Past is exactly the type of film this franchise needed to be saved... and who better that the man who started it all, Bryan Singer, to save it for us.<br/><br/>The film got off to a brilliant start with the theme and very similar title sequence to X2, Singer clearly wanted you to know the boss is back and he ain't messing around. The film started off with one of the most heartbreaking scenes I have seen in the X-Men franchise. Colossus, Ice Man and more all getting demolished, decapitated, burned alive etc by what seem like unstoppable Sentinels. Its something I don't think we are used to in the superhero genre and it sets the tone perfectly for whats to come.<br/><br/>I wont spoil the whole thing for you but there are many scenes that make you care about these characters, there thoughts and feelings, who they are and it reminds you that these are people who are fighting for the right to fit in with a society that cant look past their differences. A competition between Eric and Charles on a plane is a tense and emotional scene that shows that both men have motives that are neither right or wrong, but a different way of dealing with the same problem.<br/><br/>The music I have to say is a high point. Just a beautiful score by John Ottman. The effects are some of the best I have seen in a superhero film. The action scenes are intense but easily followed and the use of the 70s style news cameras to capture some of the action gives the film a different edge and makes it stand out in a great way. The shaky cam is also nowhere to be found.... Booyah. Also, Jennifer Lawrence in nothing but blue paint... yeah.<br/><br/>Quicksilver is actually not as bad and annoying as I thought, he doesn't have a huge role but he does have one of the best scenes in the film and Evan Peters plays him well. Also, props to the Nixon actor, Mark Camacho was actually a great Nixon, I think Nixon may just be the most portrayed President ever actually.<br/><br/>Overall, Days Of Future Past is the best entry in the X-Men franchise, it manages to blend both timelines together seamlessly and gives every character reasonable screen time so nobody feels wasted. It revitalised the franchise and makes me all the more excited for Apocalypse in 2016"

","I have always enjoyed the X-Men. From TV shows to Movies, they have always interested me. However, X-Men: days of Future Past is the best one yet. <br/><br/>Story- 9/10<br/><br/>The Days of Future Past storyline could have been difficult arc to adapt into a movie, becoming confusing for casual moviegoers and non-comic readers. However, the story was handled with such delicacy that it was a marvel to watch. <br/><br/>Acting- 9/10<br/><br/>Like any superhero team-up movies, there is always going to be a big group of actors. All of the major characters were portrayed very well, with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), both Magnetos (Michael Fassbender & Ian McKellen), both Professor Xs (James McAvoy & Patrick Stewart) and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) being extraordinary as always. However the ""acting"" from Halle Berry as Storm wasn't up to scratch with the rest of the film. <br/><br/>Direction- 9/10<br/><br/>Bryan Singer's X-Men comeback was pretty good for the director of the first two impressive films. The hidden Xs throughout the film, the cutting between past and future and the overall scope helped show just how influential this man can be.<br/><br/>Feelings- 10/10<br/><br/>You know it is a good film when you are walking out of the cinema feeling great, like you just watched the best movie ever. Although this feeling fades, you know that you will want to watch it again. And that's what Days of Future Past does to you<br/><br/>Overall- 9.4/10<br/><br/>Walking out of the cinema, I was prepared to give a 10.

"spaldinghome","10","1","3","30 May 2014"," The new X-Men are just getting better
","I'll keep it short: Epic. <br/><br/>While the first X-Men trilogy was a decent effort, the re-imagined ""First Class"" garnered significant praise for its success fixing what was broken and not making the same mistakes. It was a world that pulled us in more and felt less like we were watching a movie. <br/><br/>Days of Future Past is as much an improvement on First Class, as First Class was on the earlier trilogy. It takes what was done right in first class and continues it - first and foremost, it keeps its tradition of high quality actors playing to their individual strengths. <br/><br/>It's got me excited for what we have to look forward to in the future.<br/><br/>This is a movie worth seeing in the theaters. <br/><br/>Bottom line, I think this goes down as one of the great comic book movies."
"kclibraryguy","9","1","3","30 May 2014"," I was worried...
","When I first heard about this film project, I thought it was great that someone was going to attempt one of the truly groundbreaking story lines of Marvel comics. I also thought that the filmmakers would find some way to mess it up. After all, though I loved X-Men: First Class, I wasn't sure that the magic would continue with this film. Rather I was dreading something closer to X-Men 3. Though there are some points that are not made clear (how is it that Wolverine can be sent to the past in the way he is? It is different from the way a Kitty Pryde is sent back in the comics, which did make some sense). If you are willing to let that point go (and you have to, or the film will be no fun), I think this does a great job with the idea of time travel and how some errors can be corrected before they are set in stone. And we also see a rather nice story of redemption."
"ishansaha24","8","1","3","30 May 2014"," The best of all Marvel Films ever created
","This movie is better than all marvel movies, even better than marvel avengers. But somehow those have not seen the prequels will rate this movie 7 or 8 on 10. Everything in this movie is related to all the previous xmen series. Bryan Singer's best overall performance in marvel films. Casting was excellent as usual, Hugh Jackman the best suited as Wolverine's physique and style and wonderful performances by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, lets not forget James Avoy who acted exceptionally according to the situation. Bryan Singers and the story writers pushed this movie plot very well along with the previous prequels. Little to much of violence and special effects, but what can we say when there are mutants? Excellent correlation of movie plot. All those who haven't watched the previous prequels, I suggest them to watch xmen, xmen2 , xmen the last stand, xmen origin wolverine and xmen first class for the best experience of a sequel ever. Trust me that this movie is better to watch as sequel rather than watching it as a first film. (To be honest I enjoyed this sequel more than lord of the rings 3). So hurry up and watch the film and rate this movie it IMDb for an 8, 9 or a 10 and create wonderful filmy memory."
"cmyers87","10","1","3","30 May 2014"," Ready to Reboot!
","So this may just be the most pivotal movie in the X-Men franchise right now, and not just because it connects the trilogy to the Wolverine movies and to First Class. However, before I get started on that, allow me to recap the movies (and their problems).<br/><br/>In the original trilogy set we saw Storm, Cyclopse and Jean as Charles' first students and see a new set of X-Men being readied. We watch as Logan develops from loaner/bad boy to part of the team - and still a bad boy. We get to see a war nearly erupt and be quelled all in one great moment. At the end of the trilogy we see Professor X dead, Jean and Scott dead, Raven and Magneto have lost their powers (although Magneto may have been regaining his if you go by the final scene in X3), and all seems to be well with the world again - more or less.<br/><br/>First Class showed the beginning, but had some things wrong. We saw Scott's (Cyclopse) brother, even though Scott was supposed to be older and a first student. We see Azazle, a teleporter, which is only worth mentioning because the Professor was confused when they were tracking Nightcrawler as though he's never seen one before. Cerebro(sp?) apparently wasn't so much built by Charles and Erik as Hank(Beast) was the original creator. Charles couldn't walk by the end, even though in X3 we see him and Erik both WALKING into a young Jean's house after the events at Cuba. And several other things that didn't match and we could be here all day making that list, so I'll move on.<br/><br/>The Wolverine took place after all of the above so I'll leave it alone, but Origins: Wolverine was pre-trilogy. My biggest complaint here is that this movie took it upon itself to proclaim Victor Creed as the official half-brother to Logan. We don't have any solid proof of this throughout canon, but it has been hinted to time and again. While this has zero holdings on the current matter at hand, I felt the need to mention it (as well as the less-than-appealing version of Gambit in this writer's opinion).<br/><br/>Now, on to Days of Future Past, the real reason any of you are here. The majority of these issues are resolved in the movie, which seems to have been the whole point. We see the use of String Theory to reboot the franchise again (basically what Star Trek did), which I have no problem with at all. I'm actually very excited to see what the Disney-owned Marvel Studios will do with X-Men now that they have a clean slate. The way I see this going is basically the next set of movies will be a flash back filling in the history we don't know anymore. Or at least I hope that's how this roles forward, but we'll have to wait and see on that.<br/><br/>All of the characters were portrayed expertly! We see Magneto returned to full strength (okay after the end of X3) working along side Professor X (never explained how he made his return from the grave). We have the kids all grown up with some new friends fighting the new enemy, and I love how they show future and past at the same time going through similar struggles from time to time. I am glad to say they didn't try to bring back Scott and Jean for the movie, one reincarnation is probably enough.<br/><br/>At one point Hank even mentions Quantom Mechanics and how sometimes things are fixed and can't change in the time line, this will certainly allow for why some things never change. We will need some constants in our lives if we're to accept whatever comes after Day of Future Past.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, there was nothing poorly done here. The visuals were stunning! I didn't see it 3D, myself, but I have a friend that did and I'm told it's worth the extra couple of bucks. I know it may seem meaningless to some, but the soundtrack was wonderful. The brief interaction with Quicksilver was simply hilarious while maintaining a heroic nature; he may be a punk kid, but he certainly has potential. I'm actually sad that he won't be played by the same actor in the next Avengers movie. I couldn't help by try to see Tyrion Lanister in Trask's place, Peter Dinklage was great. The role wasn't entirely dissimilar, to be honest. A brilliant man attempting to change the world around him using whatever means at his disposal, Tyrion and Trask are brothers separated by years (and franchises).<br/><br/>Overall if you're sad that Professor X died, unhappy with the inconsistency of the six movies to date, just want to see some bad-assery in the future and the past, then this movie is all about you!"
"aharmas","10","1","3","29 May 2014"," So Good in Many Ways!!!!!
","Watching a movie can be plenty of fun. Seeing a good movie in a movie theater is an experience that is hard to beat, and having the opportunity to see a great film turn into a classic in front of your eyes is a pleasure that it is hard to match, and that is the case with this chapter in X-Men saga. It's an almost perfect film, a thrill to sit through, a perfect blend of technical and good writing. This film proves that quality is not equal to classical drama, but something that occurs when you have some very talented people working together and giving you the best they can.<br/><br/>For starters, that marvelous cast, all of them in a perfect ensemble. Some taking care of the philosophy and the ""heavy"" duty stuff that gives X-Men its soul. Here we have Magneto and Xavier struggling with a love affair and the future of their kind. Two beings who know they must find a way to walk the thin line that could turn them into monsters and ruin humanity's chances of survival. Then there is the team that they need to support and protect, and who can help maintain their safety on Earth. It pays to hire some of the best: Berry, Jackman, Fassbender, and a list that is too long to mention.<br/><br/>Then we have one amazing piece of writing, weaving two time periods into a very tight story line that has the very difficult issue of time travel explored and played with in a very exciting manner. Bodies drops and destinies change in front of our eyes for better or worse. Nothing is simple, as we can see when Xavier and Magneto meet again, so to speak. Then there are those moments when all of these people are in the middle of a confrontation with their mortality, and we can see that we are really not that different from each other. Jackman just keeps getting better and better at making us forget how strong the soul of his character is. We know all of them struggle with the duality of their nature, but Wolverine makes it easier to understand that pain, and it doesn't hurt that he is very good at displaying his powers in action.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie deals with its heart, and this is pretty much left in the hands of Lawrence, who has grown so much in front of our eyes in the last few years. She has fire in her performance, and we can see the passion, the determination, and the fear when trying to choose when it's o.k. to listen. I wonder about the choreography of her fights, and if she's involved, I am in awe.<br/><br/>The story is basic. Wolverine must go back in time (his essence) anyway, and he has to find a way to stop a series of events to save both humans and mutants from a fate worse than death and/or death itself. The introductory scenes dazzle, as we see our heroes working in perfect unison trying to escape those machines that have been created in the past and now are exterminating every mutant they encounter. They are the perfect killing machines, and it's ironic that their source of power has originated from a mutant, too. In the beginning, things look pretty bad for everyone involved.<br/><br/>The ride gets more exciting, as the trip to the past begins, and we are treated to another of the highlights of this fantastic piece of cinema, as we see that it takes an action film to really bring out some of the best in craftmanship. We see sets that blow our minds as we are literally, with the help of 3D and much creative talent to the 70's. ""American Hustle"" was praised to heaven and had very little to offer. This film has huge sets, dazzling amounts of costumes, props to satisfy the biggest of cynics. Cars, drinks, furniture, hairdos, all perfectly integrated and propelling the story forward, without trying to be call attention to themselves by being too clever. Everything has a function here, and it's perfectly performed.<br/><br/>In the end, there's only one small disappointment here, and it is the fact that it will be very difficult to match this film. Earlier in 2014, ""Captain America II"" gave us a taste of what could be done when focus is regained, and this ""X-Men"" entry proves that practice makes perfect, and that careful planning and execution can indeed result in miracles. I know they only give 10 stars here, but I could probably go for an even dozen."
"RevRonster","10","1","3","28 May 2014"," The X-Film that we all needed!
","This is, without a doubt, my favorite X-film to date! <br/><br/>After ""The Last Stand"" left a very unpleasant taste in the mouths of many X-Men fans and after ""Origins"" didn't quite kick off an X-men spin off series as well as it should have, it seemed that ""First Class"" was going to be the film that would be responsible for bringing the franchise back to the greatness it had during ""X2."" While ""First Class"" is awesome, ""Days of Future Past"" feels like an apology for even allowing the existence of ""The Last Stand"" and Bryan Singer's return meant making up for that mistake.<br/><br/>You either love him or hate him for what he brings to the X-Men table but Singer really delivered with this adaptation of the iconic comic storyline. The spirit of the pages is there and the scope is so much bigger than anything else in this X-franchise. Seeing this movie crossover the First Class with the Old Class is awesome in and of itself but seeing how Singer was able to balance out this very large cast and make it feel like every character was important, no matter what size role they had. It was also very cool to see many fan favorites, such as Bishop, Blink and Quicksilver, make the jump to the big screen and actually have a part to play and not feel like they are just a nod-and-a-wink to the comic fans like what happens so often in X-films.<br/><br/>Even though the story is very plot-heavy, the film never gets boring. The pace is perfect and the film is capable of being action-packed, character driven, and filled with tension as the fate of all mutants is placed in the hands of one mission that could easily go disastrously wrong. This, actually, is a great metaphor for the film itself. ""Days of Future Past"" could have easily become a disaster just slightly worse than the fake abs that Vinnie Jones sported as the Juggernaut in ""The Last Stand"" but Singer really crafted a film that feels superior to all other X-titles and contains a story that gave a shot of adrenaline to the franchise and has set the stage up for more adventures for both the young and the old classlike the fight against Apocalypse that is on the way.<br/><br/>""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" went above and beyond my expectations and delivered an X-film that not only creates a promising future for the mutants in the world of cinema but it also proved that Fox is finally ready to start taking their X-Men cash cow seriously and do with them what Marvel Studios is currently doing with the Avengers.<br/><br/>Hi there! Feel like reading more of my rants, ramblings, geek references, grocery lists, and more movie reviews (including a more in-depth review of ""Days of Future Past"" and other, non-X-titles)?

"Hellmant","10","1","3","23 May 2014"," Easily the best movie in the series since Singer last directed!
","'X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The seventh 'X-MEN' movie is once again directed by Bryan Singer (returning to the franchise for the first time since 2003's 'X-MEN 2') and written by Simon Kinberg (who also co-wrote 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND') with Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman (Vaughn and Goldman also co-wrote 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS', which Vaughn also directed). It's based on a 2 issue storyline from the Marvel Comics comic book 'The Uncanny X-Men', called 'Days of Future Past' (written by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, in 1981), which has the X-Men using Kitty Pride's abilities, to time travel a person's mind back in time, in order to stop a dystopian future where mutants are hunted down and killed by Sentinels (giant robots). Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult, Ellen Page, Halle Berry, Shawn Ashmore, Daniel Cudmore, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart all reprise their roles from previous movies. Anna Paquin also returns as Rogue but most of her scenes were cut from the final theatrical film. Peter Dinklage, Omar Sy, Evan Peters, Josh Helman, Bingbing Fan, Booboo Stewart and Adan Canto all join the cast this time around as well. I found it to be highly entertaining and everything I hoped it would be; easily the best movie in the series since Singer last directed. <br/><br/>The story begins in 2023; a dark dystopian future where mutants are being killed off by shape-shifting machines called Sentinels. A small group of X-Men have been able to survive by using Kitty Pryde's (Page) power to transport another mutant's mind, Bishop (Sy), back in time (to warn them about future Sentinel attacks). Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart), now working with Magneto (McKellen), comes up with the idea of time-traveling back to a crucial event, in 1973, in order to prevent the current nightmarish world (they live in) from ever happening. Wolverine (Jackman) is the only one who can survive several decades of time-travel (due to his healing powers), so it becomes his mission to find the young Xavier (McAvoy) and Magneto (Fassbender) and get them to stop Mystique (Lawrence) from assassinating a man named Bolivar Trask (Dinklage). Trask designed the Sentinels and became a martyr, in the war on mutants, when he was killed. Mystique was also captured and her DNA was used to give the Sentinels the abilities they now have (to replicate any mutant's powers). Stopping these events should then change the future and it's up to Wolverine, Charles, Magneto and Beast (Hoult) to pull it off. <br/><br/>I read 'The Uncanny X-Men' comics when I was a kid (and all of it's spin-offs, like 'X-Force', 'Cable' and 'X-Factor') for multiple years (and read several years of back issues too, including 'Days of Future Past'). So I'm a big fan; next to Spider-Man they're my favorites superheroes. The X-Men stories have always had very cool sci-fi elements, and plenty of action, but they've also had deeper themes about dealing with bigotry and being an outsider (like Spider-Man). This is why I could always really identify with the characters and the stories. I love Singer's first two movie adaptations ('X-MEN 2' is one of my all-time favorite films) because they do such a great job of bringing the characters, and those issues, to the big screen. This movie is equally as impressive; it has all the spectacle and action (that all of the films in the franchise are known for) but it also does a really good job of capturing those human elements (and emotions). It's probably my 2nd favorite movie in the series and it's great to see almost all of the cast back for it. I especially enjoy watching Jennifer Lawrence, in the role of Mystique, because she makes a great badass action heroine and it's cool to see her playing a kick-ass villain this time as well. Jackman, Fassbender, McAvoy and all the rest are of course good once again too but it's Singer (back at the helm) that truly gives the movie it's masterpiece status.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-G3-O3wYgs"
"wonderwill","9","1","3","26 May 2014"," One. Single. Word.
","This movie can be summarized in a single word: XMEN. From the very beginning of the movie, the XMEN XMEN with the other XMEN, as the XMEN XMEN alongside each each other. XMEN has it all - XMEN loving, XMEN hating, XMEN fighting, XMEN hugging, XMEN smiling and XMEN frowning. And most of all, the XMEN never cease to XMEN. In honor of the XMEN, I would suggest that we offer this XMEN movie a glowing round of applause - since it allows us, too, to XMEN with the XMEN. If I were one of the XMEN, I would join the XMEN and fight against the XMEN haters too, just like the XMEN do in XMEN. However, I have a single problem with XMEN, and it is that, like the other XMEN movies before it, I just wished the XMEN could XMEN more before XMEN was over. XMEN."
"jtakhirov","7","1","3","26 May 2014"," Decent movie, but disappointing
","There is nothing spectacular about this movie. The best part was the beginning, where they were in the future fighting the Sentinels. The action was raw and realistic and the CGI was amazing.<br/><br/>However, once they traveled back in time, things got a bit boring. I just feel like some of these guys are not very good actors or don't go very deep into their characters.<br/><br/>I love Hugh Jackman, but he has no passion as the Wolverine anymore. Overall, I was disappointed with this movie. It started off on a very high note but got real boring.<br/><br/>2 Things I wanna point out.<br/><br/>1. One of the Coolest scenes was when Quicksilver disarms all of those bodyguards<br/><br/>2. Why the hell did Magneto bring an entire stadium to surround the White House when the President is hiding in a Bunker underground? LMAO! Makes NO SENSE!!!!"
"Argemaluco","8","1","3","26 May 2014"," X-Men: Days of Future Past is quite a solid superheroes film
","Like many films about time travel, X-Men: Days of Future Past occasionally stumbles over its own rules. Besides, there are some inconsistencies in the continuity of the saga, not to mention that the screenplay has few things in common with the comic Days of Future Past. All those factors make the narrative to feel a bit disperse, because there are so many characters and events that the scenes don't always flow naturally, and it can be noticed that screenwriter Simon Kinberg had to give them some push. But fortunately, X-Men: Days of Future Past has much more pros than cons. The characters continue with their evolution and learning, invariably considering their nature over their mutant powers, and as consequence, the film isn't only enjoyed because of the epic battles between human and mutants, but also because of the emotional conflicts from the characters. In other words, X-Men: Days of Future Past doesn't only care for the special effects, but also for the dialogues and the human conflicts. However, that doesn't mean that the battles and the special effects are bad; on the opposite, there are some excellent displays of mutant power (Quicksilver's appearance and Mystique in Paris come to mind). As for the actors, they all made a perfect work, highlighting James McAvoy, Hugh Jackman and the great Peter Dinklage. In conclusion, I would consider X-Men: Days of Future Past inferior to X-Men, X2 and X-Men: First Class, but superior to X-Men: The Last Stand, X-Men Origins: Wolverine and The Wolverine. But whatever the way it is, I found it very entertaining, and I consider it worthy of a recommendation."
"Anurag-Shetty","10","1","3","25 May 2014"," An outstanding film that does justice to its massive cast. The best X-Men movie, yet!
","X-Men: Days of Future Past continues with the adventures of the X-Men. 2023, a dark & hopeless future. Most of the mutants & humans have been wiped out by the Sentinels. Sentinels are dangerous robots that can adapt to any mutant's powers, which make them far more superior. The remaining mutants led by Professor X(Patrick Stewart) & Magneto(Ian McKellen) decide to transport Logan/Wolverine's(Hugh Jackman) consciousness to his younger self, 50 years to the past in 1973, to prevent a cataclysmic event that causes the creation of the Sentinels. They do this, with the help of Kitty Pryde's(Ellen Page) phasing powers. Here, Wolverine meets, Charles Xavier(James McAvoy), Erik Lensherr(Michael Fassbender), Hank/Beast(Nicholas Hoult), Raven/Mystique(Jennifer Lawrence) & a few others. With the help of his fellow mutants, Wolverine has to stop this event by any means necessary, if there is any hope left for the future. <br/><br/>X-Men: Days of Future Past is a brilliant film. There are absolutely no flaws. The special effects are outstanding. Director Bryan Singer returns with a bang! Singer effortlessly maneuvers with his massive star cast. All the major players get equal screen time. Days of Future Past is not just a movie with a lot of spectacular action set-pieces. It is an action movie with an emotional core at its center. The encounter between the two Charles of the movie, is worth the ticket price alone. The performances in the film are awe-inspiring. Hugh Jackman is outstanding as Logan/Wolverine. Jackman portrays a subdued Wolverine this time around, as opposed to the animal-like nature of his character. This is because the situation called for it. Since Wolverine has to unite all the mutants, Jackman can't go ballistic for no reason! James McAvoy is spectacular as Charles Xavier. McAvoy portrays a damaged & scarred Charles, effortlessly! For me, McAvoy is the standout performer of the entire film. Michael Fassbender is amazing as Erik Lensherr. Fassbender shines yet again, as the mutant anti-hero. Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant as Raven/Mystique. Lawrence easily switches from the innocent Raven of First Class, to the vengeful Mystique of Days of Future Past. Halle Berry is impressive as Storm. Nicholas Hoult is great as Hank/Beast. Ellen Page is awesome as Kitty Pryde. Peter Dinklage is awe-inspiring as antagonist, Dr. Bolivar Trask. Shawn Ashmore is good as Bobby/Iceman. Evan Peters is hysterical as Peter/Quicksilver. Josh Helman is effective as Maj. Bill Stryker. Daniel Cudmore, Bingbing Fan, Omar Sy, Adan Canto, Booboo Stewart, Lucas Till & Evan Jonigkeit are impressive as Colossus, Blink, Bishop, Sunspot, Warpath, Havok & Toad, respectively. Mark Camacho is great as President Nixon. Last but definitely not the least, thespians, Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen are legendary as Professor X & Magneto. X-Men: Days of Future Past is a must watch. Keep up the good work, Bryan Singer. I can't wait for X-Men: Apocalypse."
"Orxan","6","1","3","25 May 2014"," Expected but highly overrated
","I usually do not write reviews. The feeling that urged me to write is not the one of admiring the movie above all and let the world know about it. It was not a dislike neither, because I enjoy X-men movies since the possibilities with characters are just immense. No, what pushed me to write is that sense of enjoying a film but seeing that its being highly overrated.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a summer blockbuster so no need to be too harsh on that as long as it entertains and doesn't make you check your watch. And yes, this was probably one of the best among all X-men movies for all the reasons everybody says but somehow fails to specify.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie had some serious plot wholes and left some extraordinary characters untapped. It was an injustice to the work that had been done in the First Class on introducing the depth of Erik and Xavier's characters. It also had some very flat quotes, especially Xavier's lines were quite poor, and not even mentioning the JFK related ones... The movie should have been 30 minutes longer to better set the tone and give it the drama and epicness it deserved because, hey, does one have to remind how Dramatic and Epic changing history and saving the entire world is?<br/><br/>At the end, it was merely an entertaining action movie with a lot of very cool characters (who could possibly not love that Quicksilver character?!) but no depth, unless you already know the whole story and try to imagine that part yourself.<br/><br/>Being the best X-men movie ever done does not make it a great movie, considering the low it came from - not doing it better than the X3 would have been a disaster. I give it 7 points because it was very entertaining but could have been done much better."
"shrey5","10","1","3","25 May 2014"," Well, This is a whole new level!
","The 7th movie in the X-Men franchise, X-men Days of Future Past, is a Major and Fresh entry in this Dying Franchise, X-men is a the oldest on going franchise of superhero movies. The X-Men series lost its touch since the X-Men : The Last Stand, which was a major disaster, including the stand alone spin-off movies of Wolverine, the franchise started sinking, until X-Men First Class came, which served a origin story or Prequel for the whole franchise, and was a success. Now Days of Future Past continues the story from both ""The Last Stand"" and ""First Class"". Based on the Comic Book with the same name, the movie stays loyal to the Comic book story line to some extent.<br/><br/>The Movie Starts with the Dystopian future where machines named ""Sentinels"" have started a war against Mutants and Humans who help Mutants, Most of the X-Men have died and only few are left, and the only way to stop the war is going back to past and change the course of history. So Wolverine is sent back and the struggle to change the past for saving the future begins.<br/><br/>The future part of the movie has a very dark tone, The fear of sentinels and their power to destroy the mutants can be felt all along, the viewer also feels the fear knowing how strong the sentinels are, whereas the Past portion is kind of normal and fun, yes ""Fun"" ,there is Humor in the Past portion.<br/><br/>The Biggest USP of the Movie is the Characters, all the ""Alive"" characters of the Franchise united, that is fun to watch,personally i was excited about watching Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman sharing the screen together after such a long time. Jennifer Lawrence, Micheal Fassbender, James McAvoy, Halle Berry were a treat to watch. Again as i always have said that i focus on characters of the Film. But Peter Dinklage was wasted in the movie, his Character ""Bolivar Trask"" , the creator of Sentinels was unclear and confused.<br/><br/>The characters of the film are very well used, all the mutant's powers were shown effectively and each of them had something important to do in the movie, but 1 character literally steals the show, ""Quicksilver"". When the character posters were revealed , ""Quicksilver"" was highly criticized and hated by all,because of his look in the movie, but as it turns out, he has the best scene in the whole franchise till date, setting an example of , do not judge a book by its cover, or do not judge a character from his poster! Professor Xavier or Professor X, both the future one and past one have a vast difference between them which is shown quite well , Magneto too had many different sides of him, he is evil but has respect for his best-friend too, personally Micheal Fassbender is an Awesome Magneto, of-course cannot beat Ian McKellen but still pretty good. watching Hugh Jackman is always a pleasure, and Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique is a total Enjoyment, she is flawless! <br/><br/>Overall the movie is quite complicated as it has the time-travel element , but Bryan Singer did a great job by explaining it very well to the viewers, of-course there are some confusions at some point, but those can be ignored, i loved Bryan's ""The Usual Suspects"", but i hated him since ""Superman Returns"",cause he ruined it. But once again he Gained my trust.<br/><br/>The Action is really good, the visual effects, the action choreography is excellent, the action with sentinels is quite intense. Some scenes which moves the plot forward are very touching, Patrick Stewart's speech to younger Charles Xavier is quite emotional, the story moves in a fast pace, from the very start the act begins and movie already picks up speed without wasting any time, performances by the lead actors is very good, such big cast , the biggest cast ever assembled , if i say, is treated equally,and is important in the story as well. The blending of Future elements with Past Elements is done brilliantly.<br/><br/>So, X-Men Days of Future Past is definitely a Epic Movie, I personally loved the movie very much, as I am a fan of all Superhero movies, But the reason i loved the movie was the last scene , the last scene made me emotional, you will see why I am saying that, when you watch the movie, The movie worked as a reset button for the X-Men Franchise, giving high hopes to fans for Future Projects.<br/><br/>This is a Must Watch! for all the Marvel, X-Men fans out there, and if you are going to watch the movie, if you haven't seen any X-Men movies, you are going to have a bad time, so please watch all the X-men movies before going into theater, Please.<br/><br/>P.S : Please stay until the ""End-Credits Scene""."
"kconroy03","8","1","3","25 May 2014"," Overall a great film
","Always look forward to Xmen films as am a huge Marvel fan. Deliberately don't watch trailers as I feel they ruin the film, so had no expectations before hand. Cannot give a proper review without spoilers so I will just say that James McAvoy is a brilliant actor and Jennifer Lawrence is awesome as Mystique. For any Marvel fan it will be a fantastic experience - and the ending is surprising. Am looking forward to more in the same vein - really think that James is the perfect actor to take over from Patrick Stewart. He has the presence on screen to carry it off. One thing I must say is that this is first film for a few years that hubby and I have seen in 3D and it was amazing. 3D has come on leaps and bounds and it was like being IN the film.

"FilmMuscle","7","1","3","24 May 2014"," Finally an Exceptional, Genuinely Humane Superhero Film!
","It was not too long ago when everyone felt like X-Men's prospects, as a franchise, were very bleak following mediocre and downright atrocious installments like X3: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Once the universe's creative vision fell into foreign hands, it simply lost its once-coveted flavor, spitting in the face of character accuracy and logicality. (In my honest opinion X-Men Origins opened up strongly only to end with a fairly benign and ridiculously silly showdown.) After a couple of failures, 20th Century Fox fell into panic and attempted to find some way—any way—to revive the franchise, which led to the excellence of First Class. That film's compelling focus on Eric's and Charles' relationship , as well as setting the X-Men into the 60's made that film what it was. <br/><br/>Thankfully, we have that component of the 20th century returning to X- Men's latest adventure, Days of Future Past, where now the 1970's faces the dauntingly hostile machines called the Sentinels who are threatening the whole existence of mutants, thanks to a man named Dr. Trask (portrayed by Peter Dinklage) who has proposed this incredibly antagonistic method to dispose of people that apparently threaten mankind's way of life because they're ""different."" This means that Wolverine from the present (never explained but somewhere 50 years in the future) must travel back in time to reverse the events that led to the creation of these monstrous beings and therefore save the future for mutants and humans, alike. <br/><br/>What elevates this film to prestigious heights is its impeccable cast and the exceptional performances given by James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and of course, Hugh Jackman who's unbelievably charismatic as always. His humorous, mean-spirited approach to most situations keeps the story thoroughly entertaining, no matter what. I have no idea how the franchise will stand on its feet after Huge Jackman is done with the role and the obvious void which will be left thereafter. <br/><br/>James McAvoy exhibits the vastly troubled and heartbroken man Charles Xavier was in his past, spending his days mourning over the friends and students he's lost to his now-nemesis, Eric Lehnsherr (Magneto). McAvoy has definitely been one of my favorite actors who's been rising over the years since 2007's Atonement and proving his impressive range, and he's given the perfect role here—even more than First Class—to dig deep into the emotional side of Xavier whose self-esteem and hope for the future of his race truly suffers. <br/><br/>Being another favorite of mine, Michael Fassbender once again returns to reprise his role as Magneto, and man, is this rendition of Magneto a profoundly devastating villain—nearly unstoppable and scheming in his behavior. He often disguises his true intentions, mystifying his inner thoughts and making his next plan nearly unpredictable. As we remember, Magneto has accomplished numerous fake-outs throughout the cinematic series from his brief alliance with Xavier in X2 to his apparent innocence once reunited with his old friend, Charles, in this chapter. Unlike the generic villains that pervade Marvel Studios' films, Magneto once again showcases his formidable presence through his terrorizing powers, frequently overpowering everyone else in the room as long as he has his lustrous metallic helmet around. <br/><br/>Most powerful of all though is the returning extraordinary dynamic and interaction between these two former friends—Xavier and Magneto—more transparent here than ever before. On a related note, Days of Future Past is pervaded with humanity—that element of genuine human drama that's missing from superhero movies nowadays. It's what I love about First Class and this sequel: they seem so confident in their character- driven narratives rather than feeling the need to insert an intense action sequence between every other tamer scene. There were whole 15- minute scenes purely dedicated to emotion-ridden conversations, fleshing out the character's pasts (Eric's and Charles's especially) and whatnot, generating a prodigious amount of characterization that's all too rare in the genre. <br/><br/>With that being said, it's still not the perfect/flawless X-Men film. See, I generally abhor stories about time travel because you essentially know that they're going to tie up the ending as neatly as possible. So, even when characters in the future, past, or present die, you really don't care. You undoubtedly know history will rewrite itself and everyone will survive and the world will be restored to unmitigated peace. That element of unpredictability immediately vanishes, and at that point, the storytellers can bring back dead characters from the series' past and correct any tragedy throughout the entire franchise. It's frankly boring and creatively unfair, but of course, the crowd- pleasing aspect is a mandate in superhero movies at this point. <br/><br/>In addition, everyone who's read the comics, and this storyline in particular, has been hyping up the sentinels to be these unforgettable, baleful villains in the X-Men universe. But really, I felt like they weren't anything more than the standard threats of the week that simply came and went. In the end, Days of Future Past, while still leagues behind The Dark Knight's presence of brilliance in the superhero genre, is still far superior to any superhero film in the last three years. While the themes (of segregation/racism and fate vs. choice) aren't anything mind-blowing and subtle, this recent X-Men installment still contains that substance/cinematic value and promises a lot more for its future than the countless flicks Marvel Studios release every year."

Professor Xavier, Magneto, and Kitty try to stop this by sending Wolverine back to 1973 to change the future. The age-less, self healing Wolverine goes back because he seems most able to weather the taxing nature of time travel. His purpose is to stop Mystique, from assassinating the Sentinels' designer, Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage, who is Tyrion Lannister in ""Game of Thrones""), which she did in 1973. The government apprehended her, and used her extraordinary DNA to further empower the Sentinels. The rest is for you to discover, as I don't believe in spoiler reviews. This film rates 5 of 5 stars and I want to see it again soon!"
"vistheindian","9","1","3","24 May 2014"," Validating the entire franchise
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Director Bryan Singer, the godfather of all things X-Men (cinematically), returns to the franchise with its most ambitious film yet. In the future the world is in ruins and menacing robots called Sentinels are hunting both mutants and humans alike. The last remaining hope for survival is to go back in time and change history to prevent this dire future from becoming reality. To call X-Men DOFP a time- traveling comic movie is an injustice. This is a movie that goes beyond its genre norm and delivers a compelling character driven story. This is a must-see for all X-Men fans and everyone else.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>X-Men DOFP is incredibly well-directed with strong story-telling, obviously credit for that goes to Bryan Singer. He finally returned to the director seat after years of being just a producer, and he shows how an X-Men movie is done. Movies involving altering time-lines can be tricky to pull off, one wrong move and the story will just fall apart. Yet Singer manages to keep this aspect of the movie cohesive, showing both the past and future scenes with the right balance. He in fact goes an additional step and keeps the cohesion with the entire franchise (even the crappy ones, yes). By that I mean this movie recognizes and corrects the faults and plot holes of all the other movies. At first glance, X-Men is an extremely crowded universe, but you don't feel that at all. Every character is given the right amount of screen time and things to do to make you care about what is happening on screen. They are no longer just a random collection of mutants in peril. That brings me to the strongest part of X-Men DOFP, the characters.<br/><br/>I can honestly say there is not an ounce of weak acting from both the old and new main cast. However, majority of the film takes places in the 70s, so it is mainly the new cast from X-Men First Class that get to shine, and wow they shine bright. James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Jennifer Lawrence play their parts so well that you will only recognize them as their characters. James McAvoy is Professor X like we've never seen before, broken and tortured. You sympathize and understand the pain he has been going through. You recognize that Michael Fassbender as Magneto is flawed in his ideologies, where the end justifies any means. Still a small part of you supports his ways. When an actor can make you question your own moral stance, that's a sign of brilliance. Finally, Jennifer Lawrence brings to life the multiple dimensions and physicality of the character Mystique with grace. The biggest surprise is the newcomer Evan Peters as Quicksilver, with the ability of super speed. He steals every scene he is in, and I think it's best for you to discover by yourself what makes him so great.<br/><br/>I really had to think hard for any negatives, and I just could not come up with any. Some people I talked to think there was too little action, and in a way I can understand that. In the end, that didn't bother me because I was invested in the characters and their emotional interactions. Still, the action set pieces that are there, I found them to be fantastic (now merge this universe with the new upcoming 2016 Fantastic Four already!). The X-men franchise is known for some great and not-so great movies. It is not a perfect franchise. However, X-Men DOFP is one of the greats, and hell, it is close to perfection.<br/><br/>REMINDER: There is an end-credits scene, so do not leave after the movie ends."

","This review contains spoilers. There will be warning before each spoiler. This is my honest review and is my opinion, this does not mean it is the correct view if wish to disagree and debate my arguments I am willing to listen to other views. please be careful of spoilers. thnx. :) <br/><br/>I personally enjoyed this film I loved the plot, the characters, the actors and most importantly the acting. Compared other x-men films I have never been so hyped as I was for one of them But that was a big problem I will never do again. There are some minor problems for me. (This contains a minor spoiler)<br/><br/>First problem I had with the film is in the past there are too few x- men. This is a problem for me as I thought the X-men from the previous film X-men First Class (Havok, Banshee, Angel etc...) didn't get enough screen time in the film. This annoyed me because I thought they were going play bigger role and I thought it would have been better with them in it. <br/><br/>My second problem would be that there are simply not enough battles. This comes to be a rather annoying problem as I was expecting magneto and his followers, Xavier and the earlier gen x-men with a few sentinels. But the reality is that most of the film is talking, usual superhero film encouragement monologues and usual superhero disagreements.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Pro's: 1. Good plot 2. Good actors and characters (especially Jenifer Lawrence as mystique) 3. They managed to make a simple film out of complex concept. Cons: 1. Not enough battles 2. Not enough mutants 3. Ending felt like most other super hero films. 4. The film is over hyped. Please if you are really excited for the film I would tone down your expectations. I was mad for this film and I enjoyed it loads but the problems that I have pointed out (above)lower my rating.<br/><br/>(Note: I did point that this review may contain spoiler and there would be warnings but if you find one that I haven't pre-warned you of please don't hesitate to point it out so others don't have it spoiled.)"
"mynameisibrahim","7","1","3","24 May 2014"," Best X-Men yet
","The advent of the outstanding X-Men: First Class (2011) revitalized the franchise and enabled a new sequence of stories to be portrayed. Based loosely on the iconic comic of the same name, Days of Future Past depicts another astonishing story.<br/><br/>In a dystopian future, mutants are facing extinction courtesy of Sentinels, robots designed for the solitary purpose of obliterating mutants. In order to prevent such mass genocide of their species, Wolverine must travel back in time and alter history before everything unravels.<br/><br/>Adjacent to a fascinating narrative, the stellar cast is one of the movie's USP's. Days of Future Past features Oscar winners like Jennifer Lawrence and Halle Berry and franchise veterans such as Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. Furthermore, the eclectic array of thespians is completed by Michael Fassbender and the standout performer, James McAvoy.<br/><br/>Playing a desolate Professor X, McAvoy delivers a sublime performance. So often the major thematic thrust of the story, the central conflict between Professor X and Magneto is a recurring theme and provides excellent character moments between the two. The supreme dynamic shared by the duo is still intact.<br/><br/>The premise also allows an epic scope and features unprecedented action in the X-Men series. The sentinels provide a dominating adversary for mutants, which results in exquisite action sequences, both past and present.<br/><br/>Moreover, Days of Future Past also signals a return to form for director Bryan Singer, following his last outing in the comic book genre, the insipid Superman Returns. The X-Men represent some of Marvel's most enduring characters and this installment is an impeccable testament to that.<br/><br/>The writers also deserve an honorable mention: the difficult concept of time travel is handled well without glaring loopholes. Also, tying proceedings to actual historical events, such as the Cuban missile crisis in First Class is a masterstroke. The outcome is a more cogent and captivating story.<br/><br/>Yet another unique aspect of X-Men is its social relevance. It retains laudable cultural context and tackles universal themes of isolation and discrimination. The notion of mutants is an extraordinary way of providing societal commentary, pertaining particularly to racism and sexuality.<br/><br/>The latest chapter in the X-Men saga does have minor glitches though. The costumes or lack thereof, remain poor. Keen observers will also notice that the inconsistent timeline and continuity are in disarray as well. However, these represent only slight concerns and take little away from an otherwise pulsating movie.<br/><br/>Ambitious and engaging in equal measure, Days of Future Past is action packed, brimming with emotion and has the feel of a comic book come to life."
"rcolgan","9","1","3","24 May 2014"," 14 years in the making
","The X-Men film franchise was started in 2000 and was one of the first Superhero films of the modern Superhero renaissance. After that the franchise was running for 14 years creating sequels, prequels, one good spin off Wolverine film and one dreadful spin off Wolverine film. After watching Days of Future past, you really get the feeling that this is the film that the past 14 years have been leading up to, using all our favourite characters across the franchise and putting them against one of the greatest threats they could face in this masterpiece of a modern blockbuster. <br/><br/>It chose probably one of the best stories from the comics and is ideal for the franchise as it allows the film to use characters from both the original X-men trilogy with those from First Class. The film starts in the future, where the sentinels have almost brought mutants to extinction by hunting them and killing on sight, immediately establishing the potential for the dark drama of the film. In a final resort, the last surviving members of the X-Men attempt to send Wolverine into the past so he can unite the young Xavier and Magneto to stop Mystique whose powers inadvertently caused the creation of the sentinels to begin with. <br/><br/>One of the new characters in the film is Quicksilver who is a great character dominating most of the time he was on screen with his funny and fast paced nature creating some of the best laughs of the film, with one scene seeing him literally getting one of his enemies to punch himself in the face. Another impressive addition is Peter Dinklage as Trask who creates the sentinels and is arguably one of the lead villain of the plot. Just like Magneto, he honestly believes what he is doing is right. By doing what he believes is best for humanity and not recognising how sinister his actions can be he becomes a more interesting character.<br/><br/>But the focus of the film does remain on the main characters of the franchise. For example the leading character of the film is Xavier. Just like First Class was an origin film for Magneto and why he created the Mutant Brotherhood, this film shows how Xavier got over his darkness and chose to follow a brighter path to form the X-men. We also see Magneto return and get to see two contrasting relationships between him and Xavier. Their past selves who hold great resentment to each other and their future selves who are close friends and regret the conflicts of their past. There's also Hugh Jackmans Wolverine where we see a different version of the characters to the previous films. He has some funny moments, but the overall performance is far darker being changed by the previous films and the bleak hopelessness of the future. <br/><br/>But with so many great characters I can only mention so many. So I will just say that each of them have a distinct personality that drives their actions. It also feels like each character is there for a good purpose, having some impact on the plot. To top this off, many of the characters are being played by some of the best acting talent of recent times with the entire cast being real acting heavyweights and bringing their full talent to each role.<br/><br/>The film is also very well made, with X-men veteran Bryan Singer returning for directing duty. He uses two significantly different styles for both the future and the past. All the future scenes are shot in a darker way with less colour as a reflection of how bleak the future has become, emphasised even further by the ruins that we see our characters survive in. The 70's on the other hand contrast to this with it's busy city streets and detail of recognisable traits from the decade with the likes of water-beds and the lack of more than 3 channels creating regular chuckles but also being a great setting for all the dramatic scenes too. <br/><br/>Singer also does well as an action director for the film. Whilst some people did complain that the first 2 X-men films were at times too light on action, I doubt anyone will be saying the same of this film, as it contains some of the best fight sequences of the X-men franchise thus far. Not only are they well made, but also they vary greatly from Wolverines brutal fights to the more VFX heavy attacks of Magneto. But luckily these impressive fight scenes never draw any attention away from the story or characters within the film, with the plot leading to fight scenes instead of the fight scenes leading the plot.<br/><br/>The only single thing that stops this film from getting a 10/10 for me is the fact that I don't think we saw enough of the future. It would have been interesting to have seen more of how these characters have been surviving with the Sentinels attacking or just how they met up with one another to form this plan. However I do hear that there were some future scenes filmed, such as an entire sub plot with Rose, but was cut for time purposes. So hopefully there will be more of the future seen in the DVD release. <br/><br/>Besides, this is in itself mostly a minor nitpick for such an epic film. It is a masterpiece in every sense, with brilliantly directed fight sequences being amongst the best of the year and the franchise, genius writing which takes one of the best X-men stories and uses it to the full potential it can achieve and an incredible cast who juggle the difficult mixture of comedy, drama an action perfectly. Now we just have to wait another two years and hope that Apocalypse will match the brilliance that this film contained."
"michael-sengwah","9","1","3","24 May 2014"," Best installment in X-Men franchise
","X-Men is the only special superheroes franchise that is brilliant enough to make its installment to act as sequel and prequel at the same time. Bryan Singer has successfully turned it into ten times bigger that what Avengers has done, by gathering all of the great characters and separate them with balanced characters developments. It is definitely one of the best screenplay since The Dark Knight trilogy, which utilise time travelling at best to deliver the finest and most emotional installment ever in the franchise with well combination of humors, thrillers, cool actions, great effects and amazing yet powerful scores. Hope and faith are two essential inspiring elements in the film that it ends just in perfect."
"rickfletcher28","9","1","3","24 May 2014"," Yes there are holes and errors, but I can look past them and so can you.
","In a whole, this production was much better than X1 X2 and X3. The fight scenes in the future are well detailed and where I wish they would base it off more by the comics rather than just by how they feel the characters would behave, I still found myself enjoying the story and liking the new and old characters. I never would have expected seeing Professor X in that state of being after being shot in the spine, so it was nice to see him more human rather than just a super powered mind reader. I hope you guys go to this movie with as much excitement as I had going into it, and keep an open mind that it's not going to be perfect but it is going to be really good despite it's faults."
"kurtreyn","10","1","3","24 May 2014"," Greatest X-Men movie yet! Maybe best Marvel movie yet.
","It, for the most part, stays true to the comics. There are a few discrepancies. But, even the 90's cartoon everyone loves altered the story a little.<br/><br/>The acting was phenomenal. The mutant powers shined. The threat felt real. There was just enough of a blend between some well placed jokes and high level tension to balance the film.<br/><br/>For those concerned about continuity, DoFP does an excellent job of tying all of the X films together. It does lead to the possibility of alternative universes, but, so does every comic ever made.<br/><br/>In short, this is a must see. -From a lifelong X-Men/Marvel fan."

"estebangonzalez10","9","1","3","24 May 2014"," The best film of the franchise, and perhaps the best superhero film after The Dark Knight
","""Are we destined to destroy each other, or can we change each other and unite? Is the future truly set?""<br/><br/>I don't know if I have the right words to explain how much fun this seventh film in the X-Men franchise truly is. Matthew Vaughn revived this franchise in First Class by taking us to the past and giving the film a much more emotionally dramatic tone, focusing on the relationship between Charles and Erik. The greatest thing about that film was the cast he was able to assemble with James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, and Nicholas Hoult leading the pack. At first I didn't know quite what to expect when I heard Vaughn was stepping down and leaving Days of Future Past in Bryan Singer's hands. On the one hand he was responsible for the success of the first two X-Men films, but on the other hand I was let down with Superman Returns. I guess I kind of forgot this man was responsible for the superhero genre revival (contrary to popular belief, it was him with the first X-Men film not Sam Raimi with SpiderMan which came out two years later) that has dominated movie screens for the past decade and a half. Singer hasn't lost his touch and he delivers an exhilarating and entertaining film worthy of being a blockbuster summer hit. It has everything you want from a blockbuster movie: fantastic visuals, great action sequences, a perfect ensemble cast, and a story that is both fun and emotionally engaging. I don't just want cool visuals and nice actions sequences, I want to be engaged with the characters and care for them, and that is what Singer pulls off beautifully with Days of Future Past. Add the wonderful performances from Fassbender, McAvoy, Lawrence, Stewart, Jackman, and a wonderful scene with Evan Peters as Quicksilver and you have a perfect movie. This might just be my favorite superhero film after The Dark Knight due to the fact that the cast is amazing and that Singer managed to perfectly blend the best aspects of the earlier films in the franchise with the new elements Vaughn brought to the reboot. It is hard to imagine how after 7 films, Days of Future Past manages to remain so fresh and keep the audience so emotionally invested in these characters. As we reach the halfway point of the year, I must say this is the best film of 2014 so far.<br/><br/>Based on the Days of Future Past comic book story arc written by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, the screenplay was adapted by Simon Kinberg. Set in an apocalyptic future, the few surviving mutants are struggling to fight together against sentinels created by humans to hunt them down. The few surviving mutants we see fighting in the first scene are Colossus, Sunspot, Bishop, Iceman, Warpath, Blink, and Kitty Pryde. There isn't much they can do against these sentinels that adapt and absorb their powers. Several mutants are killed during the attack, but then all of a sudden they disappear as we discover Kitty Pryde's (Ellen Page) mutation has evolved in such a way that she can send someone's consciousness back through time. By doing so they were able to send Bishop a few minutes back in time and warn them about the sentinel attack, thus altering the recent timeline and staying alive. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) know that the mutants are facing extinction and that in order to be saved they must return to the past and undo something Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) did in 1973. Along with Charles and Magneto, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) arrive to the place where the rest of the mutants are hiding out. Since Wolverine is the only one who doesn't age and who can fully recover, they decide he is the only one fit to return to the past and stop Mystique from assassinating Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), the creator of the sentinel program. His murder would only fuel human's hate towards mutants and lead them to perfecting his work through experimentation with Mystique's unique DNA. Once back in the past, Logan must reach out to Charles (James McAvoy) and Erick (Michael Fassbender) and unite them in order to stop Mystique from achieving her goal and thus saving their future. <br/><br/>Time traveling can be a difficult and tricky feat to pull off, but by using a similar approach to other films such as The Terminator, Singer manages to turn it into a quite simple premise. He merges both timelines perfectly in a satisfactory way. The film feels genuine thanks to some wonderful performances, strong character development, excellent pacing, and the emotional risks that are involved. In a way, I felt like Days of Future Past followed the steps of its predecessor and fixed a lot of the problems audiences had with The Last Stand, thus reinvigorating the franchise without having to reboot it. The film is inventive, original, and there are plenty of surprises. I loved every moment Fassbender was on screen as he absolutely dominates every dramatic moment. Jackman's Wolverine was always my favorite character in the X-Men franchise, and he is fantastic, but this time he has a lot of help from the rest of the cast. McAvoy also adds a lot to the emotional dramatic effect of the film on the viewer. The scene he is confronted by his future self (Stewart) is impressive. His character and Fassbender's are complete opposites despite the fact that they truly respect and care for each other. Lawrence's Mystique seems to be at the center of their struggle. All these elements combined with Singer's breathtaking visuals turn what could've been just another conventional superhero film into an epic one. Singer also knows how to balance action with dramatic moments along with some comedic ones."

","WHAT.A.REDEMPTION for Fox! My initial thought: the first 10 minutes of a movie is supposed to be attention grabbing. Well, I thought too soon (first 2-3 minutes sucked). Adapting Sentinels ... whose brilliant idea was that? There really would have been no hope whatsoever for mutants. Why does the actress that plays Kity Pryde look so old? I hope everyone that sees this film takes note of Hugh Jackman's naked body! The man is FORTY FIVE years old! And that is what his body looks like. Raven Darkholme kept this movie exciting and action packed. Whoever thought to cast Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr should be paid a billion bucks! That man is amazing for his role! I was NOT impressed with Evan Peters being casted as Quicksilver, but to my surprise, he did an outstanding job. I just wish they didn't have his hair so stiff. The long hair on James McAvoy was extremely appealing. The whole time, I'm wondering how the hell is he walking and how does Beast look like his human self? DUH!! I clearly neglected to remember the far reaches of Hank McCoy's intelligence. The ending: what a NICE surprise!! Make sure you stick around for the after credits scene."

The Avengers of Marvel Studios I would say! Jennifer Lawrence shows that she is truly a gem, who can acts and fights too! Michael Fassbender as usual, acts with style while James McAvoy continues his outstanding performance since I first saw him in Wanted. Peter Dinklage act of coolness in this movie could't escape my comparison of him as Tyrion Lannister.

I don't want to reveal too, too much for those that have not seen this movie, but I will say thisPatrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellan, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry – you brought the past into the future – you guys are the epitome of great acting. To the newbies – James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence (J-Law), Nicholas Hoult, and a slew of new mutants – everything was just superb in every single way.<br/><br/>The movie defines what we should be in our future, not define us what we were once in the past.

"griffolyon12","9","1","3","23 May 2014"," This One is for the Fans!
","In X-Men: Days of Future Past, the stakes have never been higher for our heroes and villains. They are literally facing annihilation, unless they can change and overcome their past. <br/><br/>The film starts in a post-apocalyptic future where the cast of the original three X-Men movies (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, etc.) are all that are left after mutant hunting robots, called Sentinels, have killed most mutants on the planet. Utilizing the super powers of Kitty Pride, Professor X decides to send Logan back in time to 1973, to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from assassinating a key figure, which ultimately led to the creation of the future the X-Men are facing. It's a mindbending storyline for sure, but it all works beautifully, flowing gracefully between the past and the future with a logical ease that is missing in many time travel movies.<br/><br/>From the very moment this film was announced, fanboys have been rabid in their anticipation, and this film doesn't disappoint. The filmmakers figured out how to give the original X-Men cast a proper send off, while making a sequel to the 2011 prequel, X-Men: First Class, at the same time. Plus, the time travel nature of the story has enabled them to wipe out some of the continuity mistakes of the previous X-Men films to rectify many of the stupid decisions made in films like X-Men Origins: Wolverine or X-Men: The Last Stand. This film was clearly made by fans, for the fans, and the fact that it's also just an exceptionally well made blockbuster is the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>There is a lot of action in this film, with more mutants and more super powers featured than in any previous X-Men movie. Every action scene was thrilling and satisfying, and there are many fan service moments here. However, the greatest aspect of this film is that it isn't your typical superhero flick.<br/><br/>Usually, the first question people have about superhero movies is: Who is the bad guy? In Days of Future Past, while there are the Sentinels and their creator, Bolivar Trask, the real villains of the story are our heroes themselves. The problems they are facing are all based on the choices and mistakes they made in the past, and it's about their past selves having to face up to what they will become in the future to overcome their own pasts in order to write a better future for mutants and humanity. It's in this focus on overcoming your past, that gives Days of Future Past an emotional weight that blockbusters often lack in the modern era, and if you're a long time fan of the series, there are moments in this film that will not only make you laugh and want to cheer, but will also move you deeply.<br/><br/>I can't do anything other than highly recommend X-Men: Days of Future Past to anyone who considers themselves an X-Men fan. While people who aren't quite as well versed in the franchise might find themselves lost given the vast amount of characters, I still think the film is entertaining enough on its own accord that just about any moviegoer can have a good time here.<br/><br/>I give X-Men: Days of Future Past a 9 out of 10!"

Not too fast, a tad on the slow side..<br/><br/>I felt that a lot could have been done with Blink and Quicksilver , but they hardly take the stage..<br/><br/>If you're a fan of just the movies , you may like it<br/><br/>But it you're a follower of X-men - the comics, the story lines ,the characters - then you might not see much in this film<br/><br/>And also,don't bother staying for the post credits scene. .. Not worth it, trust me...<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD! Don't READ FURTHER IF YOU Don't WANT SPOILERS !!<br/><br/>This movie has so many unanswered questions!! How does kitty get her powers? What are these new mutants names, or any indication of what they could do<br/><br/>How is the old Charles back??<br/><br/>And they screwed up time lines as well! How can William Stryker be 55 in the first movie, and 35 in the second , which is held 10 years later? And how does the original time-line exist,if the sentinel time-line took place?!<br/><br/>Its riddled with plot holes plot holes... <br/><br/>Lets hope X-men :Apocalypse can fix that."

","I don't know if it's just me, or X-Men franchises has been overplayed since First Class, or maybe even prior to that. All I know is that Wolverine's badassness has been quite overplayed to the point that it became boring to see Hugh Jackman with that wolfy sideburns and fork hands.<br/><br/>I actually wanted to elaborate it with a long narrative text, but it might become as boring as Wolverine. So, I'll make it simple.<br/><br/>*SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>First thing that annoyed me most is that too many anomalies for a franchise that's supposed to stand in-between First Class and its predecessors. It's as if all those stories were all afterthought just for the sake of prolonging the franchises. Here's my list of those anomalies that I found rather annoying and raised too many question marks for my likings:<br/><br/>One, Xavier's supposed to be limp, but the producer knew that people wouldn't want to see the oh-so-good-looking James McAvoy sitting around on a wheelchair throughout the movie. Badass protagonist should stand side-by-side with his equally badass partner, or face- to-face with his equally badass enemy. So, here comes the so-called medication for his spine.<br/><br/>Two, Xavier's way too invincible. Well, who wouldn't if you have telepathy and super-telekinetic power to even control the time? The producer surely realized it and toned down his character heavily. So, here comes the so-called side-effect.<br/><br/>Three, Mystique's the rogue, strong-willed, one-man-army femme fatale... where the hell did that come from? Wasn't Mystique supposed to be loyal to Magneto in the prequels? People changes, sure, but I think the producers were more considering about Lawrence's popularities in her role as Katniss and kinda overplayed this. So, here comes the rogue, strong-willed, one-man-army femme fatale.<br/><br/>Four, the producer thought that too many unimportant and less-badass characters like the poor Azazel or Banshee (which, unfortunately, weren't as good-looking as Summers and McCoy) , and they got rid of them... just like what? Like photos in a specimen report? I liked Azazel, though. And whatever the deal with the girl with power just like Banshee?<br/><br/>Five, Magneto was imprisoned in a bunker prison with advanced security and plastic bullets. Whatever happened to the less-advanced prison where the older-Magneto was held captive in X2?<br/><br/>Six, is it just me, or the technologies in X-Men franchise are becoming more and more advanced every time newer franchise's out. Like technologies in X2 were more advanced than that in X-Men, and The Last Stand was more advanced than its prequels. And First Class was even more advanced, which was supposed to set prior to the other three. And then they have these plastic transformers in Days of Future Past? What the heck...?<br/><br/>Seven, Sentinel is T-1000 as in The Terminator. No further comments needed.<br/><br/>Eight, what was Kitty's power again? I thought playing with time was Xavier's forte? Can anyone please explain?<br/><br/>Nine, All those machine guns and no dead bodies? Please, is this Disney?<br/><br/>Ten, (for me) ""changing the past"" is the worst solution a writer could ever think of. S/he might be wanting to prolong his/her story, or already running out of idea for solution. ""Going into the future"" sounds less-confusing than ""changing the past"", seriously. Whenever I watch movies that revolves around ""changing the past"" theme, I'd always think of what becomes the today's world once the history has changed? Perished like dust, then replaced with the already-changed- history version of today's world?<br/><br/>Okay, this could go on forever if I continue on with this. All those point I wrote were mostly taken from the first half of the movie. I could write a book if I list every anomalies in the entire movie. You should watch it yourself and see my points, or so I hope.<br/><br/>Overally, I enjoyed X-Men; Days of Future Past as some mindless-but- cool action movie, nothing much. If you don't wonder much about various unnecessary details, and if you haven't watched the prequels, you might find yourself happy that you've watched it. But if you do wonder about various unnecessary details, and at some point have watched the prequels, you might find yourself confused throughout the movie."
"Kop_Reaz","6","1","4","12 November 2014"," Very cleverly executed, THUMBS UP
","I was reluctant to watch this film. Because the previous movies frustrated me a lot. But this time I am glad I watched it. Probably because I finally accepted this series will never climb above 8 stars in my book.<br/><br/>The movie stands strongly for itself alone. But when I try to connect all the movies from this series, everything collapses.<br/><br/>It's a superhero movie so I can't criticize the acting. Visual effects were good. Not stunning, I repeat not stunning. There was one particular quicksilver scene that everyone talks about. It was a brilliant scene. But not because of the visual effects. Yes, definitely not because of the visuals but for the cleverness. (Note to DC: your Flash better be better)<br/><br/>The movie have clear plot holes and unscientific stuffs. But I can't blame the movie for them. It's because X-Men is originally a comic books series. But still when someone transform a comic into a movie, it's his responsibility to make it believable. 'Cause motion pictures don't have the liberty to get away with illogical stuffs. They have to be believable. Yet I enjoyed the entire 2 hours of this film.<br/><br/>I liked the cast very much. Finally a X-Men movie with Wolverine, where the focus is not on Wolverine. It was nice to have the old X-Men casts and the new ones in the same film. <br/><br/>Final Verdict: 68%. Very cool movie. Definitely the best X-Men movie. But my negligence for this franchise got increased a bit."
"Wuchakk","9","1","4","5 October 2014"," Focuses on the best characters and an interesting story
","""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014) starts in an apocalyptic near-future where mutants are being wiped out by Sentinels, government-made robots created for this very purpose. The X-Men and Magneto decide to send Wolverine's consciousness back to his body in 1973 to prevent the Sentinels from attaining their mutant-killing powers.<br/><br/>This is easily one of the best X-Men films because of the interesting plot and the focus on the most interesting characters. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) has been the top X-Men since day one so you can't go wrong with making him the focal point. James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart are excellent as Professor X, as are Michael Fassbender as young Magneto, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique and Evan Peters as Quicksilver, the latter in a small but highly entertaining role. Nicholas Hoult as Beast gets an honorable mention and Bingbing Fan is notable as Blink, particularly her stunning face.<br/><br/>The plot is convoluted and yet easy to follow if you're familiar with the franchise's story arc. The film is all-around compelling. It has the confidence to slow down and be pensive while throwing in the requisite thrills and not forgetting to be entertaining. For instance, the creative and amusing way Quicksilver takes down a bunch of security guards at the Pentagon, which is one of the movie's top scenes. Lastly, I like the way Magneto's great power is illustrated (you'll see what I mean).<br/><br/>The film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes and was shot in Québec, Canada.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"

"CrisMovieCorner","10","1","4","15 July 2014"," Welcome back Singer!!!
","So after the last time Simon Kinberg wrote an X-Men movie, and obliterated all we love in ""The Last Stand"" I was extremely worried that he had signed on to write ""Days Of Future Past"". All I can say is ""welcome back Bryan Singer!"".<br/><br/>You're off to a good start when the incredible voice of Sir Patrick Stewart begins the movie setting the tone of this dystopian world in which mutants are living. The 2023 apocalypse is upon them in which Sentinels are out to kill of mutant kind, and they incorporate the great idea of sending Wolverine back in time to 1973 in order for him to help save the First Class team and mutant kind alike.<br/><br/>Upon arriving back in 1973 is extremely clear that Professor X (McAvoy) is in a pretty bad way, becoming a social recluse hiding away since the Cuban incident which left him paralysed with now having Beast (Hoult) help look after him. While Mystique is off on her merry mission to try and kill the creator of aforementioned Sentinel creator Bolivar Trask (Dinklage) an assassination that is set to escalate Trasks Sentinel programme.<br/><br/>I don't really want to delve anymore into the story that they go with in the movie, it is that good I would rather you watch it yourselves to get deep in the story, it is that phenomenal. There is some scenes that will blow your mind! I will say there may or may not be a scene when Charles meets Charles, you have to see it to believe it. But the scene stealer goes to Evan Peters, he went from a casting we ALL laughed at, to stealing the whole film in this one scene.<br/><br/>In conclusion the movie is a masterpiece, not only is it an overly great Superhero movie it also holds its own against the biggest movies of the year. Not only was it one of the best movies of the year, for me it is one of the better releases in recent years. A thoroughly enjoyable watch, for Marvel fans and none comic book fans alike. Singer was completely on point with this movie, it was a very ambitious project yet he delivered in the biggest way."

"lesleyharris30","9","1","4","14 June 2014"," The Best X-Men Yet By Far,
","X-Men: Days of Future Past is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast and characters. I would say this movie is by far the best X-Men in the series yet, it brings the original cast with the prequels with the element of time travel, which is something I always love in films, it's a complicated and well structured storyline that you need to keep following or you'll get lost. The only aspect of this film that left me disappointed was that the young and older members don't really end up meeting, Hugh Jackman meets them all and there is a scene between James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart, but other than that no other young X-Men meets their older self, I was really hoping to see Michael Fassbender and Ian McKellen, that would have brought a big smile to my face, but sadly that never comes around. The cast is fantastic and very powerful here and the special effects are out of this world, there are many beautiful action and fighting sequences that are simply beautiful, it's great to see Bryan Singer back at the directors chair, he really understands this franchise and I think he is one of the only people who could give a story as complicated as this justice and make it as straightforward as possible for audiences, particularly Quicksilver's scenes which looked very hard to film, but he did a stellar job and it is an absolute delight to watch. Action packed and will keep you at the edge of your seat, fans of X-Men will not be disappointed and I would recommend X-Men: Days of Future Past to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. <br/><br/>Wolverine travels back in time and teams up with Charles Xavier, Magneto and Beast in order to stop Mystique from causing an event that has a huge effect on the future of mutants.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Hugh Jackman"
"heidee7","8","1","4","2 June 2014"," Probably the best X-Men movie so far
","This is probably the best movie in the X-Men franchise. There is a great plot that brings the two worlds (past and present) of the X-Men movies together which means there are a whole bunch of cool characters whose amazing powers are beautiful to watch, especially in tandem. The special effects and fight scenes are awesome and well executed. It has a stellar cast as well, which includes my favorites Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, and James McAvoy.<br/><br/>It also has the most hilarious scene I have ever seen in any X-Men film; it involves the character Peter (aka Quicksilver). He is in the film for just a short time but he was such a scene stealer (the same way he steals everything else, I now realize). The other scene stealer is Raven (aka Mystique) who has really amazing combat moves. Like, woah.<br/><br/>The plot was based on a famous comic book story with the same name, but they had to make some adjustments in order to make it fit with the film universe. For example, in the comics, it was supposed to be Kitty Pryde who gets sent back to the past, but the Kitty Pryde of the movies wasn't even born in 1973. So they realized that it would have to be Wolverine, because he has a mutant healing factor and longevity, which means that the same actor could play him in the past and the future.<br/><br/>That said, I don't think you need to watch the other X-Men films in order to enjoy this film, but if you did, it will definitely be more fun for you, as you can understand who the numerous characters are without having to resort to asking your seatmate or having to put up with her reacting to everyone with gasps, namedrops and background stories in hurried confusing whispers (I am the seatmate in this scenario, by the way). <br/><br/>You might want to stay put after the credits, as there is a short scene that shows a glimpse of what the next X-Men film will be all about."
"jitu935","8","1","4","25 May 2014"," X Men in Double dose
","I didn't had any expectation from the movie because I didn't knew what to expect from such a huge cast of talented actors in a superhero franchise. Any movie running simultaneously in two ages is difficult for both the audience and the director, but Wolverine guides us through it quite well. Although it had most of the mutants, but Wolverine, Prof X, Magneto, Beast and Raven has the most screen time. Rest are seen fighting the sentinels in the Future(or present if u say so). Talking about the sentinels(Future version) they were really the deadly mutant killing machine after the sentinels of the Matrix series, which were much more menacing. I may say that after the successful reboot of the X men series in X men First Class, X-Men: Days of Future Past continues the legacy. I had a good time watching it as I am crazy about these kind of stuff and enjoyed the Sunday morning."
"RforFilm","10","1","4","24 May 2014"," With a great story of time travel, alternative history, super powers, and finding wisdom, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the smartest and best of the series.
","The idea that we could have an alternative is fascinating. If the multiverse theory is correct, in which there are an infinite amount of parallel universes, how many kinds of possibilities would you want to know. I love the idea of alternative timelines, given that when we make one choice, the alternative would have done the opposite. What would have happened if you never went out on your first date? What if you went to school in a different country? What if the smallest decision you made over a lunch break was actually a universal change that you would never have guessed?<br/><br/>In the world of fiction, especially fan fiction, it's interesting to see how our favorite characters would have evolved, given different circumstances. Alternative stories will usually happen when the original idea has its own flaws. The X-Men franchise has been given plenty of sequels, spin- offs and the recent X-Men: First Class that unfortunately causes this universe to be kind of messy. I like the X-Men, but I'll admit that X-Men: The Last Stand took a lot of directions that did not properly portray it's heroes and taking away ones that could have interesting. X-Men: Days of Future Past attempts to undo those actions.<br/><br/>This X-Men movie is both a sequel to the 2000 series and X-Men: First Class, blending the older actors with the new. It's not as complicated as it sounds. It starts in a dystopian future where robots called Sentinels have nearly wiped out the human race, hunting mutants and regular people. The X-Men have done their best to defend themselves, but both Professor Charles Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (played by Ian McKellen) know that the only way to stop this is to prevent the war altogether. With Kity Pryde's (played by Ellen Page) ability to send a person's consciousness back in time, Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) wakes up in his younger body.<br/><br/>Now in 1973, Wolverine travels to a younger Charles Xavier (played by James McAvoy) to discover a broken man and a mutant who has lost his powers in favor of a serum that allows him to walk. Wolverine persuades Xavier to join him to find Raven/Mystique (played by Jennifer Lawrence) and prevent her from killing the creator of the Sentinels, a brilliant scientist Bolivar Trask (played by Peter Dinklage). It all seems to go well, until they realize they need the cooperation of a young Magneto (Played by Michael Fassbender), who still seems bent on making mutants the superior race.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, I can say that X-Men: Days of Future Past is the smartest and most thought provoking of the X-Men series. The previous movies have ranged from being great to mediocre. Most of them felt like crowd pleasers, but this one really takes chances and had one goal in mind; to stop an event that may erase previous events before. Getting there is not a chore as it both gives us plenty to digest about the views on mutants and how one must find wisdom to make the right choice.<br/><br/>While this is an amazing X-Men story, this is not the most action orientated. Oh there's a lot of fighting, but most of the story is all about Wolverine working his way around 1973 and convincing younger characters that their older selves sent him there. Because it sacrifices superhero action to quality story, this may not be the ideal superhero movie for kids. What about non X-Men fan? Will they be able to enjoy this as much as I did? It's not a hundred percent necessary to know the X-Men, but it helps to know the situation their in. Give the franchise a skim before watching the best. You know what they say, save the best for last.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten Magneto helmets out of ten. The X-Men have gotten the movie they deserve, even if it won't please all audiences. I hope people will this this a chance, and they may find themselves becoming X-Men fans."
"WheelzFourReelz","9","1","4","24 May 2014"," Not only is this the best X-Men movies, but it may even be the best movie of the year so far.
","The X-Men has always been my favorite superhero group. It just has so many cool characters with awesome powers that really play off each other well. So, naturally, I was excited for this movie. I'm the kind of person that likes all of the X-Men movies. Yes, even X-men 3 and X-men Origins. Not only is Days of Future Past another great movie in series, it just so happens to be my favorite. This movie takes place after both X-Men 3 and X-Men First Class. I know, that's normally impossible, but you know, time travel. Anyway, the Sentinels have appeared and killed all the mutants. The team, including the villains of the story, rationalize that the only way to stop them from killing everyone is to stop Mystique from killing the head scientist guy from the past who built the things. Why they have to do this is explained in the movie. So Shadowcat, who can send people back in time in this movie, has to send someone back to convince young Xavier and young Magneto to help stop her, and Logan (Wolverine) volunteers. Is he able to save everyone in the past to make for a better future? This is the best synopsis I've ever done. I love the story in this movie. It's very well written and really makes you think. Normally, time travel plots will have plot holes in them and things that just make no sense. This movie does a great job filling those plot holes and making every aspect of the time travel element make sense. I also really like the characters. The characters are all well acted by their actors and have good chemistry between each other. Hugh Jackman still kills it as Wolverine. People might be tired of constantly seeing him in these movies, but he's too awesome for me to be bothered by it. James McAvoy is a fantastic young Xavier, Michael Fassbender is a fantastic young Magneto, and Jennifer Lawrence is a fantastic Mystique. However, Jennifer Lawrence's delivery on a couple pieces of dialogue seems dry. Not all of them, thankfully, but just a couple. This movie also introduced the character Quicksilver. I know, he was in the after credits scene of Captain America Winter Soldier, but in this movie, you really get to see him do stuff. And he is awesome! He's charming, he's funny, he's got an awesome power, and his hair design is just cool. And he is the central point of my favorite part of the movie. I'm not going to spoil it for you, because it's just too genius to be spoiled. The look of this movie is awesome. The movie is shot so very well and the special effects are absolutely stunning. The action is really exciting, intense, and fun. Lots of care was put into this movie, and it was so refreshing to see. And let's not forget the ending of this film. This ending is the absolute perfect way to end a movie. How the final throw down leads to this conclusion is just mind boggling. As I saw this, I was thinking to myself, ""Now that's how to reboot a franchise"". It's really awesome. If I had one nitpick, other than Jennifer Lawrence's few lines of stale delivery, is that the story has maybe a little too much. I mean, the story is about time travel, it's not going to be straight forward. Maybe if they took out a singular plot line, then it would've been perfect. I dunno, I just felt like the movie was giving me a little too much. However, I didn't really care. Overall, this movie was fantastic. It was everything I was hoping it would be and did not disappoint in any way. If you are a fan of Marvel, X-Men, or even the aspect of time travel, then watch this movie. This is one of the best that this year has to offer."
"arnieiam","9","1","4","24 May 2014"," Messy but still enjoyable
","I really love the first two movies. I really do. They were made during a different climate. Audiences are very used to comic book films now and their grandiosity but back then the first two films were very much contained. Therefore they had more subtlety and sophistication.<br/><br/>They were also directed by Bryan Singer, the genius behind one of the coolest films I've ever seen (KEYZER SOZE!) and it makes you wonder: where the hell was he in the last four films?!<br/><br/>And you an definitely see that he is now cleaning up the last four turds that were dropped on the franchise he built. Yes I even include First Class which basically butchered any discernible continuity and messed up all character arcs.<br/><br/>And the film messily incorporates all the elements of the preceding four and on top of that has to incorporate fan service, build the plot around CGI heavy set pieces and a gratuitous ass shot of Hugh Jackman's bare ass (shudder). Throughout the film I've had more questions than answers. The plot is all over the place that some characters are rendered useless, especially our favourite Wolverine, since he time travels to when he had bone claws.<br/><br/>However when you get past all that and go straight to the Singer elements that's when you appreciate it. The acting is still really good and the imagery and themes capture the pathos of the comics really well. Also the opening credits just like the first two with the DNA helix roller coaster, just awesome to see that again.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that this film series has seriously jumped the shark. But as a film with the basic metrics of acting, production value and emotion it is still very good. However for the love of god just give the rights of X-Men to Marvel studios, the same goes for Spider-Man."

","""So many battles waged over the years... and yet, none like this. Are we destined to destroy each other, or can we change each other and unite? Is the future truly set?"" Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart)<br/><br/>It's not set if you can, like Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), go 50 years back into 1973 and stop the creation of the Sentinels, Terminator- like robot warriors created by scientist Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), whose robots always defeat the mutants: ""From the beginning, the Sentinels were targeting the X-Men. Then they began targeting everyone."" (Wolverine)<br/><br/>So the plot of the exciting X-Men: Days of Future Past begins. The use of mutants in the Vietnam War, and the war itself, serve as a conflict backdrop to show the path to annihilation begun even without the help of Sentinels. <br/><br/>This iteration of a Marvel Comics hero collective is more complex and philosophical than its predecessors with new characters (mostly young versions of the X-men and women) that lend variety and interest and a measure of actor charisma. Besides the usual sturm and drang of robot arms like Gatling guns with eyes like beacons, this film has heart and humor as mutants and their leaders, Professor Xavier and his nemesis- now-bud, Magneto (Ian Mckellen), convene to send Logan back to convince their younger selves (James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender) to save surviving humans and sometimes to deal with misunderstood loves and friendships.<br/><br/>When director Bryan Singer and writer Simon Kinberg open with a moving shot of downtrodden mutants and sympathizers marching in unison, Fritz Lang's silent-movie Metropolis immediately comes to mind, and it evokes the theme of the oppressed waiting to rise up against the ruling class. Holocaust-like images of mutants and their sympathizers herded for internment camps chillingly reveal a doomed New York City.<br/><br/>The mutants are, after all, different, and in current conservative thinking, enemies of the good American life, lily white that is. As the various outliers, including the X-Men, fight for equality and against suppression, Hollywood again does a credible job of mixing imaginative action with contemporary lives of the disadvantaged.<br/><br/>Our heroes struggling with a vendetta-prone Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) adds interest to the usual survival motifs. She kicks butt with the best of them while she carries through her plan that actually dooms humans and mutants even more.<br/><br/>The cast is terrific, even if the story goes on too long, as the film moves thrillingly from a sober beginning: ""Mutants, we now find ourselves on the edge of extinction....""

The few surviving X-Men, in desperation, send Wolverine's mind back to his 1973 body in order to persuade Professor X and Magneto to prevent the incident which led to the creation of the Sentinels. Unfortunately, 1973 Professor X is a drunk depressive.<br/><br/>This film brings together the casts of the original X-Men trilogy and the First Class prequel in a loose adaptation of one of the classic story arcs from the comics. Placing fan favourite Wolverine front and centre, it tells a fairly dense story which centres mainly on the younger cast from the prequel. It deals with some of the continuity issues which arose due to the prequel (Xavier's paralysis) but not all of them (the different Emma Frosts in First Class and Wolverine: Origin are more or less forgotten), and creates some of its own (the teaser at the end of The Wolverine makes little sense as Xavier and Lensherr would not desperately need Wolverine's help at that point).<br/><br/>Who cares? The super-hero action is phenomenal, we see more mutants than ever before (some are blink or you'll miss 'em), and there is some heart and emotion - the key relationships between Xavier, Raven and Lensherr are addressed - and the story is perfectly satisfactory. Jennifer Lawrence is hot, deadly, blue, and sometimes quite moving, and all the principals give good performances. Worries about young P. Maximoff Esq prove groundless - he looks fine, his characterisation is terrific (if different to the comics), and he features n one of the stand-out set pieces.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this, and it is a worthy addition to the X-Men collection."

","Out of all the major superhero franchises we have today, the X-Men franchise has been the weakest in my opinion. I like the original two X-men films, First Class, and The Wolverine a lot. But in terms of the best overall franchise, it has never blown me away like other superhero movies had. But Days of Future Past is everything I had hoped and more. It brings together the original cast, and the younger cast from First Class together in one big epic movie. It also happens to introduce a few new mutants to the big screen that turned out to be more than impressive.<br/><br/>Right from the opening scene, you realize the franchise is back in Bryan Singer's hands who helmed the first two critically acclaimed X-men films. Literally the first 10 minutes show us the unique powers of some of the lesser known mutants such as Blink, Sunspot, and Bishop. Everyone's introduction was spot on and brings back the chills I had when first seeing X-men. The film then starts to set in motion the plans to send Wolverine's consciousness back in time to his younger self in order to stop Mystique from killing Boliver Trask. Jennifer Lawrence was great as both Raven and Mystique as you can tell she struggles to cope with everything bad that has happened to mutants the years following the Cuban crisis.<br/><br/>James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender once again shine as Charles Xavier and Magneto respectively. The two old friends go through many more ups and downs this go around, and you can tell how much more comfortable these actors felt in their roles. Ultimately this film is about hope, and which of the mutants can overcome their hatred and restore hope within the mutant community and together with humans.<br/><br/>Even though Hugh Jackman is once again the star of the movie, it's hard not to think about how good everyone else is in the movie. Evan Peters, as Quicksilver, who everyone including myself were bashing on how bad he looked in the trailers, was hilariously awesome in this movie. He had probably some of the best scenes of the entire movie by himself. Overall I loved this movie and it is by far my favorite X-men film, and one of the best superhero movies of all time.<br/><br/>I have to also mention the brief cameos of Cyclops and Jean Grey. It wasn't overly shocking, but I thought it definitely gave me butterflies knowing Bryan Singer found a way to bring them back.<br/><br/>+Quicksilver and the other new mutants <br/><br/>+Performances across the board<br/><br/>+those cameos......<br/><br/>+JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING <br/><br/>-left wanting more Rogue<br/><br/>10/10"

","Movie was great every second of the way. Tied together the past and present seamlessly and brought back many conversations from movies way way in the past full circle. Characters show sides of them that you never have seen before which is great to watch. Actions scenes are awesome and none feel forced or overdone. This is a must see X-Men/ Super Hero movie. I pray this does well in the box office so that we can continue to see awesome X-Men films be created. The movie leaves you excited and interested in what their next plan is. With the whole idea of both past and present characters having their own movies we could be in for a whole ton of X-Men films coming our way. The only knock I have on this movie is that staying till the end of the credits for the final clip is not worth it at all. This is the worst one yet. That is my only complaint thought. I never write any reviews but was compelled to do so this time. This was a 10/10."
"carmelsevillino","10","1","4","22 May 2014"," The Best Superhero Movie
","I have waited for this movie since I watched X Men The Last Stand and finally it happened. Even though X Men The Last Stand was a bad movie, I had to take a chance on this. ""Bryan Singer Comes Back To Freaking Direct"" and i am excited as I wonder how would he fix this wrecking franchise...............and well he did. It didn't actually fix it, the movies wasn't changed but he made an impossible feat making the 4th movie the best one yet and answering all the question the last 6 movies had left. If you aren't a big fan of this or you haven't seen all the previous movies I advise you not to watch it because it will displease you. This movie is meant for the X Men fans. Who makes a fourth prequel sequel movie on a wrecked franchise?, no one... except for Bryan Singer. With Matthew Vaughn's movie X Men First Class I knew that Bryan had ""HOPE"" (you would understand if you seen the movie)so he agreed to make off another movie interconnecting these the old wrecked trilogy with a successful prequel and well he chose the most cliché way and its time travel. ( Based From Days of Future Past Comics)<br/><br/>Don't mistake this movie like a Back to the Future sort of thing, changing the past to change the outcome of the future, this movie is like that on some way but it gives us more than any movie has to give. It gives us satisfaction nostalgia and relief, this movie gives as a remedy to stop regretting and stop thinking of the past on an unfinished trilogy with a devastating end. I believe everyone was devastated on X Men The Last Stand. Mystique Rogue Juggernaut Professor X Magneto Scott Jean Grey all died or lost their powers. Bryan Singer wants to finish it with a bang, something that many franchises failed miserably and many franchises failed to make, one example is the Sam Raimi's Spiderman Trilogy. And well Bryan Singer pulled it off.<br/><br/>The movies is set in the future where mutants are killed by Sentinels (with Mystique like powers) made by Trask who was killed by Mystique, 50 years ago which started everything. Wolverine gets sent to the past to change the future with the help of Kitty and the other surviving mutants. He wakes naked and starts finding Charles which is a total wreck. He was using the drug Hank made from X Men First Class to stop mutation thus making him walk but in exchange losing his mental powers. Wolverine tries to persuade him to stop Raven but he can't without Magneto's help. Magneto is locked in the pentagon for killing JFK. Wolverine and the gang tries to find Maximoff or Quicksilver to help escape his daddy which wasn't mentioned or showed explicitly in the film. He escapes then the group try to stop the assassination but Magneto the ""a""""hole"" fixes it his own way now wanting to kill Mystique. Its up to Charles to save the future. ( I won't spoil too much of the ending because reading it won't give it justice you need to watch this movie)<br/><br/>It isn't mind boggling like the Usual Suspects, It isn't a movie that was based on a single book like Shawshank Redemption, It isn't movie really interconnected to each other pretty well with the sequels and prequels like Godfather. It isn't perfect for God's Sake. So people don't try to make it complicated. If you like X Men: Watch it. If you don't like it: Don't watch it. If you haven't seen X Men movies or all of it then watch it first before you watch this to experience the full satisfaction, enjoyment, nostalgia and to fully understand it. The cameos of character like the older Hank, Rogue, Jean and Scott, the old actors and new actors from past and future reuniting in this Marvel movie seems fitting to end this franchise. I won't contradict if there will be a new one but his movie is enough to end this franchise. <br/><br/>Well ONe LAst THing, If you just gonna watch this just for Wolverine or any one X MEn then forget about it because you won't be happy. This movie showcases every mutant in equal ways so no highlights but Quicksilver is just steals the spotlight even in his short appearance."
"tcbently","10","1","4","22 May 2014"," The power is back on
","I don't usually like time travel movies (I get confused easily) but since I've seen all the previous ones in the franchise, I was able to follow things pretty well, despite the breakneck speed. The X-Men stalwarts of Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan and Halle Berry take a back seat, as their younger selves plus James McAvoy (channeling Stephen Fry) and Hugh Jackman re-arrange history to save the mutant race. The plot peaks with a slow-motion CGI scene where new stager Evan Peters (excellent) uses his super-speed skills to thwart Pentagon guards. There's humour too, as Bryan Singer has fun creating a sexy, sleazy 1970s vibe. I love the line when McAvoy gets Jackman to calm down by telling him he's had a bad acid trip! 1970s retro has been the rage with film-makers for a number of years but Singer handles it well and the detailing is perfect without tipping over into ridicule. Lovely performances all round, young and old alike. I'm a big big fan of Bing Bing Fan ;)"
"bornhard","7","1","5","8 May 2017"," Fattest Mystique, Casting Ruined Prequel to a Great Original X-men Trilogy, Reason I think for such bad casting choice inside the review.
","If you seen original X-men trilogy Rebecca Romjin personified Mystique perfectly any true geek could rave about it for hours how she was supple, agile, mercurial and rubber like she was imagined to be. Superhero movies like any other good fantasy fiction have to be best make believe as it can be especially each character. Here comes prequel movie series to original Classic X-men movies with The First Class and we get Fattest Mystique anybody could imagine Jennifer Lawrence, it was disrespect to the character. I mean how did she land the character in 1st place, she could never be the actor that would come to anybody's mind when imagining the cast. <br/><br/>Even let us say Jennifer Lawrence comes to audition how could somebody of her physique would pass the audition, what did she do for casting folks to overlook the main aspect the character. Only thing that comes to mind would be casting couch which Hollywood biggies don't like to talk about and boy she must be really good at it too. If you seen the movie she in pure Mystique form she looked more like somebody who ate Mystique rather than the supple mutant, considering she was also actress who played main lead in "" The Hunger Games"" around same time didn't seem to one prepared for that. Sorry if you think I am being disrespectful but as a absolute geek I was hurt when they disrespected the character by that casting choice. Even the best way she used to show Mystique's physical ability herself without a body double was by doing that side squat bend like if you remember when she did when she was on table in Paris hiding behind Xavier from Magneto.<br/><br/>The height of Jennifer Lawrence worship is so extreme that the complete story concept was changed, Mystique powers just mimicked to look like somebody not take their powers. So same way the sentinels made from her DNA wouldn't be powerful with powers but just mimics. Now that was big goof but now the director knew that therefore made a Rogue Cut.<br/><br/>This all really ruined the movie for me cause like I said before Superhero movies all the actor must look the character more so than any other movie type. Some folks might argue she is acts well but they surely could find somebody who acts well and actually would fit the look and physique. I do appreciate she slimmed down a lot by third installment of the movie series but then there were even worse casting goofs in that movie.<br/><br/>But since the movie is from amazing original X-men storyline and hence got a hit but would have been bigger hit if the makers had been sincere."
"louis-world-engine1","2","1","5","29 November 2014"," Some parts good, some parts bad.
","Everybody dies in a future that never happens. Some scenes don't make any sense.<br/><br/>However, some parts were brilliant such as when Raven is in the middle of the front garden of the white house and shoots Magneto. I also liked the character who was so fast he could appear to stop time. It is worth watching the movie just for that one scene.<br/><br/>The film involves time travel and is well written but near to the end most of the characters die in the future only for the past to change meaning they don't die after all. That part I found terrible. Don't let this review stop you watching the film though."
"blueskyy_ng","6","1","5","17 August 2014"," Good movie, however ratings here are overrated
","Okay, they've got a wonderful list of casts in there. Great acting, great special effects, great showcase of fictional characters, but... the only thing that's not so well done is the plot.<br/><br/>Time travel has always been a fascinating movie theme, one that's difficult to get right, because time traveling is a fantasy, it could NEVER be real, physics would not allow that. But, there are some fantastic time traveling movies -- Back to the Future (especially the first one) is a good example. X-Men: Days of Future Past, however is NOT. I'll just leave it at that.<br/><br/>If I were to compare this with the previous X-Men movies, this has got to be the least interesting one. This movie lacks focus. Okay, maybe Mystique was the focal point of the movie (character wise), but we didn't get to know her any better than we did going in, so that couldn't be it. The story was pretty generic, the only redeeming quality of this movie, that's new to its prequel, is the coming about of the sentinels.<br/><br/>To sum up, it's a good movie to be watching around with families, but if you step into the theater expecting a 8.5 or 9 movie, you'd be disappointed. Although you'll get to see all your favorite actors and characters, you'd leave feeling kinda of empty. Maybe a good meal would fix that up!"

","I loved the story, characters, action, everything. This movie is a real comic book movie, it is very close to its counterpart. Every character is unique, and contributes to the story in their own way, and trust me... There are a lot of characters in this awesome movie. This movie did a great job keeping me on the edge of my seat, it kept my heart racing, and my eyes glued to the screen. There are some very suspenseful and shocking scenes in this movie as well. You will laugh, cry, get mad, glad, sad, wish you had, and want to watch it over and over again. Overall this is one of the best, if not the greatest superhero movies ever made. Marvel all the way baby."
"callanvass","9","1","5","8 June 2014"," That's more like it!
","After being somewhat disappointed with X-Men: First Class, my expectations for this movie were normal. I expected an entertaining movie, but nothing more. I didn't expect such an ambitious and emotional installment. Right from the outset, I knew I was in for a wild ride, I just had that feeling. My gut instinct doesn't usually lie and it didn't this time around. Before I praise this movie thoroughly, I'll get one flaw out-of-the-way. If you're a huge X-Men fan, I don't recommend that you watch all the movies before this one. The continuity errors will drive you crazy. If you manage to brush that aside and block it out, more than likely you'll have a blast with this movie. With this sequel, everybody has so much more to lose. The stakes definitely feel way higher than before and I felt it emotionally. The post-apocalyptic atmosphere in the future is appropriately grim and extremely well done. I was also impressed with how they made 1973 look. I felt it mirrored the time period precisely. If you're craving action, this movie won't disappoint you. It's filled with tons of action for all the adrenaline junkies out there. Another thing I really liked was the presence of mutant killing machines. It made the odds seem insurmountable for the gang. The performances are excellent. Hugh Jackman is awesome as always. It was great to see Patrick Stewart in the franchise again. McAvoy & Fassbender are even more comfortable in their roles this time around. They were great as young Charles & Erik respectively. I felt they played off one another perfectly. Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as Mystique. Ian McKellen doesn't have as much to do, but it was nice to see him play a good guy. Halle Berry is completely wasted as Storm. She barely has any dialog and her screen time isn't that great either. Peter Dinklage added an interesting element to his part. Anna Paquin has a brief scene near the end. Page, Hoult, and Ashmore do what they have to do well. I won't spoil it, but there is a couple of cameo's at the end of the movie that made me grin. X-Men fans will definitely be pleased with the cameos. I liked the way they ended the movie. They tacked on a happy ending, but made sure it wasn't too contrived. <br/><br/>X-Men: Apocalypse is due next for this franchise. It will be interesting to see what direction they take. I was floored by this movie and I didn't expect to be. Not only is it filled with breathtaking action, it manages to be successfully ambitious at the same time. I really don't see how you can dislike this movie. It has a bit of everything and it's a must see! I'm glad I saw this in the theater<br/><br/>9.3/10"
"cosmo_tiger","10","1","5","1 June 2014"," Any other movies made will only hurt what has been done in this one. This is the best in the series & a great closing.
","""Just because someone stumbles and loses their way doesn't mean they're lost forever."" The human race has had enough of the mutants and they create Sentinels that can not be destroyed and only kill the mutant race. With their numbers dwindling and fearing for their own death Professor X and Magneto decide there is only one way to stop the genocide. They risk everything on an idea that if they send Wolverine (Jackman) back in time to stop Mystique (Lawrence) from killing the creator of the Sentinels then the war will not happen. He has to convince the young Professor and Magneto to work together to make this happen or the mutant race will cease to exist. I was never a fan of this series until I watched First Class. I loved that movie and decided to re-watch the others. After seeing them again I held firm that First Class was the best in the series by far. I had high expectations for this one and I have to say that I finally changed my mind. This one is easily the best movie in the series. It is rare for a comic book movie to have a fully fleshed out plot, character development and great acting all in one but this one did. This one felt like a legitimate movie with superheroes rather then ""lets see how many effects we can toss into this to make it look cool"". The movie was so well done and really combined the two generations together in a way that wasn't hokey at all. Even if you aren't a fan of comic book movies you should watch this. You will really enjoy it. Like I said after The Dark Knight Rises if the studio is smart they would close the book on this franchise because of the way this ended. Going any further will not only diminish the franchise but will begin to ruin what they have done with this movie. Overall, an excellent ending to the saga and if anyone with these movies cares about the franchise at all this will be the end of it. Any other movies made will only hurt what has been done so far. I give this an A+."
"utgard14","7","1","5","31 May 2014"," Just because the X-Men series stumbled and lost its path doesn't mean it can't be saved
","Great marriage of the first two X-Men films with First Class. Its primary function is as a sequel to First Class but it also works as a clean-up of the mess made with Last Stand. That the series has rebounded from that film and now ""fixed"" itself is surely a cinematic miracle. Hugh Jackman continues to be the backbone of this franchise. I really can't predict what will happen when he's too old to continue in the part and they have to recast. I'm not looking forward to it, for sure. Let's hope that is many years off. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen step back into their old roles seamlessly. Both are perfect as always. It was nice to see Halle Berry and the others return. The First Class crew (McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, Hoult) are all excellent actors and do well just as they did in that film.<br/><br/>The new characters are good, especially Evan Peters' Quicksilver, but it would have been nice if some of the old gang had been given more to do. I like that Storm and Iceman got some action and I understand why the others who appear at the end were only there briefly but poor Rogue was left to a two-second cameo. That's just sad when you consider how important she was to the start of this series. It would have been cool, considering the future angle, if they could have shown her for once being more like the Rogue from the comics. I think most fans would have gladly sacrificed a mort like Warpath to get that. I also shouldn't complain that Rebecca Romijn had no cameo considering she had one in First Class, but still it would have been a nice bonus. But these are minor quibbles with an otherwise very entertaining movie.<br/><br/>The special effects, action, and music were all well-done. The script was very smart and although I'm sure I could find some holes if I tried, the effort to keep a sense of continuity in this series despite its missteps is certainly appreciated. I was skeptical before the film for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that they were loosely adapting one of my favorite comic book stories and I didn't want to see it besmirched. What they wound up doing resembles the comic story only in name and using time travel as a plot device. Everything else is different. But I'm okay with that. I value the comic story for what it was and this for what it is. Bryan Singer's triumphant return puts him at 3-0 in X-Men movies. Hopefully he makes more of them as it's clearly material he connects with and is good at."
"JMT-Studios","10","1","5","22 May 2014"," Now This Is An X-Men Movie
","Fun, action packed, smart and engaging as they come. I enjoyed every second of this amazing movie, despite it having many time paradoxes. Though that comes with the territory of time travel movies.<br/><br/>So what's our story? The future has gone to all hell, sentinels have killed off nearly every mutant and have begun killing humans who may have mutant babies in the future. This all happens because Mystique killed the creator of the Sentinels, Bolivar Trask, which showed the government exactly why the sentinels were needed. So it's up to Wolverine to have his soul sent back in time to his ""younger"" body and stop these things from happening by bringing everyone together. <br/><br/>Now time travel is a tricky subject to work with and as a big fan of Doctor Who I paid close attention to it. Does this movie have some paradoxes? So many but the thing about paradoxes is that they keep people talking. This is a movie that me and my friends will be discussing for awhile. <br/><br/>How about the acting? To me the standout of this movie was Peter Dinklage as Bolivar Trask. I say this because he is one of the first people I've seen in a comic book movie that goes against the source material (Bolivar Trask isn't a dwarf in the comics) but make me not care about it at all because he's just that great of an actor. Now was he my favorite? No. He stood out the most to me but the character that had me smiling the most was Evan Peters as Quicksilver. He was just so much fun and had people in the theater cracking up. There's many characters that were only given very very minor roles. Though I understand because we don't want the movie too crowded. Everyone does great in their returning parts and the new characters, while being pretty under developed, still were really cool to me.<br/><br/>It's the perfect blend of action, humor and mutants to keep people young and old entertained. A must see for comic book and everyday moviegoers."

This is not an action movie, it is a movie with good plot. <br/><br/>Despite it was not action packed in the whole film, it was not boring. And the action scene were not created to impress the audience with explosion and muscle but to fulfill the task in storytelling. I could say every action scene was required to unfold the plot. (not a good sign for those who liked to see Hugh Jackman huge chest fans) <br/><br/>The plot unfolded chronologically for most of the time and the audience should have no problem in understanding the film. clean and obvious one plot storytelling was a great tension builder.

"richterbelmont10","7","1","6","31 May 2014"," Days of future past: It didn't make sense then, and it still doesn't!
","My summary of the movie:<br/><br/>So the X-Men are being hunted down and destroyed by Sentinels – powerful killing machines that can mimic and counter any mutant power. I guess that forces the eternal enemies Professor X and Magneto to work together. Wolverine shows up on the scene as well, all dressed up for the occasion. By the way, they never explained how Professor X was able to re-combobulate himself after being literally blown to smithereens in X3 by a raging Phoenix. By the end of THAT movie he was in another person's body. I felt part was glossed over somehow. What was also glossed over was the fact that Kitty Pride suddenly has the ability to send people back in time (well, in their mind anyway, but the result is pretty much the same.) So she sends Wolverine back in time so that he can stop the pivotal point when the Sentinel program gains the ability to defeat all mutants – that is, when Mystique is captured and her DNA harvested. So Wolverine reluctantly obliges. He is, after all, the best man for the job. Getting people to work together is his thing, since he's such a team player himself.<br/><br/>So back in 1970's, Wolverine and his bone claws go looking for Professor X, who's doped up on drugs with Beast as his supplier. They decide to break Magneto out of his no-metal prison. (How many times does Magneto end up in those?) To do this, they recruit The Flash to bust into the Pentagon, break out Magneto, so he can get to Mystique, who is out choking men to death with her feet. That's the plan anyway. (Although there doesn't seem to be much of a plan throughout the movie; everyone is just sort of improvising.) On the way, Magneto and the Prof. get into an argument, which almost ends up crushing the plane they're flying in. Thankfully, Mag gets a grip and fixes the plane. Then some really weird stuff happens. Mystique tries to kill a short guy, Mag tries to kill Mystique, Wolverine sees Stryker and gets a panic attack, which sends us back to the future and some more fight scenes between the Sentinels and a big black guy with a big gun, Storm who charges him up with her lightning, and a woman who is from the Portal games.<br/><br/>Back in the 70's, Magneto hops on a train with the Sentinels (1970's version) and injects them with metal from the rails so that he could control them. He then continues on his bewildering quest and (literally) picks up an entire baseball stadium and transports it to the White House. He then drags Nixon and his cronies up and out of their bomb shelter to convince them that he's not a threat (or is a threat, I forget). By the end, Mystique is convinced by X not to kill Shorty, which saves the future. Shorty ends up in jail for selling secrets to the US. That's what you get for messing with Nixon. Oh, and Wolverine gets horribly impaled and drowned. But he'll be OK.<br/><br/>So finally, back in the future, we see the end of all mutant-kind as the Sentinels pull Colossus apart (again), defeat Flame guy and Iceman, and Magneto gets impaled by a shard of metal of all things. Oh, the irony! And as we watch the destruction, we realize that it never took place at all. Wolverine wakes up at Xavier's school where he has a decent haircut and teaches history. He sees Jean Gray, the love of his life, still alive, which means X3 didn't happen. He goes to touch her, and Cyclops intercedes. Damn. Oh well, he quickly moves on and the movie ends with him and the Prof catching up, since apparently none of the X-Men movies ever really happened.<br/><br/>Series rebooted. Congratulations, Bryan Singer. You've destroyed everything you've created. <br/><br/>PS: If you stay until after the credits, you'll see a guy building pyramids out of Lego. Many people are worshipping him because, well, it's Lego!"

","I say children when I actually mean those newly orphaned films I had come to know as X-Men, X2, and... that other one.<br/><br/>Back in my Uni days there was an unwritten rule that disregarding the past was a pathway to destroying the future. If we changed history as it had already been recorded then there was no way that any good was ever going to come from it. I can't change the following... I thought 'Tank Girl' was better than 'Barb Wire', and that's not saying much as I walked out of both films in the cinema.<br/><br/>I actually walked out of both, I hate to say that but it's true, I can't change it now. I was my own worst hypocrite, I use to tell my friends that 'I hated people that walked out of cinemas before the film had finished.' To be fair though, with 'Barb Wire', I was getting freaky with a new flame and a bag of sweet chili nuts in the back row away from the soft lights.<br/><br/>That was a good moment, not my first 'liaison' in a cinema though, I had fun with Lisa from drama school on the opening day of 'Scream', never forget that, we broke our own rules that day. If there were security cameras in cinemas, I can only imagine the kind of things that would be recorded.<br/><br/>So there's a lot I would change and some I definitely wouldn't, maybe the 'Barb Wire' exodus had something to do with a premature ejaculation if I remember correctly. But that's not the point, the point is I can't change it now, it is set.<br/><br/>I know that time travel and all the paradoxes that go with it can set up some very interesting scenarios and indeed serve the SF and fantasy genres well. What I hate about DOFP is simple, for me - and this is only my own opinion having enjoyed most of the previous X films - I hate the fact that DOFP suddenly disregards pretty much everything that had gone before.<br/><br/>If I follow the films to fit into some form of time line then that's where it all breaks down for me and I err back to the unwritten Uni rule. I do understand all this nonsense about parallel time-lines and 'new world' spin offs but I just don't like it.<br/><br/>A lot of things didn't add up. The big no-no for me, aside from the other 678 no-no's is that if Phoenix ripped apart Xavier in X3, molecule by molecule, then how in the name of Tank Girl and Barb Wire is he alive and rolling in the supposed future of the original time line?<br/><br/>I like to be challenged and I like to be intellectually tested but DOFP is not the kind of test I want to experience again. Sure, Quicksilver's scene was good - but it wasn't that good, let's be honest. Magneto lifting a stadium was nice, for a few seconds, then it became as boring as the rest of the film. Jennifer Lawrence should simply retire after the 'Starving Games' is finished, or before, she is simply terrible. And Bryan Singer is so far removed from Keyser Soze that I feel like I'm living in a different time line!!<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy it and nor did the friends I watched it with, I didn't really understand it and this is the kind of film that I normally thrive on. It wasn't fun or exciting, it had no emotion or life to it. At the end of the day, I'm going back to the DVD store tomorrow, not to take it back, but DOFP has convinced me that maybe, just maybe, 'Tank Girl' and 'Barb Wire' might just be worth a re-watch after all."

","I watched this movie, expecting to see one of the best X-Men movies and I was half right. This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen but the reason I get it a 5 is because it does not feel like an X-Men movie at all.<br/><br/>X-Men and comic books in general are about exaggerated costumes and super powers it is NOT about melancholic drama, for which this movie is one of the best.<br/><br/>However I read X-Men, or watch the movies, to see those exaggerated costumes and super powers in the persona's we were reading about when we were kids. And for that, this movie has not enough. They could basically take all that out of this movie and it would be just as good.<br/><br/>So watch this movie but don't expect a super hero comic book movie. It is not."

","Is too bad that producers of all x-men movies have always included profanity and nudity not suitable for younger viewers in the family. All other movies with marvel characters (by other producers) are more family friendly. It's been proved that Hollywood does better with movies by marvel when movies are made suitable for all ages. I thought that after the first or second x-men movie, the producers would get it....but sadly they just don't. I have hesitated to rent the x-men movies because it is way too uncomfortable to have little ones watch something unsuitable for them.

","The first film was good, the second was fantastic, the third was disappointing, as was prequel Origins: Wolverine, prequel First Class was brilliant, and The Wolverine was a good warm up for this next instalment in the Marvel X-Men franchise, from director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns, Valkyrie). Basically in a dystopian future, mutants and humans are being exterminated by robots known as Sentinels, who have powers and strength gained from mutant genes, Kitty Pryde (Inception's Ellen Page) and a small band of mutants, including Bobby Drake aka Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), have evaded the robots and are taking cover in a China monastery. Her group meet with Professor X (Sir Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen), Logan aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Ororo Munroe aka Storm (Halle Berry) and discuss the past, in 1973 Raven aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) murdered Dr. Bolivar Trask (Game of Throne's Peter Dinklage), designer of the Sentinels, who used Mystique's genes to engineer the indestructible robots. The only way to stop the mutant and human destruction is to send someone back to 1973 and stop Mystique from killing Trask, Logan is the only one strong enough to stand the strain of his consciousness being transported to the past, he is told by Professor Xavier that he should find the younger versions of himself and Magneto for assistance. Logan wakes up in 1973, goes to the X-Mansion, there he meets younger Hank McCoy aka Beast (Skins' Nicholas Hoult), and Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), a broken man able to walk with a serum created by McCoy, but using it suppresses his telepathic powers, most teachers and students of the Institute for Gifted Youngsters are fighting the Vietnam War, the school is closed. Logan explains his mission, but Magento aka Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) is in a strong prison cell beneath the Pentagon, accused of killing President John F. Kennedy, eventually Logan persuades Xavier to free him, they get help from super fast mutant Peter Maximoff aka Quicksilver (Evan Peters). Meanwhile Trask is in Washington D.C. unsuccessfully campaigning his the Sentinel program to Congress, in Saigon meanwhile Mystique investigates him, discovering his capturing and experimenting on mutants, Xavier, Magneto, Beast and Wolverine track her down to Paris, where Americans and Vietnamese are negotiating to end the Vietnam War. Mystique is disguised as a general, Trask is attempting to sell the Sentinel technology to the Communists, but Mystique is stopped by the four mutants before she can kill him, Magneto tries to kill her to end it all, she is only wounded and disappears, the fight is taken outside where onlookers and cameras see them, and during it Logan recognises a young Major Bill Stryker (Josh Helman), responsible in the future for his torture, this momentarily causes his body discomfort in his future body. President Richard Nixon (Mark Camacho) decides to approve Trask's Sentinel program, with worldwide panic massing at the knowledge of mutants, a blood sample from Mystique was found on the ground, this is key to the Sentinels powers, an unveiling for them will happen in Washington D.C., but the prototypes have been intercepted by Magneto, with their frames laces with steel. Xavier is convinced that the only way to locate Mystique is to stop taking his serum and use his telepathic powers, but he will at the same time lose his ability to walk, he regains his powers and struggles at first with all the voices in his head, but seeing the future in Wolverine's head, and speaking to his future self, he is inspired to save the world and make peace between the humans and mutants, and uses Cerebro to track down Mystique. The Sentinels are unveiled by Nixon on the White House lawn, but Magnto raises the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium and drops it as a barricade around the Presidential building, while the robots attack the crowd the President and Trask are taken down to a safe room, with a disguised Mystique. Xavier, Wolverine and Beast try to stop Magneto, Wolverine is impaled by rebars and launched into the Potomac River, the safe room is pulled out of the ground by Magneto, he is about to kill what he thinks is Nixon, but it is in fact disguised Mystique who reveals herself and shoots him, at the same time as these events happening the Sentinels in the future have tracked the mutants down and are getting close, even killing most of the mutants. In 1973, Xavier explains what will happen if Mystique does kill Trask, and eventually she drops her gun, this in the future causes all events to disappear as the past has been changed, the Sentinel program is cancelled and Trask is arrested for selling military secrets, and Magneto is to be hunted down the dystopian future is averted, and Logan was rescued from the river by Mystique disguised as Stryker. In the end Logan wakes up in the present day at Xavier's school, and walking around he is happy to see recognisable mutant friends alive and well, including Iceman, Marie D'Ancanto aka Rogue (Anna Paquin), Peter Rasputin aka Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Kitty, Beast (Kelsey Grammar) and Storm, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Scott Summers aka Cyclops (James Marsden) and of course older Xavier. Also starring Bingbing Fan as Blink, Omar Sy as Bishop, Twilight's Booboo Stewart as Warpath, Adan Canto as Sunspot, Lucas Till as Havok, Evan Jonigkeit as Toad, Godzilla's Michael Lerner as Senator Brickman and Morgan Lily as Young Raven. fantasy action adventure. The cast all remain great in their recognisable roles, and the story combining future and past is clever and well constructed, but what really propelled this blockbuster was the outstanding special effects, for the fantastic mutant powers and destructive forces, and the fast moving fight and chase sequences, it really is one of the finest of the franchise, a brilliant fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!"

"ellimic","6","0","1","16 December 2018"," A bit of an awkward moment in the X-Men story
","The film was basically a feeble attempt to link the old Patrick Stewart generation of X-Men to the new James McAvoy breed, made apparent by the crossover scene where Stewart meets McAvoy.
I did like the new X-Men; Blink, Bishop and Warpath (although I couldn't really tell you what Warpaths power was except to see really far)
The new guy Sunspot was good but he seemed only a means of having an opposite for Iceman (in the previous films they had Pyro to do the same thing)<br/><br/>It made no real sense in the storyline of Stewart's timeline; at no point in the previous films had they even hinted at the threat of Trask's machines, yet it apparently stated long before his time?
Are we supposed to believe too that Wolverine was brought back from Japan to the USA by Stewart and McEllen (at the end of the preceding Wolverine film) and thrust into a sudden war? A war that engulfed the entire world yet Japan (for the events of his last film) was completely ignored?<br/><br/>And how did Stewart come back anyway, they never do reveal that big plot hole; last I saw Jean tore him apart at the atomic level, something only Wolverine himself could survive? He's a psychic not a healer.<br/><br/>The ending too seemed odd, Wolverine had changed time and as expected only HE remembered the timeline before which is fine, but suddenly Jean and Cyclops were alive as though they were saying 'discard the previous films' (which to be honest is no great loss)
And showing Wolverine in the past being dredged out of the river by Mystique impersonating Stryker suggested a sequel with him joining McAvoy's lot which we know won't happen because throughout the film he haddn't yet been used by the real Stryker to give him his adamantium claws."

The cinematography and the production design of the 1970s are realistic, and the performances of Jackman and McAvoy are impressive. However, the role Erik, or Magneto is just confusing, who does very little contribution to pushing forward the plot. It seems that the time given to the character is too much. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the future part is just cheap and lousy, particularly the visual effects, and is much like a third-tier Japanese movie.

"fernandoschiavi","8","0","1","4 October 2016"," The tone is 'grand finale', a plot that unites the films into a single, climactic conclusion
","The first two films of the X-Men franchise marked the beginning of a series of adjustments to the own mutant heroes, as many others. Both were directed by the talented Bryan Singer, who sat out the latest and most contested adaptations of mutants for film in X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men: First Class. Singer returns to the franchise now to continue the second trilogy of the characters and X-Men: Days of Future Forgotten serves as a sequel to the last two films of the series. For the script was hired Simon Kinberg, who had worked on the series as a producer and writer of X-Men: The Last Stand (2007).<br/><br/>One of the first points to address here is the question of chronology in the history of the X-Men. It is by far the most confusing film series with films that do not necessarily follow a logic in the events of the facts, which is further problematized with the solo adventures of Wolverine. In X-Men orgins: Wolverine, we know the origins of the character, but the Wolverine events: Immortal are ignored in this film, including in a flashback sequence of character when he asks the young Professor Charles Xavier into your mind. Aware of this chronological confusion and, taking advantage of existing stories in HQ exploiting this arc (which pleases the fans and also avoids criticism of the script solution), Simon Kinberg and producers have chosen to follow a more drastic way and that would solve many loose ends from previous productions: time travel and multiverse also as explored in comics. After all, the theme of the saga ""Days of Future Forgotten"" just brings the same idea of ​​producers, started in ""First Class"", which is to bring a darker tone, more apocalyptic the prequels.<br/><br/>It would not enough to explore the travel time theme if the script was not competent enough to ""reboot"" the franchise tying some arches of previous films and giving necessary elements and compelling for future productions. The implementation and convergence between the dark and devastating future and the past of the early 1970s the initial presentation was fundamental for the future decimated by Sentinels, which subsequently also affected the average human. We are introduced to new mutants Blink (Fan Bingbing), Sunspot (Adam Corner), Bishop (Omar Sy) and Apache (Booboo Stewart) with his powers and skills in panels worthy of Marvel pages, even if they have not had much time scene. After we can see the credulity of the situation and how devastating this future is being for all, we begin the journey to the past, specifically in 1973, where all the story develops, in fact.<br/><br/>Unlike the original trilogy and ""First Class"", the question of intolerance is not the main focus - still there because in a scenario of emergence of mutants, they are seen as an unknown by many, especially by Dr. Bolivar Trask - and rather, the consequence of our actions, they can influence and change the way we relate to others and how certain actions will interfere further. The protagonists - Wolverine, Xavier, Magneto and Mystique - must make their choices, and on the latter lies the greatest responsibility for the future.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer can very well deal with the two distinct eras portrayed. The scenes that take place in 1973 spend all the political and social climate, behavior, clothing, cars with all the characteristics of that time. To a junction with real events it is made (as the alleged involvement of Erik the assassination of President Kennedy). In the not so distant future, the environment is bleak and catastrophic. Simon Kinberg script can simultaneously insert mood at appropriate times and with some frequency. The greatest example is the Mercury mutant scene that perfectly allied fun and action in an impeccable use of slow motion with the visual effects. The character, played by Evan Peters, joined the plot to a specific function and then left abruptly, but not without leaving the scene in which it participates engraved in the minds of the audience. One of the best scenes not only the film, as the X-Men franchise.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer and his visual effects team did not disappoint. Allied to the point of photography Newton Thomas Sigel, some scenes are amazing, as simultaneous battles in which Magneto controls the Sentinels and when about the White House with the structure of a football stadium while that mutants of the future struggle against same Sentinels who discover their location. There is also the Magneto rescue scene prison culminating in the remarkable scene starring Mercury. The effects are used in the right measure and bring the action scenes an impressive grandeur. It should also be noted the soundtrack also long editor, John Ottman. The trail aligns perfectly with the mood of the production.<br/><br/>The tone is 'grand finale', a plot that unites the films into a single, climactic conclusion, joining two X-Men generations of very competent and cohesive manner. Although successful in most of the time, at times, the film relates well to the previous ones, but in others, virtually ignores the existence of material facts shown above. An excuse to virtually restart the franchise, and that was successful. Despite having a lot of scenes with effects, they are used for the sake of narrative, never placed exaggeratedly just to impress the technical aspect. Overall, the film achieves a degree of consistent balance and entering one of the best of the entire franchise. And there is a post-credits scene, which now introduces the next villain faced by the X-Men, Apocalypse, already showing the impact of all its power."
"Tweekums","8","0","1","31 July 2016"," Can the past be changed?
","In a not too distant future mutants, and those who may give birth to mutants are hunted down by Sentinels; robots that can sense mutant DNA and are resistant to mutant attacks thanks to a design that incorporates mutant DNA taken from Mystique in 1973. There is one way to prevent the war but it won't be easy. Kitty Pryde uses her powers to send Wolverine's consciousness back to his 1973 body in order to stop Mystique killing the Sentinel's designer Bolivar Trask the murder that led to the programme being authorised. It won't be easy; he will have to persuade both Charles Xavier and Magneto to help him; the former is taking medication that removes his power and the latter is imprisoned deep below the Pentagon! Even when he has them it won't be easy and the clock is ticking as time passes at the same rate in the future and the Sentinels are closing in on the Mutants.<br/><br/>This is a solid addition to the X-Men franchise; it starts with an exciting battle scene before setting up an enjoyable and interesting story. The story moves at a good pace and incorporates several impressive set-pieces; most notably the prison break to rescue Magneto and a scene at the Paris Peace Conference where the mutants are revealed to the world. All the action leads to an exciting show down in Washington DC. As one would expect the special effects are great and the cast does a fine job. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine naturally dominates the proceedings but the rest of the cast are impressive too; most notably Jennifer Lawrence who is great as Mystique. Peter Dinklage makes a good 'bad guy' as Trask; I liked the fact that he isn't played as an evil character. The ending does undo some of the things that happened in the opening trilogy leading to some enjoyable appearances from some familiar characters that hadn't been seen for a while. Overall an enjoyable film that fans of the franchise should enjoy."
"sam_smithreview","9","0","1","6 May 2016"," Awesome film, awesome story and great acting
","I was so intrigued about this movie. I had a terrible feeling of disappointment because First Class was absolutely fine and riveting. That one was even better than X-Men 2 (the last one directed by Brian Singer before this). So I tried to went to see this with low expectation. And what a wonderful entertainment and surprising thoughtful story I found here. I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters – but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot – and also the most interesting. Different time- lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last installment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves). <br/><br/>What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations – at least as far as I'm concerned – is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists – what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no- holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie)."

That being said, what it being the return of the old 'X-Men' cast, and I being also familiar with the 'Days Of Future Past' comic I was already expecting it to be another good movie in the franchise, but it turns out not only was 'Days Of Future Past' the best X-Men movie yet, it's possibly the best comic-book movie ever made."
"Christopher_Reid","8","0","1","10 February 2016"," My favourite X-Men movie, quite a lot of good action scenes
","I'm not really a fan of the X-Men movies overall. Including Bryan Singer's first two. He feels like a bit of a one-hit-wonder director. The Usual Suspects was brilliant but I believe that's mainly due to its script and great cast. Singer has a good visual style but he can go wayward if something is missing. All his other movies have been comparatively disappointing (Superman Returns was especially awful apart from Parker Posey who is hilarious).<br/><br/>The X-Men movies are consistently too serious for their own good. The basic premise is incredibly stupid, much moreso than other superhero franchises. Every character is ridiculous and there are so many confusing contradictions - the limits of the powers and the ""rules"" of the universe are never fully clear. That's all fine though. As long as the tone of the movies is fun and focuses on fantasy, adventure and action. But they always mention evolution which it has nothing to do with (and shows a deep misunderstanding of evolution). And they try to relate the plight of fictional mutants with civil rights. It doesn't work.<br/><br/>This movie fortunately spends more time on spectacle, action and character development. Some of it is stupid and questionable but overall its impressive how many ideas they were able to fit in. The story is far-fetched but fairly fresh and clever. It's a bit akin to Inception, going into a kind of dream (the past) in order to cause some deep, fundamental change that alters the path of history. Oh, but only Wolverine can go back, you know, because he heals the fastest. Don't ask too many questions okay?<br/><br/>It's nice to see so many characters and to have them played by the original actors. The action is fast-paced but I was able to pick up on a lot of nice details. The way the Sentinels imitate powers to their advantage, using fire against ice and vice-versa. It's funny that all Magneto has to do is twitch an eyebrow and raise a hand to make ball bearings fly or to lift a stadium off the ground. When he lowers it, it barely causes a slight rumble. Physics. He can also close his eyes and control extremely intricate patterns of metal twisting and connecting to stuff he can't see from hundreds of metres away.<br/><br/>Quicksilver is a cool new character who can move extremely fast. But he doesn't die from any of the numerous ways that this would kill a person. And he is pretty fast to disappear from the movie as well, which is a shame as he's unique and amusing. It's funny that his co-star from Kick Ass plays the same character in Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>Part of the movie is set in ""China"" as the writing tells us. I guess that's all we need to know, right? I'm surprised they didn't just say ""Asia"". Another part is set in ""Paris"". For no apparent reason other than to let us watch Jennifer Lawrence practise her French (and Vietnamese).<br/><br/>There's a funny impersonation of Nixon that doesn't have much to do with the rest of the movie. We see the tape recorder under his desk. We also find something out about the bullet(s) that hit Kennedy. There are some funky 70s costumes and hairstyles going on. But it's irrelevant to the plot and a bit distracting. The acting isn't bad but it feels a bit over-the-top, especially with the young Professor X. At least most of it seems sincere.<br/><br/>I'm hesitantly excited for X-Men: Apocalypse. If they can focus on epic action scenes and not worry too much about trying to be sad or meaningful, it could be really good."
"geertthegreenlantern","9","0","1","27 January 2016"," Great addition to the genre
","A good film and one that proves the superhero genre isn't stale yet...or maybe it's just the X-Men, who in comic book runs have had favorable arcs & interesting character development, along with Bryan Singer's expertise in juggling it all that makes these films attractive even to superhero haters. ""X-men: Days"" tells us a tale of a doomed future where our mutant friends face extinction. Their hope lies in Ellen Page's character Kitty that can transfer consciences back in time, that conscience would be the Wolverine (apparently he's the only one that can survive the journey to 1972), so the young Charles can stop Mystique from killing Peter Dinklage who's the ""MacGuffin"" or plot goal here.... If you think about it, it makes no sense & it sounds ridiculous...but somehow this turns out to be glorious in all it's time-hopping, special effects blazing wonder. Much credit to the actors who by now are comfortable in their roles, seeing both old & new cast was wonderful. James McAvoy carries the movie, along with wondrous Quicksilver scene. Even Jennifer Lawrence isn't annoying because she was nice side role. I am worried they'll give her too big a part in ""Apocalypse"" but that's Hollywood I guess.<br/><br/>Cinematography is excellent & CGI is one of the best I've seen. It's easy to get effects fatigue with all these mutants running around like what happened in ""X-Men: Last Stand"" but Singer makes it all look top notch. Music was good, I felt invested & hoped for a good outcome. I shed a tear seeing Famke Janssen at the end, it was a sly way to get Jean Grey back<br/><br/>A fun movie, you don't need to know your X-Men to enjoy a good blockbuster here, recommended for all movie lovers."

","Like the title of my summary states; in my eyes this one stands alone (timeline aside). The fact that both sides had to get together to defeat a new enemy always was my favorite part about x-men because tensions rise and your always left to wonder will there be a catch, does one side have a secret element which will put them at an advantage. Realizing it was done in the other films yet specifically in this one there's so much tension your thinking: if there is an alternate plan from one of the sides how can they withhold that in this situation. Plus they finally brought in some intense challengers other than the usual brotherhood vs x-men."

To help stop this issue before it starts, Wolverine must be sent back in time and prevent the sentinel program from getting off the ground.

","Y'know, I've gotta be honest, it's not all that hard for an X-Men movie to please me. Cast Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, don't call it ""X-Men United"", and already you're on your way. And with ""Days of Future Past"", aside from the killer story hook, I really just came here hoping for Sentinels. Yep, giant robots. I'm an easy mark.<br/><br/>But it's also loaded got just the right ingredients (Fassbender, McAvoy, a slo-mo shootout set to ""Time in a Bottle"" and Jackman continues to be a series highlight; he is unbelievable in this role. I was surprised at just how fringe Halle Berry has become, her role almost non-speaking. It's the right way to go. <br/><br/>This is a fine movie, both as a comic book spectacle and as an adaptation of a landmark Marvel storyline. It capably juggles a boatload of goings-on during two concurrent time periods, and the battle scenes are pretty well done, too. Basically, they didn't screw it up. And they could've. It's a stellar return to the series for Singer, and I'm looking forward to ""X-Men: Apocalypse"".<br/><br/>8/10"
"jephtha","8","0","1","27 September 2015"," The best and most consequential of the X-Men movies so far
","I wouldn't consider myself an avid fan of the X-Men. I know the basics of most of the characters and am familiar with some of the more significant stories, but as a whole they don't really command my respect, especially in regards to their film counterparts. In fact, out of the previous 6 movies, the only key players to leave a particularly good impression are Magneto and Nightcrawler. ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"", however, flies in the face of expectations on multiple levels, and may represent the apex of this rocky film series.<br/><br/>The ""X-Men"" movies have suffered from 3 common problems, one of which is remedied, one of which is kind of remedied, and one that is only worse. These problems are: an overabundance of characters, Wolverine's portrayal and the action.<br/><br/>Considering the wide array of superpowers, it's a wonder that none of these movies excel in terms of action. Most of the more impressive abilities are given a limited showcase, and most of the skirmishes are limited to mundane hand-to-hand combat. To date, the best of these remains the infiltration of the White House by Nightcrawler in ""X2"". ""Days of Future Past"" is a definite downgrade in this arena, which is what disappointed me greatly upon the first viewing. The only thrilling/amusing sequence in this respect is the extraction of Magneto with Quicksilver, and the glimpses into the future war seem to tease us with a far more interesting conflict. However, when focusing on the other aspects of the production, this failing becomes almost trivial.<br/><br/>Going off of the topic of action, Wolverine's portrayal is mostly improved. Sure, he's still a punching bag when fighting other superhumans, but, as with every other major player here, he works better as a realized individual than an action figure. In addition to the usual witticisms, Wolverine's role greatly demonstrates how much he has matured over the course of this film series, largely because it poses a challenge that can't simply be sliced. It centers on his admiration for Xavier and determination to fulfill his mission.<br/><br/>""Days of Future Past"" doesn't have a huge cast in competition for screen time. The focus is squarely on the 4 key players, with Beast along for the ride. Sure, there are other mutants present, but there is no pretending that their role is anything more than supplementary. It's an approach that allows for the relationships to feel more pertinent and natural. The evolution of the opposing ideologies of Xavier and Magneto is much more poignant than in ""First Class"", where it didn't feel convincing for wanting of time. They're clearly affected by the weight that comes from championing the two sides of a conflict, and, thankfully, it is shown that there indeed were hard feelings over their last encounter. In this respect, the juxtaposition between their interactions in the past and future is kind of striking.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence continues to grow in the role of Mystique, showing rudimentary aspects of the incarnation from the earlier films. Her time on screen is noticeably lesser than that of the other key players, but no scene is wasted; her prowess as an infiltrator and hardy demeanor are on full display. Peter Dinklage, on the other hand, is a waste as Bolivar Trask. He was clearly chosen for the role due to his current popularity, and the character fails to come across as anything more than pompous, as opposed to someone with credible reasons for what he is doing. William Stryker from ""X2"", despite his zealous approach, remains the most convincing mutant loathing human from the films. I'm actually curious if they'll ever dispose of the ""gray area"" approach and include someone who simply has an extreme prejudice of mutants, and is all the more lethal for it. The shadowy Director from the comics would be an ideal candidate for this.<br/><br/>Thanks to an early established objective for these guys, the storyline is more concentrated and better flowing than in the previous installments. Not to mention, it's not an objective that merely allows for a string of skirmishes; it requires crucial developments from those involved and lends a palpable sense of weight, both of which weren't strong suits for the other ""X-Men"" movies. Very little feels out of place or unnecessary, and everything builds to a climax that fails on the visceral level, but is ultimately more fulfilling than that. For the first time in a decade, I can say that I'm interested in the next direction this series will take."
"justingivens-37319","8","0","1","27 September 2015"," Great Movie
","This movie is by far one of the best X-men movies. The plot twist is very intriguing where it has Wolverine (Huge Jackson) going back into the past in order to alter the future. Also in the movie, the X-men face an enemy like never before which forces Professor X and Magneto to work together. <br/><br/>This is the type of movie where you have to watch from start to end because the director, Bryan Singer, is always throwing little hints and flashbacks that connect all of the previous X-men movies with this one. You won't need to watch all the previous movies in order to understand this one; however I would suggest watching the previous movie X-Men:First Class (2011) because that movie is most directly tied to this one.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great movie that is very enjoyable no matter if you read the comic books or not."

","I've never seen an X-Men movie before until X-men First Class came out which was a well done movie that showed the origins of the story on how Charles Xavier met Erik Lensherr. But X-Men Days of Future Past was a sequel to that story and it was one hell of a good one! First of all the characters in this movie are all great, and in this movie we saw some new sides of characters we loved such as Mystique and Wolverine. There was although one character that i wanted to see more of (I won't name it just in case you haven't seen the movie yet) but that didn't effect the movie. The action scenes were awesome and there was also some moments of heart and hope throughout the movie with a touch of comedy every now and then. As a whole the movie was never boring, it kept me locked and excited to see what will happen next and how will the story continue. It was a very entertaining movie that every Marvel fan will definitely enjoy and i can't wait to see X-Men Apocalypse to find out what will happen next."
"shannonjefferies","6","0","1","21 August 2015"," So many plot holes you have to try not to think - at all
","I liked the overall storyline, but this movie is nothing but one plot hole after another. To start with, Kitty has to constantly stand over Wolverine while she's projecting him back in time. But since he spends several days in the past, doesn't that mean she also has to stand there for several days? Wouldn't she at least have to have a bathroom break once and a while? Next, I'd like to know where Quicksilver got his Walkman from. Did he travel to the future, because this movie takes place in 1973 but Walkman's weren't invented until 1979? Now, as for Magneto, his power is to manipulate metal, right? So when he's standing on top of the train how does he know where to place the metal inside of it? Does he also have x-ray vision? And why do the robots obey his commands? Did he also reprogram them? Maybe he took computer programing classes while he was in prison - although that seems pretty unlikely considering most people didn't own a digital watch or even a pocket calculator back then. Finally, when Magneto orders the robots to kill the mutants, why don't they just immediately shoot him first? I mean he's standing right next to them, so shouldn't he be the first mutant they spot? Sorry but this movie has so many plot holes, the only way to enjoy it is to abandon all logic and just try not to think - at all."
"bryank-04844","8","0","1","17 August 2015"," This is the BEST 'X-Men' movie to date and is well worth one-hundred viewings.
","The big blockbuster movies for the summer of 2014 have officially kicked off and 'X- Men: Days of Future Past' might be the best one yet. For the past year, I've been looking forward to seeing this and original X-Men director Bryan Singer returning to this storyline. If you remember, back in 2000, Singer was the first director to take on a big budget comic book movie with the first 'X-Men' film, and the studios were waiting to see if it was going to do enough business. Made on what seems to be a modest budget of only $75 million, the first X-Men film made $300 million domestically, and that's before 3D and all of the IMAX screens. Well, the rest is history, as we have had tons of comic book films come out since then. But it feels great to be back with the one that started it all.<br/><br/>First off, this 'X-Men' film is superbly shot and told. It deals with time travel, and not every director and writer in the business can tell a good time travel story without some people getting thrown off course. But here, it is done exceptionally well and is easy to follow. If the title 'Days of Future Past' confuses you, don't worry, I'll explain it. The title refers to a story arc of the X-Men comic books and focused on a desolate Earth where these large and highly adaptable robots called Sentinels destroyed everyone and everything. You might remember the Sentinels as the giant purple robot bad guys from the comics. It's as if the worst possible outcome of a 'Terminator' were to come true, only with no Arnold Schwarzenegger to handle things and save the day.<br/><br/>These Sentinels are zeroing in on the X-Men, as it seems they are the last of the mutants left on Earth. In an amazing opening scene, we see Magneto (Ian McKellen), Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Bishop (Omar Sy), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Blink (Bingbing Fan), Sunspot, Warpath, and Colossus, Halle Berry returning as Storm and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine trying to fight off these Sentinels. Singer must be a huge 'Portal' fan, because there is a lot of portal opening going on here in the style of the game. And it's so much fun to watch. Pryde is able to take somebody's mind and soul and send it back in time, which Xavier and Magneto want to do to stop this Sentinel war from starting. But the ability to go back in time to the early 70s would rip apart anyone's brain.<br/><br/>But since Wolverine can regenerate immediately, he is sent back in time to find the young Prof. Xavier (Jame McAvoy) and the young prisoner Magneto (Michael Fassbender) to help stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing Dr, Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), who is responsible for creating the sentinels and selling them to anyone who wants to buy them. We find out that Mystique killing Trask is the one event that sets in motion the destruction of the future that we see in the first scene.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film is running around with Wolverine and the younger versions of Magneto, Xavier, and Beast (Nicholas Hoult) as they try and fix the past so that the world is not destroyed and they can keep their lives. It literally is a race against time. One of the coolest scenes involved Quicksilver (perfectly played by Evan Peters), when he broke Magneto out of prison. I could watch that scene on loop for hours. If you can believe it, Wolverine plays the level-headed man through the entire film this time around and focuses more on the young Xavier coming to terms with his handicap and dealing with his super power and McAvoy shows his struggle flawlessly.<br/><br/>Fassbender is cool as ice as Magneto again and Peter Dinklage is as good as ever as the evil Dr. Trask. One of the only complaints is the lack of a big epic climactic fight scene at the end. Sure, there is a big climax, but it offers very little fighting. But that's nit-picking. And of course, stay till the end of the credits for a great scene of what's to come. The acting, filming, and special effects were all top notch here and I want Quick Silver spin off movie for sure. This is the BEST 'X-Men' movie to date and is well worth one-hundred viewings."
"cinemageek-78489","8","0","1","9 August 2015"," Slow but steady
","Many fans think that Days of Future Past is the best in the franchise, but I have a different opinion. Yes, it was still a great film, but it was pretty slow compared to the films prior to Future Past. A bit too much drama in a superhero film to me, but when it did have action it was great. Like everyone else, my favorite part was when after Wolverine, Beast, Professor X, and Quicksilver break out Magneto from the Pentagon the latter went into, like, hyper-mode and was just rearranging all the soldiers and their weapons so that they couldn't get caught and imprisoned. The beginning was pretty thrilling and suspenseful as well, when Kitty Pryde barely got Bishop back in time to warn the team that the Sentinels (anti-mutant robots developed by Bolivar Trask in the 70's) knew where their location was. For those who have become really attached to the characters and get emotional easily, the scene where the Sentinels wipe out the X-Men from the future can be upsetting. First, Storm gets impaled by a Sentinel climbing up a cliff and tossed over the edge, and then everything falls apart from there. The Sentinels then shoot energy beams at Bishop, who, like the Extremis soldiers in Iron Man 3, absorbs too much energy and eventually explodes. Blink tries her best to hinder the Sentinels, but three of them stab her simultaneously (one in the back, two in the side). Colossus gets ripped in half (from his torso) and Sunspot is impaled. Warpath has his face burnt off. Magneto survives, but is mortally impaled by a piece of metal shrapnel. Overall, the film's tone is pretty dark but there are some funny parts. Great movie, just a bit slow."

","X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014): Dir: Bryan Singer / Cast: Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Peter Dinkledge: Another visually stunning fantastic superhero epic. This one regards choices and corrections. Wolverine is sent back in time to prevent a series of events from happening that could extinct mutants. Due to his ability to heal he is the only mutant who can withstand the time travel but time is running out. Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy play the older and younger versions of Charles Xavier, a mutant with the most power over the mind. While Stewart is confident from years of fighting the mutant war, McAvoy is depressed and desires freedom from his ability until Wolverine intervenes. Ian McKellen and Michael Fassbender play the older and younger Magneto who can manipulate metal. McKellen's villain has come to terms with Xavier and forms an alliance. Fassbender is broken out of confinement yet still has evil tendencies. Jennifer Lawrence plays Mystique who can manipulate herself into the image of any person. She is set to assassinate a scientist who uses her DNA as part of the answer to destroy mutants. Xavier uses his mind power to attempt to reason with her but she is determined to bring justice through murder. Peter Dinkledge is terrific as the villain scientist whom Mystique seeks revenge upon. Extremely entertaining with Bryan Singer returning as director to set the tone. The action is exhilarating and the special effects are flashy and guarantee the best of past and future in terms of visual presentation of storytelling. Score: 9 / 10"

","""X-Men"" director Bryan Singer finally returned to the fold to helm Twentieth Century Fox's fourth entry ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" with the youngsters from ""X-Men: First Class"" prequel intermingling with original cast members. Indeed, this X-Men sequel relies on the plot gimmick that distinguished the first two ""Terminator"" movies when the rebels dispatched somebody from the future to plunge back into the past to thwart Skynet's efforts to triumph over humanity. Naturally, it is fantastic to see Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, and Halle Berry sharing the screen with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbinder respectively as Professor X and Magneto. When the action opens, Earth is a ravaged battlefield where Sentinels destroy every mutant that they can target. Lately, they have been targeting normal humans who may give birth to mutated humans. Singer and ""Elysium"" scenarist Simon Kinberg drew inspiration from the 1981 Uncanny X-Men storyline ""Days of Future Past"" written by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. This ""X-Men"" movie qualifies as one of the best, if not the best, in the Marvel Comics' franchise."

If you don't read the comics, a little foundation laying is nice and helpful. <br/><br/>As for the past, the cast is the same as in X-MEN: First Class. I like McAvoy and Fassbender as the younger Charles and Erik, respectively. Hoult as Beast actually steals every scene he is in for me. He is fantastic at playing at your emotions. As in First Class, I still didn't like Lawrence as Raven/Mystique. It just doesn't work. I needed Rebecca Romijn back, or someone that reminded me more of her.

","When Professor X, Magneto (played by their original trilogy actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen respectively) and the mention of Trask Industries showed up in the post-credits scene of 2013's The Wolverine, hard core fans knew what was in the pipeline for the X-Men franchise. The introduction of the younger version characters was no longer just for a reboot, something much bigger was in store. The end result is X- Men: Days of Future Past, (DoFP) a timeline hopping, crossover cast, superhero epic that rightfully takes the crown has the best X-Men film to date.<br/><br/>One thing that is first noticed in DoFP is that this isn't going to be your average superhero film. The crossing over of the younger and older casts of the franchise seems to be the set up for enormous battles and epic action, but in reality, DoFP is more interested in telling a unique and enticing story rather than blow away fans with loads of action a la The Avengers. <br/><br/>Based off one of Marvel Comics all-time greatest stories, Days of Future Past's story is a time traveling epic. The older cast of characters must send Wolverine back in time to prevent a global disaster from occurring in the present day. The film stays close to its comic book source and this only strengthens the movie. While many time traveling films can easily get you confused in its story, DoFP is able to smoothly transition between the two timelines, never leaving the film feeling confusing or boring. DoFP is at its best when you allow yourself to get lost in its deep, exciting and powerful story. The heavy focus on telling a emotional and smart story is a wonderfully welcomed addition to the superhero genre and a focus I hope stays within the X-Men film franchise. It's not Professor X versus Magento. It's all mutant kind standing as one, and that is a sight to behold. With fantastic writing from X-Men: First Class director Matthew Vaughn, Simon Kindberg along with the splendid directing of Bryan Singer, Days of Future Past sets itself apart from its superhero competitors for the better.<br/><br/>Now while the focus is on rich storytelling, that doesn't mean there aren't exciting action sequences. Powered by an enormous cast of diverse and super cool characters, wonderful CGI and terrifically written action scenes, Days of Future Past's action pulls you in, despite the overall lack of action sequences. At one point I was disappointed by the absence of straight up shredding by Wolverine, and sometimes you feel has if there's not enough crazy battles going on. But I had to take a step back and remind myself that this film wasn't about that. No, this movie is about something bigger than hacking and slashing. The action is emotional as it is intense, further cementing the sense of depth in this movie. The pacing of the film is fantastic, and this benefits the entire film, action especially. It may seem like Days of Future Past is out for Avengers style team battles, and while there definitely are some great action scenes, for this film, it goes deeper than that. <br/><br/>The ensemble cast of both the original trilogy and the younger character cast combine together to create a truly grand set of some of the best the X-Men universe has to offer, with some of the today's best actors playing them. Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy are both back to play older and younger versions of Professer X, while the same can be said for Ian McKellen and Michael Fassbender playing Magento. Hugh Jackman once again returns for a role which has been permanently his for 14 years and counting and continues to make fans wish he never aged in real life. Super star Jennifer Lawrence also returns as Mystique and furthers her stardom in Hollywood with another wonderful performance. The list goes on and on; Nicholas Hoult as The Beast, Peter Dinklage as antagonist Bolivar Trask, excellent newcomer Evan Peters as Quicksilver with returns from X-Men series vets such as: Halle Berry as Storm, Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, Shawn Ashmore as Iceman and even Daniel Cudmore as Colossus. The list goes even further but I won't spend the space in this review just listing names, but telling you how great each and every performance is.<br/><br/>The younger cast takes about 75 percent of the screen time (excluding Wolverine) and understandably so. However, it is somewhat disappointing that the original cast couldn't be squeezed in a bit more. The story does focus mainly on the past, but watching the 2014 version of the likes of Storm, Iceman and Colossus is just simply far superior than their 2000's counterparts, largely due to how far technology has come in just 8 years with special effects. All in all, the entire cast gives a phenomenal performance and gives us the most grand cast of characters ever seen in a single superhero film.<br/><br/>X-Men: Days of Future Past sets out to evolve the superhero genre and it certainly succeeds. The primary focus on delivering a memorable, powerful and exciting story is at the heart of the film. Supplement that with beautifully rendered CGI (I'm looking at you Quicksilver) engaging if somewhat minimal action, and a crossover cast of some on the most universally praised actors toady, who all give spectacular performances. DoFP is just the beginning of a much larger future for the X-Men series with X-Men: Apocalypse on the way in 2016. But make no mistake, as of right now Days of Future Past sits atop the X-Men franchise and once again makes the X-Men name a contender in the ultra competitive world of superhero films.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Starring- Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and Peter Dinklage<br/><br/>X-Men: Days of Future Past 8/10- I have been a fan of the X-Men films all of my life and when I saw the trailer for this new X-Men movie, all I could say was ""Please let this one be good!"" And my hopes were more than answered. With a cast as talented as this one and director Bryan Singer fixing all of the mistakes made in X-Men: The Last Stand, everything worked out better than I could have imagined. Days of Future Past combines all of our favorite characters from the previous X-Men films with exciting new concepts and effects to engineer ones of the best blockbusters of the year and the most exciting X-Men movie yet. <br/><br/>There is so much I could say about this sequel/prequel that makes it more unique and overall, better than its predecessors. The major thing though was the enjoyment of seeing all of the characters from the X-Men combined into one film. Anyone could have guessed that if X-Men could somehow do this than it would be a hit on this standard alone. The key thing though was pulling it off without ruining the entire film. I do not want to give away any specifics but Bryan Singer basically made his own version of time-travel to do exactly what was needed, and I have not seen this good of a time-travel movie since Back to the Future. <br/><br/>The acting is my and pretty much everyone's favorite part. This new picture features nearly everyone in it at the top of their acting game. I have seen all of the returning characters in other X-Men films and they all did tremendously well. The performances that I really enjoyed were James McAvoy, who plays young Professor Charles Xavier, and Jennifer Lawrence(big surprise),who plays Raven aka Mystique. I will be honest, I was a little disappointed by James McAvoy in X-Men:First Class because I knew he could have gone to another level of acting if he just figured out how to get there. He found out how in this brand new one. Jennifer Lawrence did not have as much experience acting in big blockbusters at the time of X-Men: First Class and now that she has, she was really able to display her confidence and comfortability in her character. <br/><br/>The special effects were all executing amazingly which is what I would expect from Bryan Singer by now. There is only one scene where I was really left in awe at how well it was done and everyone in the theater agreed with me and was even laughing at how funny it was at the same time. I do not want to ruin the surprise but make sure you are watching in all the scenes that Pietro/Peter Maximoff aka Quicksilver is in. The design of the sentinel robots was something I especially enjoyed and also seemed rather familiar to me. Even if the sentinel robots looked like they were copied from Thor, I do not think they could have been done better. <br/><br/>The plot pretty much speaks for itself in this film. The concepts and theories that were introduced though were nearly mind-blowing to the audience and leaving you thinking when you walk out the theater. Again, time-travel is very tricky to deal with in films because you have to be so careful using it. Even the slightest mistake could end up ruining the whole story, luckily that did not occur and the story was rewarded because of it. <br/><br/>Was X-men Days of Future Past the best X-Men? Yes, even better than X2. I very much recommend you see this movie in theaters and if you do, make sure to stick around after the credits. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

","Finally an X-men movie that brings back the same feelings of awe and intrigue I only remember feeling reading the comics while growing up. If you are an old school fan then finally you have an X-men movie that delivers the nostalgia you have expected but (in my opinion)has not been delivered in the previous films. As a 40 year old adult I have waited for an X-men movie that would bring me back to the past when the X-men comics fascinated me and caused me to ponder the great things of politics,freedom,and equal rights. When I read my first X-men comic as kid growing up in the 80's, I thought ""this is awesome"" and that's my same conclusion regarding X-men :Days of Future Fast...awesome!"

","Brian Singer has truly outdone himself with this one. Not only is the action dazzling, the soundtrack exciting and emotional (the old X2 theme returns!), the special effects top notch, the cinematography great, the direction amazing, and the acting phenomenal, but the story and the character development is what really sets this movie apart. You genuinely care about these people and what happens. As far as comic book movies go, it doesn't get any better than this. Not since the Dark Knight Trilogy has there been such an emphasis on story and character rather than the VFX and action. My already high expectations were easily surpassed. Fans of both First Class and the originals will love this one. It's the perfect reboot/sequel and as an X-Men fan I couldn't be happier!"

","In 2014 there are many marvel movies released but this was best. Bryan Singer returns and made best X-Men movie after being absent for the past four films, and what a return he has made. 'Days of Future Past' is truly an impressive and spectacular installment in both the 'X- Men' franchise and the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, combining the casts from both the original trilogy and the prequel allowing the audience to view the 'X- Men' in the past, present and future. The action scenes are intense and spectacularly choreographed with some fantastic heroes and foes fighting both against and alongside each other. As a personal opinion, 'Days of Future Past' is the best film to have graced the Marvel film franchise and one of the greatest superhero films of all-time. A visually stunning and exhilarating flick that combines the best elements of the series to create a fantastic and entertaining film. The story was amazing but i was disappointed by 3d effects."
"TxMike","Null","0","3","3 November 2014"," The XMen go ""back to the future"".
","For one who likes an exciting and entertaining movie this one does exactly that.<br/><br/>It starts in the future, but only about 50 years past 1973. So that would make it about 2023. The XMen mutants are desperately fighting androids and are losing badly. The only solution it seems is to return to 1973 and change the sequence of events that led to the development of the androids.<br/><br/>Since they can't really time-travel, the body of Wolverine actually stays in the future but his mind is projected back to 1973, where his body looks pretty much the same. Once there he has to look up the much younger Xavier and Erik, and then convince them that he is indeed from the future and to gain their assistance in changing events. It isn't easy, otherwise it would be a very short movie.<br/><br/>This is the version where Jennifer Lawrence is cast as Mystique and she is very good in the role. <br/><br/>The movie also has a very nice, aggressive soundtrack with deep, picture-rattling bass."
"cherold","9","0","2","2 November 2014"," Terrifically entertaining
","Tieing with X-Men First Class for best movie of the series, DOFP is a blast from the insanely exciting opening battle. The action scenes are all well done, and there is a scene with Quicksilver taking on a roomful of armed men that is absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>I often feel modern action films are a little too desperate to keep BIG THINGS happening all the time (it was my objection The Avengers), but DOFP is nicely paced, focusing more on character than special effects, even though the special effects are terrific. It's a relatively thoughtful take on the comic book movie.<br/><br/>There is one plot point that I felt was weak. Basically, a decision is made in the beginning that results in trouble later on, and it's something anyone with half a brain would have foreseen. And the case for that decision seemed severely under-developed. It's a flaw I can live with, but I wish it weren't there."
"dipdapblue8-110-681565","9","0","1","25 October 2014"," X-Men: Days of Future Past succeeds at being a thrilling and fun superhero movie, balanced by well-earned dramatic weight.
","X-Men: Days of Future Past combines the best elements of the series to produce a satisfyingly fast-paced outing that ranks among the franchise's finest installments. X-Men: Days of Future Past is by far the most ambitious film in the franchise an attempt to take the entire six-film saga and all of the notorious continuity errors that come with it and soft-reboot it via a story that is both character drama and spectacle, meant to honor both the Original Trilogy and First Class halves of the franchise. Against all odds, Singer manages to deliver all of the above, resulting in the best X-Men movie to date, and a comic book movie that could arguably be placed in the company of the genre's elite. It is with a sad note of irony that, on a directorial level, Bryan Singer has delivered his best film ever. Days of Future Past is a showcase of directorial talent, to the point that it is arguably a handful of well-crafted movies, woven together. The futuristic sci-fi world and mutant action sequences are awesome spectacle, while the future Sentinels are dark, frightening creatures; the '70s period piece is colorful, gleefully retro, and well-staged in nearly every scene; and there's an excellent character drama at the film's core, utilizing great actors who deliver performances above and beyond expectations of the genre."
"Floated2","10","0","1","22 October 2014"," Lives Up to Expectations
","X-Men: Days of Future Past was a highly anticipated film and sequel to X-Men: First Class in 2011. This film begins sometime in the near future, we see a scorched landscape controlled, it seems, by autonomous machines. Mutants are the enemy and the machines have evolved to the point where no one is safe. A battle is still raging with several familiar mutant heroes fighting, mostly in vain, to gain a foothold against the frightful Sentinels. But all is not lost, Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) hatch a plan to send the consciousness of one of the team back into the past. In doing so, the hope is that, armed with knowledge of a possible grim future, the wrongs can be righted and new present can be created.<br/><br/>The main highlight of the film is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), whose unique healing powers prove to be very useful when it comes to tripping the time travel continuum. Falling back into the 1970s, Wolverine must convince a jaded and alcoholic, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) to join forces with Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and change the future.<br/><br/>While not nearly as much fun as the last adventure that effectively rebooted the franchise, ""Days of Future Past"" has more narrative weight. The metaphor for racism that the mutant struggle represents is not lost as the United States recovers from the regretful setbacks in Vietnam and is forced confront a new Cold War menace. Enter Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), who has developed a machine that can detect the presence of a mutant. Once identified, Trask's solution to the mutant problem is to kill them. This terribly heavy-handed approach is a one of the film's narrative failings, especially considering that it does away with all judicial process that is one of the bedrock fundamental rights all American's share. Trask hints that mutants aren't even human, rather, they are a completely different species. One can logically imagine that that means no trials and the death penalty is okay. ==================================================================== ====== As a rewatch 07/07/17' X-Men: Days of Future Past remains perhaps the best X-Men film to date. Having all the great elements which made it great as it combines everything into one. This film works great because they focus on one main plot (unlike Apocalypse) and there aren't a loaded amount of characters. It is much more intense, thrilling and overall entertaining in comparison to Apocalypse after rewatching that as well. Also, the characters of Magneto, Mystique and Beast appear to be more engaged and aggressive where as in Apocalypse they seemed slightly bored. Rating changed from 9 to 10/10"
"brchthethird","8","0","1","19 October 2014"," An excellent comic book film that gets the X-Men back on track
","This latest installment in the X-Men franchise is epic in scope and course-corrects previous mistakes (X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine), but also has a core story which is compelling, and a host of characters both new and old that elevate this to being quite possibly the best X-Men film since X2. The basics of the story is that in the post-apocalyptic future, Sentinels are evolved and have mutants on the run. In order to prevent this from happening, Wolverine's consciousness is sent back to 1973 to bring Charles and Erik together to stop Mystique from killing Bolivar Trask, the creator of the Sentinels. What ensues is a truly epic movie that should please X-Men fans. There's not much I didn't like about the film. I thought that all of the principal characters, particularly the 1970's incarnations, were given good arcs. In particular, Charles Xavier and Mystique get the best such character moments. This is also welcome because previous installments relied too heavily on Wolverine, and while he is an important unifying force here, he isn't the primary focus. The minor characters, most of which are in the future scenes, don't get too much development but they get to show off their various powers, which were well-realized and cool to watch. Of course, I can't go without mentioning the best addition to the cast: Quicksilver. Even with his limited screen time, he establishes himself as what could become a fan favorite, and he has the film's best action sequence: a prison break at the Pentagon. Now, of course, movies can't all be visual effects and action, and this film, like the previous ones also has some other elements worthy of mention. Most notable is the use of time travel in an interesting way, and the idea that the future isn't set in stone. This is an interesting theme which hasn't been directly tackled in any prior X-Men film, and one that should resonate with all viewers. There are also the usual themes of people tapping into their better natures, and of civil rights. The only things I can find fault with is that for such an expansive storyline, it still felt like there were parts missing and the future scenes could have been beefed up a bit. I can't be the only person who wanted to spend just a little more time with the original cast before they're completely supplanted by the new, younger cast. I also wasn't as emotionally invested in this story as I was with X-Men: First Class, but I can't really say that's something you can necessarily blame the writer for. The story is just so large that it's nearly impossible to connect with it on anything but a general level. Still, the film was extremely well made in every respect."

","X-Men: Days of Future Past in the first part of the movie mutants travel through time and discovered a near-future in which both mutants and humans have been decimated by deadly killing machines known as The Sentinels. In this nightmarish period, Professor X and his ""old friend"" Magneto gather the most powerful surviving X-Men together for a effort to stop the Sentinel war: altering the past so that it never happened in the first place. That plan requires Kitty Pryde sending Wolverine's consciousness back into his 1970s body, in order to stop an event that forever sets history on the course of a dark future. But things are bleak in the past, as well the relationship between young Charles Xavier, Magneto and Mystique were all damaged .The events of the Cuban Missile Crisis (seen in X-Men: First Class) have already inspired the beginnings of the Sentinel program; and with every passing moment in the future, the Sentinels get closer to eliminating the last of the X-Men and destroying all hope of altering history.<br/><br/>At the center of this desperate mission lie some big questions: Can history be altered, or is destiny set in stone? And can Wolverine play the role of mentor to his own mentor in time to repair some very broken people and save two time lines?<br/><br/>On a directorial level, Bryan Singer has delivered his best film ever. Days of Future Past is a showcase of directorial talent .The futuristic world and mutant action sequences are awesome spectacle, while the future Sentinels are dark, frightening creatures; the '70s period piece is colorful, gleefully retro, and well-staged in nearly every scene; and there's an excellent character drama at the film's core, utilizing great actors who deliver performances above and beyond expectations. Like the direction, the script combines eclectic elements into a fine blend.<br/><br/>Then again, it's hard to complain about which characters are present or what state they're in when the cast of actors is delivering strong performances. Hugh Jackman leads the once again, but manages to be an effective team player this time. His performance is much more restrained, drawing on Wolverine's extensive history in the previous movies to create an interesting spin on the character as an older and wiser mentor. The First Class squad – Charles Xavier, Magneto, Mystique and Beast – deliver even more of the best elements to this film.<br/><br/>In the end, X-Men: Days of Future Past succeeds at being a thrilling and fun superhero movie, balanced by well-earned dramatic weight.

","I didn't really expect too much from this film, but I had to see it, as I have watched all X-men movies and some of the cartoons. I am not a hard core fan, but I know a thing or two about the X universe. That is why I think the film, while good enough, will be harder to digest for casual movie goers.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the attempt to change the fate of the human mutant war by sending Wolverine's consciousness into the past to prevent the one event that causes that war to begin with. Peter Dinklage's character is the inventor of the Sentinels, the dreaded anti-mutant robots and his murder at the hand of Mystique was the original trigger for the Sentinel program and the war. Now Professor X, Magneto, Beast and Wolverine need to prevent it.<br/><br/>I liked that the Sentinels were really presented as terrifying. The character's shenanigans were less impressive, since most of their efforts were spent contradicting and even battling each other, which makes the whole premise of the film moot. Also the disgusting light filter they used at the end to show that ""all is well"" didn't sit well with me. The actors played well and even Wolverine certainly looked and acted better than in the horrible Wolverine movie. They completely ignored any law of causality in their interpretation of time travel as well.<br/><br/>Bottom line: fantastic actors like McAvoy, Fasbender and Dinklage have to do roles that are kind of silly. The movie is not bad, though, I would even call it engaging. However the unexplained details of the film could push casual viewers away.

It's good fun, mostly, and it's pretty entertaining for the most part. The cast is fine, but James McAvoy is the one that really stands out in a better way than the rest, infusing something into his role that he didn't in the first.

","""X-Men: Days of Future Past is a well-polished action vehicle that fits nicely into this franchise's canon of films, but it is by no means groundbreaking (Bennett)."" This quote describes ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" perfectly, in saying that nothing really awed the crowd, and ultimately the movie was nothing more than above average due to its' typical and original storyline and outcome. <br/><br/>The story kicks off in a corrupted future world with a mass killing spree of future mutants deliberated by giant robots, called Sentinels. These Sentinels were created for the purpose of hunting down mutants that were programed by the government and made its' debut in 1973. As the future mutants reappear from the dead, from the powers of Kitty Pryde, they then get reinforcements from the original X-Men crew and altogether come up with a plan to send Logan back in the past to prevent the Sentinels becoming a government-sanctioned weapon to begin with. These Sentinels were designed with a specific and rare type of DNA that belonged to Raven (better known as Mystique) who was killed in trying to stop the creation of the Sentinels in 1973 as well. Raven's strategy was to assassinate Bolivar Trask, the creator of the Sentinels, in hoping that this would then stop the creation of the Sentinels but essentially Raven was captured and killed and now her powers live on through the Sentinels. Logan is then sent back to the past to stop Raven's plan and overall stop her from killing Trask while destroying the creation of the Sentinels. <br/><br/>Just how all superhero movies end, the main conflict would of course be resolved by not assassinating Trask and by causing a menace throughout the finale setting off the perspective of the Sentinels as a disaster. The movie overall however was interesting and its' most fascinating part would consist of the time travel. Bryan Singer, the director, created a very old and yet antique looking Paris where one of the meetings of Trask's Sentinels took place. This scene was then disrupted by Logan accompanied by younger Xavier and Magneto. However the intriguing part consisted of a live television news scene that displays the madness between the mutants and the armed officials surrounded by local pedestrians. This live news set presented the mutants as a threat to the world which generally created the perspective to increase the production of Sentinels, leading to the movie's climax. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the only key character flaws would be younger Xavier's character, James McAvoy. He was not part of the action while the present and older Xavier did more action and played more of a character with him sitting this one out most of the time. Younger Xavier was a main character of this movie but yet he only would use his powers once or twice. Singer's plot for younger Xavier was to be more inspirational and motivational, where he would make speeches that got boring with really quick. In addition, throughout the finale he was absent due to being stuck under a piece of metal where Magneto dominated him as his arch-enemy. However, the other characters were realistic and credible which is why the movie picked up in the end. <br/><br/>Overall, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is still a fun and family movie to watch however compared to its' other collection is it not one of the best. Bryan Singer's best aspect seemed to be that he was able to contrast and show that he had a grip and assurance of what his characters would do. Yet with young Xavier dealing with personal problems throughout the movie was somewhat of a disappointed from the previous movie of ""X-Men First Class"" where he played an exceptional part of displaying his powers as well as being a key part to the other main characters."

","This movie kind of puts the X-Men continuity into weird territory. First Class made me care more about the characters than all but the very best stories from the comics. In this movie, we go back and forth between the young X-Men of Matthew Vaughn's film and the dismal looking Bryan Singer group. I'd rather just follow the story from where Vaughn left off. This movie starts in the furthest future of the team, as the sentinels have just about killed off every mutant. Professor X and Magneto join together to send Wolverine to the past and get everyone to work together to stop the darkest timeline. What I cared about most in this story is the redemption it kept teasing for Eric and Raven. Every scene she was in, I kept wanting her to change her mind and come back with Charles. There was even a line from the future Magneto as he was dying where he regrets all the years they fought each other. That was what I wanted to see most--everyone finally realize they would be better off working together. But these are stubborn characters and we will have to wait for the next movie to know if it works out. It will be hard to care about X-Men: Apocalypse if we don't get to see the cast from First Class again, but I am interested to see where it goes."
"TheMarwood","7","0","1","3 July 2014"," Bryan Singer gets this series back on track
","After Singer's last film, the box office fiasco and poorly done Jack the Giant Slayer, Singer shows a command of his craft that has been missing from his big budget work since he left this series in X2. The film starts out in a hostile future where the robotic Sentinels hunt down and wipe out what's left of the mutants. Either this film is purposely ignoring most of X3: The Last Stand or there's some glaring continuity oversights in this series, such as Professor X being alive in this grim future. But Days of Future past has a strong enough narrative to stand on its own, so it's easy to ignore events from the previous entries without impacting this film. Things get going when Wolverine is sent back to the 70s to seek the aid of a younger Professor X and Magneto to change the course of history. Even with crossover casting, time travel and mutants entrenched in powerful political positions, Days of Future Past is remarkably straight forward and well written and never gets convoluted with so many characters and plot threads. The money spent is up there on the screen and even with this colossal budget, the effects and action set pieces aren't overproduced, but remarkably well rendered and the period detail is more than convincing. The 3D was adequate, but didn't add anything to the experience except a few extra dollars to the ticket - two dimensions are more than enough for Days of Future Past."

","The X men are struggling for survival in a future battle against sentinels. In order to win this battle they need to go back in time to stop the original development of sentinels.<br/><br/>This is a fairly typical time travel plot. Normally you end up thinking about things that don't quite work with the timeline, but that certainly isn't a problem with X Men Days of Future Past. The film is pretty entertaining from start to finish. I don't think I'm giving too much away to also mention that there's a great advantage to the series in this storyline. If you change things in the past everything is reset for the present - everyone can either live or die and their characters can also be totally different. A great way to reboot a series without having to get a completely fresh cast!! It's a pretty entertaining movie as well as we expect from an X men movie."

"DareDevilKid","9","0","1","12 June 2014"," Another Golden Entrant in the Sterling X-Men Legacy
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4.2/5 stars<br/><br/>If there's been one film franchise that has stood the test of time and successfully maintained the superior echelons it set for itself among the plethora of superhero films out there, (barring an incongruously disappointing third installment) right from the time it debuted (I'm not taking the Wolverine spin-offs into account), then it's got to be the ""X-Men"" chronology. In keeping with the rich vein of this adrenaline- pumping, prudently-executed franchise, Bryan Singer (back after directing the first two films that actually set the bar for all superhero films long before Marvel came and raised it a bit higher) weaves another richly-plotted, astutely-directed, high on testosterone film that pulls you into its adventurous journey and keeps you so engrossed that you'll end up wishing that the movies never gets over. Very few films have managed to achieve this in recent times, and the only other such spectacle that comes to mind from this year's lot is ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"".<br/><br/>""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" brings together the ultimate X-Men ensemble and pits them in a war for the survival of their species across two time periods. The beloved characters from the original ""X-Men"" film trilogy battle a new breed of mechanical foes known as the ""sentinels"", while their younger selves from the ""X-Men: First Class"", race against time to thwart to change a major historical event and fight in an epic battle that could save our future. The X-Men send Wolverine to the past to meet up with Charles X. Xavier and Magneto's younger selves in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants.<br/><br/>This could have ended up looking extremely shoddy in the hands of a lesser Director, but Bryan Singer brings all his expertise and dexterity to the fore, and ends up creating a masterpiece that's as high on its visual razzmatazz as it is on the sheer brilliance of deftly handling the intricacies of a complex storyline with multiple character arcs. As a viewer, you never end up being confounded at any point in the film and end up insatiably lapping up all the minute details of this time-bending plot. Along with Singer's assured direction, kudos must also be bestowed upon writers Simon Kinberg (screenplay), Jane Goldman, Simon Kinberg, and Matthew Vaughn's detailed story, which neatly brought all the intricacies together like a neat jigsaw puzzle, and also to Simon Kinberg for converting this story into a blockbuster screenplay. Newton Thomas Sigel's awe-inspiring cinematography and the astute editing by John Ottman and Michael Louis Hill are the icing and cherry on this scrumptious three-tier cake. <br/><br/>Coming to the performances, all the main characters are by now well- versed with their roles and by the looks of it seemed to be having a blast in front of the camera. Understandably, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Ellen Page, and Shawn Ashmore have lesser screen time as the plot is mostly centered around the timeline in the past and how drastic measures need to be taken to change it and forever alter the calamity of the future. Nevertheless, whenever the erstwhile mentioned cast is on screen, they pull off their characters with the energy and approach demanded of them. The actual field is laid out for the cast from the previous film, ""X-Men: First Class"", and the players including James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, and Nicholas Hoult more than live up to expectations. Indubitably, Hugh Jackman is the star of the show over here and he gets to play ball in both timelines in a role he can by now sleepwalk through, and as usual he bring all the chutzpah, bravado, and machismo, and unabashedness that has endeared us over the years to his portrayal of Wolverine. Evan Peters - as the fledgling, cocky Quicksilver - and Peter Dinklage - as the vile, bigoted, manipulative business magnate and misguided scientist, Dr. Bolivar Trask - are marvelous additions to the cast.<br/><br/>With heart-pounding action, grandiose set pieces, dazzling visual effects, chuckle-inducing one-liners, endearing characters, and an intricate plot helmed by brilliant direction; ""X-Men: Days of Future Past is certainly one of the most lavishly assembled and thoroughly entertaining summer blockbusters in recent memory. This ""X-Men"" franchise is well-alive and kicking vigorously, which almost makes us rub our palms in glee like a kid on Christmas Eve in anticipation of what the next installment shall bring to the table. Don't make us wait to long Mr. Singer and 20th Century Fox; bring it on as quick as possible."

","The original DOFP story was originally a two issue comic back in 1980, however it feels like it was dreamed up especially to solve the problem the studio faced after 2011's X-Men: First Class: what to do with a franchise that has been split into two time lines with two sprawling casts – the originals (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan etc.) and the younger iterations (James Mcavoy, Michael Fassbender et all.) <br/><br/>DOFP begins in 2023 with a voice-over from Professor X as he explains mutants are on the verge of extinction and asks ""is our future truly set?"" This is followed by a fantastic action sequence involving characters both old (Magneto, Storm, Colossus, Wolverine) and new (Blink, Bishop, Warpath) against a mass of unstoppable Sentinel robots that have been created specifically to destroy mutants. It is simply a breathtaking display of action cinema. <br/><br/>The only way, it seems, to prevent mutant extinction is to send Wolverine back in time to his 1973 body to prevent the war before it begins. Charged with stopping Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from assassinating weapons-maker Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) – the event which will result in global annihilation, Wolverine is hampered by obstacles – his claws are no longer metal, Professor X is a depressive alcoholic without his powers and he also has to seek the help of Magneto who is being held captive in an unbreakable plastic prison beneath the Pentagon. This is undoubtedly one of the highlights of DOFP as speedster Quicksilver is recruited to assist the team in the breakout. <br/><br/>The film slows down half way as it develops the characters but focuses specifically on the relationships between Professor X, Magneto and Mystique and their quest to prevent the doom that lay before them and all the ""What Ifs"" that are presented. With time travel films there are always questions that don't get answered thoroughly but it's a fresh idea that both past and future time lines are allowed to coincide at the same time. <br/><br/>The original characters are utilized well in the future setting and the new characters are blended in seamlessly with the story. The music is excellent and the special effects are superb - Singer has put every cent of his $250m on screen for the audience to enjoy.<br/><br/>In short DOFP is far more sophisticated and has the best and most complex story of any X-Men movie to date. Be sure to stay until after the credits for a glimpse of 2016's sequel X-Men: Apocalypse. X well and truly marks the spot!"
"reececoupland","10","0","2","11 June 2014"," One Of The Best Movies There Is!
","Now I am a big fan of the X-Men films but began to be disappointed with the series towards the end (X-Men Origins & The Wolverine) this is probably down to the lack of character building on some of the most well known Marvel characters and the bad continuity of the previous films. But X-Men Days Of Future Past managed to make the X-Men films great again. In the apocalyptic world ran by Sentinels, Kitty sends Wolverine's consciousness back into his younger body in the 70's to stop Trask from creating the machines and uses Mystique's DNA to make the Sentinels able to adapt to the mutants powers. The film brings back all the best and favorite Mutants such as Storm, Beast, Iceman etc. and also brings to life some of the best Mutants such as Quick Silver and Bishop, but are barely featured in the movie but when they are they stand out and make the scenes great. I just hope they appear again in X-Men Apocalypse. Once the film had reached its climax it is seen when Wolverine wakes up in his body again, he has fixed (therefore cutting out all the previous films X-Men, X2, The Last Stand and Origins, only leaving First Class) the future bringing all the dead, Jean & Scott back to life as well as creating the new Villain which is seen in the post end credits (Apocalypse, moving the pyramids and ending on his Grey pale face looking at the camera, this makes me ready to see and very impatient for the new movie) Although I am a Marvel film fan and my opinion would be more biased towards the film I feel it connect with all film fans, having humor, actions, emotion and a great story behind it. <br/><br/>The only problems I have with the film is the continuity between this film and The Wolverine, at the end of the Wolverine, Wolverine has his bone claws from after the Silver Samurai cuts the claws off, but then at the beginning of days of future past he has the Adamantium claws back. Also how is The Professor ALIVE?! I love having him back in the franchise but it hasn't been explained how he returned, I don't blame this down to Brain Singer's directing but the previous directors that made a poor continuation of his work. Another thing that has got to me, which has nothing to do with the film in general, but they included Quick Silver in this film as he is a Mutant and the son of Magneto, but him and his sister, Scarlet Witch are going to be in the new Avengers, The films are either crossing over or are mixing up the two worlds and using Characters from X-Men in the Avengers world.<br/><br/>All in all this film was a brilliant piece of work, great cast from both prequels and originals, great action, humor and story line."
"wparbowo","9","0","2","9 June 2014"," The best X-Men movie ever created
","X-Men: Days of Future Past is the last movie I watched in theater, so I figure I'll start with this one. The first thing I want to say is, I love superhero movies, even though I don't read all the comics, I do love the movies.<br/><br/>I've seen all the X-Men movies, and what I don't like about X-Men movies is the lack of consistency. So, to enjoy this movie you just have to take what you think is good and forget about those aren't consistent. Because I think only X-Men: First Class is the only prequel that go along with the storyline, but if you haven't seen the other movies you can't enjoy the full potential of this one.<br/><br/>Despite all the controversy about this movie and not so convincing trailer, Days of future past is a great movie to watch, I definitely had a good time. It started strong with future scene of the X-Men universe and it has those saddening tune along the movie. It has action from various character that you always wanted from X-Men universe of course, humor that will make you chuckle here and there, and the plot of the movie, I enjoy the story. It has a nice pace that make you stay focus to the screen. The cast and crew definitely did a good job.<br/><br/>For the next movie(s), I hope they hold the consistency and make an even better piece than this one. With a strong story, fun, and doesn't left the audience with unanswered questions. Of course they like to leave them to the audience's imagination but I still think It's better to have the answer even if it's hidden somewhere in the movie, I hate a plot hole.<br/><br/>The best X-Men movie ever created, so far..."

I had seen the movie 5 times. It is action movie. It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense.

"swasthegr8","8","0","2","7 June 2014"," Another masterpiece by Bryan Singer
","First of all, many thanks to the director Bryan Singer who again directed the X-men franchise after a hiatus of a decade. X-men Days Of Future Past succeeds over its prequels which had some flaws in it. The main characters are well defined in this multistarrer movie. Jennifer Lawrence's character Mystique had more screen space this time. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender both did incredible job reprising their roles as younger Charles and Eric respectively.Veteran actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen played their part well. Their presence added weight to the screen. Among other actors Peter Dinkage was noticeable who was seen in a new role after portraying as Tyrion Lannister in HBO's Game Of Thrones. And finally, our clawed hero Logan aka Wolverine Hugh Jackman looked bigger with his sturdy torso.A couple of things I noticed is Logan wore sunglasses which is unusual and had his signature hairstyle as he had in X- men trilogy films. A must watch for X- men movie fans. P.S. - Hope that more swashbuckling sequels of X-men will release soon."
"dimevulture1972","8","0","2","7 June 2014"," Recommended to fans and strangers alike.
","Acting: Why is Patrick Stewart in this movie? First off, do I even have to comment on the alumni of this film? Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. Patrick Stewart is Professor X. Ian McKellen is Magneto. Got it? Okay. The acting in this film is solid for the most part. James McAvoy does a good job at portraying young Xavier as an intelligent and sympathetic character that, while not endowed with his future self's wisdom and virtue, doesn't succumb to the unbearable immaturity that we so often find with younger versions of characters. I'm aware that he was in First Class, but I never watched it. It honestly took a while for me to buy Michael Fassbender as Magneto, but he eventually settled right with me. I'm also aware that he was in First Class, but, like I said, I never watched it. Up next, and probably the one who stole the show, was Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique. Okay, Mystique was awesome in the cartoons, but that hasn't been so well represented as it is here. Mystique pretty much serves as the McGuffin of the film, which in turn puts more focus on Lawrence's performance. She's gorgeous, she's brutal, she's caring, she won't listen to what you have to say, she's vulnerable and she's deadly as. All of this and more is shown in her performance. I don't know what she's doing with that Hunger Games series, but she needs to be in more X-Men films. Does she personify Mystique completely? Eh... not quite. I recall Mystique having a definite maternal quality in the cartoons, which may very well develop with more films, but she doesn't quite have that as of yet. From her portrayal here, though, I could easily make the mental connection through time. Last I'm gonna touch on is Nicholas Hoult as Beast. Not the greatest, really. Not terrible, but not all that good. Acting: 8/10<br/><br/>Writing: Why is Professor X in this movie? I know, I already mentioned that, but Singer made it a point to legitimize TLS as canon. Plot holes be damned, let's move on. As the name suggests, this is a time travel film. As with any time-based film, the science of how time travel works is a bit fuzzy, but it manages to make enough sense in the context of the film. I mean, if Catwoman can control the weather, I think we can accept the transferring of consciousness through time as a thing. The plot of the film is competent and doesn't linger too much, but I would've liked a couple sequences to go on a little longer. An example would be the subplot with Xavier's mutant power suppressant. We have two scenes on it, but that's pretty much it. It's somewhat referenced in a later scene involving Cerebro, but it's still fairly inconsequential. Most of the dialog was solid, so I have no real complaints there. The plot itself, as I said, is competent and easy to understand. It's a well-written story that I feel serves the purpose of being accessible to Marvel fans that want to see X-Men characters do X-Men character things and casual moviegoers that may just want to be entertained. The story doesn't take too many twists and turns, but I really liked it for what it was. Writing: 7.5/10<br/><br/>Aesthetics: The effects in this film were pretty much what you'd expect from a big budget film brought to you by 20th Century Fox. They were good, but that's par for the course. If they were bad, it would be criminal. Something I feel I should give a nod to is the music, though. Days Of Future Past is solid in the sound department and features the score from the previous X-Men films. It's nostalgic and adds more to the aesthetic of the film. Short and sweet, it's nice to look at and the quality visuals are enhanced by proficient sound design. Aesthetics: 7/10<br/><br/>Action: The action in Days Of Future Past isn't what I'd call remarkable, but it's definitely enhanced by the film's pacing. It's no rare occurrence for there to be ten to fifteen minutes without a noteworthy battle, but those that happen just serve to have more of an impact. I'd call this more of a skirmish film. While there may be several ""action"" scenes interspersed throughout, they're relatively low-key and based more on tension than outright frantic testosterone. A decent amount of focus is given to stealth, so the bigger events are that much more satisfying. One that comes to mind is the occasional cut to the future where the last of the X-Men try desperately to defend their fortification from Sentinels. We are treated to some awesome fights there. Magneto shows us why he's the coolest comic book villain Marvel has to offer, Bishop blasts away everything in his path and Colossus does battle like a boss. All that's cool, but I was most impressed by the girl with the gateway powers. She was hardcore and made many of the action scenes as special as they were. When she did her thing, I was like ""yeah! You go, Portal chick!"" I think her name's Blink, but I'm not sure. Action: 8<br/><br/>Appeal To Marvel Fans: Pretty much the most important part for any film is its appeal to its target demographic. As I've said, we have a decent amount of X-Men characters on display. Some better than others, but we are given at least a glimpse at most of our favorites. My only real complaint is that there was no Gambit. That's a downer, as he's my favorite. The presentation and tone of the film looks and feels like an X-Men movie, which is a definite plus. I feel this will please most X-Men fans, so I'd call it a successful film to say the least. It's nice to see Bryan Singer back at the helm of the franchise, as he's done wonders so far. Appeal: 8.5"
"vitalstatics","10","0","3","7 June 2014"," The best X-men ever. DO NOT miss it
","I went for the 3D version (would you rather watch b&w TV?) for obvious reasons, and it was insane. This is the first X-men that really really intrigued and immersed me into the action and found the story complex, yet easy to understand. It's not trying to be over complex and confuse the audience so that they are in awe of the movie, but end up not figuring out anything. <br/><br/>The only part just before the end got a little monotonous and some parts needed further explanation. <br/><br/>I think Peter Dinklage is an unbelievable actor, and love his roles. The producers/directors could have used his talents a little more by making his role more witty and intelligent (not denying that it wasn't already).<br/><br/>I can compare this to Iron Man, and that's saying a lot."
"xmichaelraine","8","0","1","6 June 2014"," Very Solid Entry in The X-Men Universe
","We're 7 films in now into this world. And with 2 more on the way, it goes without saying that they're staying afloat by sheer demand from fans. There are a lot of people out there that are die hard 'X-men' fans, just like any other comic book series has. Some of the films are notably better than others. And while there are plot holes galore here (Yes they are plot holes I don't care what you tell me), and I don't think it's better than the latest 'Captain America' or 'X-Men II: X-Men United' for that matter; This movie is full blown turned up to 100 from the get go, with well executed action scenes, a lot of humor in the right places, and a HUGELY talented cast all giving good performances.<br/><br/>The start of the film shows Earth as a desolate wasteland, thanks to the savage hunting machines known as the Sentinels. Originally created to hunt down and destroy only Mutants, the machines had since evolved in the future and began hunting anyone. So we see all of our favorite mutated heroes return and try to figure a way that can go back in time and prevent one of their own Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from executing the inventor of the Sentinels Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). By preventing this event, it will reverse history so that humans will never decide to use the Sentinels to destroy mutants. And with one of many plot conveniences Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is the only X-Men that can go back in time to reunite young Xavier (James McAvoy) and young Eric aka. Magneto (Michael Fassbender) in order to create a new better future for everyone.<br/><br/>The volume of superhero films we get these days has made them become underwhelming to me for the most part. Rest assured though that this is one of the most solid entries in recent memory. Surprisingly the thing I enjoyed the most is the clever humor written into the script. There are hat tips to the previous films quite frequently yet I feel that this film is trying very hard to separate itself from them. The story builds to what an obvious leap into a brand new storyline. With 2 more films already in production this is no surprise.<br/><br/>Along with the humor, there are a few sequences of action that are extremely impressive. Especially a sequence with the character Quicksilver (Evan Peters) that I will claim is one of the most impressive sequences of ANY action film in the last 15 years. It really is that good. The most simple and honest way I could describe the film is, fun. Even if you're not a die hard fan, there's a lot you can enjoy in the film. A movie with a cast this stacked and a director who is familiar with the loire and characters, would be hard pressed to make a movie that wouldn't be an enjoyable time.<br/><br/>A problem I have with the film is it's lack of sensitivity to a younger audience. I mean, this isn't something I would usually talk about in relevance to a comic book film, however there's noticeable points in the film I thought to myself ""Woah now, ease up a bit"". A totally unnecessary F-bomb to start, which yes is a critique for a superhero movie. You'll have a great amount of young children attending this movie, they don't need to see superheroes dropping F-bombs. Also there's a weird script element in which the Charles Xavier and Hank aka Beast characters inject a serum of some sorts into themselves to keep their mutant powers at bay and to live more normally. What bothers me about it is that it subconsciously hints towards using heroin, as you literally see the characters tying bands around their arm in a panic and injecting themselves into their veins as if they're thriving for the serum. A tad inappropriate in my eyes, as there were numerous children under the age of 10 in the screening I was in and I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable watching those moments.<br/><br/>Nitpicks aside there is no denying the film is greatly enjoyable. Wonderful actors giving it their all, and there's plenty of exciting moments equally balanced with emotional engagement and laughter. I can't rave on and on about how incredible it is because for one I'm not an avid die hard fan, and two it's not all that incredible. Just very well done; nothing we haven't seen before. Some have said it's one of the greatest super hero movies of all time which is in my mind a bit of a stretch. In comparison to some of the other films in this universe that have been dismal to say the least, it is definitely a breath of fresh air. It's not greatly profound however; Rather a nice flavor of the moment."

"harold-19-577690","10","0","3","5 June 2014"," The best X men movie yet, by far
","The best X-men movie yet, by far<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I left a movie theatre simply too stunned for words, I think it was ""Inception"", 2010. <br/><br/>The writers have pulled out all the stops here and meshed together THE best comic storyline adaptation I've seen bar none. Growing up in the nineties, waking up on a Saturday morning, the one and only cartoon to look out for was X-men, so I think I can say I'm biased toward the franchise, but with good reason; the storywriters have produced something with so much depth and complexity that makes other comic film adaptations look, basically, for kids. OK, I enjoyed ""The Avengers"" as well, don't get me wrong.<br/><br/>5 movies, 1 original comic story, weaved together by perhaps the strongest cast available. Perhaps it just me, but ever since ""The Matrix"", action movies have basically been ""same same, but different"". What people crave is stories, and what a story this is. <br/><br/>How can I describe it? The fact that after what I consider was the worst Wolverine movie (Yes, ""The Wolverine"" was horribly disappointing), Hugh Jackman has finally got Wolverine (aka Logan) down. Perhaps his own experience playing him, along with the requirements of the movie for a more mature Wolverine, really come together here. A lead supporting actor. Is it even possible? Yes, somehow Hugh Jackman has pulled it off. Like the other veterans in the movie (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan) he's brought something tangible, credible and humble to the ensemble.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Peter Dinklage, Halle Berry, Bingbing Fan... you know what, I could go on praising this cast for another 1000 words, however I'm going to stop now.<br/><br/>OK, let me rewind a little, 5 movies, one comic arc.<br/><br/>Five movies? X-men, X-men 2, X-men – Last stand, X- men origins – Wolverine and X-men – First class. <br/><br/>1 comic arc? #141 – 142 Chris Claremont, John Byrneand Terry Austin. 1981. <br/><br/>OK, so the comic speaks for itself. But how about the movies? Well, firstly the actors, for the most part, there are the same actors from all five of those movies featured in ""X-men – Days of Future Past"". This is a fantastic bit of casting. It gives so much more credibility to different actors playing the same characters across time. Next; flashback sequences. Third; inferences from the characters themselves. This mash up, so seamlessly knitted with both subtle and overt political references, personal tragedy, friendship, betrayal, unrequited love and, of course, the Michael Bay style action sequences we've come to love and expect from our favourite X-men movies.<br/><br/>OK a quick word on powers. Some superhero movies (especially in my opinion ""Superman"" movies) play down the powers of their heroes. Not in an X-men movie. Not in THE X-men movie. We all know Magneto is awesome. We all know The Professor is awesome. And we all enjoy seeing Wolverine rip someone a new one. Here in ""X-men Days of Future Past"" we get to see their awesomeness, but flawed. Flawed in their physical weaknesses, flawed in their selfish desires, flawed in their humanity. This does wonders for the movie. It creates a dynamic which accentuates the lighter parts and allows for the action sequences to have greater impact. What Bryan Singer has managed to do is create a symphony; complete with prelude, development, low dark tones interspersed with lighter ones, building up into a colossal cacophony, rising into a crescendo and concluding with style. <br/><br/>Needless to say, I've got to see the next one."

","As the series of X-Men franchises was incepted in 2000, it gained immense popularity among movie goers globally. Thanks to the reboot X- Men: First Class, expectations doubled and with combined power and all the characters in one movie, X-Men: Days of Future Past will blow your mind with spectacular CGI and likable story.<br/><br/>After being threatened by man-made machine, X:Men must travel back to the past to change the fate of both mutants and humans.<br/><br/>From the acclaimed director who started the franchise, Bryan Singer goes one step forward and vastly improves his narration style as compared to the previous X: Men series. The movie is catchy right from the beginning and you will be sucked into the stunning screenplay that you will not realize how the time flew. The highlight of the film is definitely the rescue scene of Erik from highly guarded security which is beautifully shot, introduction of Wolverine and Mystic and finally the climax parliament scene which is completely action packed. Dialogues are punching, cinematography is breath-taking , editing could have been better, visual-effects are stunning. It is difficult to point which actor gave the best performance as I believe equal justice was given to each character. Hugh Jackman , Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender and James Mcvoy were dependable.<br/><br/>Overall, X-Men: Days of Future Past should be immensely likable for its brilliant performances, enthralling CGI. Excellent 4.5 / 5<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk"

","I was not happy with the trailer. But when i watched this movie i was like wow... Bryan again proved he is one of the best. I am of the fan of his movie usual suspect. This movie is worth to watch. But keep it mind there will be no Goosebumps action, but the action which is in the movie drive u somewhere. Bryan went this time more of story than action. Brilliant screenplay which will give u a clear picture of what's going instead of confusing what is happening. The way he portrayed every character is awesome. Then about CG is nicely done, giving support to the dark screenplay. There is no much space for Hugh Jackman even though he moves the screenplay. Every one gave his best in their characters. Cinematography is wonderful. The young Charles rocks, and holding the story. There is some humor in the movie which is nicely blended. I could have gave 10 because of climax its 9. I expected more than this. Sorry my bad. Overall its awesome and brilliant from Bryan. Waiting for the sequel."

","I found this movie to be one of the best X Men movies they have done so far. I was one of the people who watch the cartoons. In the cartoon episodes they did an actual series on the Sentinels. And it was quite good. So to actually see a live action movie with a good plot and followed pretty much the same theme was a delight. I guess the thing I'm most happy about is the plot was really good it wasn't aimless and far- reaching. The characters were developed and played out there roll just as we do in real life. I was always told by my brother a comic book fan that really and truly the X Men were a soap opera for people who don't actually like to watch the ones on TV. But I would say I like this movie so much I would watch it again. I really wish what they did with this movie they had done in the beginning with Jean and did the Phoenix series. But alas they didn't and at least this was well done. I've always liked Mystique and thought they developed her character quite well for a change. If you read her history in Marvel she is definitely more than meets the eye. Glad to see they finally got it right I would tell any comic book fan to go see it."

At all times the history maintains a logical line of events and consequences for the mutants. The characters are well embedded in the argument and no appearance looks forced or impair the development of the story. In terms of performance, we can see many pleasant things, since they have been delving into this aspect. In fact, the emotional touch and retrospective is more elaborate and detailed than in previous films in the series X. Special effects and the resources actually used serve their purpose.

","BY RYAN C. SHOWERS<br/><br/>I never cared much for the ""X-Men"" film series with their silly transformations and ""cool"" special effects, but I found myself intrigued and captivated by the latest installment, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past."" Bryan Singer returns to his role as director and pursues a deft vision that translates to a clean, organized superhero flick. ""Days of Future Past"" both stands as a staple of technical adeptness and shoots gratifying bullets of adrenaline for those paying for the entertainment. <br/><br/>The screenplay avails its twisty concepts, fastens tight a sturdy structure, and wins the audience's interest with a developed plot. Its swift beating tone keeps the project going at an advanced, adaptable rhythm. An ""X-Men"" movie holds some of the most poignant, intense, and copacetic scenes of the year so far...who would have known?<br/><br/>The creative and technical team behind ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" climb to the brim of quality action filmmaking and maintain high standards throughout the two hour film. The film editing is the first thing noticed in opening fight sequence, a scene which made me sit back in my seat and mumble ""wow"" to myself as at the sharp, charged cuts. The art department showcases pleasing neon blue and purple colors that contrast with the ample black space in the scenes taking place in present time, which flatters the look of the film.<br/><br/>""Days of Future Past"" reminds me in more than a few ways of Christopher Nolan's monstrous 2010 hit ""Inception."" An action film that takes itself seriously and respects the sanctity of the motion picture process are most basic ways the two films are alike, but specific aesthetic features and narrative structure overlap between them as well. It's as if Singer and company had a group viewing of ""Inception"" before beginning preproduction and used the Academy Award winning film as its muse. The way it is written (multiple time dimensions, the plot hinging on a ghostly femme fatal from the past), cut (aligning time periods action scenes), and shot (Quicksilver's racing speed distorts gravity as Arthur's gravity-less hotel sequence from Inception) all breathe like an homage to ""Inception,"" which is a complimentary observation.<br/><br/>The vastly talented array of A-listers entertain and revel in their characters effortlessly. With pretentious egos aside, the actors to deliver the resilient superheroes in full form. Hugh Jackman, while not very complex, relishes in leading the pack as Wolverine, Jennifer Lawrence adds another valuable blockbuster to her resume as Mystique, and Michael Fassbender coerces blood into Magneto. James McAvoy is the acting standout by threading Professor Charles Xavier with a sore backstory. It's impressive to see the cast in the film, even with these crucial four aside, for just the sake gathering so many highly regarded thespians into one genre picture.<br/><br/>The exorbitant fan expectation is just as high as they were for the first sequel in 2003, yet after seven films X-Men surmounts any conjecture surmised by eager fans. ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" may sound like a drag (literally, the title sounds reductive and crude), but it's a technical marvel with an absorbing story and characters.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.8<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

It was about who the characters are, and how the characters define themselves. This was especially seen with the character Mystique, and was adapted brilliant.

"kunalkhandwala","9","0","1","2 June 2014"," Compelling tale of Mutant survival
","When one combines the idea of time-travel by a mutant with a generation-spanning multi- star cast, through times dark and culture-shifting, against forces incomprehensible and daunting, with a Lannister creating quite a stir on the other side, you know this isn't just a summer action movie. In this chaotic Marvelverse, Bryan Singer ('X-Men', 'X-Men 2') overcomes his follies of 'Superman Returns' and 'Valkyrie' to give us a finely convoluted extravaganza that picks up from where the well revived 'X-Men: First Class' left us. Based around real world events in epic proportions, 'Days of Future Past' is a compelling tale of the survival of mutants in a world that grows increasingly hostile towards them. The action is spectacular and the plot allows for enough sly humor and human emotion that has always been at the forefront of the mutant psychology. With a multitude of characters and constant transitions between the past and future, one should be well versed with the mutants from the earlier X-Men films as well as from 'First Class' to maintain sanity during the riveting proceedings. <br/><br/>The future is dark and lingers with the threat of annihilation of the mutant race by the Sentinels. These robotic creations honor the legacy of Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage), whose program to combat the mutant threat was seen through fruition by the Government. After tremendous loss and relentless fighting, the remaining mutants gather for a last resort that involves Kitty's ability to project a person's consciousness to their past selves so warnings and messages can be conveyed. Due to his self-healing powers that could withstand such time travel, Wolverine is sent back to 1973 to prevent Mystique from murdering Trask. It was his death and the research of her powers upon capture, that led to the launch of the Sentinel program. Wolverine, guided by Charles Sr. and Magento Sr. must find their younger selves and with their assistance, prevent Mystique from triggering their own devastation. Young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is confined within the most secure facility from where escape is impossible. Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is busy saving the army recruited mutants from their imminent capture by Trask's forces in Saigon while Logan (Hugh Jackman) finally convinces the young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) of his plan to save the future. With the help of the speedster Quicksilver, they are able to free Magneto from Pentagon's impenetrable facility in what is perhaps the most dazzling slow motion sequence that is as thrilling as it is amusing. <br/><br/>Their combined forces intercept Mystique in Paris and thwart her attack on Trask but her injury led to the discovery of her blood stain that was then seized by Trask's security. The result of these events was that humans perceived the mutants to be a threat and the Sentinel project came closer to implementation with her vital DNA. Eventually, the Sentinels are revealed by Trask at the White House in an event but not before Magneto had inserted shards of metal into the robots that were in transit. Charles must thus confront his pain and regain his powers to prevent Mystique from committing a public murder which would forever make mutants the enemy of human-kind. In this process, he even confronts his older and wiser self who guides his conscience to pursue peace for the future of the mutants which again makes an epic moment in the film. On the other hand, Magneto lifts an entire stadium to create a barricade around the White House to prevent any escape of Trask. Meanwhile, in a last hopeless stand, the mutants come together to face their doom with the arrival of the Sentinel army that threatens to disrupt Wolverine's conscience from achieving its objective in the past.<br/><br/>There is just so much going on with the multitude of characters that action cannot overpower the events and yet it remains spectacular owing to their superpowers and the destruction causing Sentinels. Magneto's stadium sequence is another CGI marvel and so is the stand-off against the final Sentinel assault. But the most remarkable sequence is of course the one where Quicksilver (Evans Peter) puts on some music and casually runs around the kitchen in slow motion, changing the postures of shooters and re-aligning fired bullets, all at an unreal speed. <br/><br/>Performances by the entire cast are sublime and Hugh Jackman truly seems to enjoy his meaty role more than his independent Wolverine series. James McAvoy and Fassbender are very impressive as the young Charles and Magneto, yet again, while we get to see very little of the costumed or disguised Jennifer Lawrence to even judge her performance. Peter Dinklage is left underutilized for his standards. Sir Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart are exemplary in their characters even after years of absence as X-Men leaders. Overall, it is just sensational to witness the entire cast from both periods come together in one movie. <br/><br/>Bryan Singer rises above all the X-Men installments with the most humanly felt story of mutants' survival. One truly feels the desperation of the few who bravely fight the Sentinels the same way one relates to Charles' hopelessness during the Vietnam war. Mystique's anger almost seems justified in her cause while Magneto's change in approach to Trask is a true revelation of his stubborn and apathetic nature. Wolverine's anguish frequently haunts him while his determination to save the future proves his heroism. Their possession of such human elements apart from their immense powers, makes some powerful characterization in an action movie that is rare to find. The call for righteousness through tolerance and peaceful co-existence by Charles is truly symbolic of his stand in the mutant- human relationship which will always be challenged by the society that finds it hard to accept that powerful mutants live among them. Especially when one of them lifts an entire stadium just to drop it over the White House with only his mind. <br/><br/><ul><li>8.639 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

","Marvel has given us the impression that not only do they have marvellous writers (forgive the pun), they also have magnificent playwrights - much as moviegoers may rate the Marvel series as ""superhero flicks"" and ""brainless entertainment"", the recent Marvel movies we are getting have plausible plots and convincing story lines. For fans who love the X-men chronology, this film will not disappoint as they played and expounded on the concept of ""changing the past to affect the future"" (I understand this is way before the ""Terminator"" or ""Back to the Future"" stories came out - so hats off to the Marvel team again). Wolverine fans should be pleased to see their hero's growth and development as he, the favoured one in the Marvel universe, again shouldered a burden seemingly beyond his bearing and managed to succeed. It is very enjoyable to see the ""young"" X-men and the Jim Croce soundtrack is very apt and well-matched to the scene."

That seemed a bit less heroic. <br/><br/>And really whats new in this movie, ""time travel"" .. already over done, ""giant robots"" .. common, we have seen Pacific Rim. And I don't think anyone noticed, the sentinels resembled the fire gushing iron giant in Thor. <br/><br/>Lets talk about action, wolverine without his metal claws, I could not take that. Why did Eric(Magneto) picked up the stadium, I don't have any idea. And the oldies(magneto and professor x) made the movie so boring. <br/><br/>Overall I had lots of expectation from the movie.

","You guys should really stop looking for the bad in every single superhero movie. This movie is by far THE BEST X-MEN MOVIE OF ALL TIME. Many of you guys may disagree. People who are comic book freaks will complain about Wolverine going back in time instead of Kitty like in the comics. Others will complain that the dialogue of the movie is terribly scripted and that there isn't enough action. Well, the only reasonable excuse is the first one the comic book freaks may have. The other ones are all completely false.<br/><br/>Many people come here and write bad reviews purposely because they complain about everything and try to find the bad in everything because they themselves aren't happy with their lives. These are known as ""Haters"" for those who don't already know. Do not trust these guys.<br/><br/>X-Men:Days of Future Past is indeed a wonderful movie. I highly suggest you see it if you have not already. Great story, wonderful acting, great fighting scenes, amazing heroes (both old and new), and of course the great and sexy Jennifer Lawrence at it again. My favorite addition were the scenes with Quicksilver. Too bad he couldn't have stuck around for the whole movie, but I sense he will be back in future X-Men movies. I hope they will be just as good or possibly better than this one.<br/><br/>Well, I hope you guys who haven't yet seen the movie will seriously consider seeing it. I saw it in 3D, which really isn't necessary but it put the movie in a whole new dimension! (Get it? Dimension?) The movie would have been just as amazing if I didn't see it in 3D. Well, stop reading this review and see the movie. NOW!"
"freemantle_uk","10","0","1","31 May 2014"," A Massive Blockbuster experience
","The 'Days of Future Past' storyline is one of the most famous and celebrated story arcs in the X-Men series, being adapted twice in cartoons. Now thanks to Bryan Singer, the storyline has been given the cinematic treatment and it is one of the best X-Men films so far.<br/><br/>In the future, giant robots known as Sentinels have taken over the world, holding humans in prison camps and hunting the remaining mutants. The Sentinels are able to absorb and counter mutant powers and are seemingly unstoppable. Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) has developed the power to send people's minds back in time to their younger bodies. The only hope for both humanity and mutant-kind is send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to 1973 to prevent the war from ever happening, being the only mutant to survive the process as a team of mutants hold protect the pair.<br/><br/>In 1973 Wolverine has to stop Raven Darkholme/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from assassinating the scientist Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), the creator of the Sentinels and a man who had been experimenting on mutants. His death would trigger the war and Mystique's capture would lead to a breakthrough that makes the Sentinels so dangerous. Wolverine has to reignite a disillusioned Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) who has been suppressing his powers and form a team of mutants to stop Mystique.<br/><br/>After 11 year absence from the director's chair Singer comes back to the series he has been synonymous with and he brings his all his strengths while also keeping the best aspects of X-Men: First Class. X-Men: Days of Future Past serves as sequel to the original trilogy, a sequel to X-Men: First Class and untangles the confusing mess that has become of the franchise's continuity. Singer keeps his darker, more serious approach, particularly for the bleak future to be created and adjusts to the blend of history and sci-fi that worked so well in X-Men: First Class. The previous films in the series are reference in some way, particular X2: X-Men United and X-Men: First Class and a few wider references for comic book fans to be excited about. X-Men Origins: Wolverine is noticeable with the absences of clips and ignores its events.<br/><br/>Singer's tone is a little lighter and humorous compared to his previous X-Men films when the events go into the 70s. Yet there is still emotional weight and character development that has been the strength of the best of the X-Men films as characters interact, clash and debate. One of the central themes is the clash of ideologues between Xavier and Magneto, debating how humanity will treat them and battling for Mystique's soul; made even more important because of their history in the previous film and Xavier being at his lowest ebb.<br/><br/>Simon Kinberg, the writer of X-Men: The Last Stand returns to the series, writing one of his best screenplays (considering his filmography, that was not hard). Kinberg and Singer also look at the old time travel theme of fate and destiny, asking if the war with Sentinels is inevitable, that the cause of history cannot be changed. This is similar to The Terminator series, particularly Terminator 2: Judgement, and people can easily make that connection: but it should be noted that the comic storyline started in 1981 and The Terminator was released in 1984. The future of X-Men: Days of Future Past shares some visual cues from the likes of The Terminator and The Matrix, the destroyed cities, the dark skies and the rounding up of people. x-men days of future past - wolverines orgasm face One of the most clever inventions of the film is the use of psychics powers to time travel, avoiding the paradox of someone meeting themselves and allows for two timelines going on symmetrically which brings in a ticking time bomb element to the story. The use of psychic powers also gives the characters from different time period to communicate.<br/><br/>The easy solution would have been Xavier could have read Wolverine's mind and he sees he was telling the truth. This is well explained by Xavier falling into a depression and suppressing his powers, giving him an arc of finding his faith and belief again.<br/><br/>As you would want and expect from a summer superhero film X-Men: Day of Future Past has strong action sequences and this film has some of the best special effect of the franchise. The best are the sequences in the future as the mutants have to fight against an impossible enemy and the use of the Sentinels having adaptation powers makes them an even more potent threat. A similar idea was used in the Wolverine and The X-Men cartoon. Singer brings in more slo-mo to his action sequences, particularly for Quicksilver (Even Peters) when he runs and slows down time.<br/><br/>X-Men: Days of Future Past has a large cast with younger and older versions of appearing and new characters being introduced. Our favourites of Wolverine, the older and younger versions of Xavier and Magneto, Mystique and Beast (Nicholas Hoult) are the characters who have the most screen time and perfectly played by their respective actors. The newer mutants played by actors like Omar Sy and Fan Bingbing get the short straw of screen time but they do have chance to shine in the action scenes. Dinklage is always a welcome presence on screen and Michael Fassbender shines once again as he shows off Magneto's crueler, more ruthless side. And Peters does what he is meant to be: he is a 'pain in the arse'.<br/><br/>X-Men: Days of Future Past combines the best aspects of the first two X-Men films and X-Men: First Class to give fans of the film series and the franchise as a whole, an excellent X-Men experience.<br/><br/>Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"

","Without a doubt this is the best X-Men movie ever made. The opening scene lets you know how awesome this movie is going to be. The action sequences are great. From what I remember, the action in the other films weren't all that entertaining in my opinion, but this one had it all. The Sentinals were brilliantly done and there powers are unmatched by any mutant.<br/><br/>As you know, this film is about Wolverine going back in time to change a specific event so that the sentinels are never made. Here we see the cast from ""X-Men: Origins"" along side Hugh Jackman. And the chemistry is there, it all works so well together. The main focus however, is on Jennifer Lawrence's character Mystique. She definitely gets a lot of screen time and well deserved at that.<br/><br/>My favorite part in the movie though was the character Quicksilver breaking into the Pentagon to break out Magneto. It was by far the coolest thing in the movie and the actor Evan Peters is great. I wish he had more screen time.

","X Men: First Class was a clever re-jigging by having new younger actors playing Magneto and Xavier and focusing on the origins of the X Men. <br/><br/>However like last year's Star Trek: Into Darkness, the second film gets away from a fresh page and goes back to its franchise history here we have the return of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen playing their older selves as past meets the future. It might be because both actors are not getting any younger that the producers decided to accelerate their appearance in the franchise.<br/><br/>The glue is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) as he travels into the past and prevent Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) killing scientist Trask (anagram of Stark!) By killing Trask (Peter Dinklage) the governments declare war on mutants and develop the robotic anti-mutant Sentinels who have almost wiped out the mutants in the future.<br/><br/>As Wolverine returns he see's McAvoy's Xavier, addicted to a serum, drunk and without his powers. Erik is in a maximum security prison but aided by Quicksilver, they free Erik and set about to Paris to stop Raven. The prison escape scene is marvellously done balancing wit and bravado.<br/><br/>The film is mainly set in the past as there is distrust and anger between Charles and Erik and whether Erik can be fully trusted. The set pieces are well executed with a balance of wit and pathos. Because of the focus on the newer actors there is little time devoted to the classic X Men actors as they are reduced to almost cameo status.<br/><br/>As a stand alone film I found the film enjoyable, its well paced the film hardly misses a beat. You can quibble about the time travel elements and the changing of the time strands. McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, Jackman all deliver in the acting stakes although surely I cannot be alone in thinking that the ageless Logan is actually looking old.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer the returning director of the first two X Men films brings a tight narrative focus and delivers a film with little flab but plenty of fab."

","Wow, look at that. It's the highest rating I've given a movie on this site so far! Honestly, it deserves that 8 out of 10. The plot was tightly written, the stakes were established early on (if you fail, there will be no more anything) and the future Sentinels with Mystique powers carry an appropriate amount of menace. I miss the old designs when they were huge like buildings, but practically speaking it makes a lot more sense for them to be small enough to go indoors. Master Mold is tragically absent from the movie, though. I think that could have been a good twist, especially since the opening sequence with Patrick Stewart narrating over it invoked some Terminator flashbacks. <br/><br/>The actor who plays Dr. Trask (since when was he a doctor of anything?) has very little to work with. Oh, god, that sounds like a joke. It's not, though! He doesn't have a lot of menace or motivation. Why does he want to kill all mutants? Simple Darwinism? Or is it greed because he wants to sell the Sentinels to the highest bidder? General Stryker in X2 had a clearly defined reason for what he was doing. And will somebody do something about that stupid hair?! Oh my god. I know that's just what the style was in the 70s but between that haircut and that porn 'stache I was expecting him to go full on Anchorman at any minute.<br/><br/>Moving on. So, apparently they had fully operational Sentinels in the 70s. Where were they when Magneto was ripping the Golden Gate Bridge out of its foundation and pointing it at Alcatraz?! Or when Magneto tried to mutate every possible world leader in New York City? Why wouldn't they immediately execute him when he was captured in the first movie if it's a matter of public record that he killed John F. Kennedy?<br/><br/>And Mystique, supposedly the one responsible for the entire future going to Hell, is apparently some kind of anti-hero now? An anti-hero that refuses to wear pants, by the way. At some point between this movie and First Class, she took over the team that Magneto was leading and got them all killed. Did she already give birth to Nightcrawler? Speaking of, she seems pretty spry in the first X-Men movies for someone without a healing ability that's roughly the same age as Xavier. Also, does her power also include super durable skin? Because she kicks Magneto right in the helmet and it doesn't bother her. What about walking on a hot sidewalk? Why does she replace Stryker and capture Wolverine? Is it in her contract that every movie has to end with her being somebody else and flashing her eyes at the audience? Why does she wait to be detected by Trask in the panic room before making her move? How was Magneto able to survive being shot through the jugular? Did Quicksilver ever find out Magneto was his father? Why was Toad in the movie and what was with those goggles? Why did they bring Quicksilver along only for him to leave the movie after a few minutes? Why don't they make a Flash movie with those effects?!<br/><br/>Ahem. Sorry. Despite all of these questions, I still really enjoyed the movie. Remember 8 out of 10? I just can't stop the questions. And why does Apocalypse look so wimpy!? Okay, last one."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","31 May 2014"," Lives Up To Its Hype & Delivers Everything It Promised.
","What has always set X-Men apart from other superhero-themed movies is that the conflicts present between mutants & humans in their stories very much reflect the predicaments most minority groups like LGBT community to anyone who doesn't fit in society's description of ""normal"" continue to find themselves in on a daily basis in real life.<br/><br/>After the critical & commercial success of X-Men: First Class, X-Men: Days of Future Past makes it way into cinema amid enormous hype but the great news is that it manages to live up to everything it promises. Days of Future Past connects the characters from the original X-Men Trilogy with their younger selves from X-Men: First Class in an epic battle where they need to change the past to save their future.<br/><br/>Ingeniously directed by Bryan Singer who returns to the X-Men franchise after being absent from it for over a decade yet he shows no loss in form whatsoever & ends up crafting his finest X-Men film with this instalment. And not only does he brilliantly continue the story introduced in X- Men: First Class but also brings the original X-Men Trilogy to a magnificent conclusion in this tale.<br/><br/>The screenplay is a gem in itself & thanks to Singer's excellent direction, the complex story isn't very difficult to follow, despite the plethora of characters present in it. Production design is no short of impressive, cinematography captures the two timelines in fine detailing, pacing is absolutely relentless as there isn't a single dull moment in the film, visual effects is seamlessly integrated & John Ottman's music adds a flavour of its own to the finished product.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, Days of Future Past features an ensemble cast in Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult, Halle Berry, Evan Peters, Peter Dinklage, Ellen Page & others. And although each one of them has done a fab job in their given roles, it's actually Evan Peters who ends up stealing the show in his brief appearance as Quicksilver.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the most ambitious X-Men film to date & although the stakes are high this time, it manages to work both as an explosive sequel to X- Men: First Class & a highly satisfying conclusion to the previous X-Men films. Featuring upgrades in all departments of filmmaking, this latest instalment is one of the most action- packed, relentlessly paced, emotionally gripping & rewarding sequels of its genre and comes highly recommended.<br/><br/>P.S. Don't go for it unless you've seen at least the original X-Men Trilogy & X-Men: First Class. And don't miss its after-credits scene which offers a sneak-peek at the next chapter, X-Men: Apocalypse, scheduled for release in Summer 2016.<br/><br/>Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com"

"OlieRendch","8","0","1","30 May 2014"," Entertaining enough, not quite the best.
","First it was a trilogy, then there was a prequel, and then a separate prequel, and then a spin-off from the trilogy and now we have... a reboot? X-Men: Days of Future Past is the 7th movie in the X-Men franchise, a franchise that's been on our screens for fourteen years; it's had some ups, it's had some downs, but it has certainly been a unique series. This year we get to see not only the original cast but also the refreshed younger cast. Of course the film involves time travel but this time it's quite different from mainstream sci-fi time travel, the movie doesn't dwell on it too much, if at all; the main focus is definitely the characters, I noticed two or three times that it showed more character interactions and dialogue than previous X-Men films, I mean of course there are the fight sequences and the big special effect scenes but the story definitely drove it a lot. Talking of the story I heard going in that this movie fixed every continuity error of the past films and was like a huge refresh; now after seeing it I was a bit taken back by how they did it; they do in a sense fix all the problems but in quite a big way, that's all I'll say not going into spoilers. One thing that did fascinate me with the movie was the look and feel, the parts set in the future, although not many, were for me the highlight, they were the most action-packed and the most emotional; the past has those things too but not as strong I don't think, although I did enjoy when they made it look like scenes were filmed on an old 70's camera. Obviously it was great seeing all the cast again and each one did a fantastic role, Hugh Jackman will always own Wolverine and although he took a bit more of a backseat in this one he still is entertaining to watch. In the end, I don't think it is the best X-Men film ever but it's an 8/10."
"Gordon-11","Null","0","2","30 May 2014"," A great blockbuster
","This film tells the story of the mutants saving themselves from extinction by travelling back to the past and change history.<br/><br/>What sets X-Men apart from the rest of the superhero blockbusters is that there are many superheroes in the film. It results in a feast of never ending special effects that never cease to wonder. I'm so impressed by the amazing visual effects, they are so real and so convincing. The scene where the survival of the mutants are critical in the cave, when the fraction of a second is stretched to minutes, is excellent. It conveys there urgency and heightens the thrill. The scene where a stadium is lifted up is also awe inspiring. There's so much spectacular scenes packed into the film, making it a great blockbuster."

","Marvel is rocking in 2014. First Captain America: The Winter Soldier hit the box office records now it is time for X men: Days of Future Past. All the credits for its success goes to its wonderful director Bryan Singer. When I first heard how many characters he is going to involve in this movie, I did not think that he will be able to justify all the characters. But after watching the movie I can say he did marvelous work. None of the characters feels like heavy load to watch. Every superhero character was doing superhero work not like other movies where they are in the movie just for appearance. Experience was thrilling from beginning to the end. Special effects were so real. Nothing to say about acting department. Jennifer Lawrence ,Michael Fassbender,Peter Dinklage and all the actors(Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen had less screen time compared to previously mentioned actors) have played their part perfectly but Jemes McAvoy and Hugh Jacman are amazing. Movie is best X men movie till date. This movie is good entertainment for hardcore comics fan as well as casual movie goer."

"Jerghal","9","0","2","30 May 2014"," The best one yet
","It's been a while I've seen a superhero movie in the cinema's because there are just to many of them and they were not always very interesting. For this ultimate X-men movie I made an exception: it had great trailers and it combines the excellent cast of X-men First Class with the veterans from the first X-men films. Time travel is used to alter the past to get a better future. As time travel is impossible it doesn't completely make sense plot wise (it never does). The movie mainly plays in the 70s so you could say it's more of a direct sequel to X-men First Class.There are also plenty of references to the other X-men films so fans of the series should get their money's worth. Unlike other superhero movies we don't get wall-to-wall destruction (although the action and VFX that are there are very well done and spectacular) but more focus plot development and characters. The only downside maybe is the implausible quest of getting along with the humans despite their urge to destroy the mutants in every film and the sometimes repetitive speeches that go with it. That aside I have to say it might be the best X-men film yet. There is also a small teaser of things to come after the credits."

","I have seen this movie twice and I will see it a third time. The second time was even better! <br/><br/>The thing I liked about this movie was that it had every element of an action movie all driven buy a very complex yet compelling plot. I love things blowing up but when you have a movie that is driven buy a compelling plot it makes for a attractive movie.<br/><br/>X-menDOFP was an elemental movie in that it carried almost every elements from different genres meshed into a superhero context. You had the sci-fi aspect looking at the mechanics of alternate timelines and realities; you had the action-packed sequences to engage the audience; you had the themes of absolutism and extremism versus passivity and idealism; political dimensions of minority versus majority, civil liberties versus security. All of this was not just elements acting on its own but they were very much connected to the characterization that in turn was driven buy a very complex plot that had me at the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>This movie does not follow the trend of city destructions and constant explosions, rather it focus on action that will only move the plot. Its action sequence are very intense and compelling.<br/><br/>I can only say that you need to experience this movie! Great movie. 10/10"
"richcarter1962","9","0","2","29 May 2014"," If You've Given Up on the X-Men Franchise, DON'T
","If you are like me, and a lot of people are, you probably thought that X-Men The Last Stand sucked, with good reason, it did. Wolverine was a little better, but still rated a ""Meh, not that bad"". First Class was a step in the right direction, but, Days of Future Past brings us back to what we loved about the X-Men in the first movie. I had read a LOT of the reviews and the build up was tremendous, so I went in with super high expectations, which is usually a recipe for disaster, however this time I got everything I had bargained for.<br/><br/>The bulk of the movie is essentially set in the past so you are dealing primarily with a younger set of actors, with exception of Hugh Jackman. Jackman and Lawrence dominate most of the screen time, which was just fine with me, in that, I love Jackman as Wolverine, and Jennifer Lawrence is my favorite young actress(for movies like Silver Linings Playbook, and American Hustle; Hunger Games, not so much).<br/><br/>As you would expect the CGI was tremendous, but as in most good sci-fi movies, the CGI was NOT the center of this movie. The characters were what drives this movie. The writing and directing are just sooooo much better than any of the other sequels, that's what really makes this a fun and absorbing movie to watch. If you like the X-Men I promise you, you will like this movie, if you've been turned off by the last few sequels, do yourself a favor and go see this one, it is well worth it.<br/><br/>P.S. Peter Dinklage is everywhere these days and the more I see of him the more I like him,(yes I'm a Game of Thrones junkie). He's the evil villain here in DOFP, and he's excellent."
"mharnenz11","10","0","2","29 May 2014"," Singer's Vision Is A Cut Above The Rest
","Make no mistake...THIS is a Bryan Singer X-Men movie. It has heart, suspense, and a further reaching purpose which sets it apart from much of Marvel's arsenal of films. <br/><br/>The cast is truly electrifying and they fill their characters to the brim without overflowing. It was amazing to see Lawrence as Mystique who is much more developed in this than in any other X-Men movie. Aside Mystique are the groundbreaking performances of McAvoy and Fassbender who once again continue their charming yin and yang roles as Xavier and Magneto. And let us not forget Jackman as Wolverine. He arguably slipped up with The Wolverine but make no mistake: he is back to his cigar puffing self!<br/><br/>As a fan of the franchise it is nice to most of the original cast, even if they do only slip onto the screen for a minute or two. The writers really do an excellent job in maintaining order in a script which calls for two separate time lines and they perfectly executed balancing out enough of the past and present events to keep the suspense going and the punches flying.<br/><br/>A breathtaking movie which reaches a broader audience than most might think. If you appreciate cinema and if you loved the first X-Men then GO SEE THIS FILM!"

","Let me clear it X-Men First Class is still the best X-Men movie. I Had great expectations after the trailers and the initial reviews on IMDb of Days of future past but sadly I was deeply disappointed. Even the 3D was average to say the least. Seems like Bryan Singer doesn't suit the X-men series. I think its the poor execution of the screenplay by Bryan that proved to be the biggest let down of the movie. Only one act I liked the most is when Quicksilver helps in rescuing Magneto from the Pentagon It stands out rest is just so not Big when you consider a Franchise which is 8 movies old. The whole story was handled in haphazard way. Peter Dinklage was wasted. When you build up about Sentinels being a threat to mutants you need to show it to us in a big way not in 5 mins. The fight with Sentinels was as if Mutants already knew they are going to lose the battle and Only hope of survival is the success of Logan. They had a build up to the climax but the climax just didn't happen or you can say it wasn't big enough to be noticed. Hope they don't do this to X-Men Apocalypse. My Rating 7/10."
"TheSquiss","7","0","2","29 May 2014"," Much-needed shot in the arm. The X-men live. And die. And live again.
","In 1994 David Carson linked two eras of the Starship Enterprise with his Star Trek: Generations. It wasn't entirely successful but was far from being the biggest turkey in the cinematic outing of the franchise. With X-Men: Days of Future Past, Bryan Singer returns to the series (as director) with a more audacious link between eras and with markedly greater success.<br/><br/>X-Men: Days of Future Past is a convoluted but thoroughly enjoyable excuse to throw two Magnetos, two Professor Xs and a host of our favourite mutants into a time travel romp with evil doings, minor destruction, moderate violence, naked pecs and blue breasts. And what's not to like about that? It's a hit, it'll be a success and there's clearly a market for more.<br/><br/>Waaaaay back in 1973, money-grabbing, almost villainous Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) develops a blueprint for an army of sentinels to hunt down the pesky mutants, aided by the DNA of Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Fifty years later, the sentinels are not only wiping out the mutants but also the humans who aided them and time is running perilously short for the remaining X-Men. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) opt to send Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to persuade the young Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) to prevent Raven from inadvertently initiating the demise of mutantkind <br/><br/>There's lots on screen that doesn't quite make sense, there's an awful lot of action packed into the 131 minute running time and there'll be plenty of viewers who emerge scratching their heads, having had a great evening but not really following all of it.<br/><br/>But no matter. X-Men: Days of Future Past is great fun that packs in the cameos, ups the ante and opens the door for a whole new chapter of X-Men movies. The Marvel world has always been in good hands with Singer at the helm and his reappearance has strengthened it just as the attraction was beginning to wane.<br/><br/>Where X-Men: Days of Future Past rejuvenates the series is that it remembers not just to thrill and entertain, but to have fun being fun. The introduction of Quicksilver (Evan Peters) is a most welcome injection of adrenalin and the scene in the Pentagon basement is an absolute joy. Singer takes his time, slows the pace down and enjoys constructing the sequence as though choreographing a ballet with the mother of all punch-lines. It is thrilling, funny and a superb change of pace that will have you pressing the rewind button when you watch it again at home.<br/><br/>Yes, X-Men: Days of Future Past is a little cluttered and there is the sense that drastic steps needed to be taken to put the franchise back on track and refill the Marvel bank account, but far from being desperate, it works. It's fun and it's too long to wait for 2016's X-Men: Apocalypse.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

"justserag","9","0","2","28 May 2014"," The Best X-Men Movie
","A screen extravaganza that we long waited for.X-Men: Days of Future Past, adapted from the Uncanny X-Men storyline of the same name, is about the mutants being in a dystopian future where they are wiped out by the Sentinels which are huge robots that are superior to them and have the ability to replicate their powers.They have to send Wolverine back in time (a la Terminator) to prevent Mystique from an act that caused the creation of the Sentinels and thus creating an alternate universe in which the last 50 years in their lives are altered (a la Star Trek). The film is superior to every other feature in the franchise on every aspect.Bryan Singer is back with a style of originality and creativity.The script by Simon Kinberg is very well paced and structured.The production design by John Myhre and set decoration by Louise Mingenbach are great.And John Ottman's score refreshes our memory with the old themes of the original trilogy and providing new terrific ones such as Hope (Xavier's theme). The ensemble cast of the film was a great eye candy especially for the devoted fans,and easter eggs were thrown by the characters at every chance possible (Quicksilver remarking that his mother knew someone who could do stuff like Erik).Hugh Jackman as Logan, arguably the main protagonist of the franchise, gave yet another down-to-the-bone characterization of the Wolverine.It was exciting to see him carrying such a life-threatening responsibility on his own. James McAvoys made a brilliant work as young Xavier with a performance drastically different from First Class, this alcoholic hairy desperate Professor X is unquestionably a new treat to the viewers.Fassbender is the same old Fassbender as Erik but I really believe that his role was a little bit overshadowed in this one, but he did an excellent job overall.Jennifer Lawrence excelled as Raven in the evolution of her character to emerge as Mystique , but the heavily CGI-based make-up didn't quite feel convincing as Rebecca Romijn's authentic one in the original trilogy.Nicholas Hoult was the perfect sidekick as Hank McCoy but didn't do much as Beast. But it was Peter Dinklage as Trask and Evan Peters as Quicksilver who stole the show.Dinklage, though an inferior villain to the mutants, was a very great threat as the cunning arrogant inventor, and Quicksilver's slowmo sequence accompanied by Jim Croce's Time in a Bottle is the most memorable part of the film.Josh Helman was amazing as young Stryker and though his role was comparably small, he did it with grace.It was great to see back Ian Mckellen and Patrick Stewart (who gave his best Professor X performance) and you'd wish to see more of them.Also in addition to bringing back Shawn Ashmore as the now mature mutant leader Iceman, Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde who is the connecting gear of the plot and Daniel Cudmore as Colossus.And also introducing interesting new characters such as Blink portrayed by Bingbing Fan and Omar Sy as Bishop.But there were a few letdowns: Cutting down most of Storm's role due to Halle Berry's pregnancy (she has only one line of dialog and 30 seconds of action), cutting Anna Paquin's role down to a mere cameo of Rogue with Bobby in the very end, and I was personally disappointed that Lucas Till had only a small cameo as Havok, I wished he could have a more significant role.We were compensated with surprising awesome cameos of Famke Janssen as Jean and James Marsden as Scott that even topped Jackman's cameo in First Class, and also a blink-and-you-miss-it moment of Kelsey Grammar as Beast. The action sequences were well choreographed, and edited perfectly to seamlessly flow with each other.You can hardly feel distracted when jumping from the future to the past, and it's a huge suspense when you could see how an action in the 70s could affect directly the protagonists in 2024. Overall, the film is nearly flawless and hits all the right points.Hold on till after the credits for a pacing scene to the next installment.By far the best X-Men film, rating 9/10"

"EmmaDinkins","10","0","3","27 May 2014"," A Chix Chat on Film review: Humans vs Mutants vs Sentinels
","The title of this film and the trailer made it quite clear that the plot would deal with time travel. With time travel there's always the risk of some paradox, but my thoughts were that there was a need for some type of event or portal to an alternate universe or something phenomenal to reclaim characters that had been lost to in prior X-Men installments. Days of Future Past tells a very creative story surrounding the Sentinels, which we only previously got a glimpse of in a school training exercise. The design of the newest X-Men nemesis in this film was spectacular; the special effects were sublime in conveying how impervious to most any attack these massive creations were. I recall from the animated series on television how all the key characters battled against the Sentinels, which would have been basically impossible with so many of the X-Men having met their demise in The Last Stand. There were a few new mutants introduced in this new tale, Adam Cantu from televisions The Following as Sunspot, Booboo Stewart best known from The Twilight Saga is all grown up as Warpath and most notably Evan Peters as Quicksilver. Quicksilver was an integral part of getting things moving, no pun intended, his character was the most entertaining because he was both quirky and uncontrollable. He was not one of the characters that recalled as front and center from the animated series, but he certainly made a lasting impression and will hopefully be back. Aside from the new mutants the other very interesting aspect of the story was the state of existence the players were in from where we left them at the end of First Class. This was a young Professor that I had never known. Rather than go on about all the things that made this a great film. I will suffice it to say that it was the best in the series so far. It was creative and masterfully told. I loved it and am looking forward to the next story featuring Apocalypse, who as I recall was a most difficult foe. BTW if you haven't seen this film yet, be sure to stick around after the final scenes for an after credits treat."

","""And if you tolerate this, your children will be next."" - Nicky Wire<br/><br/>Homosapiens are bigoted jerks in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"". Fearful of difference, and so seeking to annihilate all with genetic mutations, mankind initiates a plan to capture and kill all deviants. Assisting in this goal is the Sentinel Project, a fleet of robots designed (ironically) by a physically handicapped dwarf named Trask (Peter Dinklage). Fighting for peace, understanding and tolerance is Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Fighting for mutant dominance is Magneto (Ian McKellan), a mutant whose hate has been forged by both the Holocaust and years of anti-mutie sentiment. ""Days of Future Past"" was directed by Bryan Singer, a homosexual.<br/><br/>""Future Past"" opens in the near future. On a dark, claustrophobic, fake-looking sound-stage, a rag-tag group of mutants battle robotic Sentinels. Those looking for the lumbering, gargoyle-faced Sentinels of the X-men comics will be disappointed. Singer's art departments have created quick-moving, liquid-metal beasts. No longer slow, monstrous and towering over whole buildings, these new Sentinels are mostly derivative, unimaginative and small. Singer has replaced monstrous Easter Island statues with high-tech ballerinas.<br/><br/>""Future Past"" then branches off into two story lines. In one, set in the early 1970s, our heroes attempt to prevent Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from unwittingly sparking a war between humans and mutants. In another, set in the 21st century (and reminiscent of the overwhelming Sentinal attack in ""Matrix 3""), a band of mutants attempt to hold back a horde of Sentinels. These future war sequences are mostly disappointing. Where the X-men comics portrayed this future as an expansive, rubble strewn battlefield (reminiscent of the war-torn future of James Cameron's ""Terminator"" movies), Bryan Singer gives us small, cheap sets and kung-fu robots.<br/><br/>Singer's 1970s storyline plays better. Here we meet Quicksilver (Evan Peters), who's granted a playful action sequence which almost rivals Singer at his past best. More poor set design follows (an unconvincing Vietnam, train-station, Pentagon etc), and yet another Magneto prison break, before Singer climaxes with an audacious set-piece in which Magneto cleverly cages the White House. This sequence expertly blends spectacle and emotion - Singer conveys well Mystique's bitterness, her self-hatred, as well as Xavier's overflowing love and compassion - but ultimately boils down to a very old cliché: a character grappling with whether or not to pull a trigger.<br/><br/>The ""X-Men"" franchise has been one of the most poorly planned franchises in cinema history. No episode flows coherently into the next, each episode feels stand-alone and hastily cobbled together, and each film spends all its time setting up things that promise to happen but never do. The franchise has very little continuity, very little carries over from one film to the next, and those characters who do heavily reappear (Wolverine, Magneto, Xavier) tend to merely go through the same motions. There is no progression. Ever. ""Days of Future Past"" epitomises this ""refusal to move"" by literally resetting and negating whole chunks of its own franchise.<br/><br/>Such poor planning is annoying, because few superhero brands have as much potential (and real world relevance) as the ""X-Men"". A great writer could do wonderful things with Magneto and Xavier, the former a freedom fighter turned fascist (and whose villainy is understandable, complex and at times even justified), the latter a tortured idealist, but Singer's writers are mostly hacks. The moral gravity that these two characters broach is never properly exploited. Put Xavier and Magneto over a chessboard and the sparks will fly naturally, sans CGI, but Singer's writers are rarely up to the task.<br/><br/>Some have complained that ""Future Past"" messily jumps from past to future. But a bigger problem is the scatter-shot nature of the entire filmed franchise. The series perhaps deserved a writer who slowly, meticulously and incrementally sketches the ""X-Men"" mythology, starting from the birth of the first mutant, to the formation of Xavier's school for outcasts, to perhaps an entire episode focusing on man on mutant genocide/persecution. Then, and only then, after he has experienced the second Holocaust of his lifetime, work towards Magneto's meltdown, his bloody victory over humanity, and finally mankind's last ditch effort to create Sentinels. Too linear? Too traditional? Maybe, but it might have upped the stakes. Currently, nothing matters in the ""X-men"" franchise. Ironically, the franchise's scatter-shot, never-ending style perfectly echoes the nature of comic-books, in which characters are continuously and flippantly rebooted, resurrected and re-imagined.<br/><br/>""Future Past"" co-stars James McAvoy, who is excellent, and Michael Fassbender, who isn't given much to do. Bryan Singer's direction is fine, but can't touch his work on ""X1"" and ""X2"". Bizarrely for a film set in the early 1970s, ""Future Past"" features Tasers, complex robots and advanced genetic manipulation.<br/><br/>7/10 – Worth two viewings. See Menno Meyjes' ""Max""."
"stinadianne","9","0","1","22 May 2014"," The best one so far!
","Since their arrival on the comic book scene in 1963, The X-Men have been always been Marvel's most famous ragtag crew. From comics to cartoons and movies, these characters and their world have continued to not only exist, but grow and expand. The newest film from director Bryan Singer, X-men: Days Of Future Past, takes the world created in the first X-Men films and skillfully blends them together in a time-bending, fun and action packed adventure.<br/><br/>In 2023, mutants are being brutally hunted and killed by ruthless robot beings called Sentinels. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his on- again, off-again best friend Magneto (Ian McKellen) enlist the angry but lovable brute Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to travel back in time. His mission is to try and reverse a deed done in 1973 by the shape shifter Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) whose actions lead to the creation of the Sentinels. Once Wolverine is back in time he must bring together the estranged younger Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and Xavier (James McAvoy) so they find Mystique and stop this future from happening.<br/><br/>Singer, who directed both X-Men and X2: X-Men United, delivers the best X-Men film so far. The task to bring all these story lines together from every movie in the X-Men arsenal seems impossible and improbable. Singers success is impressive as one would expect nothing but an incoherent mess full of missed plot cues and poorly written character choices. He even gives importance and the right amount of attention to the characters who aren't considered part of the main line-up. Mutants such as Blink, Warpath, Bishop, Sunspot and Havok are all given short, yet important moments to shine that work well within the story.<br/><br/>Jackman, Fassbender and McAvoy form a fun and angsty team in 1973. The three actors use their amazing talents to fill their roles to the brim, bringing honesty, sadness, and humor to each of their characters. Lawrence (Winter's Bone, American Hustle) once again shines as Mystique,who has matured since X-Men: First Class. She gives Mystique aimlessness while showing her pure passion for her self appointed mission to protect mutants from evil humans like Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), who have no sympathy for mutants and only see them as a threat to humankind.<br/><br/>A stand out in the film is Even Peters as a young Quicksilver. Quicksilver has the power to move very fast and one of the most entertaining and memorable sequences in the film is when you are shown what he can truly do. This sequence will be remembered not only for this movie, but in years to come. The use of special effects might ensure Quicksilver of The X-Men will be more beloved than the soon-to-be-met Quicksilver in Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>X-Men: Days of Future Past is not only the perfect summer blockbuster, it is also the perfect superhero film. Mixing the familiarity for the characters with the time bending storyline you are given a fun ride with a social message of acceptance of people everywhere, which is what X-Men is always and should always be about: equality for all. It's an important message that needs to be heard and it always helps to use sexy mutants and lovable classic anti-heroes to tell it."

","With the days of political correctness upon us, it sometimes is difficult to wade through and find the real gems on the big screen. I feel like a big Toys""R""Us kid, but I unabashedly thoroughly enjoyed this movie with one of my Grand-sons. I didn't give the movie a full 10 stars, but at the same time I can't think of any part of the film that was flawed. It is entertainment, action, drama, sci-fi in one movie, with virtually every character playing a part made just for them. It did not rely on The Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to carry the movie's plot, but instead was a carefully threaded story of who and what the X-Men are, thus the name ""Days of Future Past. And more than anything else, the movie was not about political correctness, and even did a subtle push- back against the current politically correct crowd. I Didn't Think It Could Get Any Better! But I was certainly wrong. This movie is a winner, and its success even has Hugh Jackman reconsidering his retirement of the role he has become synonymous with, the role of The Wolverine. Suffice it say, I am truly anticipating the next X-Men sequel. How in the world could they top this one, remains to be seen."

","Wow.. this movie was amazing. It was deep and mature instead of just an action-packed CGI fest. Nothing wrong with the Avengers either.. but not every comic book movie needs to be dumbed down for the low sloping foreheads who just want non-stop senseless action with no depth. <br/><br/>I think it was ballsy to sacrifice lots of action for some actual story and substance in a summer movie like this. I wish more comic book movies would go in this direction. Everyone has seen all the big CGI tricks now. We get it. We are over it. Now give us something deep. Gives us a good story. Give us something to think about. Give us a reason to watch the movie again. This film does this.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch if you are prepared to listen and think.

The story line is OK. If you've seen the other X-Men movies, it is very similar in style. Somewhat slow pace then it picks up. Nothing unusual or exciting except short battle clips with the Sentinels. Not enough juice to knock people out. I'm sure DC Comics has gotten Marvel to think harder and come up with a better challenge. So far DC Comics has gotten a new fan; I anticipate a killer Batman vs. Superman smash in 2016.

","I think its got mostly back the right tone what X-men should be. I loved X1 and X2. And Im one of those rare people who actually liked x3, apart from using characters too rushed. And I also loved Wolverine Origins, even though it might have used a bunch of characters differently as most people use to it, or for just the stake of them being there. But I love the tone of that movie, the strength Logan and her girlfriend shows no matter what people do to them, they will try to be the better man. And for me that's what x-men in the core always been. A bunch of characters fighting a impossible war, and beside there own personal problems and the challenges they face with or without a team they always pull together there self and chose the right path. I hated first class with its lazy writing, james bond atmosphere, and stupid characters like acid spiting butterfly girl. The Wolverine was a decent jet flat try. In my eyes at least. <br/><br/>the story of this movie starts right at the middle which first might confuse people who never seen the original comic, or cartoon adaptation of Days of Future past. But to the film credit its eventually answers the most important questions in time, so even non x-men fans will understand the plot. It has a dark, sorta hopeless tone, well balanced with the characters not giving up no matter how dark the situation is. There are many fun moments when its feels the makers did check what a character can do and had fun with the tools (mutant powers) in there hands. Like i was not sure i would like quicksilver, but his one of the highlight of the movie. And there's a scene with him which reminded me of the x2 Nightcrawler scene where he attacks the president. What I mean for me that scene in x2 was a breath taker the passing, the music, the way it shows what the character could do was just amazing. And a completely different situation but with the same feeling shows what Quicksilver can do. I also liked that they put a side the too goofy ability characters like the previously mentioned acid spiting butterfly girl. The relationship between young Charles and Eric also become more realistic, i felt first class was to slop building up there friendship and quickly rushed to the point when the split without every really linking them. And I liked that they where not linked, and young Charles actually disliked Eric a lot. And the scene where Young Charles and Old Charles speaks makes it more understandable what ties them together, without really chewing in your mount. Charles with his ability understand others way better than they understand there self, so he really just want to help everyone. So in away they not really friends they know each other for a long time, and has a history, but looking back on all the movies. Its always Charles who wants to help Eric, and Eric if he plays along usually have his own agenda. But the Charles- Eric-Raven part was still weak, tough was not really over pushed. <br/><br/>But to the reason why i did not gived it 10 stars. While it explains most the plot quite well, there are things which you would really like to know but it rubs it under the rug. Like why Charles looks the same after his body was blown to peaces. <br/><br/>the other and lot bigger part when x-men started it was ""in the not to far future"" and it had some hints like the Poland scene that mutants where around before, but it kept it small and not history altering. First Class and Days of Future Past strongly goes agents this, altering historical events. Which cuts down from the sci-fi and leans more towards to fantasy. And i don't think that's good thing. Days of Future Past did many parts way better than first class did so it was not really annoying, but still would prefer if the future movies would try to capture more the first x1 and x2 tone of more sci-fi than fantasy tale of we know thats not how history happened.<br/><br/>Also my opinion Young Hank and Raven where good and enjoyable. Young Erik and Charles where decent but they are far from Patrick Steward and Ian McKellen, which is from a point understandable since the later two have way more experience. But maybe it would be a nice idea like i don't know... make James McAvoy look like Charles Xavier, with the wheel chair and bold head. And not run around like a stoned hippie. A) How many other wheel chaired, bold superhero there is? B) I actually don't need a b.<br/><br/>I prefer the cast of the first trilogy way better. But if we need to go first class direction. Make Xavier look like Xavier, recruit a young Scott Summers, Jean Grey and Ororo Monroe beside Hank. And If Wolverine is a no no, put maybe Gambit on the team. Now there's a first class i would be trilled about.<br/><br/>About Apocalypse I hope he wont be a one movie huge treat which gets resolved in 120 minutes. Apocalypse always where a huge deal, most of the time X-men was not able to beat him just delay his plans. So Im hoping we will get at least a trilogy with him, and also a story which dose not relay heavily on altering the past. <br/><br/>Overall even with its slight slips X-men days of Future Past dose way many things right. there for its a fun movie to watch regardless if your a fan or not. Though if you have not seen any of the previous movies and don't know a thing about x-men its probably not the first movie you should start with."

","Eleven years since Bryan Singer made an X-Men film, he is back with a force, and delivers his best X-Men film yet. While this is an amazing film, and a top notch film for the genre, I still hold the previous X-Men film, First Class, above this film. After all the issues previous films have had in this series, for example X-Men 3, Origins Wolverine, and The Wolverine, to connect everything back nicely like Singer did was an amazing task, and he succeeded in doing so.<br/><br/>As I just mentioned, this film, like the first two X-Men films, is directed by the great Bryan Singer. Lets be honest. When Singer left things got messy, no doubt about it. The only highlight from this series once he left was X-Men: First Class, which Singer has a story credit for. Singer brings back his great style back to the franchise. His action scenes are amazing, and with First Class being light on the action, this film is a giant step up in that department.<br/><br/>The film was written by Simon Kinberg, Jane Goldman, Simon Kinberg, and Matthew Vaughn(writer and director of X-Men: First Class). This writing team in addition to Bryan Singer righted a lot of holes that the films start to spring up once Singer left the series after X2. Now while some of the holes are fixed up nicely most are just patched over with the time travel element of the story. A story like this really needs the viewer to be detailed in what has happened in the lead up to this film. So watching all of the previous films is almost a must to see this film. As I as watching this film at the theater, a few people were asking their friends during the film what was going on because there is a lot of jumping back and forth from the previous films. So please go back and make sure you have seen all the previous X-Men films before you have watched this movie. Another great element of this film has to be the addition of Quicksilver, played by Evan Peters. Sure the character doesn't get much screen time, but with the time this character gets he dominates the film. You should leave the theater remembering that character.<br/><br/>This film was composed by John Ottman. He previously scored X2 for Bryan Singer as well as recent films like Jack the Giant Slayer(also directed by Singer), and Non Stop. While he hasn't been involved in this genre for a great many years, its like he never left. The score in this film was truly amazing. One of the best superhero scores in a long time. Up there with the great Hans Zimmer and his superhero genre scores.<br/><br/>Overall this is without a doubt a must see superhero film. In a year when superhero films are dominating the big screen, X-Men: Days of Future Past might be the best of them all. The hype you have been hearing is all true. Personally though I do still hold X-Men: First Class above this film. While the action in that film was light, the story and the characters were written a little bit better, and as I mention above, this film here does require some heavy viewing of the previous X-Men films. No matter how you rank the films though, there is no doubt that Days of Future Past is one of the better X-Men films.<br/><br/>9/10"
"YasheshJ","8","0","2","25 May 2014"," A sensational film and a 'would-be' progenitor to many more forthcoming, smashing X-Men blockbusters!
","FIRST CLASS was 'the' perfect film and many wondered how Singer would topple it. He actually doesn't, but what he made is the best possible follow up film that could have been made.Singer had his task cut out; not only he had to make a good sequel to FIRST CLASS but also work his way around previous incongruous films in the franchise, without discrediting any. <br/><br/>The 3rd X-Men film was the biggest hurdle; makers simply did not foresee more than a dozen films, and franchise still going full steam ahead. Singer successfully cleared away all mess without impacting any of the origins stories or key highlights of characters. Wolverine still gets the adamantium, Magneto continues the evil/vigilante route, and back-bone of X-Men gets fortified again with Scott and Jean back.<br/><br/>It is one of those few films that were better made on-screen than originally written—SIN CITY and, up to an extent, V FOR VENDETTA to name a few others. Sending Wolverine back into past instead of Kitty was a masterstroke. Time travel conundrum is handled beautifully—no surprises though, after all Cameron was involved consultatively. Quicksilver's connection to Magneto neatly slipped in the story too (The Marvel-Fox standoff means we will see a different Quiclsilver in Avengers: Age of Ultron!). <br/><br/>First Class remains the best because it was an intelligent and genius film, yet an all-out mainstream entertainer. On the other hand, Days of Future Past is a dazzling display of genius direction and ingenious screenplay—brings the X-Men universe back on track.<br/><br/>Some Awe-inspiring Scenes and Components<br/><br/>Quicksilver saving the hides of Xavier, Magneto, and Wolverine in Pentagon.<br/><br/>Future Sentinels: astonishing creativity and impeccable design; clearly a lot of thought behind these. Hats off to the SFX too! (More than Mystique's, I felt Rogue's powers were the key, though.) <br/><br/>Desolate Future: gives the exact feel of a despondent, gloomy world; even comicbook pages didn't capture it this good!<br/><br/>Whitehouse breach and being palisaded within the 'structure' (too awesome to be spoiled!) Magneto uprooted.<br/><br/>Associations to previous films; at times humorous (best ever pay back 'F--- off' :) and metal detector to name a few), at times elucidating (mentions of Azazel, Banshee, etc.) <br/><br/>Overall, a brilliant film that opens up the X-Men franchise to possibilities anew. Some might find it little lacking in action, however, considering what all it had to deal with and what it is building up to, it was perfect dose of action.<br/><br/>Original Timeline: Haywire!<br/><br/>Timeline Now:<br/><br/>FIRST CLASS (1960s around Cuban missile crisis) <br/><br/>DAYS OF FUTURE PAST (1970s around JFK assassination | Future: 2020s) <br/><br/>X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (1840s-1980s | Wolverine's memory loss)<br/><br/>X-MEN 1, 2, 3 [2000s | story/incidences conveniently merged into a collapsed timeline; school is formed but Multiverse accounts for Xavier being unacquainted with Wolverine, the events of LAST STAND (Phoenix Saga), deaths of certain characters, etc.]<br/><br/>THE WOLVERINE (2010s)<br/><br/>Upcoming Films:<br/><br/>X-Men: Apocalypse (? | plot undecided)<br/><br/>Wolverine 3 (sequel to The Wolverine)<br/><br/>Drawbacks: Hardly any. One minor disappointment was Warpath—his look (facial features and getup) did qualify but stature was very smallish; the guy is 7 feet+ giant in X-Men universe <br/><br/>Post Credits: Age of Apocalypse is nigh!

"xcvb_2003","9","0","1","25 May 2014"," Best X-men movie to date.
","Bryan Singer is back and at the top of his game. After directing two great Xmen movies (X-men 1 and X-men 2), he was out of the game. But after 11 years, he came back and delivered THE BEST X-MEN MOVIE TO DATE. He even managed to undo the damage done by X-men 3 in a glorious way. The future of the franchise looks brighter than ever. <br/><br/>Days of future past takes place well into the future where mutants are being driven to extinction by extremely powerful machines. To avert this, they send back Logan (Wolverine) back in time to stop this from ever happening. That's the main premise and although it is nothing new, Singer delivered it with perfection and I love time travel stories anyway. And Because of this story, a lot of problems have been fixed but I can't go into details because that will be spoilerish. :p<br/><br/>This movie is like a gift to X-men movie franchise fans. There are so many references to all the movies that came before it. Since majority of the movie takes place in the past, cast of X-men: First class is also back and seeing both the older versions and younger versions of famous characters from previous parts in one movie just has its own feeling. Think of it like The Avengers of X-men franchise. You know all the main characters, their back stories etc. They don't waste time introducing them again, they just role with it. And all the actors were at the top of their game. Hugh jackman, James Mcavoy, Michael Fassbender etc all were awesome. <br/><br/>This movie has a very helplessness tone in it and you really do feel the need of hope for these characters, especially the future ones because those Sentinels (machines) are scary powerful and are depicted perfectly. It has some great FEELS scenes too. I was so overwhelmed in some scenes. IT is not all dark and feelsy though, there is some good amount of humor and light areas thrown in too, timed greatly. Few movies blend so many different tones in such a great way. <br/><br/>Great action sequences and pretty good CGI. Soundtrack is good. It was so awesome to hear X-men 2 main theme song again during the openings. Would have been great if they somehow used First class soundtrack too in some areas. <br/><br/>Overall, if you loved X-men movies or even remotely liked them, this is A TREAT for you. One of the best comic book movie, easily the best X-men movie and best movie of the year so far for me. Just one advice before watching it though, do yourself a favor and rewatch all the previous parts before watching this to refresh your memory (Maybe you can skip X- men: Origins), you'll thank me. :p And there is an after credit scene so be sure to wait for that.<br/><br/>9/10"
"oscarxp25","9","0","1","25 May 2014"," It's a beautiful Day!
","What makes the majority of the ""X-men"" franchise work, except for the terrible ""Origins"", and not so much with the mediocre ""The Last Stand"", is that it clings to the theme about those who are different, how they react to the world, and how the world reacts to them. In ""X-men: Days of Future Past"" is takes the theme again for the seventh time and makes it seem fresh. This is a film that is not only a hell of a good time to watch but also contains some great commentary.<br/><br/>We open up with a war going on. Both new and old X-men are battling it out with machines called, The Sentinels, who are overpowering our beloved and misunderstood heroes. It is quite frightening to see these God like mutants, that we come to love, being easily taken down. These machines adapt to each individual power that a mutant throws at them. They are truly frightening and unforgiving with the punishment they put down on the X-men. In a desperate attempt to change the current events, Charles Xavier suggests that he uses time travel to go back in time and prevent the assassination of Bolivar Trask (""Game of Thrones"" Peter Dinklage, having a great time). Trask is responsible for the creation of the machines that are wiping out and imprisioning all the mutants around the world. On the other side of the trigger of the gun that will kill him is Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Since Charles is too weak, Wolverine (the ever reliable Hugh Jackman) volunteers to go back.<br/><br/>Wolverine's challenge is not just stopping the assassination but also convincing the old Charles of the tragic future. Charles is not the calm and wise man that he is in the future. As played by James McAvoy, he is full of regret and anger. Though he is able to walk, through the use of a serum that calms his telepathic abilities, he has given up on life and the cause he started in ""First Class"". McAvoy gets so much to play with, thanks to a wonderful script by Simon Kinberg, and he once again makes Charles a great, but flawed, character. Ian McKellan's Magneto also gets a worthy performance out of his younger self. Michael Fassbender provides Erik, Magento's real name, with the same conflicting sense of self we have come to know of the character. He is so ""magnetic"" that you can't help to actually understand him and feel for his side of the cause. While this is being sold as the ultimate X-men movie, those two characters along with Beast, Wolverine, and Mystique are the main focus of the story. Nicholas Hoult is a great beast. His nerdy and nervous side is as convincing as when he rages then turns furry and blue Academy Awards winner Lawrence is still as vicious and sexy as ever as the shape shifter. Jackman, getting up there in age seems to get more ripped and angry as ever. Unlike ""Origins"" where he was just a ball of rage, he sells the urgency of saving his kind quite well. The newcomer here is a rebellious mutant teenager named Quicksilver. ""American Horror Story"" star Evan Peters speaks as quickly as his mutant character runs. The character's power has a whole scene dedicated to it. It is one of the highlights of the film. Peters not only captures the coolness of the character in that scene, but the playful rebellious nature any teenager would have if they had that power.<br/><br/>Though the time travel aspect of the story is the main gem of the story, it is the philosophy of the results of both scenarios where the movie finds its dramatic footing. The film takes a nice turn when the younger Magneto starts to question the mission. Mystique also has hesitations about what she has set out to do. Lawrence perfectly plays the ever going battle of both Charles's and Erik's philosophies doing battle in her mind. Every facial expression or expression of dialogue is captured with ease. What do you expect from an actress of her caliber being able to play in a comic book world? She is going to add so much to it, and she does.<br/><br/>When Bryan Singer came back, the director of the first two, there was worry that he may mess up the tone that Vaughn captured in ""First Class"". It was a film that respected what Singer had set up in the originals but established its own feel and attitude. Singer pays back Vaughn by remaining true to the playful nature that this thing can be sometimes. The film is just so cool sometimes that you expect it to be wearing a leather coat and sunglasses. Singer also creates some of the most exciting action scenes in the franchise. The ending battle has Magneto stealing an entire baseball field. Yeah, you read that right. That is not to say the other action sequences aren't worthy. The action is as big as it is fun.<br/><br/>Singer has taken the attitude of ""First Class"" and combined it with his grand scale ambitions to create a summer blockbuster that is something more. It is smart, funny, cool, and one hell of a ride."
"RNMorton","9","0","1","25 May 2014"," A Really Outstanding Movie
","There is no question that time travel can be a tricky thing, but it's used here very successfully to link the old and new X-Men characters to great effect. I have been on my soapbox for the last several years about how high tech has replaced good stories (as in computer gaming). Most of the movies now seem to be four or five high tech scenes that don't look very real involving undeveloped characters with clumsy, padded bridges from one CGI scene to the next (see, e.g., Godzilla, the Transformer movies, the latest Percy Jackson and much of what else is out there). Au contrare here, where the acting is just spectacular (my kudos to the younger Xavier and Magneto, as well as Lawrence, Jackman and others), and the story makes sense and does just fine on its own. In this situation the special effects - and they are good - are just the icing on the cake. And isn't Hugh Jackman a welcome sci-fi version of Clint Eastwood? The actors shine, the plot makes sense, when it all falls together in these Marvel masterpieces it's just a wonderful thing. Highly recommended."

","Days of Future Past takes us straight into the distant and dark future of 2023, where the X- Men world where most of the mutants have been wiped out by giant robots known as the Sentinels, while most of the humans also oppressed by them. With the very few mutants left we find that Xaiver, Magneto, Wolverine, Kitty Pryde, Storm and Ice Man are still alive along with new on screen mutants in Blink, Warpath, Sunspot and Bishop and they hatch a plan to send Wolverine's consciousness back to the past in order to stop an assassination that triggers the events of the Sentinels creation and prevent the war from ever happening. If ever there was a comic film that you could call more ambitious than Marvel's assembling of The Avengers it is X-Men: Days of Future Past. Not only are you bringing back the original band and also having them share playtime with the new band members, you also have to contain that within the time travel plot aspect without losing some of the general film audience that aren't as heavily invested as die hard X-Men fans. The question becomes a case of does the film live up to the hype? For my view I can honestly say absolutely.<br/><br/>It's been 14 years since Singer started the X-Men franchise (time certainly flies by) and has come back to take the reins of a world he knows so well and manages to make this complicated time travel plot and huge assemble of characters, old and younger versions of characters in particular, seem so effortless.<br/><br/>Kitty transports Wolverine back 50 years to 1973 and tries to get Charles and Erik together to help him stop the assassination to prevent the war, which is easier said than done. We find Charles Xavier in a dark gloomy rut after the events of X-Men: First Class and we also discover that Erik is held in a prison underneath the Pentagon. Here Wolverine turns to the help of a young Peter Maximoff aka Quicksilver to help him out and for anyone that was worried about Quicksilver mainly because of his appearance in the photos/magazine covers released in the past don't worry, the character himself is great in this film. This also may be the most definitive version of Wolverine we've had on the big screen, a man no longer as angry (though will throw down hard when needs be) as he was in previous films, here he's on mission mode to restore the faith in Charles Xavier who is at his lowest point and considering how Xavier helped Wolverine in the previous films, it's nice to witness the role reversal in this film. Also this is quite possibly the funniest Wolverine has ever been with his deadpan wit exchanges with Xaiver, Erik and Hank. Considering how iconic the actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are in the roles of Professor X and Magneto, it's astounding how great and subtle James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are in the same roles and you easily buy them as the characters. I didn't think much of Lawrence's part of Mystique in First Class but she's handed a pretty integral role in the timeline of this film and has become the character as we see Raven/Mystique's motives fleshed out more (phrasing) as the film goes on. One of the biggest yet minor issues in relation to that is that the villain, trigger focus point of these events, Peter Dinklage's Trask, is underused and unclear as to his motivation for creating the Sentinels to take out the mutants to protect mankind in the first place, so that was disappointing.<br/><br/>For a film set in the comic world of mutants and a film with particular set action pieces, this is the most emotion I've seen riding in a comic book film before. McAvoy is great as the lost and essentially his heart is no longer in the cause he fought for in First Class Xavier, Fassbender plays Magneto with menacing cool, willing to do whatever it takes to protect the mutant race. Also revel in the set pieces such as the future opening of the remaining mutants with the Sentinels, the prison breakout and the finale at the White House (even with President Nixon).<br/><br/>Singer does well to balance out the characters in a just over two hour screen time and get their time in the spotlight to shine, none more so than Quicksilver in the past and Blink in the future. My childhood self wishes that there was more Bishop, but again minor. Now it's a question of where will the next film go to? Will we time travel again or has the torch now definitely passed on?<br/><br/>X-Men: Days of Future Past has a great assembled cast, great storyline and overall it's definitely the best X-Men film we've had since X-Men 2, now it's just deciding which of the two I liked more. Also the end credits shape things nicely for the next X-Men film and get the die-hard fans going crazy."
"praveenraghav1989","9","0","2","25 May 2014"," Best X-Men movie to have come out till date and also raises the standard of the X-Men Franchise
","Director Bryan Singer returns back to the X-Men Franchise after a gap of 9 years and is blazing guns to make sure that his recent outing X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) comes out well as this movie happens to be 7th movie in the series and third for Bryan Singer as director. Matthew Vaughn who had directed X-Men: First Class (2011) joins along with Singer as one of the writers for this movie.<br/><br/>The movie begins in the dystopian future in the year 2023 where we are shown the last remaining X-Men fighting hard against the robots known as Sentinels, built for the solitary purpose of mutant obliteration. At one point, the X-Men who are alive regroup and devise a plan to stop the Mutant Annihilation before it ever begins and finally Professor X/Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto/Erik Lensherr (Sir Ian Mc Kellen) decide to send Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman) back in to the past to change the itinerary of events so that Mutants are left for good rather than dead. From this point, the movie travels back into the 1970s where the rest of the story builds and happens. Furthermore telling of the story would be like giving out the spoilers or even like revealing the complete plot.<br/><br/>This movie's main strength lies neither in the Mind Blowing Visual Effects nor in the Cutting Edge Action Sequences as how most of the superhero movies rely upon; instead Bryan Singer has done a brilliant work in executing this movie with more attention provided in the areas of character design and depiction, storytelling and screenplay. The director deserves a mention and applause for the above since this movie has an ensemble cast of many X-Men characters sharing screen space in various situations and the makers have to be careful that not even a single moment in the movie gets overcrowded and goes haywire.<br/><br/>The movie's casting is overwhelming since you have Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Michael Fassbender, Charles McAvoy, Ellen Page, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Jeniffer Lawrence and Nicholas Hault sharing screen space throughout the movie , but they make their appearance suitably for the scenes where they are needed the most. One of the movie's most entertaining factors is the Short Cameo done by Quicksilver/Peter Maximoff (Evan Peters) which is sure to leave the viewers enthralled till the movie's end and also to mention the thrilling climax sequence where Magneto/Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) yet again proves that why he is considered and feared as one of the most powerful mutants.<br/><br/>This movie acts as a sequel to X-Men: First Class (2011) and X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and also all other X-Men movies are linked with this movie so one has to have watched all movies in the X-Men franchise or at least have an idea of their main plot and happenings to get this movie completely at the end and how things have worked out. This movie keeps you thinking and puzzled at certain phases of the movie and you even think to have a re-watch of all X-Men movies again to make sure that you are following the movie in its way though you might have watched them all several times.<br/><br/>To conclude, this is the Best X-Men movie to have come out till date and also raises the standard of the X-Men Franchise and also for the upcoming movie in the series. This movie will stand out and receive acclaims for it making, presentation and most of all for brilliantly using the concept of time travel mechanism."
"GoUSN","8","0","2","24 May 2014"," Excellent entertainment but . . .
","I came to this film without seeing prior Xmen films. I was a novice. But because the story lines are relatively straightforward, the plot was easy to follow. There were just a handful of instances where knowledge of the franchise would have added context, but these were few and minor.<br/><br/>I put this film on par with those I cannot bear to leave, even if for a brief restroom visit. Other films in this category: Avatar, The King's Speech, The Artist, the very first Lord of the Rings film. . .<br/><br/>Here was a spellbinding tale - with top-tier performances, fascinating plot turns, and marvelously inventive uses of the source material, with new touches that were equally superb.<br/><br/>The two minor negative points? The mutant who sent Wolverine's consciousness back in time said during the rushed planning scene that she could send someone back maybe a day or a week, but that back to 1973 was a tall order. No plot turn relied on this point.<br/><br/>Second, the culminating events in the film relied on climaxes being reached simultaneously but in two different times. What are the odds of that occurring: 1 in a billion? These may be minor nits, so I gave it an 8."
"Troy_Campbell","8","0","2","24 May 2014"," A smart and exciting blockbuster.
","Returning to the X-series he made critically and commercially popular with X-Men and X2, director Bryan Singer is at his most ambitious with this sequel to both X-Men 3: The Last Stand and X-Men: First Class. Negotiating time-travel, following multiple timelines concurrently, merging two ensemble casts from essentially separate X-franchises, and tight roping the line between popcorn thrills and metaphorically thought-provoking themes, Singer has to balance all of these elements to produce a cohesive and exhilarating motion picture. Despite the occasional plot contrivance or continuity-blurring choice, scribe Simon Kinberg largely nails a narratively logical and thematically rich story, offering satisfying follow-ups to existing plot threads whilst breaking new ground and presenting fresh characters. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) – who is rapidly approaching oversaturation – is the mutant at the centre of the whole shebang thanks to his unique ability to travel from the future to the past, with the younger incarnations of Magento (Michael Fassbender), Professor X (James McAvoy), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Beast (Nicholas Hoult) splitting the lion's share of screen time between them. The ""veteran"" cast members (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Halle Berry et al) are thankfully not short-changed and Peter Dinklage is commanding as villain Boliver Trask, however the undeniable standout is Evan Peters as the hilariously cheeky Quicksilver. From a visual standpoint the action set pieces are meticulously constructed, expertly executed (with flawless CGI) and carefully edited; all combining to maximise sheer awesomeness. The dual finale seeing the mutant exterminating Sentinels closing in on both the future and past lead characters is impressive, however the sequence where Wolvie, Quicksilver and Prof X break Magneto out of a heavily fortified prison underneath the Pentagon is one of the most exciting and enjoyable set pieces of the year. It's not perfect and doesn't surpass either X2 or First Class (despite coming close), but Days of Future Past is a smart, exuberant and highly fulfilling blockbuster."
"t-hf","8","0","2","24 May 2014"," equal parts goofy and epic
","So X Men:Days of Future Past is finally here and does it deliver?....you bet it does!! With Bryan Singer back in the director's chair where he belongs what could possibly go wrong? From the opening credits (with the original X2 theme music I might add) to the very last uttered word - this movie keeps up the pace briskly with exhilarating set pieces and some great suspense, leaving just enough time for some very gentle, poignant scenes and cracking humour. It's great to see the original cast back and it's nice to see an x-men movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. The film is goofy when it wants to be and serious only when needed. In short, it is everything you've been wanting from an x-men movie for the past decade. However, I will admit that you may find some parts a bit disappointing. For instance, You may not see as much of your favourite characters as you wanted to. This is predominantly Wolverine, Prof. X and Magneto's movie. If you love those characters like we all do then you'll love the movie, but if you wanted to see your favourite characters return, you may just have to put up with a short cameo at best. However, needless to say, the movie makes up for this and I must say that the franchise is back with a bang. I think we can expect great things in the future now the X-Men are back on track and on behalf of all of us - human and mutant alike - I say welcome back Mr. Singer, good to have you back and great job!"
"LiamBlackburn","8","0","2","24 May 2014"," Humans and mutants share the most important thing
","...and that.. is hope.....I seriously almost started crying it was so beautiful that climactic part where X is going into the future to communicate with his consciousness. That worked on so many levels. Sometimes you look in the mirror and you say wow what the hell is that looking back at me. The mutant archetype is very powerful as it sits inside our sub- consciousnesses and waits to be activated at the most important times. It is so difficult for us humans to fully acknowledge our inner-mutant and that is what this movie is all about. Facing our own destructiveness as a species. The best scene though by far is where the super-speedy guy does that wall walk 360 thing in the kitchen after they break out magneto. Holy hell....that was seriously breathtaking in 3d. I can't say that this quite measured up to Godzilla as the best of this summer but it was a seriously great movie. Bonus points to the mystique chick and the sexy body paint."
"Special-K88","Null","0","1","24 May 2014"," a story of loss, hope and survival that effectively redeems its predecessors
","Ambitious, exciting, exceedingly well-crafted chapter of the X-Men saga begins in a dystopian future where both mutant and human populations have been ravaged by extermination robots known as Sentinels. Desperate to restore the world to what it once was, the remaining mutants unite and transport Wolverine back to 1973 to prevent an event that will stop the war before it ever begins. Once there, he's given the difficult task of trying to persuade an embittered Charles Xavier (McAvoy) and a maniacal Erik Lehnsherr (Fassbender) to work together to avoid future annihilation. Those who may have grown weary of all the excessive characters and subplots in the previous films will be pleasantly surprised as this tense, epic-scale saga provides multiple narratives skillfully woven together, breathless action scenes, superior special effects, an ensemble cast, a witty sense of humor, and elements of tragedy balanced by just as many genuine displays of heroism. Singer's use of past and future tense is both clever and confusing, but it's still compelling and guaranteed to pack a wallop for series fans. ***½"
"Irie212","9","0","3","24 May 2014"," An instant classic in the genre
","This movie is close to flawless. X-Men: DoFP has substance as well as virtuoso technique. And once again, as happens so often in the ""superhero"" genre, the bad guys-- the ruthless and powerful humans who destroy what they cannot understand or control-- are Americans, often the government itself. That alone merits my admiration every time, from Iron Man ironically fighting against his own iron weapons, to José Padilha's Robo-Cop, where a scientist (Gary Oldman) has to try to turn Alex Murphy into a mindless killing machine because the military-industrial complex (Omnicorp in this case) funds his research. It reflects reality all too well, sugar-coated though it is in fantasy.<br/><br/>Casting Peter Dinklage as Trask, the mutant-hating scientist, takes full advantage of that actor's skills and his stature. Dwarfism is usually caused by a genetic disorder, and to quote Wikipedia, ""A condition caused by mutations in one or more genes is called a genetic disorder."" So he is self-hating, but when asked if he really hates mutants, he says no-- he admires them. He has to; in a way, he's one of them. You don't find that kind of complex insight in many 3-D action pictures.<br/><br/>Trask's warning to the Senate about underestimating the enemy refers to mutants, but he's speaking in 1973, as we are evacuating Vietnam and entering the Paris Peace Talks (scenes of both are included). We lost that war and he doesn't know this, but we do: Iraq, Iran, and global guerrilla warfare (a.k.a. terrorism) are in our future. Americans -- especially Americans -- cannot be reminded often enough that underestimating an enemy is a deadly and arrogant mistake.<br/><br/>It is not an original idea, but using time-travel to start new time-lines is a game-changer, and well adapted here. The whole franchise is re-booted now, and everything that happened in earlier films was just an alternate time-line-- meta-universe stuff, much like J. J. Abrams' Star Trek reboot. <br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing: the scene where Quicksilver (Evan Peters) is shown at normal speed while everything else appears frozen already stands as one of the best scenes ever conceived in science fiction, and its execution is breathtaking-- a thrilling mixture of comedy, chaos and explication.<br/><br/>There's more, of course. The humor is fresh, and it's both visual and verbal. The writer, Simon Kinberg, does such a beautiful job with the script-- it smart, brisk, and witty-- that I think we should forgive him for THIS MEANS WAR. There are underwhelming performances, particularly Shawn Ashmore as Iceman, but a few low batteries in this powerhouse array hardly matter. A mere quibble. Because, if we leave aside the inevitable time-travel paradoxes and don't ask too much about how Kitty Pryde's quantum tunneling ability allows her to send a disembodied mind through space-time, we have a new classic in the Science Fiction genre, worthy of multiple viewings. It was a stroke of genius in 2011 to cast two screen-commanding talents, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, in a movie series that already had the Sirs Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, and that genius is back on display here."

"burakberkesu","9","0","2","23 May 2014"," X-Men Origins: Mystique
","Here we have another X-Men movie with Wolverine in the centre. Oops, I misspelled Mystique! Do not get me wrong; I love Mystique. I adore her at an extreme level and always liked how essential of a role she had in the trilogy, yet I do not think that she is THIS important of a character.<br/><br/>I also like Jennifer Lawrence and her performance as Katniss Everdeen a lot, but I have never agreed on how she is the right choice for this part. She is a pretty woman, but not drop-dead gorgeous. Mystique is a femme fatale; she is sexy as hell and deadly and frightening all at the same time. Romijn has that spirit, Lawrence does not.<br/><br/>Another reason why Mystique becomes the protagonist of the film is the misuse of other characters. Wolverine is supposed to be the main character here, considering that Shadowcat's own story was changed to make Wolverine get the spotlight once again, but he is like Wasp amongst the Avengers: useless. He has no important role except for the ""physically-strong-thingy"" and is lame from the first second of the film till the last one.<br/><br/>You thought less important X-Men like Kitty Pryde or Colossus had unsatisfactory screen time in the previous instalments? Watch this one. Kitty gets wounded in spite of her ability, Colossus can be seen being smashed by a Sentinel time to time, Bishop looks like he is in a Hallowe'en costume, Sunspot is a fusion of Human Torch and Sunfire, Warpath acts like a regular warrior except for his ""Elf eyes"" scene, and Blink and Blink only can be defined splendid.<br/><br/>Let's not forget the best one of course: Quicksilver! Despite my prejudice, he was perhaps the best X-Men character ever to be on the white screen. ""The scene"" was just incontrovertibly spectacular. If Avengers: Age of Ultron nails it half as much, that will be a great movie.<br/><br/>Now stop taking me seriously and go see how horrible Beast's make-up still is and how awful Mystique's has become. Do not miss Ms. Darkholme's Matrix fighting style and try taking a tequila shot every single time Stewart, McKellen or Berry has a scene. You will not leave the theatre drunk, believe me.<br/><br/>PS: Wait for the scene at the end of the credits for the next X-Men villain. Do not bother to waste your time if your knowledge of superheroes end with the movies."
"bamaisrael","9","0","2","23 May 2014"," More than just a blockbuster or reboot
","DoFP is a perfect course correction for the X-men franchise, and Bryan Singer pulls it off perfectly. The story is well developed and never slow. The action sequences are amazing in 3-D and don't feel forced or overwhelming. The thing that really struck me was the opening for FOX to continue with either cast. After Last Stand it looked like the studio had painted itself into a corner and was forced into earlier timelines unwillingly. But looking back, it's almost as if the earlier timelines were just an aside, so that the characters are better developed when it came around to this movie. I keep reading about this being a summer blockbuster...and it is. But the story has depth and heart, which keeps it true to the comics. Walking out of the theater I was ready to buy a ticket to the next X-men film. This is not one you want to pass up."

","I found the movie to be a wonderful spin on a classic story. It was a pleasure to see such a blockbuster cast set aside their ego for a well built story and not demand more screen time. There will always be complaints about why one member was or wasn't in the story but the team they assembled worked will together. I also enjoy how the franchise tries to create a historical reference by tying the stories to real events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis in the First Class movie. As a whole the story nicely tied the franchise together and presented some intriguing team possibilities for the next installment in the franchise. I can only hope that ""Age of Apocalypse"" is as good with Singer at the Helm. Can't wait to take the family to go see it when I go again :)"

","Like others have said, I think everyone is struggling to find something wrong with the film. <br/><br/>With the future being changed, it also changed the past. Jean Grey returns, and she never killed Scott, was killed by Wolverine. Any of the damage Brett Ratner caused in Last Stand seems to have gone after this.<br/><br/>Quicksilver was hilarious (but slightly annoying), and Blink's teleport portals were really cool, and I particularly liked the slingshot of Colossus in a Portal style.<br/><br/>I was disappointed not to see more than the one scene (showed most of it in the end credit scene of Captain America: The Winter Soldier) of Havoc (Alex Summers). I don't know why Anna Pacquin was in the credits, she had a 5 second non-speaking role at the very end of the film, mainly just to show she was alive. Also some people in the cinema were asking how Xavier was alive. It is explained in the comics, and we know it happens in the film because of the end credit scene in Last Stand, but it is never explained in this film, which I was surprised by. Plus, I did notice when James McAvoy's Xavier was looking into Wolverine's mind, it would swap from 1 finger on Wolverine's temple to two between shots. Happened multiple times. But again, this is all nitpicking.<br/><br/>Absolutely brilliant film, really enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>What we are left questioning? What the hell was that end credit scene? Where will they go from here? Something that bothered me from the trailer: if Xavier transferred himself into his brain dead twin brother's body, why was he still in a wheelchair if his brother never got shot on the beach like he did?"

","X-Men: Days of Future Past. Well, that certainly helped to wipe away my last poor movie experience (the awful Godzilla)! Great to have Bryan Singer back behind at the helm (after the abomination that was the Singer-less X-Men: The Last Stand). This movie attempts to streamline and tie together the two parallel X-Men franchises (original and the excellent First Class), as well as the two Wolverine movies (the first of which is best left forgotten) - and it does a superb job!<br/><br/>The story was engaging and fairly complex with some shocking moments. The f/x were top notch and almost seamless. Timeline conflicts between books and films aside, the characters were treated very well - with Blink being one of my favorites.<br/><br/>It might be blasphemous to say, but as much as I love Ian McKellan - Michael Fassbender may have surpassed as his performance as Magneto was fantastic, improving on his work in X-Men: First Class.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence owns Mystique now. Yeah, Rebecca Romijn might have the better body, but Jennifer blows her away in the acting department - adding so much more depth to the character.<br/><br/>McAvoy, like Fassbender, improved on his character from First Class - and who doesn't need more Peter Dinklage?? He scores one of the best scenes in the movie when he speaks before Congress.<br/><br/>And Sentinels?? Not what I expected, but totally awesome!<br/><br/>Yes, there is some alterations to the time-line after this (and some minor conflicts that have yet to be resolved), as everyone expected, and I'm x-cited to see the next installment as we go back and ""fill in"" the new arc. I also can't wait for the Blu-Ray release as I'm sure there will be extra scenes aplenty, and there are so many easter eggs scattered throughout it's going to take a careful still-frame viewing to catch them all.<br/><br/>As always -- MAKE SURE YOU STAY UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS!!!!"
