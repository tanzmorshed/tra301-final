","Needs to be seen to be believed; in one word: perfection. Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain't gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.<br/><br/>I'll never get tired of watching Goodfellas; the entertainment value of this film is just amazing. It doesn't happen very often that every person involved in the process of making a film is at the peak of his/her game. And rarely do art and entertainment come together the way they did here. Storytelling with impeccable pacing, this is what it's like when a master composer conducts his masterpiece. All hail the king; the most versatile and talented filmmaker of his generation: Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>My vote: 10 out of 10<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

","""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.<br/><br/>Gangsters are all around us. Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. ""Goodfellas""--based on true events--explores the lives of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the Mafia at a young age and continues his ""career"" throughout the film.<br/><br/>As he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mob boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino); and he is friends with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a calm, steady gangster; and Tommy (Joe Pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems. <br/><br/>Eventually Henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to drug abuse and paranoia, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a tour de force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as Jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in ""Goodfellas,"" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. ""What do you want, f&*^&?"" the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely Paul Thomas Anderson in ""Boogie Nights"") and there's a reason: it's great stuff. He totally deserved to receive Best Director in 1990, but of course he didn't. (Rumor has it the Academy frowns on Scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work. Oh boo hoo, get over it.)<br/><br/>The movie is based on the true-crime memoirs of the real-life Henry Hill, whose novel with Nicholas Pileggi -- ""Wiseguys"" -- was adapted into a screenplay by Pileggi and Scorsese. The book itself was fantastic and insightful; the screenplay is even better. The dialogue is incredible.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""Goodfellas"" has to be one of the best films I've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen. It's an offer you can't refuse!"
"mhasheider","10","313","455","6 November 2004"," One word: priceless
","If there was one word that I could use to describe Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"": it'd be priceless.<br/><br/>A surreal and deeply fascinating take on life of Henry Hill who was involved in the Mob for three decades and his rise throughout the time span (and Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"").<br/><br/>There isn't a single moment in the movie where it doesn't miss a beat, you could only tell by the atmosphere of the time period and it seems so real.<br/><br/>The performances in this film simply make it even more memorable and how the characters are portrayed here especially by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Paul Sorvino are believable and easy to understand that they were a family, very close and tightly knit to the core. Also, how director Martin Scorsese lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit."
"AlsExGal","10","30","38","18 November 2009"," The best mobster film ever made
","After you see this movie, all other mobster movies you see or ever have seen will seem like garbage. They and their cast of characters will all appear cartoonish in comparison. Of course, this is a movie about the mafia from the working man/gangster point of view, where ""The Godfather"" was a mafia movie filmed from the viewpoint of the executive suite, so there really is no valid comparison there. ""Goodfellas"" really does seem ahead of its time when you realize that the only artistic work about the mafia that compares to it in quality is the HBO series ""The Sopranos"", which debuted nine years after this movie was made.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" tells the real-life story of mobster Henry Hill, and it is largely true, although there are individual scenes that are out of sequence and others that were added for dramatic effect, such as Karen Hill flushing the cocaine down the toilet during the drug bust. Also, Tommy, the character that Joe Pesci played and the part for which he won an Oscar, was actually a composite of two separate gangsters. Other details are omitted completely, probably because they would have spun the movie off in too many different directions. For example, crime boss ""Big Paulie"" actually was having an affair with Henry Hill's wife, Karen. When Tommy tried to rape her and Paulie found out, that was when he alerted the Gambinos to the fact that Tommy had killed their missing crew member, ""made man"" Billy Batts, nine years earlier. This is the true reason that it took so long for Tommy to be killed over that incident. Thus, masterful direction of the story by Martin Scorsese in what was probably his finest film is why the audience has a more cohesive view of the mobsters portrayed in this movie than if we had been told every last detail.<br/><br/>What really makes this movie great is all of the personal details that enable you to see these mobsters living a largely suburban life, concerned about kids' birthday parties and getting the sauce just right for dinner, and all the while completely immersed in a completely amoral lifestyle in which murder and bribes solve everything- a lifestyle to which they would never voluntarily choose an alternative."
"OriginalMovieBuff21","10","303","465","11 April 2005"," The greatest mob film still today
","Amazing is the one and only word to say for this film. I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song ""Layla,"" put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+"
"thomashamps","9","170","263","13 September 2000"," A true classic
","This is the gangster film at its finest. Scorsese is on top form as are Pesci and De Niro. Liotta has never bettered the performance he gives here. The film starts as it means to go on - violent, full of profanity, fast paced and very stylish. The story follows Liotta's character from boy to man as he climbs his way up through the ranks of organised crime. We see all the highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very undesirable characters along the way. It's a film full of memorable scenes whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same time. This is what all movies should be like. It draws you in and won't let you out of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. If ever the word 'masterpiece' was meant to be used, it was for this film."
"SmilingRon","10","183","287","5 September 2005"," A masterpiece exposing misguided loyalties and greed
","Scorcese & Pileggi's masterpiece on the life of Henry Hill as a Brooklyn NY mob wise-guy. <br/><br/>As much as the true events of Henry's life have more than likely been dramatised and glamourised to a certain extent, the essence of this film IMO is that it is still a brilliantly damning portrayal of the characters and lifestyle of mobsters.<br/><br/>The sham of the mafiosi is exposed - preaching loyalty, respect & principles - but when it comes down to it they are just two-bit criminals that'll stab each other in the back for money or power over others. Each of them has an inflated sense of self-worth and stature that comes with being a ""wiseguy"", breeding with it paranoia that others are not giving them the respect they deserve.<br/><br/>An example is De Niro's portrayal of Jimmy Conway. His outward persona is that of a calm and reasonable nature. But really he is a paranoid killer who at the drop of a hat would kill even his closest associates for money. I use associates rather than friends, as their relationships are of tolerance rather than kinship. Distrust, hate and jealousy through the forced smiles. <br/><br/>Interesting that given this, certain people envy their life-style and would have loved to have been a wiseguy. I personally couldn't think of anything worse that being tied for life with having to keep the likes of Tommy company, but whatever rocks your boat. Some people have actually paid to see The Dukes of Hazzard film, so I shouldn't be surprised."
"tfrizzell","Null","252","426","21 July 2000"," The Definitive Film of the 1990s
","""GoodFellas"" may be the most important film of the 1990s in the fact that its incredible success led to some of the other great movies of the decade. Films like ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Crying Game"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Fargo"", and ""L.A. Confidential"" would have likely never been made as well as they were without the influence of Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"".  The film is an intense study of a Mafia family over a 30-year stretch.  Ray Liotta plays the half-Irish, half-Sicilian kid from Brooklyn whose only dream is to be a gangster.  Although Liotta's story is at the heart of ""GoodFellas"", it is the supporting cast that is the film's calling card.  Robert DeNiro gives one of his greatest performances, Paul Sorvino is quietly effective, and Lorraine Bracco (in an Oscar-nominated role) does the best work of her career.  However, it is Joe Pesci (in his well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) who steals every scene as the one who does the ""dirty work"".  This is probably the definitive film in a decade that produced many film-noir styled classics.  5 stars out of 5."
"Infofreak","Null","143","251","17 March 2003"," Simply a masterpiece. Scorsese's last truly great movie (to date).
","'Goodfellas' is a masterpiece, pure and simple. While not my favourite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies. The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it's all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the ""stars"". (Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks cool!). 'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!"
"shanfloyd","8","123","224","29 March 2005"," A classic mobster film.
","This is one hell of a film about the mobsters, based on a true story and coming from one of the great directors of all time. This is about Henry Hill, the narrator of the story, an Irish simple person who gets involved with the Mafia at a very young age and continues his life through it. There is no major plot in this film, just isolated incidents one of which was the turning point of Hill's life. Scorsese, as brilliant as he ever was, shows violence, sex and drugs etc in his own trademark style. And his actors helps him to make this film one of the classics.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro is not present in much of the film, nor his acting leaves too much impression. The three actors who really did their best job here are Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco. I hate to say that most youngsters today don't know too much about Liotta or how talented he was. I asked my younger brother about him and he said, ""The man who did the voice on GTA: Vice City?"". This is partly because Liotta did not get too many big roles after that, especially in recent years. But here he is just brilliant as Hill. It's Pesci's one of the best too. Playing a mad mobster with dark sense of humor wasn't his usual type. And Lorraine Bracco becomes the perfect lead female in such type of films.<br/><br/>The film's got smart screenplay and excellent cinematography. And I don't know how many times Scorsese will be denied his Academy recognition. I hate to see a lifetime achievement award as his first Oscar. But things are going like that."
"baumer","10","79","141","16 September 1999"," Scorsese's best
","Goodfellas makes you feel like you are watching guys that you know or knew. To this day, I have a friend that still talks like Jimmy Two Times. He always says things like ""Nice Nice"" and that was just a background piece in Goodfellas. But that is the point, all that is background is just as important as the main players and locales. It all paints us a perfect picture of what mob life must be like. And with all due kudos to The Godfather, but there is no other film that has ever made mob life look so real and feel so tangible the way Goodfellas does.<br/><br/>To say that Joe Pesci is the best part of this film would be to discredit the rest of the cast, but at the same time, you have to mention him in some way. His portrayal of Tommy is haunting. Here is a man that is so insecure and wants to be the top dog, the made man so bad that he can't decipher between what is a joke and what is disrespect towards him. Of course the scene in question is when he shoots a common boy for telling Tommy to screw himself after he shot him in the leg. You would think the guy has a right to let off a little steam and vent, but Tommy is always looking for the diss. He is always looking to find some hidden gesture from someone that is putting him down. Even at the beginning when he is getting on Henri in the now famous "" You're a funny guy "" scene. He is kidding with Henri but deep down inside he is angry with him, you can see it and feel it. Joe Pesci gave the performance of his career and he richly deserved to win best supporting actor that year.<br/><br/>The story and script by Pileggi is sheer inside brilliance. You can feel the inside observations that no one can have except for a guy that spent his whole life on the inside. They ring so true and they get into your blood. From scenes like the fat guy running around delivering messages to the other mob guys because he doesn't like to use the phone to the scene when Henri, Jimmy and Tommy have Billy Bats in the trunk but they stop off at Tommy's moms house for a late night dinner of pasta and such. They also have to borrow a sharp knife to finish off the guy in the trunk, but to his mom they have to cut off the hoof of a dear that hit the car. And the scene where Tommy does kill the young kid for joking with him and then Jimmy gets mad at him, not for killing the guy but because he doesn't want to dig a hole tonight. There are so many tiny observations in Goodfellas that give it the authenticity it has. And it is a film that stays with you for years to come. I think this is Scorcese's best film and although I understand and accept why the academy awarded Dances With Wolves the accolades it did, if this film would have swept the Oscars that year, no one would have been surprised. It is a landmark film and I think it is one of the best films ever made. And again, taking no credit away from Coppolla's Godfather epics, but this gets inside the mafia on a deeper level. It goes one step beyond what Coppolla gave us, and for that Goodfellas should be remembered as the best film about gangsters ever made."
"Guitarboi615","10","178","342","12 April 2005"," Wanna Be a Wise guy?
","One of the best Mafia movies I've ever seen. This and The Godfather are movies I must recommend if you like gangsters, wise guys, etc. This movie is actually based on a true story. The real Henry Hill, who is the main star of this movie, actually said it was at least 90% true. He than said it was probably 98% accurate. This movie expresses a lot of the gangster ways and how they really did things.<br/><br/>Summary: This is pretty much a biography on Henry Hill, who as a kid always wanted to be a gangster, and he actually worked for them. It shows how a young kid grew up helping the mafia and becoming a mobster himself. This is a true story and really shows what being a wise guy is all about.<br/><br/>Overall: Definitely a 10/10 movie. Really makes me want to be a wiseguy."

"tedg","Null","46","87","22 May 2002"," Italian Storytelling
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Competent filmmakers are rare -- there is no doubt that Scorsese is competent and should be celebrated on that score alone.<br/><br/>But his films are empty. They take you into a gangsterland (even `Temptation,' even `Innocence') and snap along until they end and then you leave. But you leave with nothing, and I expect more from a competent filmmaker.<br/><br/>The problem -- I speculate -- is the degree to which Scorsese is locked in the Italian tradition of storytelling and its 60's incarnation in neo-realistic films. This is a matter of performance, where the force of the story is all in the force of the storyteller. The performer here is Scorsese. His screen persona is epitomized in the Pesci character: driving, driving the group by pressing on. By speaking over others. By showing the threat of violence.<br/><br/>There's power here. It grabs your attention like Pesci grabs that of the fellas. I can see Scorsese constantly saying to himself that he'd be nuts to live any other way. But aside from some storytelling mechanics, there are no ideas here, no ambiguities, no interesting characters, no plot maturity, no symmetries, nothing to wonder about and discuss on your way home.<br/><br/>But we should salute some of the decisions. Scorsese chooses to frame the film as a story told by the Liotta character. (He plays an Irishman, but looks and acts Italian.) Narrative voiceovers. A clever framing device with us locked in the car at midway through and mirrored in the beginning. The end with Liotta looking directly and speaking into the camera and shooting us.<br/><br/>And the camera. Much has been said of the camera. The long, tracking shots, especially the much-copied entrance through the kitchen. The pullback-zoom toward the end when Liotta and DeNiro meet. The occasional corner ceiling shot. Normally I would love this, especially since it is in the framework of a consistent notion of the eye. What bothers me is what that eye is: it is dependent on the characters. <br/><br/>The characters drive this movie and pull the camera. Consider the kitchen entry scene: the camera is on a string behind Liotta. We follow, always follow, just as the fellas at Pesci's table have to follow his prattling. Compare that to dePalma's similar long tracking shot of Bruce Willis at the start of `Bonfire of the Vanities.' DePalma's camera isn't dragged along behind by the force of Willis. It floats to the front, the side, swooping around, independently curious. We the viewers are masters of the story. It's the difference between the northern and southern European storytelling traditions.<br/><br/>Seeing how little deference the camera gives us really grates when the payoff is so slight. It makes DeNiro pretty hard to take. Yes, we all get impressed by the power of his performance. But it is always clear that it is a performance: we are not seeing a character but a `serious actor,' employed as a tractor to pull us along.<br/><br/>Is this a great film? Well, it did not change my life, give my dreams new form, or provide the basis for any meaningful discussion with my wife. It didn't help me define myself or my world. It provided no new perspectives on the things I struggle with. (And many, many films do one or more of these things.) So for me no.<br/><br/>What a waste."
"bob the moo","Null","17","29","30 January 2002"," Classic modern day gangster film
","Starting with the 1950's, we follow Henry Hill from a teen who tries to realise his dream of `always wanting to be a gangster'.  He goes from running errands for Paulie Cicero to become a trusted man within his organisation.  Working with James Conway and Tommy De Vito, Henry navigates his violent lifestyle where death is never more than a few steps away.<br/><br/>For my generation this was one of our first introductions to Scorsese doing a real tour-de-force of a film - I was too young to appreciate Raging Bull and his 70's work when it first came out and the eighties were a quiet period (except the brilliant king of comedy).  So here was a great introduction to a fanatastic director.  The plot is spread over such a long time (in terms of story years) that it's hard to get beneath the surface events, but this is a very minor problem given that it's such a great ride. The focus is on events and the culture rather than a deep story and as such Scorsese works with set pieces and events rather than too much characterisation.  However the story moves so effectively through the action - Scorsese uses long tracking shots, pumping soundtracks and scenes of building tension and sudden violence to create a masterful experience.<br/><br/>The weakness with lack of depth is really put to the back of your mind by the action, the direction and the performances.  The story is well held together by Hill's narrative and the shallowness is easily over looked. Liotta is excellent as the aspiring gangster and is full of self seeking menace.  De Niro does what he does best in terms of the Irish gangster role but the standout is Pesci.  Pesci gives a strong role as the vicious Tommy and deserved his Oscar.  The rest of the cast are all excellent whether it's major roles (Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco) or minor characters (Frank Vincent, Sivero).<br/><br/>The real star here is Scorsese - he uses the camera and the soundtrack to great effect and gets great performances from his cast.  A modern gangster feast."

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>A film (one I'm sure you're all familiar with) charting the rise of Henry Hill, a young man growing up in a neighbourhood in 1950s New Jersey, who is in awe of the wise guys who lurk in his neighbourhood and the respect and power they command. With low prospects and an abusive father, Henry can see no other way to go than to become one of them and we follow him on his journey as he becomes ingratiated in them, the crimes he carries out for them, his marriage that starts well before going disasterously off the rails, a spell in jail after a job gone wrong and finally where he goes wildly off the rails when he starts taking/dealing drugs and him finally ending up having to testify against his former friends when he becomes a liability to them and they put out a contract on his head, which is still in force today.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro. Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci. Three men with faces you wouldn't want to mess with and all perfectly cast in the leading roles in Martin Scorsese's legendary crime epic. All men are on fine form but, in ironically the lesser role, special mention to Pesci who steals the show as the wildly psychotic Tommy.<br/><br/>Scorsese's masterpiece was one of the first films to really make use of the camera in new ways, from the long, lingering shot to the still shot, used excellently at various points in the movie. These are usually complimented by a fine 50s soundtrack playing over them, with some real lingering melodies from that era.<br/><br/>The story works on two levels, both enlighteningly as an expose of how the gangster world and the gangsters themselves actually have very similar philosophies and worries as normal 9-5 people (with regards to families and staying on top of the competition) as well as showing just why the attraction to that life is so great (hitting home most forcefully at the end when Henry is forced to acknowledge that he'll have to lead the rest of his life like a 'shnuck!') and also engagingly as we watch a man rise from nothing to great heights only to lose it all again through his own bad choices and misguided loyalties. Indeed, as the film spans four decades, we do leave the film feeling as though we've known these characters for years.<br/><br/>Coppola's The Godfather will remain the most accomplished crime epic of all time, but Scorsese's effort can never be scoffed at and will rightly remain one of the most well remembered films of it's sort, if you've got the stomach to sit through it in certain parts. *****"

But you cannot go as far as liking the ""hero"" or feeling anything for him except a mild sympathy. so, all in all I give this movie a 7 mark but do not really understand its ranking, except if some have mistaken it for the godfather..."
"richard_peers","6","87","202","21 February 2003"," So what's all the fuss about then?
","I bought this film on DVD on the strength of two things - one, de Niro's excellent track record, and two, the very high rating on IMDB (in the Top 50). Having watched it, I have to ask what all the fuss is about? This is a very ordinary film which explores at extreme length the intimate details of the lives of the most childish individuals ever committed to celluloid. Whether or not people like these really exist, I found it completely uninteresting. I have no idea why so many people are fascinated by the mafia - maybe it's envy of the power - but they should not hold a fascination for civilised human beings. People who deal out death as a punishment for the slightest reverse in their lives deserve to be ignored or reprimanded, not lauded and celebrated as in this film. For every Henry Hill, there are a thousand or more kept in poverty because of the crime which supports his odious lifestyle. It would be nice to think there was some kind of a moral ending, but even then, we see Henry selling out his colleagues just to keep himself somewhere nearer the feeding trough.<br/><br/>How anyone can rate this film so highly is beyond me; how so many of you IMDB browsers can and do, just beggars belief!"
"FilmSnobby","3","81","195","25 November 2005"," May I differ?
","Overrated in 1990, *Goodfellas* has grown even more overrated with the passage of 15 years. It's based on the -- I daresay -- untrustworthy recollections of a half-Irish, half-Sicilian mobster-turned-informant who recently, I am reliably informed, appears as an addled, half-witted guest on ""The Howard Stern Show"". The narrative arc, if one can accurately term it that, spans 30 years, roughly from 1950 to 1980. This, of course, gives Martin Scorsese every incentive to soak the background with dozens of pop-culture tunes ranging from Bobby Vinton to Derek and the Dominoes. His use of the last 3 lilting minutes of ""Layla"" as some sort of ironic counterpoint in the extended montage that reveals the corpses of a dozen gruesomely executed mobsters in various places across New York City only underscores his utterly conventional taste in music. One wonders whether Scorsese would've been happier as a Top 40 deejay instead of a filmmaker.<br/><br/>His conventionality -- a surprising development, given his success with such Seventies classics as *Mean Streets* and *Taxi Driver*, both infused with his uniquely individual aesthetic -- extends beyond the soundtrack to the actual movie itself. Lovers of this movie will doubtless be distressed to learn that the various stylistic techniques Scorsese uses here -- whip-pans, sudden freezes that supposedly add ironic punctuation to the narrative, even the use of pop music as commentary on a montage -- all derive from French (yes, I said French) auteurs from the New Wave school of the Sixties and Seventies. These same lovers of this movie would probably also consider Orson Welles to be an overrated old fuddy-duddy, but that doesn't stop Scorsese from pointlessly laying on at least two sequences of long tracking-shots through complicated spatial arrangements without cuts, the device Welles perfected if not wholly invented. (An even less impressive feat for Scorsese, who benefits from the technological advance of the Steadicam. Welles did it with old-fashioned cameras on dollies and hydraulic cranes.) I believe that all these borrowings betray Scorsese's fundamental, perhaps unconscious, lack of confidence in the power of his story, here.<br/><br/>For the screenplay, let it be said at once, is poorly constructed. The narrative focuses on trivial events, like a gofer getting shot in the foot during a card game or Paul Sorvino slicing garlic to atomic thinness, and then presents the world-famous Lufthansa heist through hearsay. The movie's main character, Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, hears a news report about the heist while in the shower. One may reasonably ask why we're in the shower with Henry when we should be in the getaway car with Robert De Niro's Jimmy Conway and his henchmen. This, of course, leads one to reasonably ask why we're not watching a movie about Jimmy Conway instead of Henry Hill, the latter being, more often than not, on the periphery of the movie's main events. Having Liotta narrate the exciting stuff for us in voice-over is no substitute. Indeed, the movie is cripplingly dependent on voice-over narration, perhaps because Mr. Hill's own story, in and of itself, isn't interesting enough to really warrant a honest-to-goodness movie in the first place. As the movie drones on with Liotta's loquacious narrator ceaselessly filling in the narrative gaps, one suspiciously wonders -- for example -- why Hill and Conway are NOT whacked for bumping off ""made man"" Billy Bats, while Joe Pesci's Tommy DOES get whacked. All three men were involved in the killing, yet only Tommy pays the price. Why? Does Conway's and Hill's Irishness serve as a magical force-field? -- I don't get it. Well, I did say at the beginning of this review that Hill was an untrustworthy storyteller. From the evidence, it appears that Hill was quite conversant with his mob boss's cooking techniques (hence all the time wasted on cooking scenes and shots of gorgeously laid-out family feasts) and far less conversant with the important incidents that are the subject of this film. Note too how inconsistently handled Henry's character is throughout the film: one moment he pistol-whips almost to death a sexual predator who messes with his girlfriend, the next he's aghast when some punk kid gets carelessly killed. Hmm -- smells like self-hagiography to me.<br/><br/>After an overly-edited, chaotic, 30-minute final act in which a sweaty-faced, puffy-eyed Liotta drives around the suburbs, peering up through his windshield at police helicopters, dropping off hot guns, going to the grocery store, zipping back home to make meatballs (AGAIN with the cooking!), and so forth, he gets pinched for good. Under the umbrella of the Witness Protection program, he finally rats out his mob bosses . . . and it occurs to us that this should have been the focus of the film all along, i.e., the FBI's successful eroding of the criminal code using Witness Protection. But Scorsese crams it in during the last five minutes of this 3-hour movie. A little less time in the kitchen and in the shower, and a little more time getting down to business, might have made this movie pretty great.<br/><br/>As it is, the performers give *Goodfellas* undeniable energy, almost mitigating all its flaws. Fans of good New York actors will forgive this movie everything: Liotta, De Niro, Pesci, Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco do THEIR job, at least. And perhaps this is why the movie is so well-loved. Colorful characters limned by great performances are entertaining. But, in my judgment, the virtues of verisimilitude can't overcome what amounts to a 3-hour-long non-story.<br/><br/>3 stars out of 10."

","Typical Scorsese effort: average crime movie script dressed up with great acting and pretentious, way overly stylish camera-work.<br/><br/>I'm amazed this movie holds anyone's attention, let alone earns the ""best movie ever!"" praise you hear about this one. As I said, I didn't think it was bad, it was just wasn't that good. I had to force myself to keep watching, trying once again to see what other people see in Scorsese. I get the feeling all the praise and accolades heaped on him are just a big prank being played on me.<br/><br/>At least the Godfather was an actual good movie, although certainly no masterpiece.<br/><br/>A far, far better movie than this that came out around the same time would be Miller's Crossing. It's actually entertaining--you don't feel like killing yourself after watching it for just a few minutes, which is another thing about Scorsese I don't like. His slickness, bleak subject matter, unredeeming violence all combine to create an effect like a low-frequency earthquake hum or day-old shellfish--it's nauseating and depressing. I honestly spend the rest of the day depressed and joyless after watching a Scorsese film. You may say that's the power of the film maker, but I say that's simply the power of the subject matter. Manos: the Hands of Fate is pretty depressing for much the same reason.<br/><br/>Art shouldn't always be uplifting (I love Bicycle Thief and the Year of Living Dangerously) but if it's going to put such misery on the screen then it should have a good reason for doing it and it should teach me something.<br/><br/>A good example of how hollow the praise for Scorsese and his works rings is the famous Copacabana scene, a two or three minute steadicam shot following two characters from the outside of a nightclub as they wind through the kitchens and so forth and end up at their table. Scorsese's fans call this ""the best shot ever."" As I said, it's a long shot of a fellow getting a table. Kubrick did great tracking shots too, but the key to a great tracking shot, like any shot, is that it communicates something significant to us, puts us in the state of mind of the characters, etc. But this was just some people walking to their table. The difference is contextual and often subtle, but it's there."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","10","18","7 March 2008"," A Masterpiece That Gets Better With Each New Viewing
","Goodfellas (1990) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's masterpiece about Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a man who grew up hoping to be in the mob and he got his but crime does not pay as the old saying goes. GOODFELLAS has been called one of the greatest mob movies ever made and it's been called the best film of the 90s as well as one of the greatest films ever made. It certainly goes on my list as one of the greatest movies ever made and each time I view the thing I can't help but be amazed at the brilliance on screen. It's really does seem as if this isn't a movie because the thing is so perfect in every way that it's almost hard to believe that it's real. Even though everything in this movie is great there's no doubt that every ounce of credit belongs to Scorsese.<br/><br/>There have been wonderful crime pictures going all the way back to the silent days so the director was behind the eight ball but instead of just delivering a great movie he instead goes all out and really creates a film unlike anything we've ever seen before. The way he films the violence, shows the good times and the bad times. Everything is so flawless that you really do forget that you're watching a movie because it comes off like you're a fly on the wall witnessing all of this stuff first hand. There's the now legendary camera shot going through the restaurant, there's the terrific music score and of course the violence that really shakes you. One could argue that we've seen this type of story countless times but it's so fresh here that you can't help but feel as if you're seeing it for the first time.<br/><br/>There are so many brilliant moments here but special credit has to go to the final twenty-minutes or so when Hill finally starts to crack due to all the drugs. The fast-paced nature of this sequence is among the most perfect filming you're ever going to see because by the time it's over you're going to think that you too are high on drugs. Another amazing thing that Scorsese does is get you into the events in these people's lives. The good times early on are so much fun that you can see why someone would select to be in the lifestyle. The camera doesn't shy away from capturing these moments including the high times in the nightclubs with the women and the money. However, Scorsese also nails the downside when everything starts to crumble and the violence is so shocking and brutal that you then realize that this lifestyle only ends one way and you're thankful that you're not involved in it.<br/><br/>Another major plus are of course the performances. Liotta is perfect in the role of Hill and especially when you consider he must carry the film over the more famous actors. I thought Liotta perfectly nailed not only the young, energetic Hill but he really pulled off the drug-crazed maniac. DeNiro, as usual, is also terrific in his part as he brings so much fire and energy to the character and can cause you to fear him with just a look. Joe Pesci deserves his Best Supporting Actor Oscar as there's no doubt that he delivers one of the finest villain roles in the history of film. Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are also impressive as are the rest of the supporting players even down to the bit parts.<br/><br/>GOODFELLAS is without question one of the greatest films ever made and like all classics it's a movie that keeps getting better each passing year. Scorsese has made many great films in his career and this here is certainly among his best."
"mr_tambourine_man72","1","153","411","9 August 2004"," Trash. Utter trash.
","Goodfellas makes a strong case for itself as the most overrated movie of the 80s or any decade. Never in my life have I encountered a film less deserving of its critical and popular accolades. After watching it for the second time recently (to make sure my impression from a viewing years earlier was accurate), I feel every person involved in the picture, and particularly Martin Scorsese, deserves to be punished severely for inflicting Goodfellas upon me.<br/><br/>Goodfellas has absolutely nothing to offer. It has neither the wisdom nor the compassion to say or reveal anything about life or human beings. Anyway, Goodfellas is not interested in that. It just wants to be smart, hip, and funny. With such lofty goals, it's a wonder this entire star-studded cast of actors and filmmakers fell so very, very short. <br/><br/>Goodfellas is not smart. It is not intelligent enough to understand what it think it portrays on an individual or larger basis. It does not somehow explain or explore the mob psyche, the existence of organized crime in America, or anything else for that matter. Despite the fact that it is taken from actual events and people, it seems to desire no contact with reality.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is not hip. Apparently Martin Scorsese was not aware that there is nothing less cool than trying hard to be cool. Goodfellas is full of flashy camera moves, tough looking guys in swank suits, and more fast, colloquial dialogue than you could beat out of Dashiell Hammett, but none of it adds up to anything but slime. Yes, that's right: slime. Goodfellas is so obnoxious you want to take a magical eraser and scrub each of its characters back into the pure white on the page from which they sprang. Is this an honorable aim for a film? To make you hate its characters, to make you hate its voice? Let me be the one to say that cynicism is generally a good cover for laziness, and as an approach to life it is one step above nihilism. Real cynicism has no place in art. <br/><br/>Goodfellas is not funny. A complete lack of respect for human life is not a secret recipe for brilliant ironic comedy. It is disgusting, really, and those who laugh reserve a spot for themselves in the grime between the cracks under the bottom of the barrel of good humor.<br/><br/>The performances in Goodfellas, much lauded, are ridiculously one-sided. How wonderful they managed to span the chasm between looking tough and looking smug - all except for Ray Liotta who has to do the balancing act between being paranoid and annoyed. Bravo.<br/><br/>Of note is Scorsese's choice to play pop music over 95 percent of the film, presumably so that we have something to listen to while we are busy ignoring his movie.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is trash. Utter trash. The only thing I took out of it is that it is unwise to let a gangster stand behind you."

Also, there's no ""mafia"" or ""families"" really to speak of. And a majority of the characters are Irish, not Italian. I liked all the different characters involved, the wiseguys, the losers, the brutes, the smart AND dumb people, you name it. The fighting/shooting/heist scenes were perfectly executed (no pun intended). Ray Liotta is great as Henry Hill, he explains everything so well and makes ""the life"" look great. Robert DeNiro really proved himself once again in the part of Jimmy Conway. And Joe Pesci was perfect to play Tommy DeVito. All the supporting/side characters were great as well. I give this a 10/10, which I don't do very often but this movie deserves it."

","Semi-spoiler<br/><br/>On a personal note...this movie was filmed, in part, in front of my family's home (the red house across from Bracco's ""home"" in the movie...you know the scene...Ray Liotta runs across the street and pistol whips the neighbor's son, who is polishing his red Corvette - since I was, in reality, the son who lived across the street, I suppose, that was me taking all that punishment).  Anyway, I was home visiting when they filmed for over a month on my street.  It was interesting to watch the care (bordering on fanaticism) that Scorcese took in endlessly rehearsing minor scenes and then finally filming them.  Which leads me to my point.  <br/><br/>So much time, money, and effort spent to produce such an unpleasant film. Lord knows, it's not that everybody needs to be Pollyanna...we all are aware how truly wretched life can be...but why spend time watching loathsome, worthless characters act out pointless violence?  There just has to be some better way of spending our time.  Yep, we are base animals...as Scorcese incessantly likes to remind us in this and his other films...Thank you!  We get the idea!  However, why not take all that talent and time and produce something the uplifts the human spirit rather than denigrates it?  ""A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?""

Also, when you have 240-plus f-words in a movie, I mean, come on! In that respect alone, I'm embarrassed to say this movie is part of my collection. That's simply because it's a fascinating story, for the full 145 minutes.<br/><br/>This is a rough film, to say the least. It's not just the language; there are some brutally- violent parts. Joe Pesci's ""Tommy DeVito"" seems to be involved with some of the worst of that violence Supposedly, the movie is a based on a true story but how much of this is true, who knows? It certainly provides a vivid portrait of Mafia life in New York City. I really loved the narration by Ray Liotta - who doesn't? - and enjoyed the music in here. Most people comment about the music; it's a good soundtrack. Pesci, Liotta, Robert De Niro and Paul Sorvino all make for extremely interesting gangster characters. <br/><br/>With all the language, which includes at least 15 usages of the Lord's name in vain and some subtle religious cheap shots (not surprising considering who directed the film), the gory spots this film gets a little too rough-edged at times. I've watched thousands of crime movies, and this gets to be a little much here and there but if none of the above offends you, you're in for a treat with an intense crime story that is very watchable."

The performances in this film by everyone are so thorough that it is impossible to tell they're acting. No other crime film has ever kept me entertained, interested and alert as long or as effectively as Goodfellas.<br/><br/>After I saw the Godfather and didn't think it measured up to the hype at all,(it was still an amazing movie, don't get me wrong), I concluded that I was simply not a fan of gangster films.

Scorcese was born to make this movie, it's impossible to study it the first few times you watch because it sweeps you up and dumps you down at the end. It leaves you breathless. There is brutal violence, drug use, and colourful language, but there's no use complaining because this is the mafia, these are bad people, what do you expect? <br/><br/>Told in flashback it is based on the story of Henry Hill, a boy who grows up dreaming of making it in the Mafia, he works his way into the higher ranks of the organised crime syndicate and through a stunning series of set pieces his coke-addled paranoia shows us his downfall and eventual fate. There are various voice-overs to give the action a sense of perspective, but there are so many things going on it's best just to let it flow.<br/><br/>De Niro and Pesci are at the top of their game, and the supporting cast give this film a weight unmatched by many.

"luisk1989","10","6","10","5 July 2012"," My favourite of all gangster flicks
","Goodfellas by director Martin Scorsese is by far my most favourite gangster movie of all times. It's one of those movies that, despite its runtime of over 2 hours, I can watch again and again without ever getting bored at any time. <br/><br/>What it clearly sets it above other masterpieces of this genre like 'The Godfather' is that every scene gives me something. While many other movies of its kind tend to have scenes that get a bit tiresome or just aren't that interesting or entertaining, 'Goodfellas' succeeds to deliver top-notch entertainment until the end. <br/><br/>This is, of course, thanks to the extremely well written script and to the perfect cast. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro who play the main characters give so good performances, that I could not think of any other actor to play any of those roles and the rest of the cast is equally good. <br/><br/>The movie has a perfect pacing which is also thanks to the narration of Henry Hill alias Ray Liotta. His voice accompanies us through the whole movie and is definitely a huge fun factor. He delivers his story so well that you virtually live through this movie with him. When he describes how he got into the organization and what it's like to be a wiseguy, you really comprehend and feel it. <br/><br/>Then there are the technical aspects of the movie. The camera work is brilliant with very long tracking shots and scenes without a cut which take you as an invisible spectator along through the scenes. And last but not least there's the music. Scorsese makes use of well-known pop music of that time, which really adds to the atmosphere as a whole.<br/><br/>In the end, 'Goodfellas' is my favourite Scorsese and gangster movie as well. There are very few movies (of that length and scope) that manage to deliver such a constant and high entertainment value from start to finish, but this is one that does."

","Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is quintessentially one of the greatest movies ever. It is better than The Godfather in my opinion because of its real life approach to mob life. The film follows Henry Hill as he is brought into the mob life at a young age and how it brings him down at the end. The movie is just amazing to watch as it is like watching a documentary on the what is like to be in the mob. Adding to it are the amazing performances put forth by Ray Liotta as Henry,Robert De Niro as his friend Jimmy the Gent who is great in it and Lorraine Bracco who is very good as Henry's wife. But the performance worth mentioning is Joe Pesci's awesome performance as Tommy De Vito. His acting in it is one of the best performances I've ever seen. The film follows a time line from the 1950's to the 1980's and with it accompanies one of the greatest soundtracks ever put together. Scorcese has a knack for putting great soundtracks together and this is one of the greatest he's ever produced. Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies ever and one of Scorsese's all time best."

Few actors have that ability in my opinion, Brando and Pacino are two who do and who would have struggled to match De Niro. De Niro was supported well to say the least with great performances by Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta and Paul Sorvino. Every time you watch this film you see something different and it reminds you that this film is a masterpiece.

I'll take the heat from any fans and I know there are scores of them...Goodfellas was average at best and simply a trashy look at a mobster from childhood to his end in the mob with some decent but over the top performance, brutally gratuitous language and violence. I suppose in some circles that equivalents to a great film but I need far more. I mean even the story has little depth to it and it's more or less an extended episode of The Sopranos without the character depth. I suppose after having the film hyped for years and hearing about the 'classic' I had high expectations but for me it was run of the mill, annoyingly loud and abrasive but with some good direction. Scorsese knows how to make an epic from beginning to end starting the film in the 50's and 60's and taking it all the way to the mid 80's is a challenge and he does it flawlessly. The gritty underworld, the dark lighting, the facial expressions all very good but put to a pointless story and sub par characters unfortunately.<br/><br/>I finally know now why Ray Liotta is still around and still gets parts because I always found him a little obnoxious in roles and I never realized he single handedly headlined Goodfellas and is great at it. His character might be the only one in the film given any depth considering he is the narrator and focus of the film. Disgustingly Liotta got no nomination that year which is absurd because if this film deserved anything (which I don't think it did) Liotta's role was it. Robert Deniro commonly gets credit for the film as being the headliner which is also a bit absurd. He might be the big name for the film but his role was small. He didn't make a significant part in the film until a good hour into it and his role was small but he still certainly brought his Deniro class and style to the ensemble. I think they would have done better to focus more on his character and his relationship with Liotta's character. They had good chemistry but just when you wanted to see more...they moved on to something else. Joe Pesci was over the top insane, downright disturbed Tommy Devito. His performance in this film is legendary ""Oh you think I'm a clown?"" but to be perfectly honest he was ridiculous. His performance wasn't sincere or believable and he was downright annoying. He was loud and abrasive and his barrage of gratuitous language actually made the film less watchable and I am not against the use of four letter words in film but his was too much. Lorraine Bracco was quite good in her pre-Soprano role as Liotta's wife Karen who sticks with him through pretty much everything and has some powerfully emotional swings throughout the film. Paul Sorvino is good as the head of the mob family, Paulie, but he doesn't make an impact. You don't really believe anyone would respect him. He's quiet and laid back and basically hiding throughout most of the film. At least with Brando's Godfather he was an image, an icon, something you just were in awe of. The cast all work well together but their characters are so thinly written you just don't give a damn about a single one of them except maybe a little for Liotta's Jimmy Conway.<br/><br/>I get that I'm in a severe minority speaking this way about this film and that director Martin Scorsese is like a god to some but I just didn't seem the talent in this film. Scorsese showed talent in The Departed and the cast was a million times better than Goodfellas and deserved all of it's acclaim but I personally think Goodfellas is more of a non-thinking man's mob movie where bloody brutal kills and 1000 times hearing the 'F' word would prompt a dull chuckle as though the audience were 10. No I am not trying to insult anyone I was just severely disappointed by this film after having expected a brilliant classic which I will say hands down is not the case. I suppose if you like the crime genre or moreso the gangster drama than you must see Goodfellas anyways but I can promise you there is FAR better out there than this average, poorly written film. 6/10"

","Roebrt De Niro,Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci star in this film about the mob and gangsters in ""Goodfellas"". Based on the bestselling book of Nicholas Pillegi, director Martin Scorsese provides the viewer of a clear picture of what being part of organized crime is all about. <br/><br/>Goodfellas is a true story that is being told on the eyes of Henry Hill,who spent 25 years of his life being a member of the mob from 1955 to 1980, until he became an informant and made deals with the FBI to bring down and put behind the bars his mob underboss Paul Cicero and his fellow mobster, Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway. The story whose script was co-written by Scorsese and Pileggi narrates Hill's story on how he started being of service with the mob when he was 12 years old when he considered being a gangster is better than being the President of the United States until he became a full-time gangster who was involved in extortion,hijacking,stealing,robberies and murders together with Tommy DeVito and Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway when he became an adult. It shows how much money he has had that made him and his wife - Karen Hill - have made their married life extremely comfortable,appealing and glamorous.Added to that,the viewer is treated to the glory years - the 50's,60's and 70's - of the mob when these crime families have many law enforcers in their pockets and how much impact they had in American society until they started to decline and experience downfall in the 80's when the FBI started to intensify their campaign against the mob and putting these mobsters into prison.<br/><br/>No question that we have a great film.There are many reasons behind it.First,the viewer is given a clear portrait of the mob's way of life particularly the life of crime as told by Henry Hill.It definitely does not intend to put any glamor into their way of life as it clearly shows how violent this way of life is despite the money that they are able to earn.This was shown particularly in the scenes wherein Tommy DeVito,portrayed by Pesci in an Oscar winning role,shoots Spider on the foot and later killed him by shooting his chest six times after losing his temper.It also shows how much crime they commit in their daily life.Added to that,it also demonstrates how mob life has declined throughout the years starting in the 1980's when the FBI intensified in bringing down members of the mob and putting them behind bars with the use of advancement in technology that the Feds are using particularly in investigating mobsters. It definitely shows that the mob no longer has the same impact unlike during their glory years from the 1950's to the 1970's and the viewer probably laughing to Henry's mindset that being a gangster is better than becoming US President.Many will see that Henry himself became an FBI informant and corroborate against his fellow mobsters in the end receive lighter sentence instead of spending the rest of his life in jail.<br/><br/>Aside from these reasons,we also get to see a lot of great performances from De Niro,Liotta,Sorvino,Bracco,who was nominated for an Oscar Best Supporting Actress; and Pesci,who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.In addition to performances,we also get to see a great direction from Scorsese that told the story in a fast pace that made 2 hour and 28 minute movie far from being boring; and a wonderful screenplay from Scorsese and Pileggi as well that made many scenes memorable up to day since this was first shown in the theaters many years ago back in 1990.<br/><br/>No wonder the ""Goodfellas"" remains popular today since it was released 27 years ago."

Henry, however, is badly affected by his partners success and decided to bring about the downfall of his mob partners.<br/><br/>Goodfellas has one great achievement about organized crime and the mob.It portrays the benefits of being part of the mob and at the same time puts guilt upon them and never glamorizes them one bit.Also,it narrates man's constant lust for power and greed.Overall,this is one great crime classic."
"tml_pohlak_13","10","5","8","30 June 2009"," As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster...
","To be frank, ""Goodfellas"" is probably the best crime movie ever made. It is more than just a movie; it tells a captivating tale; it is perfectly cast; Scorsese's direction is at its utmost brilliance. In fact, I'd venture to say that ""Goodfellas"" far surpasses what Francis Ford Coppola's much-loved ""The Godfather"" has to offer.<br/><br/>In the first place, the entire sympathy for the characters of ""The Godfather"" depended on portraying them more as a dysfunctional family. This is not what a crime film should be. A crime film should be about *crime*, not men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other. The characters of ""Goodfellas"" are, above all, gangsters. As a matter of fact, one of the very first lines is ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"". At the same time, however, Martin Scorsese does not glorify violence. He does not overemphasize blood spattering or disturbing death sequences. The violence here is realistic, precisely because it's cold, cruel, and emotionless. As a result, this film is one of the more realistic, plausible, and believable crime films out there.<br/><br/>Another thing that is better about ""Goodfellas"" is its length, 146 minutes compared to ""The Godfather""'s 175. That might not seem like much at first, but think about it. That's just short of a half-hour. ""The Godfather"", as is, could've easily been trimmed down by an hour. That can't be said about ""Goodfellas"". Things just happen in the film; it's interesting all the way, even during its more contemplative parts. Additionally, the characters of ""Goodfellas"" are really compelling, but I will avoid going in-depth here.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is, as I've mentioned, at the top of his game when directing ""Goodfellas"". One particular shot near the end stands out. Scorsese makes use of the (as I like to call it) ""Vertigo effect"" (ie zooming in while tracking backwards; the characters in the foreground remain approx. the same size while there is a significant shift in the background). This shot has been overused to the point of becoming clichÃ©, yet it works effectively here. This is just one instance of Scorsese's fantastic work on this film. He constantly keeps the audience engaged in the film and the characters. In the blink of an eye, a scene can shift from comedic to horrific. Yet such transitions never seem jarring or awkwardly paced.<br/><br/>One more thought about the film: the upbeat soundtrack that accompanies ""Goodfellas"" is actually really well pulled off. Whenever a song plays, it fits in perfectly with the action, both in melody and lyrics.<br/><br/>The Verdict: This is what a crime film should be all about: realistic, entertaining, gripping. ""Goodfellas"" is just about flawless.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10/10"
"kpt4001","10","5","8","23 June 2007"," A terrific film which depicts the insanity of a career in the mafia.
","By and far the largest complaint I hear from people is the use of voice-over in film. Many complain of how it destroys the purpose of a movie as a visual medium. ""The actors should convey emotion through their acting, not through voice-over,"" these critics might say. I argue that in certain cases, voice-over can make a film better. ""Goodfellas"" is my proof that v/o helps a film (as well as terrific direction, masterful cinematography, Schoonmakerian editing and a killer soundtrack, but those are givens in a Scorsese flick). How else could we really understand Henry Hill's incredible story of prosperity and joy which eventually turns into one of paranoia and depression?<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" is the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a low ranking soldier (or something like that) in boss Paul Cicero's crew of Brooklyn wise guys. It's also about his friends and partners in crime Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco). It begins with good times spread around, but due to some poor decision making on everyone's part, the good times don't last long.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" is a mix of black comedy and dark drama which is all the more affecting because of the humanity of the two main characters, Henry and Karen Hill. Karen is especially sympathetic due to her innocence. She tries to rationalize her husband's actions in her v/o, as Henry explains everything he thinks in his v/o.<br/><br/>Back to the point of v/o: It is necessary for Henry to speak his mind in v/o because as ""Sopranos"" creator David Chase said, these guys usually are lying when they talk to their fellow mafia members.<br/><br/>The one thing I haven't mentioned is the incredible acting by the whole cast. Liotta and Bracco shine here more than anyone else in the cast. (Yeah, Pesci is the most memorable part of this movie according to many other people, but he was much better in ""Raging Bull"" as was De Niro*. That's saying something about ""Raging Bull"" because Pesci won an Oscar for this film.) Everyone else here was great too.<br/><br/>Overall, Goodfellas is a must see for any Scorsese fan. It's my favorite movie of his and I think his magnum opus. Marty grew up around these people, so who better to tell their story? <br/><br/>*Robert De Niro is excellent movie he does. He probably even did research on the CIA and the florist industry for ""Meet the Fockers""."
"john_meyer","2","26","62","2 June 2013"," Tedious cartoon characterizations
","Many people think Scorsese is a great director because he is a skilled craftsman who produces a clear realization of his own weirdly fractured vision. Given the reverence with which some people treat his work, any criticism may be viewed as sacrilege. <br/><br/>However, this film is filled with wooden, cartoon characterizations of real people. They do very ugly things to each other, but without any understanding of their motivations.<br/><br/>The movie drags on far too long thanks to countless scenes that should have been shortened or cut (e.g., the endlessly long prison kitchen scene). The transitions between different phases of the movie are abrupt and without explanation. For instance, the transition to drug addiction and trafficking comes out of nowhere when the main character pulls pills out of his pocket and swallows them on his way to jail in a limousine. No drug use is shown or even hinted at prior to that scene.<br/><br/>While the movie certainly progresses over time, and there is definitely plot development, the cardboard characters don't really change, and every scene seems like a repeat of something we just saw. <br/><br/>Unlike ""The Godfather,"" to which this film is sometimes compared because they both depict the ""inner workings"" of the East Coast Mafia, there is no deeper insight into any part of the human condition, and only the shallowest revelations about why the Mafia even exists. The only thing we are given -- explained in clumsy narration at the end of the movie -- is that all the participants are drawn to each other because they enjoy a sense of belonging: of being ""good fellas."" While the irony between that explanation and the extended depiction of these beautifully bonded people eating their own is certainly acknowledged, in the end none of it really makes sense, and we are reminded of that too-frequently quoted Shakespeare line:<br/><br/>It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury Signifying nothing<br/><br/>Macbeth was clearly talking about Goodfellas."

This is one you need to see in your life time.<br/><br/>But, of course no movie is perfect. Where two of the main characters shine, the lead does not. A clear example of this shows in one particular part of the movie. Early on in the movie there is a scene where Tommy (Joe Pesci), Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Henry (Ray Liotta) turn up to Tommy's mothers house after murdering Billy Batts. Famously, the conversations in this scene were improvised. When sticking to that theme though, Ray Liotta was famously quiet. This was pretty obvious as it was pointed out by Tommy's mother in the movie (Catherine Scorsese).<br/><br/>I give my praise to Martin Scorsese for making what is and probably always will be a movie classic."

","I suppose a lot of people found the characters in this film compelling and relatable on a basic human level. From what I saw, virtually all of the characters are low kinds of scum, always willing to betray one another and murder for kicks. The protagonist, played by Ray Liota, lacks the depth or redeeming characteristics that Cagney and Al Pacino's gangsters had. Liota's Henry Hill has very little that would make him seem like somebody to care about, because he's always willing to betray people and lie to save his own skin. When he gets his comeuppance, the viewer knows he richly deserves it, and will find no reason to take his side. His colleagues in crime, played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are equally irredeemable. The only decent qualities about De Niro and Liota is that they are not quick to condone random murder, as Pesci is always apt to do. The level of violence in this movie is gratuitous and disgusting. It does little to glamorize the life of crooks, and instead makes it seem like a low, loathsome venture.<br/><br/>This movie is full of violence and little in the way of decent themes, as virtually all the characters are too slimy to convey anything relatable to the viewer on a basic level, except that we sometimes betray others to save ourselves. The acting is decent, though not something to write home about. The plot is winding and tortuous, so pay very close attention if you want to understand the action. The plot actually seems secondary, more like a framework for a menagerie of blood-and-guts and gangster dialogue. I do enjoy movies that feature prominent ultra-violence, like ""Robocop"" and ""Sin City,"" but those movies had deep characters and themes about morality that this movie does not explore. Watch it if you wish, but don't expect this to be the classic everyone seems to think it is.<br/><br/>PS: Listen for the phrase ""you're busting my balls."" Virtually all the main characters say it. You could play a drinking game with this movie for all the times the characters say that phrase. This likely inspired a scene in the TV series ""South Park,"" where Cartman says this phrase to people who refuse his offer to buy aborted fetuses. Good times."

"mnpollio","7","9","18","24 April 2012"," Slick, flashy, often brilliant, yet cannot make you give a hoot about its characters
","Goodfellas is a technically impressive film and interesting to review largely because of the huge following it has amongst film critics and Martin Scorsese fanatics alike, most of whom reverentially believe it is his best workand they may be correct.<br/><br/>The story based on a novel by Nicholas Pileggi chronicles the rise through the ranks of the Mafia of Irish-Sicilian Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who has always wanted to be a gangster since he was a kid, and finds his wish granted. We follow him from a rambunctious teen to his first arrest, his marriage to Jewish wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) through to their fall into drugs, and finally as an informer prior to entry into the Witness Protection Program.<br/><br/>The film has a dry sense of humor and is technically and visually amazing. Scorsese loves the mobster milieu and is obviously working in his element here with a nicely picked cast. The attention to detail, the camera work, the costumes, the choice of music is all well thought out to the most intimate minutiae. The film is a fairly fascinating peek at life inside the Mafia. Scorsese allows events to unfold believably and the moments near the end where Henry and Karen become increasingly paranoid that they are under surveillance, complete with jittery, over bright intense camera work that heightens their unease, is arguably some of Scorsese's best work.<br/><br/>The acting is fairly solid. Liotta manages to hold things together as the focal character and he gets nice support from Bracco. DeNiro manages a dignified turn as Liotta's mentor and friend. Joe Pesci won the Oscar as the psychotic killer Tommy DeVito. He is utilized well enough here to overlook the fact that it is basically the same performance he gives in everything else.<br/><br/>Yet as amazing as the film is, it still has its drawbacks that prevent it from becoming the classic that many of its admirers would have you believe. As fascinating as Goodfellas is, I actually find Scorsese's similarly themed subsequent work Casino just as impressive technically, yet far more interesting in that it tells its tale using the backdrop of the formation of gambling mecca Las Vegas. I realize that I am in the minority with that view, but there it is.<br/><br/>Yet most notable of all is that Goodfellas seems utterly incapable of connecting on an emotional level with the viewer. The superior Godfather films featured similar themes and focused on characters capable of shocking acts of violence, yet managed to connect on an emotional level so that we had some concern for the players. By contrast, at the end of Goodfellas, as brilliant as I thought some of the direction and technical aspects were, I found that I did not give a damn what happened to any of the characters on screen, including Henry and Karen. I was completely indifferent to whether they lived, died, escaped, etc. And this issue makes for a somewhat empty viewing experience.<br/><br/>1990 was a very interesting film year. Coppola released his last Godfather film that year. Although it got an Oscar nod, critics largely overlooked it in favor of Goodfellas due to the fact that it is not on the same level as its predecessors. There is no question Godfather III is a flawed film, but it is also more emotionally rich than Goodfellas and any one of its flaws is more interesting to discuss at length than any of Goodfellas successes. Conversely, critics and Scorsese fans have spilled gallons of ink over the ""injustice"" of Dances With Wolves winning the Best Picture over Goodfellas, but it is not hard to see why it did. DWW in its own right is just as technically impressive as Goodfellas (maybe even more so considering its director was an amateur with a passionate vision), but DWW connects emotionally with the viewer in a far more powerful way than Goodfellas ever does. At the end of DWW and Godfather III, I had to know what happened with those characters. At the end of Goodfellas, not so much. <br/><br/>What Scorsese has achieved is certainly noteworthy and makes for a very good, solid gangster film, but most definitely not a masterpiece. It is slick, flashy and technically well done (sometimes even brilliant), but its inability to make me give a damn about any of its characters is a huge stumbling block."

By this time Henry is so entangled in the mafia that it has become his whole social life  from his friends, his wife, his job to his values  he is consumed in a camaraderie. The film is based on a true story and given its content and realistic photography approach, it feels strangely like a documentary. Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up on the gritty crime-infested streets of New York said: ""I remember seeing it on the streets and thinking, this is the way a movie should look like."" <br/><br/>To convey this realistic tone, the camera thus coldly follows Henry around everywhere and it does not shy away from violence or unpleasant diversions, as is Scorsese's style. It invests the whole film in a behind-the-scenes atmosphere, where the director expertly wields a long, continuous reel of exclusive footage. Several takes are of steadicams gliding through the world for minutes, as when Henry and Karen park their cark, cross the street and enter the Copacopana where they are pampered by Henry's connections. It's raw and unflinching and truly absorbs you in Henry's life as a wiseguy, climbing the mafia hierarchy. He often botches his way through jobs; he has a hard time whacking people and he clumsily cheats on his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco)  the danger of the character is that you like him. Ray Liotta fantastically sews together the events as they unfold in a patient voice-over narrative flow. <br/><br/>This flow is the film's fatal flaw. Sure, the pacing starts out nicely enough by having Henry slowly climb the mafia ladder along with his wiseguy friends Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci), both of whom are equally charismatic characters  the latter with rapid-fire dialogue and a rapid-fire gun and Pesci winning an Oscar for his colourful performance. It's all compelling at first BUT as is the usual mistake by Scorsese... he dilutes his film. It's like he got so taken with the mafia content that he wanted so much more of it for his own self-indulgence. There are numerous scenes that serve no other purpose than giving us a feel for the mafia family and the way things are run. It is true that some of them are important for establishing the atmosphere, but there are too many of them. The pace thus shifts from patient to lingering and the plot suffers countless detours and diversion into the life of crime. It loses focus.<br/><br/>I cannot figure out whether this 'diluting the film' approach is Scorsese's style or an unfortunate mistake he keeps repeating in every film of his. Nevertheless, it makes Goodfellas dawdle leisurely without any clear sense of point or direction for long periods of time. Everything else in the film is fantastic, no hyperbole. Scorsese takes a deep plunge into wiseguy culture, indulging in mob dialogue that snaps and crackles like kindling in a fireplace, brutal hits, sleek heists and rats. He navigates moods, themes, characters, and popular music (which is used throughout as a background device) with expert skill and less than twenty minutes into the film, you are so absorbed in the characters' lives of crime that you know of nothing else. <br/><br/>As for acting, it is Ray Liotta who grabs my attention as Henry, and not the resident scene-stealer Robert De Niro. I also fell in love with Lorraine Bracco's performance as Henry's Jewish wife  whose kickass attitude and sparkling personality translates well on camera. The greatest sheer presence can best be attributed to Paul Sorvino as the big-shot boss Paulie who, in spite of not saying a word until half of the film has passed, communicates a fantastic lethality. The reason the whole ensemble shines in their performances stems from the fact that they aren't acting like their characters; they are behaving like them. Of course the whole of Goodfellas is of the utmost quality but it could be even greater by being more condensed, as good most of Martin Scorsese's long-winded, diluted and slightly self-indulgent films.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","Here in Crete Greece there are many films shown during the night on TV so my wife and I use the users comments to decide which films to record to watch at a decent hour. This film being 19th in the top 250 film was a must to record.<br/><br/>Without a doubt this is a well made film, with atmospheric photography and very good acting. The violence which we saw although harsh was artistic and thus a bit detached from reality. In fact we found the style of the film rather too artistic and atmospheric and after a 40 minutes we looked at each other and agreed we were bored by it. We could not relate to any or the characters in the film nor did we care what happened to them. So we turned it off and deleted it to make space for another film."

"tieman64","Null","8","16","6 November 2009"," May Fold Under Questioning
","""Goodfellas"" is championed as a ""gangster movie"", but like most of Scorsese's pictures it's also a religious movie concerned about the destructive aspects of devotion. The film begins with one of its few moments of authenticity – a nightmarish sequence in which several gangsters knife a man to death in the trunk of their car - before zooming into the starry eyes of Henry Hill, a low level gangster who begins the film's narration with a heartfelt, ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.""<br/><br/>But Henry's recollections are not meant to be trusted. He's so obsessed with ""gangsters"" that his romantic view of crime eventually becomes akin to Scorsese's own faith in both cinema and Catholicism. We watch as Hill devotes himself to the hoods above him, a criminal clergyman who worships at the altar of the Mafia's glamorous lifestyle. As a kid, he gazes longingly at the neighbourhood gangsters as if they were gods. To Hill, being a gangster is better than being the President. Being a low level mafia ""somebody"" is better than being a regular ""nobody schnook"". Of course, the irony is that Hill's Irish ancestry prevents him from ever climbing the Mafia ranks. He rises from alter boy to priest but is unable to climb any higher, stuck in the very ""blue collar"" life he deplores.<br/><br/>Released by Warner Brothers in 1990, ""Goodfellas"" follows the same ""rise and fall"" narrative progression as all the early Warner Brother ""machine gun operas"" of the 1920s and 30s. Films like ""Little Caesar"", ""The Public Enemy"" and ""Scarface"" all presented fairly simple critiques of crime, their first halves containing ""heroes"" who climb the ranks of the criminal underworld, crime aestheticized through the power of celluloid, whilst their second halves showed the ""hero's"" world collapsing inexorably around him. The message: crime is seductive but ultimately doesn't pay.<br/><br/>Scorsese disguises his simple narrative with a frenzied style that might be described as ""anecdotal"" or ""documentarian"", but it's the same tale. We, like Hill, are seduced by crime, by the sheer sexiness of Scorsese's technique, before being subjected to a long 30-minute tonguelashing in which Hill's life comes crashing down.<br/><br/>During this sequence, Scorsese revokes every technique he employed during the film's first two acts. Consider the way Scorsese shows us Hill's cocaine fuelled dash through the daily minutia of his life, the director's once lyrical long takes and smooth tunes now choppy, unsettling and paranoid. The point: Henry's life is a dream, a complete fabrication, the audience suckered into accepting the image-lie. Henry articulates this himself when he says he was ""living in a fantasy"", we the audience finally learning that our perception of mafia life is built upon artifice. Such a postmodern stance - ""Goodfellas"" is about the falsity of itself - is in many ways deeply pessimistic. The message isn't that ""crime isn't seductive"" so much as its ""crime is seductive only because it has never been truthfully rendered"". <br/><br/>The film ends with the image of a gangster firing his gun directly at the audience. This is a homage to ""The Great Train Robbery's"" final scene, which 90 years ago caused audiences to flinch in their seats with terror. Scorsese's choice of referencing this shot neatly encapsulates how cinema audiences are still captivated by the charisma and violence of the criminal. But the scene also has the unintentional effect of showing how impotent the gangster has become. Devoid of new ideas, the gangster genre requires escalating levels of violence, camera pyrotechnics and swearing to hook audiences. Simply pointing a gun no longer has an effect.<br/><br/>In ""Projections 1"", director John Boorman criticises ""Goodfellas"", writing: ""Marty's camera caresses them, celebrates them, dances attendance on them like the most sycophantic fan. This sets up an uneasy tension in the audience. When a movie is as well made as this, we are seduced. Our moral judgement collapses."" <br/><br/>But seduction is the very point. This is not a film about gangsters, this is a film about gangster films. It is a film about the seductiveness of technique. A TV series like ""The Sopranos"" would take this further, presenting gangsters who are so seduced by false images of themselves that they consciously act like the image. What this leads to is a continual distancing effect. We move further away from the ""truth"" of crime, instead getting increasingly hyper-mediated levels of ""fake"". What's problematic is that ""Goodfellas"" - which feigns sophistication by being upfront and ironic about its fakeness - always gets touted as a factual and authentic account of crime, when its actually got more in common with something like ""Pulp Fiction"", in that both films are relatively substanceless joyrides with a surfeit of style.<br/><br/>More interesting are the film's ""religious aspects"". Henry renounces his ideals and is promptly excommunicated from the mafia for heresy. For his sacrilege, the life he once worshipped so devoutly is taken away. The worship and devotion to something, the constant testing of one's faith and the inevitable disgrace that occurs when one cannot possibly live by an imposed morality any longer, are themes that permeate all of Scorsese's films. Harvey Keitel's ""faith in his brother"" in Mean Streets - a faith that is tested and then shattered - is very much the genesis of all these ideas.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – ""Goodfellas"" abounds with contradictions. It probes the fraudulent cinematic image of mob glitz whilst relying (""Funny like a clown? I'm here to amuse you?"") on the very traits it undermines. But really, the film represents the inability of the maverick directors of the 70s to push cinema any further; most simply sought comfort in nostalgia. Luckily today's new wave of modernist crime films (led by ""The Wire"") make an effort to map our increasingly complex world, which is why they are so murky and labyrinthine, compared to, say, the easily resolved conflicts of ""The Departed""."

I forced myself to see this movie in 4 stages just because It had a rating of 8.7. I couldn't sit and see it all at once. I know it is based on a true story, but it would have been much more exciting if the narrator dies at the end to break the monotony of the story line. Everything about the script was predictable. I raise my hat to Joe Pesci's performance and the exceptional skills of Martin Scorsese ...Other than that, I can't find a reason to give a rating higher than 6.

","I admit it; I'm an action movie guy. So a film about the mafia should be right up my alley. But I'm often turned off by dramas. It's not that I don't respect those who like fine art. I do. But personally, I lack the sophistication or training to appreciate the makeup or sets or choreography if the plot is awful and the characters unlikeable.<br/><br/>That's what gets in my way when I watch Goodfellas, which I've seen twice now but couldn't get through it the 2nd time. The protagonists are nasty and I couldn't identify with them. This is the same thing that turned me off watching ""Pulp Fiction"".<br/><br/>Superb acting, story, some real drama -- but how ugly and why would I want to watch this?<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- art types / drama lovers: a must-see<br/><br/>-- action movie types who don't mind when the protagonist is violent and awful<br/><br/>Sorry, but at least I've stated some real reasons for giving Goodfellas only a 4 out of 10."

","I was first introduced to Scorsese's work with 'Taxi Driver', and was immediately compelled to rush out and rent 'Mean Streets' and then Scorsese's first, 'Who's that Knockin'?' Although these films were both uneven in places, I still saw the same brilliance. So of course I had to rent 'Goodfellas', right? It is in everyone's top 100. And I was monumentally disappointed. There was no struggle with moral issues. These guys were just violent jerks for whom I had no sympathy. I *wanted* them to get caught so someone would get them off of the street (and off of my TV screen). Ray Liotta is such a pretty boy that he could never match DeNiro or Keitel in my book. And the violence in this movie was just sickening and unnecessary. Sorry, folks, disagree with me all you want, but I'm sorry I ever decided to watch 'Goodfellas' and I haven't felt compelled to pick up a Scorsese flick since."
"TheEmulator23","10","6","12","1 April 2008"," A perfect film.
","This has everything a movie should have. A great story, acting, cinematography, direction, (I will never understand how Scorsese did not win his 1st Oscar!) production values, I can go on and on. There is nothing that isn't done perfectly on this film. If this were to come out in any given year it would be considered a classic. I understand that there are the hardcore devotee's to The 1st two Godfather films, but to me (and many others) this is the quintessential gangster film. I used to watch this film over and over and I usually try and nitpick even some of of the all time great films, but there is nothing I can pick on in this film! I had kind of seen Scorsese films before and really liked most of them, (Taxi Driver, & Raging Bull especially) but ever since ""Goodfellas"" I would follow everything he did. I didn't follow the Oscars when I was a kid, but was shocked to learn this didn't win Best Picture however the fact that ""Dances with Wolves"" did was one of the few times I wish the Oscar should could have been shared. As much as I loved ""Wolves"" ""Goodfellas"" has held up as the better picture. If you haven't seen this film and consider your self a serious film afectiando you need to see this before you are laughed at by actual filmphiles."

","One of the best and funniest lines in an excellent movie.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is, in my opinion, one of the best movies Scorsese's ever made. It has such great momentum, both dramatically and visually. Ballhaus and Schoonmaker are really at the top of their game in this movie. Fantastic.<br/><br/>But it's all in the story. If you don't have it on paper, it doesn't matter how many cool camera angles or transitions you can come up with. The movie runs for almost two and a half hours, yet it never gets boring. It always manages to get, and keep, you interested. The script is perfect. I normally have sort of a problem with voice overs. As Brian Cox says in Adaptation: ""God help you if you use voice-over in your work, my friends. God help you. That's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character.""<br/><br/>But here it works wonders, it helps to propel the story along with the excellent soundtrack.<br/><br/>And the characters... The names alone... Jimmy Two Times, Johnny Roastbeef, Joe Buddha... Why don't we see people like Frank Cicero and Frank Vincent in more movies?<br/><br/>Not to mention Ray Liotta. I don't get why he isn't hired more often. Regardless how bad the movie is, he usually is able to make something interesting and/or funny out of his character. Take ""Copland"" or ""Hannibal"" or ""Heartbreakers"" or ""Blow"" or why not ""Narc""? Well, as always, there are exceptions. I wouldn't see ""Operation Dumbo Drop"" or ""Escape from Absolom"" again, even if my life depended on it...<br/><br/>Joe Pesci is... ...well, he's Joe Pesci in this movie. But I gotta hand it to him, no one can pull off a Joe Pesci like he can! He IS funny like a clown, and he DOES amuse me!<br/><br/>Robert De Niro's perfect as the laid back gangster Jimmy Conway who just explodes with fits of rage.<br/><br/>As I said, one of Scorsese's best. He's one of my all-time favourite directors, but I just wish he'd stop making cr*p like Gangs of New York. The Special Edition of Goodfellas is coming out on DVD in Europe this fall, and I'll be waiting first in line to replace my old version.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie with both a compelling story as well as great characters. Although I have to leave a little caveat, It IS violent."

","GOODFELLAS (1990) **** Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Mike Starr,  Michael Imperioli, Kevin Corrigan.  Martin Scorsese's blockbuster masterpiece look at the world of organized crime based on the true-life account of Henry Hill (excellently portrayed by Liotta) and his life lessons in the Mob.  Chilling and unflinchingly violent and funny (both thanks to a disturbing Pesci, Best Supporting Actor, as an out-of-control wiseguy). Brilliant direction and strong performances, as well as its nostalgic production values.  Memorable Steadicam shot of The Copacabana in New York and Pesci's ""I'm funny"" uneasy scene."

","Here's a contrarian opinion: GOODFELLAS is to be avoided unless you have a strong stomach and a proclivity towards sadism. A basically tawdry and sleazy story about a tawdry and sleazy bunch of mobsters is turned into a garish comic strip that is never quite funny enough to overcome the truly revolting violence, which is portrayed in as hideous a manner as possible. It might be argued that Scorsese is trying to make a moral point here, but it just doesn't wash. A truly repulsive film."
"markocricket-1","9","4","7","15 March 2008"," A great insight into mafia life.
","I recently watched Goodfellas.<br/><br/>This movie unlike The Godfather which shows the viewers and critics what mafia life is like higher up the ranks of mafia life. Goodfellas tells the viewers and critics what mafia life is like lower down the mafia food chain.<br/><br/>Goodfellas also gives the knowledge that murder and other serious crimes in mafia life happens a lot of the time. When Billy Batts is murdered by a rage of fury from Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci); and when Paulie (Paul Sorvino) asks Henry Hill (Ray Liotta)did he know what happened to Billy Batts. And Henry replies with numerous incidents. The power expressed in the this movie is an outstanding feature of the brilliance of a Martin Scorsese's directing. Example: When an innocent young man called ""Spider"" is killed by Tommy. Another feature of which I noticed of Martin Scorsese's directing is that he can place the middle of the movie. This skill is also shown in Casino. Not many directors can do that, but Scosese does it perfectly in both Casino and Goodfellas.<br/><br/>A sad part of mafia life is shown in Goodfellas, this is the fact that children such as : Henry Hill, Tommy and Jimmy ; when they are young can join the mafia.<br/><br/>This movie is basically a biography of Henry Hill that an innocent young school boy is falling deeper into mafia life. He ended up doing a prison sentence for his love of mafia life. Even at the end court scene he still loved the mafia life even thought he nearly got killed for it. Even to this generation of movies getting greedier of special effects. The modern generation can appreciate film such as Goodfellas."

Its iconic, slick, cool, over violent and sickening all screwed into one great movie. There's really nothing else that need be said about this film which is perhaps the greatest ever and in my opinion far superior to the great yet overrated godfather. It's just absolutely flawless, and if pushed to find one i'd say its the fact that the budget isn't large enough"
"lashawill","1","22","62","19 December 2012"," Predictable story of an average gangster
","At a most general level the movie is about a dilemma of an average gangster. At certain point in his career if things go wrong, an average mobster faces a dilemma. A dilemma of becoming either a 'rat' or a 'martyr'.<br/><br/>At the story level the most of the characters are all too 'rationalistic', in the sense that most of the time they are doing whatever they got to do to stay fit and survive. Probably the only exception is Tommy DeVito, whose overcompensating, psychotic aggression makes him the only interesting character. However, even in his case, the all too 'rationalistic' social milieu makes his fate far to predictable. Everybody except Tommy know the rules and know the limits. There are rules to rob, rules to kill, rules to betray and rules to go to jail. Tommy is the only person that challenges the order.<br/><br/>Overall, contrary to romantic stereotypes, the portrayal of mafia world gives a picture of strict subordination and 'law-abidingness'. The story gives the picture of the mafia world that is exactly the opposite of what the narrator's childhood memories describe. What seemed to be the world of the free, daring and interesting, strong men, appears as a world of socially conditioned, 'rationalistic' and predictable world of predator mammals, who do whatever their dominant cultural environment permits or commands them to do."
"heero_yuy2","5","9","21","20 August 2005"," somehow unoriginal
","Well everyone's telling it and I hadn't tried it once, not even in cable. So here's my two cents worth of it.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta plays an Italian-Irish boy obsessed with becoming a gangster. While seemingly getting close to a certain ""main man"" in the streets, his dreams suddenly became a reality, getting friends with two gangsters, all the money, a wife and kids, even girls, fame and fortune, all that he wanted to be...until things gone haywire.<br/><br/>I know Scorcese is a great director, but this movie seemed like a Raging Bull reunion with Pesci and De Niro, not to mention De Niro being worn out as a Mafia/local gangster in his role, and Pesci uncontrollable in his role that I can't seem to understand he began and end up that way. If I was a gangster, I never would had liked that guy to be met in the first place...and how did Liotta get close to him? The cinematography is too much pizazz by the 90's edge that it end up being boring in, like, more than 2 hours of it (the way Scorcese make his movies these days). Too complicated idea that Liotta's role end up seeking witness protection against his ""friends"". The only thing I was impressed is Paul Sorvino's role.<br/><br/>I think Scorcese is starting to diminish his quality movie-making and style with this movie, focusing more on popularity of stars and movie length rather than a stylish, good story movie. I had much fun better watching Taxi Driver, King Of Comedy, Last Temptation of Christ, and my favorite, Raging Bull. I'm sorry for the negative criticisms on this famous movie, but that's how I see it in an unbiased way. Although Pileggi initially wrote the novel good, he edited it with boggleness for the movie, which, err, hadn't got better."

","Martin Scorsese-directed modern-day mobster drama adapted from Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"" by Scorsese and Pileggi involves Brooklyn youth in 1955 who gets drawn into the gangster lifestyle, first as their gopher, later as a major player. Joe Pesci is frightening as a psychotic ball-buster and won a Supporting Actor Oscar, yet Ray Liotta is even better in the central role, and Lorraine Bracco is excellent as Liotta's wife. Exceptionally well-made film is gratuitous in its usage of a certain expletive and cannot overcome one major obstacle: despite its attempts to show the ugliness of Mafia life, the movie is constantly undermined by a distinct romanticism of its own violence. The infrequent narration by both Liotta and Bracco is a distraction, as we are often being told exactly what we're seeing on the screen, but the creeping paranoia is palpable and the drama played out is disturbing and gripping. **1/2 from ****"

","Who would you call a nice guy? Probably a work colleague who, to the detriment of his time, agrees to drink a glass of beer with you and listen to crazy talk about lost love. And after the third glass of beer it becomes clearly clear to you that this is, in general, a nice guy. The heroes of this film will not negotiate with you, will not show understanding, and if you owe something to these people, then death becomes not the worst way out of this situation. This is a film about the life of the mafia .<br/><br/>Even when Henry was in school, he saw how simple it all goes to people from the "" family "". They robbed, cheated and even killed people, but their opinions did not change. They were afraid, and therefore - respected. They were not afraid of anyone and they had good reason. Naturally, young Henry was struck by such a life, and in his heart he had long since matured in order to start his own criminal career and, finally, to become a real gangster. And this story is dedicated to his ascent, his victories and his collapse.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the events of the film occur predominantly in the 70s of the last century, this picture makes us recall our nostalgic memories of the unforgettable computer game "" Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven "", where events took place in the 30s. In addition to the general atmosphere in these works of art, some scenes from the film frankly migrated to the screens of computer monitors. Remarkable is the fact that the protagonist of the film - Ray Liotta was subsequently involved in the sound of Tommy Angelo - the main character of the already mentioned game.<br/><br/>According to many sites that are directly related to the field of cinema, and some film magazines, "" Glorious guys "" - this is the most realistic film about the mafia ever created. In this aspect, it is difficult for me not to agree with them, when scenes of beatings, which the Godfather trilogy and the painting Once Upon a Time in America often neglected, are often swept across the frame. Martin Scorsese took the story based on real events, reworked it into a script, and created from it not a banal tale about the mafia, but a hard interesting film that is worth watching several times.<br/><br/>Henry . The protagonist of the film, through whose eyes we see everything that happens in the film. His character performed by Ray Liotta is laconic and not too emotional. But this does not mean that he is boring. His acting potential is revealed closer to the second half of the film, when Henry's life begins to lose its former stability, and now he has to really survive in order to stay afloat.<br/><br/>Jimmy I have already seen so many films with the participation of Robert De Niro that it would seem there is nothing surprising. This actor perfectly showed a variety of images, from comedies to strong dramas. And yet, Robert is surprised. He is fully revealed in the film. His character is a gangster with experience, who has engaged himself in all areas of the criminal life of society. His preference is robbery, however, if necessary, he is capable of anything, including murder.<br/><br/>Tommy . The brightest character in this movie. In all likelihood, this is the best role played by Joe Pesci . Here he was given a real revelation, which cannot be said about such paintings as "" Home Alone "" or "" Deadly Weapon "". His character is small, obviously with a chronic neurosis, a gangster, with a complex youthful fate, who is very proud of what he has achieved. He does not allow anyone to insult himself, while he will allow himself clearly more than acceptable, at any convenient occasion grabbing a knife or a gun. It is necessary to mention that this is also a very talkative, and therefore very funny character. Honored Oscar for Best Supporting Role.<br/><br/>The director of the film, Martin Scorsese , the author of such masterpiece films like Gangs of New York and the Oscar-winning ""The Departed, "" created a film that perfectly complements Godfather , telling the most tough and interesting story about the life of the mafia. I recommend viewing this film to anyone who likes masterpieces, to all sincere cinema fans, since this is a really interesting film, which doesn't need a half-hour buildup at a time of two and a half hours. The film clings from the first minutes and releases at the moment when the final credits are on the screen.<br/><br/>Watch it ..."
"Marian20","10","3","5","7 September 2017"," The Truth About The Mob Particularly Its Decline
","Robert De Niro,Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci together with Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino star in this arguably greatest film about the mob - with respects to The Godfather saga particularly the first part - in this Martin Scorsese film based on the book written by Nicholas Pillegi's bestselling book ""Wise Guy"" known as ""Goodfellas"". <br/><br/>It details the story of mob informant Henry Hill,portrayed by Liotta, about his twenty-five year life in the mob from 1955 when he was 12 years old until 1980 when he cooperated with the FBI that put his fellow mobsters into jail particularly Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway,portrayed by De Niro; and mob underboss Paul Cicero,portrayed by Sorvino.It details into Hill's criminal life that he is involved in like extortion,robbery,hijacking and murder. It also provides the viewer the benefits that entails being part of the mob like the amount of money they are able to earn and the ability to be given special treatment particularly not going in line at Copacabana as well as the respect they achieve from the people in the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Many film viewers in the past have accused of The Godfather of glamorizing mobsters particularly the mafia Dons like Don Vito Corleone and his successor Michael Corleone particularly the first part.While I certainly do not agree with the critics considering that the movie has shown how mob life can destroy one's family as shown in the movie,Scorsese made it a point for viewers to see clearly in this film how disastrous mob life is all about. It really has shown the crimes that they are involved with as well as the fear and anxiety these people constantly feel considering their way of life wherein crimes and murdering people are a parts of their daily life. It has also shown how much it lost its appeal particularly during its decline in the 1980's when the FBI intensified its commitment of putting people involved in organized crime behind bars.We get to see how the main characters ended up getting murdered like Tommy DeVito,portrayed by Pesci in his Oscar winning performance or how they spent the rest of their life in jail just like Cicero and Conway; and how fellow members of the mob made deals with the FBI like Hill in order to corroborate against their fellow mobsters or friends in the crimes that they are involved in and enter a Witness Protection Program to protect them from the mob.<br/><br/>After watching this film since its release 27 years ago while this review is written,I must say that it really could be considered the best film about the mob as it is based on a true story and a true account of mob life particularly the so-called foot soldiers a.k.a wise guys or better yet goodfellas who does hits for the mob instead of a fictional account about Dons or leaders of organized crime families in The Godfather saga.It also provides us how truly unappealing this way of life is especially now that the mob no longer provides that much impact in society and the advancement of technology that have benefited the FBI in terms of investigation of mobsters and the deals or programs that mobsters get into whenever they help the FBI in bringing down organized crimes.This film makes it clear in that regard unlike The Godfather saga considering that the mob are still in their glory years during the settings of the three part movies during the 50's,60's and 70's unlike this movie when it was released in 1990.<br/><br/>Overall,Goodfellas shows that truth about the mob,its way of life, and its decline from the time it was released until the present time."

"bkoganbing","9","3","5","15 February 2007"," The Criminal Mindset
","The gangster film has been redefined so many times in cinema history it will be interesting to see how it is redefined once again. Goodfellas is a milestone film in that regard because just as Public Enemy and Little Caesar defined it in the Thirties, The Godfather trilogy in the seventies and eighties, Goodfellas set the standard that all other films including Martin Scorsese similar Casino try to meet. The interesting thing is that Martin Scorsese is young enough to redefine it again with another work.<br/><br/>With Ray Liotta narrating his own life in crime in a flashback as real life criminal Henry Hill, Martin Scorsese offers us one fascinating glimpse of the criminal life in the Eisenhower to Reagan era. Henry Hill even as a child got sucked into the criminal life as a kid, as he said all he ever wanted to be was a gangster. Tutored by both Robert DeNiro and Paul Sorvino, Liotta takes part in one of the biggest heists of all time of Lufthansa Airlines at JFK Airport during the seventies. Goodfellas is the story of the events from Henry Hill's perspective leading up to the heist and the aftermath.<br/><br/>For myself I've never seen the gangster mentality better expressed on screen except maybe by Sean Connery in Family Business. Liotta and Connery operate from the same mindset. If you work hard and hope it pays off in success, you're a dope. If you want something, just take it. When you come right down to it, that's how criminals think, it's the rest of us who are fools.<br/><br/>Goodfellas was nominated for several Oscars, but came away with only one winner, Joe Pesci in the role of crazy Tommy DeVito. He's another criminal type, one who's driven by a terrible inferiority complex due to his short stature and does terrible things even to his own peers. And those peers don't forget as you see what happens to Pesci in Goodfellas. This turned out to be a career role for Pesci. He's a multi-talented man who's got an incredible range and can play everything from the Home Alone comedies to stone killers like here in Goodfellas or in Casino.<br/><br/>There's usually a contest in which Scorsese fans argue whether Casino or Goodfellas is better. I happen to like Casino, but without the success of Goodfellas, Casino would not have been made.<br/><br/>For a fascinating look at the criminal mindset, Goodfellas is an absolute must."
"lal-olse","10","3","5","9 November 2006"," why the movie Goodfellas is a excellent use of time
","Hey all movie lovers out there. This is my first visit on IMDb and I like what I see. Iam a big fan of almost every movie genre there is, you just cant say that one type of genre are all bad. Keep a open mind. But of course there are good and lesser good movies . Goodfellas are one of the best gangster/mafia films ever made, you got the best actors ,like Joe Pesci ,Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. Ray did his best performance ever. For me this movie just have a very mafia is feeling surrounding the hole story. And we can all give Martin Scorsese the full honor for that . Like in many other films. Eks.Casino. In Goodfellas you have a lot of scenes that are so well played, you can see the camera standing on one place all trough a scene,filming three or four guys and still the realness don't disappear for one sec. They make us believe it. That is damn good acting. So if you don't think Goodfellas is a movie worth seeing, take a closer look. Leon Ya"
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","3","5","6 May 2006"," A masterpiece (spoilers)
","The opening to Goodfellas  the murder of Billy Batts  shows the beginning of the end of Henry Hill. Up until that point, despite the thieving and the violence, everything is rather light-hearted. There's a sense of solidarity amongst the criminals. But once Batts is murdered, infighting, greed and addiction take over. The life will get you in the end.<br/><br/>But the opening scenes are great at establishing the allure of being a gangster. After all, as the movies have always shown, it's a very seductive world. I mean, who wouldn't want to be able to thumb their nose in the face of the law if they could get away with it? Therefore it's totally right that the film shows you all the fun aspects of this criminal life. And at the beginning the camera focuses on all the accoutrements of gangsterism  jewellery, shoes, cars etc. They're almost like movie stars.<br/><br/>And at the beginning the violence is even intended to seduce you. There's a great bit where Henry's postman is threatened with an oven to make sure he doesn't give any school letters to Henry's parents. The way it's shot and scored makes it seem like something of a lark. You're asked to acknowledge and respect the power and audacity of these guys. And the icing on the cake is the final-freeze frame of the terrified postman's face  these guys control life and death; if you don't respect them you're going in the oven.<br/><br/>But freeze-frames occur frequently in the early part of the film. There's a powerful shot where Henry's dad is beating him with a belt and it's stopped right in the middle of the whipping. It makes the beating seem even more violent than it already is and it makes you understand and identify with Henry's rebellion; soon no one will be able to do that to him again. However, the most famous freeze-frame in the film is when Henry sets the cars on fire. The image is held as Henry makes a Christ-like pose with flames behind him  he's finally in the life; welcome to hell.<br/><br/>And another early scene I like is when the young Henry gets pinched. He thinks the guys will be mad at him for getting caught, but because he keeps his mouth shut he's welcomed from the court like a conquering hero. And the scene even ends with another freeze-frame. It might as well be a family portrait.<br/><br/>But the good times extend into Henry's adult life. He steals trucks, makes lots of money and even falls in love. And this leads to another great scene  the long Steadicam shot when Henry takes Karen to the Copacabana. This is her seduction. This is when she is seduced by the life. And another seduction is the scene where Henry pummels one of Karen's neighbours. He's supposed to have touched Karen so Henry rearranges his face with the butt of his gun. But although it's incredibly violent and although the sound effects make you wince, you can see why Karen would be turned on. How many other men would do this for her? How many other men would protect her in such a brutal way? Not many.<br/><br/>However, like I said at the beginning, Billy Batts is when everything begins to go downhill. From that point on the murders become more frequent and collective greed is overtaken by personal greed. But I do have to say that the Batts murder is my favourite scene. The dialogue and the timing between Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent is outstanding and the beating has so much emotion. You kind of get whipped up in it yourself. You can feel what it must be like to get your on back on someone you hate. And the choice of music ('Atlantis' by Donovan) is perfect. It raises the scene to another level.<br/><br/>But Scorsese's choice of music is always spot-on. The other musical highlight has to be his use of the closing music in 'Layla'. It's a beautiful piece, which makes it work well with the grisly murders it shows  the images kind of show an end of an era, which, what with the music, lends the whole sequence a strange kind of romanticism. And it also works well because the emotion of the song and the final piece of music go hand in hand with what Jimmy (De Niro) is feeling at the time  the song and the music is about yearning for someone and then having that love fulfilled, and Jimmy is beside himself with pleasure that Tommy (Pesci) is being made. He thinks his dreams are finally coming true.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, though, that sequence is when the real nightmare kicks in. After this, Henry becomes an addict and screws up so bad that he has to betray his friends. And the sequence that shows the day of his arrest is rather amazing. Again Scorsese proves himself to be a master of using music to emphasise emotion and mood, and it's shot in such a way with zooms and fast edits that you feel as strung out as Henry. It's coke film-makingbut in a good way.<br/><br/>And I also like the final scene between Jimmy and Karen. With smiles and promises he tries to whack her, but she gets scared and manages to get away. It's a good way of showing what's wrong with this life without moralising  in this life you can never truly trust your friends; and who really wants to live like that? <br/><br/>But at the end, despite everything, you also get to see that Henry misses his life. And although it's supremely arrogant of him to say that he gets to live the rest of his life like a schnook, you sort of know what he means. If only he and his pals weren't so damn greedy they would have had it made."
"rockybalboa2430","10","3","5","28 June 2005"," how can a masterpiece be underrated? here's how...
","Goodfellas is one of the top movies in the history of cinema, nominated for best picture (and five other Oscars) considered by many the top movie of the 90s, so how can it be underrated.<br/><br/>put simply, it is underrated because the Godfather (parts I and II) are so brilliant. The sad thing is that, because Goodfellas is a gangster movie, it will always be compared to other gangster movies. for some reason, movies in that genre (gangster/organized crime) are never looked at as individual pictures, but are forever compared and put up against other gangster films. The only exception to this rule, is the godfather of all gangster movies, the Godfather. this is probably because it is the first of its kind (not the first gangster movie, but the first modern-style gangster movie), most gangster movies made after the Godfather are complete rip offs of the Godfather, but every once in a while a movie like Goodfellas comes along that may be similar to on the surface, but is then written off by many. when I say, written off, I mean that it is not getting the credit it deserves. it is a masterpiece, yes it is a gangster picture, no it is not the Godfather. Many people admire it for what it is, but if the Godfather hadn't been made, or even if this film wasn't always compared to it, it would take its deserved place in cinema history. that place is not as a good film, and a great gangster film, it is a artful, entertaining, and near flawless film, and one of the top two greatest gangster films."
"JLeckie","10","3","5","4 September 1998"," The highlight of Scorcese's career and the film of the decade.
","Probably the finest film of the past decade, Goodfellas has all the ingredients of a perfect movie. An excellent script, a soundtrack which is as memorable as the film itself and unforgettable character acting - especially by De Niro and Pesci. Scorcese makes the world of the 'Wiseguy' as appealing and exciting as Francis Ford Coppola did in his Godfather masterpieces, with the added bonus of rapid fire dialogues. Whereas one may remember single lines from The Godfather, any fan of Goodfellas would be able to recite entire conversations, such as the 'What am I, a clown?'... A perfect movie."

","The movie showcases deniro and liotta at their best, with pesci acting in his usual gangster role. However the film is too long, without a tight plot for support. hence after watching for two hours, one starts wondering when the film is going to get over. while the film has some very funny and quite believable scenes, it ends up being another one of scorcese's film glamorising gangsterhood."
"stimpco","4","10","27","24 November 2002"," Flat, boring, simplistic movie.
","Thought I should finally see this movie last year because it is one of those movies ""you have to see"".  Cinematography notwithstanding, I found little to draw me into the film.  I want to say that it has been dated, or perhaps too often imitated, but having just rewatched The Godfather I see what a good mafia movie should be.  In a nutshell, the violence was expected, the dialogue was simplistic, and the plot went nowhere fast.  I fought to stay awake awaiting a huge climax that never happened.  But that is only my opinion, and a lot of people seem to like it, so judge for yourself."
"stephen7272","5","4","8","11 April 2013"," Great characters, but no message
","Goodfellas is a joy to watch. Joe Pesci is in his comfort zone playing a tetchy little New York Mafiosa hard man. De Niro almost takes a backseat to Pesci. Liotta, as raconteur, delivers the story pitch perfect.<br/><br/>So why only 5 out of 10 (""bing a bang"")?<br/><br/>The characterisations are marvellous but the message is an empty bag. The message is merely that ""might is right"" and life is short. The bigger you are, the more friends you have, the more weight you can throw around. Well, we know that. We knew that when a nuke was dropped on Hiroshima.<br/><br/>There is no sincere message from the movie. There are plenty of lovable characters but nothing else to feed us. You get more, much more, from Allen's Broadway Danny Rose. From the Godfather you learn about the organisation of the underworld.<br/><br/>However, they say movies are more about character than plot. Maybe that applies to the message too. It's good. It's fun. But you don't learn anything from it other than a few syllables that every other kid at college would know. In Goodfellas, life is so simple it's makes me wonder why I bother to pay my bills."
"wisewebwoman","8","4","8","17 February 2008"," One of Scorcese's Masterpieces
","'Goodfellas' is right up there with the best of Martin Scorcese. I recently hauled this out for a re-viewing and I was surprised at how totally up to date it felt. How relevant the plot was, how topical the story.<br/><br/>And for a mafia movie of that era, how the women were brought front and centre and given a narrative voice - Karen Hill (played by Lorraine Bracco), the wife of the protagonist, Henry Hill (played by a riveting Ray Liotta) both get to tell their stories.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a true story and the cast are awesome. At this later viewing I was particularly interested to see many of ""The Sopranos"" cast, here making their debuts in a similar crime-family drama.<br/><br/>The movie is astounding in that it brings complexity, a riveting script, brilliant relevant music (with actual stars performing their hits) and mind boggling tracking shots, the most difficult of all movie sequencing. Scorcese, or his ensemble, do not flinch from the complexity of this and afterwards, one wonders at how many takes were involved.<br/><br/>We are drawn into the intimate life of a crime family, the gradual desensitizing to the horror of the life, driven by material greed at any cost, including the callous snuffing of lives.<br/><br/>The large ensemble cast (both known and unknown and including both of Scorcese's parents in brilliant sidebits), the cinematography, editing and dialogue are all masterful.<br/><br/>De Niro is at his charming best,Joe Pesci captivates as a psychotic, insecure 'made' man Lorraine Bracco is masterful in a fully developed role, Ray Liotta is marvellous in the way he depicts the reality of the hoodlum life, the juxta-positioning of sauce making against the back drop of victim burials. Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas and Kevin Corrigan all add to the over all engrossing engagement of the film.<br/><br/>8 out of 10. Not to be missed."
"rajdoctor","7","4","8","4 August 2007"," Goodfellas
","I have been looking at the top 100 movies list of IMDb and it is becoming so disappointing. The top 6 movies are of crime, murder, action and mafia. Casablanca is the only movie that is of its own category standing out alone at 7th place; but this time I at looking at GoodFellas at spot 17 - all time great movies.<br/><br/>The story is based on true events and characters from a novel named ""Wise Guy"" written by crime reporter Nicholos Pileggi. It is about this boy Henry Hill born (Ray Liotta) in 1943 in a poor working class family who wanted to be in a gang since his boyhood because that gave him freedom, money, and respect from people. He joins hands with Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). This trio starts by hijacking, stealing and selling goods from huge truck loads. Once arrested Hill starts dealing in drugs in prison and when out continues to do so. In the end, with difficult times, of police after him, with new enemies and having difficult times with his wife Karen (Lorriane Bracco)  he decides to be an informant to avoid prison sentence and gives in most of his gangster friends  good fellows! The movie is directed by Martin Scorsese, who like Tarantino has earned his reputation with cold blooded killing of people and mafia movies. He directs the movie well in all departments and combines with ample social, family and drama scenes to balance the dark narrative.<br/><br/>All the actors have acted well, but the best in the lot is Joe Pesci who has played the weird cranky character of Tommy with such conviction that it should be remembered just for its sheer portrayal of characteristics. Ray Liotta who gets to play the central character is okay and his career till date shows that he has lost himself into mundane small roles. Robert De Niro is as good as ever and shows his brilliant insight to understanding deep dark characters  he loves to play.<br/><br/>The movie progresses from 1950 till 1980s and Martin captures all those eras with much ease and details.<br/><br/>Even though his movie is in the top 20 list - lately, seeing many of these mafia movies  I do not feel that much excited. It has become routine and mundane for me to watch the cold killings, glorifying killings, blood everywhere  showing crazy characters who pull out gun at any point to shoot someone. I feel sick at times for the world and the good directors who have not got over showing it on big screen.<br/><br/>Just a trivia, Henry Hill is still alive but suffering depression and fighting alcoholism and spends most of his time in rehab centers.<br/><br/>(Stars 7 out of 10)"

It was too slow in some parts and it seemed the movie had no sense of direction in some parts, which made me uninterested. <br/><br/>Joe Pesci, got under my thick skin, which proves how well he lived this character. He wasn't acting. Some of his scenes I will never forget. Liotta also proved to me he is an actor of high caliber. It was also interesting to see De Niro in a supporting role than the lead. <br/><br/>I think this movie is tad-bit overrated, especially for its direction.

Supported by great characters portrayed perfectly by Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco and the star of the piece Joe Pesci; this movie simply overflows with style, talent and guts.<br/><br/>It's incredibly violent and it's brimming with vulgar language, but every bit of it is warranted as a piece of the picture. Now i am the first to admit that i am not a big fan of gangster movies, but i cannot fail to appreciate the magnificence of this excellent film.<br/><br/>It's better than Casino (7/10) and it makes the godfather (6/10) look tame by comparison.<br/><br/>Goodfellas (9/10) and its genuinely worth it"
"Bevan - #4","5","5","11","20 October 2015"," Just plain overrated
","Chalk me up as another reviewer who found this movie to be vastly overrated. My wife and I saw it a couple nights ago, for the first time, and it just pales in comparison to cinematic triumphs such as The Godfather movies or The Sopranos.<br/><br/>As much as anything else, there are no likable characters. Part of the reason you could keep turning in to The Sopranos is that you could genuinely like and identify with the principals, despite their brutality and crimes. Here, you can't. None of the principals have any displayed virtues: at best, they're shallow and two-dimensional.<br/><br/>Yes, the highly lauded soundtrack has many tunes. But if you're going to use the hoary old tactic of advancing pop tunes down the years to denote the march of time, could you not be so flamingly anachronistic as all of that? They were playing 40s tunes in the doo-wop era, 50s doo-wop post-British Invasion, 60s psychedelic pop in the 70s, and early Eric Clapton in the disco era. Get the freaking DATES right.<br/><br/>Speaking of anachronisms, the film's jammed with them, and while it's superficially a glittering, gritty portrait of the wiseguy life and the wiseguy era, the goofs just overload. Cars too late for the year. Phones too late for the year. Livery too late for the year. Did Scorsese bother at all with accuracy and continuity, or did they just say ""Eh, get an old looking car out there."" It pains me to read about how exacting and painstaking DeNiro was to get every aspect of Jimmy's personality true to life, exactly how the real Jimmy Burke did, in the middle of a blizzard of anachronisms.<br/><br/>Most damning, there's just no dramatic tension. There's little by way of plot, little by way of suspense. The actors did good jobs with the material and direction they were given, but that's not remotely enough to sustain this seriously overrated flick.<br/><br/>5/10."

I basically kept watching to see if anything cool would happen last minute or something.<br/><br/>Not impressive at all, I am actually surprised it was on the list.

","Another in a series of movies from my list of shame that I'm catching up on. I'd never seen this, but knew some of the famous lines, which is no surprise given the popularity and high status this movie has.<br/><br/>Sadly, I grew up knowing Pesci from Home Alone and Gone Fishin' and My Cousin Vinny. I never caught him in these career defining roles. The man is terrifying with the intensity he brings. De Niro I knew from Meet the Parents and Stardust, I never got to experience the powerhouse performances. Ray Liotta.. I've seen him in stuff but he never made much impression on me. Aside from the big three, everyone in this is solid, there's no bad performances bringing it down.<br/><br/>Sadly, I think this suffers because I've seen other gangster movies. This feels sooooo much like every other mob movie. A lower grade Godfather, a less stylish Pulp Fiction, not as epic as The Irishman, and not as The Departed, it doesn't even explore the taxing nature of these lives as well Donnie Brasco. Almost all of these follow a young man coming up in the mob, loving it at first and then suffering for it.<br/><br/>What Goodfellas has gong for it is a collection of exceptional moments. The overall movie may feel oddly derivative to me but there's no doubt that some scenes are exceptional. It's definitely an odd experience because I know this predates almost all of those but that's not been my experience and it definitely suffers in my eyes because of it."

"scyyoung","10","2","3","5 June 2017"," The best Mob movie ever made.
","GoodFellas gets a 5/5 which does this film justice due to the amount of unique film techniques utilized by Martin Scorsese and the length of the movie that never seems to stagnant. The film manages to cover a two and a half decade timeline with the additions of narratives from two of the films main characters to pace the film correctly and fill in details that would've been impossible to inform us in 146 minutes or cover a 25 year timeline, which is integral when documenting a story of a character from childhood to manhood while including other aspects of his life.<br/><br/>Narration/Voiceovers played an integral part in GoodFellas because this enables Scorsese to give us ample information in a short period of time, which is essential to keep up with the films 25 year span or else the movie would have to be much longer or we'd miss out on crucial details that drive the film. Continuing, the film revolves around Henry but it is crucial to know and understand what he's into and who his friends or the people he hangs around really are which would've been impossible without the narrative. Fortunately for the audience Henry is a reliable narrator so we don't have to question what he is saying because no one can tell one's story better them they can, this also adds the ability to add opinion without them being wrong because they're his own opinions.Next the narrative makes the audience gravitate towards Henry and helps the audience to understand his ways and see him in a better light and not have to make our own assumptions about Henry whereas we see him as a hero rather than an anti hero, With Henry explaining his ways it helps us look past his greed, drug abuse, and cheating because him explaining himself is almost like an apology or friend telling you why they do the things they do. Lastly The dual perspective also adds a flavor not many narratives add which is a female perspective in parallel to the main character.<br/><br/>Furthermore the camera techniques used in this film are very different than an average cinematographers go to techniques. With the use of long cuts, freehand shots, and following movement during scenes this creates a genuine feeling and makes the film unbelievable realistic and intense. For example one of the most important scenes in the film from a cinematographic aspect is the restaurant scene when Henry and Karen walk from the street outside through a tunnel and walk through a kitchen into the restaurant and sit down all in one take and no cuts. Everything in the scene seems to flow fluidly and perfectly in cohesion with the two stars. The following of the character(s) by the camera adds a 3rd person spectating perspective that indulges you into the film and makes some seemingly pointless scenes interesting.<br/><br/>In conclusion GoodFellas is a tremendous film directed by Martin Scorsese that utilizes many film techniques not used together often and creates a seemingly effortless environment while also being realistic to the audience. The theme of the film is surrounded in tragedy and misfortune. While we see Henry's rise in power within the mob, we inevitably see his fall towards the second half of the movie. With money,power, and greed even the mightiest may fall which is what we see scattered throughout the later half of the film."
"crendine","7","2","3","1 April 2015"," ""Good But Not Great"" Fellas
","I realize that in many circles, this film is considered an absolute classic and possibly Scorsese's greatest. However, over the course of time, my perception of this film has changed. Having read ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi, I realized that this movie does not conform to the book all that much and tends to stray a great deal. While most of the performances are memorable, they don't really resemble the actual characters that the story is based on. Joe Pesci's performance seems way over the top to me although certain short scenes of his are hilarious. Overall, I'd say his performance was overacted. DeNiro, Frank Vincent, Lorraine Bracco, and Ray Liotta turn in very convincing performances and Scorsese's approach to this film was very unique and well done. One of the many overlooked features of this movie is the soundtrack. While not quite chronologically correct in some spots, it does tend to emphasize certain scenes. My major criticism of this film is that way too much time in the second half is devoted to Henry's drug problem. I felt that this segment of his life could have been summed up in one or possibly two scenes. But here, almost the entire second half of this movie focuses on Henry's drug addiction and dealing. Not necessary. Another criticism is that the famous ""Lufthansa heist"" is only mentioned here and not shown at all. I believe that this, above all, was the centerpiece in the lives of Jimmy Burke and Henry Hill and is not given enough attention. I would have preferred to see more detail about the heist and less about Henry's drug use. Other than that, it's a memorable film and worthy of a few viewings. But as an all-time classic, I don't think so."

","A fine tribal study of modern gangsterism in New York City. There are one or two allusions to being a ""made man"" but the words ""Mafia"" and ""Cosa Nostra"" never appear, though all the main figures are Italian, observe Italian moral codes, and occasionally lapse into the language of the Old Country. If you really want to be a member of the Goodfellas, it's not enough to be simply part Italian. You need to be ALL Italian, with traceable ancestry to the motherland, preferably Sicily.<br/><br/>Everyone except some Federal Agents are corrupt. The wives know what's going on and are often complicit, though they have little to say about business decisions. They're satisfied with the solidarity of the larger family, the special parking places, the secret entrances to the Copacabana, the respect shown themselves and their well-groomed husbands, and the general opulence of their life styles. The girl friends enjoy many of the same privileges but are mainly the subject of jokes, which wives and children are not. Well, some are Madonnas and some are whores.<br/><br/>The cops are partners in crime, whether the gangsters are on the streets or in prison. They become your major domos for a few cartons of cigarettes and an occasional big bill tucked into a shirt pocket. Your first jail term turns into a rite of passage, and you're given a celebration before you're packed off. The men clap and cry out ""Your cherry is broke now."" Prison itself is not a bad place if you're a wise guy. No one would dream of trying to rape you. You live with friends and share elaborate dinners and good wines with them.<br/><br/>There are only two problems; one is interactional, the other moral and economic.<br/><br/>As for the interactional problem, you can never really tell whether someone will become a ""rat,"" not even if you've known him all your life. From the point of view of a protagonist like Henry Hill, whose story this is, it's very bad to be a rat instead of a stand-up guy. On the other hand, it's much better to be a rat instead of a dead guy. Severe beatings are common, even for men who are no more than irritating or even for innocents like mailmen. And when an important deal is at stake, whacking is necessary.<br/><br/>Whacking is also applied to men who unwisely insult others, because this is a culture of honor. It's like the Old West without Wyatt Earp. ""When you call me that, smile."" And sometimes smiling isn't enough. The derision must be clearly couched. Half a couch may not do. Personal affronts call for a passionate butchery, but business transactions are cold blooded and maximally effective.<br/><br/>This social system is real enough. In certain bars in New York and New Jersey I was unwise enough to make some joke about Mafia hangouts and received warnings. And in Little Charlie's Restaurant on Kenmare Street in Little Italy, two tables were always kept empty in case some local businessmen decided to drop in unannounced.<br/><br/>The movie is told from Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta's) point of view and he narrates most of it. Hill was half Irish and married a Jewish girl but was accepted, within certain limitations. That brings up the moral questions built into the film. These guys are friendly and generous to each other. But who pay for all that reckless spending? You and I. The gang isn't a charitable organization. Every time we buy something or rent an apartment, it costs a little more because of them, and they contribute nothing except mutual support.<br/><br/>It's an immoral subculture in which the goals of society -- respect, wealth, material satisfaction, friendship -- are accepted, but society's means of achieving those goals -- following the rules, upholding the law, respecting the rights of strangers -- are rejected. The sociologist Robert K. Merton called them ""innovators"" and that's what they are. They invent and follow illegal rules for achieving society's goals. From an ethical perspective, it's a much better story than Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" series, which was an apologia for the Mafia, portrayed as a neighborhood organization that simply fills certain control functions that the regular police will or can not. No one was killed in ""The Godfather"" unless he was a coward and a traitor and deserved it. In ""Goodfellas"", a kid gets shot through the foot for being slow in delivering drinks to a table, and the incident is treated as a stupid joke. No one even TRIES justifying the act. When the same kid is later slaughtered for a resentful remark, the dead body is treated as a nuisance.<br/><br/>The acting is unimpeachable, and so is the production design. You can almost smell the cigars, the perfume, the marinara sauce cooking in the large pot on the stove. (Everybody eats a lot in this movie.) You should definitely see it if you haven't already. It's naturalism is convincing and there is no Marlon Brando to sympathize with."

","Spectacular. A well made feast of thirty years in the mafia. I usually think there's no such thing as a ten out of ten but this is an exception. I could not believe how well made this film. Martin Scorsesie uses the camera throughout the film like a genius. Joe Pesci plays an excellent performance as Tommy the loose cannoned killer. Robert DeNiro plays the Jimmy and it remains one of the best performances of his life but the performance of the film for realism belongs to Ray Liotta as Henry, the kid who started in the mafia as a young child and morphed into a middle aged coke head. This film is through the eyes of him in the mob for three decades observing every death, deal and wise guy in the deck. The how am I funny stuff is just classic, the spider fall is photographed brilliantly, and the narration is excellent. This film like none other, one that breaks rules by almost parodying the mob, This film is GOODFELLAS"

","I love the way this film is shot, it looks like a moving Italian painting, and I think the cinematographer did that on purpose, my favourite shot is where Henry's wife was abused and he's walking up to the abuser, there's no dialogue just the sound of his shoes tapping the floor. There are no bad guys in this film the only bad guys are the main characters, and somehow you root for them, that's how you make a good bad guy, you can understand their intentions.<br/><br/>And the acting? Oh my god. It feels like the cameraman's a ghost and he's just recording these people's daily life, they're all distinct and natural, even the background actors add to the realism of the world. There's narration throughout the whole film, films use this as a tool to dump exposition but this one uses it to explain the thoughts and feelings of the characters, it also shows how insanely twisted these gangsters are. Even though there isn't a main goal except for Harry wanting to be a gangster, this film manages to be entertaining through and through.<br/><br/>It's another classic gangster flick. And goodfellas is an absolute 10/10"

I thought that the composition of the story of this movie and the atmosphere of the movie was very similar to Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.
Especially the first half hour. The camera moved very well, and it was difficult for the audience to get bored at the same time. The shooting is very admirable. Each picture is very beautiful. It was beautiful because it was a film. There is characteristic music everywhere. How to use how music is very wonderful. Inundation of music.
The camerawork, photography and music symphony attracted us. If you look at the other films of this director, the scripts are always never a masterpiece. We screenwriters shouldn't try to learn scripts from this director. However. Though, the minimum elements that do not get the customer bored are included in the script.
Overall of those is very similar to Tarantino's Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. I was surprised that the great movie had such a good example. And I think that the director's true greatness is to discover a new atmosphere like this movie."

The films depiction of the mob is in no way glossy, there's no romantic aspirations of the life of a gangster, it simply puts it as it is. The violence, the cutthroat nature of the lives of these mobsters isn't watered down, if there ever was an anti gang film this may well be it. Ray liotta gives the performance of his career, a height he was never able to hit again and possibly should have earned him an Oscar. De Niro once again proves his craft as the sociopathic Jimmy, teaming up with director Martin Scorcese for a fifth time. Pesci undoubtedly steals the show as the blisteringly violent mobster Tommy De Vito. However the unsung performance of the film falls to Lorraine Bracco as the mob wife a role she play with great energy and brilliant depth, surely Oscar worthy.

","""Goodfellas"" is a movie based on the life story of Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta, and his involvement in the New York mafia. Henry's main partners throughout the movie are Tommy (Joe Pesci), James Conway (Robert De Niro), the boss Paul (Paul Cicero) and his wife Karen (Lorraine Braco). The movie revolves around a few different plot points as Henry moves through the mafia.<br/><br/>At the beginning, Henry is a teenager and responsible for small things, such as parking cars or selling stolen property. As he grows up he becomes fully entrenched into the mafia. The film does a great job of showing the family atmosphere of the mafia, especially showing the distinction between their public marriage and their private affairs, or ""Fridays are for girlfriends"" routine. <br/><br/>As Henry gets deeper into the drugs, you can see his physical appearance change. Their house, which was once very simply designed, becomes designed with wild colors and arrangements, representing the craziness of their lives. The settings continue to get more and more convoluted until he is finally arrested. As he has to choose between his mafia family and his wife and kids, you can understand how much he felt he lost - his entire identity.<br/><br/>Another method that was extremely effective was that throughout the movie, Henry narrated, explaining different actions of the mafia, what things meant, and how he interpreted things. Karen also narrated at the beginning, explaining her attraction to Henry, but giving a vivid account of how she interpreted the mafia from the outside, showing how different the two views were at the time. This was in contrast to a similar movie series, ""The Godfather,"" where very little narration took place. Both were effective ways of communicating the action, however the narration in ""Goodfellas"" ensured that the audience knew what was going on the entire time, whereas ""The Godfather"" allowed the audience to make up their own minds.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Goodfellas"" was an excellent film. The life in the mafia is always a bit of a mystery, and the film brought to light many different aspects of the life, from how they make money, to the killings, and their deep family life. The techniques the director used amplified in many ways Henry's life and his eventual arrest and the events thereafter. They helped form a bond with his character that almost made you feel sympathetic to him, and allowed the audience to really enter into the mafia lifestyle."

The acting performances are decent without there really being any stand out performances. Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci ( is he really not related in any way to Joe Paquale?) were probably the pick of the bunch amongst this star studded cast of big nosed very Italian looking actors.Robert De Niro didn't really play a big part and for most of the movie it felt like he was just going through the motions and doing a pretty decent impression of himself, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>The cinematography was good and there there lots of laughs, shocks, blood and twists along the way which I'd expect from a Scorsese film. The big problem from my point of view is that there isn't much of a plot. It's very artsy but there isn't much of a plot to keep me that interested. And I prefer a plot to grab hold of. That's probably because its a true story and they didn't want to make up too much stuff in case they offended the wrong people.

The other guy Jimmy takes with him and who eventually works with Henry is Tommy DeVito, played by Joe Pesci. This to me is the best performance of the film. DeVito is a character with a short fuse and Pesci played the character to perfection. This film shows why he is one of the finest actors of his generation and why he won an Oscar for his role. To me, his performance is what you will think of when the movie is over. All in all this was a fantastic film and definitely one of the best mob movies ever. As I said before, everything aspect of the film from start to finish is incredible. This is a film that no one should ever miss, especially if you are one who loves mob movies."
"meshai","8","1","1","11 November 2015"," 2 enthusiastic thumbs up
","I grew up loving the Godfather movies and this one was damn good. The way the story is told through the eyes of one of the characters only helps to draw you into the story. The relationships within the movie were well played and since this movie, I have declared Ray Liotta certifiable. Joe Pesci, who I usually find funny, began to irritate me but Paul Sorvino's Pauly truly made me feel like I could identify with these characters...he was awesome! The rest of the cast really helped to pull this amazing movie together. Then to find out it was actually based on a true story, WOW! There is no way that you can watch Goodfellas and tell me you didn't enjoy it! I did and I am super finicky with what I watch....I not only give this movie 2 enthusiastic thumbs up but I encourage you to re-watch it if its been a while!"
"RayKarago","10","1","1","28 April 2015"," How do you define a classic? You watch this film !
","I remember that this is one of the first films that I've ever seen that deserved to be called a ""classic."" I was absolutely mind blown, I was even shocked that the film is two and a half hours long but had just been sucked in for so long.<br/><br/>This film has some of the best acting you will ever see in your life. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci (who deserved his Oscar), Robert De Nero, Lorraine Bracco. Everybody was fantastic ! Everyone just deserved an Oscar. Ray Liotta and and Lorraine both gave effective and entertaining voice over narration and even the smaller roles from the likes of Samuel L. Jackson where entertaining.<br/><br/>The music was incredible, there is no score, its more of a combination of famous songs from the 50's 60's and 70's (matching the decades in which the film is set) and they all work, none of the songs feel shoe-horned, and they all pleasant to listen to.<br/><br/>This is Scorsese's best work, which is a big claim, and well earned. The shots were all great, including the tracking shot that has now become world famous and is taught in film schools all over the world. The use of lighting, the atmosphere were all at a level of perfection that only Scorsese can.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite films of all time."
"tommoslavtv","10","1","1","16 April 2015"," A timeless classic should be the standard that any film maker should aim for.
","Wow. This film is it. This is everything that makes a good film great and a great film legendary. Based on a true story spanning 30 years in the Mafia, this translation of Henry Hill's story to the movie screen was executed perfectly and stands as an obvious classic 25 years later.<br/><br/>Absolutely everything in this film is on point. The directing of 'Goodfellas' by Martin Scorsese is something of a landmark in film itself, how the man didn't win an Oscar for best director for this is beyond me. However, Scorsese's job must've certainly been easier whilst directing this set of actors who absolutely blew me away. The set and costume designs were also fantastic as they create a world that sucks you in and consumes your brain for it's run time. <br/><br/>Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta are both superb in portraying their characters and bringing them to life for an audience on the big screen, De Niro is tremendous as usual and Liotta was a perfect casting choice for Henry Hill. Liotta's scene where he walks across the street to confront the man was sexually harassing Karen and then begins to bash his skull in with a pistol is seriously one of the most memorable, timeless and also haunting scenes in the film. Henry Hill's anger and expression stay with you for a while after that scene, despite it being pretty short. <br/><br/>Whilst my hat is off the whole cast and crew behind this absolutely timeless classic, the man my applauds have to go to Joe Pesci. Pesci's portrayal as Tommy in this film is sensational, he owns the screen in every single scene he is in and undoubtedly deserved his Oscar for this performance. The improvised ""How am I funny?"" scene chokes you out with tension, tension only really being there because you never know what a man like Tommy DeVito could do and that is something Joe Pesci represented in this perfectly.<br/><br/>In my opinion, 'Goodfellas' is one of the greatest films of all time that has the perfect mix of sensational writing, acting and directing, bringing it all together to create a memorable and beautiful film that is re-watchable over and over."
"RobJW92","9","1","1","9 January 2015"," Best Gangster Movie
","The movie itself its notorious for being one of the best gangster films ever made. Centred on the book 'wise guy', it focuses on how Henry Hill a former gangster worked his way up through the mob family. Without reading the book I didn't know what to expect from the ending which I thought was brilliant. <br/><br/>The combination of De Niro, Liotta and Pesci work excellent in this film as you witness them grow into the film as like brothers working under Paulie. I think this movie provides everything you would want to keep watching....Action, Romance, Suspense and even a bit of humour thrown in. <br/><br/>Ultimately I would argue this as one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you haven't seen it, its a must watch!"
"Sonic_Ocean","10","1","1","29 May 2013"," A sharp-edges gangster film that has a script that is one the all time best. One of the greatest films of all time
","What makes Goodfellas such an enjoyable film for me would have to be its hard hitting, witty dialogue. If I have to pick a film that is a winner script-wise, Goodfellas would definitely be one of the top contenders. With a script like this, there are many lines that are good enough to be quotable, and it's very long list to choose from. And the desired effect is not only achieved by the script, it had to be the select number of people who be up to the task at bringing out the sharp wit of the characters and we have a cast that really shines in that department.<br/><br/>With Ray Liotta playing Henry Hill, his performance in letting you in on the character by putting you through his perspective with his narration alone is enough to pull you in and become captivated by the film. And as he pulls you into his world, we get introduced to numerous criminals he gets mixed up with such as Tommy DeVito played by Joe Pesci, who he plays with a lot of intensity that brings out a lot of the brutal elements in the film. When on screen, you can always sense something is going to go wrong, and what Pesci brings to this character is deserving of all the praise.<br/><br/>Every character evokes that sense of intensity that really gives this film its distinctive edge, but one person I seem to be captivated the most by in the movie would have to be Robert De Niro's performance as Jimmy Conway, who is crazier, but in his own more methodical way that is a lot more subtle than Tommy. What Bob brings to the table is something special that again shows how versatile he is as an actor and gives me another reason as to why I think he is the greatest actor ever. He may not be in every scene, but he is the foundation of the movie for me.<br/><br/>These are all great performances that help to bring out this story and to know that these are true events makes this film even more insane than it already is. While The Godfather felt more graceful and has placed a heavier emphasis on subtlety to make the violent scenes have more impact when they happen unexpectedly, Goodfellas is sharp all around its edges. Whereas The Godfather was violent, it offered insight into the human aspects of the criminals and the reasons they murdered for business. That sense of sentimentality is nonexistent in Goodfellas and offers a bare bones, raw insight into the crooked lives these criminals were leading, and with that, you get a story that is sharp like a knife that when it hits you, you'll know you'll never forget it."

","SEVERAL SPOILERS HERE...<br/><br/>This movie is great. The acting is superb, history is awesome and characters (especially Tommy) are unbelievable. I really don't know how many times i saw this movie. Every time when i saw it i replayed several moments in it.<br/><br/>That was: legendary scene ""what the f**k is so funny about me?"" :) this scene are one of the best scene ever made in film and Tommy DeVito also is one of the best character ever created. Joe Pesci is unbelievable here (i think that this time his acting beats Robert De Niro pretty hard:)). This sequence is very funny and at the same time you can feel the threat that is coming from all movements of Tommy. Also i was stunned when i saw acting in sequence when Tommy talks with Spider. Of course, Tommy does not only talk with him ;).(Michael Imperioli is better when he acts like a waiter here than like a mafioso in Sopranos:)). Also very well done is scene where Henry , Tommy and Jimmy are eating at Tommy's moms house. It's very funny and very ironic.<br/><br/>So i named some best moments in this film. Believe me, when these moments are joined together, we get crushing combination of humor, thriller and drama. It is full of gore mob life.

"j-665","10","1","1","15 February 2007"," the best mob movie.....ever!!
","In my mind this is the second best movie ever made after One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. Most people would argue that the Godfather 1 and 2 are the better mob movies. I must admit that the afformentioned movies are also brilliant and deserve to be in the top ten. I think the things that sways me towards Goodfellas are number 1, the dark sense of humour this movie imbues. The tone of the Godfather's can be much too serious at times. Just because it,s a serious drama doesn,t mean thers's no room for a little levity at times. This movie moves along quite nicely,while the Godfather gets a little bogged down at times....especially the wedding scene which in my mind was about ten minutes too long. Both movies had brilliant direction and performances....i guess i'll call that one a draw. If you like this one check out Casino. It's not as good as Goodfellas or the Godfather's but still very deserving of a viewing. Other mob recomendations are Miller,s Crossing, the Untouchables, Once Upon a Time in America, Scar Face and the Godfather Part 3, yes i just said that."

There's absolutely nothing that isn't linear, flat and dull about this film, it's just event after event, nothing subtle, ever, nothing about the state of mind of the characters, human condition, interesting dialog, nothing nothing nothing. De Niro is okay but widely anonymous. Liotta overplays a bit. Pesci's character is embarrassing (I know it's a biography, but still).<br/><br/>It's interesting really because it shows all people want is mafia violence, they just like to watch the event of homicide, doesn't matter how/where/who/when... It's looooooooooooong. It never ends. And it's so incredibly irrelevant. I tried to see the good about it. Nahh....nah this is just garbage. <br/><br/>And of course Scorsese picks the easy way out choosing to make this: just pick a mobster's real life story, put 3 renowned actors, write a dull screenplay, and film it.

But what is it's point? I mean, technically you have all the ingredients right here, but nothing exciting ever happens. Is there a great drama here? Or great action? Great dialogues? Something to think about later?<br/><br/>Seems like the movie's sole power comes from it being a biography of Henry and the Mafia. like their way of life by itself is supposed to charm with it's glamor and money. Perhaps it really did in the past decades? These are people who steal money, and murder each other mostly over small arguments. They have no grand visions, grand confrontations or dilemmas. Even the big heist is never shown.<br/><br/>The characters are grotesque and very simple-minded so it's very hard to connect with them. They reach no pathos, nor develop. If this story is real, it paints a very miserable reality that is hardly glamorous or amazing."

","This is a good movie, but I kind of know I am getting in bed with people I don't want to associate with in praising it.  There are those--many--who will just like the glorification of violence because they are shallow and they have created some kind of false bravado in place of real courage.  In other words, they are the kind of phonies who talk a big game and think they are pimps, but haven't an ounce of sexiness, character or true backbone. <br/><br/>     Now that I have dissociated myself from this group who likes the film, I will say that Liotta delivers an outstanding performance, and that the movie is very well done.  But it's just a movie, and not a life-changing one.  (Neither is Fight Club, for many of the same reasons).  It definitely is not ""The Godfather,"" but you need class to understand that."

","From the film's opening to it's conclusion I was hooked. What at first appears to be a glorification of the gangster lifestyle gradually evolves into a cautionary tale, graphically depicting the violence and treachery of this way of life. Based on the experiences of real-life ex-gangster Henry Hill, one-time associate of New York's Luchese crime family, the film gives an inside look at organized crime as it really is. Joe Pesci as the murderous Tommy DeVito absolutely steals the show. It is worth the price of the DVD just to see this talented and versatile performer in action. Ray Liotta gives a good performance as Henry Hill, but is overshadowed by Lorraine Bracco, who plays Henry's over-the-top wife Karen. Robert DeNiro's performance is so-so. Overall, I'd rate this an 8.5/10."

","One of the best Mob movies ever. Robert De Niro can always look dangerous. Ray Liotta, as always, looks like a total weasel. Good casting. Lorraine Bracco was great here, as was Paul Sorvino. But the real performance came from Joe Pesci, as the Academy recognized. I first saw him as the buffoon in the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies. Here, his unstable dangerousness (it's a word, look it up) oozes menace right off the screen. This film is very different from the Godfather films in that these characters are blue collar hoods, rather than top bosses. To me this brought home even more the evil, law of the jungle, credo of the mob. Very powerful stuff.<br/><br/>NOTE: I have the DVD, and the sound on it is not so good. The voiceovers and music are very loud, and the regular dialogue much too soft. It had me adjusting the volume throughout. C'mon, guys, for what DVD's cost, you can do better than that."

"odoylerules88888","10","2","4","16 November 2013"," Looking Back On an Instant Classic
","Director Martin Scorsese's GoodFellas is an American crime film based on the non-fiction book, Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pileggi. Pileggi used real life interviews with Henry Hill to create Wiseguy. GoodFellas takes viewers into the world of real organized crime in the Lucchese family from 1955 to 1980. GoodFellas features an all-star cast of Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino. GoodFellas was convincing because it used a very established cast. De Niro had experience working in other mob films before such as The Godfather Part II where he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. De Niro, along with Pesci, worked with Scorsese before in his 1980 film, Raging Bull, where De Niro won the Academy Award for Best Actor.<br/><br/>What Scorsese did extraordinary well with GoodFellas was creating a movie where the story was historically accurate with Hollywood drama that makes a film successful using engrossing characters and dramatic scenes. The story begins with Henry Hill (Liotta) who states, ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster,"" which shows his admiration and eagerness to join to mob. Hill starts out as a boy who did errands for the mob organizer, Paulie. Soon Hill grows up to be a wise and willing mobster and it doesn't take long for others to notice him. Hill soon gets involved with fellow mobsters Jimmy (De Nero) and Tommy (Pesci), who steal, embezzle, and whack fellow mobsters. Scorsese makes us feel Hill's intoxication with this crime family. Hill is obliviously thrilled with the danger of being in the mob and he fully embraces it. Membership of course comes with a big price because the only way out of the mob is by going into hiding or death. When Hill says at the end of the film, ""I'm an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook"", moviegoers see how thoroughly he's bought into the mob mentality. He doesn't know how to live any other way, and he fears normal life.<br/><br/>Scorsese's screenplay with GoodFellas was done in an innovative way because he wanted to make the sequences go out of order. When the film begins, a major whack scene from the middle of the film is shown at the beginning and the viewers don't know why. Soon the movie rewinds to the beginning and the scenes go middle, forward, and backwards. Scorsese wanted those scenes short and scattered because the impact on the audience later on would be terrific once everything soaks in. To add more authenticity, Scorsese wanted the movie's soundtrack to match the scene time periods. If a scene took place in 1971, you would only hear a song from that year or older such as Eric Clapton's, ""Layla."" Viewers who grew up in the 1950's though 1970's will enjoy the movie's nostalgic, classic rock soundtrack. <br/><br/>GoodFellas does not fall short on violence. No actor in the film better depicts a better example of a cold mobster than Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito. As Tommy, Pesci shows us how psychopathic mobsters see the world and how they treat the people in it. The way Tommy casually whacks people will have a memorable impact on the audience and put more fear of the mobsters into them. Pesci truly has you believing he is a narcissistic, maniac. <br/><br/>GoodFellas accomplished exactly what it was set out to do. Scorsese wanted to take real life crime events based on Henry Hill's interviews from Wiseguy and incorporate it into film where everyone could see just how the mob functioned in the mid-to late 20th century. GoodFellas is a prodigious achievement that puts this film into the categories of one of the best mob movies of all time."

","Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese turns GOODFELLAS into an engrossing gangster saga that provides a lot of intense actors with some meaty acting roles--among them, RAY LIOTTA (""I always wanted to be a gangster""), JOE PESCI, ROBERT DeNIRO, LORRAINE BRACCO and PAUL SORVINO.<br/><br/>The strong narrative follows the career of a youth, Henry Hill (RAY LIOTTA), an Irish lad living in a neighborhood ruled by the Italian Mafia who wants the easy life of crime and money and fancy cars and life in the fast lane. He enjoys the life of crime until it threatens to jeopardize the security of the life he has as a married man.<br/><br/>It's a film very similar in theme to ""The Godfather"", but not quite up to that level of achievement. RAY LIOTTA has never gotten enough credit for his leading role while most of the acting awards went to JOE PESCI as the gun happy hood with an explosive temperament in an Oscar-winning supporting role.<br/><br/>If you like this sort of thing, this will be your ticket. Some of the scenes have a strong impact with startling realism as far as the violence goes, and it moves smoothly toward a satisfactory ""crime does not pay"" conclusion. All of the performances are first rate and there's seldom a dull moment thanks to a soundtrack that includes a lot of pop songs of the period."

","Watching ""Goodfellas"", you certainly get the feeling that Martin Scorsese had wanted to make this movie for a long time. Thank God that he finally got to; it was probably his best movie up to that time. It shows the mafia world through the eyes of up-and-comer Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) is Henry's main entry point into the mafia, but Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) is also something else. Needless to say, there is a LOT of violence (well duh; this movie's about crime), but none of it gratuitous.<br/><br/>You may have heard of Joe Pesci's ""How am I funny?"" speech.

","""GoodFellas"" may be the most important film of the 1990s in the fact that its incredible success led to some of the other great movies of the decade. Films like ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Crying Game"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Fargo"", and ""L.A. Confidential"" would have likely never been made as well as they were without the influence of Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"". The film is an intense study of a Mafia family over a 30-year stretch. Ray Liotta plays the half-Irish, half-Sicilian kid from Brooklyn whose only dream is to be a gangster. Although Liotta's story is at the heart of ""GoodFellas"", it is the supporting cast that is the film's calling card. Robert DeNiro gives one of his greatest performances, Paul Sorvino is quietly effective, and Lorraine Bracco (in an Oscar-nominated role) does the best work of her career. However, it is Joe Pesci (in his well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) who steals every scene as the one who does the ""dirty work"". This is probably the definitive film in a decade that produced many film-noir styled classics. 5 stars out of 5."

","A Scorsese classic. It ticks all the boxes. Italians, gangsters, lots of fbombs, the lot. It's very well directed and the style changes throughout the film which compliments the narrative, e.g. romanticised and flowing at the beginning to jerky and unrhythmic at the end. The acting was also fantastic with everyone pretty much becoming a stereotype, especially joe Pesci. The script was tight as well, with a great twist at the ending. however I felt like his downfall cane a little too quickly and it ended quite abruptly.

","From Henry said, ""In my teens, I made more money than most adults in the whole street."" Revealing the first level, the most direct thing that gang life brings is money. Overnight, a prosperous life is at your fingertips. and. Along with the ""respect"" of the outside world, the ""extra care"" on the street greatly satisfied the vanity. This point reached a peak when Henry brought his newly engaged girlfriend into the restaurant through the back door. This long lens uses the camera's movement to the extreme. The gorgeous and smooth visual effect makes the audience feel the Henry's smoothness at the moment.
Then the situation changed sharply, and all the characters seemed to be in a madness: Jimmy began to kill a 6 million robbery, Tommy shot the young man in the bar for no reason, and was finally executed by the Gambino family (the beginning of the film has been paved) ... the film enters the second layer, the gang 's hidden tendency to self-destruction, the ease of gang life comes from the material provided by the gang, and the basic way for the gang to obtain material is terror and violence, so the essence of the gang is unethical violence, bringing The chaos makes its structure extremely unstable. This instability makes gangs often lose control when they encounter major turning points such as the drug industry.
This tendency towards self-destruction gradually develops towards the destruction of others, and the interpersonal relationships maintained by material and violence are more fragile than imagined. On the third level of the film, it is also a must-see scene for gangster films: the old brothers sold each other. Eventually Henry also chose to compromise and joined the witness protection plan. Over time, a small society disappeared in self-destruction and mutual destruction.
At the end of the film, Henry said, ""I feel like I can't leave that kind of life"", and then brought the film back to the beginning, again asking questions: knowing that it is towards destruction, why is there always someone willing to try? Because of that kind of life, an ordinary person who is in a muddled state can ""struggle"" to achieve achievements far beyond his ability. Can this gang legend be understood as a twisted American dream?"

","There's something really quite visceral about Goodfellas. Yes, one can dive into the more practical and technical reasons as to why its a great film (which I'll attempt to do), but ultimately its one of those films you finish watching and can't help but sit back and think wow.<br/><br/>I'm yet to see every Scorsese film, but this is top of the one's I've seen (including Taxi Driver, The Irishman and Wolf of Wall Street) - everything he does is just masterful. From the opening narration you just know you're in for a fantastic time with this film. One thing that really stands out are the characters. As mentioned above nobody does gangster films like Scorsese, and Goodfellas immerses us in the world of organised crime so craftily, fully and intelligently that it feels like there is a treat, nuance and reward in every single scene.<br/><br/>What I really enjoy about Scorsese's direction is his approach to violence. It's never gratuitous, and is often used sparingly, which really makes it stand out and gives it greater weight. It goes back to something Karen says in the film whereby the life of organised crime becomes normal to her after time (or words to that effect). I think as a viewer we experience something similar, in that we perceive the characters as 'good guys' in the sense that they are our protagonists, but the violence serves to snap us out of that and is used to great effect.<br/><br/>The characters in Goodfellas really push forward the story, and there is so much to digest and pick through in their actions that you will be constantly engaged. What Scorsese really does well is the relationships between the characters, with some standouts being Liotta's Henry and his wife Karen, as well as the triumvirate of Henry, De Niro's Jimmy and Pesci's Tommy. All three were fantastic, and Pesci's Oscar win is thoroughly deserved.<br/><br/>Scorsese's humour was on point as always, subtle and strewn across character, script and direction. I must also applaud the score for Goodfellas - perhaps the best for a Scorsese film? It just sets the tone so well for the film and added to the total immersion.<br/><br/>To sum up - watch Goodfellas if you know what's good for you!"

","Not only is Goodfellas is a movie I can starch off my Martin Scorsese watchlist, but it's also one of the best films in the gangster genre. The story flows smoothly with its characters and the emotional connection that the main character played by Ray Liotta has with the gang he's in with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. These supporting actors give powerful performances that make this movie riveting. What stands out from Goodfellas is that much of the film is just characters having conversations. Of course, there are unexpected bursts of Scorsese violence and all, but Goodfellas is an energetic film that never goes off track. The film's nearly 150 minutes long, but the thing is that it didn't feel like it. I'd say that for me, it felt 105 minutes. Once again, Goodfellas gives stunning performances, extraordinary editing, and an energetic story that never is tedious.

Slickly filmed, with a variety of film techniques such as the freeze-frames and narration. A wonderful cast full of amazing performances, most of all by Joe Pesci playing Tommy DeVitto. Incredible. Despite all this, it still felt like something was missing. Understandably this and WoWS are both based on true stories so they aren't blessed with the capability to add the twists and turns of a fictitious story, but it just felt that the movie went on, and on, until eventually it was over; without really too much of significance happening. We knew there would be shootings and deaths, this is a gangster film afterall, but any problem encountered was dealt with so easily that it no longer seemed a problem to begin with. Even in the final sequences where the main character had such a big decision to make, turning on his lifelong friends, somehow I barely felt anything. Perhaps another director could have squeezed more emotion out of those scenes and then, for me, this could be further up there, with the greatest films of all time that many have described this as.

"ferni-tierni","10","0","0","23 March 2020"," Analysis/Opinion We are the eyes, ears, perception of Henry Hill.
","Goodfellas is a voyage to the distant idiosyncratic existence of the mobsters in the 1970s. The movie achieves and excels in articulating a narrative that is rich with symbolisms that display a clear landscape of the philosophy that made the mobster families so efficient at crime. The movie gives you so much to work with in terms of description and metaphors that the viewer feels that you know the characters intimately. With good reason, in order to adapt properly Nicholas Pileggi's novel into a screenplay we needed to feel part of the mobster family. We are the eyes, ears, perception of Henry Hill in most of the movie, and it is conducted with brilliant detail that we immerse ourselves seamlessly into his phenomenology.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie we immediately get presented with a gallery of gestures that bring teenage Henry Hill's aspirations to life. For him anyone else that was not part of the mobster family was a nobody, and the dialogue did an accurate depiction representing the value that he placed on being someone. He wanted notoriety, respect, stability, wealth, blissful hedonism, and more than anything power. The mobster family gave him all that with the liabilities that he eventually discovered. We get entertained with one of those cautionary stories where a young person lives life too fast and is not aware of the consequences of his actions.<br/><br/>All throughout the movie we hear the excellent dialogue navigate us through the events of the protagonist's life. Scorsese used emotionally charged situations instead of descriptive statements to elicit a sensation from the viewer. For instance, instead of narrating: ""I had gained the respect of strangers and acquaintances"", he created situations that would demonstrate that event. This happened throughout the entire movie. The general tone and atmosphere of the crime family was of gratuitous irreverence. In this same tone he was able to introduce one of the best performances I have seen Joe Pesci deliver in any movie. In every scene, Tommy (Joe Pesci) was demonstrating to be an outrageous, sadist, amoral, macho, over the top, ruthless maniac.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of the film was also brilliantly used to solidify the tone of a scene. Scorsese masterfully navigated the viewers through various sensations using in tandem the soundtrack and the narrative in creative and diverse ways that immortalized moments within the film. Jimmy starts to descend into paranoia after the Lufthansa score, but before the viewer can begin to experience his degeneration, Scorsese shows us a scene of him looking suave, calm, collected, and reflective. This scene with the soundtrack attempts to mitigate his fall and preserve his status and gravitas.<br/><br/>We eventually see Henry cheating on his wife and degenerating into not being able to control his marriage and sleeping with other women. He starts to become reckless, dabble with drugs, fornicate and not abide to the mafia's ethos: We are not ""animale"" says ""paulie"" and tells him what to do to deal with the situation in an emblematic way that demonstrates that the crime family is always first than the blood family.<br/><br/>Jimmy, Tommy, and Henry carry the movie effortlessly, as is the attitude of the mobsters in the entire film. Their experience exudes sophistication, wisdom, proficiency, prowess, admiration. There are implicit and explicit gestures where we gradually get convinced that they indeed are worthy of admiration."

","To some extent, the most successful part of the film is its self-confidence in dealing with the rhythm and theme given by its authenticity.Its authenticity extends to the protagonist Henry's intention to join the gang, the desire for material desires, and a primitive and unadorned violent worship. At the same time, the unhappiness of family life gave him a desire to be recognized and recognized. Regarding his enthusiastic pursuit of self-worth recognition, he stuck his face to the window and looked at the people across the street. Since then, the whole film has always been compact, from his stepping into the den across the street to becoming one of them. Then met Tommy and Jimmy, and then went to commit crimes, start a family, commit a major crime, and finally went to jail, pleaded guilty, and assisted the police to confess other associates, and was included in the witness protection plan. From an outsider's perspective, I can't find the climax of the film. Some people say that the climax is Henry's imprisonment, but I think Scorsese will not be too interested in the popular theme of punishing evil and doing good. From the perspective of the dictator, the climax of the film should be the most popular part of the three brothers' illegal business. Since the killing of Tommy, the film has reached an inevitable ending."
"haydenluz","10","0","0","13 March 2020"," Top 5 Favorite Movie
","Goodfellas, directed & written by Martin Scorsese, produced by one of the best producers in the game today, in Irwin Winkler, is the most accurate, and my favorite mob movie of all time. Scorsese, Winkler & Pileggi crafted this beautifully told story, being nominated at the Oscars for Best Picture & Best Director. Marty displayed this incredible sense of direction, while pulling source material right out of Nicholas Pileggi's book, titled Wiseguys, based off of Henry Hill's life.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is a masterpiece whichever way you want to look at it. The story was a true, authentic representation of not only Henry Hill's life, but what life was like in the mafia, back in the 60s/early 70s. Some scenes probably came off as theatrical, or done for amusement, but according to Henry Hill himself, the content is 99.9% accurate, and ultimately dumbed down. With the narration from Ray Liotta, it brought all of the content from the previous scene together, making everything flow much better throughout the film.<br/><br/>The cast director in Ellen Lewis casted the absolute best, star studded cast possible! Each character had their own sense of comradeship. Ray Liotta was the star of this film. The attention to detail by all of the characters, especially Jimmy Burke, was nothing short of impeccable. After being so invested into his character throughout the movie, I did some further research on how he prepared for this film, and it only made his performance that much better, seeing the hard work he put in. His character development throughout the film is so bonkers! I changed my opinion on him a few times, due to all of the crazy antics he has to go through. The most notable performance of the film, was by one of my favorite actors, in Joe Pesci. He portrays Tommy De Simone's crazy, ludacris persona PERFECTLY, although he couldn't really embrace his physical structure, to say the least ðŸ˜‚. Pesci was nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, but fell short to Denzel Washington, in Glory. Bob De Niro put on yet another stellar performance. His character was heavily focused on, to help build our main ""antihero"" in Ray Liotta. With a character with such a high stature, De Niro is the only casting that makes sense. Lorraine Bracco was the character the audience really felt for. She put on such a great, dramatic performance, selling every scene. She was also noticed at the Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, but came up short to Brenda Fricker, in My Left Foot. Paul Sorvino always does a great job in these type of roles, but this time, I wish we got a little more of him. For someone who really meant a lot in the true story, he didn't have too much screen time, but when he did, he made a nobale and witty statement everytime. Even though I absolutely loved Sorvino's performance, he was probably my least favorite character, due to the justice that wasn't served to his high caliber character. The only minor take away from the characters as a whole; all of these characters (except Lorraine Bracco) are equally as violent, but they dumbed a few characters down.<br/><br/>The script by Martin Scorsese & Nicholas Pileggi (who also went on with Scorsese to do Casion), was BRILLIANT! With the popularity behind it, some of the dialogues were borrowed by other writers, who incorporated their tweaked version to their own work. The script was honorably nominated at the Oscars, and in my opinion, robbed by Alfred Uhry, who wrote Driving Miss Daisy. The script carried too much weight, being so witty, and sliding in plenty of laughs, to not win the award.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus, who
did After Hours & the Last Temptation of Christ with Marty & went on to do The Departed & Gangs of New York as well with him; utilized so many brilliant tools to create such a beautiful picture, with immaculate frame work. Ballhaus utilized great steady cam work, with intelligent usage of freeze frames, to capture important moments. He also used these great, eye-level seeking shots, displaying the amazing scenery and characters. Come the final act, things got were little different, being much more high paced. Thelma Schoonmaker started utilizing the score and music more, to enchace the tone, and feelings. Schoonmaker kept up with her great edits, but started to incorporate snappy edits, with fast camera movements. This movie could've easily been three & a half, to four hours long, if they really wanted to capture everything. Alone, there was 36 minutes cut from the film, and everytime I see this film, I wonder what it would be like. Schoonmaker who was also nominated for an Oscar, being absolutely snubbed. This was one of, if not the best edited movie I've seen.<br/><br/>The action was very stylish, gory, brutal, with a great 60s feel. The action was displayed almost to a T, but according to Henry Hill, it was dumbed down a little because things were way more explict.<br/><br/>Overall, this will forever go down as, not only one of the best mafia movies, but one of the best movies of all time.<br/><br/>PS, if you haven't seen the Joe Pesci rap video, DO SO ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£"

","This is a great movie and there's no denying that. Is it the pinnacle of gangster cinema? Is it the icon of icons? I don't know. The performances are incredible, specifically De Niro and the actor who plays Karen. Pesci is iconic. I struggle with the tension, or seeming lack thereof at times. Visually, I'm sure it was fantastic for its day. It keeps you involved throughout, but it lacks a narrative tension that I desire to take it from 8 to 9 or 10"

This and other memorable scenes are better than movie as a whole. There are great actors (DeNiro, Pesci, Sorvino).

"Jeremy_Urquhart","10","0","0","5 February 2020"," May always be my favourite movie
","I feel drawn to give Goodfellas a review right now, likely because it's been approximately a decade since I first watched it, and also because it turns 30 this year (oh, and Scorsese's fantastic The Irishman has been on my mind a whole lot since I saw it a few months back). I loved Goodfellas the first time I watched it, and on every rewatch I've given it in the past 10 years, it's only gotten better and better. I could watch it every year or two and I don't think I'd ever get tired of it.<br/><br/>Of course when a film this great is loved by so many people, what can I say about it that's interesting or fresh? All I can really do is add my voice to the already existing sea of people praising Goodfellas and offer my opinion that yeah, it really is that good. It deserves its classic status despite not being as old as we'd maybe usually consider a 'classic,' as well as despite of the fact that it really doesn't feel old at all. The main thing that dates Goodfellas is that we know it's old because of how much younger still recognisable stars like DeNiro and Pesci look now.<br/><br/>Speaking of DeNiro and Pesci: they're both absolutely fantastic. DeNiro is a little more understated here than he is in some of his best and most hard-hitting performances (namely Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, two other great Scorsese films), but Pesci delivers the role of his career here. He's fantastic: so terrifying and despicable, but also funny and bizarrely human. I think the relationship with his mother (played by Scorsese's adorable real life mum) humanises him to a degree, and Pesci does such a great job at showing why everyone around his character fears and respects him that I think some of that rubs off on you as an audience member. You can't help but like him while you also hate him.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta deserves praise too, as he largely carries the movie, and despite not quite being a big star on the same level as DeNiro or Pesci, he really is just as good here, and delivers a performance as good as those two give. His voiceover narration is also one of my favourites out of any film I've ever watched. Lorraine Bracco is also great, and it's good to get a surprisingly compelling female perspective on the mob lifestyle. She's something of an audience surrogate, so well-implemented you might not even realise it at first; her mix of horror and awe at the life she finds herself in I think mirrors what most of us would feel if put into a similar situation. I'm glad she also got a chance to shine throughout The Sopranos too, because she's an immensely talented actress that although having those two great roles, probably deserved better.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast could well be worth mentioning too, but then we'd be here forever. Even minor supporting characters with one or two lines are incredibly memorable (Jimmy Two Times, Jimmy Two Times!!) And then I could go on and on about the amazing soundtrack, with every single song choice being absolutely perfect and adding so much energy. And then there's Thelma Schoonmaker's editing, and based on her track record with Scorsese, these two complement each other so well. In all honesty, the editing in Goodfellas is not only Schoonmaker's best work, it might well be one of the best edited movies of all time- the pacing is perfect, and two and a half hours flies by yet without anything feeling rushed or hasty. And Scorsese... he'll always be one of my favourite filmmakers, and I love that even now he's still giving it his all and making great films (his last three as of the time of writing, The Wolf of Wall Street, Silence, and the aforementioned The Irishman were all great and amongst the best of their respective years). Still, Goodfellas might well be his best work. Everything feels so complete and right and perfectly put together. It is an impeccably well crafted film, with every shot, every camera movement, every editing trick, every song, and every line of dialogue adding something and making the film as good as it can be.<br/><br/>I always find myself in awe of films when they're as good as this one. The compliments I could throw at this movie may well be endless, but in less than 1000 words here I've probably said enough, especially given it's not hard to find other people who love this movie who've already said much of what I've said and then some. It's absolutely worth a watch if you haven't gotten around to it yet for whatever reason, and even if you have, it's just as worthy of a rewatch. Like I said, from personal experience, I notice something new and gain a new sense of appreciation for it every time I revisit it. It's inspiring and wonderful that a film this great can exist, and it will stick with me and surely remain a personal favourite of mine until the day I die."

","One word: Flawless. This film devours the meaning of great acting and great direction and swallows it up, now Martin has directed a lot of flawless pictures, but this is honestly up to par with The Godfather as one of the best movies of all time, this movie is nothing but pure greatness and an example of what other movies should be but aren't. Martin Scorsese is directing an amazing picture but spitting in other director's faces in the process because nobody's better at this than he is, he said he would never return to the genre of crime drama or gangster films ever again. And jeez am I happy he did making gangster movies such as; Casino, Gangs of New York, The Departed and The Irishman. Film of the 1990's and deserves its' praise. SPOILERS FROM NOW ON: There is one scene (which I am obviously gonna spoil) where Jimmy thinks Tommy is being made, but Tom notices a bit too late he fell into a trap, the people who offered him this were friends of Billy (the guy he kills by shooting around three times and hides the body) they had just found out that he killed their friend, they shot him in the head. Now the opening line is possibly the most quotable line in film history, ""As far back as I remember I always wanted to be a gangster"". Not only does this line set you up for the entire theme of the movie, the narration in this film is possibly the most perfect narration ever put in film, we see Henry's perspective and his wife Karen's perspective, both points of view. Violence is like the main character in this movie and is the best performance, the film should have won a lot of Academy Awards and that's based on actual facts. Grade: A+"

","Typically when it comes to Mafia movies most people cite The Godfather pt 1 or 2 or this as all time favorite. Goodfellas is my favorite and is among director Martin Scorsese's best work. This is excellent storytelling and cinema with top tier camerawork, writing and editing. The ensemble cast did a phenomenal job knocking this out of the park giving authenticity to these characters and with Scorsese's tight direction brings this story to life. Even though Robert De Niro is a in a supporting role, this is still some of Scorsese's best work. Ray Liotta was up and coming as an actor and rises to the occasion as the lead in this film as mobster Henry Hill, holding his own cast alongside Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. As a whole the film comes together perfectly with great chemistry from the cast, no one outshines anybody and everything is done to service the story. The film might be longer than the average film, but never seems so as it has the viewer engrossed in the story. In my opinion this is perfect(or nearly flawless) film making. It is criminal that this did not win an Oscar for best film of that year, but through the years this really holds up and not only is this the best mob movie in my book, this is one of the best movies ever made and is mandatory viewing for anyone that wants to see a great movie."

"andrewroy-04316","9","0","0","29 November 2019"," An impeccable deep dive into the allure and insidiousness of the crime world
","Goodfellas isn't a sprawling gang epic as I for some reason expected, but instead a much more personal and revelatory look at how a young man admires gangsters, becomes one and watches it envelop every part of his life, until he has no option but to reluctantly rat out his partners. The narration and camera work is extremely effective in making the viewer feel like they're going on this journey with Henry. It's certainly saying that crime snakes into every part of these men's lives, making them feel greedy and entitled to a lifestyle that they hadn't earned but also would have been unattainable by legal means, and the way it sours friendships, marriages, and personal sanity is obvious. Equally relevant, however, is how exciting and flashy it is when it's happening. You feel on top of the world, have all these friends, and can afford a luxurious lifestyle. It's easy to empathize with Henry and understand how he reached the point he did, even as we recognize how horribly twisted his priorities had gotten, and that's no small feat by Scorsese. Liotta is great in showing this transformation, and Pesci and De Niro were also great as crime lord characters. The ending really drives this duality home: what Henry laments in the film's conclusion isn't all the mistakes he made or that he gave up his friends (both would be reasonable), but that he no longer gets that glamorous life and has to live a humdrum daily existence. You'd think this would be a welcome and ideal change after how crime ruined his marriage and came close to killing him, but he misses the thrill of it. It's not hard to compare the narrative arc to one of drug addiction, where he craves the high until it envelops every part of his life. Scorsese's direction and script are wonderful, as the repetitive dialogue and the suddenness of violence in many scenes added to the authentic, gritty atmosphere of crime. It's a standout film by all accounts, and absolutely deserves its spot in the film pantheon as an all-time great movie."

","Goodfellas is one of (if not the) the best movies that Martin Scorsese has made, and the best of the gangster genre. Every frame of this movie is used to its benefit, never skimping out on details, spanning across two decades of crime, the scope is immense, but the ambitions of the filmmakers and the cast makes it all possible and create an absorbing, violent gangster thriller. The performances are all led by actors at the top of their game, Joe Pesci especially giving a manic, schizophrenic performance as a mob boss under too much pressure, holding too much power. And ultimately that's what Goodfellas is, it's a morality tale of absolute power corrupts absolutely. The technicality of the camerawork furthers the draw and appeal of this gritty film, bringing the setting and characters together, until the sobering concluding words fill the screen and the credits roll. Goodfellas is quintessential filmmaking at its finest, and one that has and will stand the test of time."

","What's interesting is what Martin Scorsese said about adapting Nicholas Pigleggi's book: if they concentrated the scenes and the timelines together, ""the effect would be terrific."" Here, what you're dealing with is what's scattered around the country -- boring, Franki Valli records and card games and formal attire -- jam-packed together in a way you could see there's some vitality to, and how. For once, the motives propelling all these cultural impulses -- what else can I say? -- like Henny Youngman have their backbone revealed, the electricity behind putting all these things out there: The pleasure of running thing. ""Just like they did in the old country ... "" Right.<br/><br/>So, here's most of America -- the kind that got made fun of in ""The Simpsons,"" because everyone had gotten sick of it -- pulled together by the guy Manny Farber says, like Terrence Malick in ""Badlands,"" did with his ""Mean Streets"" a reflection of how people live nowadays with postcards, home movies, and other filtered media. There's so much on display, so much in the participatory background, that was consciously chosen by Scorsese, that you could hardly pay attention to it all -- even the TV show Karen's watching when she lets the agents in to search her home (""She spit on her own floor! Why would anyone *do* that? I figure it was just easier to be polite!"") seems put there on purpose.<br/><br/>And the rest of us are schnooks ... ""ordering pasta and getting egg noodles with ketchup."" Scorsese lets us in on the backstory, and all hell breaks loose. And the world would never be the same."

This is my third time watching this piece of art, Martin Scorsese Co-wrote and directed this masterpiece and I'm still amazed how good it is. He knows the Gangster genre inside and out and with his knowledge he could succeed in making one of the best movies in the world, something that will take many decades to recreate as this is perfection, art in media form.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci truly deserved his Oscar for Supporting Actor as his performance is memorable and superb, truly becoming the character he's playing. The rest of the cast is also spectacular. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Lorraine Blacco is the other three that did superb work on bringing their talent to the role. I have to say though, this isn't Robert's best performance but it's certainly one of his most iconic and memorable as it shows he have mastered the way of playing a Wise Guy and his skill of acting without speaking, in the eyes and different kind of expressions. For the Sopranos fans out there, this movie has a lot of actors that would later play characters on that magnificent TV Show.<br/><br/>This is really one of those definite gangster and crime movies, I believe Martin Scorsese new movie The Irishman will also be one of those memorable and definitive gangster movies. GoodFellas is truly a masterpiece, giving us a really special narrative that will make you re-watch the movie many times for the great crime story and the well written dialogue.

Goodfellas is as compelling and absorbing as any crime drama I have ever seen. The script shows all the facets of these characters; they are all fully developed individuals capable of great good and great evil. The moral ambiguity of their lifestyle is treated with a shrug. Goodfellas is not about Mafia dons, but about those who exist on a lower level. It's about the bonds that are formed between compatriots in crime, and how betrayal is the most heinous offense imaginable. Cinematography is a highlight and there are long pans and innovative flourishes, all designed to enhance the mood and involve the viewer in the action. On one occasion, the camera sweeps around a bar then into a back room, pausing on faces as Henry's voiceover introduces each of the wise guys. Later, we are presented with the famous, disorienting shot of Henry and Jimmy facing each other across a table at a diner."

","The success of The Godfather Trilogy, Scarface, and The Untouchables has made it clear that America loves a good gangster film. One the most recognizable and high performing gangster films of the 20th century is Martin Scorsese's 1990 work Goodfellas. Featuring mobster staples Robert De Niro as Jimmy and Joe Pesci as Tommy, Goodfellas tells the life tale of mobster turned informant Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). Starting humbly as a cabbie in New York, Henry becomes a well respected mobster by age 21. However, after a stint in jail with other members of the crew, Henry turns to the drug game even though his boss, Pauly, orders him not to. After a successful FBI sting, Henry is faced with two options: get whacked by his paranoid cronies or sell them out for a seat in witness protection.<br/><br/>Goodfellas features the full Scorsese palette: engaging montage, Irish-American identity, dirty New York, and narrative voice over. Ray Liotta captivates the audience with his performance, often appearing like a victim more than a criminal. Joe Pesci is despicable as a violent and ill-tempered Italian mobster. Even though the film spans over 30 years, every scene feels authentic. Cars, clothing, and word choice are accurate to their respective era.<br/><br/>The only problems with the film are a plethora of continuity errors. This seems like a trivial complaint, but the coming and going of objects within the same instance at different camera angles is extremely distracting.<br/><br/>With a run time of 2 hours and 26 minutes, Goodfellas is full of narrative delight and character growth. It engenders a warm sense of unity within the Italian-American mob. Each viewer is jealous of the love and opulence shared by its members. But all of that is stripped away in the final act as the true motivators behind the mob's actions (lust, greed, and violence) tear it apart. Brother turns on brother and Made Men become funny guys... funny dead guys."

","While this film did not speak to me personally, it is qualitatively a work of great precision and artful scheming. Martin Scorsese does not disappoint in this dynamic and creative shot film, and the actors deliver a compelling study in characters. In a life long biographical account of Henry Hill and his extensive career in marriage and the mob, this film follows the misadventures and crimes of Henry.The camera work is creative and follows the action in a streamline fashion that showcases Henrys smooth and socially adept manners to full advantage. Scorsese marries his signature style with at the creative camera work, and works well with Ray Litotes (Henry) acting style."

"lacatusalexandru","10","0","0","19 February 2019"," Goodfellas-Martin Scorsese best movie he ever made
","Martin Scorsese is probably ,and this is just my opinion,one of the greatest directors ever.
I've seen a lot of great mafia movies and I've played some great mafia games as well and up until now I thought that''The Godfather'' is the best mob movie ever made but I was wrong.
Goodfellas is the greatest mob movies ever made,''The Godfather'' being on the 2nd place.
Most films, even great ones, evaporate like mist once you've returned to the real world; they leave memories behind, but their reality fades fairly quickly. Not this film, which shows America's finest filmmaker at the peak of his form. No finer film has ever been made about organized crime - not even ''The Godfather'' although the two works are not really comparable.
Like ""The Godfather,"" Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"" is a long movie, with the space and leisure to expand and explore its themes. It isn't about any particular plot; it's about what it felt like to be in the Mafia - the good times and the bad times.
Also Ray Liotta gives a thrillingly livewire and career-defining performance as the wide-eyed aspirational tough guy Henry himself, whose gorgeous gravelly voice gives this film its sensational voiceover, along with Robert De Niro as well as Joe Pesci.
The film's style in the second half turns into a frenetic, feverish mimicry of the wasted-looking Liotta's coked-up mental state. De Niro, who's in the process of sealing his own destruction by eliminating fellow participants in a big heist, goes along with the new economics of crime, and Liotta winds up having to choose in a pinch between freedom and loyalty.
Overall,''Goodfellas is not just one of the greatest masterpiece of Scorsese but it's also a movie that you can't get tired of watching it again because of the great story,the great action scenes and because of the astonishing performance of the cast,especially Ray Liotta and the legendary Robert De Niro."

","The way I wrote my book For A Pint of Mother's Milk was inspired a lot by how this movie was made: great storytelling is not about the plot, it's never about the plot; it's about the journey and the small details within it: the way you sliced garlic in prison, how rare your steak was cooked, what Pauli said and how he said it, the small interesting piquing elements that strike joy in the audience's heart; they'll feel terrific but they won't exactly know why! It takes guts to tell a story with no explicit plot and tell it well; then it's all about the treatment, and all about the direction: if it doesn't work you take all the blame, if it does, you basically strike gold. The only way to go for purely narcissistic directors and writers."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Goodfellas premiered in 1990. The movie is directed by Martin Scorcese and stars Ray Liotta Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci. The movie follows three men in the criminal underworld that they want to ascend. The movie follows these three characters as they traverse the criminal world across the 145 minutes of running time.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is a masterpiece movie by Martin Scorcese. The movie is incredibly well directed. Martin Scorcese should deserve a lot of accolades for directing this movie so well. Every scene in this movie has a nice rewatchability to it. These scenes take on a new meaning on multiple watches. This is also helped by the highly energetic style of the directing. The entire movie moves at a fast pace and there is never a dull moment. Even the scenes that are more on the quiet side are directed in an interesting way to bring out the best in the actors.<br/><br/>The three main leads in Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci do a phenomenal job in this movie. Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill as he climbs the ladder of the mafia. It is fun to watch Henry as he lives a criminal life and interacts with characters played by the other two leads. Every scene that has any of these leads is well-acted and directed. Joe Pesci plays a hot-headed mobster in Tommy DeVito. This character is incredibly memorable. Joe Pesci absolutely puts in a performance of a lifetime into the character of Tommy DeVito.<br/><br/>The story in this movie is rather simple to follow and has many fun twists. The entire movie is narrated by Henry Hill and incredibly well edited As said before, this is a movie that does not have a dull moment. Much of this is owed to the editing, directing, and acting. The story has no problems showing loads of gore and unpleasant scenes to the audience. This is expected from looking into a mobster's life. The movie does not only focus on crime. It also focuses on the home life between Henry and Karen. This drama that arises from the life of crime is engrossing to watch.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","If you are into gangster flicks and you haven't seen this movie yet, what on earth are you waiting for?
This movie is amazing, a complete package for 2 hours and 25 minutes. Goodfellas gives you an overview of a life of a mobster. This is not your typical 'crime' movie so don't expect a lot of action. The movie mainly revolves around 4 characters, Henry, Paulie, Jimmy and Tommy. The way these characters are portrayed is just lovely!
There are a lot of characters in this movie and getting familiar with their names can be confusing at times. Though fast paced, it happens to be lengthy and you would, at one point, look at timeline and expect for the climax to appear sooner. But that doesn't mean you'll be bored. This movies will keep you on the edge of your chair and at times will make you cringe at some of the brutal scenes.
It's a must watch, intense, violent and one hell of a movie that you must not miss!"

"CinemaClown","Null","0","0","29 September 2018"," A Thoroughly Investigated, Extensively Detailed & Wickedly Amusing Crime Opus
","An extensively investigated, thoroughly detailed & wickedly amusing crime opus that's stylishly directed & brilliantly acted, Goodfellas is considered by some to be an even better crime drama than Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather and while I don't share the same sentiment, I don't deny its influence & impact on the films that followed into its footsteps.<br/><br/>Goodfellas chronicles the rise & fall of mob associate Henry Hill & his friends from the 1950s to 1980s. The story follows his journey in the mafia world, covering his relationship with his wife and his two associates Jimmy Conway & Tommy DeVito, as the trio work their way up through the mob hierarchy, and culminates with the events that lead to their eventual downfall.<br/><br/>Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film begins in the middle and then work its way around it before coming full circle in the end, thus taking us on a riotous journey that's never tiring. The dialogues are sharp & piercing, the chemistry between the trio has a genuine quality & a sense of brotherhood to it. The violence is brutal & unflinching, and the characters are lively & compelling.<br/><br/>The filmmaking technicalities are handled really well, giving its images a frenzied vibe as if things may explode anytime without warning, and they do on multiple occasions. Also notable is the neat cinematography that makes its apt set pieces stand out. But the story as a whole still feels longer than it needed to be, and its 145 minutes runtime is severely felt during the second half.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Goodfellas features a reliable cast in Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci & Ray Liotta, with Pesci stealing the show with a wild, deranged act that overshadows all in his vicinity. Liotta is in as Henry Hill and delivers an impressive lead show that only gets better with time. De Niro chips in with an assured input yet he feels somewhat under-utilised. Lorraine Bracco & Paul Sorvino also provide excellent support and leave a lasting impression of their own.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Goodfellas captures the glamorous & grisly side of organised crime with finesse and offers a consistently thrilling ride to finish as a fascinating example of its genre. The story is at its best when the screen is shared by the trio but loses steam when it focuses on their individual lives. Riveting at first, the film ends up running a tad too long for me and the interest is already lost by the time it nears its conclusion. A well-researched account of a real-life story, Goodfellas is admirable in its own ways but to rank it alongside The Godfather is pure lunacy."
"patrickwelty","10","0","0","29 September 2018"," One of the best storytelling films ever
","This is how you tell a story and make an epic movie. Scorsese knew then and still knows today how to take an era (in this case the 50s -70s) and give a relatedable and realistic, yet completely foreign account of a life of crime. Casting is probably the best I've seen ever. How do you get so many amazing wise guys that fit the role. DeNiro Liotta and Pesci are the stars and steal the show but Bracco is electric. <br/><br/>I grew up on this movie and it has shaped how I think about life. Living as a Goodfella meant confidence which I respect but it also meant risking everything."
"VritzBil","10","0","0","23 September 2018"," Redefined the Gangster genre..
","The best Scorsese movie by far in my humble opinion, Goodfellas is a movie that takes the viewer in an unprecedented wild trip of crimes committed senselessly and, sometimes, for the absolute silly reasons. Is a movie that deglamorized the Mob and showed us what really it is being a member of it. The acting, writing, atmosphere, and the perfect direction by Scorsese makes the movie an enduring mark in the crime genre and history of film in general."

There was no cool mafia like God father, and in reality I thought that I would kill or betray people from my own greed and doubt like this.<br/><br/>There is no place where the hero of the Scorsese movie can sympathize with ordinary people at all, neither my life nor circumstances are different, but I think that the director is really good at making the audience perform the hero's life.<br/><br/>There are things that are not laughing in movies, but there are many narrations and editing like everyone else, scenes that laugh at unfairness with BGM. Especially Joe Pesi who does not understand anger points well is really scary. Such a person should be around.<br/><br/>I think that the coolness of the movie of the wild rumor is full. Looking at the expression of Ray Riotta laughing masochistically towards the camera in the end, I am filled with the emotional feeling that ordinary dull life is waiting and the feeling of missing out the lively Ray Riotta in the middle of the movie ."
"ChubbyChecker","10","0","0","9 September 2018"," Literally my favourite film
","It's hard to put into words exactly why this is my favourite film, or what it is that makes it so flawless.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's the ambitious way the scenes are put together. Many film makers would take a scene like Pesci's ""Funny how?"" rant or the one take walk into the Copacabana and say ""You know what, that's the highlight, the whole film will revolve around that"". Not Scorsese though, it's almost as if he tried to better himself in every scene and in many ways, he did just that.<br/><br/>I look at the 2 and a half hour run time and find it very difficult to think of what could be cut. Whether it's the wedding scene, the scene at Tommy's mother's house, or the montage showing prison life. Almost every scene in this film is a lesson in what good film making should be, and, more importantly, enhances the story that is unfolding. <br/><br/>It's almost as if the subject matter of the film doesn't matter. Some will see the gratuitous violence, lack of moral compass and abhorrent lifestyles on display and dismiss the film for those reasons. Goodfellas is so much more than that though, a triumph in cinematography and a masterpiece of storytelling. <br/><br/>Many have likened this film to the Godfather series. To compare Goodfellas to The Godfather does both films a disservice though. Yes, they're both about the mafia, but the way the story is told is so different they might as well be different genres."

","While an argument could be made that 'Goodfellas (1990)' perhaps comes dangerously close to glamourising the gangster lifestyle it portrays, this sprawling and relentless picture depicts three-decades of mob life through the eyes of a real-life ex-mafioso who entered into the witness protection program in the early 1980s and ultimately manages to maintain an impartial stance by simply portraying all the events the way they are remembered to have occurred. Our protagonist also never actually kills anyone and his desperate, drug-fuelled downfall is just as detailed as his seduced start. Scorsese directs the piece with a real ferocious verve and the improvised dialogue lends a genuinely unpredictable edge to most sequences, leading to an almost fly-on-the-wall feel even though the techniques used are inherently cinematic. When the violence explodes onto the screen, it is just as shocking as you'd expect it to be. The only downside of all this is that the already long film feels even longer due to the fast-pace and sheer amount of scenes - a minor complaint since it's all so entertaining. 8/10"

","Few movies purely about the life in the mob can truly capture perfection as Goodfellas manages to do so well. It has less sugarcoating compared to the more tame and inaccurate The Godfather ( Which is inferior to Goodfellas objectively speaking. ) and it has more brutality and realism. <br/><br/>The movie starts off with a flashback to a later scene in which a certain character is beat up, dumped into the back of a car and driven to a spot to be buried by the three main protagonists. However, when the movie starts all the audience hears is a thud, we don't know what is happening yet. As everybody gets out of the car they find this character is not dead yet, and continue to respectively stab and shoot this person to death in cold blood. After which, the iconic line 'As far back as i can remember i've always wanted to be a gangster' is said by Henry Hill's ( Ray Liotta ) narration and the story starts with a young Henry Hill. Now what Scorsese has done here is introduce us to the brutal nature of both the mob business and the three main characters in an introduction lasting for a bit longer than a minute, it is the ultimate beginning to a movie which instantly sets the tone for everything else there is to come.<br/><br/>
You know during the entire movie that anybody could get killed at any time, and what happens is far from predictable, especially when Tommy DeVito ( Joe Pesci ) enters the screen, you have absolutely no idea what to expect. One of the other reasons Goodfellas is such a masterpiece is due to the incredible cast it has. Robert de Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci & Paul Sorvino in the lead all seem to actually be mobsters, instead of acting like them. Enhanced by further excellent performances by Lorraine Bracco & Frank Vincent, it really is an acting masterpiece of film.<br/><br/>The movie follows the life of Henry Hill together with excellent narraton provided by Ray Liotta from the 50s all the way up to the very start of the 80s, and as the movie starts out with the mostly positive and beneficial terms of the mob life for Henry, which usually has 50s love songs playing in the background, later in the timeline of the movie things get bloody and ugly and Scorsese both changes the tone of the songs to give it a more serious vibe and he also changes the generations of them ( for example, 50s songs for the 50s parts, 60s for the 60s.. etc. ). It immerses you into the film and the timeline that is being played at that point.<br/><br/>Ofcourse the single greatest sequence is the Copacabana steadycam shot through the kitchen. Trackingshots are always impressive, but even more so when it also tells the story of how popular Henry is. <br/><br/>With a fantastic screenplay, dialogue that never seems to be out of place, superb acting, brilliant music choices, lack of sugarcoating and actually showing the facts of how brutal the mob life can be, it is an absolute masterpiece of cinema."

","Goodfellas is a wiseguy movie with them doing wiseguy things. You know: robbing and stealing. Beatings and wackings. Extorting and racketeering. Cussing and swearing. I don't want to minimize the movie to just that but that was the gist of it all.<br/><br/>The movie is told from the view of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a gangster that loved mob life and all it had to offer. Henry Hill is essentially doing a tell all about being a mobster and how mobs operate.<br/><br/>What I found most interesting about the movie my second time watching was how sanctimonious mobsters are. Almost like because they have rules that govern their illicit behavior they're better than other criminals. Sure, they'll rob, steal, kill and other crimes but their criminality is not like the criminality of others; almost like there is a nobility to their criminality. The reverence to that lifestyle and the Italian mafioso culture in general could be heard and felt throughout the movie. Henry Hill absolutely loved being a mobster. When I was younger I was fascinated by the lore of it as well (albeit from a great distance, as in from an audience watching on movies) but now I see them as criminals like anyone else. Granted, they are more successful at it than most and they have done very well with their PR but they are still criminals.<br/><br/>Goodfellas actually made me see that as Henry narrated about the beatings and killings of criminal and innocent people. Henry was wrapped into all kinds of lowlife activity. His two pals James Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy Devito (Joe Pesci) were savages that would murder anyone in their way. And Tommy would murder just because--he had to be the worst mafia representative ever. So, Goodfellas, if anything, was good for drawing back the curtain on how the seedy world of Italian mobs worked."

","""Goodfellas"" (1990) is a crime drama masterpiece. The film is from the perspective of Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta, as he rises through the Italian Mob. His Jewish-Italian heritage may not allow him to become a Made Man, but his drive and puts him in position to be the right-hand man of Mob Boss, Paul ""Paulie"" Cicero, played by Paul Survino. His eventual partners James Conway, played by Robert De Niro, and Tommy DeVito, played by Joe Pesci, may have bigger plans than just being a right hand. Martin Scorsese paces this film as if the viewer has been implanted into the film. Through his pacing, he helps the audience feel what it would be like in a crime family. Times where you would anticipate fast paced action, he provides a calm similar to a professional hit. While other times, if the situation is out of control, he makes you feel like its out of control through his timing. <br/><br/>The point of this film can flow in any direction depending on the viewers interpretation. Since the film is based on a true story, Scorsese may have wanted to simply tell an enlightened story of Henry Hill. I believe the film is a heavy hitting look inside a crime family. The payoff was unexpected in relation to the knowledge of certain characters. Depending on the viewers personal morals, the payoff is magically all over the place. The viewer may even be torn, like myself, who believes in honor and justice equally. This film should be on everyone's watch list. ""Goodfellas"" is the gold standard."

","This quote opens the movie, based on the true story of Henry Hill, who came from an half irish and half italian family that lived in a bad neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, in 1955. Since his boyhood he has always been fascinated from the mafia life, a life of power, brightness and murderers. He will find in Pauly Cicero and his organisation the family he always desired, a family of good guys, 'Goodfellas', as they loved to call themselves, but behind that term there is a world full of violence that Scorsese manages to tell us in a masterly way, as the violence grows with the age of the main character, who in the end will have to choose one between his two family. Not only a good movie, as his title may suggest, but a Masterpiece of the gangster movies, Goodfellas is in fact a dramatic story that becomes absolut enterteinement to the audience, without never suounding banal, with a fantastic soundtrack, which can count on great tracks like 'Il cielo in una stanza', an italian song by Mina, and the presence of brilliant actors like Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci (who won an oscar for playing the role of Tommy DeVito) and last but not least Robert De Niro, who needs no words to be described.

","Goodfellas is one of the best crime movies of all time as I would rank it up there with The Godfather, even though the two are hars to compare. Scorsese's directing style is really what makes the film, with multiple long takes and the use of Scorsese's masterful framing, we feel what it is like to be a gangster. The perfromances are impeccable, with Deniro, Pesci, and Liotta giving some of the best perfroamces of the 90's. The story is incredibly well told and the fact that it is based off of a true story only makes it more interesting. I enjoy the narration done by Henry Hill and his wife Karen, as it gives us an inside look of what is going on in the characters' heads. The film shows the harshness of the mafia yet still manages to be funny in one of the best crime films ever made."

","This film is, to me, one of the best mob films. In my mind, it outperforms Godfather(1972) and top all of Mafia films except Infernal Affairs(2002), which is too often classified into ""Cops & Robbers movies"" by me. By the way, Infernal Affairs is later on adapted for a new American one, named The Departed(2006), which is, to me, one of the worst films partly because I find it that there is a inconsistency between the original and the remake. And the main reason I dislike The Departed(2006) is, I think, the original is so perfect that any remake that attempt to pay homage to it would be disgraceful. <br/><br/>Let's get down to Goodfellas (1990). In comparison with those remakes and fictional stories, Goodfellas is real, of course real because, after all, it is based on a real story. I know, Godfather is regard as one of the greatest films throughout the film history, but it is just make up by a genius, who creates it by making some interviews, intergrating some stories heard from others; while Goodfellas is a wise-guy's life, real life. I love Godfather for sure, and I believe everyone loves it too, as we love romantic legend and epic mythology. However, those stories are far away from us. Goodfellas is more human, less romanticized. I believe few people, as a gangster, could lead a life portrayed by Godfather. Most of us are boorish goodfellas, or wise-guys. That's why I insist that Goodfellas be better than Godfather. After all, we cannot deny ourselves. <br/><br/>Speak of the cast of this film, I was familiar with Henry at the first sight of him. I must have seen him before, I knew it. It took pains for me to recall which film he showed up in. At long last, I got a hunch that he supposed to star in Hannibal Lector series, so I got through the cast list of Hannibal trilogy. And Sure enough, he did. He is the one who wants to arrest Hannibal but fails and be one of the toys that Hannibal plays with. Until now, I can clearly, crystal clearly, remember the bloody disgusting scene that in Hannibal (2001), he (starred by Ray Liotta) is probably hypnotized and Hannibal opens his skull, gets a piece of meat out of his brain, and ...... too disgusting to describe furthermore. And he (Ray Liotta) is the narrator and protagonist of Goodfellas. That interests me. From a puppet manipulated by a puppeteer to the narrator and protagonist of Goodfellas. While watching the mob lifestyle in Goodfellas that borders on the ridiculous, his face always reminds me of the fact that he once shows up in other film and be grinded down by someone sinister. And it gives added zest to my pleasure.<br/><br/>Tommy(Joe Pesci) is impressive in the film. He does everything big, regardless of outcome. And it makes the film never become a snooze fest. As long as he is in that scene, you always expect something exciting happen, and he always live up to your expectation. With him, there is an unpredictability in the film. I guess that's why everybody considers it a pity when he is whacked by Mafia despite the fact that he is such a rude guy. Come on, the film is not a solemn moral lesson. Joe Pesci is awesome. No wonder he wins an Oscar. He totally deserves it. <br/><br/>Basically, the whole film consists of many fragments of daily life, including eating, drinking, sex, party, robbery, fest and what not. Nevertheless, every fragments are interesting enough to keep you focus on the film, and even immerse yourself in being the part of Henry's special life. Colorful, literally and metaphorically, life. A great deal of lively moving shoots, as well as a bunch of classic 60's and 70's Rock 'n Roll music, make the film, despite the long running time, full of energy from start to finish."

","Often considered as the best Martin Scorcese Movie, even out trumping Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980) and The Departed (2005), ""Goodfellas"" is a highly acclaimed film and regarded as one of the best Mafia/Crime/Mob/Gangster films of all time.<br/><br/>Basically, the story is about Henry Hill, telling his life story. Growing up in a tough neighborhood, being addicted to the compelling life of the American Mafia, Slowly but surely integrating into this Gangster World and covering his relationship with his wife Karen Hill and his two best friends and mob partners Jimmy and Tommy.
It's no tale about honor or morality. It's a story so cruel, grim and tough that some scenes are hard to watch. But that's just how it is in the Mafia World. 
Especially Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) is a complete maniac, a psychopath in his own right and his screen time always delivers in evil fashion.
As the storyline continues we find out more about how deep related the Mafia World truly is and in some way, how a kid like Henry (unfortunately) can get addicted and fascinated by the way of living. In fact, nearly the complete first hour just shows the 'advantages' of being in the mafia. The murder scenes are disturbing, even frightening and the high use of profanity assists this.
Always brutal, Sometimes even ugly, it is directed excellently by Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>What makes Goodfellas so great are definitely the standout performances. The acting is superb and the embodiment of each character fits perfectly.
Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro and Lorraine Bracco; But who truly stands out is Ray Liotta. The voice over and the scenery comes together exactly in the right moment, and the delivery of each actor is brilliant. 
Because of the great acting there are so many hilariously funny and memorable scenes. The ""I amuse you?"" scene in the casino or when Tommy, Henry & Jimmy want to explain why Tommy's shirt is full of blood to Tommy's mother are outrageously funny. The high use of violence, brutality and black humor isn't always easy to watch (when Tommy starts shooting at the waiter) but the standout performances make the story just so gripping and compelling.<br/><br/>So, Is ""Goodfellas"" flawless?
Actually, No.
The difference between ""Goodfellas"" and (considered the best movie of the genre) ""The Godfather"" is, that 1972's crime drama will take a straight up evil and bad man, and make him look human. That's just missing here. There are some tiny approaches of making Henry look human, but they just aren't as well executed as they should have been. In some way, unstable people may be disturbed by the glorification of the Mafia because in fact, there is no-one really to cheer for in ""Goodfellas"".<br/><br/>Except for this remark, I think ""Goodfellas"" is a brilliant movie, that perfectly captures the cruelty of the Mafia with standout performances by Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci, beautiful directing and a compelling storyline. 9/10"

","As entertainment goes this delivers mainly because we are allowed to visit with a life style that amuses and triggers the imaginations and causes the viewer to enter into this world portrayed on screen if they so choose as some movies have the ability to pull you into to them. This be one of them. From growing up at a young age around action and intrigue to entering into bigger than life situations this movie tells it well. However, when one takes a second closer look for reality sake we find that lying, cheating, stealing and killing makes for a poor excuse of a life and no amount of glorifying can help that. They often refer to this world as the underworld being dark and not fit to be lived in the light. That's why people in this world hang out together as no one else could tolerate them. In the end, we find they couldn't tolerate each other also. Enjoy the actors in this film who portray this lifestyle very well and the director who make it special.

","I normally don't like movies that portray Italian immigrants as gangsters, but this movie was an exception. Don't get me wrong, I love a good pizza pie just as much as anyone else. And this movie did a pretty job of embracing Italian cuisine while not playing up business suits too much. So, that's good.
Joe Pesci's character is good because he loves his mother. Maybe they could have had more construction workers in it, like with the Sopranos- would have been too much like Grand Theft Auto though. That is probably the appeal of the movie. It focuses more on the family... ha, ha, ha. I like how Paulie never rides in a car, but will still use a phone. Watch the movie to find out how they are able to make a quick buck in America while avoiding the authorities."

","Goodfellas (1990) is a major work of high cinema art. The best of the best in all ways! When the history of Western Art is written in the future, cinema will be included as a true and important art form along with painting and sculpture. Martin Scorcese will be ranked with his fellow artists of Italian descent, Michaelangelo and Leonardo DiVinci as one of the great artists of Western art history. Scorcese is a hero and a superstar in the world and history of art. No doubt about it.<br/><br/>The Goodfellas (1990) movie is ranked as the #2 best gangster theme of all time by the American Film Institute (AFI), as one of the top 100 best films of all time by the same organization, and included on the USA Federal Government's Library Of Congress National Film Registry List of best USA movies every produced.<br/><br/>The movie is about a 25 year span in the life of New York City born Henry Hill (Irish father, Italian mother, raised in 1940's and 1950's Queens, New York City) starting with his teen aged years in 1955 when he first joined an Italian organized crime group as a beginner errand boy for the mob, and continuing to 1980 when Henry Hill's 25 year history as a member of the Luchessi (NYC NY USA) crime family ended after Henry Hill agreed to become and FBI/ USA Federal Government prosecution witness against his fellow Luchessi crime family members (50 of whom were convicted and imprisoned as a result of Hienry Hill's 1980 turncoat testimony................Hill was then put into a Federal Government ""witness protection program"" from which he was evicted after the Goodfellas 1990 movie was released, and Hill got involved in mass media publicity activity connected with the movie which was based on his Wiseguy book (written by author Nicholas Pillagi) chraracter).<br/><br/>The beautifully filmed and written movie appears to be a near documentary describing the crime world in New York City Henry Hill lived in and participated in until he was arrested for illegal drug activity in 1980, and ""flipped"" ........ he agreed to testify against his long time friends and fellow criminals..........to avoid certain long term incarceration).<br/><br/>The statistics about this movie (reported in the WWW.IMDb.Com ""Trivia"" section of the IMDb.Com page devoted to Goodfellas 1990) are daunting.<br/><br/>The ""F"" word was used during the film many hundreds of times, and held the record for the use of that famous but historically avoided word (in the movies) at the time the movie was released (the record was later broken, we are informed!).<br/><br/>42 different songs were used to support the sound track of the movie.<br/><br/>The Sopranos (1999 - 2006) series TV gangster theme program (voted the best written dramatic TV series in TV history by the Writers Guild Of America) is largely based on story telling and structural approach used in Goodfellas (1990). Goodfellas (1990) lead actress Lorainne Bracco also appeared in the Sopranos (1999 - 2006) TV series as Tony Soprano's lady psychiatrist.<br/><br/>One of the minor actors in Goodfellas (1990) was a former New York City police officer whose father and other relatives had actually been in the Mafia. Eppolito wrote a best selling book about his life titled Mafia Cop, and was later convicted and jailed for murder and other crimes several years after the filming of Goodfellas (1990).<br/><br/>The Goodfellas (1990) movie was based on a 1980's book titled Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pillagi (author of Serpico, also about New York City Italians involved in crime............husband of famous book and movie writer Nora Ephron). The book was based on extensive interviews with Henry Hill, and some editions of the Wiseguy (1986) book credited Henry Hill as the book author.<br/><br/>A documentary titled The Real Goodfella (2006 UK) was produced about Henry Hill, and Hill himself appeared in the documentary which included his account of his part in the production of Goodfellas (1990).<br/><br/>Hill died in 2012. He served time in prison during his 1955 - 1980 time as a Mafie associate criminal, and also again after he entered the Federal Government Witness Protection Program after he was arrested and convicted for drug crimes. He served a total of 14 years in prison. He was kicked out of the Witness Protection Program in 1991 as a result of his participation in Goodfellas (1990) movie publicity and his efforts to make himself a public celebrity made famous by that movie and the book Wiseguy. He survived another 21 years after leaving Federal Government protection until his 2012 death. He was paid more than half a million dollars for his part and contribution to the making of the Goodfellas (1990) movie. He lived and died in open prosperity and was never attacked or harmed by presumably vengeful former associates from the Mafia.<br/><br/>Henry Hill's life after 1980 in the US Federal Government Witness Protection Program was presented and treated in comic form in a second movie about him titled My Blue Heaven (1991) written by Wisseguy author's book author and movie script writer wife of fame, Nora Ephron. Ephron wass famous for her comedy book writing (she wrote best seller Crazy Salad in the early 1970's) and comedy movie script writing (she wrote When Harry Met Sally 1988 starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan).<br/><br/>The Goodfellas (1990) movie describes the famous Lufthansa Aircraft Heist of 1978, one of the largest robberies in USA history. That robbery was the subject of a movie titled The 10 Million Dollar Getaway, and included several cast members who acted in Goodfellas (1990).<br/><br/>Goodfellas (1990) is by any measure an astonishing and worthy movie.<br/><br/>It is a portrait of urban America in the mid-20th Century.<br/><br/>Used copies of the movie can be purchased from Amazon.Com for tiny money (less than $5 as of 2017). <br/><br/>This movie is worth study and re-screening often. It is a highwater mark of USA cinema.

","This movie is held up as one of the great Mafia movies of all time, and for good reason. Over the course of the film, we are the shown the Mafia lifestyle through the eyes of our narrator, Henry Hill. Our other main characters are Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway, Henry's mob partners who often show the more gruesome parts of Mafia dealings. Ray Liotta (Henry), Joe Pesci (Tommy), and Jimmy (Robert De Niro) bring in brilliant performances that makes truly invested in these characters and makes them feel more than simply actors within the film.<br/><br/>The plot of the film follows Henry through his childhood through to his adult life and his associations with the Mafia. This film does a fantastic job at first sucking the viewer in to the sense that the mafia isn't so bad as we see the mobsters accepting Henry as their own and their seemingly affable nature, which can be seen especially in Jimmy. As Henry grows up however the audience begins to see the more violent and amoral dealings of the Mafia that shatter the image of the romantic life that was presented at the beginning as well as other portrayals of Mafia in the media.<br/><br/>Something that also has to be mentioned is Martin Scorsese's use of music and sound within the film. Music within the film helps to both capture the time period of the 50's all the way through to the 70's as well as relate to the situation at hand. It gives the film a good rhythm and pace that makes each scene interesting to watch and flows easily into one another, leaving you on the edge of your seat as it makes the two and a half hour run-time feel short as every minute engrosses you into the reality of the film. <br/><br/>Overall, a quintessential film for any fan of Mafia movies or film buffs, as well as one of the best films to introduce you to Scorsese's work."

","The movie Goodfellas really left a good impression. The story line took me in and everything that happened felt like it was real life, even though I'm not Italian and I don't live in 1990. Since the story happened in real life it is 100% understandable. The action, the romance and the thrill combined give this movie a perfect taste of everything that is supposed to be in an action movie. The life of a gangster is put in the spotlight and is viewed from multiple angles, even from the negative angle. I can recommend this movie to anyone who has interest in action and crime movies. To people who haven't watched a lot of movies from those genres I would recommend to watch Goodfellas as one of your first crime movies. Other movies that are similar to Goodfellas are The Godfather, Paid in Full and Casino. To conclude my review I will sum everything up.

","As far back as I can remember, this has been one of my favourite movies. This is a brutally honest and authentic depiction of the Mafia in New York and how they got their fingers in every pie available. The story is told mainly through the eyes of Henry Hill, who we see go from impressionable child to career criminal and finally a beleaguered nervous wreck. Ray Liotta turns in his best performance in the role, Joe Pesci likewise as Tommy DeVito is brilliant in his genuinely terrifying performance of the unstable and merciless mobster. Robert De Niro, although not as psychotic is just as ruthless and frightening in his part as Jimmy Conway, the mob enforcer who could easily be shaking your hand one minute, then shooting you in the head the next, as shown when he has most of the crew who helped in the Lufthansa heist murdered without so much a second thought. The rest of the cast are also brilliant particularly Lorraine Bracco as the impressionable wife of the mobster who finds herself at first attracted by the life and then terrified of it, and Paul Sorvino as the ultimate Mob boss who can bring people into line with just a look. Special mention for Frank Vincent, who, although not in the movie for very long turns in a memorable performance as Billy Batts whose arrogance would end up costing him dear. Goodfellas shows every aspect of the life of a mobster, including its dark and ugly side which shows how high the price can be for the perceived glamorous lifestyle, so I don't agree with the train of thought that it glamorizes organised crime, and its depiction of the lifestyle is feels very real and authentic. This movie is a definitive movie of the ages and one of the best ever made."

","It's the original, full-length music video. To me, the way Scorsese features the music as a main character truly keeps me coming back year after year.

There's a shamanistic quality to that skill.

Let's talk first about the film script that tells the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a boy who always wanted to be a gangster, here we have a complete narrative of his life, from the rise to the fall, through his dramas, love, death , Disagreements and glare. We do not have here a highly organized Italian mafia, our characters are not the ""Bosses"", quite the contrary, their criminal life begins with robberies and ends with traffic, their operations are well explained, such as the development of all characters, even characters Like that of Paulie who has little screen time are well developed. The photograph of the film is good, it is not memorable, but it knows how to play colors very well on screen, we do not have that dark palette as it is usually the mafia movies, here the color palette is warm, the warm weather is always present and the trail Sound is spectacular, nothing original tracks, only songs from the time when the film is passing, that passes all that sarcastic climate is counterpoint to what is being shown on screen, it is also worth mentioning the great editing and sound mixing Of the film. Joe pesci is one of the best supporting actors in the cinema, and he is completely incredible, and it's good that Scorsese did not manage to play the leading role for De niro - who does a sober and convincing performance - but for Ray Liotta, That in certain moments is even alien to the personage, but in the great part of the film delivers a mafioso very cunning, intelligent and even unconcerned with the world and its consequences. At the end of the day we have a movie that keeps its rhythm and the high level in all the acts, it is not completely perfect and not a masterpiece of the seventh art, but surely it is a spectacular movie."

","There's much to say about Goodfellas, and most of it has already been said by others. What I enjoyed the most with the movie was how it constructs this dual reality. You see and hear all of these guys having a blast, enjoying their money and their power. You can hear Liotta's character describing the joys of the life they led. At the same time you are presented with certain scenes from this life where you can also see the backside of the medal. Many mob movies are like this. They show this really charming culture of, well, people celebrating their own importance, and a culture based on respect, tradition and hierarchy. But then you typically see it all falls apart, so it wasn't a good idea after all. This movie plays around a bit with this, showing you both sides of the medal from the get go, but as the story progresses you can gradually see the medal turning around, going from having the positive side in focus, to having the negative side in focus. But, as mentioned, both sides of the medal are visible from the start till the end. This is maybe the most obvious in the ending scenes, with how the narration relates to what you see."

","Martin Scorsese's films are a movie historian creating his perfect movies. Unlike Quentin Tarantino who simply adapts his films to what he thinks would effect him the most if he was just an audience member. One of the original bad boys of cinema creates absolutely sweltering narratives that makes the filmmakers brilliant storyteller. With a editing style that is more like a long montage, then a feature film. The inner-monologue he uses, and has used in Wolf of Wall Street, The Departed, Gangs of New York makes utter sense in telling these confessions of... stories that are familiarizing the life of a mob with an audience who are not familiar with stashing dead rats in ice boxes or being a made men. Its almost genius. <br/><br/>The more you watch - the more familiar it gets - the more funny it gets. By the end, even the nastiest moment is hilarious. I don't see Goodfellas as his best film, maybe for some of the outstanding cast, but it has stuck in a stigma to the average movie goer for the longest time. And it will eventually be his most revered and appreciated Crime film in decades to come. Like Orsen Welles' Third Man or Kubrick's Space Odyssey; it will overpass his other filmography. Its an entertaining film, funny as Wolf of Wall Street, while as thrilling as Cape Fear."

","Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" is the true story about Henry Hill, and his 30 years in the mafia. Lets be straight. I have seen a lot of different movies through my time, good and bad, touching or disgusting, but this one takes the price. It's safe to say that this incredibly well directed and well played movie is my personal favourite.<br/><br/>Starting from the beginning, we se three guys, that is Henry and his two friends, driving a car on the highway in the middle of the night. Seems first like any other trip, but suddenly there is a strange noise coming from the car, and Henry turns to his friends. At first they all seem uncertain, but when they pull over, they all know where the sound is coming from, the trunk. We now witness the first of many coming violent scenes, as this is when they finish the job of getting rid of a mob-boss that they got in an argument with. <br/><br/>After the brutal killing act, we get thrown into the magical but yet horrifying world of the mafia, and Henry Hill, played by the actor Ray Liotta, starts to tell his story. We start in the 50's, how Henry first got connected, and then the whole movie follows his career through out the years. We witness the ups and downs of being a wiseguy, someone in the mafia.<br/><br/>I think what I most like about ""Goodfellas"" is that Henry is narrating throughout the movie. That is a concept I am very weak for when they use in movies, because it feels like you are in the movie with the main character, and that he in some way is communicating to you, It increases your connection and helps you to bond and feel sympathy for the character, no matter what kind of person he is. <br/><br/>Throughout the whole movie, no matter what he does, Henry has my sympathy and I route for him. I want him to succeed and don't care about the others. Because he briefly manages to convince you that life in the mafia is something glorious, that you have power, money, and respect, and you almost fall for it, The first half of the movie Scorcese puts in flashy 50's and 60's music, and creates a world of luxury built up by corruption and violence, but everything has its price. <br/><br/>Goodfellas is actually based on a true story. Almost everything in the movie has happened, and it is shocking to se how all the characters are willing to cross all lines in order to establish the kind of world and lifestyle that they want. Henry and his friends are willing to stop at nothing to get what they want, and that is also a point that Henry makes us very clear with in the beginning, that you take what you want in the mafia. It is a very tempting idea at first, but when you ask yourself truly what that really means, its like you wake up from a dream and realise what in gods name you are thinking. <br/><br/>Every scene is well made, and Scorcese uses his well developed directing skills as he captures the perfect moments. A lot of scenes illustrates a flashy and fun part of being in the mafia, while other scenes later in the movie breaks the good image and gives you the chills. Often when someone later on becomes hurt, but the best part is when you anticipate something, and it turns out totally different. <br/><br/>Every character has a different fate in this movie.<br/><br/>Its also safe to say that Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci manages to capture their roles outstandingly good, along with Ray Liotta. There are a lot of powerful scenes and great acting and integrating between the characters. They are so well played that you would not be surprised if any of them had a mysterious and haunted background. I have to mention the scene where Liotta and Pesci integrate, at a restaurant, and Pesci manages to fool not only the audience, but also Liotta himself and the people around them. Everyone thinks for a moment that Liotta is dead meat and and that he has isolated the short tempered Pesci. Outstanding. The scene was also improvised. <br/><br/>Until the very end, Goodfellas stays at the same level of perfection. I can only hope that that this will always remain among the most watched movies, and that everyone sees this at least once. Because it is vital to ask yourself, what am I willing to do for money and power, and what price would I be willing to pay?"

But not only is he great, but his supporting cast may be even greater, seeing as Joe Pesci won best actor in a supporting role at the Oscars a decade-and-a-half ago. This is also a great example of a kid who grows up into the wrong crowd to eventually make his way out, realizing his moral mistakes.

","Goodfellas is a milestone film in that regard because just as Public Enemy and Little Caesar defined it in the Thirties, The Godfather trilogy in the seventies and eighties, Goodfellas set the standard that all other films including Martin Scorsese similar Casino try to meet. The interesting thing is that Martin Scorsese is young enough to redefine it again with another work.<br/><br/>With Ray Liotta narrating his own life in crime in a flashback as real life criminal Henry Hill, Martin Scorsese offers us one fascinating glimpse of the criminal life in the Eisenhower to Reagan era. Henry Hill even as a child got sucked into the criminal life as a kid, as he said all he ever wanted to be was a gangster. Tutored by both Robert DeNiro and Paul Sorvino, Liotta takes part in one of the biggest heists of all time of Lufthansa Airlines at JFK Airport during the seventies. Goodfellas is the story of the events from Henry Hill's perspective leading up to the heist and the aftermath.<br/><br/>For myself I've never seen the gangster mentality better expressed on screen except maybe by Sean Connery in Family Business. Liotta and Connery operate from the same mindset. If you work hard and hope it pays off in success, you're a dope. If you want something, just take it. When you come right down to it, that's how criminals think, it's the rest of us who are fools.<br/><br/>Goodfellas was nominated for several Oscars, but came away with only one winner, Joe Pesci in the role of crazy Tommy DeVito. He's another criminal type, one who's driven by a terrible inferiority complex due to his short stature and does terrible things even to his own peers. And those peers don't forget as you see what happens to Pesci in Goodfellas. This turned out to be a career role for Pesci. He's a multi-talented man who's got an incredible range and can play everything from the Home Alone comedies to stone killers like here in Goodfellas or in Casino."

"torbec01","9","0","0","17 March 2015"," Great gangster film
","Goodfellas is definitely one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen. Martin Scorsese directed this film perfectly with a pistol whipping cast. This film is based on a true story about Henry Hill, and how he strives from a kid to an adult to be a gangster in the life of the Italian mafia. The film is set between 1955 and the late 1970's in East New York, Brooklyn. <br/><br/>The cast is filled with some of the biggest stars of the early nineties. Including Ray Liotta, who played the main character Henry Hill. Along with Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, also known as Jimmy ""the gem"", and Joe Pesci who played Tommy DeVito. These actors do an outstanding job on screen of portraying the classic gangster theme. I could not be distracted throughout watching this film. It literally sucked me into the story. <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese did an outstanding job with the cast, production, music, and the story of the gangster life in New York. Henry Hill wanted to be a gangster since he was a kid. Watching the gangsters around the neighborhood, he desired more and more to be like them. He was intrigued from the start and wanted a life of no limits. Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy were a great trio of hardcore gangsters who demanded respect and didn't take crap from anyone. <br/><br/>The film is full of countless gangsters with a great script and superb music and sound. The soundtrack really pulled me into the era of the 60's and 70's. The costumes and clothes were done very well. The costume and makeup design mirrored the era very well. The film also had a great amount of gangster crime and violence that kept my attention the whole time. <br/><br/>The lighting in the film was mostly dark. Some of these scenes were in a club and bars so it matched perfectly for a gangster setting. Scorsese also did well during a scene where the trio was digging up an old friend and the lighting was dark and foggy. The lighting in this scene also had a red tint to it. Another great scene was a classic slow motion up close shooting by tommy DeVito. You can see each empty shell fly out of the pistol in slow motion. The communication of the brutal violence of the mafia was well received. <br/><br/>Overall, the film had every element of the gangster life. The film told the story very well and kept me entertained as much as when I was watching The Godfather. Both are classic gangster films that will never be forgotten for years to come."
"dholliday-imdb","9","0","0","7 March 2015"," as good as people say it is
","Goodfellas has a solid case of being Scorsese's finest work, and considering his iconic filmography, that's a huge ask.<br/><br/>It not only offers career-defining performances from Liotta and Pesci, it also gave us the ultimate De Niro hardcore gangster, the stuff his legend is made of. With Scorsese in scintillating form, the famous restaurant one-shot is one of many intoxicating scenes, we get an epic story spanning decades, and most importantly for such a genre film, it's absolutely coherent.<br/><br/>Italio/Latino-Gangster movies often exist within themselves, and while Goodfellas doesn't transcend its genre as a work of art (like Coppolas' Godfather 1/2 arguably does) it's so expertly-executed that it must sit right at the top of this particular genre-tree."
"Gideon24","9","0","0","6 March 2015"," For my money, Martin Scorsese's Best Film
","Movies about the mob have been part of cinema history for decades, but never was life as a mobster made to look more glamorous and more alluring than it was presented in Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpiece Goodfellas, a sweeping cinematic epic that spans several decades in the lives of a select group of men working their way up through the social strata of the syndicate.<br/><br/>The film opens on the childhood of one Henry Hill (a real person BTW, who is now in the Witness Protection Program), a teen who started his career with the mob as an errand boy and was paid handsomely for his efforts. It's a little unsettling the way the mob draws Henry in and makes what he does seem so glamorous and exciting, but Nicholas Pileggi's screenplay brilliantly shines light on the allure of life in the mob. Even though we know it's wrong, the way the director and screenwriter make it completely understandable. There's something rather pathetic about the fact that when a teenage Henry is arrested for the first time, the fact that he keeps his mouth shut about his employers, makes him the new hero of this dangerous inner circle and that he will be protected by them for life.<br/><br/>The inner circle includes a couple of career mobsters Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) who take the adult Henry (now played by Ray Liotta) under their wing and the sometimes conflicted emotions Henry goes through when he realizes some of the things that are required of him. The movie's opening is proof of this as we see Jimmy, Tommy, and Henry in a car with a body in a trunk which they are preparing to bury somewhere in New Jersey. Despite the rampant ugliness that is a part of this life, the perks seem to outweigh the ugliness for Henry until he is in so deep that he can't get out, to the point where his job has direct correlations to the Don, Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) who treats Henry like a son until he learns that Henry has branched out into his own side business that has threatened the primary business and everyone involved.<br/><br/>Scorcese has created a world that looks impossible to resist and it is very easy to understand how Hill got pulled in, and as we all know, once you're in, you never get out. Eventually, Henry was in so much trouble, his only alternative to being whacked was selling out.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely perfect, led by De Niro as Conway and a star- making performance by Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. Liotta is sexy and charismatic as Hill and no matter what Hill does, Liotta always makes the viewer sympathize with Henry, no matter what he's going through. Joe Pesci won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his outrageous performance as Tommy, which produces equal doses of laughs and chills, whether he is amusing cronies with wild stories, beating the crap out of old buddies, or borrowing a shovel from his clueless mom to help bury a body in the trunk of his car while he is at mom's dinner table eating pasta. Lorraine Braco received a supporting actress nomination for her fiery performance as Karen, Henry's wife who turns a blind eye to what her husband is doing because the perks for her seem to be even better than the perks Henry gets. Paul Sorvino commands the screen as Big Paulie and Catherine Scorsese (the director's mother) is adorable as Tommy's mother.<br/><br/>Scorsese's cinematic eye for violence and shock is in full view here, creating a glamorous look at mob life that doesn't minimize the violence and ugliness that comes along with it. The art direction and divine musical score also deserve mention here. The film and Scorsese were both robbed of Oscars...in a word, a masterpiece."
"sharky_55","10","0","0","6 February 2015"," Better than being President of the United States
","There is neither glorification or criticism of the gangster lifestyle in Scorsese's Goodfellas, despite the opening lines of Henry Hill's narration. At times it can seem almost alluring and seductive. Take the character of Karen for example, played excellently by Lorraine Bracco. One can pinpoint the approximate moment in which she becomes swept up in the lifestyle of Henry (Ray Liotta), right when she decides to hide a bloodied gun rather than go to the police as ""other girlfriends"" would do. Her voice-over from her first appearance is one of the film's only real insights into Henry's world from the outside world. From then on it's a slow process as she is swallowed into her husband's life. Some of it is subtle, like the line about the bag of money at the wedding and how no one would dare steal from the Mafia. In other instances she's shocked at what she's gotten into as we wake to see an extreme close up of a gun barrel pointed directly at the camera before she breaks down and realises she cannot do the deed. <br/><br/>One of the film's pivotal and most famous scenes is the long tracking shot that takes us through one of Henry and Karen's first dates. They bypass the waiting queue for a nightclub, entering via the service corridors and travel through the kitchen and right up to the stage where they immediately are presented with front row seats and a table. The magic of this shot as Henry greets acquaintance after acquaintance illustrates the lavish lifestyle and prestige of his position even at a young age, and seduces us like it seduces Karen. In a similar scene, we are presented with Henry's POV as the long take and voice-over narration combine seamlessly to introduce us to Mafia members in a bar. The camera-work is slow, deliberate and precise; each member is hinted at being their own fleshed out persona, each with their own powers and lives, yet for Henry it's a very familiar process. <br/><br/>The select few Mafia members that are shown to be in close correspondence to Henry are Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy (Robert De Niro), the three of them taking care of business in the opening scene. The ease in which the violence and brutality of their work slips between their mundane lives humanises and establishes the main characters as a family. One moment they are finishing off a murder and digging a hole for the body, the next they are having a meal with Tommy's mother. The opening of the film sharply paints a contrast when it is later revealed what they have done and where exactly they got the knife from. Compare the harsh ominous red lighting of the digging scene to the naturally calm dinner with Tommy's mother. The film's dialogue also makes similar comparisons which highlight the notion of family. There's a brief moment of tension between Tommy and Henry who comments on his ""funny"" nature, the same comment later mirrored as Tommy takes offense to Billy Batt's ball bustering. One ends in laughter, the other murder.<br/><br/>Even in prison, a usually dark and dismal location, their ties are are strong as ever. They live like kings inside, getting regular shipments of fine gourmet food from bribed guards: bread, salami, prosciutto, cheese, scotch, wine. It's arguable one of the film's calmest moments, the soft jazz vocals of Bobby Darin's Beyond the Sea accompany the scene as the four sit down and dine on better food than many on the outside can afford. It's just one of the many perfect choices of music Scorsese uses to add information and mood to the film. Later, as Jimmy begins to cut ties and whack the people involved in the Lufthansa heist, the heavy and bitter-sweet chords of Layla's piano segment signal the beginning of the end. Scorsese's use of freeze frames at vital points of Henry's journey, and the imposing dolly zoom near the end of his mafia life add additional subtext. <br/><br/>Goodfellas covers a great deal of time from the early deliveries of a young Henry, to his marriage and rise up the gang, to the 4 years he spends in prison and the growing up of his kids. So it's a little jarring as a sequence near the end depicts a whole day of his life and responsibility. Gone are the long and graceful shots of his luxurious lifestyle. His hair is not slicked to the side and his face shows visible signs of ageing and of course drug abuse, which leads the audience and even Karen to believe his paranoia is from that source. It's a very stylish and frenetic sequence; the edits seem to jump quicker and between locations at a moment's notice, the narration of Henry is suddenly a tiny bit faster and there's almost a slight fisheye lens effect as we slowly close into his character. The walls of the frame seem to squeeze Henry as he rushes from chore to chore; gun deals, snorting cocaine, another gun deal, check on the sauce, mix the cocaine, check on the sauce again. Work and life mixes together as Henry struggles to maintain his standard of living he has become so accustomed to. <br/><br/>The sentiment is echoed most prominently in the end. Henry gets up from the witness stand, walk across the courtroom and breaks the 4th wall as he directly narrates to the camera; ""I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook."" It's the high highs and the low lows of the gangster lifestyle that he craves even in the relative safety of the witness protection program. His comment on ordering spaghetti and getting egg noodles with ketchup is particularly telling: even in prison he ate much better and it's exactly in that world where he feels most comfortable. For that, Henry would do it all over again."

It's not hard to see why Goodfellas is such a critically acclaimed movie and still a very popular movie amongst film fans.<br/><br/>Based on the non-fiction novel Wise Guy by Nicholas Pileggi (who also wrote the screenplay along with Martin Scorsese, Goodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta who puts in an explosive performance in his best role to date) and his rise and fall in his career with the mafia throughout the 1950's and the 1980's. He starts off as a young boy running errands and as time goes on, he earns his reputation as a feared gangster however such acts including adultery, murder, and drug use contribute to his downfall. His fellow friends and gangsters throughout his time in the mafia include his childhood friend the sociopath Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci who deservedly won the 1990 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor) and the slick, calculating and volatile Jimmy Conway who also enjoys hijacking and robbing trucks (Robert De Niro in another memorable performance). The mob boss is Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino), a man who commands respect and fear, and rules over the crime family with an iron first including Henry Hill, Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway. Henry Hill's wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco, well known as the psychologist Dr Jennifer Melfi from The Sopranos) finds herself seduced by her husband's glamorous lifestyle but nothing lasts forever when Henry's criminal activities and behaviour impede into their personal lives.<br/><br/>Without question this is Martin Scorsese's finest movie. There's not one bad thing that can be said about this movie. The cast is first rate, the entire story and screenplay is excellent, and Martin Scorsese as the director does a very commendable job. Throughout the entire 146 minutes, there is not a dull moment nor is there a minute wasted. There are endless classic scenes in Goodfellas that I could not even start to list them. The clever use of the soundtrack with all the songs intertwined with many scenes from the movie makes Goodfellas even more memorable at another level. Every time I hear the piano exit from Layla by Derek and The Dominos, I am instantly reminded of Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is a movie with a reputation for being violent with 300 uses of the f... word. In no way does Martin Scorsese pull any punches, nor does he aim to glamorise life in the mafia or the criminal lifestyle. The violence is realistic, cold, and unflinching, and this is certainly not a movie for everyone.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Goodfellas was unfairly robbed of many Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director among others. Though Martin Scorsese finally earns a long overdue Academy Award for The Departed in 2006, he deserved to win Best Director for Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Goodfellas earns its spot as one of the finest movies of all time, and is definitely one of my favourite movies that will never soon be forgotten.<br/><br/>A well deserved 10/10"

","Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco... No need to elaborate any further... Great movie inspired by the life of Henry Hill. Great story told by one of the best film makers is history of a young kid who grew up surrounded by mobsters, crocks & thieves...or as they called them back then... Goodfellas. De Niro's portrayal of James Conway or James Burke in real life, although been toned down by much, is absolutely genius. It is important to note that although Henry Hill was in the mafia he was only the associate, as ""made men"" (full time mafioso) could be only those who are, or can be proved to be of Sicilian origin. I would like to mention a phenomenal Joe Pesci performance playing Tommy DeVito or Thomas DeSimone is real life, who was also a Lucchese crime family associate, much like Henry Hill. Don't want to go into the detail as this movie really doesn't need any introduction, just go a head and see it for your self!"

","GOODFELLAS is almost 25 years old, but I don't think there's been a better mob movie since. This movie does a terrific job showing the flash and allure of being a successful mobster (the cash, the respect, the twisted sense of family) and then the dark and dirty side - the graft, lies and ferocity. Liotta's fall is as rough as his rise is seductively entertaining (think SCARFACE, only a whole lot better) and it's punctuated by brutal acts of violence.<br/><br/>Overall, a great movie; features an immersive soundtrack, half the supporting cast of THE SOPRANOS, and Lorraine Bracco, who just radiates sassy broad. And lest I sinfully forget: Joe Pesci, whose savage hothead character lends this movie its dark humor. He moves from butcher's knife to gun (several) to ice pick and it's always somehow funny. He lights up the screen in this movie; it's an amazing performance.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is without question one of the finest gangster movies ever made, a benchmark even. It's that rare occasion for a genre film of this type where everything artistically comes together as one. Direction, script, editing, photography, driving soundtrack and crucially an ensemble cast firing on all cylinders. It's grade ""A"" film making that marked a return to form for Scorsese whilst simultaneously showing the director at the summit of his directing abilities.<br/><br/>The story itself, based on Nicholas Pileggi's non-fiction book Wiseguy, pulls absolutely no punches in its stark realisation of the Mafia lifestyle. It's often brutal, yet funny, unflinching yet stylish, but ultimately from first frame to last it holds the attention, toying with all the human emotions during the journey, tingling the senses of those who were by 1990 fed up of popcorn movie fodder.<br/><br/>It's not romanticism here, if anything it's a debunking of the Mafia myth, but even as the blood flows and the dialogue crackles with electricity, it always remains icy cool, brought to us by a man who had is eyes and ears open while growing up in Queens, New York in the 40s and 50s.

","This a brilliant and well casted film directed by Martin Scorsese. This is one of the films that for me are timeless especially because it's a true story. It is a classic Mob, gangster movie but portrayed in a different way. Every Mob movie was made the same after the God Father was made and this film stayed true to the plot and essence of the movie with new spin added to it. It has the violence, action and comedy. This is a film based on a true story focused around the main characters name Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta, James ""Jimmy"" Conway played by Robert De Niro and Tommy DeVito played by Joe Pesci. Henry and Tommy met as kids running numbers and a cigarette racket for the local Mob family and Jimmy. Henry and Jimmy could never fully be in the Mob as they we not full blooded Italians. So a lot of their security and opportunities came from Tommy who is full blooded Italian. As quickly as they rose to money and power it quickly went it way to do poor choices and loyalty.<br/><br/>This movie has your typical Mob style themes or plots. Henry is kid that comes from a good family and hardworking farther, but the street life of gangsters with nice clothes money and women is what attacked him and he felt like that was the life to live. Once he begins to affiliate himself with the family he enjoys the success of the money and respect and meets his future wife name Karen Hill played by Lorraine Bracco. She too quickly become comfortable and use to the life of the family. Getting thousands of dollars and not asking where it came from. Buying whatever she wanted with no question or worried about the prices, all the way down to the cops making regular visits to her house looking for anything criminal to build a case against Henry or any member of the family.<br/><br/>Jimmy is older than Henry and Tommy and has been in the life for a while. He is really the master mind of the crew. Nothing really gets down with his approval. He was like their mentor into the life crime and the life of the family. Every job they do is done his way and with no remorse. He has a simple method anyone that can get them caught or could stand in his way they ended up dead. <br/><br/>Tommy is the wild fire cracker of the group. He had a temper worse than Jimmy. You never can tell when Tommy is joking or serious. His temper is so bad that in parts of the movie you can see that Henry was scared of him even though they were child hood friends that grew up together. The best depiction of that is the scene when Tommy is telling a joking and Henry is laughing and Tommy ask what is so funny and Henry says the joke and Tommy with a serious tone ask what am I a funny guy do I amuse you and at the same time pulls a gun out. Henry gets scared and then Tommy starts laughing and says he is only joking. Tommy does what he wants because he wants to and doesn't think about consequence."

"dgold3111","8","0","0","20 October 2014"," Goodfellas: Good or Bad?
","*WARNING: SOME SPOILERS ARE CONTAINED IN THE REVIEW BELOW*<br/><br/>What's so great about being a gangster? What are the perks? Well, if you're a ""goodfella"" or one of the ""wise guys,"" you'll be able to let everyone know. Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990) is by far one of the greatest gangster movies made today. Scorsese is the director of other films such as Shutter Island, The Departed, and Wolf of Wall Street. Along with these great films, Goodfellas has received many awards, including an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Scorsese is able to bring the element of fear to the audience, but at the same time allows them to emphasize with a group of gangsters. <br/><br/>Watching this film, I realized that it doesn't have a structure. There is no concrete beginning, middle, or end, which is what keeps the audience tuned in throughout a long movie such as this one. The start of the film begins with a scene that likely (and as we find out later, does) come during the middle of the movie. We are started off with three of the main characters, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) driving in a car with what we discover is a dead body in the trunk, followed by the voice of a young Henry Hill saying, ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."" This background narration of his voice foreshadows that he is going to take us back to square one, to the days that he knew he wanted to be one of them; part of the mafia.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the film is what creates the elements and moods that the audience feels while watching the film There are many scenes in the film that are long shots; which are shots taken without any editing. Watching a film, that foremost, is considered to be more of a story than have a plot line, is much more interesting to watch through long shots. These shots are able to make an audience feel more connected to the characters in the film. The audience is able to follow different characters in the film and see exactly what they are doing, where they are going, and who they are dealing with, all in one shot. <br/><br/>What really kept me interested in Goodfellas is how hard it is to determine who are the protagonists and who are the antagonists. I enjoy a challenge and I enjoy watching a movie that makes me think. Since the film is so long, and there are only so many main characters, it takes a longer time to unravel their secrets, personalities, and lifestyles. After watching the entire film, I left still not knowing for sure if I would consider any of the characters to be protagonists. Throughout the film, we see nearly each character either; steal, murder, do drugs and/or make all sorts of illegal deals. Then again, this is what kept me on my toes. This is why this movie is different from all of the others. There doesn't have to be a specific hero or villain. It's truly depicted on how the audience interprets the movie. You are never completely positive which person was doing the right thing in any situation. <br/><br/>Another thing this film does wonderfully is provide a great social commentary about the mafia versus the government. Considering that this movie is based off a true story and book; Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family; it is considered to be a semi documentary. Containing some truth and factual details to the events in the film; it is able to shed light on the inner networks of the mafia. We, as an audience, are able to see inside a group that most people would fear, but as we watch we consider emphasizing with them instead. We see how the mafia is intertwined with small businesses, big businesses and especially the government. It was complete corruption. During the final trial scene with Henry Hill testifying against his longtime friend, Jimmy Conway, Hill makes a comment where he admits that they paid off policemen, lawyers, and judges. They got away with everything because they were feared by everyone around them. The entire movie revolves around the commentary that all outsiders feared them, but once you were in, you loved them, and they were family. <br/><br/>By the end, I left the film not sure whether or not I should feel bad for the gangsters who were murdered, sent to jail, or sent to the witness protection program; or whether I should have been happy justice was served. That feeling that I had was exactly why I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to think critically; to anyone who appreciates a challenge with their inner-self while watching a film. If you appreciate action, violence, loyalty and betrayal, love and unfaithfulness; this movie is calling your name."

","The greatest Gangster film that I have seen, it does something that even The Godfather, did not do.<br/><br/>Here is a film on organized crime that is having a voice over of it's protagonist for good amount of time and it makes the film all the more interesting. I love many shots in the film, like the conversation shots between Paulie and Henry, or the way jokes of Joe Pesci are captured or even the murders. Damn, this is all very realistic and it's admirable to have achieved it this way. Indeed at times it plays like a documentary unlike a fiction film. Also, the film is told in first person not only by Henry but also by his wife Karen. Damn, it makes the film reliable and real.<br/><br/>The performances are superb, each detail, each nuance is done well, nothing seems out of place, a jaw dropping murder of rib tickling joke, all seem so natural in emotions here. Joe Pesci gets out some wonderful lines. Robert DeNiro is extremely cold blooded as Jimmy. Paul Sorvino as Paulie is authoritative. Loranne Bracco as Karen is loving. Ray Liotta as Henry is infectious and fragile. There is a host of other characters that are wonderful too. <br/><br/>We must understand that these characters actually existed in reality and from their interviews was the book, Wise Gy written by Nicolas Pilleggi. GoodFellas was based on this book only. Scorsese is indeed the most interesting director of our times, who takes varied themes and puts it all in the pan and cooks it so well that the dish surely tastes delicious.<br/><br/>To showcase power, he takes an interesting point where Henry takes his Karen into a restaurant by surpassing the crowd, going through the back door and a table is literally lifted and placed for them. To showcase guilt, Scorsese uses conversation between Jimmy and Henry. To showcase crime, he shows us just a few gunshots and how emotionless the killer is. Damn, all this makes it such interesting and a fun film. The camera movement is adept and so is the cinematographer. But to dive the camera and the cameraman, the director is needed. Scorsese precisely is such director. <br/><br/>This is not actually a Gangster film, I will rather call it as a film that is made on Organised Crime in a throughly interesting way and with eccentric and interesting characters. Of course, the cast does get all the chords right and takes the characters into a new level.<br/><br/>It is indeed long with a length of 140 minutes, but it's an easy film for a movie buff. But for the non-aficionados the characters names and the length may take a toll. But I will say, most film-goers have considered this a good film as per ratings all over, thus even the claim that it is lengthy can be cut off. <br/><br/>I am giving 5/5 for this wonderful film, that is self indulgent at times, but the best part is that it indulges you as viewer. Kudos to the master Scorsese for this."
"GeorgeRoots","9","0","0","6 September 2014"," Go Liotta!
","Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and an outstanding job from Ray Liotta. ""Goodfellas"" has everything that says priceless, as well as adding some new values to the lifestyle. Dare I say it modernises both the look and era of the genre, to which many still consider it the best gangster flick to come out since ""The Godfather"" (1972). It's a bold statement, and I just don't think it's that same level of good. Still pretty fantastic regardless.<br/><br/>As story goes it's pretty strong. Based on the real events of gangster-turned informative Henry Hill (Played by Liotta), it tells his story of growing up in organised crime and his somewhat ""initiation"", that ultimately leads to him meeting Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway (Robert De Niro), and loose cannon Tommy DeVito (An Oscar winning performance by Joe Pesci). From then on we as an audience grow up with Henry Hill and his ageing, his addiction to drugs, his time in prison and the meeting of his future wife. All of it portrayed as a ""glamorous"" lifestyle, or as a stick of dynamite with the fuse nearly out. During the 1970's, the gang commits the infamous Lufthansa Heist, and starts killing off other members from rival gangs to assure dominance. Bizarrely, they start offing their own as well to assert their power, will Henry survive?<br/><br/>Well again, tops to Martin Scorsese. Truly the best man you could want behind the camera for this kind of genre. Every detail in the background is crisp, and the shadows in the corners of the frame have never looked so menacing and unsafe. Broad, dark and flashy, ""Goodfellas"" is a great film. Luckily for us Scorsese would revisit this kind of lifestyle a few years later in ""Casino"" (1995), but since then nothing has felt quite like this and I can't think of a 1990's gangster film that compliments the old tropes of the genre. As piles and piles of new-age British gangster movies appear, they all deal with nothing but sex, drugs, football and money. There are no values in these movies that come off legitimate anymore.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: A landmark film to kick off the 1990's, ""Goodfellas"" is the kind of movie that just gets better with age. 9/10."

","(Spolier) Martin Scorsese's film ""Goodfellas,"" is an adaption of the book Wiseguy, written by Nicholas Pileggi. It may be one of the best gangster movies ever made. It is raw and gritty, unlike movies of the same genre like, ""The Untouchables"" or ""The Godfather"". Scorsese stayed true to the nature of what life is really like when you are a part of the mob.<br/><br/>Throughout the film you see the inside dealings of the mob. These men hold nothing back. They will tell you how it is, and will whack anyone who is out of line and disrespectful. The life of the mob is about loyalty, respect, and proving you are worthy of this family. There are certain rules you have to abide by in order to work your way up and be ""made."" Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) represents this perfectly. He is quick to start a fight, or draw his gun if he feels that he is being disrespected. Later on in the film, his fate is realized when revenge is taken out on him. This movie is based on the actual events of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). In the first half of the movie, you are introduced to Henry, and how he became entangled with the mob. He always knew he was meant to be a part of this life. Being a gangster meant that you were a part of a family, and belonged to this elite group that would forever look out for you, as long as you remained true to them. A gangster is the embodiment of masculinity. You have money and women at your disposal and no one would ever mess with you, because you are a ""tough guy"". Who wouldn't want that?<br/><br/>It's been said that too much of something can become problematic. The second half of the film you witness Henry's downfall. He leads a double life. He has a wife, Karen (Lorraine Bracco) and children at home, and girlfriends on the side. One girlfriend in particular, Sandy (Debi Mazar) helps him with his new business of dealing and selling cocaine. He was never satisfied. He knew that his involvement could compromise his relationships with Karen and with the mob, especially his boss Pauly Cicero (Paul Sorvino). This didn't stop him, he thought he could handle it. He was organized, after all that is what the mob is all about, organized crime. <br/><br/>The music and the dialogue that was chosen, added authenticity to the film. The music was chosen based on the time period the scenes were set in. In Henry's earlier life you heard songs by Tony Bennet, and The Cleftones. In his later life you heard songs by The Rolling Stones and The Who. Music provided transitions between certain scenes, specifically, when Henry was a teenager and he walked out of the court room. He was met by all of the members of the mob cheering for him. He had learned a valuable lesson, you don't ever snitch and you keep your mouth shut. The frame freezes, music begins to play, and you have now jumped several years into 1963.<br/><br/>The dialogue was what you would expect to hear from a mobster. Much of the great dialogue was discovered through rehearsals, where Scorsese let his actors roam free, then wrote into the script many of the lines they came up with (admin, 2013). The use of voice over narration was crucial to the tone of the film. Without it, the movie would not be what it is. It was essential for Henry to fill in the background information needed in order to understand what was happening in the story. <br/><br/>If you want to get the best idea of what life is like as gangster in the mob, this the movie to watch. <br/><br/>References admin.

"jcbutthead86","10","0","0","20 April 2013"," An Excellent,Flawless Masterpiece And Classic From Martin Scorsese And One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made.
","Goodfellas is an excellent,flawless Masterpiece and a Classic and it's not only one of the greatest Gangster Films ever made and one of the greatest films of the 90's but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with masterful direction,excellent performances and a great soundtrack,Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite films and is Martin Scorsese and cinema at it's best.<br/><br/>Set in New York,based on the true life book Wiseguy by Nicolas Pileggi and based on a true story,Goodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill(Ray Liotta)an Irish-Italian man who has had a love for Gangsters and gangster life since he was a teenager in his local neighborhood. As a youngster Henry starts working for the Mob and as a he gets older Henry becomes apart of the Mob and living the lifestyle of a gangster. Over the course of three decades Henry Hill along with his friends Jimmy The Gent Conway(Robert De Niro)and Tommy DeVito(Joe Pesci)depicts Henry's easy rise in the Mob and his hard and dangerous downfall.<br/><br/>Right from the opening credits and all the way to the very end Goodfellas is a flawless masterwork of a film that pulls you end and does not let go until the final frame. Martin Scorsese has created a film that right next to Francis Coppola's The Godfather as the definitive Gangster film. But where as The Godfather was an epic and somewhat romantic view of gangster like and a Mob family,Goodfellas took a much different direction and gives viewers a darker,less romantic view of Mob showing viewers a world of how a Mobster lives his life as a gangster. What is different about Goodfellas is that the story tells the story from the point of view of the gangsters who works is not a Mob Boss or someone who runs a crime family but someone who works under the Mob bosses. One of the things I love about the film Goodfellas is the way Scorsese plays with the audience showing things from Henry Hill's point of view where from Hill's point of view the Mob is a great way of living and a easy way to make money and live the good life showing the glamour,suits and cars making audiences love the lifestyle. But Scorsese tricks audiences and shows us that Gangster and Mob life can be a dangerous and violent way of living where you can either be killed or sent to prison. Scorsese gives the film a since of dread where there is violence in the air and that being in the Mob is not all it's cracked up to be. Some Films based on true stories while good are most of the time told in a straight forward fashion and if Goodfellas had been in the hands of another filmmaker it would have been more of a straight forward true story but Scorsese being the master filmmaker that he is fills the film with great scenes and moments that are iconic and memorable and Scorsese keeps you glued to the screen engrossed by the film and making you want more making Goodfellas one of the greatest true stories on film. The screenplay by Scorsese and Pileggi is impressive giving the film excellent dialog and scenes with great realism and edge making you as the viewer feel like you are in the scenes with the characters. Goodfellas is one of the fastest 2 and a half hours you will ever go through because when the film starts it never slows down and let's you breath a sigh of relief. The pace is so rapid and quick you will feel like you are watching a 90 minute film rather than a two and a half hour one. I think it's because of the documentary and raw feel of the film and how we as the viewer are in the movie. Goodfellas is like a Rock N'Roll record put on film where you are looking and listening. The main characters in the film are not what you would call likable,but are well-developed and there is times when you can relate to them and you see things from their point of view and you get pulled into their state of minds. The ending and final 20-30 minutes is a classic ending filled with suspense and paranoia that is pushed to the max. It's an ending you will not forget.<br/><br/>The cast does excellent jobs in their roles. Ray Liotta is amazing in his career defining role as Henry Hill,with Liotta bringing intensity and wild energy to the role. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Jimmy Conway,with De Niro being menacing and unforgettable. Joe Pesci is brilliant in his Oscar winning role as the volatile Tommy DeVito,with Pesci being scary,intense and funny at the same time. Lorraine Bracco is riveting as Karen Hill,Henry's wife. Bracco has great chemistry with Liotta. Paul Sorvino is captivating and suave as Paulie,the boss over everybody. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Billy Batts,a made guy from Tommy's past. Frank Sivero(Frankie Carbone),Chuck Low(Morris),Michael Imperioli(Spider),Debi Mazer(Sandy),Gina Mastrogiacomo(Janice)and Catherine Scorsese(Tommy's Mother)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an early role by Samuel L. Jackson in the role of Stacks.<br/><br/>The direction by Martin Scorsese is masterful and brilliant,with Scorsese always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and visual style. Great direction by Scorsese.<br/><br/>The soundtrack in the film is one of best soundtracks in movie history with classics by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Monkey Man),Donovan(Atlantis),The Crystels(Then He Kissed Me),Cream(Sunshine Of Your Love),The Who(Magic Bus),Harry Nilsson(Jump Into The Fire),Sid Vicious(My Way),Bobby Darin(Beyond The Sea),Aretha Franklin(Baby I Love you),Eric Clapton,Derek and The Dominoes(Layla,Piano Exit),George Harrison(What Is Life)and more. Excellent soundtrack.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Gangster films,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Goodfellas,a timeless Masterpiece and Classic that you can watch again and again and should be in every film lover's collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","""GoodFellas"" is simply (after ""The GodFather"") the best-mafia gangster film ever made, and this is very clear in this movie.<br/><br/>The story begins with Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a young Irish living in the suburbs of New York with his family, and suddenly finds himself involved with the Italian Mafia, and after some work and be arrested for the first time, he is finally integrated into the mob-family. Years pass and the life of Henry is now on the mob-business, a little work there, a robbery there, always with their best friends and partners James (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci).<br/><br/>As the story progresses, Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi (screenplay) explore the world mobster in an impressive way. It's almost watching a lesson in how to be a professional criminal. Always keeping a realistic pace, and that little black humor that always Scorsese uses in his films, achieving the film both interesting and pure entertainment.<br/><br/>The entire cast does an excellent job, Robert De Niro despite not appear much, manages to be great; Ray Liotta is also excellent, but who gives a fantastic performance throughout the film is undoubtedly Joe Pesci.<br/><br/>From beginning to end we see the Mafia as never before, while maintaining an impressive pace of entertainment, very well written and directed, ""GoodFellas"" is surely one of the best works of Scorsese to be remembered."

","Goodfellas is a fantastic movie with a great story line and a truly inspired cast,Joe Pesci performance is fantastic and he completely deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.There was really only two problems I had with the movie,I didn't like how they put Robert De Niro's name before Ray Liotta's in the credits and even on the posters he is in front,this is making you think that James Conway is the main character,but thats not true,Henry Hill is,and although I obviously prefer Robert De Niro to Ray Liotta,he is the main character,and no one will know that going into the movie.I also don't like how they changed the narration to Lorraine Bracco's character,because Henry Hill is narrating,and it doesn't make any sense to change to another character,Forrest Gump doesn't go from Tom Hanks narrating,and suddenly jump to Robin Wright.<br/><br/>Going through the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who narrates his life,starting as a young man wanting to be part of the mafia,to being part of it and quickly regretting it."

","This is by far, the best movie I have ever seen! Every single bit of the movie was just outstanding! Joe Pesci won his Oscar for it most certainly defiantly deserved it! In fact all the main characters in the film should've at least been nominated for an Oscar, everyone was brilliant. But Martin Scorsese should've won the Oscar for best director, he did an amazing job! The screenplay was just right! Yes, I know it's very brutal and full of swear words, but that was how gangster life was like. Plus it had adult humor in which worked brilliantly! *SPOILER!* For example when Joe Pesci's character shoots a boy, everyone gets all cross with him and annoyed, and he said 'well it was a good shot'! That sort of dark humor just puts the cherry on the cake!"

","Both watched the film and read the book and both are amazing. In terms of accuracy they're pretty terrific, there are a few differences but they're not significant. In real life Tommy was a huge, powerful man whilst Pesci in the film is diminutive but no less terrifying. Tommy wasn't shot in the face so his family couldn't have an open coffin as featured in the film, he just disappeared and was never seen again (which is exactly what happened to his girlfriend a short time later). The famous 'funny how?' story was not actually something which happened to Henry Hill but was something which really did happen to Joe Pesci whilst he was working as a waiter for some genuine Mafioso. <br/><br/>Tremendous performances all around, De Niro his customary excellent, a career making turn from both Ray Liotta and Loraine Brocco and did you spot a then unknown Samuel L Jackson as Stacks? In many ways though it's Pesci who dominates, prior to this he was largely known as a comic actor with Home Alone and Lethal Weapon 2, such a small guy but just full of unbelievable aggressiveness, he makes you shudder. <br/><br/>What I really like about it is that it shows you both the good side and the bad side of being a gangster. On the good side you are the 'movie-star with muscle' everything just falls into your lap and you live the life of Reilly, even when you go to prison you're treated special. On the bad side you have to do things like dig up the rotting corpses of other gangsters you've murdered and rebury them. Keep looking over your shoulder for the police and FBI all the time. And that your friends aren't really your friends, they'll happily rat you out if they think it'll save them or slit your throat if they think there's 5 bucks in it for them (""F*ck you, pay me!"") <br/><br/>One thing I would suggest is that if you enjoyed this you should check out 'The Big Heist' with Donald Sutherland, a TV movie starring Donald Sutherland which concentrates on Jimmy Burke."

","One of the finest films in history, Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is a true phenomenon and stands out as the leading film in the gangster movie genre.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of the life of mobster, Henry Hill, portrayed by Ray Liotta, and his and his fellow ""wiseguys"" Jimmy(Robert De Niro), Tommy(Joe Pesci) and boss Paulie(Paul Sorvino). The casting for the film is absolutely spot on,as every character is played with complete conviction and credibility. Everyone in the film has insecurities and conflicting emotions shown throughout, and whats amazing about these characters is how their personalities lead them into dissolution. <br/><br/>Despite how disturbing these mobsters are, the maniacal and unpredictable Joe Pesci especially, there is something likable about them, and even as Liotta's character slowly goes from rise to fall into a life of excessive drug abuse, it still feels as if he is the protagonist in the film.<br/><br/>Another actor deserving a mention for a brilliant performance in the film is Lorraine Bracco, who plays Karen, Henry's first wife, from first meeting her character when she goes out with a reluctant Henry, you wouldn't believe throughout all the troubles she sticks by Henry and eventually succumbs to his lifestyle, as quoted ""it turns her on"".<br/><br/>The sense of family in the mob is ever present in the film, with Paulie acting as a father figure for Henry, who is inspired by Jimmy and Tommy, and the three embark down a violent road of crime, from robberies to murder, meanwhile getting married and having children.<br/><br/>Another brilliant feature of the film is the soundtrack, a brilliant selection of songs spanning over twenty years that set the scenes. From Tony Bennett's ""Rags To Riches"" to Derek and The Dominoes' ""Layla"", each song is combined perfectly to comment on the actions in the film.<br/><br/>The screenplay for the movie, based on Nicolas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"" is completely flawless, gripping and intense throughout, keeping the audience fixated on how the characters are going to respond or take action next.<br/><br/>Personally, for me this is Martin Scorsese's best film and one of my favourite films, it captures the life of this young boy turned gangster perfectly with iconic scenes again and again, making it a memorable spectacle to watch."

","Goodfellas is one of the best mafia films you'll ever been blessed to see in your lifetime, right down to the letter in terms of acting, directing, but especially scripting. I have this fantastic script in book form, where the film honors the script one hundred percent. Goodfellas is quite a scary movie in terms of it's character's attributes, the main one being Pesci's, his Tommy, played with such a haunting ferocity. This is the most scary performance I've seen in a mafia film. He makes the character he played in Casino, Nicky Santori, look tame, although the the two bare some resemblances, especially in the violence and recklessness department. The story is told through the eyes of mafia figure, Henry Hill, played superbly by Ray Liotta, his most notable performance, when the mentioning of this actor's name comes up. Hill who died a while back, had described the mafia as a dark and terrifying world as seen through this brilliant film. It's through his eyes we meet these characters, like Jimmy the Gent, Conway, De Niro excelling himself again, and also Paul Sorvino as Paulie Cicero, a Sicilian godfather less threatening cause of his laid back manner, but looks can be deceiving. We move through Henry's wannabe mafia type, from childhood, that had him skipping school, subjecting him to a whacking from his father here and there, right through to his two incarcerations, where after getting out of the second one, thanks to his mother in law who puts up bail, he is soon making a deal of immunity. Reasons. One, his wife (Bracco) who goes to see Deniro is pointed towards this alley where all these coats are hanging. Should she go in there? No, why? Cause she'll probably get whacked. She options to quickly take off instead. To me, this was the most terrifying moment in this near two and a half hour film. Two, the other reason, Deniro asks Liotta to whack a guy down in Miami, and knows that if he accepts this, he won't came back alive. Death is shown so cheaply here, where if you don't do the right thing, the probability of living is null. One of the hoods, Stax, played by Samuel L Jackson in one of it's memorable bloody scenes, is one such an example, where a montage of other victims follow. Goodfellas has some real bloody moments, one involving a connected guy who's celebrating, getting out, on Henry's Hill's actual birthday, where his mouth earns him a helluva of a bashing, followed by a freshly dug grave. When it comes to violence, this movie is uncompromising, but these thugs existed. Again at Goodfellas's end, as to Hill's living arrangements, once more we see that crime just doesn't pay, but it pays bloody well to seen this 1990 classic."
"LeonLouisRicci","10","0","0","5 January 2013"," Masterful Manipulation
","It is a great Movie that can have you believing what you saw was not what you saw. It is the genius of Advertising and The Con. Contrary to popular belief this is not a glamorization of The Mob or their lifestyle, in fact, it is just the opposite. No matter how much the narrator/main Character tells us how attractive it is and how desirable it is to be a Wiseguy, the Film denies this in almost every scene.<br/><br/>It is the rhythm, the staccato of it all that hypnotizes us into believing what he is saying, but not what is actually occurring. The pulsating Music Soundtrack and the uncanny mesmerizing voice over lulls the Audience into a false sense of a wanting place. It is the work of the Devil. Or at least a devilishly good Film-Maker. <br/><br/>There is nothing attractive here. The People are ugly and unpleasant and constantly do ugly and unpleasant things. The Sets are mundane, gaudy and unattractive, as are the clothes. There is not one appealing aspect to any of this Photo-Play. Yet, Audiences are led by this pied piper Scorsese into the rat-a-tat-tat ruminations of a heel and a turncoat and they actually care about this crumb.<br/><br/>Such is the magical work of a Movie Maker obsessed with style that cannot be denied His Craft. This is a fugazi. A manipulative Movie. A sinful master work that is a temptation worthy of a great deceiver."

","There are many films that I would highly rate when it comes to crime films. Pulp Fiction, Dark Knight, The Godfather and the Shawshank Redemption but in this list will always come Goodfellas. <br/><br/>Goodfellas is not just a movie about gangsters. Its a movie that has heart and emotion as well as comedy, violence and pretty much everything else. Much of the film focuses on the inner self of our three main mobsters: Henry, Jimmy and Tommie. The film deeply explores the personalities of each character and shows us the friendship between these three criminals. This film does something ""Quentin Tarantino"" ish and that is something I found interesting for a Martin Scorsosse film and that is the link between the opening scene and a scene approximately half way during the movie. The film mainly focuses on Henry, our main character, as a boy at a young age who had admired and wanted to be a gangster like the family he idolised, the Luchhes'. <br/><br/>I found each of the main characters fascinating, and as much as I liked the character story for Henry, I mainly enjoyed Joe Pesci's Oscar winning performance as Tommie. I often found myself laughing at Tommie. <br/><br/>The casting for this film could not have been any better. Robert de Niro as Jimmy was brilliant, Ray Liatto as Henry was great and most of all Joe Pesci as Tommie was the best of the three.<br/><br/>I liked the story very much which focuses on Henry as he mainly tries to become a gangster in order to also help out his family. I found the ending emotional and brilliantly done.<br/><br/>Overall, fans of crime movies must check out Goodfellas. It'll hardly disappoint!"

","The film is based on Wiseguys, the true story of Henry Hill's rise & fall in the Luchesse crime family during 1955-80.<br/><br/>In 1950s Bronx, young Henry Hill admires gangsters who according to him live an ideal life.He quits school and joins the gang under Paulie (Paul Sorvino) , doing jobs like paying off people & collecting protection money. He meets Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) whose main work is hijacking cargo trucks. He learns the biggest rule of crime life from him - Never rat on your friends & always keep your mouth shut.<br/><br/>In the 60s, the adult Henry(Ray Liotta) with Tommy Vito (Joe Pesci),a psychopathic gangster & Jimmy work to spread the gang's influence. Henry & the others hang around with numerous women in nightclubs in an intimidating manner .In 1967, Henry carries out the Air France robbery thereby making his entry into bigtime crime. He marries a Jewish girl Karen (Lorraine Bracco) who is seduced by his glamorous lifestyle. She accepts his crime life, mostly because it gives her an opulent living. <br/><br/>In 1970 Tommy brutally beats Billy Batts (Frank Vincent) for insulting his poor origins, Jimmy too joining in. They are in trouble as Batts is a made man with the Gambinos. They bury him in the outskirts of the city, stopping midway to finish off the half alive Batts. Later they are forced to exhume and rebury the corpse elsewhere when they find out that the land due to a new construction project.<br/><br/>Henry soon takes a mistress. Karen pulls a gun on him, he overpowers her and tells her that he has bigger worries than her, like getting killed on the street. Paulie meets him and orders him to return to her, and sends him with Jimmy to recover money from a defaulter. But the target's sister is a typist with FBI, she turns over the entire gang (her brother included) to the police. In order to make his ends meet, Henry resorts to drug running from jail.<br/><br/>Upon release from prison in 1978,he continues his cocaine trading which he had started in jail, much to the disapproval of Paulie who sternly warns him to stop it immediately. He not only ignores this warning, but ropes in Jimmy and Tommy and various other people, including Karen, his daughters babysitter and a new drug addict girlfriend. <br/><br/>The same year, Henry along with the crew, carries out the Lufthansa heist in JFK airport , which is the biggest hijacking of goods in US history.Some gang members start spending the proceeds from the heist immediately, buying expensive things that put them in the spotlight. Jimmy promptly has them murdered and later on,also has one by one all the other participants of the heist murdered, their corpses turning up in different parts of the city for months. Henry knows that Jimmy has all the cash from the heist, and he is merely eliminating the partners to have it all to himself, but cant do anything. One day, Tommy is lured by promises to make him a made man and killed, by his own gang members as a revenge for the murder of Billy Batts in order to make peace with the Gambinos.<br/><br/>By 1980, Henry is a cocaine addicted wreck, sustaining himself solely by drug running, due to which he has alienated Paulie and the others. He is on the constant surveillance of the FBI , who finally tail him an entire and arrest him. During his absence, his house is also raided, and Karen in order to evade arrest and conviction flushes down the entire cocaine stash, thereby rendering themselves virtually penniless.<br/><br/>Jimmy goes to Paulie for help, who being angry with him due to his drug operations, pays him $3200 and ends all association with him.He gets a final shock when he realizes that Jimmy intends to have him killed, by setting him up in a hit, in order to erase the last link between him and the Lufthansa heist.<br/><br/>With no other way to save himself and his family, Henry agrees to become an FBI informant under the witness protection plan. As a result of his collaboration and his testimony, Paulie, Jimmy and all the major members of the gang are arrested and sentenced to long terms in prison without parole. Henry himself gets a sentence which is further reduced due to his collaboration.<br/><br/>The last shot of the film shows a very vulnerable looking Henry Hill ,now divorced, who in a final voice over says that the good times are over and that he is penniless just like the average working people that he used to ridicule .The closing credits show his fate and that of all the others in the gang, being put away for life.<br/><br/>Scorsese maintains a good pace, with a crisp background narration. Gangsters are shown as what they are, vermin beneath the shining suits . It perfectly shows that crime never pays giving the message subtly, sans preaching or moral dialogues, instead leaving the viewer to figure it out as the film goes along.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta plays Henry efficiently, right from the background narration to his transition from a brash gangster to a sorry shadow of his former self. Lorraine Bracco is fine as Karen. Robert DeNiro very beautifully portrays the cunning & vicious Jimmy Conway ,a friend one instant and a killer the next, his screen time is shorter than usual but just as effective. But the show stealer is Joe Pesci as the psychopathic Tommy Vito who is crazy & vicious at the same time, as the one who intimidates Henry or the one who calmly shoots a waiter for being late in serving him.<br/><br/>Oscars snubbed this great work and only Joe Pesci got his due. But it rightly was a commercial & critical success and will always remain a favourite for any avid film viewer."

A made man means you could not be touched unless it was a ""just cause."" But still Hill manages to be lured by the glamorous lifestyle of mob life.<br/><br/>Due to mob leader Paulie Cierco(Paul Sorvino) a leader of a few words but a dangerous one and Jimmy ""the Gent"" Conway, his mentor whom you should not get on his bad side(Robert De Niro). Both lead and guide Henry while the young man encounters both glamor and danger at the same time.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Tommy Devito(Oscar-winner Joe Pesci), as he is really trigger happy and has a awful temper and says lots of foul language. But only time you will see him nice is with his mom(played by the director's late mom, Catherine.<br/><br/>Hill also is something of a womanizer before and during his marriage to Karen, a Jewish woman(played by the ""Sopranos"" Lorraine Bracco).

While trying to avoid the FBI and doing so much. In his drug dealing ways catch up to him. Will the mob make him pay? Great script and really a great acting. And directing as it is a Scorsese classic. Liotta should had been a household name but bad picks caused him to not let him do that. Still he is great as Hill.<br/><br/>Same with Bracco as she revived her career with ""The Sopranos."" Joe Pesci is really the scene stealing. You love to hate him but still, no wonder he walked away with the award, De Niro is great. He gives way to Liotta.

","These are among the first words spoken by Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) in Martin Scorsese's modern classic ""GoodFellas"". The film chronicles Hill's career in the mob through 25 turbulent years that see him living the high life for a while until the occupational hazards of a life of crime start to catch up with him.<br/><br/>The story is based on the book ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi, who also wrote the book upon which ""Casino"" was based. We're invited into the underworld of crime by a narrator who invests the story with credibility. Although glamorous at times, the movie pulls no punches when it comes to violence. Such is as it should be, in the interests of authenticity.<br/><br/>The cast leaves little to be desired. Ray Liotta was a relative newcomer at the time but his portrayal of Henry Hill is so engaging that it makes it easy to root for the bad guys. Robert De Niro & Joe Pesci, who previously teamed up to great effect in Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"", shared the screen again here. Pesci of course went on to win the Oscar for his downright frightening portrayal of volatile gangster Tommy DeVito, while De Niro's performance was more understated but no less impressive. Lorraine Bracco was a bit of a weak link in my opinion but she did garner some attention for her performance at the time. Beyond the stars, Frank Vincent & Paul Sorvino are especially memorable while a handful of others also make an impression with the limited amount of screen time they have to work with.<br/><br/>In technical terms, ""GoodFellas"" is practically flawless. Scorsese's direction is impeccable and his employment of popular music shows great taste and ingenuity. The cinematography of Michael Ballhaus is always attractive and the film was expertly assembled by Scorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker. The sets and costume design also deserve high praise for authenticity.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""GoodFellas"" certainly must rank as one of the greatest gangster movies of all time. There are countless memorable sights and sounds contained within the film's 146 minutes. That being said, I don't think it's quite as good as ""The Godfather"" due to some minor imperfections. Still, it's a must for any discerning movie fan."

Even as you watch these people do horrible things and pay dearly in the end for their actions, you still kind of leave thinking ""Being a gangster seems pretty sweet."" One of the ways the film tricks you is by making these characters likable. Henry is charming, Tommy is funny (although don't call him that!), Jimmy is everyone's big brother.

But it's Joe Pesci's Oscar-winning performance that makes the movie, stealing almost every scene he's in. Director Martin Scorsese has totally knocked the ball out of the park with this movie. ""Goodfellas"" is the movie that precisely shows how extraordinary a director that Scorsese is. He perfectly captures the true gangster life, and tells the story in such a brilliant profession. Everything about this movie is filmmaking at it's finest. From the incredible performances by the ensemble cast, the brilliant well-written dialouge, directing, editing, cinematography, and music. By the way, this movie has some of the best writing ever put to film. The dialouge feels authentic and realistic, and it reveals the realism of it all. The violence is brutal and bloody, and some moments will leave you speechless. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of gangster films, or film in general, everybody will find something to love in ""Goodfellas"". Although this movie lost the Best Picture Oscar to ""Dances with Wolves"" in 1990, ""Goodfellas"" was a more better choice. This is an authentic, powerful, and excellent piece of work from the great Martin Scorsese. This is also one of my favorite movies of all time. ""Goodfellas"", in my review, ""original and authentic, an excellent masterpiece""."

","Goodfellas follows the exploits of Henry Hill and his friends as they strive to gain power in the mob in the middle of the 20th century. Hill gets involved in arson, robbery, hijacking and even murder with his pals Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVito. Ambition and power comes a great cost to Hill and his family however, as he descends into world of addiction, paranoia and in the end, he betrays the two rules he was taught years previously, never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut...<br/><br/>Since its release in 1990, Goodfellas has become a landmark in the crime genre and a significant picture in the recent history of cinema, and rightly so. Few crimes, like The Godfather, effectively convey the importance of family like Goodfellas does. The film features sterling performances from Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro as always. <br/><br/>Scorsese is known for his effective use of score and it is perhaps at its peak here. Songs from The Rolling Stones, Derek and the Dominoes and George Harrison bring the period to life and set the tone for the film perfectly. Scorsese's direction must also be praised, a trademark in the long tracking shot resurfaces in a scene which follows Henry and Karen into a restaurant, through the corridors, through the kitchen and to their seat in a shot that lasts a good minute and a half at least.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is one of those movies that towers above modern cinema with its realistic and brutal view of life in the mob, its sympathetic characters and it stands as one of the finest reasons for why Martin Scorsese may be the greatest and most influential director alive, if not in the whole of cinema history."

","20 Years after Joe Pesci asked, ""Do I amuse you?"" it's still hard not to be terrified by the selfish cruelty. The true story of mob rat Henry Hill seduces us with raw honesty and a charming ""matter of fact monologue"" by Ray Liotta. Is lying to yourself a white lie when it keeps you focused on the crime at hand? When Lorraine Bracco joins in and mirrors the storytelling monologue from the viewpoint of an outsider being charmed into the family, and suddenly the gangster genre is taken to new levels. Robert De Niro is masterful as Jimmy Conway spiraling out of control. Martin Scorcese's vision comes across through the inner workings of the Copacana to using the beautiful finality of the coda of ""Layla"", as the Lufthansa heist crew are innocently discovered all over the place. And these guys are Goodfellas? That's the hypocrisy played out."

","I think that this movie shows a great combination of the rise and fall of the American mafia and how drugs played a huge part in bringing it down. The movie seems to cover all aspects of being a made member in the mafia and the problems that arise between money and greed. It shows how most of these men are complete sociopaths and have no regard for human life. A lot of mob movies show the glamorous side of being a mobster, but Goodfellas also shows the darker sides of these men and their activities. The actors portrayed what a made man was like back in the 1950's perfect. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys Italian-American mob related history."

","When I first heard of Goodfellas, I was intrigued. It wasn't about a a single part of a gangster's life, it wasn't about the one part where the gangster decided to move along, it wasn't all that sappy, stupid stuff. It was about the LIFE of a gangster, and that meant realism..<br/><br/>Realism is a change sometimes, because it's either overused or underused. People make it so hyper-realistic, it may be a bit boring. On the latter, they use so many things to make it unrealistic that it doesn't even make sense to watch it. But realism works as a counterpart, and it was a film by Martin Scorsese. Who could go wrong with that?<br/><br/>I turned it on, watched it, and enjoyed it. It worked as a gangster movie, but anything outside of that? I had some mixed feelings...<br/><br/>The acting was brilliant. Everything did such an amazing job, I was surprised at how good it was. Especially how I've heard some scenes were acted how by REAL gangsters. And some scenes weren't told to the background actors, so their reactions were real and surprised.. The screenplay was really well-done. The jokes weren't supposed to be laugh- out-loud funny, but the actors played their parts and perfected them. Their sarcastic behavior made it THIS much more enjoyable and I had a grin upon my face the entire time.. The thing that made this the best was how the whole film reflected of the entire life of a gangster, and how things go in between. Instead of believing I was just watching a movie, I believed I was watching the unfolding of a gangster's life. We have the start, the life of them, the ups and downs, and how everything just goes downhill. We go on an array of emotions and much more. Classic.. But there seemed to be a problem with all of this. Although the movie broke-ground for future movies, there seemed to be this blandness to it. I don't know what it was. I loved the movie as a whole, but looking as I hadn't seen it when it became a classic, it seemed a bit contrived maybe? It seems sad to say that because I wanted to like it more than I had. But something seemed wrong. Something seemed not Scorsese about it... <br/><br/>Bad things stop there. The movie really was great, and I really do recommend watching it. But as it receives such high praise, maybe I had too much expectation(s) to surpass the un-originality the film gave to me. But the film was good, no doubt about it.<br/><br/>7/10."

","If I can pick out a flaw in this film it would be that it's unbelievably addictive. I remember there was a day I watched it twice back to back after watching it the day before and a couple of times the week before. Even though I knew what will happen each second and know every single dialogue I'm still so fascinated by the film, I'm so fascinated that I even purchased the book. Most people say books are better than films which I agree however Goodfellas surpassed the book! All credit goes to Martin Scorcese, the cast, the acting and the amazing music. <br/><br/>From the minute Goodfellas start you just don't want the film to end you get so caught up in lives of 'Henry Hill', 'Jimmy Conway' and 'Tommy deSimone' (played to perfection by Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci who got an Oscar for his role)that you just want to live the life you wan to live their lives as Henry says 'I always wanted to be a Gangster' as he narrates it you understand why he wanted to become a gangster, why he chose to live this life. The way it's been portrayed by the cast is spectacular even by the young artist.<br/><br/>Even after watching the film a couple of times I never knew that Goodfellas was based of real events I always somehow use to miss the beginning and ending credits. And once I started researching it I just thought to myself Wow how Martin Scorese made the film feel so realistic that every time I watch it i forget about the whole world and surroundings and I feel like I'm living around the likes of Henry Hilly and jimmy the gent. Even the real Henry Hill said that every actor portrayed their roles to perfection.<br/><br/>This is not only the best gangster film ever made however it's the best film ever made and nothing will ever come close!"

","Another old time movie that i watched. I'm interested in watching this movie because i was looking for a most recommended 'based-on-true-story movie'. I found this movie on the list and i intended to watch it. I'm not disappointed at all about the recommendation i got. :)<br/><br/>Goodfellas tells a story about how a man became a gangster ever since he was a child, how's the life of a gangster and what a dramatic ending. Henry Hill played by Ray liotta was taking me to a real life gangster life. It left no space for fiction. It's all real. No excessive scene and very smooth rhythm. I can follow every step in the story and not being confused. It was great.<br/><br/>I don't like too much shooting fight and that makes this movie my favorite. Even though it's a gangster movie, it shows perfectly enough shooting scene without reducing the story value. Neither the shooting nor the killing scene is making the movie bad.<br/><br/>And i like Joe Pesci role in this movie. :D I saw some of his movie and i like this role best. He plays a real gangster, not the quiet one but the blabbermouth one. He speaks a lot and dare like a real criminal. Some scene i found out that he jokes too. lol. Honestly, i laugh every time he makes jokes. It's funny man. No doubt he got the Oscar for the supporting role. <br/><br/>The thing that i learn from this true story movie is that your neighborhood has a great role in what one is going to be when one grown up. You see, in this movie, Henry hill wanted to become a gangster because he saw the life of gangster everyday in his neighborhood. He was influenced and ironically his parents didn't do the right to avoid this. Being harsh isn't the best way to teach, i think. The second thing is about greed. You get greed and you'll be all done. Greedy is such a disease that everyone ever tempted for. But, we must know that it leads to one end. FAILURE!"

","Scorsese's Goodfellas is an incorruptible masterpiece with morals, wit, black humor, and cringe-inducing material, some of which the most graphic and brutal the man himself has ever filmed. It portrays the life of organized crime over the course of three decades, showing the central character who grew up idolizing the mob before almost despising it towards the end of the film. The result is a slick, unmatchable look at the way mobsters spoke, operated, and functioned from the fifties to the eighties and is one of the most powerful pictures for not only Scorsese, but for film itself in general.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Irish-Italian Henry Hill (Liotta) who, ever since he was a youngster, looked up to the mob in his home of New York City. He says he wanted to be a gangster more than the president, because the gangsters had an untold amount of respect and dignity. The job revolves around persistency, bravery, emotionless devotion where one bad choice could ruin every good one you ever made in your life.<br/><br/>Hill is taken under the wing of mob boss Paulie Cicero (Sorvino) and his loyal team of Jimmy Conway (De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Pesci). Conway operates as sort of an everyman mobster who is constantly watching his back, yet at times seems like he will crumble under all the pressure. While Tommy, on the other hand, is animalistic, unapologetic, and simply shameless, reacting impulsively on violence if someone looks at him the wrong way. Pesci's role as Tommy DeVito earned him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, quite possibly the most violent character to ever win. While Hill is working for Cicero at a young age he learns two of the most important life lessons early on in his career; ""Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut."" This begins Hill's long, relentless career as a mobster, which involves stealing, plotting, scheming, and constant commitment to the job. He gets married at a young age, to the heart-stopping beauty Karen (Bracco), a Jewish girl, much to the dismay of her mother. Karen falls for Hill's bravery, leadership, protection, and smarts early on, but realizes that once you married a mobster, you're now married to the job as well. That makes you a mob-wife; a position you can't refuse.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, we see how Hill manages his mobster duties and his overall position. This is where the very Scorsese aspect comes into play. If you've been exposed to enough of the genius director, you'll know what he does best; the stories of people who rise and fall, or endured a reasonable amount of glory in a specific point in their life. In Casino, it showed a man named Sam ""Aces"" Rothstein, played by De Niro as well, struggle to run a Vegas casino with a number of roadside distractions. He was at the height of his game once, but a few faulty decisions on his part ran him straight into the ground. In The Aviator, one of Scorsese's more recent films, we meet the unsung filmmaker and aviation expert Howard Hughes, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. There, we dissect Hughes' glory years from when he directed the most expensive film of all time, to when he plummeted into a sea of nothing, becoming a sheltered germaphobe for a good remainder of his life. In Goodfellas, we see how a man can go from being a big shot to a self-indulgent, paranoid man consumed alive by his own greed, disrespect, and betrayal.<br/><br/>Another recurring element, in pretty much every film by Scorsese, is we can see Scorsese's undeniable fascination with the material. We understand why he took the project just by the way he shot the film. We can see he takes a stern liking to the mob lifestyle, and sometimes, we get the faint impression he admires them. On the surface, and if we were to make a broad generalization, untold riches, cute Italian women, different ones every night, close friends, and fancy clubs and restaurants sounds divine to me. But they don't tell you that you must sleep with one eye open, and constantly avoid getting whacked. That part they left out of the manual.<br/><br/>The performances, like in any film by the master, are simply divine - not a single one off pitch or even average. One performance that has gone overlooked is Lorraine Bracco. She is in the same position actress Sharon Stone would find herself in when playing Ginger in Casino, five years later. Bracco is in the position to overact, but never does. She is constantly improving as time goes on, and handles her climatic instances well. Not to mention, the male performances by De Niro, Liotta, Pesci, and Sorvino are all absolutely wonderful, always hitting the correct note in every place.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is an American classic. Not a modern classic; a regular ol' classic. It is an enriching movie, with stylish writing (by Scorsese himself and Nicolas Pileggi, who wrote the novel the film is based on, Wiseguy), inevitably stellar performances, and an unforgettable score and setting that might leave you breathless at some points. The hardest part in any Scorsese film is picking a favorite scene. I think I've found one. It involves one the best jump scenes in any film I've seen recently. Along with evoking regret, naive instincts, and betrayal. It involves Joe Pesci. I will not say more.<br/><br/>Starring: Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco. Directed by: Martin Scorsese."

","There is truly no other word to describe this masterful work of art. You can't even describe it as ""a great film."" It transcends that phrase, which can be interpreted very differently by different people, to the phrase, ""one of the best movies ever made."" Everything from the acting to the music was absolutely perfect. Joe Pesci is the pitch perfect gangster, and Robert DeNiro doesn't even need mentioning as one of the best mafioso characters of all time. Every scene makes you feel, wonder, writhe, squirm, laugh, cry, and dream all at the same time. It shows a side of the mafia never before seen on the big screen: the fun- loving, rich, godly characters that really ruled the streets of New York City. What makes this film different from films like The Godfather is that The Godfather is made to make you understand what the mafia is. I'm not denying the awesomeness of The Godfather, but I'm saying it's darker and more serious. Meanwhile, Goodfellas makes you feel so many different emotions, from abject terror to hilarity. And Goodfellas is much more analytical than The Godfather (in my honest opinion). When Martin Scorsese does something, he does it for an honest reason. Francis Ford Coppola isn't random, but Martin Scorsese, in my opinion, does it better. From the hilarious and touching beginning to the dark and depressing ending, Goodfellas is one of the best mafia movies of all time, and one of the best films of all time in general. Go see Goodfellas. By the way, for those of you that have seen Goodfellas, ""You're a funny guy."""

You never see Paulie get his hand dirty yet he does wind up in prison just as the others do.<br/><br/>Tommy (Joe Pesci) was a lunatic, who not only did dirt but found it enjoyable, didn't blink an eye at killing someone for almost anything, a total out of control enforcer.<br/><br/>These guys will be the guys Henry would have as his role models the editing and narration of the film made it a really good biopic. Editing was done as an inside out technique, it would show action happening then it would back up to explain how and why?

Written by Nicholas Pileggi in which the screen play was based on his book ""Wise Guy"". He also did another biography film known as Casino, another gangster base film. Directed by Martin Scorsese again. Sound quality would be different for both. In Goodfellas it would use Dolby Surround sound but in Casino DTS stereo quality was used.<br/><br/>Lighting techniques were kind of dark, but gave a really good feel for secrecy, and confidential meetings, it came across well in the film.

","What is the formula behind making the perfect gangster movie? It has to be long, short gangster movies seldom work. There has to be a wide variety of characters, movies like ""The Hoodlum"" were dull because there were only a few main characters there. Here even the minor characters are well developed, enough to catch your eye. And last, it has to show some violence but in moderate quantities. There is some violence here, most notably in the ""Billy Batts scene"", but it never overflows, ""Casino"" had far more violent scenes than this film. If there is no violence whatsoever, then the movie can't be an effective gangster/mafia movie.<br/><br/>But what is perhaps most appealing with this film is that, in contrast to movies like The Godfather trilogy, Scarface and Casino, this movie is based 100% on real events and characters. Only a few names are altered, the rest is all authentic.Robert De Niro again delivers, even though I think he has been somewhat miscast as Jimmy (Burke) Conway. Jimmy the Gent was Irish-American and even though DeNiro is part Irish himself, he doesn't look like a typical Irish-American. Burke was also a tall and imposing man, unlike DeNiro and he always chomped on a cigar. Doesn't help that DeNiro also has that unmistakable Italian-American drawl: ""Wats da madda wit u?""<br/><br/>Pesci is just incredible and a delight to watch, despite playing a very unsympathetic character. Liotta fits his part perfectly as well and what I liked here is that they show his corruption by the mob world that embraced him in the beginning. If he had been shown as just some innocent naive sweet guy, it wouldn't look authentic, would it? Several scenes have since become classics, deservedly so. The ""Shinebox scene"" aka Billy Batts scene is perhaps the most unforgettable, but also the ""Funny Guy scene"". Elizabeth Bracco, even though not my favorite actress, offers a strong supporting role as mrs. Henry Hill, the headstrong and hot tempered Karen. Paul Sorvino is also marvelous in his somewhat restricted but pivotal part as Henry's close friend and first mentor Paulie Cicero. Frank Sivero from ""Godfather II"" is a welcome sight and his character is like a counterpart to Pesci's, a silent and unintentionally humorous sidekick.<br/><br/>Scorsese scored big with this big screen adaptation of one of the most intriguing real-life mafia stories. This remains one of his crowning achievements."

","Goodfellas is an exhilarating, nonstop joyride depicting the rise and fall into decadence of a small group of mobsters with enough determination and confidence to succeed anywhere. Fortunately for them, once they get to the top of the mafia in the 1960s and 1970s, the idea of staying at the top became regular: why think about falling when no one can touch you? Such is the mind-frame one must take into screening Goodfellas.<br/><br/>In his long, storied and brilliant career, this might be Scorsese's most technically sound and polished work. By this time, Scorsese had perfectly built his own, unique style of shooting and in this case, the material supported the visuals completely. Known for such gangster, hard-nosed films that he made in the 1970s and early 1980s, Scorsese put his talents to great use once again to create and updated portrait of the American dream as witnessed and developed by the very people who began its genesis.<br/><br/>With his fluid and straightforward style, Scorsese gives so much information about the ins and outs of running and be part of a mafia clan that by the end, the audience is more than well-informed. The voice-over by Ray Liotta is utilized in the most effective way. This is his story; flashbacks, freeze frames and other camera tricks are all used to emphasize and translate what needs to be said. There is also the constant energy of the film. Nearly every scene has a raucous feeling, as if these characters are living their lives to the fullest every night with no care for tomorrow. We get to know and understand these characters so well that when their ultimate fate is revealed, we are at once surprised, appalled, and satisfied.<br/><br/>In the end, what is important to remember while watching this masterpiece, and what will always stand out, is the phenomenal performances of Robert De Niro, Liotta, Lorraine Bracco and especially Joe Pesci as the incredibly volatile hit-man Tommy De Vito. Also memorable is Scorsese's use of the camera along with his dynamic soundtrack of the era and the sharp, effective editing with his legendary collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker. In the years to come, this may be the film Scorsese will always be remembered for. It is an American tale of what this country and a life of crime have to offer as well as all the consequences that follow."

","Martin Scorsese's black comic Mafia case history claims to be a true story, but the facts are less important than the exaggerated, hyper-kinetic style in which they're presented. In just over two hours the film covers more than thirty years in the career of model criminal Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his childhood rise to privilege to his inevitable downfall through drugs, and finally to the ultimate treachery of his testimony under the FBI witness protection program. With so little time to cover so much ground the film, by necessity, moves like greased lightning (Liotta's constant voice-over narration is almost like having the entire source book, 'Wiseguys', read aloud), and although a certain depth is lost in the process the density of detail is amazing.<br/><br/>Scorsese admitted he wanted to structure his Mafia epic like a two-hour coming attractions trailer, and that's a fair description of the finished film: there's no actual dialogue in the first thirty minutes, no real conflict for a least an hour, and no suggestion of a plot until the film is two-thirds over. What emerges instead is a visually dense and hyperactive stew of details, incidents, and non-stop music references, often suggesting an insider's guide to New York City Italian-American culture. The technique is often as violent as the subject (even with the gallows humor provided by comic psychopath Joe Pesci) and, while the director certainly deserves all the acclaim the film has earned him, equal credit for helping build such incredible kinetic energy belongs to his longtime collaborators Michael Ballhaus (cinematography) and Thelma Schoonmaker (editing), especially in the latter half of the film, when Liotta's cocaine habit starts getting out of hand.<br/><br/>Scorsese might be criticized for elevating style over substance; his film doesn't really say anything except ""crime doesn't pay"" (not exactly a revelation), but says it with a thrilling, kick-in-the-pants vitality, succeeding in putting a unique spin on a genre many people might be excused for thinking had long been exhausted."

","1990 was a decent year for movies. We have the now-Christmas classic Home Alone, tear-jerker classic Ghost, several decent action-packed flicks (Hunt for Red October, Total Recall, Die Hard 2, Steven Segal before he became ridiculous), and of course, Rocky V (totally kidding). But, 20 years ago, there was one movie that truly rose up amongst the usual pile of movies and delivered one of the most exhilarating experiences in the history of cinema. Goodfellas is a masterpiece of its genre, and would change the movie world forever. It was too intense for some, but if you can rise past the grittiness, you are in for a wild ride through the drugs, violence, humor, and money associated with life in the gangsterhood. This movie would change a genre forever, and would pave the way for several promising careers.<br/><br/>Much like the way Sergio Leone (and eventually Clint Eastwood) made classic westerns (For a Few Dollars More being my favorite) that made all the other westerns made at the time inferior, Goodfellas made The Godfather and all crime/mafia pictures look silly. That's right, I said it. Godfather is a decent flick, but it is no Goodfellas. Nowadays, whenever you make a gangster movie, you aren't borrowing details or techniques of Coppola, you are copying good ol' Martin Scorsese and his masterful directing style associated with this flick. Even television shows have a lot to owe to Goodfellas--—The Sorpranos features over 25 actors and actresses that were in the movie. Easily the best film from 1990, and easily the best crime-film of all-time.<br/><br/>Goodfellas follows the lives of several gangsters and their families throughout multiple decades, as you see their rise and fall in terms of position, power, and money. All of this is being narrated by the main character, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). What separates Goodfellas from every mafia/gangster film before and since its release is its very humble, down-to-earth presentation of its story. While The Godfather made the mafia life a larger-than-life event with a God-complex, Goodfellas toned it down and made it look like a gritty, blue-collar lifestyle that pays well and provides plenty of benefits. Also, unlike all gangster films at the time, Goodfellas didn't just focus on the main players, but also focused on the wives, mistresses, kids, and families of the gangsters involved. It was a family affair, and this was a realization that Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi clearly pointed out in their excellent script full of crisp diologue and plenty of substance.<br/><br/>Another great thing about Goodfellas is that gangsters, bosses, villains were all given a heavy dosage of human character. They were all people you can relate to, they weren't just existing and talking to progress the plot, they engaged in deep conversations about subjects that were not always related to their job. When the audience can associate themselves with the people in the film, it's a great connection, and few films can connect better than Goodfellas. It never feels like a film that is 146 minutes long.<br/><br/>Complimenting the superb writing was the phenomenal acting. Every single performance was excellent, from the small (Samuel L. Jackson) to the much bigger roles (Joe Pesci, Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta). The excellent cast of actors and actresses contributed mightily to the powerfulness, and the humbleness of the movie, as it humanized the lifestyles of mobs, gangsters, and the mafia. Even the rampaging murderer Joe Pesci portrayed was likable because despite his rage and murderous attitude, you can still feel his admiration and care for some of the people around him.<br/><br/>But the standout feature of Goodfellas has got to be the phenomenal directing of Martin Scorsese. Prior to Goodfellas, there was not a single director that perfectly mixes long shots, close-ups, track-shots, freeze-frames, long takes, and gritty hand-held-like cinematography like Scorsese. The movie lacked the long, artsy, pointless sweeping shots of most gangster films before 1990; not a single shot or scene of Goodfellas was unnecessary. For example the wedding scene of the first Godfather went on for too long because of its constant shots of the wedding events; now compare that to the epic long tracking shot of the main character entering the Copacabana. The action and the mayhem was always close-up, sometimes with a gun pointed directly at the camera, as if it was right on your face.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: If you enjoy a good film, then Goodfellas is for you. If you have not seen it, you are missing out on one of the greatest displays of perfect directing in the history of film, and easily the best crime film you'll ever witness. From the writing to the acting to the music selected to the flawless mix of style and substance, Goodfellas set the bar much higher for films of its kind, and all adult films overall. It's one of the first modern Hollywood films to not have that Hollywood touch; as it remains down-to-earth, and allowed for a similar R-rated crime masterpiece (Pulp Fiction) to flourish a couple of years later.<br/><br/>While the general public usually ranks The Godfather as the quintessential crime film, I am one of the few that will safely say that The Godfather is overrated, and it's because movies like Goodfellas exist. This film is very realistic, very intense, and full of so many spectacular moments, you'll need multiple viewings to truly embellish yourself in it all. This movie is literally only one scene away from cinematic perfection (the infamous Last Day as a Wiseguy scene ran just a bit too long). I strongly recommend this movie, as it will change the way you watch movies. And if you are aspiring to be in the film industry, it will change the way you make them."

","One of the best films ever made revolving around a bunch of mobsters (aka -wise-guys). A film of this calibre is hard to sum up in such few words. Where to even begin? It's a fantastic story-line (based on a true story), has amazing acting, De Niro and Pesci give awesome performances and really work fantastically well together. It has one of the best directors of all time in Scorcese, who is the master in this genre. Put these all together and you have yourself an awesome flick.

","Goodfellas, a film that immediately grabs your attention and doesn't let go to the final credits. The film runs for almost Two and a halve hours but one would never notice the time racing away due to brilliant structure and narrative. Henry's Narration gives this film a calming effect, he never shouts he just tells the story as if he being investigated by the cops. With the narrative, the films rolls like a dream. The pacing is perfect and not once do you hang around the same scene.<br/><br/>In these two hours, you learn how Henry always wanted to be a gangster. He tells you this in the first three minutes of the film. 10 minutes later, he a gangster and from here on, you witness the power and glamour you receive when everyone knows who you are. The acting is brilliant. Ray Liotta gives a outstanding performance while Joe Pesci is steals every scene he in . DeNiro role is not as large as one would like but he still gives a strong presence.<br/><br/>The Art design is another brilliant achievement . The world around you is portrayed perfectly that you can't help but be dragged into the setting. This is also helped by the directing which brings great style and editing that the film is like a dream. Overall, a great film"

"tmpj","9","0","0","30 July 2010"," You gotta see it.....
","When ""Goodfellas"" was in theatrical release, I did not see it. I was having a fit of ""cinematic malaise""...there simply were not a whole heck of a lot of good flicks coming out during that time, and the slew of street thug movies actually made it somewhat dangerous to venture out into theaters in some cities. A lot of us said ""to hell with it"" and decided to concentrate on our own VHS collections and catch up on films when they became available for rent or purchase. Consequently, I did not see ""Goodfellas"" until 1999. I'd heard about the film, and I must say my own legs were not long enough to kick myself in the rear for waiting so long to see it. And this was just one of the films I had to catch up with...there were a number of others. I did not think that this film could top most of the other mob-type films that had already been made. I was wrong. The film was engrossing form the outset. Joe Pesci was loud and scary...and Paul Sorvino was relatively quiet and scary...in a way that was more menacing and perhaps more disturbing than Pesci...which was acting that took quite a bit of doing. I was rather roughed up at some of the language and the racial references...it took me a while to reconcile this...they were products of the times. One thing that caught my eye--and ear--was that Scorsese kept the imagery in a kind of 1960s mode. No long sideburns or long haircuts. No dog-eared shirts...no wide neck-ties or lapels. This hurt the film from a standpoint of making it flow with time...but the performances and the characters help to overcome this.<br/><br/>The story is very well told, and Scorsese does it masterfully. One can see that he had a direct influence on Tarantino, especially when the film opens with the murder of a ""made man"" in the mob...a story that we return to much later in the film. Tarantino borrowed that style and essentially made it his own. Pesci re-defined the definition of a madman in a screen performance of a character who did not live to the end of the film...but yet will not die. Sorvinos broad range has seen him playing such diverse characters as Bible-thumping fundamentalist ministers...even a rape victim. But his stature as a tough guy is secure...one glance from those steely eyes can penetrate the audience, and you can see Perdition itself through it all. Bob De Niro plays, of all things, a character who is only half-Italian, which would dis-qualify him from becoming a ""made man"" for the mob no matter what he does. His, too, is a very broad spectrum. I have a few reservations about recommending the film 100%. It is very realistic, very graphic and very violent. But, seldom is the truth a very pretty thing to look at. See Goodfellas...if you haven;t already. If you have...see it again. It is part of my collection now."

The characters themselves, Jimmy Conway, Tommy DeVito and Henry Hill are absolutely fascinating. The way this films allows us to delve into these mobsters lives is a true experience, and it is all brought to life by Scorcese. Probably the best direction I've seen in a film. Every scene is so perfectly crafted. The pace of the film seems flawless, it completely grasps hold of you from start to finish. Goodfellas is presented on screen in a way that no film rivals. It is so true to call it the most uncompromising movie ever, it's completely original. Goodfellas is the 2nd best movie I've ever seen, better than Godfather and all that.

This movie is the entertaining itself, and because of its excellent direction, editing, and performances, this movie is a masterpiece, and one of the best.<br/><br/>This film views the mob lives of three pivotal figures in the 1960's and 70's New York. Henry Hill (Liotta) is a local boy turned gangster in a neighborhood full of the roughest and toughest. Tommy Devito (Pesci) is a pure bred gangster, who turns out to be Henry's best friend. Jimmy Conway (De Niro) puts the two of them together, and runs some of the biggest hijacks and burglaries the town has ever seen. After an extended jail sentence, Henry must sneak around the back of the local mob boss, Paulie Cicero (Sorvino), to live the life of luxury he has always dreamed of. In the end, the friends end up in a hell of a jam, and must do anything they can to save each other, and stay alive.<br/><br/>Scorsese, who is one of the best directors of all time (If not the best), probably made his best work with this one (I don't know if it's better than ""Casino"", but it probably is), his camera angles are amazing, and the narrative never let the movie get boring. And with the incredible editing, that is as good as the direction With a cast of Ray Liotta, De Niro, and Joe Pesci, I don't even need to say how mesmerizing the acting is, specially by Pesci, who make his character so hot head that you don't know if he's going to kiss the guy, or kill him. Ray Liotta surprised me in this one, and he was awesome, and of course, with the help of his charismatic character. De Niro is...

"goodfellas-foggetaboutit","10","0","0","25 February 2010"," An intoxicating tour de force
","It's as if Scorsese peeked into their lives. Eavesdropped on every conversation they had. Took note of every little thing. Otherwise how can one justify this movie that provides the closest look EVER into the lives of mob soldiers? By focusing on a group of small-time street guys - hijackers of booze, cigarettes and what-not, and narrating their story, Scorsese paints a larger picture. It is essentially this approach, this perspective from the bottom rung of the ladder that reveals to us like never before the inner workings of the mob, its rules, its values (or lack of them). The result is a threadbare exposé of mob life, a horrifying tale of greed and violence. The result is ""Goodfellas"".<br/><br/>""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"" – reminisces Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), an aspiring Irish-Italian hood who will never be ""made"" and allowed into the family, who will always have to scrounge for existence at the fringes of power. With his mentor Jimmy ""the gent"" Conway(De Niro) and a gun-wielding, short-fused psychopath Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) by his side, Hill lives his dream. He earns money for himself and for the family, but stays inside the line, because, if ""you get out of line, you get whacked"". Then the Lufthansa Heist comes along, and little by little, things start to go haywire. Fidelity among fellow gangsters evaporates only to leave the slime of violent greed. And in the end, ironically, Hill must get out of line in order to save himself from the very people he idolized. He must rat out.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Scorsese and Pileggi remains faithful to the original book and is a-w-e-s-o-m-e. No one will feel the absence of Paul Schrader here. But it takes the brilliance of Scorsese to take those words and turn them into unforgettable scenes on the celluloid. Take, for example, the scene when Henry takes Karen to the Copa through a back-door. The whole scene from the car to the Copa stage is filmed in a single shot, with a steadicam following Henry and Karen as they move through winding hallways and kitchen. The technical complexity of the shot is matched only by its extraordinary vision. Through this single shot Karen, virtually a stranger to Henry's way of life gets a taste of what power can be, of how seductive and intoxicating it can be. Scorsese redefines cinematic language in this film. The piano coda in ""Layla"" or Donovan's ""Atlantis"" will never be the same for someone after they've seen ""Goodfellas"". Yes, it's THAT powerful.<br/><br/>I've often wondered how this film is complementary to ""The Godfather"". While ""Goodfellas"" discerns mob life through the eyes of a lower-strata soldier, ""The Godfather"" deals with the upper echelons of the mafia syndicate. But they meet somewhere. From the bribing of senators in ""The Godfather"" to the bribing of prison guards in ""Goodfellas"", from the wiping out of the heads of the crime families in ""The Godfather"" to the gangland executions of mob enforcers in ""Goodfellas""– they meet somewhere. The actions, the emotions, the motives – they all meet somewhere. They meet and create the whole picture. A picture that is brutal, but true nonetheless.<br/><br/>We were waiting for the other half of that picture since 1972. Our wait ended with ""Goodfellas""."

","---May contain spoilers---<br/><br/>I had heard so may positive things about Goodfellas and had read so many reviews, so when i sat down a couple of nights ago, I was expecting nothing short of a masterful depiction of gangster life, what i watched didn't not fall short of my high expectations. The film centres on Henry Hill, portrayed by Ray Liotta, who gradually moves up the ranks in the organised crime scene in New York and eventually becomes on the most respected, feared and loved gangsters in the city. Scorsese is flawless in evoking the consequences of becoming embroiled in the deeply exciting yet wholly damaging dynamics of gangster life. The film is wonderfully directed by Scorsese in this regard and also in the depths of characterisation that are apparent in the film. Examples of this include the friendliness yet relentless ruthlessness shown by Jimmy Conway (played by a wonderfully convincing Robert De Niro) Joe Pesci, perhaps, steals the show with his chilling yet hugely amusing portrayal of Tommy DeVito with whom he transcends a brilliant mix of violence and humour. is efforts with this character were deservedly recognised with an Academy Award for Acot in a supporting role. In my opinion, the films most engaging and powerful element is the spiral out of control that Henry Hill experiences when he indulges in drug use and infidelities. The film also seems to flow effortlessly from scene to scene which makes the 146 minute running time seem a lot shorter.<br/><br/>10/10. A great effort from Scorsese, his directing was awe-inspired, and Liotta, De Niro and Pesci combined produce a fantastic ensemble of gangster characters."

I started watching it at twelve midnight and was expecting myself to fall asleep but thankfully it didn't because the story grips you and doesn't let go. For a movie that is two and a half hours long, it didn't have any boring bits and every scene was better than the last. The narration by the main character is neat and I really like it how he explained his life from the point he became a gangster all the way to the end. The acting was superb by everyone, famous and not so famous, because they just fitted comfortably in their roles. The actor who amazed me the most was Joe Pesci mainly since his comedy makes you laugh out loud but he also had a darker role as well. He played a gangster who would kill if he was spoken to the way he didn't like. Robert De Niro played the calm but paranoid gangster who gave money to people because they opened doors for him. Goodfellas is mainly about a boys life as he grows up and turns into a gangster. Ray Liotta plays the role exceptionally well but one thing that made me didn't like him was his annoying laugh. Martin Scorsese should have cut that part out and chucked into the lave of Krakatoa. When the film finished at two thirty, I stayed still digesting the film and was amazed by what had happened. It truly is a treasure and every DVD collector should have it in their collection. A film like Goodfellas perfectly explains a gangsters life, his marriage, his family and kids, his friends, his sins and good deeds, to the point where your brain is pouring out the information because it can't stand it. Goodfellas is the only film that has got a perfect ten from me in the last six or seven months. A masterpiece! Kids and adults should watch it (f*ck the rating system) and should definitely have a good time watching the best film from Martin Scorsese. The sound and music is very nice when a thrilling part comes on and it gives you a tingling sensation. ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955, is the best line in film history in my opinion. Ray Liotta says it like it was meant for him his whole life.<br/><br/>This film views the mob lives of three pivotal figures in the 1960's and 70's New York.

Together, this can only add up to trouble!<br/><br/>Paulie is one of the last who believes in the old code and the coming cocaine revolution is like a tidal wave that will reduce his little world to rats scurrying off the sinking ship that organized crime is degenerating into. Under his watch, the younger men that are like sons to him lie, break rank with their criminal common sense and generally act like they prefer stupidity over any kind of self preservation. Little remarks at a card game or bar or on the street get people killed faster than lightning.

But what went down meant becoming an informer wasn't unthinkable anymore, it was now plan B. The soldiers on the streets felt their superiors were out of touch with major opportunities and the old moustache Petes lost the battles they could never win. Drugs were and are at every level of society and Henry Hill was one of countless souls that didn't save for a rainy day because they wanted to get high and ignored the depth of the big picture.<br/><br/>Read the amazing book ""Wiseguy"" Nicholas Pileggi wrote with Henry's no holds barred account of his sordid life filling out the details one really needs to fully appreciate this film.

"zardoz-13","10","0","0","8 October 2009"," The Crime of Their Lives
","""Raging Bull"" director Martin Scorsese received his third Oscar nomination as Best Director for ""Goodfellas,"" starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, an engrossing epic about life in the mafia based on Nicholas Pileggi's bestselling biography about real-life gangster Henry Hill. This blue collar crime saga differs from mafia melodramas like Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" because Scorsese refrains from either eavesdropping on the upper echelons of organized crime management or depicting the actual logistics involved in its major heist. In other words, scenes concerning the hierarchy of mob bosses convening to resolve rivalries among their families or scenes about the actual heist are never shown. Nevertheless, ""Goodfellas"" is violent, profane, and unrelenting in its R-rated portrayal of crime and punishment. Pesci won the Best Supporting Actor's Oscar, while ""Goodfellas"" received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, and Best Screenplay based on material adapted from another medium. Incidentally, Kevin Costner's ""Dances with Wolves"" trumped ""Goodfellas"" for the Oscar.<br/><br/>Essentially, Scorsese's film traces the rise and fall of Brooklyn-born, Irish/Sicilian American Henry Hill from working as a teenager at a mafia cab stand to his adult exploits as a full-fledged mafia soldier. Scorsese glamorizes Hill's life during the first hour as a crook, and the young Hill wins sympathy as an underdog. Everything turns to sour in the second hour, however, as the mutt mutates into a murderer. After several years of getting away with his crimes, our protagonist winds up in prison, gets paroled, resorts to selling cocaine, finds himself at odds with his own mafia types before he decides to participate in the Justice Department's Witness Protection Program. Incidentally, the title ""Goodfellas"" refers to the mafia concept that when an individual works for the mob then he becomes one of mob. In other words, the family that slays and steals together stays together. <br/><br/>The opening scene in ""Goodfellas"" sets the tone for this grim film. Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro of ""Raging Bull""), Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci of ""Lethal Weapon 2"") and Henry (Ray Liotta of ""Article 99"") are cruising down the highway at night when Henry gets curious about a noise that sounds suspiciously like their sedan has had a flat tire. After Henry pulls the car over, Jimmy and Tommy inspect the trunk where they have stashed the bloody body of a man swathed with sheets. Tommy stabs the man repeatedly and Jimmy blasts at the man with his revolver. The camera pushes in on Henry watching Jimmy and Tommy kill the man sprawled helplessly in the trunk and then we hear Henry utter in a voice-over, ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" Intermittently, the Liotta character addresses the audience, furnishing important information about the mafia milieu, until the last few minutes when the protagonist breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience. <br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" qualifies as a slam-bang crime thriller. This is not a film about set-pieces like you see in Coppola's ""Godfather"" movies or Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time in America."" Scorsese infiltrates the audience into the mafia and shares many of the mob's secrets that have become familiar with film-going audiences in a way that seems fresh and off-the-cuff. Initially, we sympathize with young Henry (newcomer Christopher Serrone) who takes a job at Tuddy Cicero's cab stand running errands for the gangsters in the neighborhood. Before long Henry is earning more money than his hot-tempered father, and he loves the respect that the mobsters lavish on him. Tuddy (Frank DeLio of ""Kiss of Death"") lets him park Cadillacs, sell contraband items, smash car windows and play fire-bug. Unlike his working class Irish father who takes a belt to him when he discovers that his son has quit attending school, the mobsters are more of a family to Henry than his own kin. <br/><br/>As an adult, Henry becomes fast friends with Jimmy, who Henry assures us is ""one of the most feared guy in the city"" and pint-sized Tommy who isn't afraid of anybody. This insider's look at the mafia follows these three mafiateers as they steal, rob, lie, cheat, and kill their way to the a fortune. When Tommy cannot convince a girl to go out on a date with unless he finds a suitable fellow for her friend, Tommy twists Henry's reluctant arm. Henry meets Karen (Lorraine Bracco, later of HBO's ""The Sopranos"") who becomes his wife. There is one scene when Henry escorts Karen to a popular nightclub that dazzles her because everybody showers them with respect and praise. Although she doesn't know exactly how Henry makes his living, Henry tells her that he works for the union in the construction business. No sooner does Henry marry Karen and have kids than he starts cheating on her with whores that he sets up in nearby houses and Karen initially believes him when he cannot come home for business reasons. One morning Henry awakens to Karen straddling him in bed with a snub-nosed revolver aimed between his eyes. This is a chilling scene. <br/><br/>It is a testament to Scorsese's skill as co-writer and director that the repugnant world of crime looks so compelling. Jimmy and Tommy are brutal, unrepentant thugs. A life of crime turns Henry into a cold, calculating operator who enjoys all the advantages of mob living. Like a movie made during the Production Code era (1934-1968) that dictated that crime should not pay, our protagonist gets his comeuppance. Nevertheless, Scorsese shows his sense of humor in one scene when Tommy, Jimmy, and Henry awaken Tommy's mother at his house and she insists on cooking a meal for them. Scorsese never lets the momentum of ""Goodfellas"" slacken and this crime drama boasts enough surprises to keep audiences on their toes. Altogether, ""Goodfellas"" rates as one of the top ten mob movies and its soundtrack of nostalgic tunes doesn't hurt it."

","... Loved both. Goodfellas was based on true story of Henry Hill. This film had it all. Henry Hill started as a child being enthralled with the Mafia life. His dad just a regular working stiff . Henry was seduced by the life, the money, the excitement, the risks and of course the women. Excellent acting by all. This movie , singlehandedly , brought back the organized gang movies , we all loved from the 70s. In fact, this film was a segueway to 'The Sopranos'. Lorraine Bracco of 'The Sopranos' as well as Michael Imperioli ,in a bit part ,contributed to the fine acting. Throw in the character of Morrie and a wet behind the ears Samuel L. Jackson, and this ensemble ,was even more unbelievable. Perhaps the best acted movie of the 90's. This movie really portrayed the gang life in just under 2 and half hrs. If I do have one criticism, I think the film did not truly show the ordinary parts of life , that these people have when they are with their families, as 'The Sopranos. I did not take away points because 'The Sopranos' had all the time in the world to get away with that. This film , cleverly, pointed out how even top members of organized crime are not immune from violence or even from financial failure for that matter. I liked the narration by Ray Liotta. I think that really helped educate people , as to THE LIFE and the rituals of organized crime.This movie also did an excellent job with the costumes and the film set, to bring us back to these earlier dates. Movie can be squeamish at times, but it was meant to be realistic. You really do feel that you are a part of this group."

","The obvious comparison for this movie is, of course, ""The Godfather."" Looked at in that way, I thought ""Goodfellas"" was the superior movie - actually, not even close. Where some of the characters in ""The Godfather"" (especially Brando's Don Corleone) had an almost cartoonish aura around them, everyone in this movie seemed very real. There were no cartoonish elements to this, and no one in this movie was ever fated to be a caricature, in the way Brando as Corleone was. This was a down to earth, realistic story about life in the mob, shown mostly through the eyes of Henry (Ray Liotta), who, as an Irish Italian kid, glamorizes gangsters and gets involved with them as a kid, and then lives his life among them. Liotta was very good, as were all the main actors is this - Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco all did well with their respective parts, and you come away from this movie thinking that you have a feel for what it's like to live this life. As the movie comes to an end, and Henry becomes a snitch, testifying against some of his former ""buddies,"" you also get a dose of reality. These guys don't go to the cops out of any real change of heart or because they're suddenly stricken by a guilty conscience and decide to go straight. Henry suddenly realized he was in danger, and the only way to protect himself and his family was to testify. In the voice-over narration the point is well made that, even as he's testifying against these guys, he still envies them their lifestyle and enjoyed sharing it for a good number of years, and going straight is the price he has to pay for safety.<br/><br/>Certainly, a better move than ""The Godfather."" In all honesty, I think they're both over-rated on this site as the 2nd-best (""Godfather"") and 15-th best (""Goodfellas"") movies of all time at the time of writing. Having said that, I did enjoy watching ""Goodfellas."" 8/10"

","As far back as Henry Hill can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster. His dreams are realized early on in his childhood as he ascends the ranks of the mafia in Brooklyn, NY and then finds his life descending into a downward spiral that forces him out of society altogether. This is his true story, adapted from a novel by Nicholas Pileggi and brought to the screen by writer/director Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>Authenticity plays a big role in the film. Because it is a true story about real people, it would be nothing if the characters didn't feel authentic. Thankfully we have the great Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci (who subsequently won an Oscar for his role) along with Ray Liotta (in, no doubt, his finest role) bringing the players in the film to life so naturally. Nothing these actors do is over-done nor glamorized in any way. In fact, it's almost as if the trio personally knew the people they were portraying before committing their interpretations to film. For all of their character flaws and ugliness, nothing is sugar-coated, and the film is the better for it. Of course, it helps with a solid supporting cast that includes Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco, and Frank Sivero. Bracco, in particular, gives the viewer someone to live through the experience with, as she witnesses and comes to term with the shocking reality she must adapt to. <br/><br/>The film is no doubt violent and brutal, but is delivered with a touch of class as only Martin Scorsese can bring to the game. This film alone is a testament to his status as one of America's finest film-makers. Conjuring up images that will stay with you long after your first viewing, Scorsese makes the ultra-violence as real as it should be and brings only the finest performances out of even the smallest players in the pack. Helping to commit the film to memory is a brilliant soundtrack of popular tunes that spans three decades and serves as a stunning example of popular music used effectively in cinema. If you remember one thing about ""Goodfellas,"" it may very well be Eric Clapton's ""Layla"" and the grisly and haunting images that accompany it.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, ""Goodfellas"" is one of the finest mob films ever made and, at the very least, is certainly one of Scorsese's best. From the cast to the music and everything in between, it is complete, sweet and sensational perfection. View it, and you'll see why it was such a smashing success and why it is still considered a classic almost 20 years later."

","Goodfellas isn't your average gangster movie for starters, instead Goodfellas wander's into film history and will be remembered as one of the finest film's ever created. Scorsese has stepped back into his gangster stepping shoe's and has devised a movie so perfectly acted, directed and classy that it'l be a hard decision to name the best gangster movie ever amounted. For Scorsese, this was a simple task and one which he had visited before (Mean Streets), and so was familiar with the history of the period and the style e.t.c.<br/><br/>Scorsese excels in the technical aspect in Goodfellas. Wheather it be using flash cuts, freeze frames, crash zooms or montages, Scorsese has it all there and put's it to brilliant use.

","Goodfellas is a stylish, well executed film, and probably Martin Scorcese's best film.

Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro give spectacular performances and Henry, Jimmy and Tommy who regularly get involved with drugs, murders, heists and thefts. From what I've heard it sticks very well to the book it was based on (Wiseguy), and if it's half as good as the film it will be definitely worth the read.

","There are several good plot synopses up already, so I'll avoid that and just say what I liked and didn't about it. Maybe the few people who haven't seen it will appreciate this.<br/><br/>So apparently this is the one that re-started fascination with the mob. I like how different it was from Godfather. They say it influenced the Sopranos. I can see a little of that, but to me is just not quite as satisfying.<br/><br/>Liotta, Brocco, Pesci and the rest of the gang are all great in this movie. It's cool because of Henry--Liotta--'s outside perspective. I dig how it's not exactly easy being a mobster either. It's never quite as glamorous as it seems, and on top of that, the crazy fellas who are in that business are crazy enough to turn on you at any time. Pesci's famous ""Funny how?...Am I a clown? Do I amuse you?"" is classic for good reason.<br/><br/>Still, Scorsese has this weird obsession with making at least the last 45 minutes seem like a video for 70s AM radio greatest hits. It really gets in the way of the movie for me...big time. (I'm a musician by trade, so I love music. It's not a prejudice. The songs chosen here are all cool songs too, just way too loud and pervasive.) The big lessons aren't quite so big in this one either. That's fine, but you expect a little more from this crew. On the other hand, maybe that should be seen as refreshing. And in a lot of ways it is.<br/><br/>I would recommend it for anyone who wants a lighter mob movie, and one that seems oddly more realistic because of the domestic issues. Also, the time frame helps it stand out in a cool way. It's very good, no doubt."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","0","2 June 2009"," Scorsese and ""Goodfellas"" tell it like it is
","While the title of mob masterpiece most often goes to ""The Godfather"" for its stunning drama and dark beauty, something must be said for honesty. Those two points belong to Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas,"" which plays up the highs and lows of gangster life in cold truth, without any jazzed-up one-liners or thematic scores, with only honest-to-goodness storytelling and direction.<br/><br/>Some crime films rely on characters killing or torturing people in crazy and memorable ways, but in ""Goodfellas,"" when the only nutty character, Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), blows his fuse a few times, it feels jarring and unnatural, not cool or awing in any way. It's because to Scorsese, these people are real, this is their life, and a hit is a hit because that's how they do things -- there's not a production to be made out of it. <br/><br/>The film, based on true events with much consultation from the real life people who were being portrayed in the film, focuses on gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and how the mob raised him and gave him everything he had, brought him the highest of highs and took him pretty low -- might have even killed him had he not entered the Witness Protection Program in the '80s. <br/><br/>Scorsese isn't brilliant in this film. It's not visionary. Leave that for some of his other films -- this is just incredibly good storytelling. ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"" is not a memorable line that pulls you in at the film's beginning because it was inspired writing -- it's Scorsese understanding how to take a script and bring it to life in the best way possible. The only truly artistic work being done is some of the camera shots and compelling angles. He finds the script's best moments and adds something to them. Otherwise, he is telling this story, he is making a cinematic homage to this incredible true story as penned by Nicholas Pileggi.<br/><br/>Of course it helps that the actors he had to work with were top notch. Following him from ""Raging Bull"" among other films were Robert DeNiro and Pesci as Jimmy and Tommy. Both characters are easily provoked, sometimes irrational men with big mouths their hearts in the right place despite actions to the contrary. Pesci is particularly memorable between the ""in what way am I funny?"" and ""deer paw"" scenes, a deserved Oscar for great character work. As for Liotta, his great strength is swaying our opinion of him back and forth with his various infidelities yet natural charms -- it's a role that had Scorsese cast 15 years later would have gone to the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, so let that stand as some acclaim for Liotta. It is also this dichotomy of warm support and foul-mouthed matter-of-factness that makes us feel conflicted as we watch the entire film. It doesn't elicit pity for the mafia, but it certainly complicates the ""wiseguy"" stereotype, which I think is much of Scorsese's goal.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" only lacks in an emotional or cathartic pull. Many times you wonder why this story is being told, but then you realize how incredibly well it's told and you acknowledge that it's some of the finest film-making out there, regardless how it makes you feel."
"johnnyboyz","8","0","0","5 March 2009"," Broad and invigorating tale of organised crime and a general life of crime in the centre of last century.
","Goodfellas quite effortlessly embeds itself near the top of the tree in terms of both the best of the genre and the best of a certain director. That director is Martin Scorsese; a man whose films, it seems, reach out to generation after generation because of their timeless studies of the male who's placed within a scenario of either psychological crisis or social misfit; often both. Scorsese's films are journeys, but they never seem to branch out beyond the constraints of a city or the small, designated and rather run down area in which they're set. There are no vast landscapes or set pieces involving glitzy cinematography; just down and dirty locales inhabited by people you wouldn't usually notice or want to pay much attention to, only Scorsese brings them to life in that way that he does.<br/><br/>Such is Goodfellas, an old fashioned yarn about the rise and consequent fall of a gangster who begins life at the bottom of the pecking order before working their way up and then realising that once you're in that groove you've been searching for, you become even more vulnerable than before. Goodfellas isn't the sort of film you revisit because you're tired of Scorsese's more recent efforts. From what I've seen following Goodfellas, he hasn't made a great film since his 1990 mob thriller but that's not to say any of his films since haven't been at least good to some degree.<br/><br/>The film tiptoes along that fine line that makes organised crime or indeed Mafia life look 'cool', or 'sexy' or the sort of lifestyle you might want to get involved in. It's important to recognise that, by the end, Ray Liotta's Henry Hill has become the one thing he feared most before even starting out in 'the life' and that's a regular guy who lives in a suburban house, with a mailbox and a newspaper on the doorstep every morning. It sounds like he ended up pretty well off considering the amount of blood, violence and death that awaits rather a few of the other characters that inhabit Goodfellas, but that's not to say it's a brain dead blood bath designed to appeal to the masses. Each and every death; act of violence - Hell, even every gunshot resounds with the viewer in a chilling and quite frightening manner; whoever the victim and whoever the instigator. Some are more jarring than others, but we feel a certain something toward each individual that is involved in a grizzly end.<br/><br/>Such is the power of the character study here. Henry Hill is young and on the brink of his teen years. He lives opposite a restaurant in Brooklyn, New York in the 1950s and doesn't look at but gazes at the activity that goes on down there on ground level as organised crime syndicates go about their business. The first time he sees blood or the results of acts of extreme violence is the first time we do, when one member stumbles back to the place of business in agony. Hill meets fellow Italian and Irish American alike gangsters in Jimmy Conway (De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Pesci), both based on real life people whom, I read, are as akin to their real life persona's as possible. What follows is a study of life, love, theft, murder and honour all within a Mafia orientated arena.<br/><br/>Apart from most things, Goodfellas is a cracking ride. At two and a half hours, but never feeling like it, you have fly through the lives of these people in no time at all. Hill's voice-overs provide most of the toned down and grubby information required on how he lived as a child complete with violent father a truancy problems and when those switch to Karen (Bracco) and her, worried if anything perspective, it acts as a jolt to the audience as the mindset of a man in Henry who is slowly getting involved to the point in which he may assume himself invincible. Of course towards the end, he really does loose it as a cocaine deal and a large family meal clash on the same day in what is a sequence of events that work on several dramatic and humorous levels at once.<br/><br/>I think the most resounding reason Goodfellas comes across as so good and so memorable is its strength in depth in regards to individual scenes or moments. Just thinking about certain sequences, such as the long take in which Henry makes his way across a public street and breaks someone's nose with a revolver or the scene in which the guys sit around Tommy's mother's table and talk and eat casually, despite the fact there's a dying man in Tommy's car which is parked outside, just produce chills. One of the more famous scenes is, of course, Tommy's ""Funny? Funny how?"" tirade. Even when the film begins to remove us from the life of crime and more towards the older age that these characters approach, Scorsese does it in such a way that we're cool with the genre being manipulated and branching out into something else. Goodfellas is, and will continue to be, a very impressive and worthwhile film for many those who stumble across it."

From Paul Sorvino's Don on down the group introduced to us plays down their money. Godfather's characters just don't. <br/><br/>Sorcesse (sp) does not attempt to an effort to glamorize these characters or make their image appealing. What kept me glued was second the moral descent of Karen; it was like watching a close friend or relative ignoring warnings and making big and bigger mistakes to keep the poison relationship going.

","""Goodfellas"" cannot be described in a single word. ""Funny,"" ""dramatic,"" ""violent,"" ""nostalgic,"" and ""emotional"" are all terms which apply to the film, but none begin to do justice to this phenomenal piece. Martin Scorsese combines the fascinating true story of Henry Hill with great acting, witty humor, and believable representations of time and place. <br/><br/>The film is set primarily in New York City from the 1950s to the 80s. Between locations, clothing, cars, music, and every other aspect of mise en scene, the time periods depicted in the film feel real. Scorsese grew up in New York in the 50s, and has known the city well throughout his life. He is able to give it life. He may not have direct experience with the mafia, but he is able to represent with great effect the real accounts given by Henry Hill. From the beginning of the film when a thirteen-year-old Hank got a job at the mob-run cabstand across the street to the courtroom almost thirty years later in which he sold out his longtime friends and associates out of fear of death, the criminal way of life is nothing short of authentic.<br/><br/>A vital part of this authenticity comes from the fine performance of the entire cast. Ray Liotta's narration gives us a glimpse of his true feelings. Joe Pesci immortalizes Tommy as a psychotic character who, despite his short fuse, holds a place in the hearts of Henry and Jimmy. Robert De Niro gives one of the most unforgettable appearances of his stellar career as Jimmy Conway. Even smaller supporting roles, such as Paul Sorvino as Paulie, bring us into this world and keep us there.<br/><br/>After nearly two decades, ""Goodfellas"" remains an exemplary example of a crime drama. The distinction of this unique take, blending the passion of ""The Godfather"" with the lightheartedness of ""Fargo,"" cannot be denied. It is the quintessential mob movie."

","I finally saw this movie and it still has a little bit of a spell on me. I can't really compare ""Goodfellas"" to ""The Godfather"" because they're two totally different films. Goodfellas is shown and told through Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) whose only dream was to be a wise guy. The movie follows his journey from starting out as a youth who ran errands to the mob, to being one of the mob's closest members, and his eventual downfall.<br/><br/>To cover many of the details in the film, there's much voice-over narration. In many movies, I find that a lot of narration is irritating and at times makes me loose interest in a film since I like to be shown what the film is about, not told. But the narration is a definite exception to this movie because it not only reveals the film as a past event, but also gets into the thoughts and feelings of the main character Henry. His girlfriend Karen (Lorraine Bracco), who later becomes his wife, also has her share of voice-over. An essential part to the film is both of their narration since it not only reveals their thoughts in a given scene, but it also develops a strong bond between the two, which later spirals.<br/><br/>Scorsese's direction (who I think can relate a lot to the film, as person who grew up in New York City) is a key driving force in the film. There are many excellent shots in it that I could probably write a book on them. The one that stands out the most for me is in a scene where Henry takes Karen on a date. The camera follows them from the car, past a line of people at the entrance, down a flight of stairs, through a kitchen, and into the restaurant where a few waiters set up a table for them to be in the front of the floor show. This is the power of the mob, but everything that has a beginning has an end. I won't give the end of the film away, but the main man Ray goes from a real somebody to a nobody, which plays in the irony of the film. He gets it all, but then loses it.<br/><br/>Another main ingredient in this film is Thelma Schoonmaker's editing. I have come to call her the greatest film editor of all time, and her work of freeze framing scenes, as well as clean cuts in between scenes are priceless. When it comes to the acting, all are great, but Joe Pesci is the real master. I recognize him mostly for being in the Lethal Weapons and Home Alones, but his skills are put to the test in this film as the likable, yet psychotic Tommy. His Oscar was well-deserved (the academy got it right for once).<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" though is not a movie for everyone. There's a lot of language (mostly said by Pesci) and some strong bloody violence that may shock and disturb viewers. Other than that, ""Goodfellas"" is definitely one of the greatest gangsters films ever made as well as one of Scorsese's best!"

There are fierce performances from everyone, but though Joe Pesci was singled out for his outrageous depiction of the ultimate hot head, the film would not hold together without Ray Liotta's commanding performance at its center. Lorraine Bracco's performance as a naive dense wife who turns into an enraged shrew of a wife is like nails on a chalkboard, but I'm guessing she delivered exactly what was asked of her.<br/><br/>The film features rapid fire editing and a soundtrack that won't quit, but in the hands of Scorsese, elements like this feel like more than empty stylistics.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Martin Scorsese's name under a movie is far beyond enough to watch it without asking further questions.But imagine a kind-of-modern gangster movie starring world's pioneer actors ""Robert de niro"" and ""Joe pesci"" and others such as ""ray liotta"" and ""paul sorvino"" gathering all together with martin Scorsese who is undoubtedly master of gangster genre and dialogs (one of the reasons why Joe pesci won an Oscar for his performance)to make- in my opinion -the best gangster movie ever produced in the history of Hollywood. Apart from performances which are excessively good! it has a very powerful and smooth story and screen play ,easy to follow (unlike miller's crossing or once upon a time in America) that keep you glued to your seat all the way to the end. i'd like to recommend this masterpiece to every one who is not only in favor of gangster genre but also mesmerized by the world of movies and movie making"

","Not only is this movie a masterpiece in cinema history and quite possibly the most charming and honest mob movie of all time BUT it also checks all the boxes for cinematic brilliance.<br/><br/>Firstly, the cinematography is outstanding due to the unbeatable combination of Micheal Ballhaus and Scorsese's guiding hand that also helped shape another one of my favourite titles, The Departed. Both movies showed great camera work and a certain flare for the unique angle or unorthodox composition. <br/><br/>The acting is also superb with Joe Pesci delivering his boldest performance to date. He plays the role of an insecure sociopath with an unexpected charm (although he took on a similar character profile in Casino).<br/><br/>However the story absolutely steals the show with a captivating account of the rise and fall of small time gangster Henry Hill, in a manner only Scorsese could perfect. Admittedly I am a huge fan of the Rise and Fall (especially the fall) but this movie will intrigue and demand your full devotion to each character. The soundtrack embeds every vital moment in the movie to your memory with a classic song that subtly dictates the tone of the scene and strongly sets the atmosphere for the time period which spans over three decades. Watching a ""hit"" being performed by a stone cold gangster, shadowed by a soft love song in the background, can dramatically effect the way you feel about the killer.<br/><br/>However, an unmistakable achievement of this movie is it's ability to tell the truth unlike other famous titles such as The Godfather which shamelessly romanticises the outcome of a life on the wrong side of the law. The film never fails to engage the viewer all throughout and follows an underlying tale of how the morality of even the organised crime sector of society has its black and white patches,as well a very large grey area.<br/><br/>In all, Goodfellas is the benchmark of mob movies but also an all time great in movie history for its pure cinematic brilliance."
"hnt_dnl","10","0","0","17 August 2008"," Scorsese, DeNiro, and Pesci! Together again.
","GOODFELLAS came out in the first year of the 90s and was so good it stayed one of the best films by the end of the decade. It is a supremely confident Martin Scorsese at his storytelling best! It is perhaps his last true masterpiece (so far). GOODFELLAS is the anti-gangster film. The anti-GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS tells the sordid, sleazy side of the gangster. It is realistic in presentation, but still has that Scorcese touch of flair and the characters jump out at the screen at you.<br/><br/>GOODFELLAS is the story of one Henry Hill (played memorably by Ray Liotta, who also narrates most of the film). Henry was raised in Brooklyn in the 50s and ended up friends with a local hood Tommy DeVito, who was connected to the mob. As an adult Tommy is played by Joe Pesci in a performance that deservedly won him the Best Supporting Actor award of 1990. Pesci's speech was short but memorable (the Academy really deserves few words of thanks from anyone, but this time, they got the winner right). Tommy is a borderline psychopath who snaps at the slightest hint of disrespect towards him. These moments are simultaneously hilarious and frightening to watch, because they seem so real and Pesci perfectly relays the hotheadedness of Tommy.<br/><br/>Tommy works for the larger mob, run by Paulie Cicero (a well cast Paul Sorvino in fine form). The go-to guy though for both Henry and Tommy is Paulie's right hand man Jimmy Conway (played by the great Robert DeNiro in one of his most underrated performances). DeNiro really carries GOODFELLAS for me. Scorcese ALWAYS seems to bring out the best in DeNiro. He really seems to know what makes this actor tick. And it works to perfection in GOODFELLAS.<br/><br/>Together, the triumvirate of Henry, Tommy, and Jimmy successfully gangster-ize their way through the 50s, 60s, and 70s (well, 2 of them made it that far!). The convos in GOODFELLAS are what really strike me. They seem so authentic and scary. These guys plot, scheme, cajole, and kill with such alarming ease that it is almost a revelation that guys like this really existed. They are completely embedded in this world. They love being GOODFELLAS.<br/><br/>Also memorable is Best Supporting Actress nominee Lorraine Bracco as Henry's wife Karen, who gets narrate a small part of the film herself. Initially disgusted by Henry and his world, Karen becomes intoxicated by it and caught in it herself. <br/><br/>The biggest star of GOODFELLAS is probably the cinematography: long tracking shots, character closeups at key moments, zoom-ins to characters at important points, slightly shaky camera action, etc. It magnifies the effect of this deadly life that these people have chosen to be a part of. The use of era music is done to great effect as well, in addition to capturing the essence of the 50s through the 70s. Great work all around.<br/><br/>GOODFELLAS was nominated for Best Picture in 1990 and should have won. Scorsese absolutely should have won Best Director. A real modern classic. Heck, a classic in any time period!"

","Martin Scorsese collaborated with Nicholas Pileggi on this 1990 adaptation of Wiseguy, Pileggi's nonfiction book about gangsters in Brooklyn, and in terms of narrative fluidity it may well be the most accomplished thing Scorsese's ever done. Set between the mid-50s and the mid-80s, the semi-fictionalized story centers on a half-Irish, half-Sicilian Mafia recruit (Ray Liotta)--who narrates along with the Jewish woman (Lorraine Bracco) he eventually marries--and the other gangsters in his immediate circle (Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro, and Paul Sorvino). Paradoxically, the violent, amoral world the film depicts may be the darkest Scorsese has ever shown, but the surface mood is lighter than any Scorsese film since Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.De Niro performance is brilliant as a charming paranoid mobster and Joe Pesci's unforgettable.People think Goodfellas is similar to the Godfather but this focuses more on the blue collar side of the mob.Instant classic."
"PersianPlaya408","10","0","0","29 July 2008"," One of the best films ever
","This is Scorsese's masterpiece. Thought of by many as his best film ever, i can see why. The film based on Pileggi's book about Henry Hill (Liotta) and his buddies Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito's quest to move up the mob hierarchy as they commit a robbery and then start to kill people involved in it. Henry seems to be having a great time but is affected negatively both in his personal and business life because of his two lose cannon friends. Scorsese does a brilliant job adapting this to the screen and produces one of the best directed and written films ever with Goodfellas. With amazing cinematography from Michael Ballhaus, and very good editing from Thelma Schoonmaker and James Y Kwei, this film is a classic and one of my favorite films of all time.<br/><br/>IMDb Rating: 8.8.

"gray29","Null","0","0","17 July 2008"," Goodfellas is a gripping tale of Mafia life.
","Goodfellas is a gripping tale of Mafia life. The story is told from the point of view of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a young man coming of age as a gangster in Brooklyn New York during the 1950's. The film also stars Jimmy ""The Gent"" (Robert Deniro), and the wise cracking gangster Tommy (Joe Pesci). and Henry's wife, Karen (Lorraine Bracco) His hardworking parents make meager but honest living. Henry does not want to be like his parents. He hates the idea of having to break his back working a 9 to 5 job everyday. Instead, he observes and is mesmerized by the wise guys he sees conducting business and socializing across the street at the neighborhood cab stand. To Henry, these gangsters have easy lives. He finds the Mafia culture is intriguing. Henry is seduced by the underworld and decides it is his way to achieve financial freedom. Henry joins the Mafia and begins to enjoy his life as a career criminal. During the course of the film, Goodfellas shows that the Mafia (organization) is an alluring trap from which no one can escape. The protagonist Henry is mentally trapped from the start of his criminal career. When Henry learns that because he is not full blooded Italian, he will never is promoted to the rank of ""boss"". He will always be an employee. Henry never disputes the rule He just accepts it and continues to be a good ""earner"". Similar to a slave after the Civil War, Henry too is conditioned to believe he needs the support of the organization (slave master) to survive and chooses not to leave. Even after he witnesses his boy hood pal, Tommy (Joe Pecsi) savagely murder the boss of another family, Henry is drawn to the romance and excitement of the criminal world. To him this is a grimy but necessary part of doing business in the Mob. After taking part in the cover up, Henry is physically and mentally trapped. He can not and does not want to get out of the Mafia. He helps dispose of the body and keeps his mouth shut. In both of these scenes, the use of the extreme close up mixed with low angle and eye-level shots make the audience feel like they are in the scenes with the characters. The camera pans quickly from side to side making the viewers feel as if they are spinning or whipping their heads from side to side as not to miss a single part of the action. <br/><br/>In an effort to assert his independence, and escape from the Mafia, Henry begins selling drugs. This step toward independence is his ultimate trap. In this scene, Henry is like a rat in a maze trying to find his way out. The audience takes this wild ride with him. While is fixing family dinner and preparing his babysitter to transport cocaine on a commercial flight Henry realizes that he has forgotten a key ingredient for his marinara sauce. He makes a run to the grocery store. While driving he notices that Federal agents are flying helicopters over his car. Henry narrates rapidly during this scene. Aerial shots give a birds-eye view and make it seem as if the helicopters are right on top of Henry's car. Extreme close up shots show a wild eyed Henry who is high on coke and sweating porously. The camera pans horizontally. Rapidly moving the action in the scene and lending to Henry's manic behavior. This time Henry is tired of being trapped and chooses to escape. Finally, Henry is tired of running. Like a hamster in a wheel he runs only to end where he started. Henry's narrative relies heavily on wise guy humor. It is lighthearted in spite of the dark subject. This enables the audience to sympathize with a relatively weak protagonist. Scorsese never has Henry kill anyone. This allows him to be vulnerable and sensitive. Henry is never really reformed or sorry for the wrong he has done. But, in the end the audience sees him as a guy just trying to succeed in life despite being bound by his circumstances. <br/><br/>Goodfellas is similar to Wall Street. Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) and Henry Hill are likable guys who fall victim to their environments. Both men aspire be great. Both believe that this may be achieved through wealth. They become seduced and trapped by the ""good life"". This leads to their downfall."

","'Goodfellas' could be described as ""'The Godfather' on speed,"" but that wouldn't really be accurate. The two movies are very different. The mobsters in 'Godfather' are dignified by comparison. Those in 'Goodfellas' have practically been driven mad by power, money, and eventually, dope. At least one of them, Joe Pesci's Tommy, is quite literally insane. The film moves at a lightning pace, narration provided by the character Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco.) We see what takes places through Henry's (and to lesser degree, Karen's) descriptions, though it plays out right in front of us as well. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy, a charismatic gangster who is part of the mob but also something of a free agent; he can never be 'made' (the ultimate distinction the crime family can bestow on a member) because of his Irish roots. The same goes for Henry. He earns his place in the mob by starting at an early age as an errand boy willing to do anything, which endears him to the mob and their boss, Paulie. The violence in 'Goodfellas' is all the more appalling because for the most part, it is so casually administered. Tommy, for example, will kill anyone for the slightest perceived insult, with no more thought or regret than he would have ordering a drink. People are routinely beaten up savagely if they get crossways with any of the mob figures. But there is much more to the film than that, and I should point out there's a great deal of humor in the film, some of it laugh-out-loud funny. At times, it's like the most twisted comedy you've ever seen. 'Goodfellas' also shows how this 'community' of criminals and their families live; it takes place in and around New York City for the most part. Not surprisingly, it is a very tightly-knit group. Once Karen marries Henry, she has no contacts or life outside the extended 'family.' All of her female friends are wives of other mobsters. Birthdays, weddings, holidays... these are only shared with family insiders. This quirky little subculture has its own rules, standards and perks. For instance, there is one night a week designated for the men to take their mistresses out for drinks at a nightclub. Serving a prison term is accepted with a shrug; it seems almost all the men have served time at one point or another. Henry's first prison stint gets him congratulations from the others. It's like a badge of honor or a rite of passage. The lifestyle is very fast-paced, almost maniacally so. Everyone the mobsters deal with is paid off with wads of cash: cops, delivery boys, waiters, prison guards, you name it. Every gangster in the family carries with him a roll of hundreds (occasionally twenties); I've never seen so much currency exchange hands so frequently as in 'Goodfellas.' Eventually, despite Paulie's prohibition against it, several of the men including Henry begin dealing in drugs, specifically cocaine, which he and Karen are soon hooked on. The final scenes show a paranoid, out of control Henry totally wired from the coke, backed into a corner, the only way out being to turn government informant and enter the witness protection program. Turns out old Don Corleone, in that very different film 'The Godfather,' was right. Drugs did end up destroying the mob to a large degree. 'Goodfellas' shows that, but what an insane thrill ride it must have been... like a roller-coaster going a thousand miles an hour straight down into hell."

That is because I loved maths as a child and I still do now. <br/><br/>1.Director-Scorsese is a genius.As a child, I liked to get near people like Goodfellas. It is the same world as this one directed by S. I had the same feeling.That means there's nothing fake in this movie=real art<br/><br/>2.Actors-Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino-three monsters I adore. Ray Liotta...Mmm...A real time mob playboy any healthy woman or girl would go crazy after (although in real life I understood he is a quite nice guy) <br/><br/>3.Action-brilliant well driven. It is a dream world...but only for wise guys! The only thing that troubled me is that after the incident with the FBI secretary and jail experience, the golden age ended. Nothing would ever be the same for Goodfellas.<br/><br/>What scared me the most is that it was a stupid incident. Not a big event or a big change.No, something very easily to happen. Why did Henry choose to be a runner? Why he ended up the hunted and he had to do that stupid choice?<br/><br/>After the incident, that something just broke up. They lost the paradise.In the first half-before the incident-everything was in its right place, I had a feeling of secure and optimism and happiness. In the second half, after the incident, everything was upside down, I was scared, I needed to find a way out. I would not have made the choice Henry made.<br/><br/>If I had the time, I would see this movie every day. I am sure that each time I see it, I will discover a new detail which escaped me the last time.<br/><br/>I recommend it to everyone who is smart, tough and enjoys watching a very well done movie.<br/><br/>Definitely best mob movie of all times!!!<br/><br/>Congratulations, Mr. Scorsese!"

","Goodfellas is one of my favourite films and is my second favourite Martin Scorsese film (Raging Bull is my first). This is one of the first modern gangster films that look at the working class/file and rank members of the Mafia, compared to films like the Godfather which looked at the upper ranks.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is based on the book Wise Guys, an autobiographical account by Henry Hill, a former member of the Mafia. The film looks at rise in the ranks from a 14-year-old boy to becoming a successful member, making money and becoming happily married to spells in prison and leaving the Mafia. The film looks at the working of the crime organisation, but also looks at Hill's (Ray Liotta (easily his best film)) personal life, such as his courting of Karen (Lorraine Bracco), from an unsuccessful double date to marriage. It looks at his relationships with other Mafia members and how they work together and act like a family themselves. It does not show the Mafia as either good or evil, even thought they do bad things, and makes the character human. Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), is well played as a psychopath and this film got Pesci an Oscar for best supporting actor. The casting is brilliant, as already mentioned this is Liotta's best performance, Robert De Niro is always good, so Joe Pesci and Bracco is good and she ends up in the Soparnos.<br/><br/>This film is excellent and should have won more Oscars, especially best director. It has also been very influential in the gangster genre, from the Soparnos, to films like Donnie Brasco to Scorese own film Casino, and has been parodied in programs like the Simpsons and Futurama. Goodfellas is a must see movie."

","I first watched GoodFellas about 2 years ago and the moment I saw the murder of Billy Batts within the opening couple of minutes I knew I was in for a treat. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway brilliantly. Joe Pesci also superbly plays the ruthless Tommy DeVito. In my opinion I think it is Martin Scorsese's best film. Im a big fan of Scorsese's choice of music to put in GoodFellas as I am a big fan of Eric Clapton, Cream & The Rolling Stones. Since I watched GoodFellas I have gone on to buy other Scorsese films such as Raging Bull, Casino, Taxi Driver & Gangs Of New York, But still without a doubt I think GoodFellas is better than all of those."

","'Goodfellas' blazes a path for other films to follow. This 1990 crime drama directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the book 'Wiseguy' by Nicholas Pileggi, tells the true story of Henry Hill. The film follows the rise and fall of three gangsters, spanning three decades. In my opinion, I believe Martin Scorsese's finest work to date. When I am at home, flipping through the channels, there are only a few select repeats that I could not pass up. 'Goodfellas' is one of them. There is simply no other movie that covers the gangster underworld in a more fun and interesting way. When there is a young director working very hard on a film, deep down they are aspiring to accomplish what this film brings to the table. 'Goodfellas' elicits every human aspect of life: there is laughter, fear, anxiety, happiness, sadness, and violence. Although these guys were not the nicest of people, Scorsese somehow or anotherÂ…gets the viewer to not only identify with the characters, but understand them, and ultimately to like them. The score, cinematography, editing, and performances will never be duplicated. 'Goodfellas' will remain as one of the finest films ever made. Martin Scorsese is a living legend whose attention to detail sets the bar so high for young filmmakers, it may seem impossible and simply unattainable. This film is a brilliant classic that will be ranked in everyone's top ten for decades to come. Drake Dietrick"

","This is as close a thing to film making perfection as you are going to get in your lifetime. When I first saw this film several years ago I thought it was the greatest film I have ever seen, and I still believe that now.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is the chronicling of the life and times of Henry Hill (Liotta) and his seedy underworld dealings with his dubious associates Jimmy Conway (De Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Pesci). It begins with with his entanglement with the mob, follows his rise to power and riches, then allows you to watch, as his whole carefully balanced life comes crashing down around him in spectacular fashion.<br/><br/>What stands out for me about this film is that it does not rely on flashy special effects, extravagant pyrotechnics or a spot of the good old ultra violence (that said this film is by no means without violence), but it simply uses extraordinary story telling, a skill lost all too easily on most of modern cinema. It will suck you in right from the get go and grasp you to its greasy, mozzarella scented bosom right until the closing minutes when you are allowed to un-immerse yourself from the captivating portrayal of the life of a ""goodfella"".<br/><br/>Scorsese has without doubt been one of the best and most consistent directors and film makers of all time, everything he touches seems to turn to wonderfully gritty, seedy, gold, but I believe this to be his Magnum Opus above all of his other films and accolades throughout his career. He has a method of presenting the gangster genre I have yet to see be surpassed in terms of sheer entertainment value and depth. He also brings out truly top drawer performances from some undoubtedly great actors across the whole spectrum of the cast. Only this truly great combination of this directing, acting, and not to mention the realistic and natural scripting, could culminate to make the viewer feel some sympathy (mixed with a small degree of satisfaction at Hills retribution) towards a murdering, coke snorting, cheating mobster and all round scum bag.<br/><br/>This film also boasts the infamous ""You think I'm funny?"" scene with Pesci providing a truly incredible performance here in particular. In a matter of minutes Tommy's character is encapsulated in emphatic style providing a brilliantly suspenseful and humorous peek into his psyche.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone that has not seen it already, and if you haven't, why the hell not?!

","""Goodfellas"" is an exceptional mobster film, but not because of it's plot or script. It's a good plot, nothing too exceptional however, and the characters are pretty solid throughout, every one being a complete sleaze-ball. The performances are amazing. Ray Liotta is the main character and actually shows off his acting abilities best through his super slick narration throughout the film. Joe Pesci gives an outstanding supporting performance as the tough, wiseguy he plays in most movies, but for some reason it stands out here. Robert Deniro also gives an amazing(ly tough) and powerful performance. It's all about the cool direction and great acting for this film.<br/><br/>Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) has always wanted to be a gangster ever since he was a young boy. We learn his background and how he gets caught up with the mobsters, from the good times to the bad. Two of his closest friends are Jimmy (Robert Deniro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci). Tommy (especially) goes crazy with power and eventually these three are working their way to the top of the mob standings.<br/><br/>One problem with this movie is the lack of any soul or redeeming characters. The characters we are presented are interesting to listen to and follow, but we know each one is a violent criminal. Even movies like ""The Godfather"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" give us characters that if not redeeming, become somewhat redeeming by the end of the film and make us care about them. For all I cared, they could've massacred the entire cast of characters. I'd still have had a heck of a time watching them, as I did, they just weren't likable. Luckily, the most likable character is also the narrator and star of the film, Ray Liotta.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great mobster film, with some outstanding performances and snappy direction. However, the lack of any redeeming characters might annoy viewers who need at least one person to root for, though those people may find themselves rooting for the three main guys to murder to whole lot of them just for the entertainment value.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 145 mins.

Some of these guys lived in regular homes. This showed a side of mobsters having fear that the feds were following them or listening in on their conversation as opposed to the Godfather where they seemed like they weren't worried at all at times. Plus Robert De Niro, Joe Pesie, and Ray Liotta are all top notch names and added realism to this epic tale of crime.

It is arguably his greatest work, and it will inarguably live forever as the ultimate execution of his film-making style.<br/><br/>The ultra-tight, choppy editing of long-time Scorsese collaborator only adds to the excitement of this riveting tale of small-time New York mobsters spanning three decades. Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) grew up around the mob figures he eventually identified himself with, and became one of them at a very early age. He became partners and friends with local legend Jimmy 'The Gent' Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), also at a young age.<br/><br/>Liotta's performance is one of a man that is blinded by material excess and permanently shaped by the violent and assertive people with which he surrounded himself. He rises, falls, rises again and falls again all within the 150-minute narrative of the film, and his story is the epitome of the old adage ""crime doesn't pay."" De Niro is subdued, yet stunning as Jimmy Conway. His lack of attention from pundits and fans is only because he disappeared so deeply into the role, you weren't aware you were watching a Robert De Niro performance. Pesci is nothing short of extraordinary as Tommy DeVito, an irrationally violent man who abuses his abilities as a mob figure to the point of going too far. He meets his comeuppance in one of the great build-ups and payoffs of all time.<br/><br/>Scorsese's oft-visited themes of moral ambivalence and male assertiveness have never been so prevalent, and every single shot of the film has a purpose. The tracking shot of Henry and wife Karen entering the Copacabana nightclub still remains one of the great all-time long takes, as we are introduced to his world just as Karen is. There are several great sequences, including a montage of dead bodies seamlessly set to ""Layla"" and Henry's coked-up follies in the ""May 5, 1980"" sequence that demonstrates the virtuosic vision and talent that Scorsese possesses.<br/><br/>It's a crime that Scorsese was not awarded the Oscar for directing and best picture. It was undoubtedly the best film of 1990, and is arguably the best film of the 1990s. It is a seminal piece of film-making that influenced the ""VCR"" generation of Tarantino, P.T. Anderson and several others, and remains the most exhilarating and power-packed 2 1/2 hour film since its release. For an unflinching look at the effect of power and excess on people, look no further."

","Goodfellas is just one of those movies. It has everything from great directing and acting to awesome music and memorable comic moments. In this case, the directing is by Scorsese and the acting by Deniro, Pesci and Liotta so its all superb. Throughout the movie you get the classic comedy that comes along with Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro and some great music to go along with all these great scenes. A lot of people claim that the godfather is the greatest movie of all time. To me, watching Goodfellas is just as engrossing but more fun to watch thanks to Pesci, Deniro and Liotta. Goodfellas is just one of those movies that movie critics can enjoy, but so can your average movie watcher."
"StanleyStrangelove","Null","0","0","2 December 2007"," Terrific mobster film
","The book, ""Wise Guys"", is better than the film ""Goodfellas"", still, this is a very good movie. Told from the viewpoint of Ray Liotta who plays Henry Hill. Liotta rises from a boy doing errands for the mob to a high post, although, because he is not 100% Italian, he can never become a ""made man."" He marries Lorraine Bracco, a naive girl who gets entrapped into being the wife of a mobster and grows to actually like it. She aids her husband at every turn.<br/><br/>The real star of this film though, is Joe Pesci. He plays mobster Tommy DeVito. I'd have to say that Pesci's character is probably one of the scariest ever portrayed in film, a true Jekyll and Hyde personality who can laugh with you one minute and brutally murder you the next. Very creepy.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro plays James 'Jimmy' Conway, another mobster.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is a film that cashes in on The Godfather idea. The Godfather is truly one of the all-time great films. Goodfellas is a terrific film but doesn't match The Godfather. Still, it's well worth seeing. Be warned. The F word is used liberally in the film and you will not like the violence.<br/><br/>A-"

","Goodfellas will always figure as one of the best gangster movies of all time. It makes you transcend into a whole new world, i.e .a 'Gangster's world'. It's a world where the rules of the game are dictated by the person who's got the money & power. <br/><br/>It is essentially the story of an Irish boy, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who grows up in a gangster neighborhood & always aspires to be a gangster. It's the glamor, power, thrill & money associated with the life of a gangster that really attracts him towards it. The fact that gangsters are not governed by any law that is applicable for the ordinary citizen. He rises up the ranks from being a small time thug to an influential & trusted aide of a big shot named James Conway (Robert De Niro). It is this journey of his, which is the focal point of this movie. After joining the Gangster world, all his attributes reflect the influence of James Conway, who is someone he looks up to. Like most of the Gangster movies, even this one ends with the fall of its central character as he succumbs to the traps which are associated with Gangster world. It has the usual drugs & weapons angle also.<br/><br/>One thing which really stands out in this movie is the direction & screenplay which makes you sit on the edge of the seat for the entire movie. The nuances of each & every character, including that of the wives of the gangsters is extremely well brought out & every scene is extremely powerful. Ray Liotta is average at best & I believe that Martin Scorsese could have done with a more intense actor. Robert De Niro is his usual self, but, the real show stealer is Joe Pesci. He has given a truly fantabulous performance. His character (Tommy DeVito) is similar to the one he played in Casino, that of a loose cannon who likes to use his gun, more than his head. Who can forget the whole 'Funny Guy' scene which triggers a series of laughter riots. The chemistry of the trio of Robert De Niro, Scorsese & Joe Pesci once again comes through after Raging bull & Casino.<br/><br/>This is one movie which should be inducted in the Gangster movie hall of fame along with Scarface & Pulp Fiction."

Hill is Italian-American with Irish blood. Ray Liotta, in my eyes, then a newcomer, sets me at storm. His performance is top-notch and yet he looks like he doesn't care, this 'effortless' quality that Ray possess is great and exciting.<br/><br/>Jimmy Conway: De Niro's character is the at times sick, at times bubbly. This is a character with no set behavior pattern. De Niro catches it with great attitude.<br/><br/>Tommy DeVito: Joe Pesci's character swears and kills people with his gun as ignorantly as taking a cookie out of jar. He kills people willingly and when they make him mad for the simplest reason. An amazing, entertaining work.<br/><br/>Paul Cicero: ""Paulie"" is the one man who gives protection to wiseguys from law enforcement. So in return, he gets a part of the wiseguys' share and their respect as well. On the DVD, Paul Sorvino claims he found the quality that his character needed in his eyes when he went to the mirror to check for spinach in his teeth. (lol..) Karen Hill: The wife of Henry Hill. She's a very naive-like woman but grows depressed and frustrated with Henry towards the end. She is innocent and is unaware of Henry's affairs with Janice Rozzi and Sandy, who participates in Henry's drug business in the movie.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese melds amazing little things together in this movie that form a masterpiece. Frankly, I never thought the piano part of Derek And The Dominos' LAYLA would fit in a mobster movie.

","Henry Hill : He is a kind of child who is inclined to disorder. So by the effect of surrondings he attended to a mafia. He was introduced with James Conway and Tommy DeVito. Before he got larger benefits with them, he had been directly working for Paul Cicero who is already a friend of Paul Cicero. I think Henry Hill ask himself that if I wasn't a gangster, what would I become? There is no answer for this question and so Henry found a way out to realize his dreams. Like most of the people who has got money and fame afterwards did, it isn't easy to get used to this kind of life. He came to the divorcing point and even he jailed after a fact that trio beated a man whose sister works in Federal Bureau. The time goes and Tommy is killed by the men of a killed mafia leader. After that the whole flow of facts change and Paul, Henry and Tommy's friendships are destroyed so that Henry squeals them to the police.<br/><br/>Script and direction is upper-mediate. Actors and their performance are not needed to say lot of words. I especially admired Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito who doesn't grudge his bullets from nobody. Even if he is simply ridiculed by someone, he shoots him and he draw a cruel man image. On the contrary, Henry and Jimmy uses their brains more than the bullets. The trio reflects the behaviours of a classic mafia group. The most fascinating scene is that when digging up a corpse which is buried six month before, the words Tommy said to Henry is ""My mom is preparing sausage and pepper for us"".<br/><br/>Between the it's similars, Goodfellas could be a good example upon explaining for mafia formation.

"marissas75","10","0","0","23 June 2007"," Brash, energetic, and brilliantly directed Mob movie
","""Goodfellas"" is a superb movie presenting an amoral and very real-seeming portrait of the Mafia. Where ""The Godfather"" limits itself to a sepia palette and a somber tone, ""Goodfellas"" is brash, busy, and captures both the humor and the horror of a mobster's life. Nor do the Goodfellas pretend to have noble motivations. Instead, they're a bunch of power-hungry guys who band together for protection but double-cross each other at the first opportunity. Many admit to a compulsive love for crime, including robber Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and, especially, the unhinged, trigger-happy Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).<br/><br/>Tommy and Jimmy are the closest associates of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), the movie's narrator and main character: all are mid-level mob guys who start out around the same time. Henry is half-Irish, so he knows that the Mafia will never fully welcome him. This outsider quality complicates his personality and makes him an ideal narrator.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" runs on style and atmosphere rather than a linear plot. The first hour culminating in the famous long-take at the Copacabana nightclubshows the glamorous appeal of the mob lifestyle for young Henry. It's the Rat Pack early sixties, and America and the mob are still somehow innocent. As we follow Henry into the late sixties and beyond, the mob becomes more insular and a parody of what it once was. The women have tacky outfits and hard-edged faces; the men's crimes get bigger. Henry gets involved in drug dealing, and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) turns from a tough-but-sweet Jewish girl into a full- fledged Mafia wife.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is the virtuoso, suspenseful, darkly funny sequence (it could almost stand on its own as a short film) where Henry's responsibilities as mobster and family man threaten to overwhelm him. In the course of a single day, he must keep his drug smuggling, mafia connections, large extended family, and mistress under control, while trying to evade a helicopter that seems to be following him. The editing and music perfectly recreate Henry's jittery, cocaine-fueled paranoia. Indeed, ""Goodfellas"" has probably the best compilation soundtrack that I've ever heard: each song perfectly fits.<br/><br/>There is always so much going on at once in ""Goodfellas""music, narration, dialogue, camera movements and imagesthat boredom is not an option and dazzling moments come frequently. And its ambivalent moral perspective (should we love these men and their lifestyle, or hate them?) gives you something to think about after the pop songs and shootings have ended."

","Have you ever found yourself wondering what it would feel like to be a big time gangster? Well, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) had this exact same dream in ""Goodfellas."" Henry started working for the mob in his early teens. He eventually met the girl of dreams, Karen (Lorraine Bracco), or so he thought. As Henry and the gang started bringing in the big bucks, they also felt that they were unstoppable. Henry and the main wise guys he worked with was Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), whom Henry had been working with since his early teen years in the mafia, and there was also Jim (Jimmy the Gent) Conway (Robert De Niro). It was all going good for the guys until one day when Tommy's extreme temper was unleashed. All of the sudden the guys had to bury a made guy (a mafia man that was deemed untouchable). However, that was not Henry's only problem. Karen had been noticing outside women around Henry. As if that wasn't enough, Henry began selling cocaine despite the fact that his boss (Don Paul Cicero) had strictly told him not to get into the drug business.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's film ""Goodfellas"" is striking in many ways. It brings all those childhood wishes of becoming a mobster to life. He exemplifies the ups and downs of mafia life. The ups being getting the hot girl or driving the fast cars--not to mention getting to do whatever you feel like and not get reprimanded for it; but with that comes the downs: looking behind your back constantly in fear of someone looking to throw you in jail or (even worse) getting whacked.<br/><br/>This film shows the concept that cheaters never prosper. Although they may live a life full of luxuries and power, at the end of the day they are no better of than regular law abiding citizen. And Scorsese does a good job of showing this. He shows the early glory days when Henry and the guys could walk into a restaurant and not have to wait in line, tables were brought from the back of the restaurant and set right in front of the stage just for the wise guys. As they say, what goes up must come down and, after living the golden life, it wasn't worth it in the end. Henry is thrown in jail, he is caught cheating on his wife, he betrays the Don, who he had remained loyal to all those years, and worst of all, they have a dead ""made guy"" on their hands that they have to figure out what to do with before they get killed."

He starts off very young, and they become his family.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro are, as always, great in this movie. They play the characters that are so deranged and mental that it is disturbing; but somehow, you don't even realize it after a while, and you come to like them because of how they go about their business and how they enjoy each other's company.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is after Tommy D. (Pesci), Jimmy Conway (De Niro), and Hill (Liotta) have just killed Billy Batts. They stop by Tommy's mom's house (Scorsese's mother in real life) to get a butcher's knife for the dead body. His mother wakes up and insists on making them a dinner in the middle of the night. They all sit and have a nice Italian dinner, and they all exchange light-hearted dialogue to relieve the tension of the previous scene of the brutal beating of Bill Batts.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Goodfellas' is my all-time favorite movie, but shouldn't be enjoyed by anyone under 18 years old. 10/10"

But Hill is not alone on this one along with the returning Scorsese vets Deniro as mobster anarchist Jimmy Conway and Joe Pesci as Jimmy's colorful, psychotic left hand man Tommy Devito-whom of which Pesci deservedly won an Oscar for best supporting actor.

It's more like a documentary then an actual movie. And I urge fans and first-time viewers to pick up the special edition DVD which features audio commentary from the real Henry Hill and one of the witness protection officers(whom also makes a cameo in the film), among a hole lot of other extras.<br/><br/>What Scorsese has created here is simply put: visual mob literature.

","The more time passes, the better ""GoodFellas"" looks.<br/><br/>A decades-long examination of the Mafia lifestyle as seen through the eyes of minor Brooklyn hoodlum Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), whose secret to survival involves keeping quiet, ""GoodFellas"" puts you in the back seat watching with Henry as his pals steal, rob, burn, and kill each other off. One thing about living the good life is that it's never good enough. As Henry and wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) partake more in the money, they also become more exposed to the danger.<br/><br/>That's really the core of the story, though it's probable if you haven't seen ""GoodFellas"" you think more of it as the one where Henry's temperamental friend Tommy (Joe Pesci) wants to know why you find him so amusing.<br/><br/>""GoodFellas"" is an amusing film, very much so at times, yet like with Tommy there's always a barb that comes with the laughter, and makes for a deeper overall experience. Director Martin Scorsese and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, who wrote the source book ""Wiseguy,"" capture not only the violence but the lifestyle that undergirds and enables the violence, often in finely detailed and witty ways, like when Karen meets the other Mob wives and discovers their penchant for double-knits and beating their sons with broom handles.<br/><br/>Other organized-crime films either excuse the lifestyle in a relativistic way (""Godfather"") or pump up the volume to an absurd degree (1983's ""Scarface"") in order to sensationalize and glamorize the experience. ""GoodFellas,"" despite its bad-boy reputation, is really on the side of the angels, out to expose the vileness of Mafia living, people who kill each other over nothing and betray each other over nickles and dimes. It's hard to see Scorsese's claims of detesting violence in some of his other films, like ""Gangs Of New York"" and ""Casino,"" because he goes to it so often there, but here you meet the people before you see what happens to them, reducing the pleasure of their demise, while the killings are quick and dirty, not exploited for cheap effect.<br/><br/>That and it's so damn entertaining. Scorsese puts on a clinic, one that is still ongoing, with his use of music, tracking shots, and slam-the-door editing, like when we still hear Karen crying from one scene while Henry and his pals walk through a door to start the next. Even when you watch this film again (and you sort of have to, there's so much to take in) you aren't bored because there's always some new thing to attract your attention.<br/><br/>The character of Jimmy the Gent (Robert De Niro) is a little confusing in the film, especially when he helps crazy Tommy whack a guy he should know better about. The book explains this better, but ""GoodFellas"" is one Scorsese-De Niro collaboration in which De Niro is often not the most important person on screen when he is on screen. He's good, but Liotta is classic in the central role, a performance for the ages in fact, while Pesci made for a deserved Oscar recipient with the way he inhabits Tommy the walking Id and delivers ""GoodFellas"" message of how the good life isn't all that good, that there's always something rotten beneath the surface that will reach up and grab you at the wrong time."

","Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" is an amazing film that looks at life in the Mafia. It tells the true story of Henry Hill, a former mobster, who is still alive to this day; it also relates the story of his friends and associates who he spends a great deal of time with in the film. Henry's (Ray Liotta) grandest dream as a young boy is to someday become a gangster. As he says, ""being a gangster was better than being president of the United States."" He grows up in a neighborhood full of them, and even gets a job at the cabstand which gains him respect among his peers. (During all of this, his parents become aware of his interaction with the other mobsters, and his dad cruelly beats him.) He continues to work and become more familiar with the neighborhood, including Paulie (Paul Sorvino) who he becomes very close to later on. Eventually, he is introduced to Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) who he begins working for soon selling cigarettes. From here, he first meets Tommy DeVito, who he will also become extremely close with later on along with Paulie. Unfortunately for Henry, he is caught selling one day and is immediately arrested. Luckily, Henry is smart enough to not reveal anything, and he is acquitted of the charges. Later on, the story moves into Henry's adult life where he continues robbing the airport and other places with his close friend Tommy (Joe Pesci). We learn more about Tommy from this point. What we learn more than anything else is how insane he is. He is obviously a complete psycho, and at his worst he kills people just for kicks. Over time, Henry begins dating Karen (Lorraine Bracco) who, while she seems close to him, is infuriated when one day he decides not to show up for a date. She stands him up, and this is when the connection between the two of them is soon about more than just a date.<br/><br/>Over time, Henry marries Karen and they have two daughters. Henry's work starts getting more serious, and occasionally they have fights which result in Karen almost killing him. Tragically, Henry and his friends' killings go over the line and result in ***SPOILERS!!!*** Tommy's death.***END SPOILERS!!!*** Henry becomes a cocaine dealer and addict (despite Paulie's warning that if he messes around with it too much he'll disregard him forever) and earns a fortune from it. But, what he and Karen don't realize is that narcs are fully aware of his actions, and they arrest him one day. When they arrive on the scene, Karen, in panic, thinks that they are actual cops and flushes all of Henry's cocaine down the toilet (all of which is worth about $60,000). In the end, Henry has to become ""an average nobody just like everybody else,"" as he puts it. To conclude, ""Goodfellas"" is an absolute masterpiece. Martin Scorsese directs it with a master's touch, and the 145 minute running time truly flies by. The performances are fantastic (the best being from Pesci) in addition to the writing and editing."

","A modern classic by a great director! Ray Liotta's best film by far and an academy award performance by Joe Pesce. DeNiro is awesome. Based on a true story that shows the cut throat seamy side of the underworld. I cannot believe how many young adults have not seen this film. A must see for anyone who loves film. One of the top 10 on my list along with The Seven Samurai, Rashomon, The Godfather 1&2, Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, The Matrix, Raging Bull, Heat and JFK. Goodfellas portrays gangsters and their wives in a realistic, low life, street level manner that is the opposite of The Godfather which romanticizes the genre. Although Goodfellas is a drama of the highest order it has many memorable comedic moments. The characters are richly detailed through the narration of Ray Liotta as Henry Hill and we see the dog eat dog survival lifestyle."

","OK, I'm not going to spend a long time on this film, mainly because I'm about to watch it again and I wanted to slip in a quick review.<br/><br/>This film, basically follows the 'business' of a New York Mafia. The 'goodfellas'. The rise and fall of Henry Hill, whose story is told visually and in a narration by actor Ray Liotta throughout the film.<br/><br/>It's one of these motion visuals and scripts that has gone down in history because of how good it is. People, to this day quote from it after sixteen years, and it will continue to have longevity.<br/><br/>The cast, is superb, with De Niro and Pesci co starring along side Liotta, the films main focus. With Lorraine Braco and a host of other stellar actors to keep us not just interested, but entertained.<br/><br/>It's a very violent and profane mob movie. I am the kind of movie viewer that does not honestly care for too much language and violence. I can live with it if it is within the context of the story. I am a Taranino fan because of the sheer style more than what is depicted of the adult nature.<br/><br/>I would go as far as to say that most of the most renowned scenes in movie history are in restaurants: Casablanca, Reservoir dogs, Pulp Fiction, When Harry met Sally, Heat etc etc. This film is certainly no exception.<br/><br/>""What do you mean I'm funny, funny how? Like I'm some kind of clown, I'm here to amuse you??"" (bringing some of the lines together without the language).<br/><br/>I honestly could do without the F word as frequently as it appears, but I understand that it was a part of mob everyday life in it's frequency so I accept it. The violence is nasty, but there is no cotton wool padding in mob hits.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is a must watch, and a must own for the movie fan with broad tastes. It is worth owning as part of a collection just to see what is arguably Pesci's best scripted performance.<br/><br/>""The other day a group of kids from my neighborhood helped my mother home with the groceries.

"coolfasho-1","10","0","0","26 November 2006"," Immaculate and Villainous; it is singular in its own way.
","Having seen this film almost every other week for approximately five years, I think its time to express my true opinion on one of Martin Scorsese's finest finest film. In this iconic mobster film, Martin Scorsese idyllically illustrates the corrupt, avaricious and precarious lives of three mutual, malevolent partners who orchestrate brutal acts of irrational violence to procure money, take on business ownership, and establish naval and trucking deals to generate gargantuan sums of money. The first scene is imperative, because it brings the entire film into a whole new perspective. The word ""mafia"" is used scarcely in the film, if not used at all, because the first scene sums up the identity of the protagonists in such a sublime way. It begins with an opaque image of an old vehicle rambling along a recently paved road out skirted with dead, scraggly trees. An audible thump, followed by the revelation of the blood deluged man whose lying in excruciating pain in the trunk and the beginning narrative along the lines of ""wanting to be a gangster"" set the entire saga in motion.<br/><br/>We learn that the narrator has always wanted to be a gangster and followed by this want comes scenes of his early childhood life where he personally ran errands for smalltime mobs located in various fronts ranging from pizza parlors to restaurants. The first jobs were banal.. Innocuous store owners who refused to relinquish their businesses to the mob need only have their car windows smashed before their minds were changed. Periodically it would require more effort, such as the immolation of their vehicles altogether but they would give in sooner or later. This is where the narrator played his role. The insignificant errands, the parking of cars, the dismembering of cars and the conflagration of cars were all atrocities executed by him, but overall orchestrated by the mob. The narrator's childhood life plays an imperative role to his participance in ""real mafia business"" because it shows how ultimately necessary this life was for him. As directly quoted: ""For them(the narrator's parents) the cabstand was just a part time job, but for me it was definitely full time."" That's all I wanted to do. Manipulated by the propaganda that mob life was his destiny he isolates himself from the face of reality and follows his own fabricated truths. Due to the fact that working for the mob and being a gangster was so essential to him, he began disassociating himself from his parents at an early age and following his own whims and paths to success, until finally he had grown so attached to the strictures of mob life that he returned home to his mother one day in a stately suit, tie and considerably opulent formal shoes only to be remonstrated by his mother for ""looking like a gangster"". Another moral factor which eventually dies within the narrator in his childhood life is sympathy. When a man runs along the sidewalk, erratically vociferating that he has been shot, the narrator who is, at the time in the mob's pizza parlor, succors him, due to the fact that he had never seen a person shot and bleeding before and he ""felt bad for the guy"". In his adolescent life, the narrator meets and becomes very affable with James Conway (Robert de Niro) who is one of the main mafia mob leaders right under Pauline. Again his involvement increases and by the time he is an adult, the narrator is executing trucking heists on an underground market near the airport, a very lucrative underground market where Pauline gets the most for his ""protection"" the mobsters get their cuts and the trucking companies are deprived of their earnings. <br/><br/>Later the narrator marries and becomes involved more in more, in heroin deals, a bank heist and the assault of a certain man who lands both Jimmy and himself and prison. <br/><br/>Followed by the memorable and comical histrionic performance of Joe Pesci as Tommy deVito and the interesting classical music which arbitrarily plays during scenes of the narrator's early childhood and later in softer tones throughout the villainous executions of mobster deals and altercations, Goodfellas is an iconic classic which is categorized with other timeless classics such as The Godfarther part I and II and Pulp Fiction."

","Minor Spoiler warning Overall, just a brilliant movie. It is vintage Martin Scorsese and is easily the best movie made in the 1990s, definitely one of the best ever made in history. We follow Hill for thirty years and we see the good times, the not so good times, and disasters of the Mafia. The ending is great and as Hill reflects on his life as a ""goodfella"" you truly understand what the life in Mafia is like. All the actors are perfectly cast and Joe Pesci easily gives the best performance of his career. Overall, the story weaves together perfectly and leaves you wishing that you could have sat down for one of the poker games in the back room."

","What this film did was bring into the mainstream a life that was always rumoured about. The Godfather probably accurately depicted ""the old firm"", while Goodfellas showed us the life in a more contemporary light.<br/><br/>It is a great film. A life's tale of not only one man, but the Mafia as we may or may not know it today. It was Sopranos before that show ever got conceived. Plus the Sopranos just borrowed all their actors! <br/><br/>This film has everything, depicting a time that our grandparents discuss with a tear of happiness. It is a great example of what makes us love the anti-hero, something mafia films always make us do. The characters are funny, ruthless, intimidating and I feel non-stereotypical..."

","And yet the ending felt like a copout, an anticlimactic way for the filmmakers to get out of coming up with something better. This movie deserved a great ending, and it got a quick job instead. But maybe that's as it should be. Maybe there was no better way to end this incredible movie. It's a true story, so obviously the movie had to end a certain way. However, considering the talent involved, you'd expect something more.<br/><br/>But however much I didn't like the ending was a quarter of how much I liked the rest of the movie. Maybe this isn't how the mob actually works, but the way Martin Scorcese films it seems about as realistic as a movie could get. The narrator takes us into the inner workings of the mob, explaining how everything is done and what everyone's job is. Of course, that would mean nothing without good characters, and the main character, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), is a great one. Not a great person, mind you; he's wanted to be in the mob all his life and the movie chronicles all sorts of nasty things he and his colleagues do to other people. But the character is great, partially because Liotta is so magnetizing. One of my friends thinks Liotta is the worst in the movie, but I don't think so. We see everything from his perspective, so we actually don't see a whole lot of him. But when we do, the movie is on.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro give good performances as Hill's best friends, and Pesci deserved his Oscar for being a hothead that causes the mob a lot of trouble. But I really think Liotta takes the best performance in the movie and his was definitely an underrated one. Lorraine Bracco is also effective and versatile as Hill's wife. The two of them are more than convincing from beginning to end and the movie would not be the same without them.<br/><br/>Martin Scorcese has made a brilliant movie, never boring, always alive. He's obviously a master director, but that darn endingÂ…maybe the next time I see the movie the ending won't bug me so much. Maybe I'm overreacting. I certainly wouldn't want my qualms about the resolution to keep anyone from seeing such an incredible film."

","A lot of people think that scarface and the Godfather are the best mafia-movies ever, but to me the best mob-movie would definitely be Goodfellas...by far! Just as in the earlier ""Once upon a time in America"" and the later ""Casino"", Joe Pesci and Robert deNiro play splendidly. Although it is a very long movie it never seems to bore and the director took enough time to describe the characters. Great acting, great story line, great characters, a lot of action, based on a true story...these are just some of the ingredients that make Goodfellas the best mafia movie ever in my opinion. It shows some similarities to ""Once upon a time in America"" (not only because of Pesci & deNiro), but where ""once upon a time in America"" was rather slow Goodfellas is filled with more action and there are more characters that are interconnected. People who love ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Godfather"" will definitely love this movie! It describes the rituals and macho culture of the mob superbly"

","This is a really, really good Mafia movie. This movie ranks right up there close with the Godfather movies. I think this movie actually seemed a little more realistic than the Godfather. But don't get me wrong, it's still no Godfather. De Niro, Pesci, and Liotta were all great. Every time I see Pesci I think Mafia stooge; that's just the way he comes off in all his movies. He plays his role to perfection. He definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. De Niro was fantastic too, although this wasn't the normal role he plays. He was still a tough guy in this movie, but he was really paranoid throughout the whole thing. Every time I saw him on screen I could tell how badly he wanted in ""the family"", so he played that part perfectly. If the Godfather movies had never been made, then this would be the top Mafia movie out there."

To have three stars like Liotta, Pesci and de niro produce their best work, (first two mainly} just shows the caliber of the film. If you look at the other contenders, Brando was the star in a great film, Pacino was, also as montana, but they carried those two films in my opinion.

I saw it a few years back for the first time and remember loving it immediately but it has taken several recent viewings for me to truly realise how much class the film actually contains. Be it Scorcesses stunning direction that really places the audience into this audacious lifestyle or the casts consistently note perfect performances. Although both Deniro and Liotta are brilliant it is Pesci that is the real don in this mafioso pic. It is a true testament to his abilities that you begin to laugh with this brutal murderer, a man who in one of the films most powerful moments murders an innocent man for the fear of losing some of the macho image that a lot of this lifestyle is built on. A hilarious, powerful and ultimately fascinating modern classic."
"Merkin4pres64","10","0","0","21 March 2006"," Scocese's Masterpiece
","I have never been a die-hard fan of Martin Scorsese, but ""Goodfellas"" astounded me. It avoids the generic form of a gangster film by diving into areas where previous mafia films haven't. From drug dealing and the Witness Protection Program, ""Goodfellas"" separates itself from the generic template of a gangster film.<br/><br/>GoodFellas starts off with a flashback by giving the background of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and how he became associated with the mafia as a teenager. In this flashback, we become learned of his connections and ties all over the place that will eventually help later on in the movie. While many flashbacks in different films are unneeded, this one isn't vital to the story, it connects things together, but it's also fun to watch.<br/><br/>When we reach the 1960's, we meet Karen (Lorraine Bracco), the future wife of Hill it becomes an even better ride. Karen isn't seen much in the first thirty five minutes of the film, but once the camera pans on her, it's a pity when it isn't. Bracco's Karen is the strongest performance in the film which could have easily won her an Oscar. Without Karen, there would be no ""Goodfellas."" She is the backbone of this movie, and without a doubt, makes this movie what it is today.<br/><br/>As established in the flashback, we see how Henry becomes associated with Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and their ring of crime. While there are not enough words to even begin to describe the accomplishments of the trio, from Henry's drug business to Tommy and Jimmy's heist and hits, these scenes are a joy to watch with no place to become boards.<br/><br/>With excellent direction by Martin Scorcese, we see the director's nostalgic side of film-making as ""Goodfellas"" is basically a two and half hour long homage to the 1950's and 1960's music and culture. We see the characters become engrossed in the pop culture of the era up until the eighties when Jimmy is incarcerated after Henry becomes a rat for the police to avoid jail time.<br/><br/>There is no boring scene in this masterpiece. Everything is crystal clear and the script is quick, witty, and profane. This movie is highly recomendable and is a movie for those who love gangster films and for those who love cinema in general."

","Goodfellas is without a doubt the best mob movie ever, far superior to any of the Godfather movies. *gasp* No, the Godfather is not the holy grail of movies that some people seem so intent to think that it is. Goodfellas tells a better story and does so with infinitely more style. Martin Scorsese is the best director in American history and Goodfellas is the greatest of his works. It uses music as well as any other movie. The performances are very solid - Pesci and Liotta are as good as they have ever been and De Niro is unspectacularly perfect, as we all have come to expect. Bracco is good enough and Sorvino is flawless. Goodfellas, likewise, is flawless. It does everything that it does as well as it possibly could. The Godfather is considered a greater work only by stubborn old timers who have been saying ""the greatest movie ever made"" in a Brando accent for 30 years. An average rating of 8.6 just doesn't make sense. If you've seen this movie and didn't give it at least a 9, you're either intentionally messing up the rankings, biased, or maybe incapable of understanding the messages sent by Goodfellas."

This was Martin Scorsese at his best. <br/><br/>You can debate all you want about his early films, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets... they don't hold up to this one. It's as if Scorsese's got everything rolling on this one - seamless editing transitions, intelligent use of soundtrack, clever camera work, sharp script, nuanced acting ... this film had everything he had to give.<br/><br/>In many ways, it makes me kinda sad to see how the quality of so many of Scorsese's films have tanked since. Oh, the critics will love the movie he churns out every now and then but really they usually stink.<br/><br/>(I mean, films like Kundun - big yawner, Gangs of New York - a documentary disguised as a fiction film, Age of Innocence - enervating drama of manners) Casino is probably the only exception - it's a decent film. <br/><br/>It's frightening how a director can slide downhill so fast.<br/><br/>So, enjoy this film if you can.

I personally view Henry Hill as a sell out, but none the less a historical figure in the history of the mob. My personal favorite scenes, are those of tommy's ranting of how ""funny a guy"" Henry thinks he is!, also the violent beating and eventual murder of a ""made"" mob boss in the trunk of Tommy's car and tommy's violent stabbing, and jimmy's unnecessary shooting afterward, the worst of it all they bury him in the woods of New York, and have to go back and dig him up six months later, not for the squeamish, and weak stomached. The story takes a turn for the worse when Henry turns to drugs for cash, and eventually gets ""pinched"" and rats everyone out, this film is extremely violent, but historically accurate, one of my all time favorite movies.

","The remarkable true story of Henry Hill and the crime family to which he associates, paints a true picture of life in the mob. A fantastic transformation of book to screen, directed in excellent fashion by Scorcese; while sticking in great detail to the story of Henry Hill's narratated book Wise Guy.<br/><br/>The casting for this film was perfect. Joe Pesci as Tommy put in an amazing performance and won the films only Oscar as Best supporting actor. Robert De Niro put a top performance in as Irish borderline psycho hustler Jimmy Conway and Ray Liotta put a career marking performance as leading character Henry Hill. The supporting cast was excellent also in a film with every day believable characters all the while, despite the world they were in.<br/><br/>The film starts off with Henry as a young kid, desperate to be a gangster like the mob guys on his street, in a neighbourhood of 'schmucks' in Long Island. Henry hustles his way into the money, which he passes up to his mob boss protector Paulie. The money he scams gives him respect on the street but he can never be a made guy because of his Irish father. The first hour of the film is a tale of the great life they were living but as is the way in organised crime it can't last and they ultimately lead to their own downfall through excess and greed; something that emphasised the times, from the late 60s and 70s setting.<br/><br/>It's a landmark in directing as freeze frames, pauses, a lack of continuity at times, a forward premonition at the start and a great scene where Henry and his then girlfriend Karen enter the Copa through the back door. It's stylish but unlike say with Tarantino in Pulp Fiction it's done in a gritty sense, rather than just for show. The film leads you into thinking that although the gangster life is great while it lasts, it's an empty world where you can be whacked at anytime for anything by your supposed best friend."

","I'm sure I am not the only one on this web site who gets into arguments with their friends about which mob movie is the best. Ultimately it always comes down to The Godfather and Goodfellas. It's like debating over who is better, The Beatles or The Stones? <br/><br/>Both are fantastic movies, but offer two different view points on the same subject. I do believe that The Godfather offers a more romantic point of view of the mafia. Perhaps that is because it focuses more on the early years of the mafia. The good years. Goodfellas covers a longer period of time.Including the early 80's when the mafia began to fall apart due to its involvement in drugs.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether you prefer The Godfather to Goodfellas there is no denying that Goodfellas is an amazing film. Total perfection. From the directing to the acting to the soundtrack. This movie is flawless.<br/><br/>As much as I think The Godfather romanticizes the mafia, when you watch Goodfellas you'll find yourself drawn to the characters and lifestyle depicted in the movie. Goodfellas is THAT powerful. Are these ""good"" people? Hell no. But it's all relative. Yes, they are all scumbags, but some are worse than others. When you finish watching Goodfellas, ask yourself this: Are you ticked that it's over? Are you angry that Henry got busted? Do you want to punch the cop in the face when he licks the cocaine off of his fingers smiling at Henry as if to say, ""Busted!""<br/><br/>Stellar performances throughout make this a must see for anyone who considers themselves a fan of film. How powerful are these performances? I happen to think De Niro deserved an Oscar simply for the way he smoked a cigarette. The scene where Henry confesses that he knew Jimmy was going to ""whack"" Morrie. Sunshine Of Your Love by Cream begins to play as the camera zooms in on Jimmy (De Niro) standing at the end of a bar, smoking a cigarette, pretending to pay attention to someone who is talking to him as he stares off into the distance in anger. THIS is my favorite scene ever captured on film and it lasted less than 30 seconds. This scene is why De Niro is the best living actor. Without saying a word his facial expressions are Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>De Niro aside, the movie is loaded with talent. Hell, even Martin Scorsese's mom, Catherine, steals a scene.<br/><br/>The plot follows a ""crew"" in New York. In the beginning they ruled the neighborhood and ran all the schemes. When it all fell apart ""one of their own"" sold them out in court to save his own ass. It's not a movie for the squeamish. The f bomb is dropped constantly and the violence is real and raw.<br/><br/>It's been said that when watching The Godfather you almost feel as if you are watching a family's home movies. If that is true, then Goodfellas is like watching the home movies the family didn't want you to see. These are not admirable people. But like I said, Scorsese is so good at what he does, you will be heartbroken when it all ends."

If the Godfather Trilogy glamorized the mafia, Goodfellas certainly deconstructs that glamor as the film progresses.<br/><br/>The iconography is fantastic as it plays upon the usual mafia codes: flashy suits, cigars, nice cars and the actors themselves all serve to enhance the beautiful visual display of the gangster stereotypes used in the film.<br/><br/>Brilliant, insightful and factual Goodfellas is a must see for any gangster-genre fan !"

It permanently embedded the name Martin Scorese in the minds of millions of fans as an awe inspiring director.<br/><br/>""And when the cops, when they assigned a whole army to stop Jimmy, what'd he do? He made 'em partners."" <br/><br/>Goodfellas did many things extremely well. How could anyone like, or even feel sorry for any of the gangsters in this movie? I find myself wondering how that could happen? But that's the genius of this movie, actors, writers, and director. Some how it's acceptable to like these characters. Yet in reality they are really despicable, violent people.<br/><br/>""...It was among the Italians. It was real grease ball sh*t."" <br/><br/>Goodfellas is based on a true story possibly best known as involving the Lufthansa Airport heist in 1970. It's told primarily through the eyes of Henry Hill, who joins up with Paul Cicero as part of Cicero's crew.<br/><br/>""When they found Carbone in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff it took them three days to thaw him out for the autopsy."" <br/><br/>The story begins with young Henry, who has already figured out that he's going to be a gangster. As the story progresses, Henry is taken in by the crew and gains their trust, deservingly so. He eventually meets Tommy Devito and Jimmy Conway, partners who Hill will be with through the end.<br/><br/>Materialism is rampant throughout the story, definitely it's a significant icon in this story. They all lead a rather lavish lifestyle, and are all willing to do whatever it takes to maintain it.<br/><br/>Ultimately as they lifestyles rely more heavily on income and violence, this eventually leads to the crews self-destruction. They have drowned in their own excess.<br/><br/>""See, your murderers come with smiles, they come as your friends, the people who've cared for you all of your life. And they always seem to come at a time that you're at your weakest and most in need of their help."" <br/><br/>This is an epic cinematic event. In 1990, the events which this movie is based on were much fresher in the minds of Americans. However age hasn't changed the absolute top notch production this movie is. It is a spectacle of film art from beginning to end. The dialog is fantastic. Acting is fluent and very believable. The cinematographic aspects of this movie are as good as it get's. There's also a killer soundtrack.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of this movie since I first watched in the early 90s. I will be a fan of this movie for the rest of my life.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This is one of those movies that you can give as a good example anytime you want to mention movie-making brilliance to anyone.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" is a true gangster classic; a complete picture of the mafia and its operations. Comparisons to ""The Godfather"" movies are inevitable, but I shall say only this: both are great classics in their respective places and deal with separate stories; ""The Godfather"" movies are a riveting look at the goings-on in the life of the Corleone Crime family, while ""Goodfellas"" is a portrayal of the life of the mobsters who actually do all the jobs that some head of a crime family might want done! Also, ""Goodfellas"" has more of a ""jolly"" mood throughout the movie; you find yourself experiencing a feeling of triumph every time they pull off a job! ""The Godfather"" movies on the other hand have more of a somber atmosphere, enhanced by their sepia overtones, and topped off with a very serious and grave approach to story-telling.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" is based on the true story of a young man named Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who grows up to be a gangster in the company of other gangsters he has always admired! These include Jimmy (Robert De Niro), Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Paulie (Paul Sorvino).<br/><br/>The movie takes an inside look at the operations carried out by the New York Mob. It also shows how Henry along with his partners Jimmy and Tommy, carries out a number of heists.<br/><br/>All throughout the movie, these gangsters seem to be having complete fun, with things going their way all the time! It's only towards the end that things start to fall apart....<br/><br/>There are some terrific scenes which have already gone down as classics and only get better with repeated viewings; there's some very witty and fantastic dialog (most of which is hogged by the brilliant Joe Pesci).<br/><br/>Acting: Ray Liotta is great in the lead; but the best performances are by Robert De Niro (even though he has less screen presence), Joe Pesci (awesome, the way he mouths off the sharp dialog) and Paul Sorvino. Lorraine Bracco is superb as Henry's wife, Karen.<br/><br/>Wonderfully directed, brilliantly acted, this thoroughly entertaining movie is a must-see! One of Martin Scorsese's best, along with ""Raging Bull""."

","Good Fellas! Boy was that movie a dramatic movie. It was a great Mafia type movie, and it had an excellent movie plot to it. It was sad, intense but also kick ass! I loved it it was just so real and made you think deep. This movie was about coke dealers, and it really showed and taught the meaning of a coke dealer. It showed what the men had to go throguh, and how they dealth with their personal life. It was serouilsy pretty sweet. If you love the classic, mafia type, with a twist, then you will love Good Fellas. The acting wasn't too bad either. They prtrayed the characters really good and taught me all about the life of a smugler."

","IMDb has been around, what, 8-9 years now? I'm sure many people have said better than me what is so great about Goodfellas. Ain't really nuttin' to say other than if I had maybe five pictures to take with me to a deserted island where I (somehow) had a DVD player, I'd definitely take this one. Joe Pesci in a lacerating, blistering performance of psychosis and self-hatred, Robert DeNiro playing a confident, psychotic, but also ambitious and highly- motivated Mafia hit-man. Paul Sorvino, radiating menace, Lorraine Bracco, particularly in her early scenes where she is intrigued and unsure what to make of up-and-coming don Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). One can sense her belief that perhaps she shouldn't be so entranced by him, but as she says after she hides the gun that Henry her, Some girls would be appalled, turned off, by such violence on their behalf but I found it a turn-on. The use of music in the film is wonderful, the cinematography, particularly in the edgy scene in January 1980 when...well, you know. and yeah, absolutely the best use ever (by a long shot) of voice-overs. Liotta's Hill is the apparently normal guy whose sympathetic narration give the film its connection to a supposedly reasonable person. The story is amazing, the acting is amazing, and the depiction of a Mob in which everything is not peachy keen for those making out like bandits (no pun intended) seems fair (not that I'd know....really..). Anyway, this film is right up there with The Godfather. I'd give it 20 out of 10 if I could."

"aldrears1","Null","0","0","5 December 2005"," One of the best movies ever made!
","I just finished watching ""Goodfellas"" again, and while of course agreeing with most of the comments about the movie being a masterpiece, there's something else I want to point out...the music. Especially the use of ""Layla"" in the whacking scenes of pretty much everyone connected with the Luftansa heist. That has got to be one of the best uses of music in a film, bar none.<br/><br/>That being said, I also want to give kudos to the performance of Paul Sorvino-the understated menace of his portrayal of Paul Cicero is something you only start to appreciate after multiple viewings. I've seen this film at least 20 times, and only after my last viewing have I truly come to appreciate his performance.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci were extremely brilliant of course, but Ray Liotta's portrayal of Henry Hill, IMO, is one of the best ever to grace the screen. One note of brilliance is the last scene in the courtroom, where he gets up off the witness stand and talks directly to the audience, while the other characters remain in the background. Martin Scorcese is a genius, and this scene is one of the best in all of cinema. It's hard for me to single out one thing, because it's rare that a movie contains excellence in so many areas. I can't say enough about this movie, it may be the best film ever made. I can't recommend it enough."

","One of the main points of Goodfellas is the fact that Henry and Jimmy were not members of any family.Henry really wanted to be a made man but knew he couldn't be.I feel this is why Scorsese made the film so un moralistic. If the film was about made men then all the sentimentality would have appeared, all the fake loyalty and what goes with it. In the long run Henry Hill was a fool who found out the hard way that there is no real loyalty within a mafia family and its associates. I've heard that these days he could well have become a made man. Is this true. In oen part of the film he explains that to become a made member you must be able to trace both parents back to the homeland(Italy)but I read somewhere that now you only have to trace one."
"MichaelMargetis","10","0","0","21 July 2005"," ""As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster."" - Henry Hill
","# 1 Film of 1990<br/><br/>There are numerous amounts of fantastic movies out there, but the special ones are few and far between. One of the most special motion pictures ever created was a film that combined brutal and painfully realistic violence, grittiness, a great composition of the music of 60s, 70s and 80s, a compelling storyline, authentic dialogue, incendiary narrative storytelling and a hell of a lot style. It was known as 'GoodFellas', veteran filmmaker Martin Scorsese's extraordinary mob film, that was a landmark in cinema because it superseded 'The Godfather', in my opinion. Many people agree 'GoodFellas' outranks 'Godfather' but many disagree also. In a nutshell, 'The Godfather' is what started it all, it's a stylish, super-cool Oscar-Winner with fantastic acting but 'GoodFellas' paints a more updated portrait of life in organized crime, and unlike 'Godfather' shows the severe consequences and results that come with being a 'wise guy'. 'GoodFellas' is an amazing movie that will no doubt impress you if you take the time to view it.<br/><br/>The film begins with a grown-up Hill riding in a car with two other mob associates, the slick, cool and smooth spoken Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and the psychopathic and violent mental midget Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci - in his Academy Award- winning role.) It's late at night and both look exhausted and they hear a thumping in the bank of the trunk and wonder what is going on. They pull of to the side of the road, open the trunk to reveal a older gentleman severely beaten up and bloody pleading, 'please, don't. please.' Tommy then takes a butcher knife and continues to aggressively stab him while Jimmy shoots him several times with a revolver. They close the trunk and the camera pans to Hill's face and he narrates, 'As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.'. After that moment, viewing the rented DVD from Blockbuster, I knew I was in for a powerful, realistic, gritty but astonishing motion picture.<br/><br/>The dark and beautifully shot feature 'GoodFellas' follows the true story of mob associate Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his rags-to-riches tale starting as a poor fresh-faced Irish-Italian kid in slums of Brooklyn running numbers for low-level hoods to working along side of major mob players. Hill was a boy obsessed with how the mafia worked and like most kids dreamed of being an astronaut, fireman, or president of the United States, he dreamed of being a wise guy. The movie then follows Hill's live in the mob until the 80s. I can't really tell you too much without giving the film away, but I can tell you he encounters interesting situations and the movie never ceases to be wild and entertaining. It's definitely the best mafia film ever made.<br/><br/>There are many things to praise about Scorsese's most talked about motion picture 'GoodFellas'. First of all is the acting. All the performers, every one of them, are at the top of their game. Ray Liotta gives a strong performance as the film's narrator and main character, Henry Hill, while Robert DeNiro gives an absolutely riveting performance out-shining Liotta in almost every scene they share. It's a shame DeNiro wasn't nominated for an Oscar for the wonderful job he did in 'GoodFellas'. Lorraine Bracco impresses as Liotta's sassy but ultimately typical Italian-mob wife, while Joe Pesci is extraordinary and ferocious in his scene-stealing role as the blood-hungry and crazy paisan, Tommy DeVito, whom everyone is afraid of. Paul Sorvino rounds out the leading cast as the tough but quiet mob boss, while the film is packed with small roles played by such actors as Vincent Pastore, Tony Darrow, Mike Starr, Chuck Leow, Tony Sirico, Henny Youngman, Frank Vincent, Frank Sivero and Samuel L. Jackson. Martin Scorsese provides direction so brilliant you really can't put it into words, that should have won him the 'Best Director' Oscar at the 1991 Academy Awards Ceremony. Scorsese and Nicholas Pilleggi (who wrote the novel which 'GoodFellas' is based upon) provide one of the richest and finest screenplays ever created, and Thelma Schoonmaker provides marvelous editing.<br/><br/>There are really no dull parts about this tough and brutal but beautiful and brilliant masterpiece from one of our generations best filmmakers, Martin Scorsese. If you haven't already and don't mind a little grit (actually a lot of grit) make it a mission to drive to Blockbuster and rent this movie on DVD. 'GoodFellas' is one of the best and most memorable films ever made. I think you'll enjoy it. Grade: A<br/><br/>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT # 13"

","If not better! This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the 90's. I have to admit, I never paid much attention to gangster flicks until I saw this masterpiece. The movie is adapted from the book ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi, and I have to say, Scorsese did an excellent job. The movie tells the true story of Henry Hill(Ray Liotta) and his life in the mob. It tells about how he came into the mob, his troubled love life, and his relationship with his friends: The psycho Tommy DeVito(Joe Pesci) and the respected Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway(Robert DeNiro). The whole cast delivers excellent performances and the use of music in this movie is some of the best I've seen. The real Henry Hill once said that the portrayal of mob life in this movie is 99% accurate. I recommend this to not only mob movie lovers, but movie lovers in general!"

","One of my favorite movies ever. I have watched it 20 times or more, not sure bout the exact number. Well, I have kind of strong fondness for mob-movies but this is really the top of my chart. The one thing I like is the plot. It's not a simple plot when everybody knows the good guy kills the bad guy and there is happy-end. No... This is a life-story, I mean life. Life is so much more complicated than any simple movie. Goodfellas' plot is that complicated and intriguing too. At the other hand actors are brilliant. That was the movie which made me know the name Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci is just amazing in his non-stop talking style. De Niro this time is not the man who is always in the center of all that happens but is terrific although.

"maggiepie82","10","0","0","8 June 2005"," Scorses's greatest
","First of all Martin Scorsese is my favorite director. Second this is his best film in a big way. How the Academy missed him for Oscar here is a travesty. <br/><br/>The film has an almost documentary feel to it early on. Love the intro of Ray Liotta's character and how he was sucked into the life of a gangster. The acting is top notch across the board (even the small roles). <br/><br/>The food, the violence, the dark humor - carry the front of the film. Almost intoxicating the viewer to the glee of being a gang member till it is too late. When things go bad you realize there is no escape for Henry Hill from the life he chose. He will be killed or give it all up. <br/><br/>From what I've read Henry Hill the man is hardly Henry Hill the character in this film, but that doesn't mean much as few know the real Henry Hill anyways. It isn't as though it was a biography of someone truly famous or important in history. It is the story of a petty criminal, turned drug addict, turned snitch that is done as well as any film ever."
"jpschapira","10","0","0","2 June 2005"," Scorsese on Scorsese; Scorsese's best...Or the best I've seen up to now
","Martin Scorsese has had a delicate career. I'm not saying he has had bad times as a director; I'm talking about his recognition as the pro he is. And I'm talking about the times he was overlooked, even with this movie, which is without doubt the best work he has done (or at least the best I've seen). I don't want to say what everyone says but we've seen Marty lost his Oscars with actors turned directors in those that for most people where his best movies. <br/><br/>But many people waste a lot of time talking about those things; and I'm writing about ""Goodfellas"". Yes, that Scorsese movie that is so his as most of his projects are. That movie, one of the few directed by Scorsese that he also wrote, in collaboration with Nicholas Pileggi; who would write with him again for ""Casino"", a movie I haven't seen but I watched some parts and there's a clear parallel. In ""Casino"", it's a guy talking about how the casino works; the movement. The guy works in the casino. In ""Goodfellas"", it's a guy narrating his life as a gangster. He's a gangster, and if you don't realize at the beginning, it'll happen soon when he starts by: ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster"". ""Goodfellas"" is based on a true story, about characters that really existed and could have had talks with the movie's main actors. <br/><br/>There's an unusual magic in cinema when it comes to narration; and this is one of the first movies that dealt with that. Frank Darabont was having doubts as he was writing his first feature, based on a book, as ""Goodfellas"" is. He was writing and discovered he was using a lot of narration, he was afraid it wouldn't work. Only just then he sat and watched ""Goodfellas"" again, and probably again and again""The heck"", he must have said. ""This is pure narration"". Of course that movie is ""The Shawshank Redemption"", today a classic and personally one of my favorite scripts. <br/><br/>When you experience main characters narrating the story, it's something unique. I've recently seen ""Paid in full"", where Ace, the main character, is telling a story. He takes us to the past once we saw a glance of the presents, and talks quietly and not so much so we can presence the story. This atmosphere came before with ""Goodfellas"", where Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) talks, after we see a brief glance in a time we'll see after. He introduces us to everyone and to his most united friends; Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Henry's both friends are not telling the story; he is. So we know that no matter what, Henry won't be dead at the ending. He'll survive because he can't be telling the story from heaven; not when he stops and talks directly to the audience in some shots. In ""Paid in full"", Ace is a good man, and we want the best for him, because we know the persons around him and how they can influence him. He narrates the story; he's our hero. <br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" is another type of enchantment: where no hero exists; where we are just contemplating the story and not taking any sides. Is Henry the hero because he tells the story? No; neither Jimmy or Tommy. This is achieved by a wonderful script; trapping and palpable. As in ""Paid in full"", we get to know everyone: women (lovers or wives), who are always there for men. This is dealt with complexity, because some men have only lovers, but another are married and also need a company. The important wife role was in Lorraine Bracco's hands. Karen was in love of a violent and dangerous guy that was exciting because of what she turned into when being with him; and the future she predicted by his side. This is all correctly managed in Bracco's astonishing performance. <br/><br/>We get to know the boss; that type of man knew in movies like ""The Godfather"". The man who doesn't talk to anyone personally, is calmed, and available when needed in extreme situations. He's Paul Cicero, played by Paul Sorvino, in a performance that compares silence with noise...In the business environment, people come and go, with short dialogues; and you understand who does what...It's all too big to be described.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta carries with the weight of the movie somehow, in one of his ever best performances, adding original changes because of all the different transformations his character suffers. Joe Pesci, with one Oscar he'll always thank to Scorsese, steals the show with the movie's best lines and scenes in his hands. De Niro was already a pro at that time, butIt is something amazing to see him in any performance. He graces the screen with his way of talking, making each moment memorable; and that's one thing not many actors can't achieve. I didn't use to admire him as an actor; but I'm starting to realize, and Scorsese has a lot to do with that.<br/><br/>With that and with everything, Marty is hidden behind every little detail in this film. Again, he puts his own visions into the screen, so you can see he's there. Sometimes his camera knows more than the storyteller; sometimes it knows nothing, and it really doesn't need toIt can be living the moment, or planning that violence Scorsese is always willing to release, just to mix it with the characters' deepest feelings. <br/><br/>Scorsese, like Jimmy, Henry, Tommy or any other says; is a ""good fella"". ""He's with us, he's OK, you can hang out with him; he's a good fellaYou know?"". And his ""Goodfellas"" is another underrated cinematographic brilliance; as one of those all-time movie classics."

","There is a fascination with the underworld that exists in everyone. We find ourselves drawn to the headlines of gang wars and those caught in the middle. After all, Al Copone was a crook, but also a celebrity. It is this fascination that has captivated audiences with gangster pictures from the 1930s with James Cagney in ""The Public Enemy"" to the more recent ""Goodfellas"" from director Martin Scorsese. The latter picture, with its sense of realism, like ""The Public Enemy"" stands the test of time. Its characters are every bit as terrifying, especially Tommy De Vito played by Joe Pesci as was Cagney's portrayal of Tom Powers. And of course with Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta, one can only expect explosive portrayals. <br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" tells the story of Henry Hill (Liotta), who from childhood had aspirations of being a gangster. He starts out small, parking Cadillacs for wise guys and eventually works his way up to top of the food chain. By the time he is 21, he has more money than anyone else does his age, a sexy girlfriend, and the respect of the mob. Henry soon teams up with Tommy De Vito (Pesci) and the two work the streets with Jimmy Conway (De Niro) for Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino). What begins, as robbery becomes another crime: murder, extortion, booze, etc. But after Henry gets married and finds himself rooted deeper into the mob, he begins to take on more than he can handle. Director Scorsese grew up on the streets of New York and witnessed the rough life that people could have. He incorporates his own history into the characters of the film. This is a common practice in most of his films from ""Raging Bull,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" and ""Mean Streets,"" as he has a fascination and love for the Big Apple. But the most obvious aspect of that life is the violence. It is portrayed in ""Goodfellas"" from a realistic point of view. Scorsese does not hide the blood. He does not hide way people die or where they may end up. He simply shows the gut-wrenching reality of the mob world as is. The most affective example of that realistic violence is Pesci's performance, which garnered him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1990. Tommy's character is a homicidal maniac, and a reminder of Cagney's performance in ""White Heat."" Pesci is horrifying to watch in action. From the opening scene where he stabs a body that is not quite dead, to his shooting of a young man named Spider who is slow to serve him a drink, the man is simply on fire. Pesci had a similar affect in ""Raging Bull."" As such, ""Goodfellas"" is Pesci's ""Raging Bull."" A scene in ""Raging Bull"" shows Pesci throwing a drink in a guy's face, then after a merciless beating, drags the guy out onto the street and repeatedly thrashes the man with a car door as the man's body lays half in the car and half outside it. The scene is horrific, but also enthralling. What is even more affective is Scorsese's use of music throughout the film. The time frame ranges from the 1960s to the late 1980s and the film's soundtrack plays like a time warp. The best use of music is Eric Clapton's ""Layla,"" in which Scorsese plays the song's last four minutesa piano and guitar duo that masterfully captures the feeling for the events in the film. Ultimately, ""Goodfellas"" is the equivalent of a mob-epic. Like the gangster pictures of the 1930s, there is also social commentaryit is the government that tries to crack down on these criminals, however, it is the police and other public sectors that are hand-in-hand with the moband little is ever done to change the situation. ****"
"LibertyValance27-1","10","0","0","24 February 2005"," Scorsese's swan song!
","This film is arguably the best in the Scorsese cannon. In ""Goodfellas"" Scorsese seems to have created the quintessential gangster picture.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" follows the career of a small time hood, named Henry Hil (Ray Liotta) who was friends with members of (but never really admitted into) the New York mafia. Hill, who would eventually betray and testify against his mafia cronies is not shown here as a sympathetic character by Scorsese, just as a young boy who grew up idolizing gangsters and then working for gangsters and then eventually befriending many of them. What he witnessed and saw while hanging around many of the members of the mob, later was used against them in their trial by Henry who became a witness for the prosecution. <br/><br/>Scorsese does a magnificent job of introducing us into this fascinating world of the mafia. His attention to detail creates a vivid portrayal of the world that these gangsters exist in. He puts us front row center, as he introduces us (literally) to many different members of the mafia and takes us on their bloody adventures and allows us an unflinching view of the violence that was an everyday part of that world. With montages and voice overs, we are saturated with these characters, offering us a view into their mind, and their feelings and fears. Towards the end of the film, Scorsese creates a paranoid, and frantic montage that climaxes just has he pushes us to the edge of our seats and frays our nerves.<br/><br/>There are fantastic performances by Robert DeNiro,Lorraine Bracco, and Ray Liotta, in what I consider to be his best film role ever. Joe Pesci achieved world renown fame as the short, funny,foul mouthed, homicidal gangster in this film (""What do ya mean I'm funny?!"") and the supporting cast is equally good and give this film a aurora of authenticity.<br/><br/>Scorsese is a wonderful director with many great films in his cannon, however after a couple of viewing of ""Goodfellas"" I think you will agree that this is his finest film."

","'Goodfellas', alongside 'Pulp Fiction' stands as my all time favorite film. Based on Nicolas Pillegi's outstanding novel the screenplay is intelligent and thrilling and gives credence to each performer. In crime movies the female leads (if any) are whiny and one dimensional but Lorraine Bracco's Oscar nominated perfromance is brilliant and her character is as dimensional as Henry (a slightly disappointing Ray Liotta, he rushes the voice-over and much of his dialogue). Jimmy (forget Raging Bull, this is DeNiro's greatest performance)Conway is pure genius and Pesci is great as the plain insane Tommy DeVito.<br/><br/>Scorcese directs with a fast moving and in your face visual style and punctuates the soundtrack with some of the best rock/pop songs of the sixties and seventies, ending with Sid Viscous's 'My Way' was a stroke of genius and putting 'Down Below the Ocean' over the Batt's murder was insane but it worked because it goes against the grain.<br/><br/>People say the Godfather is the greatest crime movie ever and perhaps they are right. But I have to disagree, 'Goodfellas' is more energetic more exciting and most importantly more FUN than the dreary, boring Godfather's.<br/><br/>A flat out, awe inspiring, no-one will ever make a film as good as this again MASTERPIECE.<br/><br/>10/10"

"FrankBooth_DeLarge","10","0","0","16 January 2005"," One of the best and most entertaining films of the 90's
","Goodfellas was one of the first great crime movies of the 90's. The 90's was an extraordinary decade with crime films like Silence Of The Lambs, Reservoir Dogs, L.A. Confidential, Fargo, Pulp Fiction, Se7en, and The Usual Suspects.<br/><br/>Goodfellas follows the life of Henry Hill(Ray Liota) who grows up to be a gangster. The direction by Martin Scorcese keeps your interest in the film from the way the film starts to the way the film ends. He is really good with keeping the flow of the story going and not letting it drag out or go slow at any time. The film allows you to meet the characters and see what they are like, such as the cool guy gangster Jimmy Conway(Robert De Niro) and the hot headed Tommy Devito(Joe Pesci).<br/><br/>The story follows Henry from the age of 14 on up. It shows how he becomes part of the mob, how he gets married to Karen Hill(played by Lorraine Bracco who later on played Dr. Melfi in The Sopranos). Other things happen throughout the story such as Henry having kids, getting involved in drugs, going to prison. The story really comes together when(spoiler ahead) the mobsters all decided to get involved in a heist. It seemed like the perfect plan until something goes wrong with one of the people involved. This is when things involving the heist heat up and most of the people involved in the heist get whacked. After this is when a lot of events from early on in the movie comes into play.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen. In just 2 1/2 hours it accomplished more than a lot of other mob films have. Director Martin Scorcese does a lot of good techniques to keep the film moving and make time go by without getting real slow. Everybody who wants to see a mob movie that is worth watching with plenty of entertainment should see Goodfellas."
"OllieZ","10","0","0","21 December 2004"," My favourite film.
","To me, this is the best film ever made. A bold statement you may think, but I the minute I saw Henry Hill utter the famous line of: ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster"", followed by the kick of Tony Bennet's Rags to Riches, I knew I was in for something special.<br/><br/>In the hands of any other director, this could have been a straightforward adaptation of Pileggi's ""Wise Guy"". Yet with Scorsese, the film is injected with an important dose of life - something I thought was slightly missing from The Godfather series. The relationships are so close and warm between these goodfellas, something that was absent from the cold relationships in Casino(1995).<br/><br/>The actors react well to each other - the main actors being superb. Liotta has never been better as he was as Henry Hill, the man seduced by the mob life. Pesci never reached the great heights he did in this film, as the only 5ft5 man I know who can scare me. De Niro is doing what he does best, and that is playing the gangster, but in an understated fashion, never going into parody. Yet like most good films, it is the small things that make a difference - and there is no exception here. Even the minor roles are fully fleshed out, as if there is a life behind the story of Hnery Hill. Like Mickey Eyes...or Anthony...Jimmy Two Times (on the account that he says everything twice). The sheer density of the characters is to be commended.<br/><br/>Scorsese has the knack of timing his music to the action that occurs on screen. But this isn't just a song played in its entirety (something Tarantino would do) - instead Scorsese chops and changes his songs, halfway through a scene. Take for example the ""1980's"" scenes, where Hill is in a fit of paranoia whilst delivering the guns to Jimmy and picking up drugs for himself. From the start of this powerful section of the film, we get Nilsson's ""jump into the fire"", followed by some Muddy Waters, mixed in with the Stones - to a dizzying effect, until we end this section with ""Jump into the fire"" again. Pure genius.<br/><br/>This is also seen in the ""Layla"" montage - the piano exit of Eric Clapton's Layla introducing us to the fall of the gangsters who knew too much about the heist. From the pink cadilac, to the meat locker with Frankie Carbone in it - it is a beautiful scene, with so many great techniques on offer. I could go on forever with the amount of great scenes in this movie that work with the music (Billy Batts murder with Donovan's Atlantis...Tracking shot of Jimmy with Cream's Sunshine of my love...) - but that is for you to watch and experience.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is a film lovers film. It has a great story (great narration too), superb acting from all, beautiful cinematography (Copacobana scene comes to mind, also with the visceral tracking shots) and the all seeing eye - Scorsese. Goodfellas is a film that is as violent as it is funny, a sense of humour in Scorsese's work also seen in King of Comedy and After Hours. This is Scorsese's (and in my humble opinion any director's) work. That is something considering how fantastic Raging Bull and Taxi Driver are.<br/><br/>Visceral, violent and film lover's dream."

The film keeps you there for so long, until a certain point where you see the drugs and random hits take over the mafia world, bosses taking on bosses, wars. As the film comes to its close, like henry is trying to get out you want out of this world as well, because it is'nt what it once was. You see the godfather never made you feel like you wanted out, the family unit aspect was so tight, Mario puza could'nt have written that story any better, and coppola just knew what to do. The question is in goodfellas was the highest high worth the lowest low, and did it make you feel more comfortable than the family environment in the godfather, well thats up to you as the viewer to decide.

","From the opening script ""From as far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a gangster"" to the ending script ""I now live like an average nobody, a schnook""...the film culminates the real-life story of Henry Hill, an Irish-Italian hoodlum growing up in New York in the 1950s and 1960s with aspirations of becoming a mobster. <br/><br/>For any person who finds distaste with this film due to the violence, language and content, I ask you to consider this... The reason this film is so superb is that it takes us into the intimate life of a person who was not ""an average nobody"" to quote the movie. Most people find this interesting, enthralling and profoundly entertaining because it is unique to the lives 90% of us lead. A film is supposed to be all of these things. <br/><br/>For any person who found this film magnificently scripted, acted and directed - I would heartily agree. It is the BEST gangster film ever made. Ever.<br/><br/>Why is this film so darn good? I think for several reasons:<br/><br/>1. The acting. The actors casted are believable. They are not typical ""Hollywoodized"" actors and actresses. Not cosmetically enhanced, wafer-thin or highly buffed, plastic. They are excellent at their craft and you think to yourself ""I really could have know a person like this"". It adds realism to the film. Too many films are made that are simply unreal (whether it be the plot, special effects or actors), and that is not entertaining...it is a bore. <br/><br/>2. The directing. The film direction, mixed with voice overs and unique camera shots, captures the audience from the start of the film to the end in a wonderful, compelling storytelling event.<br/><br/>3. The musical score. Henry Hill's story begins in the 1950s when he was a boy and ends in the 1980s when he is arrested for narcotics dealing and enters the Witness Protection Program as the only option of salvation. The music parallels Henry's life and brings back the nostalgia of that time.<br/><br/>4. A darn good story. Henry Hill's story, based on the book by Nicholas Pileggi, is just a fascinating tale.<br/><br/>I choose not to discuss details of the film as the film speaks for itself. I highly recommend it."

The actors are superb although De Niro's part is not much more than a cameo and Pesci was identical in Casino (to the point where you wondered why they didn't just use outtakes from Goodfellas for that film, or maybe they did ...!)<br/><br/>It tells the story of a gangster, Henry Hill (based on a true story, apparently pretty closely too), from his childhood introduction to the mob through to his predictably messy ending (I won't add plot spoilers).

","""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a Gangster"". This classic line by Ray Liotta's character Henry Hill has been heard numerous times, and it starts of Martin Scorsese's unforgettable Gangster-movie ""GoodFellas""...<br/><br/>This film portrays the life of the mob in a way that (at the time) had never been seen before. We follow Henry Hill who as a young kid watches the way the gangsters in his neighborhood takes over the whole city and rises to great power. He starts working for them, doing minor jobs. But later he would become one of the most important persons in the whole dynasty.<br/><br/>What really has to be said about this film is that it's TOP entertainment. I've watched ""GoodFellas"" about 5-6 times since I bought it some years ago, and it's just as entertaining every time. The film is so masterful at every point, that it's just a joy to watch. But what's making Gangster-films like this so enjoying? If you think about it...everybody wants to be a gangster. We all want the money, the glamour and the power. Which guy wouldn't want to walk around, wearing those shiny suits, getting all those women and doing WHATEVER he wants? ***Spoiler Following*** But then again...many of the well-known Gangster-movies also shows the down-side of the gangster-life, and doesn't exactly have an happy ending. This film is one of them. ***End Of Spoiler***.<br/><br/>When this film came, back in 1990, I'm sure it was breaking grounds. Being a gangster has never looked better. Unlike the ""dead-serious"" films people had seen earlier, this film had lots of charm and funny gangster-humor. That's why it makes the gangster-life look so lovely. Scorsese also shows us some of the coolest and most stylish gangster-characters ever seen on film. And these characters are being brought to us by actors like Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino, who is all giving some terrific and unforgettable performances. Pesci who won the Oscar Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, steals the show in about every scene where his character Tommy DeVito is involved. A funny, short guy, with an even shorter temper, that you'll never forget. De Niro is just as good as we know he can be, in his role as the mob-veteran Jimmy Conway, and Paul Sorvino plays Paul Cicero, the boss of the dynasty, in an absolutely convincing way. The main-character Henry Hill is played by an impressive Ray Liotta, which I have never seen better.<br/><br/>""GoodFellas"" is full of classic scenes and moments that you'll want to watch over and over again. ***Spoilers Following*** The restaurant-scene that introduces us to the grown-up Tommy for the first time...""How am I funny to you? Do I make you laugh, like a clown? Do I amuse you?"". Tommy's revenge when he gets embarrassed by Billy Batts, and the scenes where he's picking on Spider...""It was a good shot!"". ***End Of Spoilers*** These are only a few of them. If I'm going to complain about something in this film, then it's Lorraine Bracco in her role as Henry's wife Karen. Don't get me wrong, she's doing a good performance, but she doesn't convince me in EVERY scene she appears in. And when actors like Liotta, Pesci and De Niro gleams in their roles, she falls a little short in comparison.<br/><br/>The directing is one of the best things in this film. Martin Scorsese is an artist behind the camera, and he directs this film in a perfect way. It's so exciting to watch this film, and I really like the scenes where the camera smoothly flies through the restaurants, bars and so on. And with Henry and Karen's voice-overs on top of it, it's all perfection. And I'm not going to forget to mention the soundtrack. Numerous great songs from the 60's and the 70's plays in the background during the major part of the movie, and gives us the right feeling for the setting of the film.<br/><br/>I haven't seen ""Mean Streets"" (1973) yet, but if I'm going to pick out the best film by Martin Scorsese, then it would stand between this one and ""Taxi Driver"" (1976). It's hard to choose since it's two very different films. But both of them are classics, and films to be watched over and over again. ""GoodFellas"" is a masterpiece, and in the Gangster-genre it's only being topped by Italian director Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time In America"" (1984), in my opinion. If you haven't seen it, then you sure is missing out one of the best Gangster-flicks that you'll ever see. And if you've already seen it, see it one more time and you'll probably consider it just as good and entertaining as the last time you saw it!<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

However, I must disagree with LW when he says ""the editing has no consistency in parts"". Surely the film's editing is what elevates it above the norm into the great. The film is not a three hour patience tester. In fact it seems the perfect length, no over indulgence, just story telling. Three scenes spring to mind: the opening (f*#king awesome), Jimmy's cull to the sound of God (Clapton) and the cooking sequence near the drug bust.These scenes not only involve the viewer, they drag him into a film which is about, the most despicable characters ever created - and we love them. One more, the bar scene, when no editing is required it's not used (I know he tried it before in MS but not nearly as effectively). What can you say about the man?

Also enjoyed the wonderful acting by De Niro, who is amazing as Jimmy Conway (who ""roots for the bad guys in movies"") and Pesci, the loose cannon Tommy DeVito, among many others. The dialogue is awesome, with so many great lines that I know by heart, especially by the somewhat domesticated, somewhat wild Karen Hill, played by Lorraine Bracco (""You got some nerve standing me up. Who do you think you are, Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?""). I loved her approach to convince her husband she needs more money to go shopping. Loved, loved, loved the soundtrack, too. You can feel the different decades covered in this movie, between the clothes, the music, the hair. Obviously wonderful direction under Scorsese, Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies ever made!"

","Telling a great story means telling it vividly but without excess.  In a film this means the development of characters appropriate to importance, including the important details and not omitting the important details.  It means vibrant energy, without distraction caused by egotistical digression of writer, director or actor.<br/><br/>Goodfellas doesn't tell a story of epic merit, but it does tell a damned good story - and it tells it so appropriately well, that the audience is absorbed into a world that is surreal but engrossing and credible.<br/><br/>This film is a classic because it is doesn't fail any of the rules of fine movie construction - it exceeds them all.  The viewer is carried, even swept away with the poignant but tranquil first-person narration (similar to ""The Drug Store Cowboy"") in the sea of action, great moments, and big characters.<br/><br/>Certainly this is a a must-see for serious film lovers."

The one and only Al Pacino! If Al were to have starred in this movie it would still be the most popular movie ever. I only recently have witnessed the greatness of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro and wish that i had started witnessing (as it were) their great work a long time ago. Goodfellas is a great trial and error film, with plenty of risks and blood spillages (Joe Pecci getting shot in the head) (Joe Pecci shooting and stabbing a ""Made"" man in the back of his car) i would give this film ten out of ten, but.... i don't feel it deserves this rating. 8 out of 10 will do.

","I had to see this movie ever since I first heard about it. I never used to watch gangster films but this one is certainly the greatest as far as i'm concerned along with Godfather I and II and Scarface following very closely behind. The performances, writing, directing are all outstnading. No actor is slightly better or worse and they are all matched by each other. Liotta, De Niro and Pesci are a fantastic team and they really do make you feel what its like in the world of the mafia. Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorese's script is outstanding is certainly Oscar worthy. But the acadamey disagreed. At least they didn't look down on Pesci's brilliant supporting performance. De Niro could also have won it and should have been nominated. But in my opinion Liotta desreved Best Actor. He is basically taking us on a guide of his 30 years of his life in the mafia and you just cannot take your eyes or ears for that matter of it for one second. The narration is done so brilliantly that you'd think Liotta was actually a member of the mafia! Anyway this a fantastic film about the ups and down these three guys (goodfellas) have throughout their time in the mafia and it has to be seen by everyone at some point in there life!<br/><br/>A certain 10/10"

As Henry describes his upbringing, you can't help but feel for the plight of his neighbourhood...(as he says he makes more than most of the adults as a teenager). This film doesn't glorify the mob, but it does identify the characters as human beings, especially Henry Hill. Plus it has the added benefits of many actors that have since made great cast members of sopranos Lorraine Bracco, Tony Sirico, Frank Vincent, but to name a few(another classic mob drama, roll on season 6!!)

","Just how Martin Scorsese - arguably one of the most influential directors of modern cinema - has been overlooked for the Best Director Oscar after over thirty years of filmmaking is beyond me. Seminal films such as 'Taxi Driver' (1976) and 'Raging Bull' (1980) - both notorious, whether justified or not, for their visceral violence - have done more than enough to seal Scorsese's reputation as an acclaimed storyteller and 'Goodfellas' (1990) continues in this tradition. With an opening line of narrated dialogue that any scriptwriter would have loved to have committed to paper (Martin Scorsese co scripted the film), and one destined to be quoted for years to come, the film follows three decades in the life of Henry Hill, an Irish Sicilian who grows up truly under the influence and instruction of the 'family'. As with others of this genre, all the common themes of the Italian mob-scene are there: the loyalty, the respect, the violence, the eventual, some would say inevitable, downfalls and consequences of a life of crime, but ultimately where 'Goodfellas' differs and succeeds compared with the multitude of other Gangster films is its basis in truth - the life and times of a man as he graduates through the ranks and learns his trade. But one of the most important rules of the mafia is don't bite the hand that feeds, and as Henry finds out, a betrayal of Paulie, the man responsible for the life he leads, has disturbing and lasting effects. An aspect that really sets 'Goodfellas' apart is the portrayal of characters by a cast all on top form. Ray Liotta has never been better than as Henry, a Goodfella with a reasonable streak, and the ease at which Robert De Niro portrays the calculating Jimmy is frightening - its almost second nature. Joe Peschi, like De Niro a Scorsese favourite, acts as the heart of the film as the dynamic Tommy - a man all too willing to shoot and maim anyone who dares to cross him. Finally Paul Sorvino as Paulie offers gravitas to the film, with cold, dead eyes saying more than any amount of words. Much of the acting is tough yet realistic, with one standout scene involving Peschi telling Liotta a story in a restaurant. Folklore would have us believe that a majority of the scene is improvised making the unpredictable nature of the film clear and chilling. When speaking of style, 'Goodfellas' has it in abundance and pivotal to this individualistic style is the use of narration. Placed firmly by Henry's side throughout, the actions he takes become almost acceptable - a criticism often levelled at this type of film. A feeling of 'Sympathy For The Devil' if you will. Scorsese's masterful use of kinetic camerawork in the latter stages of the film also does well to reflect the cocaine-fuelled state of mind of our protagonist. One can never be sure of the authenticity of films based on true events but 'Goodfellas' seems at the very least better than most.. A modern classic you'll be reaching for again and again."

"gregsrants","10","0","0","11 March 2004"," The Best film of the 1990's
","I hate it when people ask me what my favorite movie of all time is.  That is like asking an art lover what their favorite painting is.  Break it down to favorite abstract painter, favorite contemporary artist, and you might get a more definitive answer.  So asking a movie buff what their favorite film is not entirely fair.  I have a favorite comedy, a favorite drama, horror, foreign film etc., but to pick one from the bunch is more question than I can handle.<br/><br/>Given my above conundrum, if I was ever to amass a list of best-evers, 1990's Goodfellas would surely be near the top of the list.  Directed by Martin Scorsese and featuring an all-star cast including Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta, Goodfellas was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture.  Although at the end of the March ceremony, only one award was engraved with a participant's name - Pesci for Supporting Actor - Goodfellas remains as maybe the best film of the 1990's.<br/><br/>
Based on the novel 'Wiseguy', by Nicholas Pileggi, the movie follows the true story of Henry Hill (Liotta), as he rises through the ranks of the mob. From child to young adult, we watch Henry as he gains acceptance, gets married, and goes to jail, starts dealing drugs, all leading to his capture by authorities.<br/><br/>Along for the wild ride of mob hits, heists and murders are Jimmy and Tommy (DeNiro and Pesci, respectively), two lifetime mobsters that take Henry under their wings and teach him the ropes.  Jimmy is the elder statesman who handles things professionally and is respected for his calm demeanor. Tommy is the hot-head stereotype who resorts to violence whenever threatened. Together, they provide the perfect balance for Henry as he tries to cope with life in the underworld while maintaining a normal life presence.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is a near perfect film.  Scorsese has cast each part with actors born to play their role.  From Paul Sorvino as the mob figurehead to Lorraine Bracco in a breakthrough performance as Henry's love interest, the cast fits together like a leather glove.  And they each have cool names to boot.  There is Spider, Fat Andy, Pete the Killer and Jimmy Two Times just to ramble off a few.  Whether you were a bit player or someone with a bigger trailer, Scorsese handles everyone with crafted dialogue and incredible attention to authenticity.<br/><br/>What also makes Goodfellas so good, are the costumes and set design that bring us right back to the 70's and 80's tacky kitchens and pastel living room furniture.  Scorsese does well in bringing us through multiple decades and showing the natural progression of the actors and their belongings as time marches forward.<br/><br/>Even the voice over works.  Not a fan of this cheap tactic to move a story forward, Henry Hill bursts narration throughout the film with quotes like, `Jimmy was the kinda guy that rooted for bad guys in the movies' and `Whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport. To us, it was better than Citibank.'  Each narration brings either humor or does well in helping us grow with the characters and eventually cheering for violence bearing mafia.<br/><br/>But if I could pick one thing to give the director his chops, it would have to be in his depiction of Henry Hill.  By taking his time with the story (the movie does run 145 minutes), we can follow Henry through the many stages of his involvement.  When Henry is involved with his first encounter with violence, it is a believable occurrence based on the progression. And when Henry begins selling drugs, we may not agree, but we can definitely understand what brought him and his family to that stage of their lives.<br/><br/>The DVD comes without many special features, and that is too bad.  It would be interesting to hear Scorsese talk about how some cast members (Michael Imperioli and Tony Sirico) went on to become famous with the Soprano's, or how he was able to nab Samuel L. Jackson and Vincent Gallo for parts all but forgotten by the audience before the end credits.<br/><br/>Five stars are not to be taken or given lightly.  Goodfellas deserves every one of them."

Robert Deniro who shares the title of mob movie king with Al Pacino was no less than perfect. And Ray Liotta played a part which I don't believe anybody else could have played. Not to mention Joe Pesci playing the crazy yet funny S.O.B. Where as a lot of mob movies are long and can sometimes be a little boring, Goodfellas keeps you interested the whole time. This was truly a Martin Scorsese masterpiece and believe me when I say that if i ever met him I would say that to him. and I must say that Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite flicks."

","If there's one thing Goodfellas it criticsed for, its the lack of definite storyline, since it follows more of a documentary style of gangster life than it does a plot. Yet each scene is so engaging, so beautifully acted and includes such top-knotch script writing that you will forget that aspect and become drawn into individually sections. Because, after all, this film aimed to depict the mafia lifestyle, it was never an action or thriller-based story. The random violence that occurs and brilliant narration throughout only serve to further enhance the entire image the film gets across. The character relationships are also cleverly forged together, and the unpredictable nature of the film allows you to hinge nicely throughout and keeps you in suspense. Perhaps this film is not for everyone, if you like a proper storyline you may be disappointed, but this film is pure genius since it followed- and achieved what it set out to do- shock and exploit the very innards of gangster life. Now become the don and watch it :D"

I watched Goodfellas years before I watched The Godfather series but when I watched The Godfather part one, I was amazed by how well this movie was made. I mean for anyone who thinks that Goodfellas is better than The Godfather, if you watch the two movies carefully, you'll find a scene in The Godfather part one when James Cann(Sonny) gets a call from his sister Talia Shire(Connie) and finds out that her husband hit her badly again, so he goes to her but he get whacked in the way over, the same scene repeats itself in Goddfellas when Lorraine Bracco (Karen) calls Ray Liotta(Henry) and the same thing happens again except that this time Ray doesn't get whacked in his way over to beat the sh*t out of Karen's neighbor friend. It is wrong comparing any movie with the Godfather and vice versa but still it is good that Martin Scorsese was able to make a movie that was and still a movie that I like to watch from time to time and keep in mind that no one is able to make movies like this anymore, not even Martin Scorsese himself."

","Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' focuses on three main characters: Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), and Tommy Devito (Joe Pesci in his Oscar- winning performance). The film chronicles thirty years of life in the mob, starting with Henry Hill as a teenager and ending with him as a full grown adult. The supporting cast includes Karen Hill (Oscar- nominated Lorraine Bracco), and Mob Boss Paul Ciccero (Paul Sorvino). The film got a total of six Oscar Nominations, including Best Director and Best Picture. This is perhaps Martin Scorsese's most (in)famous film, and it's definitely one of his best. Using narration and at times freeze- frame editing, he tells the story of the three main characters (mainly Hill) with great power. The characters feel realistic, as do the settings and the viewer feels like he/ she's there with the people in the film. The screen- play, based on the novel Wiseguys by Nicholas Pileggi, takes it's time to show the way the Mob lives. Each detail is studied carefully, and as mentioned above the characters feel real.

If you liked this movie, you should check out King of New York, The Godfather, Once Upon a Time in America, and Empire."

","Martin Scorsese is America's greatest director and this is his greatest movie. It's detractors claim that it glamourises violence, it's cold hearted, and that it's cartoonish, all of which are baseless. The ending is far from a glamorous outcome for Ray Liotta's Henry Hill, while there is real warmth in many scenes, particularly the one in which Joe Pesci visits his mother (played by Catherine Scorsese, Marty's mother). And if it is cartoonish, at least it's more enjoyable than the comparitively sombre Casino. Liotta is the centre of this movie and his performance is justly towering. Joe Pesci is also memorable as Tommy, the most psychotic gangster ever. De Niro isn't as good here as in his other Scorsese collaborations but he's still silently menacing. Technically, tracking shots, cutting, freeze frames and a rock/pop score are brilliantly used to create a vibrant depiction of the gangster lifestyle. Goodfellas never looses it's grip, not even on repeat viewings. Deserves to be made compulsory viewing."

","This movie is based on the book Wiseguy. The book was based on a true story, so ofcourse the movie is too. The film is about three friends who become criminals. Robert DeNiro is one hell of an actor. He plays the friendly, but tough criminal: Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway. This role was probably pretty damn tough. Then there's Ray Liotta who plays Henry Hill. Henry Hill is a cocaine sniffing young criminal. Joe Pesci is funny (as he showed in My Cousin Vinny). He still has a little bit of comedy in this movie. He plays the maniac, Tommy DeVito. That role earned him an Academy Award. Lorraine Bracco plays Karen Hill (Henry's wife). Bracco has a tough role playing Hill's wife. Then last, but not least. There's Paul Sorvino. He plays the mob boss: Paul Cicero. Or in the movie: Paulie. All these great actors, but what about the director? Well the director is Martin Soresce. We know Soresce directing films like: Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Gangs of New York. Overall, this movie is absolutley brilliant! Watch it people! A 10 out of 10!"
"departed07","10","0","0","20 July 2003"," The Gangster Film To Beat
","""As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.""<br/><br/>I remember reading Roger Ebert's review of ""Gangs of New York"" and though his review of the film was biased, he mentions how GoodFellas was a classic in point of direction and of characters. As I recall, people have mention that ""The Godfather"" is the best crime film ever made, but I disagree; ""The Godfather"" was a film that showed the consequences of people in organize crime or in a organization, but not GoodFellas. GoodFellas shows the exciting sides of people in the mafia, where they would go to bars, dinners, and laugh at America and those who were inferior to them.<br/><br/>GoodFellas is a story about a young Irishman name Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta as the older version) who every night sees the mobsters hanging on the other side of the street where he sees them park their cars in the middle of the streets, play cards and play their music all night without anybody complaining. The leader of the mafia is Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) who is reclusive towards the neighborhood, sure people have heard of him, but he doesn't like people watching him and yet Henry himself lies to his parents when he decides to work for Paul and his mafia and is finally notice in the neighborhood, though his father doesn't approve, his dad beats Henry a couple of times. But does that stop him? No.<br/><br/>Years later, Henry grows up (Ray Liotta now) and is enjoying what he is actually doing. He steals and kills like the rest of the gangsters in order to make ends meat instead of working nine-to-five jobs for stupid paychecks.<br/><br/>During the film we encounter a group of characters in the film that not only work for Henry, but also change the face in cinema history. Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway (Robert De Niro) is the rebel that cheers for the bad guys in the movie and has been in jail when he was twelve for stealing. In the film, Henry narrates that Jimmy ""enjoys"" stealing and throughout the film, De Niro does make his presence where if you see his face, show him some respect. Another character in the film is Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) whose reputation is more than being in the mafia, but actually has a wild temper when somebody makes him mad. In one scene at a party, Tommy is embarrassed by the fact that the owner of the restaurant wants him to pay the tab of $7,000, and yet beats the hell out of the waiter proving that you can't mess with a crew of the mafia, no matter what the rank is.<br/><br/>There's another character in the story that is also a narrator, and the character is Karen (Lorraine Bracco), who was pressure to go out with Henry on a double date so that way Tommy can bang the girl of his dreams. In one scene she is stood up by Henry and tells Tommy to go after her and after embarrassing Henry in front of the mafia on the streets, Karen goes out with Henry on a single date where she doesn't what he does. Later during the film, she finds out that he's in the mob and fears that she will lose him.<br/><br/>A lot of things happen during the film; a made man is killed, Henry cheats on his wife and goes to jail, a money heist takes place, half of Jimmy's mafia gets whacked and a supporting character gets killed.<br/><br/>With a great soundtrack and a great storyline, GoodFellas proves that cheering for the bad guys is a good thing after all."

"lydiae67","10","0","0","11 July 2003"," THE BEST GANGSTER FILM OF THE 90'S
","There is no doubt that Goodfellas is a true gangster classic which represents high points in the careers of those involved in it. Scorsese tells the true story of Henry Hill and his cohorts superbly, starting as he means to go on - with a violent, profanity ladened fast paced tale of Hill's rise to prominence in New York's organised crime underworld during the sixties and seventies and his subsequent rapid demise as he goes from airport heists to drug dealing and finally ends up in the witness protection scheme where he remains to this day.<br/><br/>As Scorsese takes us on this twenty five year journey we are introduced to and get to know the various wiseguys that Hill associates with, from those at the very top like Paulie Cicero to people like Morrie (Chuck Low) and brief introductions to Jimmy ""Two Times"" and Fat Andy etc. And then there is Tommy De Vito. Let's make no mistake about it, this is Pesci's finest performance which rightly won him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Unlike Casino in which he basically plays the same character but with a different name, in Goodfellas Pesci is far more believable as a guy who will kill people without thinking twice but despite this, he doesn't make the audience dislike him, he is a far more rounded character and despite all his violence, and after all the fast talking and wisecracks you can't help but like him and find him amusing.<br/><br/>Pesci is the one with most of the best lines in the film, the most famous of which is the Funny How? scene which legend has it was written and directed by Pesci at the request of Scorsese. It is a scene that demonstrates both sides of Tommy's character perfectly and which couldn't have been bettered in any way. It's definitely one of my favourite movie moments.<br/><br/>Pesci's undoubtably steals the show in Goodfellas but every single character in the film is played to perfection. Liotta, despite not going on to bigger and better things after Goodfellas, is convincing as Henry and De Niro despite not having as much screen time as one might expect in such a film plays the charismatic but also ""violent when necessary"" Jimmy Conway, who holds a lot of sway within the organisation and is the orchestrator of most of the heists. Others of note include : Lorraine Bracco, Frank Vincent, Paul Sorvino and Catherine Scorsese who plays Tommy's mother, all of whom fit their respective roles in the film perfectly.<br/><br/>**** out of 4"
"directjw","10","0","0","26 June 2003"," Scorsese's Masterpiece
","Martin Scorsese is the greatest living American director, and Goodfellas is clearly his masterpiece.  The reason why is because it is essentially a culmination of all the themes and filmic styles he was working with prior to Goodfellas.  What makes Goodfellas stands out is the passion which Scorsese displays in every scene.  Unlike Casino and Gangs of New York, which were also great movies, Goodfellas has a sense of enjoyment and liveliness amidst all the carnage.<br/><br/>After Goodfellas, Scorsese made plenty of great movies, but nothing he has done since, and prior to Goodfellas, reaches the pinnacle of this miraculous piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Long live Scorsese!"

","Scorcese's Goodfellas is a well-crafted device into the very core of a gangster.  OK putting the fact that it's based on a true story aside, we're also allowed into and become involved in every twist, turn, hope and desire in the life of Henry Hill.  Liotta is fantastic as the guy who just 'slipped' into the life of an out and out gangster.  My only gripe about the portrayal of this character is that we may have been led to feel a bit more sympathetically towards him then perhaps we should have.<br/><br/>I think this is probably Pesci's monumental role.  That scene where he pulls Liotta's leg is at one moment sickeningly scary and at the next screamingly funny.<br/><br/>I think what strikes me most about this film is the fragility of any real friendship/relationship structure in this portrayal of the mob.

Add to that a great script,great dialogues and beautiful music and you get an all-time classic.The first scene of the movie shows that it won't be always easy to watch,but the violence is never over the top in this movie,although it is often gruesome.But then,Goodfellas isn't a movie about a tea party! The way that Scorsese mixes the scenes with period music is absolutely brilliant.He did it in Mean Streets and would do it again in his other Gangster Classic:Casino. Just look and listen when the scene comes up in which De Niro and Pesci brutally kick and punch a Maffia hood almost to his death.The song Atlantis by Donovan makes the scene even better and gives it an extra dimension.<br/><br/>The story is well-known so I won't tell that,although it is very well put together and has no loose ends. Joe Pesci plays like never before,he only reached this same divine level in Casino and De Niro is brilliant as always.Ray Liotta is also very good here and it is a shame that he never surpassed or even reached the same level ever again.<br/><br/>Although I think that the follow up,Casino,is an even better picture Goodfellas remains an all-time classic and it is a shame that it never won the Oscar(Best Picture or Best Director!!).

","Undoubtedly, Goodfella's is an exceptional film that portrays life in a notorious gang, with no holds barred.  The cast is simply electric, as Ray Liotta delivers a wonderfully colourful and emotional performance as the boy striving to be a someone in a land of 'losers'.  The film focuses on Liotta's ambition to be part of something extraordinary, something that will give him an identity above anyone else.  Robert de Niro eventually becomes an overseer of Liotta's and together with Joe Pesci, who's depiction of Tommy Devito - a brutal gang member who always acts before he thinks - become embroiled in heists of an undercover nature.  The pace of the movie is exquisite, as issues of ambition and loyalty ensure Liotta's (Henry Hill) excitement of the way the other half live is kept to optimum.  Love is also on the horizon, but a Mobsters world is never a straight die as drugs cloud judgement and errors test friendships.  Simply fantastic."

If anyone ever thought they would like to be in the Mafia,I'm sure this would deter them. Scorcese shows the degeneration of Henry Hill (Liotta) from fresh faced kid to paranoid coke addict. All the people he admired either died or went to prison and in the end he is utterly alone. There is no honour among thieves seems to be what the movie is saying. Forget the notion of glamourous, honourable mafiosi, looking out for each other.

","Martin Scorsese drew up a foreshadow of this film within ""Raging Bull.""  He foreshadowed mafia like characters and also the trifecta in himself, DeNiro, and Pesci (Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino).  <br/><br/>Why compare Goodfellas to The Godfather?  Two totally different scenarios, directors, and group of actors.  Criticism should be placed with a more centered commonality (director, screenplay writer) instead of such a gereral film genre as ""dramatic crime/mafia"".  It makes more for the comparison than the pushing away of cinema because it's not something that you've already seen (gosh forbid if movies are suppose to be original in some context!). <br/><br/>
Goodfellas is simply ingenious.  The cinematography is phenomenal and Scorsese is a master of the voice over narration.  He's a guru of the timing of still frames and gives more value to such dark lighting.  The list of actors can't be denied in its own fame and with such deep characters to portray.  A storyline that keeps you interested makes for less of a drag. And the music defines the time era which helps to make characters/events even more indulging.<br/><br/>Scorsese is a man of all films.

","As 'The Seven Samurai' was for Kurosawa, this is the film that Scorsese will always be remembered for. And like that Kurosawa opus, it is not because of technical perfection or creative peak, but because this movie struck the perfect balance of the two. Kurosawa and Scorsese both had other films that were more creative (Roshomon and Taxi Driver, respectively), and they both had other films that were more technically impressive (Ran and Kwaidan, respectively), but it is in those two films that the two directors found the balance that makes a masterpiece. Kurosawa never again achieved that balance (although he came close a few times), and Scorsese has yet to as well (although he has also come close).<br/><br/>this film just pops! it has a frenetic energy that makes its nearly two and a half hour running time just fly by. the various details, and the charismatic narration (possibly the finest use of narration in film to date) used to point them out just draws you into this world. scorsese's use of abrupt freezeframes during the exposition stage really punctuates the points of those scenes. by this time scorsese had already perfected his use of music in such films as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver, but here it shines like no other. he actually scores the entire film with period pop tunes, picked with exquiste taste, variety and precision. all though so many films have tried, no other movie uses music quite like this, and quite this well (well, maybe Boogie Nights).<br/><br/>The cast is a who's-who of actors who have done, or would go on to do fine work in the mafia genre. Sopranos fans will no doubt notice a young Micheal Imperioli (Christopher) playing the bartender 'Spider' in a memerable scene. I recall in an episode of the Sopranos in which Cristopher, having been made to wait for an inordinately long time at a bakery, get fed up and shoots the counter-person in the foot. the guy, writhing on the ground in pain, asks ""why did you have to shoot me in the foot?!"", and in a clever nod to his Goodfellas role, Christopher responds ""it happens"".<br/><br/>ahh, I could go on forever about this movie. just see it (whether or not you've seen it already)."

","This film is without a doubt the best DeNiro/Scorsese collabaration.  In fact, the only other Scorsese film that comes close to it is Taxi Driver. The story is all about Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta) life as a gangster in New York.  Robert Deniro, Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco all have wonderful supporting roles, as does Joe Pesci, whose excellent performance as the psychotic Tommy DeVito won him a well deserved oscar. There's no prizes for guessing that DeNiro does his job well, as does The talented Sorvino.  But it may come as a shock that Ray Liotta also plays his part very well, as does Lorraine Bracco.  There is also a small role for a pre Pulp Fiction Samuel L. Jackson, and one of my favourite character actors, Beau Starr (Halloween 4 and 5, Speed) also pops up in a role as Henry's father.<br/><br/>Scorsese's direction, as always, is flawless, with interesting camera shots, and a celebrated steadycam shot through the bowels of a night club.  The music used is perfect for the film, with hits from the 50's right up to the 80's.<br/><br/>The violence in the film is graphic and frequent, however, it all adds to the film, and is intended to make you scared and possibly discusted and horrified.  You will walk away from this film with possibly the same sort of feeling you had when you'd just seen A Clockwork Orange, or Reservoir Dogs. But be aware of this;  the most talked about scene in A Clockwork Orange is the 'Singing In The Rain rape scene' in Reservoir Dogs, it's the 'ear slicing scene'.  In Goodfellas it's the '""How am I funny?"" scene'.  That shows to me that the acting in Goodfellas is so good, that it far outweighs the violence and death, even though, realistically, that is was the film's about.<br/><br/>This is a film that everyone with even the slightest interest in film should see, if you only ever see one Scorsese film, make it this.  10 out of 10."
"Pedro_H","10","0","0","12 October 2002"," Martin Scorsese's Greatest Hit
","The life story of gangster from childhood to present day.<br/><br/>The reason classic movies are so few and far between is that there is too much to go wrong. It is, after all, the most combined of the arts. But boy when the script, acting, music and direction come right you have the greatest art form in the world. I have sat and thought how I cannot give this movie 10 out of 10 - but I cannot find one, so 10 it is.<br/><br/>(I had to break a my vow never to give a 10 to do this. After all how many things are perfect?  But it is a step better than my 9 movies, so what can I do?)<br/><br/>It is ironic that Liotta - the central figure (Henry Hill) - in this drama is the least impressive and a class below both Pesci (he will never get a role as good as this) and De Niro (under acting here for once). Whether this is deliberate (so as to make it look less sexy?) I don't know. The Liotta movies that have followed have done nothing to to change my mind - although the role suits him right down to the ground so he is not doing any damage.<br/><br/>(Can the guy play people of authority? Teachers, lawyers, government officials? In other words, people WITHOUT a screw loose?)<br/><br/>De Niro doesn't have to do much in gangster roles. He is introduced - in voice over - as 28 and despite the fact that he is clearly in his 40's we don't care. His Jimmy ""the Gent"" Conway is a slimeball crime figure, not that bright, but brighter than those around. What do they say: In the world of the blind the one-eyed man is king?<br/><br/>Conway has worked out that it is easier to kill people than pay them the money he owes. He cannot knock the writer (Nicholas Pileggi) for this because it happens to be true. I could live without this fact being set to pop music though.<br/><br/>Pesci won an Oscar for his Tommy Devito. This is the most amazing performance in the history of cinema: Deadly and funny at the same time. A complete acting master class and we are going to be seeing versions of this in movies forever. This role is to him what  the Zorba The Greek was to Anthony Quinn: To good to be played only once!<br/><br/>The hyprocracy, stupidity, the viciousness, the black humour are all well done. Who else but director Scorsese would dare start with a scene that involves such callous violence? People that don't like this scene should stick to Disney movies, this is violence that is real and is based on a real incident. If some viewers prefer plastic violence, so what?<br/><br/>
This might be the best piece of work that Martin Scorsese ever brings to the screen. Some comedians call it ""Martin Scorsese's Greatest Hits"". I call it Martin Scorsese's most perfectly realised picture.<br/><br/>Oh there is one thing I don't like about it - the trailer is terrible and sells the picture as being pro violence."

","When encouraging people, who have yet to view this masterpiece, to get down the video shop and hire this wonderful film, I describe the opening scene. (*spoiler*) Three guys are in a car, at night. One of them hears a noise, so they pull over. One takes out a gun, another draws a knife. The boot of the car is opened to reveal a beaten up guy in distress. The knife armed fella proceeds to repeatedly stab the victim. Then the guy with the gun shoots him several times. It was this opening scene that instantly drew me in to this film, and developed my love for gangster movies. The only film to shock me in it's opening sequence the same way since then is Saving Private Ryan. A rare attribute in a movie indeed. So what about the rest of the 2+ hours of this movie? The casting is perfect. Old hands to Scorsese films, De Niro and Pesci must have been obvious choices. Pesci especially as the frightening Tommy. He even admitted in an interview that he scared himself at times. Ray Liotta has the performance of his lifetime, unfortunately it looks like he will never have the opportunity to top it. And Paul Sorvino proves the point that saying nothing can speak volumes in his role as mafia boss Paulie. The film covers three decades of the characters lives in the mafia and the music, costumes and settings help carry you through the years believably without trying to shove the time period in your face. The true magic of this film is that you are drawn into the characters lives, despite knowing that they are the sort of people that you would normally despise. This is done through the fast paced storyline and dialogue. You are continually shocked by the characters actions because, at the end of the day, life in the mafia is a life with friends who will shake your hand one day, and shoot you in the back the next. If you haven't seen this film yet, stop what your doing get down the rental shop, and 'make that coffee to go!'"

","Possible Spoilers.<br/><br/>It appears that Scorsese loves to film gangster movies, not only that, he loves to base his movies on character studies.<br/><br/>This movie without Scorsese would had been great. Since we have great acting from Ray and Joe, (Joe was especially good but he did the exact same thing in Casino). Bobby in this film was up to his normal standard but it was obvious he didn't want to steal the show.<br/><br/>However, the main key to the success of this movie is about the method that the story is presented. The way Scorsese told this story was speical. It can even be compared to the great camera works from Citizen Kane. There are so many different things to look out for in the movie, you have to see it twice or more. The first time you will just stick to the plot. The second time you have to look for all the camera angles! I am no movie critic, but there was that scene when Ray and Robert talking in coffe shop. The scene was filmed so that the foreground main character stays the same while the background (outside of window) gradually gets larger. And later near the end of the movie, Ray attempts to pull a ""Woody"" stunt by talking straight to the camera. <br/><br/>This movie really can't be watched as if it is a normal film like spiderman or star wars...it must be watched in the light of other greats like Taxi Driver and Raging Bull."
"chrisow","Null","0","0","9 July 2002"," What more can be said?
","====Possible Spoilers=== What could have been ''...just another gangster film...'' has become one of the truly great modern classics of our time. It seems every decade, Martin Scorsese makes a classic ( 70's = Taxi Driver, 80's = Raging Bull and 90's GoodFellas)<br/><br/>    The rise and fall of Henry Hill, half - Italian and half - Irish, would always make captivating viewing, since it focuses on the lower parts of the mob: the people who go out and do the dirty work. Pop music from 50's, 60's and 70's are all included to evoke the feel of the era. Songs such as: Rags to Riches = Tony Bennet, Sunshine of Your Love = Cream, Layla (Piano Exit) Derek and The Dominos and My Way = Sid Vicious.<br/><br/>    The camerawork and dialogue also make this stand out. Mob movies (at that point) were content with pointing cameras at actors. While there is nothing wrong with that, GoodFellas makes full use of it's cameras. There's tracking shots, zooms, freeze frames and misplaced frames, such as the last scene: a suburbanised Henry, in his dressing gown, picks up the morning paper. At that point, Joe Pesci's character, Tommy, points his gun at the camera and starts firing. There is no fat in the story and it moves at a quick pace. <br/><br/>    The movie gives us memorable, quotable and pop culture referenced dialogue before Tarantino. It draws us into the world of Henry and shows us how a simple remark results in violence. <br/><br/>    Acting wise, nobody puts a foot wrong. Ray Liotta shows us why he's the most underrated actor working in America today. Robert De Niro is, surprisingly, understated and unflashy in his role as Jimmy Conway. Joe Pesci carefully balances the violence and humour in an Oscar winning role. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is flawless.<br/><br/>    The real plaudits go to Martin Scorsese. He's produced a masterpiece that perfectly counterbalances The Godfather. <br/><br/>    Well done to all concerned."

The saddest part is when Tommy is really excited about getting in to the exclusive, 100% Italian mafia, and then ends up getting killed.  I really feel Jimmy's pain when he mourns the loss of his friend.  Even though they're really bad people, they still have feelings for their friends. <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese does a great job directing this mafia masterpiece.

","Martin Scorsese delivers yet another fine example of film making at its best. Goodfellas has all the elements of a great film: an entertaining script, a talented cast and effective use of cinematic devices such as still photography and voice-over narration. One of the highlights of Goodfellas is the dialogue, with well-written narration (""How could I go back to school and pledge allegance to the flag and sit through good government bullshit?"") and rapid-fire conversations. The soundtrack is the finishing touch: it creates a ""gangsta"" tone and makes the whole thing more authentic.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is arguably the best mob movie. I believe that it surpasses Coppola's The Godfather because it is more entertaining, better written and much of the acting (with the exception of Brando) surpasses performances in The Godfather.

Instead of being a standard, point-A to point-B kinda movie, Goodfellas really gives you the sense that you're watching someone's life unfold.  Just like in real life, characters move in and out of Henry's life, appearing and disappearing from view at random points in time.  We are treated to some ""precious moments"" that might not help advance the very loose plot, but give us glimpses in Henry's life.  For example, the long steadicam shot as Henry walks his future wife Karen into the Copacabana, the famous ""funny"" sequence, and the scene where Tommy's mother cooks the guy's dinner while they have a body in the trunk really give you a sense that these are REAL people, not the stereotypes in fedoras and slick suits that you often see in gangster pictures.

It's the story of Henry Hill, from the day he decided he wanted to be a gangster until the day he joined the Witness Protection Program. <br/><br/>  All along the movie, he sticks with crazy Tommy De Vito (Pesci) and living-mob-legend, Jimmy Conway (De Niro) as they work for Paulie (Paul Sorvino).  All goes well for Henry until he starts cheating on his wife and then gets sent to jail.  The scenes in the jail where you see where wiseguys live apart from the rest of the prisoners are excellent (especially when Henry describes diner in jail).<br/><br/>  As good as Liotta, Bracco , De Niro, and Sorvino are though, it's Joe Pesci who rules this movie.  His incarnation of the crazy, cowboy-like, short-tempered Tommy De Vito, he is excellent and it's understandable that he won the Oscar for best supporting-actor (he also supplies a lot of the laughs).  Don't miss this one.  It's definitely one of Scorsese's best."

","It is not often that I am lost for words after watching a film, indeed normally it is the infernal rage within me that makes me want to scream, notably after seeing Batman and Robin. However the first time that I saw Goodfellas, about 6 years ago, it as good as changed the way I look at movies. I was dumbfounded by the sheer speed of the action and the dialogue. The performances were almost faultless (how Dances with Wolves won the oscars I will never understand) and the most impressive thing that stuck with me was the soundtrack. The way that Scorsese used certain music to convey emotion was to an extent that I had not seen before. Indeed the growing paranoia encompassed by Robert De Niro toward the end of the film, is expressed effortlessly when the camera pans towards him in the bar and the guitars from Cream's ""sunshine of your love,"" come into effect, this gives me the shivers every time I see it. OK there have been films with better cinematography (the Deerhunter par example) however this still remains the film that has had the most influence on my life, especially with the rest of the trash that we have had to put up with this decade."

","Every line is memorable as the next, as snappy as the last, Goodfellas brings a treat to fans of almost every genre. Joe Pesci(Home Alone) is the real star alongside Robert De Niro(Ronin) and Ray Liotta(who frankly lets the movie down). Martin Scorcesse directs an almost perfect movie and a landmark in filming history. The story centers around Ray Liotta and his entrance into the life of a wise guy. From a young man picking up employer's cars to a fully blown gangster. Him and his wife, Karen(Lorraine Bracco) start the marriage well;life couldn't be better, but before long they're addicted to drugs and on the run from cops. Some up and coming actors used the movie as a stepping stone into a successful star. You might remember a younger Samuel L Jackson in a very short-but welcome-part. In summary, the film is well cast, scripted successfully, and brilliantly acted out. Rating=5/5"

","Upon the first viewing of Goodfellas, one has to be struck by its fast-paced and entertaining nature.  This is a rare kind of movie that makes you feel as though you are part of the action, and it doesn't do this through incredible special effects.  Rather, Goodfellas wraps you in because of superb acting and filming, a captivating screenplay, and an engaging soundtrack- all the elements of a great movie.<br/><br/>There is no denying this is one of the best films of this decade. However, I do not think  this movie is flawless, as many on this website believe. While the first hour of the movie is entertaining, the second half gets bogged down with overly extended scenes- in particular the one where Henry Hill thinks he is being followed.  The movie loses the punch that it had in the beginning.  It's as though Scorsese got sick and tired of making the movie and he decided to speed up the process a bit, and this results in the last hour of the movie being a bit cumbersome.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Goodfellas is a fine move that is worth seeing for anyone interested in entertaining films."

To the point where any picture you see with DeNiro,Pesci,or Liotta you look for GoodFellas in it. DeNiro can play anybody or any thing. Pesci can't! No matter how hard he tries to do something different. Jimmy Hollywood,With Honors-Yeah right! Don't work that way,Joe! It's a no-win situation!   He does something different-he's unconvincing.He plays something similar to Tommy DeVito in GoodFellas-it will be obvious and no where near as good. It's almost like he used up all the good one-liners in GoodFellas. Liotta can try to to something different,but he'll always be remembered as Henry Hill. There were a lot of GoodFellas/Scorcese wannabes after GoodFellas was made. Like Quentin Tarantino(who I can't stand). GoodFellas was great!

"DanB-4","Null","0","0","2 July 1999"," The Best Film of the 90's
","Well, it's between Goodfellas, Schindler's List and Fargo for the best of the 90's, but IMHO, this is it. This movie stays with you and effects you in ways that few if any films do. Every scene is perfect, every shot works - it is brilliantly written and is another master work of editing by Thelma Schoonmaker. Its loss of the Best Picture Oscar to Dances with Wolves (of all movies) is the 2nd greatest scandal in Oscar History (next to the shutout of The Color Purple).<br/><br/>It is its attention to detail and Scorsese's ability to pick the exact, singularly perfect song for each shot that makes this film so great. Take the scene for example, of Robert DeNiro, sitting at the bar, silent, smoking a cigarette, essentially contemplating who to kill. As the shot slowly zooms in on him, I defy anyone to find better music than ""Sunshine of Your Love' to complete that gripping scene. Or even more so, the playing of Sid Vicious' slaughtering of ""My Way"" over the closing credits.<br/><br/>Pesci, Liotta, Deniro, Bracco and Sorvino (in the best role of his career) are stunning, but this is Martin Scorsese's triumph. He will be viewed upon one day (likely after his death) as the greatest ever American Director. He has four absolute masterpieces to his name, and not a single bad film. This, however, is the apex of his career.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is not about anything other than life in a crew - being on the inside. The guilt, the pride, the easy life, the paranoia, the forced laughter, the constant fear and the struggle to lie correctly when asked a tough question. In the famous scene with Paulie (Sorvino) asking Henry (Liotta) about the killing of a made guy from another crew, I have always believed that Paulie knows the truth and wants Henry to lie, but has to ask the question because it is expected of him. Not a direct question, just ""Whaddya know about that thing?"".<br/><br/>Goodfellas is a gift to moviegoers - one that should be enjoyed over and over again. It is violent and it does have more f-shots than any movie I can recall. It is edgy and uneasy and it will get right under your skin and make it crawl. But it is also infectious and addictive at the same time. The Canadian Cable Channel Bravo often plays this uncut and commercial free late at night and I find myself awake at 4 am watching it, even though I own the video.<br/><br/>The closing scene of this movie is probably the greatest sustained piece of filmmaking I have ever scene - Henry must sell some guns, close a drug deal, cook some pasta sauce, juggle his wife and girlfriend and outrun some pesky helicopters all in a fit of increasing paranoia. As the world closes in on Henry, it closes in on you and you want to squirm out. You know why Henry made his final decision.<br/><br/>Absolutely perfect. **** out of ****."
"EW-3","Null","0","0","1 July 1999"," The most realistic gangster movie ever made
","Goodfellas is the first and last word in gangster films, and except for Casino - also, fittingly enough, a Martin Scorcese film starring Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci - it's hard to imagine another crime movie ever having quite the same impact. When it comes to films of this type, Scorcese is one of the most brilliant directors ever, and it's largely due to the fact that he very obviously allows his actors simply to act, and to ""become"" the role that they are trying to portray. His convincing, no-nonsense, honest presentation of life in and around the mob has been imitated but never duplicated, and reflects a clear awareness on his part of the unwritten rules and principles of day-to-day urban interaction that go along with the business of crime.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of an unpredictable, out-of-control, and psychopathic mobster, a performance in which he quite literally scared the s**t out of movie audiences around the country. And if the award didn't go to him, it should have gone to Paul Sorvino, for his equally convincing performance as the impassive, experienced capo who was a master of the street life, and had the upper hand on nearly everyone and everything around him. Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, and (for a single but unforgettable scene) Frank Vincent also did outstanding work.<br/><br/>De Niro was in great form as well, although his performance becomes a little disappointing if you read Nicholas Pileggi's ""Wiseguy"", where you learn that the character he portrayed was in real life a much scarier guy - even tougher than the Pesci character. I wonder at times if Beau Starr, who played Henry Hill's hot-tempered and violent father, would have been more effective in that role.<br/><br/>The film doesn't really tell a story. Instead, like Raging Bull and Casino, it essentially has the effect of a documentary. It's not a perfect movie - it starts to drag at certain points about 3/4ths of the way through - but this can be overlooked. It's heavy use of foul language is par for the course - does anyone out there actually think gangsters use proper English or speak without swearing?<br/><br/>One other aspect of this film that I've never heard anyone mention is that it makes a very strong case for the ""Crime Doesn't Pay"" argument, without ever coming close to preaching. The message is loud and clear: Choose a life of crime, and eventually you'll wind up either murdered, in prison, or hiding for the rest of your life in the witness protection program, and this holds no matter how tough, how powerful, how well-connected, or how smart you think you are. Maybe it should be shown to youthful offenders headed down the wrong path, who after seeing it, could be asked to explain exactly why they may still want to become criminals - I'd love to hear their answers."

","It happened again.  Just as America's greatest living (greatest ever?) director created the best film of the decade in 1980 -- ""Raging Bull"" -- and lost the Oscar to Robert Redford's ""Ordinary People"" (an outrage by all accounts), yet another thespian's pretentious film -- Kevin Costner's ""Dances With Wolves"" -- beats out one of the best acted, best directed, most kinetically charged and most entertaining/horrifying films ever created... ""GoodFellas""<br/><br/>This is one hell of a ride.  Everything in the film is perfect.  The soundtrack perfectly mirrors the time period (musically and lyrically, from ""Rags to Riches"" to ""My Way"").  Joe Pesci is a revelation.  Of course he could be a thug, but they way his Tommy DeVito enters every shot as an unknown factor -- ""Is he going to snap?"" is the only thing we can think of -- gives the film an edge that would not have been the same with another actor.  Robert DeNiro is, of course, terrific, and Ray Liotta inhabits the character unlike he's done since.<br/><br/>But the real star is Martin Scorsese.  Just when it seems that ""Raging Bull"" would be his apex, I think ""GoodFellas"" may top it, on the basis of scope and technique.  It's not just a man as in ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver,"" his other legendary works.  It's a whole lifestyle, a way of being.  And it follows three decades of a ""family's"" rise and fall.  And there is never a slow or tedious moment.  The movie is raw action.  Whether it's the hellish tracking shots or the point of view shots or the way the trunk lets off an evil red glow, everything is for a reason.  And the double voice-over technique is brilliant, because it gives two different perspectives of mafia life.<br/><br/>""GoodFellas"" does not try to glorify the mob life... it just presents it as it is, blood and all.

","If there was a film that could come close to being better than my favourite film of all time, it would be GoodFellas. This film is so well done, it left me thinking about it for days. Martin Scorsese took a credible true story (based on the book ""Wiseguy""), a superb cast (Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, Joe Peschi, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino) and did his usual magic creating interesting shots and a film that flows very smoothly.<br/><br/>Some might say that GoodFellas has nothing on either of the first two Godfather films, however, I have to disagree. The Godfather films were based on a family and the happenings throughout the years, while GoodFellas takes a much simpler story about a local group of Mafioso and the problems they have with themselves. Where the Godfather films trace the wars between the mafioso, GoodFellas traces the wars within a single group of mafioso.<br/><br/>I don't think there has ever been a more abrupt and to the point opening sequence than the one in this film. It prepares you for the violence and vulgarity to come, although there was less of it than I thought there would be. Contrary to what others say about this being a showcase for the ugly side of the mob, there are more great dramatic scenes than violent ones.<br/><br/>Perhaps this was the best film of the 90's, but who really cares. GoodFellas will remain in my mind as one of the greatest of all time, and as such I fully recommend this film to all. Watch for Samuel L. Jackson in a small bit role (I believe he even says a word or two).<br/><br/>9/10 stars."

I counted at least three examples of this phenomenon, but I will not explain them, lest I spoil the movie for someone else.<br/><br/>Although this movie was released the same year as Godfather III, it still stands on its own, due to the fact that it shows us another, lower level of organized crime.

I've seen the film countless times and after every viewing I appreciate it that much more. It should go down as one of the best films ever made.  Scorsese has done it again!"

","This movie is undoubtably one of my three favorite movies of all time. It is the best crime story to ever hit the silver screen. Maybe it's just an Italian thing DeNiro, Liotta, Pesci, Sorvino, and Bracco, perfect casting but no ones ever seemed to grasp the truth of the mafia like Scorsese. A must see for anyone!

"Haplo-4","9","0","0","26 March 1999"," A perfect Mob-movie - but....
","As always Scorcese manages to make a very ""artistic"" movie unlike all other directors. Like in the later movie ""Casino"" he let the leading actors tell the story while the pictures roll on and it is first in the later part of the movie he revolves and take up the ""normal"" movie-style with dialogue. I think that this is a perfect way of making a movie interesting but perhaps it is getting a little too used by Scorcece, because all of the movies I have seen of him, not so many, is made this way. De Niro and Pesci shows how perfect they are at acting together in a ""Mafia-movie"" and this is one of the better they made together - Casino is still my favorite. I especially like the way Pesci is acting, he is just perfect at being a crazy killer that don't take no for an answer. So I hope to see more Scorcece movies starring De Niro and Pesci, but lets make it in an other - but still unusual way Scorcese."

","Goodfellas is the best Mafia/gangster movie of all time, and one of the greatest movies ever. One of the greatest things about Goodfellas is the very wide range of emotions, moods, expressions, and atmosphere along with the very quick change between them. In a way the ending leaves you with a sort strange feeling, wondering 'should I be happy or sad?' In one way you even want to be a gangster because you see them laughing, happy, having fun and such a good time, but then suddenly it shows them killing or robbing the innocent, and then you don't really want to live like that. Sometimes even a mixture of the two settings to make you feel especially strange. It shows them both so well and at the same time that every person who sees the movie interprets it in a different way. Sometimes the mood they feel depends on the mood before the movie starts. I've heard many different ways people interpreted the movie's expressions and moods, but I always here one thing that's always the same; Goodfellas is one of the greatest movie's of all time."
"dr.gonzo-4","Null","0","0","26 March 1999"," The penultimate mafia flick
","First let me just say that GOODFELLAS is not only the best of its genre, but also my favorite movie overall. I've seen it about over a dozen times and can never get enough of it. Martin Scorsese is a master at telling Nicholas Pileggi's true-story novel about Henry Hill, a man who grew up in a Mafia family only to sell them out in the end.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting in this movie is equal to the story and direction, its superb! Robert DeNiro is excellent in a secondary role as the ruthless Irishman Jimmy, who's character I might add is up for parole in about 15 years. Ray Liotta is also very impressive as Henry, and I can't forget Joe Pesci who pretty much stole the spot as the insane/psycho Tommy.<br/><br/>Lastly, I just wanna speak a little on the film overall. It in no way tries to whitewash the mafia scene like the GODFATHER movies, rather it gives you a look inside, at its rawest. The scenes of violence in this movie will blow you away and they give the movie a strong sense of realism. By far Martin Scorsese's best film to date, combining great actors, a story that will definitely keep you watching > loved the voiceovers, and probably one of the best depiction of real-events I've ever seen on film. CASINO is also highly recommened!"
"AllenD","9","0","0","22 March 1999"," A classic gangster film in its own right.
","All gangster movies will inevitably be compared to ""The Godfather"" series, but this one shines because it takes a daring, and hugely successful risk in not playing it for serious drama the whole way. It actually almost succeeds in making you ""like"" Henry Hill and his crew of Wiseguys. With the witty narration and comedic style, it's almost a fun comedy...and then, suddenly, savagely, it wrenches you back to reality as the plot takes a sinister, nasty turn.<br/><br/>The classic scene in this picture has to be how Tommy (Joe Pesci) establishes the true maniacal menace of his character, without any *doubt*, and without any bloodshed. A lesser film would have shown you a few bloody examples of what Tommy is capable of as a sensational copout. The brinksmanship of the ""You think I'm funny?"" scene sells his character well before the trouble starts."

","GoodFellas is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It was a great movie because it had every type of movie in it. There was action, comedy, drama, and suspense. Not only was the movie great but the actors were great also. Some of today's best known actors were in it like Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Paul Sorvino. This movie was also nominated for six Academy Awards in 1990, including Best Picture, and Best Director. Joe Pesci did win the award for the Best Supporting Actor. The movie is about how the mob really was. How they worked, how they lived, why they killed, and why there really was a mob in the first place. The only thing I didn't like about it, was that every other word was a cuss word. Otherwise, it is a great movie. The whole movie was based on the best selling book, ""WiseGuy,"" written by Nicholas Pileggi. So if you want to see a great movie watch Goodfellas. It is very entertaining and a little surprise at the end."

","*BIG SPOILERS AHEAD*<br/><br/>This film is an epic and a classic. It is sad, occasionally funny, and always captivating. Every single character is brilliantly acted, and the viewer feels something whenever one of them is killed. At one point, the psychotic Tommy shoots a young kid called Spider in the foot for being to slow with their drinks. Some days later, Spider stands up for himself and tells Tommy to ''go f**k himself''. Tommy's friends treat this as a joke and congratulate Spider. The atmosphere is very jokey, until Tommy shoots the young man dead. This was one of the saddest moments in the film. One of the most brilliant moments is when Tommy, thinking that he is about to get made, walks into a room and realises that he is about to get killed in revenge for someone he brutally murdered earlier in the film. All the usually foul mouthed Tommy says in the brief period between realising and getting killed is ''oh, no''. Another brilliant part of the film is how Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro in an excellent performance) turns gradually from a likeable character into a man who kills almost all of his 'friends'. Another sad scene is when the police find various bodies, killed by Jimmy after the heist, while Eric Clapton's 'Layla' plays in the background. Drugs are eventually Henry's downfall, leading the police to him. Henry rats on his friends Paulie and Jimmy, for whom we don't feel nearly as sorry as we would have if he had ratted on them at the beginning of the movie. He is put in the FBI Witness Relocation Program, and so ends one of the best films in recent years, as Henry, a scared man, goes out in the morning in his nightgown to collect the paper, haunted by a vision of the dead Tommy shooting him. AMAZING FILM."

","The true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a gangster working his way up the mob hierarchy, this is a sensational, brilliantly acted film, which, I suspect, presents a more realistic picture of the mafia than ""The Godfather"", and that is in no way a criticism of that film.<br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese peoples his films with some of the most fascinating and repellent characters you never want to meet. ""Goodfellas"" is no exception. It has just about everything going for it, including a terrific soundtrack (catch Sid Vicious' manic ""My way"" at the end of the film). Perhaps most importantly, at a time when most films seem to be suffering from overlength, there is not a wasted or boring moment in the film's two and a half hour running time.<br/><br/>My only question is: when is Scorsese ever going to win the Oscar?"

","I have to pick ""Goodfellas"" over ""The Godfather"" as my favorite crime movie of all time.  Tough it is a tough call, there is not a minute of boring or wasted film in ""Goodfellas"", whereas I think ""Godfather"" could make for a snappier movie with 10-15 minutes worth of cuts in various places.  This is a fascinating ride through the criminal life of a boy who started out a dreamer, and who made it to the big time.  Like ""The Decline & Fall of the Roman Empire,"" this masterful piece takes you through the life of a would-be gangster all the way to his disgraceful end as a government turnkey.  Ray Liotta delivers the performance of a lifetime as the main character, matched equally by Lorraine Bracco as his supportive yet fearful wife.  The fact that this movie is based on a true story only serves to pique interest further.  This is a must see for any movie-goer and deserves its place among the top 100 movies of all time."

","What can I say about this classic gangster movie? It has everything-realistic and interesting characters, plenty of violence, plenty of comedy-it truly is great.<br/><br/>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Every character in this film is superb. It would take me a whole book to praise the characters in the film. They were all superb. Joe Pesci as Tommy De Vito was an absolute psycho in this film. The characters really had to watch what they said around him. The slightest most innocuous comment heard by De Vito sent him into a rage and he would stab, shoot and kill anyone who crossed him.This is the best part ever played by Joe Pesci in my opinion.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro as James Conway was great too. Whilst he could not be classed as a psycho he was rather scary and unpredictable at times. When things kicked off, he was mean and nasty.<br/><br/>Every scene in this movie is great so it would be hard to recommend individual scenes. I liked the scene where young Henry Hill got into trouble for not attending school. The school had sent a letter to Henry's father and his father had given him a beating. So you know what happened next? Henry's gangster friends grab the postman, rough him up and warn him not to deliver any more school letters to Henry's house.

","When a movie this good comes along, I break down like a little child and weep. What can I say, Martin Scorsesse is God. The way he employs the visual medium to spill his heart and soul is breathtaking. Goodfellas is THE movie about the Mafia,and criminals in general. As good as The Godfather trilogy is, this movie, in my opinion, is much better.<br/><br/>It's the little things in the film, like the way the characters banter and joke with one another, the way they hang out in bars and restaurants, the paroxysm of violence that occasionally mark their days, the way they celebrate eachothers birthdays and weddings, etc..., that help place this film way ahead of othersin its genre, including The Godfather 1 and 2.<br/><br/>
Martin Scorsesse does an excellent job of conveying the daily routine and lives of these mobsters, portraying them as basically sad hoodlums, no more and no less. Their spiral downward seems all but inevitable.<br/><br/>
All of the cast in this film are excellent, especially Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta. Fluid camerawork, masterful direction and great music are added to the mix to bring one, exhilarating piece of modern cinematic masterpiece. 'Nuff said."

","I've watched Goodfellas at least 15 times and each time I'm entertained and this is why.  The performances by all actors are superb.  Even if you're not an organized crime genre fanatic, but like stories with struggle, success and corruption, then check it out.<br/><br/>The narrative style of story telling gives you the feeling you're a voyeur watching (as all film audiences do) with a sense that you're getting away with something.  The first half is a story of young Henry's development from boy to young man and it's quite a fun trip.  As a young man, he achieves a level of success within the organization he is a `member' of and has a lot o fun in the process.  Then things get out of hand and there is a price for all the wrong doings of the past.<br/><br/>The last section's pace of the movie is awesome.  You get the feeling your spinning out of control with Henry and Karen during a Sunday where there is a lot of `errands' to get done while the Feds watch.  Paranoia is validated.<br/><br/>Scorsese's films do that to you.  They make you feel what's going on with the characters in the story."

I especially liked the aspect of how that the main character was taken from being a young boy through his life into the present.  I liked the aspect of how that they were close knit.  To me, it was kinda like a little anthropology study of a strange type of community.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone that is interested in what life in the mafia is truly like.  It may seem graphic, but that is what makes it good.  There is no sugarcoating.  On the other hand, they don't dramatize it to the point of losing its luster either.  It is a 10."
"exterminator_99","10","0","0","7 February 2002"," A Modern Mafia Tale
","For so long ""The Godfather"" and its superior sequel ""The Godfather: Part II"" were held up as the ultimate gangster movies.  There had been imitators, yet none could match the originality and sheer weight of the Corleone saga.<br/><br/>If anyone were to recreate the mafia genre, or at least redefine it, it would have to be someone with the right cultural baggage.  Martin Scorsese had already painted an indelible vision of New York through ""Mean Streets"", ""Taxi Driver"" and to a lesser extent, ""Raging Bull.""  In that sense, he was the perfect choice to direct a modern version of a genre that inspires, fears and captures the imagination of audiences on a similar level to science fiction.<br/><br/>Instead of rehashing the past of ""The Godfather"", Scorsese drew from a more recent past: the 1960's and 70's.  In fact Scorsese drew most inspiration from a book by journalist Nicholas Pileggi, entitled 'Wiseguy'.  After both men made contact with one another they set about creating a script for a film based upon the book.<br/><br/>The premise for the film is based around the true story of a 1980's court case involving an informant for a New York mafia family.  Henry Hill (Christopher Serrone) is a 13-year old boy growing up in 1950's Brooklyn. Awestruck by his daily mafia surroundings, Henry is drawn to the allure of a gangster's life.  While his father, of Irish stock, works away in a blue-collar life of drudgery, Henry sees the mafia as a way out to a life of glamour, girls, money and ultimately, respect.<br/><br/>He begins his journey as an errand boy for local crime boss Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino), collecting debts and doing damage when required.  As Henry says in the narration, ""I was earning more money at 14 than most of the adults in the neighbourhood.""  Absolutely and utterly enamoured with his new life, Henry is proud to be a mobster.<br/><br/>At this stage of the film, we feel as if we are in Corleone territory. Everything is nostalgic to the point of rose-tintedness, we as an audience are drawn to what the mafia represents: a tough guy fraternity that deals above the law.  Henry's ascension into the mafia life is something we view with a smile rather than a frown.<br/><br/>By the 1960's we catch up with the adult Henry (Ray Liotta).  Now 21 years old, he and his friend and cohort Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) are foot soldiers for boss Cicero.  Robbing trucks for cigarettes, clothing and alcohol, the two forge a name for themselves as good earners.  Despite their accomplishments, they pale in comparison the 'made' guys, the real Mafioso who run Cicero's shady underworld.<br/><br/>Scorsese introduces us to the Cicero family in a superb steadicam sequence early on in the film.  As Henry walks through a nightclub we are shown the caricatures of mafia hitmen.  He narrates over the top and presents us characters with names like Fat Andy, Frankie the Wop, Jimmy No Nose, Pete the Killer and Jimmy Two Times.  If one were to be not paying attention, you could be mistaken that you were watching ""Dick Tracy"".<br/><br/>One character not caricatured at all is Jimmy Conway, played by the great Robert De Niro.  Cool, calm, tough and quietly evil, Conway is the ultimate gangster, bristling with venom and style.  Due to his Irish background, Conway will never be made, yet his presence is enough to suggest that his standing on the ladder is a non-issue.  De Niro plays Conway brilliantly, drawing from his portrayl of Jake La Motta in ""Raging Bull"".  Once again, the tag team combination of Scorsese and De Niro just about makes the film, despite the overall excellence of the movie.<br/><br/>Henry climbs higher and higher up the ladder of the mafia, marrying a Jewish girl named Karen (Lorraine Bracco) along the way and forging a name for himself as a gangster who's 'got things worked out'.  He's earning big and the Cicero family is doing nicely.  It all goes pear-shaped when Henry's goals change: he acquires a mistress and begins dealing cocaine.  As his lavish tastes and dangerous lifestyle escalate, the workings of the Cicero family also begin to change.  The 1970's introduce new, more violent and extravagant opportunities to make money for Henry, Tommy and Jimmy, all of which start the rot.  It all begins to tumble down and Henry and Karen are forced to make decisions that could cost them dearly in the long run.<br/><br/>
""Goodfellas"" is blessed with outstanding performances all round.  Liotta's Henry is understated, yet we travel along his journey of self-destruction easily.  Like Henry himself, we are too caught up in the speed and glamour of the life to take stock of where he ends up.  Pesci is amazing as the volatile yet charismatic Tommy.  He won an Oscar for his role (and repeated this performance in 1995's ""Casino"") and it's obvious why.  The sense of unease mixed with humour around Tommy is a credit to Pesci's ability to invisibly and unassumingly flick the switch between joker and psychopath. Bracco is also strong as Karen.  She has since taken up a more subdued role on the television series ""The Sopranos""; also based on the mafia.  Also of note are Chuck Low as Morrie, Frank Vincent as Billy Bats and the late Catherine Scorsese as Tommy's mother.<br/><br/>Scorsese's collaborators Michael Ballhaus (cinematography) and Thelma Schoonmaker (editing) once again deliver.  Ballhaus captures the mood of each decade perfectly: the nostalgia and innocence of the 1950's, the power of the 1960's and the seedy 1970's, they are all captured brilliantly. Also of note is the final few scenes involving a coked-up Henry trying to do a million things at once.  The frenetic pace and quick editing of this section is a credit to both Ballhaus and Schoonmaker.<br/><br/>The director is in total control of proceedings, with the film never altering from its course.  The use of music is superlative, the costumes and overall mise en scene of the film is pure genius.  Scorsese hasn't matched ""Goodfellas"" since, and while ""Taxi Driver"" remains his best, ""Goodfellas"" ranks extremely close.<br/><br/>By the end of the film the viewer realises that they have witnessed a different kind of gangster movie.  Brutal, fast, exciting and violent, ""Goodfellas"" is the anti-""Godfather"".  It portrays the mafia life as an uncompromising and shady world, yet one that rewards those who play by its rules.  It is a difficult feat for the greatest of directors to create a movie that engrains itself on popular culture, but Scorsese once again delivers.  ""Goodfellas"" is the best modern gangster movie and ranks alongside ""The Godfather"" as the best of the mobster genre."

"mjensen-3","10","0","0","13 January 2002"," ""The Best Mob film ever""
","This is the best mob film ever.  Scorsese's directing is on top just as are Deniro's and Liotta's performances.  Joe Pesci plays the perfect psycopath and Deniro as usual gives a great performance as  he does in every other Scorsese film.  New generation, old tradition, that's exactly what this movie is all about. In the old tradition a wise guy would never kill a made guy, in the new tradition, a wise guy does kill a made guy but he can't get away with it.<br/><br/>
Does the Godfather deserve to be in the same category as Goodfellas?  ""I say Yes.""  There are three reason's why I think this is true.  1. The directing in both movies captures the reality of mob life and how their lives end.  2. The acting in both movies is superlative 3. The two movies depict the same subject but with  different stories. <br/><br/>I have to admit I think Goodfellas is much better than Godfather because the murder scenes in  The Godfather are too stylish and too made up. Goodfellas on the other hand is based on a true story and the violent scenes look real and you get that feel of reality in those scenes because it really did happen.  I'm not about to say Martin Scorsese is a better director than Coppola, but I feel that Scorsese's film Goodfellas has more emotion than Coppola's film Godfather. Remember that scene in Goodfellas when Deniro, Liotta, and Pesci are beating the life out of that made guy in the bar and you hear the music getting louder? That's what Scorsese does with his films. He uses music to enhance emotion in his movie's. Coppola does not do that, no music, no feeling, just a scene and a person. <br/><br/> Some people may not like the ending of Goodfellas. To tell you the truth, I didn't like the ending at first, but I saw it five more times and I like it now. I know the ending doesn't give us a reason not to be a gangster, but Scorsese didn't want this film to have a sad ending like Blow. He wanted to make this film funny and crazy because that's the way Nicholas Pileggi's mob life was, funny and crazy. Scorsese did this film his way, the Martin Scorsese way.  <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone who is a Scorsese fan.  I give it a 10 out of 10."

","THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT CONSTITUTES A SPOILER.<br/><br/>Does Goodfellas deserve to be compared to The Godfather?  Well, let's see. It should be stated, first, that I am not debating whether or not Goodfellas is a good film; it is a brilliant film and one of best of the 90's.<br/><br/>Goodfellas, like The Godfather, does a wonderful job of balancing scenes of gangster lifestyle, its affect on a domestic situation, and its affect on the individual.  Both films are beautifully shot, and the screenplays are superb-making Italian coloquialisms and steady torrents of profanity sound like works of art worthy of Faulkner and Hemingway.  But the real difference is Scorcese's ability elicit emotion in every shot, his ability to put meaning in every frame of film.  With music, composition, color, mis-en-scene, or acting, Scorsese's direction is masterful and ""on-purposes""; no scenes or shots are meant merely to establish a location or a situation: they all have underlying messages.<br/><br/>The simple truth is this: Scorsese is just a better director than Coppola. He, Scorsese, is a technical virtuoso, an unsurpassed master of movement, and a risktaker.  Don't agree?  Just watch the night club scene-moving through the bowels of the club set to doo wop music.  Is any scene in The Godfather as moving as this one?  As effective as  this one?  So, the question is, does the Godfather deserve to be in the same company as Goodfellas?"

","In my opinion, this is the finest gangster/mafia film ever made. De Niro is truly fantastic, and Pesci is at his finest. it is funny, tragic, and horrifying, and you walk away from it feeling as though you have come off a rolercoaster ride.<br/><br/>This is far better than any other gangster movie because it has such a wide range of emotions. The godfather is like war and peace, an  epic in terms of length and gravity. Goodfellas is like a diary written by napoleons aide de campe, showing the humour behind the campaign, detailing the backstage scenes, and tells you that Napoleon hates milk in his morning coffee."

","Scorsese is a genius.With Goodfellas, he demonstrates his full command of the medium. He uses every technique at his disposal to tell his story. He uses the camera like an artist uses a paint brush. With the use of voice over narration,freeze frame, long tracking shots,flawless editing and popular music to accentuate the atmosphere of each scene,he creates a masterpiece.He gets great performances from all his actors with an outstanding performance by Joe Pesci. Scorsese does a fabulous job of creating the feel of urgency and paranoia in the final segment. I don't think there is another director on the planet that could have translated the source material onto the screen as effectively as Scorsese has. A superb film in every respect."

","If I had my way, this is the film that all gangster & violence films should be measured up against. It sets all the standards which some films have since lived up to but most have failed miserably.<br/><br/>Dare I say it, it's better than Godfather 1 & probably even part 2, and that takes some doing.<br/><br/>The main reason, is the plot is kept simple, there's just the right amount of characters. Even Godfather 1 -if you can find a fault with it- probably has just one or two extra Italians to confuse you slightly.<br/><br/>This is gangster films & even films generally, at it's best.<br/><br/>Sure there's some gruesome & heartless scenes, and I felt for the innocent postman, but they fit in perfectly with the context of the film and create exactly the mood.<br/><br/>Of course, the main reason is that it's based on true accounts which you can easily believe.

","The only thing keeping this movie from being known as Scorsese's crowning achievement is that other movie he made known as ""Raging Bull"".<br/><br/>I have read many times how ""Raging Bull"" was the greatest movie of the 80's. That's probably true. This is possibly the greatest movie of the 90's (definitely in the top 3).<br/><br/>The thing that makes this movie so attractive to me is that Scorsese didn't set out to make another ""Godfather"". This isn't about Mafia Kings, or Crime Lords. This is about the lower level of people who are the ""soldiers"". These are the people who are several levels down from Don Corleone. Hence, the tone of the movie is much more raw, and violent.<br/><br/>Scorsese pays attention to every little detail in this movie. He uses so many different aspects of cinema in order to turn what may be a typical scene into something that you always remember. Examples of this include the brilliant camera work through the back entrance of the nightclub ; freeze frames that are accompanied with interesting narrative ; great shifts in scenes that highlight twists in the characters' minds. It is as though Scorsese had a whole bag of tricks that he was picking from to put into this movie - and they all work perfectly. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is implemented brilliantly. In some cases it places an exclamation point on a dramatic scene (when the opening chords of Cream's ""Sunshine Of Your Love"" play as the camera centers on James Conway you know something bad is going to be happening soon). In other cases it is used to give the viewer a sense of a time period (50's, 60's, 70's etc). Scorsese even shows the same scene twice from two different angles just to illustrate two different points of view...brilliant !<br/><br/>I could go on forever about this movie...but that would be ridiculous. The best way to illustrate just how brilliant Scorsese is, is to point out that this isn't even considered his best movie by many !!!!!"

He takes what could have been a cliched, one dimensional character and gives him life. Underneath all his boasts and jokes you can see a truly insane man waiting for something to set him off. It's scary just to watch him on the screen. You think he's gonna step out and smack you around. It's a damn shame that he hasn't made a movie since Leathal Weapon 4.

","""Goodfellas"" is the best film of the 90's, no doubt. Among mob movies it is topped only by the king of them, ""The Godfather"". The film is about the real-life story of Henry Hill, a young half-Sicilian gangster who eventually gave evidence to the FBI about his friends' organized crime activities, and then disapperead into the Federal Witness Protection Program. The movie takes place over a period of about 25 years. We see Henry become more and more powerful in ""the organization"", and then we watch his rapid decline. Along the way, Henry meets wonderful (well, not really) characters such as Tommy (Joe Pesci), and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). Both do an excellent job, especially Pesci, who copped a well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. It also stars Lorraine Bracco from ""The Sopranos"" as Henry's wife, Karen. The best, however, is Ray Liotta as Henry Hill himself. It is a wonder why he did not recieve an Oscar for Best Actor for this. Martin Scorcese directed and co-wrote the film, and this is just another way of confirming my belief that he just can't make a bad picture. 10/10, ****, VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

","This three-act morality play that glorifies a refugee who escaped the ""Mob Culture"" is appealing for many reasons and unappealing for many more!  As a star-making vehicle for Ray Liotta, it succeeds on the basis of his and Lorraine Bracco's nuanced portrayals.  GOODFELLAS should really have been named WISE GUYS but ran into name or prior copyright (?) confusion, I believe.         Following along many of the same heavily beaten paths of the two worthy GODFATHER movies of the 1970's, in GOODFELLAS, the Mob ""wise guys"" are amoral, capitalistic hedonists who try to succeed and attain the ""American dream.""  A much better movie made last year (TRAFFIC, directed by Steven Soderbergh) uncovered the sordid venality of drug pushers whose hypocritical ""family values"" are truly a sham.           In the GOODFELLAS storyline, the not-very-creatively scripted characters and their unmemorable dialogue receive highlighting and benefits by the director's quite creative and memorable use of pop music and camera tricks galore.  However, as the typical first-time viewer walks away from the end credits, one asks oneself: ""Did the justice system really win? Do bottom-dwelling psychopaths really get their comeuppance? and Are the plusses of such a frank movie more than the minuses (racial-ethnic stereotyping and epithets overflowing and rampant)?""            I suppose this crowd-pleaser is a landmark ""thrilling"" part of the Best American Movies of the Twentieth Century. Still, I found GOODFELLAS to be as offensive as PULP FICTION when it lowers its sights to scenes of mayhem and violence, gore and bloodsport.

The way a mobster lives, the insurance scams, the crime, the terrorizing, the money, and the death, and the way it is directed as a reality film incorporates the life of a gangster in many, many ways.

Every minute I loved it, and it completely engrossed me in its detailed epic portrait of mob life. Director Martin Scorsese uses narraration, pacing, freeze-frames, text, and color well to show a scene's mood. His ability to dissect a scene into parts with narration and brilliant pacing is shown here. Also, it has great death scenes and violence scenes, a staple of the Mafia movie.

","I live in Emeryville, California (near SF, CA, which is more well known than Emeryville), and one of my favorite ways to spend a couple of hours is to head over to Everett&Jones for Ribs and watch Goodfellas. From the beginning, it draws you in to the mafia life following Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) rise from childhood dreams of being a gangster along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci in an amazing role). From the beginning, Scorsese captures the romance and logic of being a gangster. Young Henry Hill saw the beauty of it all. ""It was out of respect"" he says, when kids carried his mother's groceries all the way home for her. ""It was better than being president"", he says. And why not? Gangsters seemed immune to police, law, having to pay bills. That's the beauty that draws you in. <br/><br/>Pesci plays the role of a hot-tempered gangster which is Robin Hood on-target. You can tell early on that this is a man who probably got stepped on when younger, and craved the respect given to gangsters. That makes him the most volatile of the trio since he constantly wants the respect from everyone, but sometimes doesn't command it. <br/><br/>DeNiro is, not surprisingly, great as Jimmy Conway, but between the central role that Liotta has and the character Pesci plays, DeNiro's character doesn't really stand out. That's not to say DeNiro didn't play the character well, just that the nature of his character, IMO, wasn't meant to stick out.<br/><br/>The music is a wonderful complement to the story. The fluid camera shots are amazing, especially after multiple viewings. There's one in particular where it follows Henry and Karen on their first real date. It's amazing. There's also another scene where the piano exit of Layla plays in the background. It's one of my favorites in the movie.<br/><br/>Geez, what else can be said. Great acting by everyone. The story flows like water. The characters are drawn perfectly and have a depth. You feel the rationale of these gangsters and even find yourself siding with them. No scene is wasted.<br/><br/>This is easily a 10/10, and to some extent, makes me rethink some other movies that I've rated a 9 or 10. Taking from Spinal Tap, this movie should be an 11. It is on my top 5 list of favorite movies. I liked it more than The Godfather (it's close, though). I've seen it a dozen times and it loses nothing with each subsequent viewing. If anything, it gains more and more of my admiration."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","0","23 May 2001"," There is something that Martin Scorsese can't do. There has to be. But evidently, that thing doesn't have anything to do with movies.
","Martin Scorsese's stunning gangster film Goodfellas is the true story of Henry Hill, a man that wanted to be a gangster for as long as he can remember, and who lived as a gangster for a significant portion of his life. Scorsese seems to suggest that his tendency toward a life of crime comes as a result of an unhappy childhood, particularly the brutal beatings that he received from his father as a kid. Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance as Henry Hill, and Robert DeNiro is just a bad-ass in the film. He makes an awesome gangster, and he just looks intimidating and interesting and impressive. True, the guy is just a phenomenal actor, but he can also play extremely opposite roles, such as the one he played in Scorsese's Mean Streets in 1973, as well as the nutcase Travis Bickle in Scorsese's Taxi Driver. Joe Pesci, also a Scorsese regular, and also a tremendously diverse actor, plays the part of the undeniably likeable but quick-tempered and highly ambitious Tommy, one of the most violent gangsters portrayed in the film (by the way, his similarity to Edward G. Robinson's performance as Rico Bandello in Little Caesar (1930) is extensive and unmistakable). On a trivial note, look for Scorsese's mother playing the part of Tommy's loving mother (almost a staple in Italian cinema) in the film. It's interesting that for a good portion of her screen time, she is telling stories from the past, exactly as she did in Scorsese's rather short film Italianamerican, which starred his mother and father as themselves.<br/><br/>Scorsese clearly sees something of himself in the young Henry Hill, given his fairly impoverished and physically unhealthy childhood in New York's Little Italy, where he was always fascinated by organized crime. His unique and expressive direction works perfectly to present the story of the life of Henry Hill, with the overall purpose of showing what life in the Mafia is like. The power, the money, the women, the cars, the color coordinated wardrobe, the special treatment by just about everyone, everything that comes as a benefit of being a gangster. On the other hand, the dark side of organized crime is equally presented. We see the loyalty turned to betrayal, the senseless murders, the self-aggrandizing acts that lead to one's own downfall (especially seen in the way that Tommy kills a `made' man named Bask), the occasional crackdown by the law, etc. But even when in prison, they get extremely favorable treatment, with their quarters, their food, and pretty much everything else about their treatment.<br/><br/>(spoilers) Even the extensive length of the film serves to increase the effectiveness of this presentation of gangster life, because it provides time for Scorsese to completely immerse the audience in the world of the Mafia, rather than tell about the life of some gangster with a story that is over in 90 minutes. The movie spans a time period of about three decades, from Henry Hill's first involvement with the Mafia, basically as an errand boy, until his eventual betrayal of his betrayers, leaving him stuck to live the rest of his life `like a schnook.' Earlier in the film, DeNiro's character, James Conway, tells the young Henry Hill that he had learned a valuable lesson from his first run-in with the police - `Never rat on your friends, and ALWAYS keep your mouth shut.' Henry is proud of this, and even at the end of the film, when he opens his mouth and rats on his friends, it is clear that it is not the way that he wanted it all to end. The tragedy here is that he has to spend the rest of his life living in a way that he always despised, as a `normal' person.<br/><br/>Even as Henry goes to the police, Scorsese is still illustrating the practices and realities of the Mafia. Henry notes that the cops talked to him, which assured him that they were not associated with the Mafia, because `goodfellas' (this is what the gangsters called each other - `You'll like this guy, he's a goodfella.') would have just killed him. He wouldn't have even heard anything. The Italian influence in the film is obviously unmistakable, both in the stereotypical (and, in reality, generally incorrect) involvement with the Mafia as well as everything from the way that they dress to the strong family bonds and the delicious meals. Goodfellas is an uncompromising and brutally straightforward look at the inner workings of the Mafia that makes no effort to make anything easy to swallow. I've heard people complain about gratuitous violence in the movie, such as when Henry walks up to some guy on his driveway and pistol-whips him for sexually assaulting his sister. This is crap, of course, because the guy got exactly what he deserved. I think they should implement pistol-whipping in the US court system as a common punishment for sexual assault. The violence is not put into a movie like this to impress the younger male audience that looks for that, it's put here because that's the way the Mafia works. This is realism, not audience manipulation, and the spectacularly effective result is a tremendous accomplishment."

","`Goodfellas' is a story about the glamour and allure of the mafia, told with the voice of nostalgic regret by Henry Hill (Ray Liota), a self proclaimed nobody, living a safe and dreary existence in the witness protection program.  Scorsese draws brilliant performances out of each and every one of his actors, scoring an Oscar nomination for Loraine Bracco (The Sopranos) and a win for Joe Pesci.  Pesci shows us a glimpse into true evil as Tommy DeVito, a man so caught up in power and greed that he's lost any semblance of humanity.  Liota's performance hits the mark as well.  Each time a murder is committed in his presence, he has a brief moment with the camera in which he agonizes over the realization that it is just another part of the job. His understated performance somehow allows the viewer to actually sympathize with his situation.  `Goodfellas' is about a family.  Liotta's kids know their Don as `Uncle Pauly' and literally jump up and down with enthusiasm at the prospect of going to his place for dinner.  They cook together, laugh together, and dig graves together.  Don't miss it!"

","Scorsese's film Goodfellas is a hard one to catalogue. It is an absolute cinematic masterpiece, see the excellent tracking shots (entering the copa by the back way) and also the tense, and sweaty final scene. I have no complaints with the impeccable acting from Liotta, De Niro, and Lorraine Bracco. Joe Pesci seems to exaggerate in his portrayal of Tommy (a role which he practically copies in Casino)but I think he deserved the oscar nomination.I also have no qualms with soundtrack which is one of the finest collections of songs around, neither the scenes which although follow short narratives have an electricity about them that makes them interesting. I'm not sure about one thing or whether anyone else shares my views, but is it fun to watch something like this? These people are the lowest, slimiest, lowlifes on Earth! A question which often came to me during the film's excellent scenes was whether one feels sympathy for the characters? Not really. All of them are backstabbers and unlike other scorsese films there is no real redemption. Hill gets what he deserves. Pesci also gets what he deserves and de Niro's character is truly detestable as he tries even to kill Henry's wife. This is a question which has often crossed my mind whether it is important to feel sympathy for a character, or is it simply enough to feel any sort of emotion be it sympathy or utter dislike. In Raging Bull I'm certain that some of us watching were frightened by De Niro's portrayal of LaMotta as the evil in him was sometimes far to close to evil we have sometimes felt ourselves, it finishes, though with his redemption. Also the characters in Mean Streets, Scorsese's best film, are likeable even down to Johnny Boy who being a nut is still funny and played with pathos by the ever present De Niro. So what happened in Goodfellas? I'm not sure Scorsese would want us to love the film, appreciate it yes, but love it and praise it I don't know. It is a great character study, but, of lowlifes, people we really wouldn't want to meet."

","For those of you who say that this is nothing like ""The Godfather"", you're right. ""The Godfather"" is about the Mob life at the top (white collar). ""Goodfellas"" is about Mob life at the working man's level (blue collar). Both show their home life and their working life, but are very different.<br/><br/>In ""The Godfather"" Corleone's gave the word, or in some cases, the nod to have someone whacked. In ""Goodfellas"" these guys were the ones who carried out the order to whack someone. So you can not really compare the two. I like the idea of watching a Mob movie and not hearing that stereotypical Italian music playing in the background. The regular music of the day is what is more believable and enjoyable, at least to me.<br/><br/>
We are lucky to get to see DeNiro is both of these films and what a performance he gives. No surprise. Liotta is ""charming"" as the new kid on the mobster block. Though his character never kills, he does just about everything else. Pesci steals the show as the sick f**ker who can kill without any thought. Lorraine Bracco is stunning as Liotta's wife. It is interesting to see the two of them as they get swepted away in the muck of the underworld. She knows she should get away from this, but can't because it's kind of a turn on. <br/><br/>(**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**) The two best scenes for me is when the camera is following Liotta and Bracco through a restaurant from the alley to their table without a cut. All done with such a grand flow. Perfectly shot with ""Then He Kissed Me"" playing in the background. The other is when all those mob ""buddies"" start showing up dead one by one, with that erie music playing in the background. Can't think of the song, but is was terrific and terrifying at the same time. (**END OF SPOILER**)<br/><br/>Yes, ""The Godfather"" was brilliant but DO NOT rule out ""Goodfellas"". View it as the other side of the coin in the Mob world. Perfectly acted, scripted and shot, and with a killer soundtrack to boot. Watch it or get whacked!!"

","If there is one comment that could truly do justice to a film as great as Goodfellas it is this: If you are tired of the mindless subordinant trash that Hollywood releases year after year then by all means see Goodfellas. Now I know what everyone is thinking Ray Liotta is in it and he hasn't exactly had the best film career to date but trust me when I say that he gives a performance like none you will ever see in a film. The way he portrays the flawed nature of Henry Hill is simply brilliant. Robert De Niro accompanies Liotta's presence with something only De Niro can accomplish when he steps out in front of that camera. It is amazing that in De Niro's over 30 years in the business he has made only one, yes one, error ( Rocky and Bullwinkle.) This man never ceases to amaze me. The way De Niro is able to portray each and every character of his is uncanny and evident in this picture. Throw in the Academy Award winning performance of Joe Pesci and the once again ingenius directing of the man who can not fail, Martin Scorsese, and you have what is known as one of the greatest films in the history of film.

His character, Tommy Devito, is one sick b****rd.  Yet, I like his sense of humor, especially when he asked, ""How am I funny?""  Whenever I watch that scene where he asks Henry Hill that question, it's hard for me to keep a straight face.  Pesci just cracks me up.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro does the role of Jimmy Conway well.

"henfish","9","0","0","6 February 2001"," Engrossing movie making with minor reservation(s)...
","I caught this terrific movie on TV again last night and, not for the first time, thought how wonderfully riveting this brilliantly directed and sublimely acted film is.  The dialogue never appears to hit a false note; the situations are frequently, sickeningly engrossing and the ensemble playing is as natural as breathing.  Yet it was whilst enjoying this latter part that I realised a potential flaw in this otherwise flawless gem: It dawned on me that - of the evil triumvirate at the heart of this film (Pesci [frighteningly superb]; De Niro and Liotta) - only Henry Hill (Liotta) is given the scope by writer and director to show any humanity throughout several of the story's more callous moments.  Is this because he was the only gangster with any humanity at the time of the Goodfellas?  (Possibly). Or is it perhaps because the film is based directly on his testimony (in which case - he would allow himself be occassionaly human in a world of unfeeling animals: wouldn't he?)?  Call me cynical, but watch for yourself. <br/><br/>
Anyway.  That's the only potential flaw.  That and the fact that, three quarters of the way in - as Liotta focusses on drug running - Scorsese decides to produce twenty minutes of a completely different style of movie! Oh, and Lorraine Bracco's bravura performance being shamefully underrated by far too many reviewers (which is, of course, not a flaw of the film!).  And finally the fact that, even though this film has existed for over a decade (and therefore the evidence that fine writing helps fine direction and fine direction helps fine acting and - NEVER! - these things altogether add up to classic cinema) Hollywood will still, on the whole, prefer to go for chaos over character and Janet and John dialogue over a literate script!

Because of that, I held off on seeing this one until about a year after its release.  Boy did I miss out!!!  This is GREAT, and although the names of many people are changed, it rings true with actual gangland life in the period it covers. (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS WITHIN TEXT) Ray Liotta plays real-life ex-mobster Henry Hill, who is gradually sucked into ""the life"" and rises and falls with it over about 25 years time. Although not a lead in this film, Robert DeNiro looks truly deadly in this film as ""Jimmy the Gent.""  He pretty much steals the show away from the real principal actors.  Joe Pesci is great as the nasty-mouthed Tommy, whose temper eventually lands him in his own trouble.  Lorraine Bracco is convincing enough as Henry Hill's wife. I especially thought that Paul Sorvino was chilling as Pauly, obviously a higher ranking boss than the rest of the ""street guys.""  It's not so much the lines he delivers (""don't make a schmuck outta me!"") but rather the facial and eye expressions that give a deadly presence here.<br/><br/>What I like about this movie is that it was one of the first really good ones to show gangsters operating at the street level.  Instead of buying up half of Las Vegas with one sitdown, they are shown hustling from one ""score"" to another; rich one day and broke the next.  It also shows that loyalty and friendship are two different things. I once heard real-life gangster Jimmy Fratianno say in an interview ""what does friendship have to do with anything?!....if you gotta go...you go!"" In Goodfellas, this is proven time and time again. We see people who have been friends all their lives casually kill eachother as if they are ordering a round of drinks.  So much for the good-life. This is not a film for impressing a first date with, guys.  It is a non-stop barrage of four-letter words and some pretty nasty violence.  But it is far more realistic than most of the ones that preceded it. <br/><br/>Put it this way, after a character in the film gets ""whacked,"" all the killer says is, ""and that's that.""  Pretty much sums up the way things are dealt with if you screw up in ""the life,"" whether you are right or wrong.

Joe Pesci is hilarious and amazing in his performance as a lifelong gangster with two deadly & volatile traits:  A short temper and a chip on his shoulder.  While all of the performances in this movie are very strong, Pesci was clearly in his element here.  <br/><br/>It's a shame that Martin Scorsese was once again cheated out of the Best Director Oscar he so rightfully deserves in favor of Kevin Costner's directing of ""Dances With Wolves"" in 1990.  This movie would have never been even close to the film it was had it been without Scorsese's amazing filmmaking skill behind it.  The Academy better be ready to hand Marty one hell of a lifetime achievement award one of these days because after close to 30 years of being one of the greatest directors of his time, he has yet to be rewarded with an Oscar.  The fact that ""Raging Bull"" was ripped off for a Best Picture Oscar in 1980 was bad enough, not giving Marty the Oscar he deserves after all these years, especially in lieu of making two films in the last decade that he clearly deserved to win for (Casino being the other one) is just salt in the wound at this point.

The idea to start the film with Tony Bennett's Rags to Riches which is perfect as it fit's Henry Hill's life from something to nothing and don't get me started on the scene where lot's of gangsters wind up dead in many places with the beauty of Derrick and the Domino's Layla in the background just works on so many levels.<br/><br/>But the story alone is just fascinating to see how a character like Henry started his life as a somebody and for it to end in Henry Hill's remaining last words `an average nobody'.   I can't remember which film it was that was up against Goodfellas at the Oscars, I think it was Dances With Wolves but how do you watch a film like Goodfellas and then lose out to a director Oscar To Dances With Wolves.  Don't get me wrong I love Dances With Wolves but Goodfellas is every director dream of a true gangster biopic.  Let's face it, the only Oscar Scorsese is ever going to see is probably a Life Time Achievement award and he will probably be dead if they were going to give it to him but I maybe wrong with The Aviator Coming up.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta out does himself with Goodfellas and he is still not as known as an actor as he should be, by just watching this and other films like Copland and Narc you know he is just a dynamite actor who doesn't star in so many films.   Robert De Niro is on top form as is Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino but the one thing that stands out most in this film is the editing by the great Thelma Scoonmaker.  Her quick cuts in between scenes is what makes Goodfellas such an outstanding achievement and the same goes for the cinematography.  Just look at the scene where Henry takes Karen to a posh club and the camera starts rolling from outside when they both get out of the car and they go through the back way going passed many people and going through the kitchens and backstage area without the camera cutting is just a stroke of genius and he does the same in Raging Bull and Gangs of New York and this is what I admire a lot and most in Scorsese Films, the way he just turns a simple scene into something so outstanding it makes the film more original.  I am a film student and I have tried to do these shots without any shake and continuity and it's quite hard and very challenging to get it just right so when watching Goodfellas it just stands out in my mind and always will which is what makes Goodfellas so special as it contains some of the best Acting, Directing, Editing, Cinematography and Musical Soundtrack I have ever seen."

","The Godfather series never rang completely true, with its glamorized portrayal of noblesse oblige within the criminal underworld. GoodFella's does with its portrayal of petty criminals and psychopaths who's noblesse is completely self serving and without compassion in dealing with anything that comes in their way. Deniro and Pesci are brilliant in their roles as wise guys (sociopath and psychopath respectively). Ray Liotta is good as a small time hood with a bit of heart who deals drugs and turns informer. His role is probably more sympathetic than is the real Henry Hill on whom the character is based, but it does provide an emotional bridge for the audience into a world of brutality, retribution, greed and treachery.

Also, look at the famous shot in which the camera follows Henry and Karen from their car all the way to their table.  It is almost four minutes long!!!<br/><br/>The camera work again comes into play in a more subtle manner in certain scenes of the movie.

GoodFellas shows Scorsese at his best. The story is riveting, the performances; extraordinary, and the ending, although not a surprise, packs an enormous punch. What distinguishes it from the other great gangster films (Hawks' Scarface [and DePalma's],  Coppola's Godfather I & II ) is not its  themes, but rather their depiction. Never before has a film so thoroughly captured the JOY, danger, and ultimately, the desperation of  ""Family"" life. One of the world's great films."

","This movie is a stunning cinematic achievement. At the core is Ray Liotta, who should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award. You can visibly see his transformation from a young, energetic gangster to an older, paranoid man constantly on the run. Complimenting his performance is the beautiful Lorraine Bracco, one of the most underrated actresses working today, who turns in a stellar (also Oscar-worthy) turn as his mob wife. The rest of the cast is superb, most notably Joe Pesci who shines in his Oscar-winning role. Scorsese picked nothing but the best when it came to casting. The entire movie is backed by classic music which adapts to each decade we're watching, starting in the 30's and 40's and ending up in the 80's. The wedding, family dinners, jail scenes and the infamous nightclub are nothing but genuine. I truly believe this movie should have received more credit, awards and merit. I was also happy to see that Robert DeNiro did not have a huge part in this movie. As I respect him as being one of the greatest actors in recent times, Scorsese was wise in shifting attention of Liotta. It is not to say that DeNiro had a small part, but it seemed that he was in a supporting role, contrary to other gangster movies he has starred in, like ""Casino"" where he is the main character.<br/><br/>The best scene? Without a doubt, the 3 minutes when Liotta and Bracco enter the Copacabana Nightclub through a sub-level entrance. As they wander through the halls and corridors of the kitchen and waiting areas, viewers get a first hand look at behind the scenes of a classic nightclub, all set to ""The He Kissed Me"" by The Crystals.<br/><br/>This is a fine piece of work Scorsese has created, and I strongly recommend seeing it."

","Actor Robert DeNiro and director Martin Scorsese are among the very best in their respective fields. They have been a very successful team on such classic films as Raging Bull, Mean Streets, Casino and Cape Fear. Goodfellas is the very best film they've made together.

The story, the acting, directing, the music used all blend together perfectly. Ray Liotta, a terrific and underappreciated actor, plays Henry Hill, who gets involved as a kid with the local mobsters in his neighborhood. It is based on a true story told in Nick Pilleggi's book ""Wiseguy"". Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his supporting role. The cast also includes such stars as DeNiro, Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco as Henry's wife. There are alot of classic movie moments, including a hilarious scene with Catherine Scorsese as Pesci's mother. <br/><br/>Goodfellas is an awesome movie.

Henry Hill gives us first person narration in his rise through the ranks of the mob.  He goes from being a small time hood, to a major player. Along the way, we meet his partners in crime: Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVitto.  These two are played with finesse and bombast by Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.  We get glimpses into the lives of wiseguys.  They have money, power and girls.  But underneath the glossy surface, there's always the treat of violence that could erupt at any time.  An off the cuff remark from Henry sends Tommy into a rant that borderlines a catastrophe.  Scorsese pulls no punches in delivering the violence that fills the lives of these people.  Life in the mob is not a glamorous life, it's filled with threats, violence, and paranoia.  One of the best sequences in the film is toward the end where Henry starts out his day at 6:55 AM and it gets worse from there. Scorsese pulls you into Henry's frantic world by the voiceover, and pretty soon, you're concerned about the dinner that Henry is planning.  Goodfellas is one of the best films ever made about life in the mob.  It shows the highs and the lows, and the danger that lays in each."

The combination of a tight, interesting plot and vividly realized characters always makes for a good film, but the realism imbued by Hills story makes this a truly superior gangster flick.<br/><br/>The screenplay (Co-written by Scorsese and Pillegi) and the cinematography capture the sudden violence of the street in a way you don't see in most over produced set pieces (think Die Hard).  What most impresses me is how penetrating and accurate Ray Liotta's voiceovers are. The freeze frames and quick cuts between characters vividly convey the way a player figures things out when working the streets; showing how they compute the angles and figure out what lurks beneath the surface, is masterful, conveying a realism I've never seen in film, especially not in some stylized crime films like the Godfather."

","Back in the 70's, Francis Ford Coppola gave us ""The Godfather"" and infused into film-goers an infatuation with the Mob and their ways of life. Many felt that the 3 GF films 'glamourised' the Mob in many ways as people started to associate not only violence but family ties and loyalty to them. Then came the 90's and we have Martin Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"", a hard-hitting, no-holds-barred look at the life of a mobster through 3 decades. The traits of the Mob were still there,ie:violence, trust/betrayal, family abuse, loyalty..etc etc, but Scorsese's film brings us deep into the world of his characters. It shows us the perks and 'highs' of being a gangster, then slaps us in the face with its sudden outbursts of violence n dangers, sucks us in as they spiral towards their eventual downfall and leaves us exhausted from the ride. In the end, we see clearly that crime doesn't pay - a message which the Godfather films fail to emphasise properly. Fast-paced and narrated by the main character himself, the film has a voyeuristic feel made even more so by the great camerawork. Excellent soundtrack which seem to blend perfectly with each era and scene. A fresh and unique change from the slow moving grandeur of the GF films.

Ray Liotta is wonderful as Henry Hill, a man who only slowly realizes he has gotten way over his head.  Joe Pesci's performance is rightfully considered a classic, and DeNiro gives us what he always gives us-  this time in a supporting role.

The trick with Goodfellas is its searing honesty, Scorsese shys away from nothing, showing graphic violence in all of its beautiful brutality, and switching the upbeat, often lighthearted first half of the movie with the coke-induced paranoia of the second act is masterfully done.

This movie is not driven by fantasy or great one-liners, yet it is totally engrossing. The violence is sickening but motivated. These men are ruthless, they are not characters in a movie jockeying for attention. They are pure Machavelli, what is expedient is necessarily right. In this life, if it is more convenient to have you dead... watch your back and never trust your friends especially if they are smiling.<br/><br/>This is the real Mafia; life at its most dangerous. A complex game where everything is for sale and anyone is expendable. Whatever works is right. Machavelli himself couldn't have a better movie demonstrating his theories."

","Forget everybody who say that GoodFellas is the greatest gangster film since the Godfather, GoodFellas is the greatest!<br/><br/>It is Martin Scorsese's finest film to date and how it did not sweep the Oscars the way Godfather did, is beyond me! I guess the Academy was once again intimidated by Scorsese's sheer brilliance and realism!<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is as usual magnificent. Lorraine Bracco gives one of thefinest performances I have seen from a woman for ages. Ray Liotta also gives a super performance and in many respects is the driving force behind the film. But it is Joe Pesci who steals the show! He won an Oscar for his performance and that is the least he deserved..... the greatest performance of his life!!!!!! Even the minor parts are played brilliantly!<br/><br/>The film has it all... thrills, spills, humour, drama and even sadness! You will remember it forever, the quotes will stay in your head for years!<br/><br/>If you see one last film in your lifetime, it HAS to be GoodFellas!!!!"
"RSKIKR","10","0","0","21 October 1999"," Don't be so dogmatic!
","I've seen this film many times over and it never fails to amaze me how people can criticize Ray Liotta's performance. Liotta's character is pivotal to the overall plot. Because he does not live up to a stereotype of a gangster, people deem his performance as flat and uninteresting. Remember, Liotta's character says ""I always wanted to be a gangster"" not ""I was born to be a gangster"". Over the course of the film, you can see Liotta's character slowly dislike the life he wanted to be so much apart of. The fact that Liotta's character is only half Italian only highlights this point. Other scenes like when Henry sees Jimmy and Tommy after the death of Stacks and when all three are at Tommy's Mother's House further show Henry's remorse for his life decisions. And at the very end of the film when he's commenting on how he missed the old times, he seems to be happy. As the Sid Vicious music starts and we see Henry going back into his house, he does so with a smile, even when he slams the door and we here the slam of the ""cell doors"". Henry is content with the life he has, even if it means he has to remain anonymous for the rest of his life. Liotta's performance as Henry Hill is one of the most subtle and restrained performances I've seen in recent memory. Its a pity that people have to listen to the comments of critics to form their own opinions. People should see the movie and form their own opinions first before running to the newspaper stand and reading the what the critics say. Let's be a little bit more independent in our thought and less dogmatic."
"BigDog-18","Null","0","0","19 October 1999"," Worth seeing again
","I watched this again recently and was amazed at much better it is when not compared to the Godfather. Joe Pesci creates an unforgettable character in Tommy - both horrifying and funny. Ray Liotta does his best work since ""Something Wild"" and more than holds his own against Robert DeNiro. Look for some excellent supporting work from Lorraine Bracco, Debi Mazar and Paul Sorvino. The running narration (normally overused and worthless i.e. ""Bladerunner"") works here because it feels like Henry is talking to us casually, like we're sitting at the same bar and he's unfolding this story. The soundtrack is excellent. My only complaint is the length. I felt that the whole ending could have been shortened by 20 minutes or so. There is a long sequence of events regarding Henry that are totally uneccessary. Watch this with some red wine and a Hot Italian hoagie dripping with sauce. Bravissimo!"
"LoveCoates","4","6","21","31 July 2001"," Classic direction, though schizophrenic.
","This film is considered the definitive mob film, probably more because Martin Scorsese is quite possibly the best living American director. If Francis Ford Coppola (director of ""The Godfather"" trilogy) were still alive, he may disagree with this assessment -- and if he did, I would have to agree with him.<br/><br/>Granted, the direction is brilliant, especially on the opening credits, the beginning of Liotta's flashback, the psychedelic feel of the end, and the stunning tracking shot that introduces Liotta and Bracco's first date, but there are so many postmodern innovations that the viewer is veritably jarred. With repeated viewings (which have made this film a classic) this alienation is felt less so, but there is nothing here to challenge Coppola's christening scene.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, not enough can be said, especially about this movie's acting. Pesci's star-turn is celebrated, but kudos must also go to the always underrated Liotta whose subtley suits his role perfectly. De Niro is wasted but good playing the role he always plays (could he be anything less than good?) and Paul Sorvino is perfectly understated in a supporting role. The real praise must go to Lorraine Bracco, the only character to experience a full spate of emotions. She is the most convincing female character ever in a gangster film and doesn't have enough scenes, to my taste.<br/><br/>The plot - what little there is - weakens the film. The main character's ambiguous goal is to become a gangster, but this does not drive the film. Events happen to him, rather than grow out of his own actions making him difficult to sympathize with. The unsatisfying ending is too quick (as if Scorsese knew his movie was getting a tab bit overlong) and also unsatisfying, though he did the latter on purpose as a point of theme.<br/><br/>Overall, a must-see film, though I prefer the better-directed and more engaging plot of ""Casino,"" which, unfortunately is often-panned as a rip-off of this film. Both film's are ridiculously and violent unlike the early Hollywood gangster flicks which were juist as - if not more - thematically effective."

I've honestly watched this movie long and hard and realized that this movie isn't all that funny either. Comedy movies should be funny and this movie just didn't cut it. I highly recommend that if your at the video store anytime soon and your picking a movie do not pick this one because it is fake, unfunny and lame. Joe Pesci was boring and looked old and had absolutely no screen presence. I watch lots of movies and i now know that this is a movie that shouldn't and must not be watched by any living human being who has a brain. Robert De Niro looks fat and uninteresting. Ray Liotta looks like a store robbing punk and Pesci and looks like some fat old guy who bring me my paper in the morning. My favorite part of the movie was when it was over. This has got to be on my top 10 worst movies. That guy from See Spot Run was in the movie but he just played some boring overweight guy who i didn't care for. The guns looked like something you could buy from the $2 shop and the blood looked like tomato sauce. George Lucas should have directed this movie, unlike this movie his Star Wars series especially the last 3 (the most recent) were examples of his directing excellence which made him billions of dollars.

I had to make the mark because I didn't and still don't know what are the main elements of this plot or even where is the story. The movie, as I see it, is focusing on unimportant events and manners. I'm afraid that if I didn't click that icon and talked about, let's say, any trivial thing in any trivial party in this trivial based movie; I would be put n the blacklist.<br/><br/>IMDb is always the place I visit before watching any movie; most of the times, I find the rating of it's users rather useful; and some other times, it turns out to be a great shock after watching the movie. The latter case happened with ""Goodfellas"" as it happened with ""Godfather"" and some other movies. It's of course a difference of view points; but sometimes it is just confusing to me.<br/><br/>I gave the movie three out of ten just because of the great cast and the good performance. As a regular watcher, I just see the performance, the story, and to a certain point: the direction.

","'Goodfellas' by Martin Scorsese is a highly entertaining gangster film that takes us as the audience away from the typical representation of the gangster life that we are familiar with. The gangster life appears glorified and made to look glamorous;this is an interesting approach that Scorsese has taken as from start to finish the audience does not feel much negativity towards the gangsters and we almost feel sorry for them. Overall, it is a very good film with an interesting angle that is analytically highly interesting as well as entertaining. I do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone as it will show them the mafia in a different light as well as being very enjoyable to watch."
"classicsoncall","9","2","5","3 September 2011"," ""The way I saw it, everybody takes a beating sometime"".
","The first time I saw ""Goodfellas"", I didn't realize it was based on the Nichlas Pileggi book 'Wiseguy'. A lot of stuff seemed so familiar, and of course, the name Henry Hill was the tip-off, a non-Italian in the world of Mafioso high rollers and hit men. I read the book shortly after it came out, and the movie seemed to come out very quickly after. I don't remember a whole lot about the book now, but some of the things that stand out are the Air France job, the Lufthansa heist, and that bit about feeding a guy to a lion. Oh yeah, and the burial, exhumation and reburial of Billy Batts. You have to admit, ""Goodfellas"" has the best ba-da-bing opening of all time when Tommy (Joe Pesci) goes berserk on Batts in the car trunk and just keeps wailing.<br/><br/>I've read a few of the other comments in the reviews section for this picture, and can only chuckle at a few of the naive posters who think that what happens on screen here is forced and not very believable. I can only surmise that they didn't grow up in New York or it's suburb environs, because mob rub-outs were a staple on the front pages of the New York Daily News and The Post throughout the Sixties. Usually they more closely resembled Michael Corleone's first hit in the Italian restaurant in ""The Godfather"", but nevertheless, this kind of brutality did occur. Although I have to say, the way Tommy whacked Michael Imperioli was a little over the top.<br/><br/>I guess the most memorable scene in the movie for me was Pesci giving Ray Liotta the business in that 'who's funny' routine. For first time viewers, you're not really sure where Tommy's going to take things because he's such a loose cannon. Then suddenly, Pesci calls himself on it, and you know full well he was playing around with the new kid. The character Pesci was portraying, real life mobster Tommy DeSimone, was in fact a young aspiring gangster with psychopathic tendencies specializing in truck hijacking and stolen goods.<br/><br/>So for those who think ""Goodfellas"" is the best gangster flick ever, fair enough, but putting it up against the first two 'Godfathers' is a little bit of a stretch for my money. I also prefer the Coen Brothers' take on crime in ""Miller's Crossing"". But this one's based on a true story, and you can't get more real than some of the outrageous things that happened in the life of wise guy Henry Hill. For an outsider, he could be a real goombah."
"Kubris","10","2","5","22 August 2011"," You really are a funny guy!
","IMDb Top 250: 15 Goodfellas is one of the best films ever. It's dramatic, charming, crazy and even a bit funny. Chronicling the rise and fall of wiseguy Henry Hill from the 50's to the 80's, Goodfellas is the best look at mob life... after the Godfather. This is Scorcese's best work that I have seen.<br/><br/>The plot can be summarized very easily: Henry Hill wants to be a gangster, and when he becomes one he lives the life, good and bad. A biography like this could be shown in an average way, but it has the Scorcese touch. The presentation of Goodfellas is, in my opinion the most interesting and engaging in film. Period music plays throughout, Hill and Karen narrate with charm, and the pacing is perfect. Goodfellas doesn't have a dull moment.<br/><br/>The characters are top-notch cinema, interesting and flawed. Hill, our anti-hero, is a charming Irish-Italian nobody who becomes a somebody. He looks cool, talks cool, and acts cool, until he gets in over his head with products and problems. Jimmy Conwa is the high roller, stuffing everyone's pockets with money, playing it cool until his neck is on the line. And Tommy, dear volatile Tommy, whose voice and actions steal the show, is an Italian fireball who is unpredictable. All expertly acted, these are the guys you wish you could be. Karen is also well-acted, from innocence to involvement. The entire cast of Goodfellas are personalities.<br/><br/>This film has its share of incredible cinematic moments. From the pistol-whipping to the montage of deaths, every scene is crafted with care. Two in particular have stood above the rest though: the famous ""How am I funny?"" speech, a highlight of the rapid-fire dialogue, and the long shoot, showing Henry and Karen's date from a single perspective. Genius directing.<br/><br/>The mood is wonderful, helped profusely by the music. Starting with oldies to show the golden age of gangsters, the music progresses in the same direction as the plot. It's unbelievable. When you hear songs from the movie, you think of Goodfellas. I hated 'Sunshine of Your Love' until Goodfellas, and when I hear it now I think of Jimmy Conway, smoking his cigarette, thinking, as the camera slowly zooms in.<br/><br/>A classic, Goodfellas has inspired countless films even to this day. Every part of this crime masterpiece is top- notch. If you like movies, you have to see this. 9.7/10"
"ElMaruecan82","10","2","5","22 December 2010"," The Quintessential 'Gangster' film ...
","""Goodfellas"" is so realistic you feel like watching a documentary about the mob: the narration is straight-forward, it doesn't try to use big words, or a rich vocabulary, gangsters proudly talk like the lucky scumbags they are. As for the others, the honest guys, like you and me, they are simply labeled as losers, how could someone like a script where he's almost insulted? Well, just think about this, insulted by whom? by a wannabe big shot who thinks he's the king of the world simply because he doesn't need to stand in a queue, or can get the best table to his girlfriend in the restaurant? the genius of the script is that you're almost envying the protagonists in the beginning, the whole first act has a sort of joyful atmosphere where everything is fun, even when it's not. It almost makes you drool about this life where everything is easy: money, girls, sex, fun, power, respect, when you, poor schmuck, has to struggle to live a crappier life ...<br/><br/>But they ARE criminals, no doubt about that, they're cheaters, they're robbers, murderers, they cheat their wives, they stab in the back, and the only honor they have is not to ""rat on your friends"", as if there were friends in this business anyway ... even the rules are corrupted from the beginning, why shouldn't you rat? if you're put in a position where you might do it, you're already a target ... it's a nasty, stinking, horrific world, we're proud not to belong to at the end of the film, and that's the power of the script. You follow these characters who seem cool, nice, funny (like a clown, or just like that) and you end up feeling guilty for that. The movie makes you question this weird appeal you feel to gangsters, even one of the first lines of the movie is quite significant : ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster"" ... we're like, wow! This movie goes ahead, it shouts loudly what ""The Godfather"" was trying to whisper ... from the first words of the 'Wags to Riches' song, we're literally plunged into a world, where we share the dreams of a character who wants to be a gangster, as if it was the most honorable profession. The movie doesn't even question that, it's almost normal to want to be a gangster. Scorsese has a twisted provocative approach in the beginning of the movie and it works perfectly, because it makes the ending all the more bittersweet, or all the more ironic.<br/><br/>Which takes me to the last lines, compare them with the first. The character's story arc concludes with these powerful lines : ""I'm an average nobody... get to live the rest of my life like a schnook"", this line is like a last slap in the face to the other schmucks who didn't realize during the movie that these guys were ALL already average nobodies, and probably worse than that, even when everything was fine ... the last grin on Hill's face after he did it 'his way' (a reference to the ending credits song) is to highlight the ridiculousness of the situation where he's trying to persuade himself he ever was someone before, but he was nothing ... he didn't exist in the papers, he didn't exist in society, he did nothing, and the only wise decision he took was to save his skin by 'ratting' on his 'friends'. This is a movie about ultimate losers, about a cruel, violent and nasty world where sooner or later, you LOSE. But you don't lose because crime does not pay, let's not be that naive. You lose because this so-called fellowship is based on a fallacious etiquette that makes friendship and loyalty totally inconceivable, at least in the long term. Consequently, when you watch the movie a second time, you realize that everything is fake from the beginning, the ending makes the irony even more palpable ... hell, the irony is even in the title, 'Goodfellas' ...<br/><br/>Just like its glorious predecessor, ""The Godfather"", the script is one of the most remarkable elements of the films, especially when combined with an incredible editing : you jump from a memorable scene to another, you're like watching a time capsule of the criminal world, it's an entertaining journey into crime that doesn't show how crime is fun or entertaining, but just to highlight in a more powerful way the cruelty of this world that looked so joyful, so cool in the beginning (and I don't even mention the acting)... In other words, the script is provocative, ironic and entertaining, what do you want more? better written dialogs? that's not the point. ""City Lights"" didn't need dialogs to be considered a masterpiece, nor does ""Goodfellas"" where the vocabulary is so particular, it's like another character from the film.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"", Marty's masterpiece is the quintessential Gangster film, not because it makes you want to be a gangster, but because it gives you two feelings in common with gangsters, envy and fear ... and a third one at the end, which is guilt."

","I didn't read more than a few other reviews and they were all 10 stars. I'm going to be the fly in the ointment and give it a 7, which still ain't bad. And it ain't - I mean isn't - bad at all, by any means. Nor, in my book, is it anywhere near great. Not by a long shot. It may be due, largely, although not sure yet, to Joe Pesci's one note characterization (way too typical of him). A little ""f"" word here and there never hurt nobody but goes just so far. It becomes not so much an aspect of his psychopathology but, with its over emphasis, weakens it, parodying what might be very legitimate. He was insane, and not a joke, but the character becomes jokey. How Ray Liotta did not get acknowledged for a much more realistic portrayal, and get at least a nomination for a part he brought dimensionality to, is a mystery. But, of course, the whole concept of an Academy Award is a mystery in and of itself. I mean, after all - Charlton Heston (in anything)?; Shirley Jones when you have Janet Leigh?; Rita Moreno opposite Judy Garland as well as Fay Bainter and Lotte Lenya?; not to mention the even more outrageous selection of Chakiris vs Clift and Geo. C. Scott?; Grace Kelly vs. Judy Garland????? Now, really! That one is going too far. And so on and forth. Give me Pesci in My Cousin Vinny anytime (not even a nomination). Aside from that - there were moments in the film that were clearly wonderful. Bracco and all the other molls getting their faces and nails done, scanning and re-scanning each of their thoughtless faces; the stop motion a dozen or more times capturing the characters silent, still; De Niro smiling at you with one of his 2 faces barely showing the 2nd face that will soon emerge and become the easy victor; the sense of confusion and then addiction that Liotta captures; the latter part where he describes in repetitive detail, in his drug-addled way, the order of the evening and transporting the pounds of cocaine to another city; dinner table with Mom and the 3 boys while the body in the trunk is writhing. Etc. A story told well enough in all of its pathetic realism. Scorcese is usually very good. It's this film that wasn't."
"wilkins_r","7","2","6","16 May 2005"," Reasonably fun, but overrated.
","Gangster movies are always popular; they combine the quick action of the Wild West with a certain degree of politeness and courtesy that makes the whole world seem intriguingly different to anything else you've seen. And it makes for reasonable cinema; but it's not the film many people make it out to be. It's enjoyable, and it probably will hold your attention. The fact that it's based on a true story, too, adds a little quality to it that makes it intriguing. But the character development is limited; only De Niro's character really seems to move during the film, and in that way, reality loses out to cinema fiction here. As a documentary, I think something like this would have been very fascinating. As a film, though, it seems to be lacking something somewhere down the line.<br/><br/>When all's said and done, it's a decent and enjoyable film, but there are plenty of better films out there. It's worth a watch, sure. It has some good performances, from an impressive cast - De Niro's performance is as good as you might hope or expect from him - and the film's ending is certainly memorable.

Much like Forrest Gump, its a story being told largely through one person' point of view. I conclude at the end that although the movie was exteremely enjoyable, its a bit overrated and it did not bear any lasting images in my psyche. There isn't a single aspect that strikes me as memorable or powerful. Thus it irritates me to no end that Goodfellas is constantly being compared to The Godfather, because I couldn't disagree more. What makes The Godfather so good is that its not really about gangsters running a business, but a deep look on family relationships and how their respective roles and personalities contribute to the family's successes and downfall. Goodfellas is only about three men working together, having the time of their lives, and occasionally punching and kicking their way through obstacles before things starts to fall apart at the end - nothing is out of the ordinary. The only message I get from the story is that becoming a gangster gives you power, but you must pay for that power dearly in exchange for absolute loyalty. Problem is, I've heard of this countless of times already.<br/><br/>Goodfellas has a great cast (especially Pesci), nicely paced storyline and unfortunately an average soundtrack trying hard to ""capture"" the feel of the period. I like it and its really entertaining, but at the same time its an utterly forgettable gangster movie."

","Such films have such themes and genres that excite the audience's excitement and ultimately reminds them of it.
Facing emotionally with an effect is heavily toxic to the target audience and does not know what is happening. Even after the movie finishes, it does not even name the names of any of the characters, but its excitement does not let its true sense of the film come to light.
A good comedy movie is a movie that the audience, when faced with a so-called mafia story, presents itself to the film and does not see other components of the film, and only follow the movements of the mafia.<br/><br/>Good comedy films can be seen only once, because in the second time it quickly goes through all the problems of the film and loses the value of seeing it.
Good comedy films begin with a flashback, it turns out to be claiming ""how"" it is from the beginning.
In general, the film hits the main character, which is not personality, and the same type of person plays a member of a simple mafia. He is not at all the center of the film, and his only role is to explain the story to images that they do not know and do not speak themselves.
Until the end of the movie, we do not understand how they are coming from, and they are continually being told, what they are doing is the same claim of how they do it, so that it does not happen to anyone, and it's always a storyteller. Be
As she tells the story, she wants to be a gangster and somehow into a mafia, her family is shown in a small, wildly scary plan, and after a while they are left behind. A little boy who aspires to a mafia is driven to a group by the help of the little girls and becomes a member of them. The problem with this is that there is neither a mafia nor a gangster, suddenly a court view and the victory of the boy from his first crime in his life and being official in that group, which is unclear and where is his place in the film.
The brigades are bursting and constantly stealing and murdering, there is no life in the film, and not intuition, with all these backwardness of the film, suddenly the main character succeeds in marrying his unclean future in an unknown future. . A woman who, if removed from the film, will not cause any problems.
The woman adds a bit of spiritual and religious sensation to the story, which ends in a few dialogues. A woman who does not know the mafia but is still homeless and without identity, who immediately marries a gangster who the gangster tells her is in construction, and it is not even known where in the film woman finds out what her husband really is. And how it works.
No creature is defined in the film, the music comes and goes, the camera for itself hovers around several gangsters, and when it gets tired it zooms in and out some of them.
The actors are always laughing and even teasing the mafia.
There is no good reason for the killings, nor is a specific identity defined behind them.
Suddenly, after two hours of confusion, everything is on a steep pace, and murders are carried out more quickly, the police arrest everyone and the entire dreaded band disappears.
Unfortunately, the police can not take one thing, it's a nonsense of the film, which is a free end to itself, and tells everything that it wants (even if it does not help the story).
Because of the inability of the film in its own image and later in its nursery, the end of the film ends with sentences, they come and before the title, half-story is collected so that no one understands its weaknesses.<br/><br/>The director is also looking to repeat himself. If you look at this ""Wolf of Wall Street"", you'll find that both are the same with just different stories, all the camera movements and other mecensical components are the only difference. The average age of cast is lower.
Repeating such a situation is not a sign of a signature in one work, but a sign of a kick in a particular area that the director fears to quit or try.
Good comrades do not make friends and not a good particle, all humans hate each other, and it is not clear at what time they will try to kill each other. It does not really show up as a human being in the film, and then he was looking to introduce good comrades to them.
The director does not know how to take the Mafia side and show them a little bit more colorful, and even can not destroy them and depict their actions void. Just as it comes from, it takes one side and goes.<br/><br/>rating: 0/10"

","Here we have a master filmmaker who is still finding his way. Reading the other reviews, this comment would probably be considered heresy. But Gangs of New York, Shutter Island and Wolf of Wall Street are all superior films.<br/><br/>Martin is still limited here as a director. The camera moves, but tightly bound to the characters. We get the occasional corner ceiling shot, but even the famous tracking shot through the kitchen is tightly behind Liotta. The characters drive this movie, not the camera.<br/><br/>Since the characters are driving the movie, they have to be something special. But most of them are psychotic thugs. It's amusing to watch them posture and curse, but lets face it - while you were watching this movie, did you get the feeling your life would be changed or were you just entertained for a few hours?"

","Another classic gangster flick, this is another brilliant movie which i never seem to tire of watching. As usual Joe Pesci is un-nerveingly frightening in his role and for me steals the show again, Ray Liotta is also great in this, De Niro is good but never deserves to be the number one name on any movie in my opinion, i think the only one possible for De Niro to deserve the leading name is on Cape Fear, all his roles are too similar for me and he is over-rated, but nevertheless, this is still a brilliant classic movie and De Niro is a positive overall to the movie. Another MUST SEE before you die."
"educallejero","7","1","2","29 November 2019"," Not The Godfather
","The first 15' are a masterpiece. The good use of voice over helps to create the perfect origin story for the protagonist, remembering his childhood, while naturally dropping needed exposition for the whole story to work. It's perfect.<br/><br/>But I have to be honest, that's kind of the peak of the movie. I just don't think Ray Liotta was good enough to make me enjoy the film, nor it was his character. And I know it was based on real life, but that didn't harm De Niro and Pesci, which were awesome.
And Lorraine Bracco tried but couldn't save another terrible and annoying female character ""written"" by Scorsese (with Taxi Driver, a terrible one, with The King of Comedy, an annoying one). To be fair to Scorsese, plenty of his characters are obnoxious, so I'm not sure this is sexism. And yes, the character is based in real life, so maybe, just maybe, he was being true to life to a fault. My point: why she had to have so much screen time if that's all she was (terrible character)? It wasn't really that important to the main plot.<br/><br/>Anyways. It is technically, a great movie. It tells a really complex and quite big story, with a brutality that is welcomed, and some scenes are beyond great (all of them involve Pesci and De Niro).<br/><br/>But:
He overuses the voice over (it works when the film is a character study or at least when it's only one character doing it).
The insistence on making characters annoying, actually annoyed me.
And the ambivalent performance from the lead (he works well when sentimental and really poorly otherwise), plus the unnecessary large part for ""the annoying wife"", all of them converge to create another flawed masterpiece.
Because ""Godfather"", this ain't."

"Tweekums","10","1","2","5 August 2019"," One of the great mob movies
","This film tells the story of Irish/Italian mobster Henry Hill; from the early days when he worked for mobsters as a teenager in the 1950s, through the sixties and seventies to his arrest in the eighties. We see the ease with which he slips into this world; the rewards and dangers it brings. During this time he works with fellow mobsters James Conway and the psychotic Tommy DeVito; he also marries Karen. While Henry isn't a killer he isn't unaware of the violent side of their business.<br/><br/>This is often described as the greatest mob movie; I can't say that but only because there are other very well-known mob movies that I have yet to see. The story is gripping from start to finish; there are moments of humour which frequently turn to extreme danger in the blink of an eye; this is usually due to Tommy's hair-trigger temper. The violence is usually sudden and bloody; as a character points out they don't waste time talking before they waste somebody. The cast is brilliant; Joe Pesci stands out as Tommy, it is hardly surprising that he picked up an Oscar. Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro are great as Henry and James; also particularly notable are Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill and Paul Sorvino as ""Paulie"" Cicero, the mobster Henry works for. Overall I'd say that this film is a must see for fans of the genre."

","""As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.""<br/><br/>Every single time we had to do the pointless and awkward introduction in my undergrad classes, Henry Hill's opening monologue was always my response. This achieved a couple goals for me, I avoided having to actually articulate the fact that I wanted to run for office, and I also got to see if there were any hidden cinephiles scattered around me. It never really worked; occasionally I would find another fan of the film, but never someone with a broad film taste who didn't suggest we watch Scarface as a double feature with Goodfellas. Martin Scorsese, one of the Kings of New York settled on adapting the novel by Nicholas Pileggi following the life of Henry Hill as he rose to prominence in the Brooklyn mafia. Starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas is the work of a true auteur in top form and has remained a mafia classic 27 years after its release. <br/><br/>Growing up in a modest home with blue collar parents, Henry Hill saw a way to make everything he had ever wanted his. Henry saw how the ""wiseguys' in his neighborhood lived, and wanted to be like them and have the freedom to go anywhere they wanted while wearing the best clothes and constantly having hundred dollar bills to flash. Henry started small as a child then a teenager, along with his friend Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) advancing in the mafia with each passing year. Learning the ins and outs, the rules and orders, the intricate details of the mafia--like only one could see from the inside, Henry had no problem paying his dues and earning his place. When Henry is really initiated and deemed worthy of meeting the higher ranks, he is introduced to Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). Conway, Hill, and DeVito become something of a dream team executing some of the biggest robberies and hijackings the country had ever seen. Henry's life comes crashing down when he's ""pinched"" and must take the fall for a crime. While in jail, Hill enters the drug trade making more money at less of a split than he ever had before. After his jail sentence is complete, mob boss Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) assures Henry that he will be fine in the mafia once again. He understood that Henry had to deal in drugs to keep himself and his family afloat while in prison, but he has to give that up as Paulie isn't involved in the drug trade. Living better than he ever had before, however, meant that Hill had no intentions of leaving the drug trade behind. Staying involved in drugs and becoming an addict himself got Hill into a world of trouble and the only way he can get out is by bringing about the downfall of the two people closest to him, the two he had spent nearly his whole life with, Jimmy and Tommy.<br/><br/>In an expert maneuver, Martin Scorsese begins in the middle of the story, then traces to the beginning through the end. The story structure of Goodfellas is one to marvel at, and certainly one that wouldn't have been so flawlessly executed without director Martin Scorsese. Goodfellas is so engaging that I can't tell you how many times I've seen it, and yet, if I walk into a room in which it is playing I will watch until the end. From the perfect execution of the introductory scenes, which are often a rather boring part in other films, to the brilliant in-depth character development, Goodfellas is a film to study for its narrative. An astute viewer is given such a complete glimpse into the men's lives that one can see where the character's failings exist that will eventually bring them down. Some of the best tracking shots in cinema history are contained within Goodfellas. The one fans of the film love to discuss are the scene in which Henry and his eventual wife are shown across the street as their car is getting parked and followed by the camera all the way in through the kitchen then through the front of the restaurant. It's a beautiful shot lasting two full minutes, and that's just one example of directorial prowess concerning tracking shots. My personal favorite occurs during the scene in which the audience is introduced to the mafia members. The camera slides down the length of the bar as we learn the names of those in the Brooklyn mafia as well as certain character traits they possess. One of my favorite parts of the film is the way its narration changes seamlessly between Henry and Karen Hill. We go from hearing Henry's voice then his wife's, then back to Henry's voice again all the while changing the point of view but the audience never misses a step and the narrative is never sloppy. Put simply, Goodfellas is a master class in filmmaking from a director who is no stranger to making classic films. Goodfellas on its own would be enough for any director to hang their hat on, but the fact that the same director was also behind Raging Bull and Taxi Driver speaks to the greatness of Martin Scorsese. <br/><br/>I'll never get over what happened to Tommy, though."
"jcorelis-24336","9","1","2","27 April 2017"," One of the best gangster films
","GoodFellas deserves its reputation as one of the best gangster films, and also one of the most realistic: some critics have called it a version of The Godfather without the romanticizing of the gangsters. Based on the actual autobiography of a minor player in the gang hierarchy, the film is one of Martin Scorsese's best, with several sequences of what critics have rightly called bravura film making. As expected from Scorsese, lots of language, some sex and drugs, and intense, shocking violence. But if you want a film like this, this is one you will want. In some ways the film is a trial run for the even longer and more ambitious Scorsese film Casino, which makes it interesting to see both films; personally I prefer the grittier Goodfellas. I saw it on the very good Warner Home Video Blu-Ray."
"jhnachos","10","1","2","18 March 2017"," ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster""
","Goodfellas is Crime drama that came out almost 25 years ago and it still stands as by far the best mob movie ever made.<br/><br/>The film is about of the true story of former gangster Henry Hill, who worked his up the ranks to become a big time gangster in New York in the 1960's. The film focuses on Hill working his way from a child gangster to becoming a popular gangster in the mob. The story flows very well and without any noticeable bumps in the movie. The story is easy to follow and not very confusing. The film just focuses on the ride of Henry Hill as a New York gangster, however no film is perfect, my only critique or criticism with the film is that at some point for a couple of minutes it seemed like the film dragged on with the plot. However, I barely noticed it, so it isn't that big of a deal. Henry Hill is a bad guy, but at the same time you can't help but just feel for him. In a world where gangsters spend their time murdering and stealing, Hill seems like the one who has a heart, even if it is hard to see.<br/><br/>The acting is as good as I thought it would be. Henry Hill is played Ray Liotta, and he does a really good job of portraying the young gangster, but he was overshadowed by supporting cast. Robert De Niro does a amazing job playing the veteran gangster who lives in a world surrounded by guns, money, sex and violence. He made me hate him and feel for him at many different points in the film. He carried the film nicely and kept me interested. Tommy DeVito is played by Joe Pesci and he has never been better. This is one of his best performances as a violent and humorous psycho who will make jokes and then start shooting people around him. He made me think that there is no way that anyone this crazy exists, but at the same time, he was my favorite character throughout the film. Joe Pesci fits the role perfectly. The rest of the cast is also delivers but with De Niro and Pesci performances I didn't care that much about the other performances. Goodfellas had 12 different songs, playing at 12 different points and all of the music flowed together very well. I don't think the score could've been better fit for the tone and atmosphere of the movie. During tense situations or heart pounding moments the music is always there to build the atmosphere, and make the scene in the movie seem meaningful even when it doesn't matter that much. The score just works so well with the movie and makes moments that already stand out even more intense. Few movies have the ability to create a feeling to the viewer and then double that feeling with the music that is playing. <br/><br/>The screenplay and the script is also very well done. Martin Scorsese does a great job of showing the life of Henry Hill using convincing dialogue and scenes. I loved the way events played out. It seems like the events were played out in a real life scenario. Also this movie has some of my favorite quotes and scenes I have ever seen in a movie. Nothing in this movie is predictable or clichÃ© at any point of the film. Whenever something important happened it wasn't predictable, and at some points of the film, I was caught off guard completely. The dialogue also made every scene seem meaningful even when it didn't affect the plot of the film or change the characters in a major or dramatic way. When a scene was full of suspense, the dialogue made all of it full of anticipation and gripped me in a very memorizing way. I may be talking about the dialogue a lot, but it did help the film a lot by building the situations and making every scene have deeper meaning. The dialogue was my favorite part of the film.<br/><br/>The overall theme is forgiveness and if the main character can live with himself with all of the brutal things he does to other people. I couldn't think of a better way to show this theme by taking the true story of a gangster and bringing back to life. With great acting, a well made script, convincing dialogue, an amazing atmosphere and compelling story make Goodfellas one of the best movies of all time. If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you do, this is the best mob movie ever made."

","To see an artist working at the peak of his power, everything extraneous stripped away, every element there for a purpose, is an extraordinary exhilaration.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese gave us that pure, hot, unquestioned power last in ""Raging Bull"" and, in virtuosity alone, ""GoodFellas"" is ""Raging Bull"" squared. (It opens Friday at selected theaters.)<br/><br/>Scorsese has hardly been marking time in the 10 years between the two; ""After Hours"" and his ""Life Lessons"" segment of ""New York Stories"" showed just how much he has matured, grown more intelligently ironic and is even more astonishingly in command of his craft. ""GoodFellas,"" which somehow mixes its horrors with a deep vein of mordant humor, flows with the exuberance of a filmmaker who has every detail nailed and a few new lovely moves he wants to show us.<br/><br/>His characters--a savage quartet that includes Robert DeNiro, a truly chilling Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino and Ray Liotta--are the same ones he has been considering since ""Mean Streets"": the wise guys of his neighborhood, different from us in that pity seems to have been left out of their DNA and an off-handed brutality slipped into its place.<br/><br/>Obviously, this is Coppola's and Puzo's turf, too, but Coppola's grandiose characters, rubbing shoulders with senators and popes, are like figures from grand opera. Scorsese's gangsters, his wise guys, are pure street level, they're the stuff of popular song that Scorsese threads through his picture--Tony Bennett, Bobby Vinton, the Crystals.<br/><br/>""GoodFellas' "" no-nonsense street tone comes straight from journalist Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wise Guy,"" a shrewd distillation of 30 years in the Mafia through the eyes of one of its sidewalk mechanics. Half-Sicilian, half-Irish Henry Hill (Liotta) began by running nimbly for the wise guys at the corner cabstand when he was 12; 30 years later, when it became clear that it was either them or him, he turned on them with exactly the same agility."

Sorvino etc. and those bit players - jeez this film has the best bit players ever.<br/><br/>And a new direction for Scorsese visually and in terms of editing. This was probably the film that commenced the sensory overload thing. He continued this with Cape Fear, took it to another level with Casino and then went crazy with it in Wolf Of Wall Street.<br/><br/>The ""funny how"" scene was brilliant. Yes. It was so perfectly rendered. Not just Pesci and Liotta. But the people sitting next to them - it is amazing how their reactions change from drunken glee to utter discomfort.<br/><br/>It does glorify gangster life to a certain extent, for a good part of the film. Of course the ending and Henry Hill's family life are like warnings. I guess the film is so damn entertaining and stylish, you tend to overlook the fact that it also a cautionary tale.<br/><br/>After multiple viewings, I think the first half of the film is exaggerated but well made and entertaining nonetheless. But it is the second half when Hill and Karen's marriage begin to unravel that I really liked. Lorraine Bracco is on another level. What an actress.<br/><br/>And after watching Goodfellas and Casino, how can a person take Di Caprio, Ryan Gosling, Tom Hardy etc seriously as gangsters or even leading men? <br/><br/>Its just been made and edited with so much love.

In the film Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta, grows up in a rough part of Brownsville, Brooklyn; where he drops out of high school and finds himself under the wing of Paul Cicero, played by Paul Sorvino. Right before the climax of the film Jimmy Conway, majestically played by Robert De Niro, introduces Hill to Tommy DeVito, played by no other than Joe Pesci, this holy trinity of gangsters pull of some of the most superb heists that Brooklyn has ever seen. Shortly after the heists is where everything starts to go south for Henry, while Henry is fine where he is on the totem poll his two partners in crime are not. A series of unpleasant events unfold that end up ruining Henry's relationship with the mob and puts his life in danger. The script is absolutely fabulous as it makes you pick a side Henry and his partners or the mob."
"Leofwine_draca","10","1","2","24 July 2016"," Scorsese's masterpiece stands the test of time
","Martin Scorsese's unflinching portrayal of life in the mafia is a rightly acclaimed epic, at times funny, depressing but most of all frightening, all the more so because it's based on a true story. Basically it's the story of Ray Liotta's character's rise and fall in the mafia, and the way his relationships change with the various figures there as times come and go.<br/><br/>The acting is what makes this film so engaging, and Ray Liotta excels as the bright young man who eventually becomes a drug addict. His transformation is brilliant as he ages thirty years and the acting choice couldn't have been better. Robert De Niro is on hand to deliver some real class to the proceedings too, and he's as good as he ever was as the seemingly nice but deadly Jimmy. However Joe Pesci steals the overacting awards with his portrayal of the foul-mouthed psychotic Tommy, who spends the film shooting and beating those who offend him. Pesci is both funny and frightening as a maniac who doesn't think twice about killing people, and his kinetic performance bursts off the screen in a blaze of fury. The rest of the cast, including Liotta's wife and Paul Sorvino, also put in well-judged and realistic performances.<br/><br/>While some people may be put off by the long running length, this is engrossing viewing, as the film charts the various gruesome demises of unfortunate characters (the opening body in the boot being a standout in sheer brutality), Liotta's growing paranoia (the helicopter scenes are memorable) and eventual capture, and the characters' changing loyalties. GOODFELLAS was really the final word about gangster life, at least until CASINO came along."

","When I was younger I couldn't decide which one of these classics is the best film about gangsters ever made. The Godfather or Goodfellas. As I grow up, though I acknowledge the Godfather to be a masterpiece, Goodfellas is definitely my favorite one. I can't find a flaw in this film no matter how hard I try. The story is powerful, exciting, emotional and thrilling. All that without being complicated and without having to remember 100 character's names and situations. The direction by Scorsese is excellent. I can't say much about it, none other than that it's one his best films. I love the narration, I love the acting, I love the film's music. It's one of those films that I loved every minute watching it, have watched it 10 times but never got bored by it. If you love gangster films you probably have watched too, if not, go watch it now!"
"djstuurman","10","1","2","16 October 2015"," It is a creative and incredible take on a era of glamorized crime.
","This movie has insatiable action, from the get-go, and puts the viewer in the front seat with the characters. The movie is well narrated by the main character, as it's his actual experiences within La Cosa Nostra. Even though the Italian mafia at the time was feared and immensely powerful, this film shows the psychology of the characters, and it displays all facets of their lives. We usually only receive one perspective; however this film shows off the relationships of Henry Hill from all aspects. It starts when he was a young boy, and with a surname like Hill, one wonders how he could be part of an underground Italian organization? These are the details the movie focuses on, the finer specifics, it's not all gun blazing and assassinations. I'd advise this flick, because it exhibits the interactions, relationships, hardships, choices, struggles of an individual rising through the ranks of a crime family."

","Let me start off by saying: I love Martin Scorsese's work, as far as I saw 3 movies from him: Shutter Island, Wolf of Wall Street and The Departed. All were awesomely directed, as well as acted. I decided to watch Goodfellas, since I want to see all the classics, like I did with the great Pulp Fiction and I could go on...<br/><br/>Hands down, one of the best acting and storytelling I have ever seen. It's full of tasty dialogues, quotes, from awesome characters, fantastic costumes and all with great music. The ""Intro Scene"" is from the middle of the movie, where a man is getting killed in a car by Henry and his two mob friends, does it's justice: it pulls you in on this fantastic journey with so many great scenes, and the shocking ones (like Tommy's head shot scene) too. 9/10-very very close to the perfect 10"

Many may argue which Scorsese movie is the best (for me it will always be TD).<br/><br/>I have always loved the crime genre, and the drama, both of does makes excellent crime drama - which is in my opinion the best movie genre ever because I love it so much. This movie takes that genre into a much, much more gritty and dark direction which I haven't quite seen. You talk about Godfather, it may be dark in many aspects, but nowhere is it as close as Goodfellas when it comes to grittiness. <br/><br/>This movie tells the biographical life of former mobster Henry Hill during his life from the later 50's into the early 1980's, in such a great fashion from brilliant movie director Martin Scorsese. I feel as if Henry Hill has a radical transformation, and how his life as a mobster changes so fast. Ray Liotta gives a breath taking performance. And what can I say about Bob De Niro that hasn't already been said, he is always great and this movie is one of his later success in his career before he went goodbye as an amazing actor. Joe Pesci? He is such a brilliant actor, and this movie showed his brilliance in acting so much. With this, all I can say about Goodfellas is this - ''As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.''"

The directing, acting, settings, soundtrack, story and dialogue been that good that I thought it actually happened.

","""Good fellas"" is a true story about Robert De Niro who plays ""Henry Hill,"" a small time gangster in New York City who works his way to higher power of the mob. The movie takes places around the time frame of 1955 to 1980 in New York City. The film is based on the book, ""Wise Guy"" published in 1986 by Nicholas Pileggi. Produced by, Warner Bros, the film won one Oscar award for Best actor in supporting role by actor Joe Pecsi. It was also followed by winning 41 awards along with 23 nominations. The movie grossed at $46.8 million with a budget of $25 Mil. Henry Hill takes action in a robbery, where his two associates Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito begin to kill everyone who took part in the robbery. Henry hill is affected very negatively by the actions of his fellow mobsters and will do everything in his power to bring them down. My Favorite part of the movie is when Robert De Niro begins the movie with the words said by Henry Hill himself, ""For as long as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster. To me that was better than being president of the United States. To be a gangster was to own the world."" The movie condones a lot of violence, drugs, and sex but never one time does the main character turn his back on his dream of becoming a gangster."

This film is one of Scorsese's masterpieces. It has the originality of ""White Heat"" and realism in a category all its own.

There is no more iconic performance than Joe Pesci. ""What do you mean I'm funny?"" Robert De Niro is only the third most outrageous performer.

","Ever since The Godfather first premiered way back in 1972, I find it quite the challenge to call any subsequent gangster film a great one. Not only do such films need to have a really gripping and remarkable story. these films should be orchestrated by a director who has enough knowledge of this crime sub-genre and is able to deftly juggle all of the filmmaking elements to create a truly fascinating motion picture. Goodfellas is such a film. It is a movie that I have a deep affection for. An affection that only increases after every viewing. Goodfellas is one of the best films you will ever see. It is a rich and expansive motion picture that grabs your attention from the very first scene and never lets go. There have been so many films since The Godfather that have tried, and failed, to give us another gangster movie to remember. A few have succeeded, with Goodfellas being one of them. With the distinguished acting talents of Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, along with the masterful direction of Martin Scorsese, this is a really unique gangster film. Whenever I am about to watch Goodfellas, I always get the feeling that I am on the verge of experiencing something grand and exquisite, a characteristic of any great film. Simply put, Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is an enduring classic for the ages. I'm gonna give THE GOODFELLAS a 10\10 stars."
"bkrauser-81-311064","9","1","2","27 October 2013"," Scorsese's Ultimate Triumph
","There was a time in my youth when I really didn't appreciate gangster movies. Maybe it was because of the way I was raised or the amount of estrogen present in my mothers womb due to birth order but I never saw the intense violence of that lifestyle as anything but a cry for help. It wasn't until watching Martin Scorsese's The Departed (2006) that my notions of true- to-life crime dramas began to change. I then went back to watch Goodfellas (1990), a film I originally saw bits and pieces of when I was twelve.<br/><br/>Today Goodfellas remains to me a revelation. An honest portrayal of the Mafioso lifestyle told directly from the horses mouth.The movie itself takes the viewer through three decades of mob life. Our protagonist Henry becomes enamored with the lifestyle in early adolescence and is hooked with its excesses before costars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci even appear on screen. Once they do, the trio become the focus of the film as they attempt to climb up the Lucchese family hierarchy. Ray Liotta serves as our narrator and double for real-life wiseguy Henry Hill a half Irish-Italian mobster turned informant who spilled the beans on the Lucchese crime family for the FBI and later writer Nicholas Pileggi. Pileggi would later release his book Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family in 1986 which is around the time director Martin Scorsese got wind of the story.<br/><br/>The film is told through a series of episodes starting with the three protagonists driving in darkness and killing an unknown man in the trunk of their car. The film then linearly progresses through time, revisiting that gruesome scene halfway through. While the story structure diverges slightly from the traditionally linear, anticipating action, climax, resolution format, the movie keeps interest. This is to the credit of Martin Scorsese's direction as well as his habit of putting bubbly 50's and 60's pop songs over brutal acts of violence. Nicholas Pileggi should also take a bow both for the original book and countless rewrites that made Goodfellas possible. It was his authenticity that brought the characters dimension.<br/><br/>but while the writer gives characters motivations and plot, it is the actors that really make them flesh and blood. Robert De Niro's Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway towers in every scene he's in with equal parts suavity and malice. While De Niro provides the group credibility in the yes of the mob and audience, Joe Pesci is pure id. A trigger-happy sociopath with a red hot temper and a gun; not a combination that leads to good things in a movie of this kind. Pesci would end up winning an Oscar for his work on Goodfellas; a role that was originally offered to Al Pacino.<br/><br/>One underrated aspect of Goodfellas is the character arch of Lorraine Bracco's role Karen Hill; Henry's wife. There are moments of the film narrated by the tragic heroine that provide the movie with a sense of perspective just as Henry's objectivity has gone off the deep end. She's an outsider who is at first overwhelmed but becomes seduced by the decadence of mob life and breaks bad. I would argue that the river runs deeper with Karen than with the dejected Henry. Henry wants the fancy cars, excessive Staten Island home and the most expensive artificial Christmas tree money can buy. But when Karen is handed a gun and told to hide it, right after a aberrant neighbor gets his faced smashed with the butt-end, she claims arousal. This is not a woman who craves simple security in the arms of the hero, she wants respect. That's why every transgression Henry or anyone makes is met with hostility. What isn't shown in the movie but detailed in the book was Karen's affair with mob capo Paul Vario while Henry was in prison; little more Lady MacBeth than Ophelia if you ask me.<br/><br/>Of course, Goodfellas as a whole is studded with set pieces of violence and cruelty that in a lesser movie I wouldn't be impressed with. But as with good food, its not just ingredients that make the meal, its how its presented. The violence of Goodfellas is presented with a matter- of-factness and purpose that isn't gratuitous. Scorsese doesn't want you to bask in the glory of outright gore, he wants you to experience the world as the characters do, a task which he largely succeeds in.<br/><br/>I love this movie if for no other reason than it breaks the mold and sets a gold-standard for other genre movies to inspire to. It features topnotch performances from actors and actresses at the top of their game, and it showcases the uncompromising vision and talent of one of the greatest auteurs of the late 20th century.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

You're missing out. Robert De Nero and Joe Pesci are at their absolute best in this. When I recommend a movie to someone that has either of those guys, THIS is the movie I always say first.<br/><br/>However, it should be noted that a performance in this that people underrate is Ray Liotta's. He's fantastic as Henry Hill and he is way more interesting than the real life Henry Hill (who has been accused to have lied about and embellished his mafia stories).<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese has never done a better movie than this.<br/><br/>So if you haven't seen this, THEN GO SEE IT!"

","Goodfellas was a great movie and one of the most popular gangster movies of all time. Being that its based on a true story, it shows the ups and downs of life in the Italian mafia. The film makes great use of cinematography such as with the camera work. The musical selection also goes well with the corresponding scenes. The director, Martin Scorsese, use great directing techniques to get the best out of his actors and actresses. The character development is is also set up really well taking you through the best of times in the mafia and the worst of times. The script probably stands out the most, being that the movie was based off of a book. So all the stories are true and all his fellow gangsters were actually based off of real life characters. The acting might have been some of the best that I had seen in a gangster film with Ray Liotta playing the main character perfectly but the actor whose role stood out the most was Joe Pesci. He even went on to win an Oscar for best supporting actor for that role. There were few objections to the movie but many people felt that the language used was too vulgar. I think it just better help explain just the type of lifestyle that these guys were living. Some also believed that the movie should have received an NC-17 rating but it was barely able to squeak by with a R rating. Being a huge fan of the film I would definitely have to recommend it to whoever likes gangster genres."

Joe Pesci outshines among the performers followed by brilliant Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. As for Robert De Niro, he wasn't used to his full potential and felt unneeded in this film. Period.

","Brilliance. This film reeks of brilliance. From the direction, to the screenplay, to the cast. Everything in this film is flawless. But, I shall go into more detail to explain this film's brilliance.<br/><br/>Mobster films are one of my favorite film genres, and I am sure many people share that same liking. They always produce a weird sense of suspense, intrigue, and mystification. The Godfather emblazoned the mobster genre, marking a true cinematic farce and a very good milestone in film making. After the Godfather, many people tried out their hands on mobster films, but none equaled the impact and quality of the Godfather until Scorsese made Goodfellas. Goodfellas biggest quality is that it is based on a true story. This makes the film even more interesting and likable, seeing as most of the events portrayed really happened. The story of Henry Hill was a perfect foreground.<br/><br/>On the acting side of things, there is nothing to really to complain about. The actors gave powerhouse performances, particularly Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci really gives a genuinely terrifying yet hilarious character performance. He is truly believable and ultimately ruthless. Liotta is spectacular. No more to add to that. he really showed the world that he could truly act when he did this movie. As for Robert DeNiro, he shines in every scene he is in, but my only quibble is the fact we didn't get to see more of his character. He seemed interesting, but we didn't really get any insight. Lorraine Bracco has an annoying voice, but she does give a great, passionate and sympathetic performance as Liotta's wife.<br/><br/>The direction by Scorsese is flawless. his choices were brilliant. he really gives a documentary style of direction, as if we are there observing the everyday life of the mafia. His fade outs are poignant, and his choices for the background music are a plus.<br/><br/>As a whole, Goodfellas gives a great insight into the mafia. It throws away the stereotypes we usually associate with those who are in the mafia, and it really has an impact. With terrific actors,top notch direction, an excellent, precise screenplay, and a great story, what is there not to like about this film? I highly recommend this film to everyone, and it should become a part of your movie library IMMEDIATELY."

","Goodfellas is my second favourite all time film. Just after Scarface. This film is just absolutely brilliant. I originally watched Goodfellas back in the late 90s when my dad had an old VHS of it. I fell in love with the film right there and then. I didn't get the DVD until by birthday in 2010. Unfortunately, it was the annoying double sided disc. You get the first 70 minutes of the film on one side, and the last 70 minutes on the other. This means you have to flip the disc over half way through which is really irritating. You half to take the disc out, turn it around and then put it back in just after the sequence where Tommy kills Spider. I haven't got the 2 disc edition yet, but I really want it. The film was inspired by true story and is also based on the book Wiseguys by Nicholas Pileggi. He co wrote the script with the director of this masterpiece Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta gives his greatest performance in this film as the lead character Henry Hill. He is just absolutely brilliant. The sequence where he has to break the wall at the end of the film and talk to the camera was just brilliant. Robert De Niro gives one amazing performance as well as the infamous gangster Jimmy Conway. However, it is Joe Pesci who steals this movie. He is just absolutely terrifying as Tommy DeVito. Definitely someone you don't want to mess with. The way he just shoots Spider in the foot and later on kills him was scary. This is because he just acts like there is nothing wrong with his actions. Joe Pesci won a rightly deserved academy award for this film. I think he does just as good, if not even better as Nicky Santoro in another Martin Scorsese masterpiece Casino.<br/><br/>Lorraine Bracco gives a great performance in this film as well as Karen Hill. She scares the hell out of me every time she shouts. Another amazing actor in this film is Paul Sorvino who plays Paul Cicero (Paulie). There are several scenes of brutal violence in this film but don't worry its nothing to disturbing. The sequence where Henry bashes the face in of a man who tried to rape his wife is sick. Another shocking sequence is when Tommy and Jimmy beat the living hell out of Billy Batts who is played very well by Frank Vincent.<br/><br/>Goodfellas stands the test of time as being one of the greatest films ever made. If you are going to purchase the DVD then get the full 2 disc edition. I heard you get two audio commentaries and several documentaries. The choices of the music in this film is absolutely brilliant. It truly is the second greatest film ever made. (P.S. the film also contains around 300 F words).<br/><br/>BBFC consumer advice: Rated 18 for strong language, bloody violence and hard drug use."

It stars a bang up cast of world class actors, ray liotta, joe pesci, robert deniro, paul sorvino and the list goes on and on. It was written and dircted by Martin Scorscese who is considered by many to be the best film maker of all time.<br/><br/>This movie follows the true story of Henry Hill (Liotta) a young man who started working for the mob when he was just a teenager. The movie gives a very detailed view of his life and all the trouble he faced through out it.<br/><br/>This is easily Ray Liottas finest hour and this movie is the reason he even got into Hollywood. Also it has a bang up performances from Robert deniro and joe pesci. Mob movies would not be the same without those two in them. This movie all comes together perfectly made possible by the fantastic writing of Scorsese and the immaculate acting of all those involved. I highly recommend this to everyone hands down the best mafia film ever made"
"Red-Barracuda","10","1","2","22 April 2011"," A definitive gangster film
","Goodfellas is a pretty mesmerizing film. Martin Scorsese at his best is an incredibly dynamic director and Goodfellas is most certainly one of his greatest achievements. For a film that clocks in at two and a half hours it sure moves at a fast pace. This is a movie that never lags. There is no waste. It's a master-class in how to keep an audience glued to a screen.<br/><br/>It documents the story of Henry Hill the real life gangster. Like the 30's gangster films it's a rise and fall epic, but unlike these the resolution is a lot more ambiguous and the overall presentation is considerably more complex. I'm not sure how close the film is to actual events, but I do realize that some principal characters have had their names changed for some reason. Ultimately, the level of actual authenticity doesn't matter very much as this is a superlative film either way.<br/><br/>Scorsese has never been afraid to go to extremes. This film like many of his others is very raw. Language and violence are strong; the latter, very much so in the murder of the character Billy Batts. The brutality adds an undeniable visceral appeal to the film. Yet it does still seem entirely justifiable within the context of the story. Acting is universally top drawer with everybody giving terrific performances. Although special mention does have to go to Joe Pesci whose character Tommy is seriously unforgettable. Tommy is a pint-sized sociopath with a pretty monumental chip on his shoulder. Most film-makers would never have recognized that an actor as small as Pesci would be ideal for the role of this character. But Pesci's size and high-pitched voice only add to his menace somehow, it's as if these defects of his character make Tommy even more at war with the world and make him an even more bitter and dangerous guy. Scorsese's trademark use of popular music is excellently incorporated into the film. The tunes by turns indicate the time period, parallel the events and add an ironic backdrop to proceedings. It's a textbook example of how to compose a soundtrack with contemporary music but in a way that adds depth and meaning.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Goodfellas is arguably the best gangster film out there. As a piece of cinema, it is thrilling. Recommended unreservedly."

","The gangster movie has gone through a lot of changes, especially since being reinvented as high drama with The Godfather pictures in the 1970s. Such classics soon become clichés and in the 80s gangster movies were often spoofs (Prizzi's Honor, Married to the Mob). Goodfellas opened a new chapter of serious yet very stylish crime flicks.<br/><br/>Goodfellas was, back then, a comparative rarity in the genre in that it is based on a true story. And storywise it is as a much a documentary as it is a good yarn. Most scenes, when considered individually are simply revelations of gangster life, and the almost constant narration more or less acknowledges this. It's only when viewed as a whole that an entire story arc starts to emerge. But there is also continual structure in the arrangement of each little anecdote. Take for example the pair of scenes in the bar with ""Spider"". These go together, but you need to know that some time has passed in between them. Writers Nicholas Pilleggi and Martin Scorsese throw in a quick in-between-scene of Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco arguing. This demonstrates that other events have gone on in the meantime, but also keeps the tense, gritty atmosphere riding along. The vibrant language and frequent diversions into wisecracking make this a forerunner to the dialogue-for-the-sake-of-dialogue school of screen writing which Quentin Tarantino would soon specialise in.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's direction closely follows the narration, both in its content and its snappy pace. Like Hitchcock his camera is constantly roving around, leading us by the hand and making us look at things. In effect he's illustrating Henry Hill's words. And often he's showing a little more than that. Sometimes there's a cheeky counterpoint between words and images. There are also some clever pull-back-and-reveal shots. In one early shot we see a close-up of some liquor changing hands. The camera pulls out to show that the booze is being used to bribe a couple of cops. We are continually bombarded with ideas, continually pushed and pulled through the narrative. Of course, a lot of Scorsese's technical business here – the zooms, jump cuts and lengthy tracking shots are just cinematic wheelies, and headache-inducing ones at that. But so long as you can put up with them you have to admire the rhythmic precision with which the whole thing has been put together.<br/><br/>There is however another downside to the overtly technical style at work here. We don't really get to see the performances at their best. Poor old Ray Liotta probably did the best work of his life here, but it's all chopped up in little bits, and all we get is occasional looks, flashes, half-gestures. The same goes for Lorraine Bracco. Robert De Niro apparently did extensive research into his character, but there doesn't seem to have been much point since he is more or less the same as all the other Italian American gangsters he has played in his career. The only player who really comes out well here is Joe Pesci. Pesci has such charisma and presence that he commands attention even in small doses. It also helps that his style is very much in tune with the punchy dialogue and staccato rhythm of the whole piece.<br/><br/>Coming from the peak in Scorsese's abilities as a director of tight control over every aspect, Goodfellas could easily have fallen into the trap of being nothing but a showy technical exercise. The only thing that saves it is the fact that its subject matter is so interesting. Old and established as the gangster movie is, this one reveals so many sordid truths and fascinating facts about that lifestyle, and does so in such a direct, never-a-dull-moment manner, that it gives the whole genre a jolting jump-start."

","This is a perfect movie.<br/><br/>It all came together for Scorsese, a true magician of cinema.<br/><br/>After brilliant films such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, the acting performances, soundtrack, suspense, comedy, violence, setting, were all interwoven to a tee.<br/><br/>Liotta must deserve credit, carrying the film the whole way. But there were also mentionable acting performances from his wife (Karen), Mori, and Pauli Cicero.<br/><br/>De Niro in my opinion is one of the greatest actors in cinematic history, and Joe Pesci you can't go wrong with in any movie centered around violence/the mafia/blood/humour.<br/><br/>10/10 A must watch for ANYONE."

","Before seeing Goodfellas, I knew knew very little of the crime genre, or biopic films for that matter. When I first saw it a few years ago, I was quite frankly, blown away. Everything from the way Martin Scorsese used the wonderful soundtrack, how he used specific songs in specific scenes to increase the mood (especially the Billy Batts scene, when he is being beat to death, the Song ""Atlantis"" by ""Donovan"" can be heard playing, which means he will be ""sleeping with the fishes""), to the acting, which in my opinion, is the most real and raw i've ever seen in a film. There is seriously not a single bad performance in this movie, and Joe Pesci is incredible, the way his character (which is based on a real mobster, mind you) goes from being a joker, to being dead serious in seconds. The writing in the Goodfellas is also very solid, having a great script along with a great cast to act it out is a good combination, and this film just so happens to have that.<br/><br/>the Fact that it's 17 on the top 250, and that the Dark Knight is higher just sickens me. The Dark Knight is a good movie, but watch it and then watch Goodfellas, and it's clear that Goodfellas is FAR superior along with most of the films above it."

If you have not seen this yet make sure you see it soon you wont be disappointed. Joe Pesci is fantastic in his Oscar winning role as Tommy Devito. But the best acting in the movie was done by then newcomer Ray Liotta. His narration and the way he delivers his lines is great. This movie was nominated for best picture but was beat by Dances with Wolves which was great but did not deserve the Oscar. This movie is a classic and should be a required viewing for any gangster movie fan. Make sure you see this outstanding classic of a mob movie. A masterpiece."

","Director Martin Scorsese has a specialty when it comes to doing movies. His true specialty is mob movies. Goodfella, though most people call it his best, isn't my favorite of his. But it is a great film, filled with great performances, and many memorable things about it. <br/><br/>Goodfellas is the true story of Henry Hill(played by Ray Liotta)and how he brings himself up to the higher mob levels. Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro plays some wise guys too. The film also shows his marriage and how it falls down.<br/><br/>Scorsese is a master with mob movies. I mean this is the man who did Casino, The Departed, Gangs of New York, and I think there are others. Maybe i'm wrong. Casino was my favorite of his films. But Goodfellas is a great film too.<br/><br/>Goodfellas was nominated for Best picture. It probably should've won. Though I can't remember what else came out that year. The performance by Joe Pesci and whoever plays Liotta's wife are terrific. <br/><br/>Goodfellas is very interesting, and real. My family is Italian, so I also find this movie to be believable. Trust me, we're not in the mob. Though everyone thinks my dad is. Goodfellas is almost the greatest mob movie ever made. But barely doesn't make it. Still a great film though.<br/><br/>Goodfellas: A+"
"jzappa","10","1","2","8 June 2010"," This Movie Is A Drug.
","In the opening moments of GoodFellas, a movie about the tradecraft and culture of organized crime in New York, our storyteller Henry Hill says that for as long as he can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster, that it was better than being President. That he voice-overs his own life, later joined by his wife, narrating her side, is pivotal to the movie's ingenuity. Though the film refuses to judge its characters, it's not an omniscient portrayal, but a frame of reference rooted in yearning for the life. What's more, alternating dual narration causes us to see scenes in different ways. ""These were blue-collar guys,"" Hill's wife rationalizes. ""The only way they could make real extra money was to go out and cut a few corners."" Their influence was, and is, exhilarating. ""If we wanted something, we just took it,"" Henry says. ""If anyone complained twice they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again."" After all of his harrowing experiences, Henry, played by Ray Liotta in the stand-out performance of his career, still carps, still misses all the good times. And after literally having seen this film possibly a hundred or more times, I still watch.<br/><br/>The screenplay is both based on Nicholas Pileggi's biography of Hill, and Scorsese's own Little Italy recollections. The early scenes showcase adolescent Henry as an errand boy for the local Brooklyn mob. A shot of him peering out his tenement window reflects Scorsese's own schoolday reminiscences of the neighborhood. So does the reverse-shot which utilizes quiet slow-motion for closeups of mobsters' shiny shoes, slick ties, greased-back hair, ostentatious rings, smoldering cigars. In a movie legendary for violence that happens by surprise, one of the most jolting kicks comes when Henry's beaten by his father for missing school. He had to ""take a few beatings"" at home owing to his teenage professional pursuit, but it was a small price. Violence is like the tempo beneath every scene. The percussion is the fruits of unwarranted benefits. Henry's accomplice Jimmy Conway emerges into his first shot with Robert De Niro's special brand of broadcasted constraint. His mannerisms say, ""Don't worry. You'll all get autographs if you're patient."" Henry's other partner is the unforgettable Tommy DeVito, in an extraordinary performance by Joe Pesci, who oversteps his influence rather than letting it imply itself.<br/><br/>Henry's enthusiasm for his developing profession is tangible. In the movie's most talked-about shot, he takes his future wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco gives it her all) to the Copacabana. There's a line in front, but he squires her across the street, downstairs through service hallways, the kitchen area, out into the showroom right as their table's being set right in front of the stage. This uninterrupted three-minute shot is not just a cameraman's feat: It's a bold technique showing how the whole world appears to unravel readily before young Henry Hill. There's another particularly extended shot, as Henry acquaints us with his fellow gangsters. Henry leads the camera through a packed speakeasy, calling out names as the characters nod to the camera, mutter to Henry. The camera appears to track Henry, yet appears to be his POV; sometimes he's talking to them, sometimes to us. We're included in the scene. The cinematographer, Michael Ballhaus, was a central accomplice. Cultivating Scorsese's trademark form, he quite rarely lets his camera be stationary. It's so often in motion, if just slightly, making us not cold bystanders but complicit witnesses.<br/><br/>Alongside the violence is an account of capitalistic striving. Henry and Karen come from circumstances that couldn't freely result in Cadillacs, Vegas excursions, fur coats. She rationalizes what he has to do to finance their prestige. The movie centralizes Henry's climb through the mob, then down into prison sentences and full-blown duplicity. Initially the mob looks to be an augmentation of his life, then eventually, after he begins selling drugs, there's a hemmed-in diminishing. The camera style in the earlier scenes ritualizes his network of control with all-encompassing grace. Near the end, in an intoxicatingly berserk segment huddled in one day, the form gets hectic and jerky as he hustles frenziedly around the neighborhood on family and criminal errands while a helicopter constantly feels like it's fluttering above. This is one of the most virtuoso film sequences I have ever seen.<br/><br/>What Scorsese does that makes GoodFellas so universally adored is infect us with his exhilaration with the material. It has the breakneck propulsion of a storyteller who can't wait to see your reaction. Scorsese's camera embraces these guys, listens to their shoes clicking, beholds the tailoring of their clothes. And when they're plotting the fabled Lufthansa job, he has them whispering together in a tight three-shot that has their heads bent low and close with the rush of their own awesomeness. What a rush it is for them to steal.<br/><br/>The film's way is to sever dialogue with brutality. We see some of cinema's most effective cries wolf, as in Pesci's legendary restaurant scene where Tommy would like to know what Henry meant when he said he was a funny guy. Other instants amplify abruptly out of the sheer mob environment: The way a mistaken drink order leads to blood. The way kidding around in a bar leads to a man being viciously brutalized. The way the violence bayonets the everyday lives of the characters is invariably enforced. Tommy, Henry and Jimmy, with a body in their trunk, stop at Tommy's mother's house to get a knife, and she insists they sit down at 3 a.m. for spaghetti. Scorsese feels so in control of his powerful talent here. It describes crime's allure for an insatiable young man who's determined from childhood beatings not to resent power, but long for it. When Henry talks to us at the beginning, it sounds like a classic Hollywood dream-come-true picture."
"jcc586","10","1","2","20 May 2010"," Film-making at its finest.
","Martin Scorsese is hailed by many as the greatest living American filmmaker, but with the passing of Swedish master auteur Ingmar Bergman in 2007, I would argue that Scorsese is the greatest living filmmaker in the world. ""Goodfellas"" is a perfect example of the brilliance of Scorsese, as he takes his audience inside a world that is often misunderstood by the general population.<br/><br/>The film feels unbelievably authentic, not just because it's based on actual events, but because Scorsese understands this world as well as any filmmaker ever could. Growing up on the streets of Manhattan's Lower East Side, Scorsese had plenty of exposure to the violent world of the ""Mafia."" Scorsese understands better than anyone the destructive nature of the ""mafia"" lifestyle, but he also understands how appealing it can be. That is what makes ""Goodfellas"" such an incredibly powerful film, the fact that the characters are not portrayed as one-dimensional villains, but are presented as ordinary men who have been seduced by the lifestyle from an early age.<br/><br/>Scorsese does a masterful job of creating a world where death seems like an inevitability. The famous ""Funny Guy"" scene is one of the most powerful scenes in movie history because it so effectively captures the volatility of the mafia lifestyle. The truth is, your best friend one day, can become your worst enemy the next. Nothing gets in the way of business, and as a result, friendships are of secondary importance. No filmmaker is better at probing the psyches of violent men than Scorsese. He burrows into the world of the mafia and doesn't attempt to sugarcoat it, which results in a film that is incredibly violent and profane, but never gratuitous.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" is not only a masterpiece and one of the greatest films of the 1990s, but it is further proof that Martin Scorsese is a filmmaker of incomparable talent."
"Samiam3","10","1","2","15 May 2010"," Unparalled Gangster movie
","No matter how many times you watch it, Goodfellas is one of those movies which you just never grow out of. Arguably the best gangster film of the decade (but I think of all time). Martin Scorsese is able to generate just about every kind of tone a film could have; humorous, touching, depressing, grim. This is superbly written and acted, and ten times more down-to-Earth and involving than the Godfather. If there is anyone out there who hasn't seen Goodfellas.....see it.<br/><br/>The first thing we see on screen are the words 'The following is based on a true story' or something like that. In the twenty first century, those words are the hottest marketing gig going. Goodfellas was before those days. Next we meet Henry Hill, who became a gangster at grade school age, and went on to become hot stuff. He helped pull off the famous Lufthansa heist, but did he and his buddies get away with it? <br/><br/>Goodfellas is able to cover about three and a half decades in two hours, without felling too slow or too fast. The story, is direct and detailed, and allows the viewer to become 'one of the boys'. Goodfellas feels like a party almost, with an occasional ballroom brawl here and there.<br/><br/>I'm assuming because of its Oscar snub, that the film wasn't very popular when it was released, but of course brilliance doesn't come right away. It took years for the world to recognize just how groundbreaking Citizen Kane was. No movie is perfect, but Goodfellas is pretty close."

","I generally back away from gangster films. It's not my favorite genre. I have trouble with the aggrandizement of this amoral subcult. This, however, is a masterpiece. It's almost documentary in its portrayal of this society of evil. Martin Scorsese has assembled the cream of the crop of actors who have cut their teeth on the successors of the Godfather. I can't begin to do justice to all the actors in this film. What I can attest to is the danger that lurks in every scene. In one scene the hard wired character played by Joe Pesci (marvelous and crazy) shoot a guy named ""Spider"" for not getting him the right drink. The rest of the men must sit there, without compassion, because this is a normal day, with ""normal"" events. There is also the second group. The wives and the families who are stuck in the middle of all this, pretending their husbands work nine-to-five jobs, while they are out hitting people. Ultimately, there is Robert de Niro who is the craziest of all. Played with subtle control, he dominates every scene. This is a true masterpiece that's hard to watch."

","This is one of those movies that's pretty much nothing but classic scenes. Thinking about ""Goodfellas"" is essentially re-imagining the entire movie, usually starting of with Joe Pesci. Pesci's is by far the most threatening character in this movie, and the atmosphere gets really tensed when someone gets in his way somehow. He doesn't want to be pushed, and you don't want him to be pushed. The scene where he asks what makes him funny is one of the most uncomfortable moments ever caught on film. This movie often feels uncomfortable in fact. Whenever any secondary character is involved in a conversation, you know something will go wrong. The shady background characters in this movie really drop like flies, this movie has an incredible amount of raw violence and ice cold death scenes. Even by the standards of a classic crime movie, this movie just feels really harsh and unpleasant. Which doesn't make it any less entertaining, by the way, this movie really knows when to move on.

I haven't read the novel, nor do I know anything about Hill that this film didn't tell me, but I understand that that this is a faithful adaptation, and that both give an honest recounting of his life. This can perhaps best be described as a portrayal of the environment, showing good and bad alike. The glamorous nature of that way of life is put up on the screen, and you definitely understand its appeal. Scorsese doesn't fail us for a second of this. It is brutal, funny, charming, bloody, intense and entertaining. The writing is excellent. Narration as well as dialog are incredible and highly memorable and quotable. The plot is interesting and develops nicely. Strong storytelling is one of the things that keeps you watching. The characters and personalities is another. Cinematography and editing are top-notch. The scoring is spot-on, with every music piece being fantastic and fitting(directly or ironically) at the same time. Every single acting performance is perfect, not only Liotta, Pesci and of course DeNiro. The pacing is marvelous. Mood and atmosphere are established masterfully. The language doesn't hold back, neither in tone nor in amount. There is some sexuality, not terribly graphic. Violence is unrestrained. This has disturbing content. The DVD comes with four featurettes(coming to about an hour in running time, all put together), as well as two commentary tracks... ""Cast and Crew""(self-explanatory) and ""Cop and Crook""(the actual Henry, and one of the feds who worked against the mob). All of it is worth the time.

"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","2","5 April 2009"," one of the more important films of our time
","When he was asked to name the best films of the 1990s, film critic Roger Ebert not only ranked Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" as the best next to ""Fargo"" (1996) but also labeled it ""the best mob movie ever."" A friend of Scorsese's, Ebert also labeled the filmmaker as the finest director in the United States today. To me, ""Goodfellas"" is not the best film about organized crime. That reward goes to ""The Godfather"" (1972). But if there ever was a film to replace ""The Godfather"" (1972) as the best mafia movie, ""Goodfellas"" would be it.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" is one of those rare cases where a true story about violence and ferocity is adapted for the screen but without bringing it to a glorious sense like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962). The said 60s film took a tale of heroism mixed with narcissistic violence to create a sweeping epic. What Scorsese does is take the dark plot of the underworld and the mafia and make it look exactly like what it was and still is today. It is a fabulous retelling of the story of Henry Hill, a part-Italian kid who grew up amongst the mobsters and sought to become one of them.<br/><br/>Unlike other mob movies, ""Goodfellas"" does not make heroes or role models out of its characters. The movie centers around the people of the mafia underworld and avoids the civilians who would ultimately become victims of them and their ways. Instead, Scorsese and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi make cruel and dislikable characters and masterfully command the cast into representing them. Most particularly is the character played by Joe Pesci. The character, again based on a real-life person, is like a tender human explosive. Just touch the surface of it and it goes off, tearing or blowing apart anything that provokes it. Pesci's character is the kind of man who if you insult him verbally, even as a joke, he will beat you half to death or just whip out his gun and empty it into your heart and then sit down and finish whatever he was doing in the first place and not shed a tear or let out a sigh of regret over your mangled remains. Like a wild animal, he is unpredictable and cannot be controlled; only put down. And the sickening thing is that Robert De Niro's character is actually fond of this monstrosity of a man. We only learn the bad sides of these men; not their good sides, for they probably lost it all when they joined the mafia. We see them cheat on their spouses, murder people in broad daylight, traffic drugs, destroy property, and again, they do it for their own satisfaction. There's no morality, not even among themselves. The movie opens with a brutal scene of what these men do and yet the Ray Liotta character immediately states afterward: ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster. To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United Statesit was there that I knew that I belonged.""<br/><br/>This is a brutal and savage world these men lived in and Martin Scorsese excellently brings this back to screen to give us a new impression of the mafia and reminds us that these kind of people still exist today and are not heroes or images for civilized people not even in the vaguest sense. In regards to the cast, it is perfect. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for his performance) were quintessentially cast in their roles. The only part I thought was wrongly developed was Lorraine Bracco's character. I just felt the character was either too over the top or Bracco overacted a little, but this is a forgivable weakness and it's hardly a weakness at all. There is also the two-and-a-half-hour running time, which I felt was just a little too long. But these few minor flaws aside, ""Goodfellas"" is certainly one of the most important films of the past twenty years in an era where Hollywood seems to have lost its motivation for films beyond the conventional range."

","I absolutely adore this film. It's clever, shocking, funny, violent, educational and entertaining.<br/><br/>The entire cast play their parts brilliantly, from the spine-tingling Tommy, to the smooth, under-control Jimmy.<br/><br/>The film catches the zeitgeist in an exceptional manner, and shows both sides of the coin when you're a gangster - the perks and the ugly side.<br/><br/>Scorcese's use of comedy, mixed with horrific moments brings the film into a different light, as it is not just about being dangerous and deadly, but there are also humorous elements added to the mix as well.<br/><br/>Overall, the film shows that loyalty has its benefits, but in the end, the friend who screws the other over first will be the one that gets away with everything."
"jdice11","10","1","2","17 July 2008"," A masterpiece showing the trials and tribulations of being a gangster
","One of the most famous lines in Goodfellas is ""Ever since I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."" It turns out that Goodfellas shows that what one may ultimately want may not be the best for them. As a young boy Henry Hill looked up to the ""gangster"" life. There were many aspects of the ""gangster"" lifestyle that attracted Henry. A gangster does what he wants with no regard to anyone else. Gangsters often operate in groups or ""families."" It was when Henry takes his first job working at the local pizza shop that he was first introduced to the gangster life. Henry witnessed interaction between different gangsters and started to yearn for the lifestyle of a gangster. Henry's yearning became more evident when he began taking on small ""odds and end"" jobs for the owner of the pizza shop. <br/><br/>As a man in his early twenties, Henry continues on his quest for what he thought would make the ""perfect"" life as a gangster. The fame associated with the gangsters he witnessed as a young boy is what initially attracted him and now he started to experience the gangster life. Henry continued his experience by continuing to work jobs for mob bosses, such as Frankie Carbone. Henry continued working these ""gangster"" jobs, even after he was disowned by his mother and father. As Henry continued through his twenties, he continued obtaining everything that he wanted, including a gorgeous wife, cars, money, and respect. The wife, the cars and the money are all things that gangsters work hard to obtain and now Henry had obtained them. Henry continued to work hard and to build his wealth, as shown in the scene where Henry and all of his friends are gathered around a table and they dumb a huge bag of money on the table. This was after he and his friends pull off one of the biggest heists in history. With this wealth, Henry began to start new business ventures that would ultimately prove to be bad decisions. Like previously stated, gangsters do whatever they want to do. This sometimes even occurs against the ""boss'"" orders. One of the pivotal parts of the movie is when the boss, Frankie, finds out the Henry went against his wishes and was now in trouble. Frankie helps Henry one last time, and then tells him that he is turning his back on him. This isn't the first time Henry is smacked in the face. Frankie turning his back on Henry begins to show that Henry could potentially be on the down fall. It was after this point that Henry begins to watch his back wherever he goes. This even occurs around his friends, Jimmy and Tommy. This type of behavior might be seen as unordinary, especially around people that are friends. Another pivotal part of the film is towards the end. It is after Henry and his family go into the witness protection program. Henry and his family enter the program because Henry ""folds"" on Frankie and Jimmy. You can see the tension through a high angle shot that is focusing on Frankie and Jimmy in the courtroom. This truly shows that Henry holds the power. Henry and his family enter the program and are immediately moved away from New York. The viewer is able to see that Henry has lost everything. As Henry is on the porch, the camera begins to zoom in and Henry says that he is now a ""nobody."" This shows that he has come so far, and at the end he is not what he wanted to be. Henry looks as though he has lost everything and like he has hit rock bottom. <br/><br/>Goodfellas shows that you may want something, but it may not always be the best choice for you. Much like the film Scarface, it turns out that the money, the fame, and the gangster life it not a good decision. ""Ever since I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"" was not a good choice for Henry. He lost everything and now feels that he is a ""nobody."" It turned out that all of Henry's hard work and dedication to be a gangster did not get him what he wanted. Ultimately, it made him a ""nobody."""
"Dr_Coulardeau","9","1","2","9 April 2008"," Good, slightly long but probably realistic
","A long film about ""Italian"" crime in New York in the 1950-1980 period, and a good one at that. It shows the brutality and the extreme male chauvinism of these gangsters who are ready to sell anything, steal anything, kill anyone in order to make money, and as for killing, to satisfy their insatiable thirst for blood, to satisfy their unquenchable hunger for violence. It also shows, rather on the side because it is not the main object, how justice and before it the police are managing their gang-spirit, splitting their unity and getting the weaker ones to become protected witnesses, and it works: these criminals prefer being hidden away by the Justice Department for decades rather than going away in prison for even longer periods of time. The film is well done: Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci are quite acceptable. Ray Liotta on the other hand appears slightly weak when confronted to the other two, and he has to be since he is the side-kick, and an essential one at that, of both of them. One shortcoming though: even if the police managed to more or less bring the Italians back in line, the film is absolutely silent about the fact that the various traffics and particularly drugs were then abandoned to another mafia, probably even more dangerous, i.e. the Blacks and the Porto Ricans and other Latinos.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

"TomCruiseFan99","10","1","2","14 March 2008"," A true crime masterpiece
","One of my favorite films of all time, second only to A Few Good men, this darkly comic and boldly violent gangster epic is a true masterpiece. Featuring career-best performances from Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco as well as a career-making one from Joe Pesci, who fully deserved his Academy Award.<br/><br/>The film follows a 30-year period in the lives of Henry Hill (Liotta) and his association with the Italian Mafia. The script features some of the most laugh-out-loud moments ever in a serious crime drama (all the good bits are delivered with extra zing by Pesci), and also some of the most expletive-filled rants (once again, courtesy of Pesci). The violence won't be for all tastes, but it's necessary in this story, especially when the script constantly surprises you and you start realizing that you have no idea who might live and who might die or who's going to jail and who'll live happy ever after.<br/><br/>Because as Henry soon finds out, once you're in the family, there's no way out. Special mention has to be made of Scorsese's brilliant directing, which includes some glorious unbroken tracking shots and a 60's Motown soundtrack that's to die for. A classic in every sense of the word."

From his teenage years running errands for the neighborhood Mafioso's while rising through the ranks by hijacking truckloads of cigarettes, to him being on top of his limited but somewhat powerful mob world, to the deepest part of a cocaine addiction and digging shallow graves to bury a not dead body that was in the trunk of his car. All in all, this depiction of the wise-guy lifestyle, along with the actions taken by these men in order to carry on with this lifestyle, is done in a way that has oft been imitated but never duplicated. A wonderful story, made into a superb film."

","While I had previously seen this Martin Scorsese picture before, it was on network television which meant I didn't hear the profanity and the violent scenes were trimmed. Despite that, I remember enjoying the movie very much. Now that I've seen it uncensored and on HD DVD, it doesn't impress me as much as before perhaps because in jumping several years in various segments, you half wonder what happened during those in-between times. Still, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Larraine Bracco impress with their performances with Paul Sorvino lending gravity with his appearances throughout and nice cameos by up-and-coming newcomers like Illeana Douglas, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, and Michael Imperioli. Also amusing were cameos by the director's parents, Catherine and Charles, especially Catherine's as Pesci's mother. Pesci may be the most impressive of the bunch in his Oscar-winning role as Tommy who turns from highly amused to very angry at a dime. Perhaps not one for the mainstream crowd who wants at least one likable character to identify with but a mostly compelling account of the true story of what mob life really was like for someone who lived through it."

"edwardjamessmith","10","1","2","30 December 2007"," Goodfellas has to be Martin Scorsese's best film along with Taxi Driver!
","Martin Scorsese is just quite simply one of the influenced film-makers in the business. All his films are done with style and character. ""Goodfellas"" (1990) is a film which felt so realistic (it's based on a true story) and the way it was put together just looked impossible (with the editing,the dialog voice-overs, the angles, the setting, etc...) but that's what film-making is all about: making the impossible possible on the big screen and Scorsese did that and he succeeded. I can now see where Quentin Tarantino came from with his influences which I find fascinating. Goodfellas, in my opinion is better than the Godfather films and any other rip-offs. I just don't understand why this film didn't win best film of 1990 (""Dances with wolves"", what were they thinking!). It was because of the violence and the ironic thing is that's what the film's about: a life of violence in the mafia and all the film is doing is trying to show how violence is in reality (which is very important). Goodfellas is by far the greatest gangster film ever made in a long time and it's martin scorsese's best film along with 1976's Taxi Driver (the film that showed how an individual can be just be a complete nutter). Another great film which has won its place in my 100 greatest films of all time. 10/10"
"benchair","10","1","2","29 December 2007"," Scorsese's finest.
","GoodFellas: My favorite Scorsese movie. My favorite mob movie. My favorite movie.<br/><br/>This film is a legendary masterpiece from Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets) about the life and times of Mobster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta in his finest role). Liotta narrates the film with sharp dialogue about the glorious times he had as a gangster and his association with close associate and professional thief Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro in an unpredictable role) and the psychopathic funny guy Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci in his Oscar* winning role).<br/><br/>The film opens with Henry, Jimmy and Tommy in a car. Then Henry watches as Jimmy and Tommy brutally murder a badly wounded man (who we find out more about as the film progresses), then Henry utters his most famous lines ""As far back as I remembered I always wanted to be a gangster. We are then informed and shown Henry's childhood and how he became associated with the Mob. The rest of the film covers most of real-life Henry Hill's biggest memories and events in his life (Such as Meeting Karen, His children and the Luftanza Heist).<br/><br/>GoodFellas features many masterfully set pieces such as the entire 'Funny guy' improvisation scene: Where Henry and the gangsters are being amused by Tommy telling jokes about his history and then asks exactly why he is so funny. The Billy Batt's beat down where Jimmy and Tommy severely beat Billy Batts after he insulted Tommy, as Henry watches in horror. Henry beating the next door neighbor Bruce after Bruce assaults Karen. Henry showing Karen through the Copacabana club instead of waiting in line and Henry's last day as a wiseguy.<br/><br/>This film was very underrated at the Oscars. In my opinion this film should have won best picture, Director and Screenplay. I was shocked to see that Ray Liotta was not nominated for Best Actor but I was pleased to see that Pesci won best supporting. The acting in this film is superb. Ray Liotta always is that type of character who seems calm for a moment then in a second goes into rage. Especially the scene where he walks across the street to Bruce's house normally but then in a second flies into rage and beats him down. De Niro gave a chilling role, you didn't know when he was happy or not, you couldn't tell whether he would whack you or not. Pesci was excellent because even though he was a brutal cold hearted killer, he still stayed as a very likable character. And finally Lorraine Bracco as Henry's Jewish wife Karen, in some scenes out of control and her lines ""Uusally I would break up with a man if he planted a gun in my hands, but it turned me on."" The set pieces and dialog of characters in this film and superb direction by Scorsese should have won another three Oscars.<br/><br/>Rated R for occasional Graphic Violence, strong language and brief drug use. But the best Mob movie on the planet Earth."

This film, which was robbed of the Oscar for Best picture in favor of Dances With Wolves, stands out as a movie that people will be talking about for decades to come. Its not just that the script and every performance by the actors was Oscar worthy, its also the directing by Scorsese that puts this film over the top. Any film school worth its weight will spend many hours taking this film apart frame by frame. The Camera work, the editing, the placement of music- this film stands out as one of the greatest films of all time. Can anybody forget the scene where Hill's character is ushered through the nightclub with his date? Can anybody who hears the chorus from Layla by Eric Clapton ever not think about the amazing scene that accompanies it? The performance by Joe Pesci is one of the greatest of all time. The character is revolting and yet compelling at the same time. Its very hard to get an audience to feel both emotions and when it works, its brilliant.<br/><br/>Now add to this the fact that this story is based on the true life of a real person named Henry Hill and it makes this movie even more interesting to watch.

The beginning of the film worked well for me - one could really get in the head of young Henry and understand what turned him on to the wise guy life. I loved the detail in the first third of the film. The storytelling took a bad turn for me, though. Everything after his marriage seemed to spiral out of a personal reality and into a ""this happened, and then that happened, and then that..."" form of storytelling. The last third just moved too fast for me; I lost my connection to the characters and by the time the end credits rolled around I wasn't connected to the gravity of what was going on.

","The themes of this extraordinary film are in fact quite ordinary when you think about it. The wish that Henry Hill has to be respected and to have all of his desires fulfilled are wishes that we all can relate to. The fact that he has to lie, cheat and steal and in some cases kill to get it, will probably not relate to many but in Henry's world it is just as ordinary as brushing your teeth. Martin Scorsese paints a portrait of a man who wants it all but is somehow unwilling to pay the price.<br/><br/>The character Henry Hill, based on a real person, is weak in spirit. He doesn't seem to be ruthless enough to be a gangster and it will eventually spell his doom. Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance that really shows range. He has played bad guys before but also basically decent men like his role in ""Dominick and Eugene"" and ""Corrina, Corrina"". Here he covers both sides. He is immensely nasty to everybody who tries to steal from him but is also quite sympathetic when it comes to looking out for his family. His wife, played by Lorraine Bracco, is not really a criminal but she is turned on by crime and the fact that Henry kills for a living is not something that bothers her in the beginning.<br/><br/>There are several good supporting performances in this movie but to name just the really important: 1) Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway (even though he has top billing). This is not one of his best roles but he is an important figure in the last part of the movie and the way he reacts to the death of somebody really close to him is quite frightening but then again that's no big surprise. 2) Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito. What can you say except: Bravo! Nobody could have played this totally evil character better. And finally Paul Sorvino as Paul. His may not be the most flamboyant role but he does have some eccentricacies that are quite amusing and unlike Marlon Brando in The Godfather, he has a more relaxed performing style and he is therefore more credible as a real person.<br/><br/>The superb editing of Thelma Schoonmaker must also be credited for making this film such an exhilarating experience. Three hours seem like a half in this film and it's nice that she just won her second Oscar for the Aviator.<br/><br/>The truth is that even though Scorsese has made bad movies his track record is the absolute best for any filmmaker. So let's hope that he does something outstanding very soon as he has been in kind of a slump lately."

","Spoilers((( Martin Scorsese created this brilliant masterwork in 1990 and made a new important chapter in gangster movie history. Starring the top-notch actors Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci this movie is based on the true story of Henry Hill and his gangster career that stands as one of history's most magnificent mob stories.<br/><br/>Henry Hill is a local boy who's been working for the mob since early days, now being an adult he still serves for them. His since-school-days (although they never went to school) friend Tommy DeVito is a pre Italian maniac. And there's Jimmy Conway, the man who puts these two fellas up together, and is doing some of the worst crimes New York City has ever seen. But soon Henry is put in jail and everything that has always been so bright and okay, suddenly goes upside-down and things starts looking bad for the guy, who's always wanted to be a gangster...<br/><br/>GOODFELLAS isn't just one of the definitive movies ever made, it makes its march brutally right on the spot, leaving everything that's been earlier made of mafia movies too old to stand up to it when it was released. It's challenger's are few; but there are two (maybe three if you set up the sequel) heavyweighters doing their thing too; THE GODFATHER and ONCE UPON A TIME IN America (last one also starring De Niro). Martin Scorsese had already showed the world that he was one of the most impressing director's to be in Hollywood at the time, and this settled his march once and for all as one of cinema history's biggest. Soon after this gangster installment Scorsese made another mob-movie with De Niro and Pesci, named CASINO, also a great achievement, but it can't stand against this. GOODFELLAS doesn't just have the perfect timing of drama, suspense, violence and pure Italian anger, the soundtrack playing fabulously along with great tracks as ""Gimme Shelter"", ""Stardust"", ""Bells Of St.Marys"" and ""Memo From Turner"". The actors are all amazing, and if I had to pick a favourite among the trio I had to say Liotta, although he didn't achieve an Oscar for his performance (Pesci did) his character simply fixes everything, going threw pissed-wife-happenings, drug-related-cases, killings and emotionally disturbance. <br/><br/>The violence of the movie just let us see the real brutality inside mob business, Pesci striking a knife, De Niro kicking face, Liotta punching guy's face apart with a gun, Pesci sticking a knife into a guy's backhead...I mean, it's a pretty messed up brutal movie, and that simply sets the mood right. You know this is brutal business, it's illegal with capitol I, people get killed and business that's so freaking wrong for the law are done - and it's pure mafia. Seeing Ray Liotta stepping out of the car after he gets to know that the friendly-neighbourhood-(Spider is the bartender)man has been touching and offending his wife, is a sight simply making the hair rise. It reminds a bit off Caan in THE GODFATHER when he heads to kick his sister's husband's ass, well, I gotta say; Liotta isn't just three steps more violent, he is also three steps more calm and cool. GOODFELLAS is an amazing movie, and it really gives Coppola's 1972 mafia movie a real breather in the neck. STARS: 5/5"

","Movies don't get any better then this!<br/><br/>The problem with gangster movies is that it always will be compared to the brilliant ""Godfather"" movies. Often when you do that you come to the conclusion that it's a very bad movie, however ""Goodfellas"" doesn't suffer from this curse. It's just as genius and at some points even better as the ""Godfather"" movies.<br/><br/>That it's based on true events also makes the movie interesting to watch. Rarely has the live of a gangster been portrayed so wonderfully and interesting. The story is told in a wonderful way without getting boring for a single second. Who didn't wanted to be a gangster for a day after seeing this movie ???<br/><br/>Next to the story there are three other truly great things about the movie: The cast, the characters and the dialogue. The cast is full with famous actor that all have been cast perfectly. Joe Pesci of course truly steals the show and it's no wonder he won a Oscar for his role. The famous ""You think I'm funny?"" scene with him is brilliant and amuses me every time, it truly is one of the best scene's of all time. A real classic! But let's not forget Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro who also give an amazing performance. Same goes for Catherine Scorsese as Joe Pesci's character Tommy's mother. She plays really natural and lot of fun scene's with great dialogue are the result. The wonderful stereotype gangster characters also add to this movie. How can you not like characters such as Frankie Carbone, Edward Stacks, Johnny two times, Morrie or Vinnie who puts too much tomatoes in the sauce. The movie is full with sharp and sometimes cruel but funny dialogue. All this things combined makes this a classic and magnificent movie, a movie that you MUST have at least seen once in your lifetime.<br/><br/>The movie is full with many great long scene's. Some of the longest I have ever seen. Most of those long scene's are the highlight of the movie. Great directing from Martin Scorsese!<br/><br/>Although it's a quite heavy movie it actually is also for some reason a fun movie to watch over and over again without getting ever boring.<br/><br/>Nothing short of brilliant!

"WriterDave","10","1","2","13 July 2003"," The Myth of ""The Greatest Film of All Time"" Brought to Glorious Life
","If you hate mob movies, or hate Scorsese, then you probably won't be able to sit through this. But for the rest of us out there, this is arguably one of the best films of the 1990's, possibly one of the best of all time, and without a doubt one of the most influential films of the past twenty years. Every mob movie/underworld saga/generational tale/crime thriller from ""Pulp Fiction"" to ""Boogie Nights"" to ""Blow"" (which played like the TV movie version of a great Scorsese flick) to TV's ""The Sopranos"" owes a debt to this film. Scorsese was at the top of his game here, and what makes this film stand tall above all other movies of this ilk (including Scorsese's own ""Casino""--a great film in its own right) is that there is an overwhelming visceral charge to the film that makes it all seem so enjoyable despite the onslaught of blood, foul language, and unsavory activities. You are made to believe that these gangsters were having the time of their lives. So too were Scorsese and pals in making the film. And lastly, so too are we the audience in watching it all. Everything came together in this film so perfectly the viewer is left feeling oddly giddy amongst all the true life bloodshed. This sense of ""fun"" is the one thing that his recent ""Gangs of New York"" was missing, and may be what keeps that film from being ranked as one of the all time greats.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Pesci is all at once hilarious and scary. De Niro is at his best. And Liotta gives a career defining performance (only in the recent ""Narc"" has he been able to recapture some of this magic). <br/><br/>As for some of the finer details, I dare you to find a movie that makes better use of popular music or Steady-cam shots. The cinematography, editing, set designs and costumes (that traverse the varied stylings of the 1950's , 60's, 70's and early 80's) are all pitch perfect. Is there a better scene than when Liotta takes Lorraine Braco to the Copacabana for the first time and introduces her to the perks of gangster life while ""And Then he Kissed Me"" plays on the soundtrack? Will you ever be able to listen to ""Layla"" without thinking about mob hits and a frozen body in a meat truck? <br/><br/>All these things, a communion with the audience (here we share Scorsese's joy both in making a film and in our watching it), top-notch production values, great performances, and a lasting influence on later films are the earmarks of a great movie, the pinnacle of a great director's career, and one of the greatest films of all time. ""Goodfellas"" may never reach the mythical status ""The Godfather"" saga did, but as great films like this are becoming few and far in between, it makes you believe in the myth of the ""greatest film of all time."" Maybe it is, most likely it isn't, but we the audience for a brief moment, maybe for just one scene, are pretty much convinced THIS IS IT."
"Derek237","10","1","2","30 January 2003"," Scorsese at his best
","Goodfellas is an all around great movie. If you don't immediately love it, it'll probably grow on you soon enough. Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, and Joe Pesci all give the best performances in their careers and it is arguably Martin Scorsese's best directorial effort. Sure, it's up there among his best with Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, and Raging Bull, but this one just stands out more. I think what makes Goodfellas so great is it's compilation of elements like the acting, storytelling, character development, and dialogue. My One complaint is that Robert DeNiro is not in the movie as much as you'd expect, and I was always left wanting more. But maybe that's a good thing.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is an amazing, unforgettable film that everyone should see. If you haven't already had the pleasure of seeing it, go rent it right now. It could just change your life.<br/><br/>My Rating: 10/10"
"vincew9298","8","1","2","31 May 2002"," A very good movie but a few major flaws.
","When I saw ""Goodfellas"" I knew everything that was going to happen because it was based on a book called ""Wise Guys"" that I had read a few years before. Though I knew what was coming I was pleased with the acting, at it's best. The character were developed and depicted in a way that I though made them almost like heros. Some, like Pesci's , were amusing and sometimes funny. Conway was presented in a truer light, and I think that only an actor of DeNiro's caliber was capable of showing James Conway as the truly mean and vicious person he was in life. Henry Hill and his wife Karen are presented almost as victims and one could almost feel sorry for them. It's hard not to like Lorraine Bracco in any role she plays and I wish that they had cast someone not as likable as her as Mrs Hill. I, being involved in law enforcement for nearly twenty-five years saw them as criminals. The scenes depicted in the jails was as true to life as possible. I just feel that the way the criminals are made into heroes is a bad message to present to young people. More of the needless murder and suffering, the survivors family and loved ones left to pick up the pieces are neglected and ignored. Henry committing felonies on a daily basis, Karen living a glamorous life, and when they finally get caught and ready to be sent to jail, where they belong, become outstanding citizens by informing on their friends. Hill and his wife are no better than any of the others that committed felonies, condoned and participated in murder, robbery, assault, drug dealing and extortion. The flaw is that these characters are made to be sympathetic victims. It wasn't poor Henry's fault that for as long as he could remember he wanted to be a criminal. It wasn't Karen's fault that she felt all the glamour surrounding a life of extortion and theft. Her mother, presented as a mean interfering woman was another victim as was her father, presented as sickly and spineless. They truly suffered, seeing their daughter getting involved in a life with such trash. A message sent to young people that this type of life is fun, great and carefree is not a good message. Lets face it, Hill continues to be a criminal, even if not on the same scale he still goes into stores and steals from the shelf and we, the general public,  have to make up for the vendors lose because of this. Let's present the characters for what they are. Poor Tommy being murdered because he resented being shot by a mean coward. A man trying to make a living running a nightclub having his business being stolen or a poor mailman making his daily round sand being assaulted for doing what he was suppose to do, deliver the mail to the addressee and so many more depicted in the movie not as victims but as an occasional ship passing in the night and happening to be passing a barge filled with garbage. The movie is entertaining, but lets not forget that in real life these characters left a trail of victims and so much unnecessary hurt."

The soundtrack is an excellent selection of music representing different time periods.  It brings you into Henry Hill's infatuation with Karen, as well as his infatuation with drugs.

","Well - here it goes.. In my area everyone ""loves"" the mob way of life.. Everyone loves ""The Sopranos"" and I also find it enjoyable to watch a great mob movie and then imagine for a minute that Im a part of it.. For most of my life there has been only one movie to even speak of when it came to this subject - The Godfather Epic. For those of you not familiar with it it was the Godfather Parts I and II edited in chronological order.. I've seen it several times and to this day my Dad still thinks that this is the best mob story ever told..<br/><br/>But With all due respect..<br/><br/>I just watched Goodfellas for the 12th time and - There is no doubt in my mind that Goodfellas is the best mob movie ever made..<br/><br/>The story starts off during the Golden Age of Organizied Crime 1955 Brooklyn NY. A young Henry Hill is intrigued by the mob way of life - and let's be honest - why not !?.. They have it all - respect, wealth, and power.. Everything about the movie at this point is made to ""romance"" you about the era.. The music, the cinematography, work so well together..its quite rare that a film can make you actually ""feel"" a part of it.. Goodfellas succeeds at this.. We meet all sorts of characters who add to the environment. Henry as he learns the ropes also decribes to the viewer how it works.. And just about the time your ready to stand-up and declare you wanna be a ""wiseguy"" When things are going so good -<br/><br/>Goodfellas smacks you right in the face and says - Whaddasamatta with you..<br/><br/>The deceit, the lying, the overall evil that consumes these people is staggering.. The movie shows that in the mob there is no love, no loyality, no care - even amonst themselves.. The biggest mistake the mob made was to include drugs into its ""business"".<br/><br/>Goodfellas exceeds the Godfather because of the feeling of inclusion you feel when watching it, it surrounds you and makes you feel like a part of the film.. I felt it's direction, and cinematography, and editing style are second to none.. This is Scorese and DeNiro's best film together..Raging Bull was great too but Casino was pale over this one -  Liotta was wonderful although he hasnt done much since.. and Pesci's best is My Cousin Vinny but his ""Tommy"" is very good - deserving of the Oscar that year - even though you wouldnt want to know him.<br/><br/>If your a fan of mob storys in general see if you can spot two Sopranos guys in the movie ! Also look for Samuel L Jackson in a bit part.."

","This movie/story is repulsive! Disgusting movie! When I first saw it, I was disgusted. Decades later, I'm disgusted again! I was curious why this movie still gets such high acclaim, so I watched it again. Now, I think I understand why so many claim it's the best movie of all time. Racists! Racists and gangster-minnow-minded would like this movie! They get to bust their chops over the dialogue of this crap movie! No wonder we still have so much hate and violence in our American society! We don't care about others. ""We"" like or tolerate the savage killing and mutilation of other human beings. Entertainment has to be shocking, brutal, with inconceivable dialogues. The laughter was equally repulsive. It was so many years/decades ago, when I first saw it. And I'm glad to know I still feel the same. For my character, it's a good thing. I still care about people in this world that has found ways to exist without actually communicating with people. We text! We ""chat"". We Facebook snoop! Are we immune or obsessed?"
"nikhilthemacho","1","2","7","21 March 2020"," Overrated and boring
","This film has no story. Just bunch of random guys acting cool with guns and killing people based on their liking. It has no suspense or thriller."
"cito500","5","2","7","2 August 2013"," Overrated and horribly mean-spirited
","Goodfellas is lauded as an amazing film, better than The Godfather and possibly the greatest mobster film of all time if not the greatest overall film. This is ridiculous.<br/><br/>Our protagonist, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), says he always wanted to be gangster. When he joins the mob, he and his friends experience the high-standard and high-risk life of gangsters. So the film follows his new life till its end.<br/><br/>I'll agree the directing and writing was impressive. Acting was well-performed too. The narrative told through the voice-over of Henry Hill and occasionally his wife (Lorraine Bracco) is enjoyable and the general progression of the storyline is good. Nice pacing, etc. I was definitely interested and the movie kept me submersed.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film, for me, were the characters. Almost none of them were likable. Henry Hill was a drug-addict, and sold drugs even though his long-time friend and boss Paulie Cicero specifically told him not to. Hill constantly gets into arguments with his wife, once threatening to kill her, and yet constantly cheats on her. He's always going on about how regular people are losers who don't know how to get on in life and acting like they deserve to have their livelihood taken from them. That's another thing: he steals whole shipments from truck drivers and airports.<br/><br/>Now I like gang movies as much as the next guy. The same goes for dark, depraved films. They're interesting. But I finished this movie with a unsatisfied, irritated feeling. I don't know how anyone could like these characters. By the end of the film I was waiting to see them all get their comeuppance. Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) is a maniac. He kills people left and right and for just mildly insulting him. He brutally murdered his life-long friend Billy Batts. Tommy shot and killed a kid because the boy told him to ""go f*** yourself"" and that was because he had already been shot in the foot by DeVito and the man just kept making fun of the kid. Sure the boy (his name was Spider) wasn't a teenager, but he was definitely in his twenties, probably early twenties. Not to mention Morris Kessler and that other guy from the restaurant. DeVito owed both of them money and when they patiently asked for it, he killed one of them and nearly killed the other. I wasn't sad when DeVito got ""whacked"" instead being made. I only wished his death was a little more painful instead of a simple shot to the head.<br/><br/>Anyway, Henry's wife Karen was also a bit of an jerk. She also threatens to kill him, and while most of her motives are reasonable, she doesn't have many redeemable traits. The same goes for pretty much all of the other main characters. Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) was unlikable and trigger-happy. Paulie was probably the only main character who wasn't a complete jerk. He, at least, had some common sense.<br/><br/>I know this is a gangster film, and this is based on real-life events and maybe its bleak violence could be considered ""edgy."" But this is definitely not better than The Godfather or other gangster films like The Untouchables. At least the characters in The Godfather were likable. They had a sense of honor and reason. I liked Vito Corleone, I liked Michael and Sonny and a bunch of the other characters. When they killed, it was for a better reason than these lunatics. When some of them got killed, I felt sad for them.<br/><br/>I guess the movie's overall production value is good, but it doesn't redeem it and it certainly doesn't make it better than The Godfather. If you're going to make characters who do horrible things, you have to do it for a better purpose. There needs to be depth or reasoning. This whole thing was needlessly mean-spirited. For me, the despicable characters ruined the whole experience. For you, it may not. That's just my opinion."
"kianzandy","1","3","14","23 April 2019"," poster critic
","Criticism of the movie poster: In the poster of the film, Robert DeNiro in the middle, Joe Peshi is on the right side and Ray Leota on the left. Seeing this arrangement, the mind of the audience is guided by Robert Digno's leading role, if Robert De Niro is not even a complementary actor in the film.
The bottom of these three is a dialog from the movie, which, in my opinion, ends the whole movie after the dialogue ends, and does not start.
The name of the film and the director's name below it, so that all of the weight above the poster is on this director's name. And a little tactful little slogan written: ""Decades of Life in the Mafia""! This sentence remains so much over the air during the film, which seems to be that the director may have been jokingly using the sentence in his poster, because not only does it not exist and does not have a mafia, but the passage of these decades is by no means inevitable It is not logical and it goes through the wind direction for decades, and stories like prison and ... are spent.
The poster member is also the person who has fallen in the middle of a street, and with that hat and cover, he must tell the audience that the story of the mafia is this way, and after several decades of living in the mafia, this death comes down to these decades. ."
"szlwson","5","2","8","26 June 2010"," I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more without the Tommy DeVito character.
","I found this movie quite annoying, mainly due to the Tommy DeVito character acting so stupid. <br/><br/>I couldn't believe a criminal organisation wouldn't have been caught before they did, with such a moron in it who would shoot a bar boy in the foot just for not being quick enough with the coffee. If that character hadn't been in it, I'm sure I would have been a lot more believable.<br/><br/>I know that there are people like that in the world, but there's no way they would get away with much if people acted that stupid and obvious.<br/><br/>It had a good message about how it's better to not get involved with those types and didn't glamorise it as with the Godfather films. Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea to show them as a bunch of clowns, but I still found it a little annoying at times as to how stupid they acted."
"powermandan","1","3","15","10 June 2015"," Great Movie, But Pretty Overrated.
","I did enjoy this film, but I think it gets a little too much praise. All three Godfather movies are far superior. This was innovative, but it ranks too high in all lists.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is based on the memoir ""Wiseguy"" about Henry Hill's life as a gangster. Ray Liotta plays Hill and gives are star-making performance. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy The Gent and Joe Pesci earns a well-deserved Oscar as Tommy DeVito. Hill grew up in urban New York and wanted to be a mobster his whole life. Only, he wasn't cut out. Tommy and Jimmy were his best friends and extremely brutal. There was reluctancy sometimes in Henry. He marries Karen (Bracco) and their family life is well-documented. As Henry becomes more like the other thugs, bis life crumbles and surrenders to the witness protection program. I thought that the story was great as it cover major parts in Hill's life and some infamous crimes in American history. Scorsese also recreates some bits from the book that come out better in the movie. For example, he adds lots to the scene with Spider. <br/><br/>I'm not saying this is the best mob movie ever like Roger Ebert said and I'm not saying it sucked. It will never reach The Godfather heights. Although the editing and film techniques were top- notch, it was not enough. One thing I didn't like was that it practically glorified being a mobster. There's so much loyalty and it makes it out to be fun. Being a gangster is not fun. Sure it's good that everybody is treated better, but they do horrible things that puts everybody in danger. Goodfellas does show that the mafia can be bad, but there's so many circumstances surrounding them that can be learned from. <br/><br/>Another thing I didn't like was the music. The music was too loud and too good. Great music such as the Rolling Stones and Bobby Darin were playing. They proved to be distracting and did not fit well with some bit. Why not just use regular background music instead of hit songs that are overpowering? <br/><br/>Then there's the flow and story. As I mentioned above, the story is good but does not come across to its potential. Some of the scenes go great by themselves but not all work well as a whole. They jump around too much without giving leads in or out. It just goes from thing-to- thing-to-thing-thing over the course of minutes, plus there's the distracting music. I don't mind 146 minutes, but it seems like 5 hours was condensed in half its time. Some parts could have been cut out and replaced with more flows and better plot development. <br/><br/>Goodfellas is a brilliant flick, but not one of the best."
"jose-cruz53","7","3","16","11 October 2012"," One of the Worst Films Ever Made
","Whats the best film by Martin Scorsese? Taxi Driver all the way.<br/><br/>Okay, I will disagree with the popular and critic opinion that this is one of the best films ever, in fact, this is one of the worst films ever made. Why? Well, the acting is superb, the structure is superb as well, the cinematography is superb. In a technical sense, Goodfellas is one of the most well constructed and articulated films ever made. It truly grabs you by the neck and takes you on to a journey you will never forget.<br/><br/>And that;'s why it is one of the worst films ever made: it is easy to make a pathetically bad film, such as ""Dude Where is My Car?"", it is not easy to make a film that makes you hate the entire cast of characters. The fact is that each one of the characters in this film is terrible: Tommy DeVito is among the most pathetic characters ever made: a guy who kills people due to his own insecurity. I wanted to see him suffer, but the film never let him suffer, that made me anxious!<br/><br/>This is a great film, but not great in the good sense, its great in the bad sense. Hence, one of the worst film experiences I ever had."
"Jakealope","6","2","9","12 December 2006"," Utterly Guilty Pleasure, Like Cheesecake, Keep Away from Kids
","First off, this is really a well made movie, with Martin Scorcese's bringing to life all the hoodlum midlifes and lowlifes he knows so well. The cast is A1, and includes all the usually suspects like Sorvino, Liotta, DENIRO, Pesci, and future Soprano's luminaries like Lorraine Bracco, Mike Imperioli, Tony Sirico, Vincent Pastore, as well as Eugene Levy and Sam Jackson. I mention SOPRANOS boldly cause this movie definitely is the template for the Sopranos and other revisionist mob comedy/dramas.<br/><br/>It chronicles the real life exploits of Henry Hill, a mobster who ratted out his pals in Queens and became a notorious witness protection screw up, then cashed on on his criminal/mob past with his books and this movie, So in all the murder, racketeering and mayhem he was an accomplice, though it is tempered by Liotta, with a great ""nice bad guy"" act. Paul Sorvino, as Pauli, is the template for all mob boss types, who shuffles around grilling sausages while commanding his little crime fief.<br/><br/>Here is the problem. Unlike the ""Godfather"" series, which almost canonizing the mobsters with old world grandeur, this movie is upfront that these mobsters are greedy bullies, just out to have a good time. They are fun loving party animals who threaten to kill the club owner they suck off of as he tries to collect the tab from Tommy DeVito, the fun loving murderous little psychopath that made Joe Pesci a household name, and his character niche. That's the problem, the movie glorifies gangster life and is a media ""pimp ride"" for a killer hood like real life Henry Hill. It's more than a morally dubious movie. Even ""Clockwork Orange"" which was banned in England with the help of Stanley Kubrick, was more of a morality play than this. Without belaboring the point, since Scorcese is such a good film maker, he puts a glam spin on these real life people who should be swinging from the gallows, not serving as role models for a growing psychopath. That is why I only gave it a 6, it deserves a 9.5 by most ""normal"" movie scales. It is funny, dramatic and always interesting. The music, the good hits of the time mirroring Hill's career from the late 40's to the late 70'sis a great melding of pop culture. It is almost uproariously funny. I only recommend this to mature adults, which excludes about half the country."

It's actually a crutch.<br/><br/>That said, Liotta turned in a Best Actor Oscar worthy performance.I don't think he was even nominated. Peschi deserved his Oscar for Best Suppoting actor. Both guys were intense and turned in flawless performances. DeNiro, oddly enough, turned in a sub par performance. His character was very understated and showed noting of the deranged killer he was to have portrayed. Lots of great scenes and period pieces. The rock n' roll soundtrack worked well. Lots of tunes from the Rolling Stones' 1972 album, ""Exile on Main Street"", as well as other Stones songs. <br/><br/>But oh, what could have been.

In fact they're despicable low life scum and if I was around when they were around I would give them all a good clip around the ear and teach them to show a bit more respect to people. Otherwise, a nice solid film. It inspired me and Clem to grow pencil moustaches and to tough up some of the local kids on our estate.

","Director Martin Scorsese more than puts Nicoas Pileggi's Wiseguy on the screen...GOODFELLAS is a high octane crime drama based on the life of Henry Hill. Henry as a young boy, half-Irish, half-Sicilian and half-Jewish if need be, wanted nothing more than being like the ""wise guys"" in business across the street from his home in Brooklyn. Although the neighborhood was impoverished, money flowed like water around the mobsters that Henry idolized. Henry(Ray Liotta) is taken under the wing of Paul Cicero(Paul Sorvino)and would distinguish himself as he rose through the ranks of the ""crime family"". Henry was the golden boy until a reckless deal threaten the security of the family. Knowing he was a marked man, Hill turned informant and New York crime families fell like dominoes.<br/><br/>Scorsese and Pileggi collaborated on the screenplay which was greatly enhanced with Scorsese's masterful use of soundtrack music to complement the extraordinary story line. Just a few featured in the soundtrack are: Tony Bennett, Jerry Vale, The Moonglows, The Crystals, Dean Martin, Bobby Darin, the Ronettes, Cream and The Rolling Stones.<br/><br/>Giving the movie much authenticity is a wonderful cast that includes: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, Frank Sivero, Chuck Low, Gina Mastrogiacomo and Frank DiLeo."
"DylansFearFiles","10","1","3","29 September 2007"," A True Story Of A Gangster
","What would it be like to be a foot soldier in the Mafia? Would it be exciting? Would it be frightening? Violent even? Or would it be a similar lifestyle to what is portrayed in Mario Puzo's The Godfather trilogy? In Martin Scorsese's mafia classic Goodfellas you get an amazing look into the life of a gangster. This is based on the best-selling and critically acclaimed true-crime novel, Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family by crime reporter Nicholas Pileggi (who also co-wrote the screenplay with director, Martin Scorsese) which is the first hand account of Irish-Italian Lucchesse crime family associate turned FBI informant, Henry Hill. This movie tells the story behind many infamous crimes such as the 1978 $6,000,000 Lufthansa Air Line robbery which led to the murders of ten people. This movie also includes a fabulous rock/pop soundtrack with songs such as the Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter and Sid Vicious' My Way.<br/><br/>The story begins as an Irish-Italian twelve year old boy, Henry Hill, later played by Ray Liotta, admires the Mafiosi that operate in his neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, including Lucchesse crime family caporegime Paul 'Paulie' Cicero (based on Paul Vario), played by Paul Sorvino, who soon recruits the teenager into his gang and later becomes a fatherly figure to him. Paulie then introduces Henry to some of the most violent mobsters in New York City; James 'Jimmy the Gent' Conway and the sociopath Tommy DeVito (based on Jimmy Burke and Tommy DeSimone), played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. The three ""goodfellas"" then begin a twenty-five year rise and fall in Mafia hierarchy.<br/><br/>This is probably the best mob movie I've ever seen and also has my nomination for a few Academy Awards! Goodfellas is as exciting as movies can get. The violence is very realistic and accelerates the flow of the movie. Martin Scorsese directs a top-notch cast whose acting is flawless. In Goodfellas, Joe Pesci plays the role of a psychopathic Italian Mafia triggerman even better than Jack Nicholson plays the psychotic writer in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining! Nobody else in the world knows the Mafia underworld better than Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pilleggi. Scorsese is truly able to portray the lifestyle of this particular organized crime group.<br/><br/>In one scene, Martin Scorsese perfectly captures the mentality of almost all Mafiosi. Tommy, Henry and numerous other gangsters are seated at a table listening to Tommy telling jokes and Henry tells Tommy that he is a funny guy. An apparently insulted and enraged Tommy asks how he is funny. Henry begins to show fear as his volatile Mafia partner acts more and more aggressive. Tommy then reveals he was only kidding with him. Henry was obviously afraid Tommy would kill him, that's the way it is. Later in the movie during a voice over, Henry states that ""People would get over arguments over nothing and before you knew it one of them was dead,"" This scene shows the paranoia and fear that all mobsters experience at some point during their careers. In a Martin Scorsese career profile called Scorsese on Scorsese, Scorsese states that the ""funny guy"" scene in Goodfellas is the most realistic segment of any of his Mafia pictures.<br/><br/>I recommend Goodfellas as an outstanding movie to all gangster, true-crime, and biopic film fans. Goodfellas is often held as the most authentic film portrayal of life in a Mafia family ever captured on screen. If you are interested in watching a good crime-drama; sit back, relax and enjoy!<br/><br/>10/10"
"TheHande","8","1","3","10 August 2007"," A very good mobster film...
","'GoodFellas' is an interesting piece. It has the mobster-romance of Godfather and the gritty reality of Scarface all in one. Yet, it is perhaps less than the sum of all its parts. Mob-films aren't typically cheery or uplifting but keeping a safe-zone where the audience isn't too bothered by all the evil things going on screen is something I really missed and something which I think The Godfather succeeded much better in accomplishing.<br/><br/>On its own the film is none the less fantastic. It feels like a twisted kind of reality where you're not exactly sure what's real and what's not. Perhaps I get a little squeamish when drugs become an element in the story but that might be just me. There is a great deal of irony in the film but it lacks the likability of The Godfather. <br/><br/>On the whole that might not be a fair comparison as Coppola's films made up a saga where as this had to wrap the mobster tale in one movie. It's definitely a great film for fans of mobster films, but not a master-piece and way too gory and bleak. On the whole I thought the performances were, none-the-less, great. Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci are amongst my favorite actors and each deliver a brilliant character to the screen."
"dragonshield","8","1","3","26 May 2007"," A movie including amazing role performances and a brilliant story but sadly being a bit dull in places
","""Goodfellas"" is Martin Scorsese's highest ranked movie over at IMDb. I had never seen it before 2 days ago and to be honest it wasn't what I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, it is all in all a great movie, but like Scorsese's movies usually it's over-hyped. ""Goodfellas"" is based on a true story and it tells a story about Henry Hill who grows up to be a gangster, a part of the mob. Along with his friends, other wiseguys Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway, the movie tells about how organized the mafia really is and follows the rise and fall of Henry Hill from the beginning till the end.<br/><br/>The movie progresses very well with the narration of Henry Hill, who's played by Ray Liotta. The narration's excellent and keeps the movie going in a good flow with it's precise use of words and witty sarcasm. I've never been so impressed of Liotta's performance than I was after this movie, he does his best role performance yet to date and does it by far. Liotta evolves the character so realistically, by emotions and doing the whole progress of the character's corruption in a so believable way. The role of Tommy DeVito is played by Joe Pesci who has always been enjoyable for me, he has that personal voice and essence which can't be compared to any actor. I've never seen Joe Pesci in such a serious role before and to me he did some fine job in it. He also does his best role performance yet to date. Then there's the mighty Robert De Niro, who plays the role of Jimmy Conway, and you can't go wrong with De Niro now can you? He is perfect for the role and to be honest the whole cast is chosen very specifically, each right actor/actress for the right role. Amazing role performances indeed.<br/><br/>The screenplay is brilliant, the story in its wholeness is a real treat for you and that's one of the reasons why you can't miss this movie. Sadly, the movie suffers from one significant problem; It's too long and that is pretty much the only reason why it doesn't deserve a 10. The first hour goes very smoothly and things keep on going all the time, you don't get bored in any part. After that it kinda stops, I wouldn't say it's downhill after that but I'd say it just stops the whole smoothness and the flow. I hate to say this, but it does get slightly too boring, hence why I said it's too long. I feel so bad because of it as this would have been a perfect movie without it being too long. The second hour just isn't nearly as interesting as the first, a real shame indeed. What comes to direction, well it's Scorsese and to me it's pretty much as excellent as it can get. You just have to admire that style of his, being oddly joyful in parts where sadness should take place. The whole soundtrack is also very Martin Scorsese stylish, not including any beautiful compositions but some really groovy and great tracks, which also play an important role in the whole progress of the movie.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" is a great movie, but for me personally it was rather disappointing. Having an average rating of 8.7 at IMDb it should be amazing, shouldn't it? Maybe the slight disappointment is because of the movie being over-hyped, yeah, most certainly. Despite it being a slight disappointment for me it's still a definite recommendation for all of you who love great movies. You don't have to like mob movies in general, as this movie gives the whole mob thing some real depth in it, giving a realistic sort of an inside-look of it. It's not phenomenal, but it's definitely a great movie."
"tsalagi-1","Null","1","3","20 January 2006"," excellent movie, but soundtrack CD is a ripoff
","the soundtrack CD for this movie could easily be a 2 or even 3 disc set, so many excellent songs left off. George Harrison's ""What Is Life"", The Rolling Stones ""Monkey Man"", (and dare I say it?) Jerry Vale (whatever song he was singing during nightclub scene with Henry and Janice), and so many others. (I'll even go out on a limb and say ""My Way"" by Sid Vicious. lol.) Few directors used music to compliment what's on the screen better than Scorcese did in this movie, and most of his others, for that matter. A perfect example is when Henry, Paulie, et al are in prison in the 1970's , and Bobby Darin's ""Beyond the Sea"" from 1960 is the background. IMHO, it's a kind of time warp, even though things ""on the outside"" have changed, and our boys are in the hoosegow, they're still living like kings.<br/><br/>All opinions welcome, as long as they are coherent. lol"

","Okay this film pretty much MADE Martin Scorsese.It is the True story of a gangster named Henry Hill.The movie starts out in the fifties and works it's way up to the early nineties.In between is a whole lotta stealing,drugs,and killing...or ""whacks"".Everyone(especially Ray Liotta) did an excellent performance in this movie.I'm a huge De Niro fan and this has to be his second best film (behind Taxi Driver).Joe Pesci plays very ill tempered Tommy DeVito.His famous ""How am I funny"" speech is awesome.Other than that I Hate pesci's character.He is an asshole throughout the whole movie.He treats everyone like dirt(or puts them in it) so when he was shot I for one applauded.Liotta,De Niro,and Pesci are these three friends who are gangsters.They start making money from drugs and that's where it goes down hill (and Bats).By the end of the movie Henry is a cocaine addict and De Niro is killing everyone....he even tries to kill Henry.So Henry rats on Jimmy (De Niro) and Boss Pauly (Paul Sorvino) and lives out the rest of his life in witness protection.<br/><br/>Overall,This film is astounding.Definitely worth a 10 outta 10.A must see especially if you like gangster films."
"Harry_Boast","9","1","3","10 March 2005"," Brilliant from start to finish
","This movie was excellent in terms of what Scorese wanted his audience to see. The way the mafia world works and how different it is in terms of normal everyday life. The start of the movie was brilliant and done in a way a mafia movie should be done, with a bit of violence. The scenes in the movie were beautifully constructed and shot, like the time Henry takes Karen out to the restaurant and Henry introduces the mafia members, like Johnny 2 time because he says everything twice. During this whole scene the camera doesn't cut which is a piece of brilliance from Scorese as it makes you feel as though you are a part of the mafia family. The acting in the movie is brilliant, Ray Liotta, Robert de Niro and the brilliant and funny Joe Pesci, also Paul Sorvino should not go unnoticed for his part. What I found incredible is that the academy failed to reward Scorese for his work in this movie and they still have not today even with The Aviator. Personally I feel this is a great injustice to a great man who has opened say many doors for the future of film."

","""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster. To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United States."" I might as well face it. I've become a huge mafia/mob movie fan. Sometime last year, when I worked at my local video store, I purchased The Godfather trilogy box set. I bought it because I felt it was just something I should have. Because I was a huge movie fan, I felt that I needed to own what was regarded as the greatest film trilogy of all time. Did I actually feel like sitting down for three hours and watching one of the movies? No way. So, it sat on my shelf for a very long time. One weekend at college, I was feeling very bored so I decided to put in ""The Godfather"" and watch it. Wow. I've been changed. This may be my favorite movie. Then came ""The Godfather Part II"" which was equal to the first one. I was captivated, because I was not used to film-making that was so consistent, raw, and powerful. Francis Ford Coppola's movies opened the door for me to see film, as well as society, in a whole new light.<br/><br/>I'm new to Martin Scorsese, but after being amazed with his movie ""The Aviator"", I decided to rent his take on the Italian underworld, ""Goodfellas"". This movie is amazing. Simply amazing, because it is an example of absolutely pure film-making that hasn't been tainted by time or the latest trends. Scorsese had plenty of opportunities to screw up ""Goodfellas"" with clichÃ©s and cheap film techniques, but he decided to stick with his roots and make a picture that was instead fueled by simple, un-adulterated ""camera on actor"" (for lack of a better term) power. Scorsese understands the language of film more than probably any other director still working today. He is amazing, because every shot that he sets up is set up for a reason. He never does anything weird simply for the sake of being weird or drawing attention to himself. Everything that he does is done to tell the story and only that. In ""Goodfellas"", Scorsese does not glorify the life of the mafia. If anything, ""Goodfellas"", is a decidedly anti-mob movie. You see everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, that goes on in this underground business. The film is very very violent, but it is never out-of-line with the story. The characters are violent men, and therefore should be portrayed that way honestly. Roger Ebert calls this ""the best mob movie ever"" and while I disagree with him there, ""Goodfellas"" has earned a very high place on that list.<br/><br/>Four stars (****)"
"katiepoppycat","Null","1","3","8 April 2004"," Okay I suppose, but didn't really do it for me
","After much hassle from the many people I know who love this film, I finally gave in to peer pressure and watched it.  I've avoided it for a few reasons, the main one being that the subject matter just doesn't appeal to me.  One of the others being that of the few Scorsese films that I have seen, I haven't liked the way he portrays women - they are usually whores, junkies or generally corrupted sad creatures.  Of course, that's also true to a certain extent of the men in his films.  I like a little more optimism in my escapism.  Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this film. Yes, it glamourised what is essentially a repellant lifestyle, but it didn't shy away from the nastier side - Henry's children witnessing the drug fuelled screaming rows, and the damage to their marriage being a notable one.  I had heard a lot about the violence in the film, but in today's climate, it didn't seem all that shocking really.  Joe Pesci was impressively scary, Robert De Niro brought out his stock character once again - i really think he has to be one of the most overrated actors in Hollywood,  He bores me rigid.  However, I did really like Ray Liotta, although, a little like De Niro, he's now made a career out of that one character.<br/><br/>It's never going to make it into my top ten, but I will allow that it's a pretty good film, and of course, that it was quite a moment in fim history."

"Rowsdower","Null","1","3","26 February 2001"," Is it really a masterpiece?
","I just had the opportunity to revisit Goodfellas after a couple years. I was captivated from beginning to end, but I need to take a somewhat controversial stand on the movie. I thinks it's good, far better than most of what Hollywood churns out, but a classic for the ages? I don't think you should go that far.<br/><br/>Here's my main problem: This movie does not contain a single likable character. All the performances are top notch, but that's not my point. I couldn't identify with Ray Liotta. I can understand how his character was seduced my the mob lifestyle, but as an adult he's no better than anyone else around him. In the Godfather, within the encapsulated mob-world with its own set of peculiar rules, the Corleones were actually good people. They respected their wives, they only killed when necessary for business, and their loyalty never wavered. It was easy for me, the audience member, to become entranced and actually cheer them on. In Goodfellas, on the other hand, all the men are essentially a--holes. De Niro is crazy and paranoid, Pesci is insecure and sadistic, and Ray Liotta may have charm, but he has no ethical compulsions (even by mob standards) and will try to get away with whatever he can. <br/><br/>I bring all this up because I need to have a character I can care about. The tragic fall of Henry is only tragic if I cared about him to begin with.<br/><br/>Secondly, I would have liked a more tangable plot. I don't mean a cookie cutter Hollywood plot, but at least give me something in the first act that gets resolved in the third. The movie plays like a series of unconnected vignettes about mob life. Yes, it's a fascinating glimpse inside the mob, but by 1990 or 91, (whenever this came out) we've already had plenty of fascinating glimpses inside the mob. When Ray Liotta gives us some talk-over narrative like ""Back then we did what we wanted and we didn't care."" I'm thinking, ""Yes Ray, we know. This isn't our first gangster movie.""<br/><br/>If this is your favorite movie, fine, I have no problem with that. Better Goodfellas than this guy back at school who once told me that Mel Gibson's ""Man Without a Face"" was his favorite movie. But give Godfather 1 or 2 another watch, and tell me if you see what I'm saying about the likability issue."

To hear the critics drooling about GF, you'd think this was better than the first two Godfathers or Casino or whatever. Well I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but it's NOT. Its too long, Ray Liotta is OK but comes off having as much Mobster credibility onscreen as Potsy from 'Happy Days'. And I didn't feel bad for him one little bit when the Feds got him and his wife.<br/><br/>The rest-DeNiro, Pesci, Sorvino-age some in this thing, which after all goes from c.53-the early 80s. But does Ray? Not from what I could see. I donno why that was, as he is about as babyfaced as Robbie Benson, its hard to tell how old the guy is, but I do know he should have shown some aging at least. Its almost as if he's stuck in the same age the whole film and watches the rest of the mob universe parade by.<br/><br/>Watch this, then see Casino-you have basically the same movie, with DeNiro and Pesci trotting out the same old characters they have each played scads of times. Yeah you hear all about DeNiro's great versatility, but c'mon-Raging Bull this ain't. He was somewhat more refined in Casino than he was here, he shot more folks in Ronin, he was loonier in 'The Fan', but I think DeNiro's just mailing it in sometimes now. Pesci goes kookoo at the drop of a hat in this, I really despised the vile scene of him shooting the young kid waiter, and wonder what Scorsese was thinking when he put that in. Don't give me that 'its what these guys do in real life, its in character' crap-that is like the equally so-violent-its-stoopid aluminum baseball bats chorus that you get to see at the finale of Casino. Overkill is overkill, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Pesci was better in JFK and Casino, but played the same kinda guy too, save in JFK Ferrie was, well....like his name sez.<br/><br/>You get the same old Scorsese bag of tricks-his folks play some minor parts, the characters narrate the goings ons, the camera work is flashy, the Mob is alternately glorified then shown for what it is, the shootings, explosions and stabbings are filmed with bravado, skill and from many angles, jest in case you happened to miss them the first time. I get the feeling when seeing Casino or Goodfellas that I'm watching a guy with a PHD in Film School showing off to all us peons. And I'm not impressed. I have seen this all before.<br/><br/>Lorraine Bracco was pretty good then kinda shelved as the film went on. Paul Sorvino was probably the best thing about the film, and he just trots out the same old 'Mean Paul' bit you can see in the 'Rocketeer' and 'Oh God', if you want my honest opinion.<br/><br/>This film was Not better than Dancing With Wolves, and therefore, was Not unfairly passed over by Oscar, despite the rantings of its many Acolytes.<br/><br/>Good movie? Sure. Great? Nahhh. Better than the Three Godfathers? Nope, save for maybe the IIIrd.<br/><br/>*** outta ****; somewhat of a big 'So What' reaction by Gazzo-2 this time out."

The person who got him involved in the gangster business is Paul Cicero, played by Paul Sorvino. After a while, Henry goes to prison and gets out. Then, after Pesci's character is a made man, the good times of Henry being an gangster begins with an killing of a man. Scorcese's film making shines in the movie. Pesci's performance as well as Bracco, Liotta and De Niro are terrific. Goodfellas is one of the best films of 1990 and it's on my Number 1 Best Film of 1990. Here, the movie never bothers to fall behind or gets dull. It's an absolute masterpiece of Scorcese's cinema. ★★★★ 4 stars."

"emperormack","10","1","4","23 January 2011"," A truly god-like masterpiece
","First off, the Academy Awards have been wrong before like with Raging Bull in 1980 or with Gangs of New York in 2002 but the Academy really screwed over Goodfellas in 1990. It received 6 nominations including Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay but it only walked away with Joe Pesci's astounding supporting actor roll. The movie starts with the narration which sort of guides you in the right direction if you don't know what the hell is going on but it is pretty hard to loose track. Ray Liotta gives the performance of his career as mobster Henry Hill who was arrested in 1980 and went into Witness Protection to save his ass from his ""pals"". Scorsese takes the gangster genre to another level with this film, he uses Thelma Schoonmaker to give the movie amazing editing which it also deserved an Oscar for. But...Robert DeNiro steals the show as Hill's close friend and mentor Jimmy Conway who is a veteran at being a thief, gunman, and hijacker. DeNiro steals the show as playing a wise guy/nice guy and a ruthless killer and lets not forget about Pesci who just plays a freakin' psycho who doesn't give a crap about human life. You screw with him, you're dead. You're nice to him, watch out cause he doesn't care. He kills for fun but he;s even crazier when insulted. Scorsese deserved a Best Director Oscar because in my life of watching many films and studying them, there is not quite a film like Goodfellas. It is the modern version of The Godfather. Excellent film and worth the 145 minutes to watch."

","After sitting down and re watching the heavyweights of the Scorsese library, a few things can be said. Taxi Driver is overrated. Raging Bull is humble and beautiful, but frankly, boring. And Goodfellas? It holds up like the pyramids. In 2010 the movie is just as powerful, just as mesmerizing and just as shocking as the first time I saw it in 1994. Few films hold their power after so many years and so many repeated viewings. But this film does and then some.<br/><br/>I don't think there's ever been a movie with an opening so shocking and absorbing. Something goes bump in the night and a lonely drive down an empty road transitions into a bloody nightmare. From here on out, you're hooked like a crack junkie.<br/><br/>Scorsese is firing on all cylinders here. Where many of his films have touched greatness in one form or another, he never before, nor since, reached the perfection of Goodfellas. Like Paulie slicing the garlic with a razor blade, so too are each of the story's ingredients added. Every performance, every camera move, every edit is perfect. They all mix for a true masterpiece. There is not one onion too many in this sauce. To call this a gangster film, is to do it injustice. Goodfellas is more than that. The Godfather is like Shakespeare. That's cool. But Goodfellas is simply Biblical and in a class of its own.<br/><br/>There is a powerful sense of vision at work here. Goodfellas is one of the best edited, best acted, best directed, best photographed and most entertaining films you will ever see."

The movies that deserve ratings of 9 and 10 engage more of the range of our emotions than this does.  This shortcoming probably has to do with the somewhat eager camera and lighting that put every scene at the same emotional distance from the viewer.<br/><br/>Frequent violence and cursing do not have to be objectionable in a film, but here they often seem wanton or voyeuristic.<br/><br/>Perhaps rather than ""cute"" I should say ""deft"" or ""neat"" or ""pat"".

"alishahmohd","6","1","5","16 May 2014"," Goodfellas - A Very slow paced film that has not aged well.
","Goodfellas is based on a book which in turn is based on a real life story of Henry Hill, a person who always wanted to be a mobster and this film tells his story about he went from being a criminal to finally turning into a rat and leaving his whole mafia life behind. <br/><br/>I think the overall storyline is very good, it is just the way it is told, too many filler scenes that are extremely, slow, boring and do nothing for the overall plot. In particular the Heist sequence was done so terribly, they introduce members of the heist and minutes later the heist ended and members started spending money, moments later they all end up dead. This whole angle was rushed and so poorly handled. . The love story between Henry and Karen was also slow and took too long to develop and the affair angle was so fast you blinked you misses it. When Henry was arrested the second time, they handled it with a series of jumbled up scenes, that could have been handled in half the time.<br/><br/>Add to that the constant and annoying narration. Scorsose likes that style of storytelling, the one with narration but it is way too much here, and occasionally they would pause certain scenes and Liotta would narrate which breaks the flow of the movie, many scenes are events are explained with narration.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta is decent in his protagonist but the other two protagonists De Niro and Joe Pesci. Pesci is fantastic and extremely charismatic as Tommy, his scenes are fun to watch and whenever he is on the screen he demands your attention, his lines are also pretty funny. De Niro does great with the amount of screen time he gets but he does not get a lot of it and allow his character to properly develop from a rationale person to a paranoid man who thinks everybody is going to get him arrested. Liotta was not bad he gave a decent performance but there are others who could have done better in his role, he is really good in some scenes, but in emotional scenes and even the funny scenes his poor acting clearly shows, his laugh is terrible and looks fake. Some great sequences regardless. The Tommy death scene and him killing a made man was one of the interesting parts.<br/><br/>Overall I don't see what is so special about Goodfellas, it is an average movie, which had a great story with potential but was told in a very average and slow manner, the narrative had tons of filler and was not handled well, the main protagonist was decent at best, leaving the other two main actors to make the most of it and carry the film and steal the show. It is definitely no Godfather.<br/><br/>Overall: 6/10."

I honestly don't care how true movies are, as I watch them for entertainment value.<br/><br/>Overall, though, I felt the movie was a decent watch, but it wasn't one that I would watch again or buy the collector's edition of."

","""I'm an average nobody...I get to live the rest of my life like a shnook."" So says Henry Hill, in one of the truly amazing denouements in film history. Here's a man who could've been easily killed off- at first by his wife, then by his own crew- and evaded it by sneaking out the 'easy' route. Yet Hill hasn't changed. He'll always complain about not having the good life anymore. The wrap-up makes totally clear what this saga is: the American dream realized as a given, and in the form of a corrupted mind-set.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is the ""if-you-put-a-gun-to-my-head"" favorite movie for me, and by that token appropriate as there are many a gun pointed at a head during the film, and sometimes with a big result (the most shocking when I first saw it, and still brutal on a big screen, is seeing Sam Jackson's brains splattered all across the room like it's some ritualistic slaughter). It's true bravura storytelling, without a single shot or moment that needs to be excised or missed. To say it's a 'perfect' movie might be overstating it; what is 'perfect', after all? Scorsese does strive for- and arguably succeeds- a kind of perfection in balancing comedy and drama, like a tightrope walker going above a bed of hot coals with a rambunctious Pesci threatening with scissors like the Oklahoma Kid. <br/><br/>You're almost afraid to laugh, and a good many times (especially if you've seen the film dozens of times like myself) you almost feel apart of the group of guys laughing about stuff that *shouldn't* be funny. But then there's what could be the greatest shot of the film, where we see a first-person of all the small-time hoods introducing themselves (""what's up guy?"" ""I'm gonna get the papers, get the papers""), where it's like we as the audience are let into the clubhouse, following them along into the back-room as they unload coats...wait, he needed suits, not coats.<br/><br/>It's endlessly watchable as a kind of raucous, dangerous pop entertainment, and it feels as though it's gone by in much briefer time than has actually passed in 146 minutes. Maybe as part of a subjective thing I can kind of relate to many of the characters, not so much because of what they do in their criminal deeds or Hill's mistress or feeding people to lions and whatnot, but the little ticks of behavior (a little note like when Hill rushes out of his coked-up girlfriend's apartment, laughing maniacally, is like any given day with my brother).<br/><br/>But a personal connection can only be so much to recommend this motion picture like no other. As one of the benchmarks of cinema of my generation it's got everything that many somewhat-to-big-time-sophisticated moviegoers look for: over-done classic scenes (""Am I a clown"" is the ""You're talking' to me"" of the movie, and probably not even as great until the ""last week this prick asked me to Christen his kid"" line), iconoclastic techniques with the camera and editing (everything from the freeze frames to the music and narration to the shots that have the intensity of coke or full on rage and adrenaline in beating a guy's face in with a gun), and performances that should be considered essential to see for anyone becoming an actor years and years from now.<br/><br/>If there was ever an American film that could absorb, entertain, enthrall, and interest me on all fronts of style and substance as much as Goodfellas does on every viewing."

","If viewers think this movie belongs in the same breath as The Godfather, they are sadly mistaken. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being best), I would rate Goodfellas a 6.0. The Godfather is an 11. The best thing going for Goodfellas is the casting of De Niro. He is perfectly cast as a tough gritty gangster. Joe Pesci should stick to comedy, i.e. My Cousin Vinny or Home Alone. Pesci is not convincing as a maniacal mobster. He is almost cartoonish. Pesci's Tommy DeVito versus Luca Brasi is a huge mismatch. Ray Liotta is mediocre as the character Henry Hill. Paul Sorvino plays his Mafia kingpin character as tongue-in-cheek. Don't compare him to Brando's Corleone. The musical score, screen play, cinematography and directing is slighly above average. AFI 2008 had this movie rated 92nd all time (way too high). BTW - they had The Godfather rated # 2 all time, one spot too low."

All of that would seem to set me up for another great movie. However, I felt it lacked the character arc that's key to a film like this. The characters lacked a certain self-awareness that could have made the movie enjoyable -- most of the film is about enjoying the spoils of mafia life. Apparently most people think this is one of Scorcese's best, which is a little bemusing to me. Maybe I was just in a bad mood this evening but I found this movie altogether skippable.

","Certainly it deserves five out of five stars, and certainly it is probably the most popular film from BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Martin Scorsese. Based on a true story, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) admits (with narration) he always wanted to be a gangster ever since he could remember, so he started hanging out with the crime family gangsters in his Italian neighbourhood to try and get somewhere. Soon enough the boss Paul 'Paulie' Cicero, based on Lucchese mobster Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) lets him help his close associate James 'Jimmy' Conway (Robert De Niro) along with young Tommy DeVito (Oscar winning Joe Pesci). As they get older they have become the most well known and ruthless gangsters with billions of dollars of cargo passing through the airport, and many heists. Because Henry and Jimmy are both Irish they cannot become a ""made man"", but Tommy can. Henry's friends become increasingly daring and dangerous, with Jimmy hijacking trucks, and Tommy with an explosive temper and psychotic violent nature. Henry in the story also meets, falls for and marries Karen (Lorraine Bracco). There are many other things I could mention in the whole story, but that'll take ages, so I'll just say that Henry and Jimmy are caught and imprisoned at one point, Tommy murders ""made man"" Stacks Edwards (a very brief Samuel L. Jackson), and when he is made one is quite quickly murdered, and in the end of the film Henry drops his gangster identity and becomes a normal ""schmuck"". Also starring Frank Sivero as Frankie Carbone, Tony Darrow as Sonny Bunz, Dumb and Dumber's Mike Starr as Frenchy, Frank Vincent as Billy Batts, Chuck Low as Morris 'Morrie' Kessler, Catherine Scorsese (Martin's real mother) as Tommy's Mother, Frank DiLeo as Tuddy Cicero, comedian Henny Youngman as himself, Gina Mastrogiacomo as Janice Rossi, Charles Scorsese (Martin's real father) as Vinnie, Suzanne Shepherd as Karen's Mother, Debi Mazar as Sandy and Michael Imperioli as Spider. Pesci is the perfect and deserved Oscar winner for his brutal, psychotics and very convincing role, De Niro and Liotta are also very good in their roles, a very good film (seeing it again)! It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Robert De Niro number 2 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was also number 50 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Al Pacino) on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 55 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments for the brilliant scene where Pesci seems to be getting madder at Liotta saying ""How am I funny? (it's scary because you don't know where it's going, till Liotta realises it's a joke of course), and it was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!"

","Even when this film was released, there were plenty of Italian mafia films to watch and enjoy. Some good, some bad, and some severely overrated. But only Goodfellas, to this day, has ever handled the subject matter with such an unforgiving amount of raw, revealing truth. This is what ""The Life"" really looks like. It's beautiful, it's enticing, but most of all, it's brutal and depressing. And this film captures all those elements perfectly without adding a bunch of circus-like, drama theater nonsense for the sake of aesthetic. Being authentic and ruthlessly accurate to the subject matter naturally forms its own unique aesthetic; one many film goers could identify with because it wasn't trying to be flashy--it was trying to be real. And by God they succeeded.<br/><br/>This film follows the rise and fall of one Henry Hill, a half Italian, half Irish mobster who got his start (as a pre-teen) in the 1950's by parking wiseguys' Cadillacs and Lincolns. His involvement only stayed innocent for a short time. Soon, he was peddling stolen cartons of cigarettes and even blowing up cars with Molotov cocktails. Although the man himself participated in activities many of us view as despicable, he never shied away from telling the truth. His honesty is admirable, and without it, it could've been decades later before we truly had a first-hand account of what it was really like being a mobster during the golden age, and the eventual downfall. Henry Hill passed away in 2012 from complications related to heart disease, one day after his 69th birthday.<br/><br/>Henry Hill is the star of the show, but he's far from a one-man band. Joe Pesci's performance as Tommy DeVito shows us how truly psychotic some of the men were in the mafia; willing to murder someone in a split second over something normal people would shrug off without a second thought. At the same time, he can be lovable and down to earth; showing us the facade many of these men could put up at a moment's notice. One moment he's brutally murdering someone, and the next he's having a pleasurable dinner with his elderly mother who's busting his chops about not settling down with a nice woman. All in the same day!<br/><br/>Lorraine Bracco plays Karen Hill; Henry's wife. Seeing her get sucked into The Life so easily is quite honestly terrifying. She couldn't have been further from what Henry was, yet the flashiness of the mobster lifestyle attracted her like cartoonish characters on the front of a cereal box would attract a grocery cart full of kids. And once she realizes how deceptive The Life can be, it's already too late. She's in. And there's no turning back.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro's performance as Jimmy Conway is quite possibly the one that sticks with me the most. He's the perfect example of how paranoia can turn you into a completely different person; causing you to flip out and cause a scene over something as banal as a man's wife wearing a nice coat after a heist. Or going to devastating lengths when you start wondering, ""Who can I really trust?"" Of course, for many true paranoids, the answer is: No one.<br/><br/>This is Scorsese at his best. While many of his films are amazing, and also 10/10's, the lightning in a bottle captured in this film will most likely never be replicated. Not by Scorsese, or anyone, for that matter. This is a film everyone should watch. It's enjoyable as all films should be, but eye-opening unlike any other."

During the play you don't have something to expect but only for the end of the movie (which is pretty long). If you miss something, no problem.<br/><br/>The performances are good, especially of the Oscar winner pesci."

","I just finished binge watching The Godfather trilogy and my expectations were high for Goodfellas. Goodfellas is not even in the same league as The Godfather Trilogy.

The movie just is not interesting and is vastly overrated. My advice, don't waste your time, the underrated Godfather 3 is a much better film."

","This is amazing.
A gangster story.
A real gangster story.
Told from the gangsters perspective, but in a fresh nice way of voiceover, where that truely fits the story.
A gangster story, underlined with an amazing track of songs.
But not just any tracks. Tracks that were totally fitting the story.
A gangster story with some of the best cinematography I've ever seen.
A story with De Niro and Joe Pesci. Ray Liottas fourth film.
They give us gold.
A story that everyone involved in knew he or she was working on a Scorsese film.
With that in mind they took the opportunity and gave the very best they could.
Scorsese.
The master himself was prepeared, he knew how to do this film and he did it that way.
He knew the shots, he did them. He knew the songs, he took them.
It is entertaining.
It is challanging.

","After watching ""Godfather"", you would expect that every mafia movie has melodramatic scenes of mafia bosses wisely talking about the meaning of life with heavily forced accents.

"mohit_sinsniwal","6","0","3","26 May 2019"," A classic mobster movie of 90's
","This is one hell of a film about the mobsters, based on a true story and coming from one of the great directors of all time. This is about Henry Hill, the narrator of the story, an Irish simple person who gets involved with the Mafia at a very young age and continues his life through it. There is no major plot in this film, just isolated incidents one of which was the turning point of Hill's life. Scorsese, as brilliant as he ever was, shows violence, sex and drugs etc in his own trademark style. And his actors helps him to make this film one of the classics.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro is not present in much of the film, nor his acting leaves too much impression. The three actors who really did their best job here are Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco. I hate to say that most youngsters today don't know too much about Liotta or how talented he was. I asked my younger brother about him and he said, ""The man who did the voice on GTA: Vice City?"". This is partly because Liotta did not get too many big roles after that, especially in recent years. But here he is just brilliant as Hill. It's Pesci's one of the best too. Playing a mad mobster with dark sense of humor wasn't his usual type. And Lorraine Bracco becomes the perfect lead female in such type of films.<br/><br/>The film's got smart screenplay and excellent cinematography. And I don't know how many times Scorsese will be denied his Academy recognition. I hate to see a lifetime achievement award as his first Oscar. But things are going like that."

"audrablum","5","0","3","29 March 2018"," Understandbly a classic, misunderstandably miserable
","This week I watched Martin Scorcese's Goodfellas (1990). I like Scorcese as a director. That being said I didn't actually care for the movie at all. Sometimes I feel like directors cross lines that for the good of society shouldn't be crossed. This movie crossed those lines. I think it was a little more gorey than it could have been. However, the gore isn't my issue. My issue was the repeated violence against women. I get that the story is being told, but I think there are other ways the information could have been conveyed. I think that the violence against the women in this movie is crossing a line and somewhat revelatory and never punished giving male viewers a sense that this is acceptable behavior to some level. It is also celebrated that the protagonist violates his monogamous commitment and is again condoned for having multiple girlfriends. I know that this isn't a family friendly movie - I get that, but I think that there should have been some real recourse for his behaviors or some reason that the audience wouldn't cheer him on for doing this. Now that my opinions are out of the way I will look at this movie from an analytical perspective in regards to the point, perspective, plot, and payoff. The point of the film was to portray the true story of a man gone gangster in the 70s, to show his life and to tell his story. This movie did an excellent job of that. The characters were built well as was the storyline. The perspective of the film was actually a dual perspective. Most of the story was told from the perspective of a boy who volunteered to join the mob and grew up living as first an inductee and then a mobster. The next perspective was that of his wife Karen as she narrates small parts of her perspective throughout the film. The plot was (as somewhat mentioned earlier) about a boy gone mobster who deals with mob life and ends up making a crucial life or death decision in the end. The payoff was probably one of the better parts of the film which was a little too long in my opinion causing the payoff to feel abrupt and out of place. All in all I can see why the film is a classic -- it does a good job telling the story and telling it well and I'm glad to have seen it. That being said I hope I never watch it again."

It was an extraordinary inside view of the underworld during the years that follows what was depicted in the Godfather... <br/><br/>About the movie, it's a good thing that the author worked on the screenplay and it's true that the narrator comments are nearly what was written... However i found that Scorcese fails to bring a visual punch in his scenes... sometimes it looks like an illustrated tale, other times, the key moments are plain because key facts have been omitted (essentially that they were always on the run to invent new scheme, that they were powerful because they corrupt a lot and that JFK was their store..) and honestly, he fails to properly build a tension!

"SeakDub","7","0","2","19 April 2017"," Average-fellas
","A true story about the New York City mobsters and the main man, Henry Hill. His rise and fall from the mob life. A film that is great in acting and storytelling of how the mobster life was like in the years ranging from 1955-1980. Great to watch for the history and what the people went through in their lives. With that said, the movie itself is just an average film which sadly shows us the fact that gangs and violence is out there in the real world.<br/><br/>The film starts great and is amazingly well done. Martin Scorsese, the man who does very violent/crime/mob movies. And don't forget the profanity, this movie drops the F bomb. All together it doesn't affect the film. But nonetheless the movie takes you through the years with the mob family. The first act is well done, especially with meeting the characters. The second act fell flat and boring. It doesn't really hold your attention. Making you want the film to just hurry up and end. And when the end comes along it just leaves you feeling ""okay."" There is no big surprising moments, no memorable scenes. The dialogue on the other hand, plenty of famous lines. <br/><br/>The acting was grand. Joe Pesci always outdoing himself. While again Robert De Niro does such an amazing job in his character portrayals. With Ray Liotta playing the lead role of Henry Hill who was perfect. Featuring many other actors and actresses who did such an awesome job on the film. And a surprise cameo of a young Samuel L Jackson! The list of actors and actresses was well picked for the film and everyone did a masterpiece. <br/><br/>The story which is told from Henry and his wife's perspective. While again the film is pretty violent, it shows how it can put a toll on someone. From getting involved in fights, killings, drugs, and the overall mafia life. Eventually you are going to snap. But the way the story is told is like a long boring dull tone. Like a boring history lesson. A slow paced story. How the story is told of what really happen is just what you may read in a biography book. It is average, entertaining if you like that sort of thing. Not saying Scorsese did a bad job on the movie. ""Goodfellas"" just feels overrated. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is a straightforward average film. Ranging from the beginning to interesting to the ending being plain. Not a must see but if you got the time or like the mafia style films then go for it. Otherwise skipping this film will give you time to find another movie that is worth it. A greater movie suggestion would be another one of Scorsese's film, ""The Departed."""

","What a feeling of fulfillment when you beat the system. The thrill of getting away with something with the presence of malice. Back in the 1970's I met a friend in Junior College who was a huge hockey fan. He lived in East Meadow, New York adjacent to the Nassau Coliseum which was the home arena for the New York Islanders ice hockey team. My friend wasn't made of money yet he attended all the home games. He invited me to one and I witnessed his underhanded operation of sneaking in to games. It didn't stop there. Not only did my friend sneak me inside,, He would go right back out and bring other people inside for a small fee. The patrons were not promised a seat but at least they had entrance and could watch by sitting in the aisle and hallways throughout the hockey match. The ticket takers were in on the scam as well. These employees of the coliseum were basically moonlighting for a second income. Our personal ticket taker was a Math teacher, we called him Mugsy. My friend was in his eighth grade math class. That's how the money making operation started. Between the second intermission we would meet at gate #9 and dive up the loot we collected and the scheme was born. We were thinking small so we expanded to all events rock concerts and basketball etc. We had it all and enjoyed the profits. Goodfellas is about a journey through the eyes of an impressionable young Henry Hill (Chris Serrone). We follow his journey into the underworld from his deficient living conditions in a poor Brooklyn Neighborhood watching his Father struggle financially, taking the Subway to work. From his bedroom window Henry discovered a new and exciting world watching the Mobsters at the Taxi stand across the street. He saw these fellows in business suits who parked their cars anywhere they wanted . Played card all hours of the night and controlled the neighborhood more efficiently than the cops with numbers and betting sheets. Henry was introduced to Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino) the head of the crew. Paulie had his hand in everything from high jacking trucks and stealing precious cargo at Idlewild Airport. Henry would accompany his rotund Brother Tuddy (Frank DiLeo) who also ran the neighborhood pizzeria. Henry worked himself upward in this world of gangsters. Henry was so involved that he quit going to school. One day Henry's Father received a letter from the school that Henry hasn't attended in months. A ballistic Mr. Hill beat up his son giving him a black eye. Henry intern went to Toody and said he has to quit. Toody and some fellows waited in front of the local post office for Henry's Mailman to return from his route. Henry Picked out the postman and they grabbed him and throw him in the back of their car drove over to the pizzeria and put his head in the oven. No more letters from school, No more letters to the house. It got so bad that Henry's Mother had to go down to post office and ask for her bills. To earn his keep and acclaim to the mob Henry would vandalize cars, sell bootleg cartons of cigarettes and accompany Tuddy on using outside telephones. Bar tending for Paulie in which he meets an out of control Jimmy Conway (Robert DiNero). Jimmy takes a shine to the young delinquent. Henry watched how Jimmy carried himself by hijacking trucks and downright stealing. Jimmy teams Henry up with another helper Tommy DeVito. Henry wins over the trust and honor of the mob by a recent bust by the FBI as they grab Henry for selling illegal cigarettes. Henry is acquitted of all charges from being a first time offender. Henry thought he failed them by getting caught but Jimmy tells a teary eyed boy the facts about loyalty. He didn't rat on his friends by not saying anything and telling them nothing as he slips a bill in his shirt pocket to the ovation and delight of the gaudy clad mobsters. Henry grows into adulthood Played now by Ray Liotta,working mostly with Tommy Played now by Joe Pesce working the airport and planning a huge heist. It was a glorious time with wiseguys and mobsters everywhere . One of my favorite scenes in this movie is the regular frequented mob restaurant as Henry narrates all the wiseguys in the joint. From Nicky Eyes,Pete the Killer, Freddy No Nose, Anthony Stabile and who could forget Jimmy Two Times. This movie continues through the corrupt life and slow down word spiral of organized crime through the eyes of Henry Hill. From his first big score to his marriage to Karen (Lorraine Bracco), his carousing and brief stint in the joint. Finally dealing in cocaine with his Pittsburgh connection. Honorable mention to actor Chuck Low as the Wig salesman/bookie Morris Kessler who I found very amusing throughout his scenes. Joe Pesce also with a violent performance along with Robert DiNero makes this an addiction in watching the wiseguys do their stuff. The film is enticing to any impressionable kid who wants life in the dangerous lane. The editing and period music adds to the charm of the life of the Goodfellas who had it all for the taking, so they thought! Meanwhile we used the Coliseum for
profit at least 10 more years before we were caught sneaking people inside. Our operation was finally shut down and an expensive court case followed as we were fined with malicious mischief plus lifetime banishment from the Nassau Coliseum."

Future Sopranos standout Lorraine Bracco also got her fame here, the part that paved her way for the future role on the hit TV series.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie works down to every shot, edit, music, and lighting choices. Really, the only downside is that some of the source material is dark and violent; but it's based on the true story of Henry Hill, who spent his entire life in the mafia. This is what it was really like, and Scorcese does a fine job keeping it entertaining and realistic.<br/><br/>Scorcese delivers a master class on filmmaking here. Problem is, nobody is ever going to match it; they'll just be too busy watching in awe at how untouchable his level of mastery is. Goodfellas is easily one of the top 5 crime dramas ever made, probably more like top 3, and arguably the best crime drama ever made. A must see classic.<br/><br/>10/10"

","One of the greatest mobster films of all time. Lorraine Bracco is so hot in this film and does a superb acting job. Ray Liotta is a perfect mobster. DeNiro...yea... but Pesci makes this film. Just like all the Gangster films he is in. Without Pesci the film would be lacking its magic. There is just no one that can be a substitute for Joe Pesci. This film is memorable. People make quotes from this film every day. ""Do I amuse you"". This film makes most guys want to go out and join the mob or be part of something similar. This to me is one of Martin Scorsese's best films he has ever made. I love that he puts his mother in the film. She was so great as Pesci's mom. Wish I could have her cook for me."

","As far back as I can remember, I've never wanted to be a gangster. I'd crack under the pressure and would probably wind up getting whacked (I've not a drop of Sicilian blood in me either, so would never be a 'made' man). I'm far safer sat here at my Mac typing film reviews.<br/><br/>Real life mobster Henry Hill (portrayed by Ray Liotta), on the other hand, had always wanted to be a 'wiseguy', and lived the dream to the full, making all the right connections and bags of cash in the process, at least until his greed got him into trouble with mob bosses and he was forced to turn state's evidence to save his skin.<br/><br/>As directed by Martin Scorsese, this account of Hill's exploits is extremely gripping stuff, with great period detail, a superb soundtrack, and a standout cast (including Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino and Joe Pesci) all putting in great performances, Pesci in particular giving it all as loose cannon Tommy DeVito, one of the scariest characters ever committed to film (his classic 'funny like a clown?' scene is unbearably tense). The film is also incredibly violent, showing the harsh reality of the 'business' in unflinching detail, opening as it means to go on with the brutal stabbing and shooting of some poor sap in the trunk of a car.<br/><br/>Nope a life of crime is definitely not for me. Now what shall I review next?"

","I enjoyed this movie very much. It was very sincere and had a one- hundred percent believable story-line. I respect that a lot. It even made it more believable because of the settings time era. During this time, events that the movie portrayed probably had occurred. Nothing was too much of a negative eye-roller in this film, which is a plus. Actually it's a surprise. Most gangster movies, at least in my experience, have stretched a story-line a little too far to create unneeded excitement or thrill. <br/><br/>The Italian gangsters were the ""balls"" back in this time period. They ran everything. I liked how this movie took a gangster movie and weaved a thread of drama through the story. It made it a very genuine and believable story of hard gangster mobster life, clashing with love. <br/><br/>They even abide by the old mobster rules of "" never kill a made-man without permission, or without being made yourself."" Joe learned this the hard way at the end of the movie. The whole movie is a ride, and it followed the ways of change as well. I will recommend this movie to ANYONE for a movie you could watch MORE than once."
"chrishavluciyan","9","0","1","17 October 2016"," For those who like good storytelling - and gangsters
","Goodfellas is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Despite the fact that I haven't seen many gangster movies I was impressed by Scorcese's masterpiece.<br/><br/>The film deals with a child whose only dream - which later comes true - is to become a gangster. Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who is 10 or 12 at the time, starts working at a cab station where his relationship with the Italian American mafia starts to grow. He starts doing whatever he wants, stealing and skipping school, and eventually becomes a real mobster. This is the story of Henry becoming a big name in the mafia with lots of ups and downs.<br/><br/>It has great storytelling aided by an innovative voice-over. Some say that voice-over is a lazy way of storytelling but I say that is BS – at least when it comes to this movie. The voice belongs to the main character, Henry Hill. He tells his story in detail and it feels like he is talking to a friend when he is talking to us - his speech is emotional and makes you feel with the characters. In one scene, everything stops and the voice-over becomes alive when Henry faces the camera and talks directly to the viewer. Cool, right?<br/><br/>No need to comment on the performance of the amazing cast: Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino, Frank Sivero... <br/><br/>Long story short, it's a movie you'll always remember."

","Outer Galactic is the best way I can describe how Martin Scorsese 's movies make feel and think. Although many of his movies are based on true stories, the manner in which he delivers each production is insanely genius. His ability to incorporate every possible human detail, taking his audience on a real life engaging journey is simply out of this world. I have a feeling he has been making movies in his past life and will continue to do so in his next life. Might I add, I can watch ""Goodfellas"" a billion times and have a new experience each time.

","This movie is an all time classic starring Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta and directed by Scorsese....What's not to love! It is a perfect movie about the Mafia and Henry Hill. It is based off the book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi which is a book I have read recently and is also amazing. Ray Liotta's acting mixed with Robert De Niro's and Joe Pesci's really sets this movie over the edge. The chemistry between the three guys is off the chart and I personally think that this is Scorsese's best work. Casino is a close second. A lot of people seem to think that The Godfather is a better movie but I personally think that Goodfellas is far superior and deserves more credit as it is brilliant. This movie also has a performance by Samuel L Jackson too. Many people do not know that."

","What can I say, this movie sparked my whole interest in the gangster/mafia genre. In my opinion it is the best film I have ever seen. I was gripped from the opening scene, a very iconic opening which sets the tone for the whole movie. The performances from each of the actors are excellent with Joe Pesci deserving a special mention with an outstanding performance with the HAHA scene being an incredible watch alone. (he picked up the best supporting actor oscar for this role) It's very difficult not to fall in love with ""film"" in general after watching this movie, for me the direction of the film is absolutely magnetic, gripping you throughout the highs and the lows of the gangster lifestyle. The characters can be despicable at times but you can not feel empathy at times as the characters go up and down over the course of the story. I would say this film and Raging Bull is Scorsese at his very best. To some up I would describe this movie as a young men following all they knew to succeed in life but ultimately darkness..as it often does finds a way to prevail!"

Scorsese finds a perfect balance because when something big hits them, we don't feel to bad when they get what they deserve.<br/><br/>The narration is a stroke of genius as Henry Hill takes us through a long walk through his mob life. Ray Liotta was great, as was Joe Peschi and Robert De Niro. This movie benefits from a very talented cast, which is something you get with Scorsese.

"tczech9","9","0","1","21 July 2016"," A Mob Movie for the Ages
","This ballad of New York City gangsters began with a bang. The opening scene portrays a bloodied, blinded victim tied up in the trunk of a car. My first thought was ""how are they going to top this?"" Nonetheless, Martin Scorsese and the entire production crew continued to leave the audience in shock and awe. The fact that this movie is based off of horrifically true events makes it that much more unnerving and thus entertaining. The film dives deep into the nooks and crannies of mafia culture, sparing no harsh details, regardless of the brutality. Many people that have seen this film have complained about ""lazy screen writing"" due to the vast usage of profanity, however I have come to the conclusion that the f-bombs added an element of truth to it. What many don't understand, is that this film was created to open eyes and unveil the ugly face of mafia and crime in early 60's America, and during that time, in the midst of their fugitive culture, this is the type of language that gangsters and hustlers would have and do use. For that reason, it makes sense to include and even glorify the sailor's mouths of the characters. Another thing that many conservative audiences did not enjoy was the frequent scenes of drug/alcohol abuse throughout the film. Again I repeat: this is necessary to include when creating a purposeful movie about the mob. Furthermore, this is based primarily off the life of the main character, Henry Hill, who did experience the events in the film truthfully. As hard as it is for some of us to fathom, ignorance in the face of the body, in essence substance abuse, is very common in the subcultures of our country, the Mafia being the most notorious of these subcultures. Overall, the film was very true to life, entertaining, and well made. Camera work was prestigious, using 28mm lenses to create a retro aura, whilst the images staying true to the work and very polished and clean. The acting was beyond expectation. Ray Liotta as Henry Hill was a very good choice, pinning the role as if he were actually Hill, not to mention DeNiro and Pesci's performances as bloodthirsty mob-men, which were certainly Oscar worthy. Final decision: 9/10."
"filipemanuelneto","10","0","2","9 July 2016"," An anthology film
","This movie revolves around Henry Hill, an American gangster, and the route he did within the restricted circles of organized crime. Directed by Martin Scorsese, it has a Nicholas Pileggi script and a cast headed by Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci. The film was nominated for six Oscars, winning only one of them (Best Supporting Actor).<br/><br/>This is a cult film for lovers of gangster movies. Based on real events, the film shows us a lot about the inner world of the Mafia and can transport the audience into the world of organized crime with great ease. It has an excellent script, which focuses its attention on the brutality of the men, and the superficiality of appearance of lives that crime allowed them to bear. All the actors were at the highest level but Joe Pesci exceeded expectations giving his character the soul of a true psychopath, with very strong action scenes. In fact, all the action scenes in this movie are intense, but they are even better for never losing realism and do not seem too far-fetched. De Niro achieved in this film, one of the most careful and well-achieved interpretations of his entire career to date. Much of the film's success is due to the painstaking efforts of Scorcese, a committed director who likes to make exceptionally good films. The photography is excellent, quite dark at times, which helps to capture the most tense moments of the film. All visual effects and sound were made carefully and look good on the screen."
"ryan-bfd","10","0","1","1 July 2016"," There will never be another Goodfellas
","Goodfellas is a one of a kind film. That feels kind of strange to write considering that this film has been repeatedly attempted to be copied. The narration, the fourth wall breaks, the over-the-top violence; it all seems like a cliché in the ""true-crime"" genre. Blow, Casino, The Wolf of Wall Street, Donnie Brasco and many more films have tried to capture the same essence that Goodfellas had back when it was released in 1990. But, in this film-lover's humble opinion, they have all failed. That's because Goodfellas holds a style and atmosphere all of its own. But in the minds of the Hollywood ""big-wigs"", if something works once then it must work a dozen more times. Which is why every year we get an eye-rolling remake of a movie that was just fine when it came out. As I am typing this a remake of the 1959 classic Ben-Hur is about to be released. A film that won a record eleven Oscars is being remade! And, needless to say,many, including myself, do not think this film will hold up in comparison to its predecessor. Anyways, I think that the same thing is happening with Goodfellas in a more indirect way. I don't think that it will ever be remade frame-by- frame, but stylistically, it has been remade a dozen times, including a few times by Scorsese himself. It feels like every time Scorsese releases a new film it is trying to top Goodfellas, but no matter how good his films get, they never do. Goodfellas is his crowning achievement and it always will be. Because you can't remake Goodfellas, you can only come close. The acting, the camera movement, the cinematography, the lighting, the writing, and the overall unapologetic grit all come together to make a cinematic masterpiece and one of the best crime films of all time. I'm not saying that this film is better than The Godfather, but if you made that argument, many film-buffs would have a hard time debating you. Joe Pesci's Oscar- winning performance is just one of the many great highlights of this film. Jaw-dropping aggression, unchained violent nature, and unmercifully abhorrent personality highlight the surrealistically vicious world of Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta). That and his narration which sounds more like reminiscence rather than straight-forward storytelling. Henry Hill describes his time in the mob in a musing tone as if to show admiration for his sinful past-life. Say what you will about how the true story actually relates to the film, but there is no denying that this film captured the spirit of Henry Hill and the mafia lifestyle. And that's what a good film based on a true story does. A biographic film is by no means a frame-by- frame record of every factual event that happened in an individual's life, but rather an homage that sums up that person's life and what impact it had on other people. Even if it was a negative impact, it can still make for a d****-good story. I could write about this movie for a hundred more paragraphs talking about Scorsese's decision in camera movement, the amazing performances given by the various actors and actresses (Robert De Niro, Ray Liota, Lorraine Bracco, Frank Vincent, even Samuel Jackson's small role), the way that the screenwriter, Nicholas Pileggi, nailed the character narration, fourth wall breaks, and witty dialogue just right, and a bunch of other elements that bring this film together so beautifully. But, to be honest, you wouldn't want to read that much text anyways. So, I will leave it up to the film to show you what I mean. And if you haven't seen this film yet, STOP READING THIS AND WATCH IT NOW. Seeing it is always better than talking about. You won't regret it. Even if you do, you can still be glad that it was made. Without Goodfellas, there would be no Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire, Pulp Fiction and any of your favorite TV shows or movies that were influenced by this movie. Goodfellas isn't just a film, it helped make film what it is today."

","A contemporary classic stylishly directed by Martin Scorsese, it's among his finest two plus hours (and that's really saying something coming from the man who brought us Taxi Driver & Raging Bull!). He once again teams with Robert De Niro to bring this amazing tale of New York City's organized crime syndicate in the late 70's to life. The supporting cast includes Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco and Joe Pesci (in the scene-stealing performance that won him the Oscar). The use of the oldies pop/rock soundtrack has often been imitated but never duplicated (though Pulp Fiction would be a comparable comparison). Scorsese's dramatization of Henry Hill's life as a gangster shows us the seduction, the allure and ultimately the sickness and fatalistic consequences of living the life as a somebody in a world of nobodies.<br/><br/>Though Goodfellas is categorized as an action movie and does contain the requisite number of fights, explosions, etc. it's actually much more finely nuanced and psychologically complex than what you'd normally expect from this genre. Joe Pesci delivers an equally powerful performance as sociopath Tommy DeVito. Tommy is so remorseless that he casually discusses cooking while burying one of the unfortunate victims of his lightning-quick temper. It's Tommy's non-chalant that makes him so frightening.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."

"saymaraza","10","0","2","26 March 2016"," Goodfellas review
","My interpretation on Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' is a conflict between Joe Pesci & the other gangsters. The other gangsters being De Niro, Ray Liotta, Paul Sorvino and briefly Frank Vincent. This film is an absolute master piece in the making! one of my favourite ideas to the movie is the way that it was shot. In one particular scene where the camera follows Ray Liotta through a kitchen and eventually ends up in a night club. The only reason they did this was because the main entrance was closed at the time. As this scene was slightly improvised and changed at last minute, this happened to be one of the most memorable scenes for me. There are so many superb scenes within the film, another being Joe Pesci in the ""funny how' scene. Pesci's character Tommy Devito was spot on! Every scene he was in left it tense and thrilling, and with a purpose. He is what made the movie a masterpiece! I have loved many Scorsese films over the years, but this by far stands as the best in my opinion."
"schroeder-gustavo","10","0","1","5 March 2016"," Masterpiece
","Goodfellas is what I would call a masterpiece, a wonderful movie and a representation of everything I love about movies. It's a movie I have loved pretty much all my life and I just had the privilege to experience it in a theater, so I'll do my best to explain why Goodfellas is not just an ordinary crime film and why it's one of the greatest movies ever made for me.<br/><br/>There are so many movies about crime and gangsters and many before Goodfellas and this movie is often considered as the best mob movie ever made next to The Godfather. One the things that makes Goodfellas so good is the way it shows the gangster life and how it can be so attractive. We follow Henry Hill since he was a kid and he explains throughout his journey how ""being a gangster was better than being president of the United States"" Henry never had to wait for anything, he got what he wanted every time and he loved it. He explains how he thought people that worked every day just to get a paycheck had no balls. It's interesting because it shows why so many people join the mob in the first place, no matter how ugly it may seem. But one thing the film never does and it's also a reason why it's so great, is that it never glorifies the life of a gangster. Scorsese makes sure the audience feels how filthy and dangerous it is and how awful the people that live it can be. This is something Goodfellas excels at.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is also probably the most fast paced movie I have ever seen. The editing is amazing, but it's never confusing and this movie may be a lot of things but it is certainly not a boring film. It's an extremely entertaining and engaging film. The performances are just amazing and you get to know every main character. Joe Pesci won the Oscar for his performance, of course, but Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro are just great in the film. The cinematography is great and the movie just has Scorsese written all over it. His directorial choices are so evident in the film and they are beautiful. The combination of soundtrack and the film is beautiful and perfect. I love every bit of the movie but two of my favorite scenes are the steadicam shot when Henry takes Karen to the Copacabana and when Robert de Niro decides to kill Morty with Sunshine of Your Love playing intensely. <br/><br/>The fast pacing of the film works very well because if you pay attention, you will realize the pacing gets faster as the movie advances. This is paralleled with how Henry starts to lose control over his life through drug addiction, sloppiness (as he gets caught) and cheating on his wife. In the end we realize how deranged these people really are. Tommy (Pesci) is a psychopath, Jimmy (Robert de Niro) acts as a father figure and close friend to Henry most of the film and in the end he tries to get him (and probably his wife, too) killed. Henry rats everyone out and he doesn't even feel sorry for it. He feels sorry because he can't live the life anymore. He has to ""wait around like everybody else"" The audience realizes how dull and boring a ""regular"" life can be and we understand why he lived the life he lived. Scorsese never tries to moralize the actions of these people, but he makes sure we understand them. <br/><br/>For me, the movie is pretty much flawless. You could argue that there are too many freeze frames, but they all work. Also, you could argue that it's crazy that Henry's character is 21 years old at a point in the film when he looks 40. Think about it, though. If it was played with different actors the movie would not have the same effect and it would degrade the film. And remember, the movie plays out over a course of 30 years. This was the best way of shooting the movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Goodfellas is a must watch for any film lover. A classic and a masterpiece. <br/><br/>10/10"

""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"" The performances from Liotta and De Niro are some of the best of they're careers but Joe Pesci just stole the show with an amazing and memorable acting. Other actors with the performance of they're career should also be referred, like Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino. This movie also features one of the most incredible soundtracks of movie history with The Rolling Stones, Derek and the Dominos and even Sid Vvicious bringing some musical perfection to the Scorsese's masterpiece. This is not a movie you forget watching, it's a film that will change your perspective on Wiseguys, pride and fall. For those reasons and some others I recommend this film, my personal favorite of all time to all movie watchers around the world and expect your mind to be blown away by Martin Scorsese and his gang."

","Scorsese takes on the life of mobster Henry Hill in this wild entertaining and voice-narrative driven film that even surpasses the Godfather. Quick cutting, perfect tracking shots, excellent cast, violent, funny and disturbing at the same time. A perfect film that got snubbed at the Oscars! Joe Pesci makes a career best as a trigger happy psycho and Ray Liotta has never been better in anything before or since. It moves so fast but never looses focus on the story and is probably the closest we ever come to real crime on screen. In classic Scorsese style the soundtrack is superbly realized and ends with the cynic Sex Pistols version of Frank Sinatras My Way that perfectly sums up the movies dark take on the American dream. A masterpiece that ranks among the best."

","And so from the opening narrative from Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta) thoughts, he has always had that dream to become a gangster. Claiming that it was far better than being President of the United States. This was the beginning of a long-line of intriguing narratives of Martin Scorsese's brilliant character-study of Mafia life in 1990's ""Goodfellas"". Based on actual events we follow Italian-Irish kid Henry Hill from his humble beginnings to when he became ignited into an Italian crime family as we see him work his way through heists and his in-and-out prison systems to his drug trafficking empire. While this is happening, Hill's life and relationships were becoming more complicated for him to handle, he has to decide on whether he wants face death from his Mafioso allies or take his seat on the witness protection program. Behind all these enthralling events, Scorsese manages to add a myriad of colorful characters which has a benchmark filled with violence, humour, dedication, loyalty and finally the ultimate of all prices, betrayal. <br/><br/>The other notable performances comes from Robert De Niro as decorated criminal mind Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway and Joe Pesci as the diminutive and equally short-tempered assassin Tommy DeVito who seems to be branded by a cornucopia of psychological disorders. Devito combines both the catalyst to both the gratuitous violence in the movie as well as most of the dark humour as well. And nobody combines both dark humour and violence better than Scorsese. Who can forget the the memorable ""what's so funny about me"" scene which has a preceding story that is filled with sharp humour that follows later with intense dialogue only to followed by some friendly humour which leads to unexpected violence. It's classic scenes like this that make this movie so unpredictable and yet very magical. <br/><br/>With a cesspool of talented performers, you could easily get lost in the shuffle, and that's exactly what happened to Ray Liotta here. I'm not saying he was terrible in his leading performance here as gangster wannabe Henry Hill. It's just that of all the major characters starring here, his was the lesser convincing compared to his costars. His narration lacked the integrity of a cold-blooded gangster, but more like a literature student contemplating on finishing his Master's thesis on gangs in New York. The weight carriers in this film depends mostly on the performances of De Niro and Pesci as they embody the emotions and the intrigue which makes the film very believable and at the same time rich in very specific detail. They're respected roles are the reasons to watch this movie because they're more fun to watch than Henry Hill who at times felt more like an observer as opposed to being part of the action like what De Niro and Pesci do. But with the characters and the dynamics within them are very satisfying and sure Liotta was great in his role and his narration does embody a man who seems to be feared of what he got himself into and how to get out if there is a way out without being dead. <br/><br/>Rounding out the supporting cast I thought the chemistry between Liotta and Lorraine Bracco as Henry's Jewish wife Karen Friedman Hill was really special. The trials and tribulations of this dysfunctional married couple added great depth to the story was an important part of the film. It shows that unlike other gangster films, there is family life provided there and it steps out of the inner circle of gangster films which makes it all reason you can't miss out on a film like this one. However, unlike Francis Ford Coppola who's ""Godfather"" movies used a more glorified side to the mob life, Scorsese took his direction out in the mean streets of Brooklyn and makes the disjointed relationship between Henry and Karen all the more realistic. Scorsese once said that all good films are there to teach us the lessons of life. ""Goodfellas"" gives us a hard lesson about respect, dedication, betrayal, assets and liabilities. <br/><br/>When all's said and done, ""Goodfellas"" stands strong in terms of performances, cinematography, direction and writing. This movie is probably the greatest gangster films in the history of cinema. Even though it has some flaws, the movie does a great job in not only looking at the dark side of gangster life, but it demonstrates how good storytelling operates. A fine example of Scorsese's direction can easily be summed up near the end as Henry and Karen enter into the Copacabana as the go through the halls. They go past the club and past the kitchen and into a dining area where they are being seated at a table with waiters to serve them. I can't recommend this film enough, it's a wonderful movie, not just for gangster fans, but for people who appreciate good cinema."
"harveybdickens","9","0","1","29 January 2016"," Martin Scorsese's Best Movie
","Martin Scorsese is considered one of the best modern directors out there, and it's easy to see why with films such as Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980), and The Departed (2006.) But it's THIS film that's considered his best directorial effort. I agree whole heartedly with this statement because, while The Godfather (1972) is considered to be the best mafia movie of all time, Goodfellas is the most accurate mafia movie out there.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Henry Hill, a real life gangster who ""as far back as he can remember has always wanted to be a gangster."" Henry narrates the movie, and describes what he loves about the gangster world. The gangster world, which is portrayed in a very realistic manner, will become part of his life for the next 25 years. While in real life his character wouldn't be very likable, he is portrayed as likable...for a gangster. One cannot say the same for his colleague Tommy DeVito.<br/><br/>During his life as a gangster Henry goes through all the things gangsters go through: Drinking, drugs, murder, jail etc. His character progresses mainly through the fact that, in the early parts of the film, he is carefree, reckless, and, at times, a little obnoxious. At the end of the film he is far more cautious, cares more about those around him, and even turns on his fellow gangsters and sends them to jail, despite knowing that he will never be a gangster again.<br/><br/>What adds impact to the story is the fact that Henry Hill was a real person, who committed real crimes, and who worked for real gangsters. It is the perfect glimpse into the mafia world, much like The Godfather before it, and as a result; I give it 9/10"

","Martin Scorsese is one of the most iconic film directors of all time. From Raging Bull to Shutter Island, from Taxi Driver to Wolf of Wall Street, he has done it all. Scorsese also played a big part in the success of actors such as Robert de Niro, Joe Pesci and Leonardo DiCaprio. In his career of 23 feature length films, for me, it is the 12th movie, I think is his best; GoodFellas. So, let me review two hours and twenty-seven minutes full of swearwords, drugs, violence and Rolling Stones music.<br/><br/>GoodFellas is about Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta), a New Yorker sucked into the mafia-business at a very young age. The viewer experiences a span of three decades, in the life of Hill and his gangster colleagues Jimmy Conway (played by Robert de Niro), Tommy DeVito (played by Joe Pesci), Paul Cicero (played by Paul Sorvino) and more, in the mafia. The movie is based on the true story, of Henry Hill. Hill said himself that the film depicts his life in the mafia very accurately. The script and dialog in the different scenes is very good and humorous.<br/><br/>The acting in GoodFellas is brilliant. Liotta plays his role excellently and delivers his voice-overs fantastically. However, it is the acting by de Niro and Pesci, which is one of the things, that make this film so special. Pesci's intense and choleric acting even earned him an Oscar for Best Actor in a supporting role. Lorraine Bracco, who plays Karen Hill, Henry's wife, also plays her role well, but not quite with the excellence, like the before mentioned actors.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of this film is very interestingly structured. It starts with music from the sixties, where also the plot begins. It moves alongside the story up until the eighties. Typical for Scorsese, the soundtrack has many songs from the Rolling Stones, but also features Eric Clapton among other artists. The music in GoodFellas is overall very well picked and fitting.<br/><br/>GoodFellas is my favorite gangster/mafia film, due to an amazing story, funny dialog and monologue, superb acting and good music. It is also my favorite Scorsese film, my second favorite nineties film and my third favorite movie of all time 10/10"

","This movie is probably one of the greatest gangster movies that ever existed. But what more can you expect from the legendary Martin Scorsese? Goodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill, a rebellious kid who dreams of becoming a respected gangster, fascinated by the glorious mafia lifestyle. In his early teens, his dream comes true and he joins the mafia. The film depicts Henry's life in the mafia and all of its ups and downs. Feared Jimmy Conway and psychopathic Tommy DeVito are Henry's friends and allies throughout the film which eventually ends with deceit, betrayal and death. Goodfellas is a movie that I definitely recommend to everyone to watch it. Tip: Before watching the film, read the book ''Wiseguy'' by Nicholas Pileggi."

","Good fellas is the best movie. And it it is the master piece for all gangster movies . till now i have watch this count less times. henry hill i like this character . everyone done the great job. my all time favorite movie. ""Being a gangster is better than being a president of united states...."" what a dialogue.. kick ass.<br/><br/>""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.<br/><br/>Gangsters are all around us. Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. ""Goodfellas""--based on true events--explores the lives of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the Mafia at a young age and continues his ""career"" throughout the film.<br/><br/>As he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mob boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino); and he is friends with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a calm, steady gangster; and Tommy (Joe Pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems. <br/><br/>Eventually Henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to drug abuse and paranoia, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a tour the force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as Jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in ""Goodfellas,"" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. ""What do you want, f&*^&?"" the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely Paul Thomas Anderson in ""Boogie Nights"") and there's a reason: it's great stuff. He totally deserved to receive Best Director in 1990, but of course he didn't. (Rumor has it the Academy frowns on Scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work. Oh, get over it.)"
"brianberta","9","0","1","6 November 2015"," One of the best gangster films ever made
","""The Godfather"" is usually called the greatest gangster film ever made. Several films such as ""Scarface"", ""The Godfather Part 2"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"", and ""Pulp Fiction"" are rivals to that movie. To me, ""Goodfellas"" definitely ranks very high up there. I love both ""The Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas"" and I think that both films are masterpieces.<br/><br/>This movie follows infamous gangster Henry Hill and his friends as they work their way up in the gangster world. It shows different people and different events he encounters in this film.<br/><br/>I just want to start off this review by saying that this movie is incredibly entertaining. It keeps the movie going at an enjoyable pace and it makes the movie very easy to follow. The movie even draws you in right at the beginning with its brilliant opening scene which is now iconic.<br/><br/>By far, Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) is my favorite character in this movie. He is threatening and he seems like the kind of guy that you don't want to mess with. He can lose his temper very easily and if someone annoys him even in the slightest way possible, they risk getting themselves shot and killed. The infamous ""Funny How?"" scene near the beginning is definitely one of the most tense scenes in all of cinema history. The audience is left wondering if he'll pop and the silence of the scene makes it more tense. In other words, he basically steals the show.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta also gave a fantastic role as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a feeling of innocence all while having a feeling of violence to him. He also loses his temper easily and when he does, those scenes stick with you very long after viewing it.<br/><br/>Also, Robert De Niro gave a great performance. Robert De Niro has always been one of if not my favorite actor of all time. I like him for his tough guy roles. In my opinion, his performances in ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"" are some of the best performances ever in cinema. He gave another phenomenal performance in this movie as well even though he's not in the movie as much as you'd expect him to be based on the DVD cover.<br/><br/>This movie is based on the true story of Henry Hill and it is adapted from the best-selling book ""Wiseguy"". The book is great but the movie blows it out of the water in every way imaginable. Also, Henry Hill himself actually stated that this movie is about 95% accurate.<br/><br/>Also, the movie is very stylish with its dazzling cinematography. The cinematography looks so good mainly because of the lighting and realistic set design in it. On top of that, Scorsese's Copa Cabana shot is a fabulous shot and it has a lot going for it in terms of the long take.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie hits all the right notes and it is contains everything which I think is mandatory in gangster films. It is easy to follow, it has enjoyable pacing, great acting, and memorable characters. This film is definitely a masterpiece and it definitely ranks up there with some of the best movies ever made."

At the time it was not an initial hit, but now people look back on Goodfellas and remember it as one of the greats.<br/><br/>The movie overall is amazing.

","I will start from saying, ""what a awesomely different cinematic experience it was"". I know, I watched it quite late. Every cinema lover will regret watching it late in life like me. OK, The film takes you in world of, what they say Goodfellas, where mentality is different, where concept are different, where how they are different, like they living every's one dream, but doing it wrong. Martin Scorsese here does his best, in explaining every bit of perceptive of a gangster world. He does it with honesty. The rise and fall, the glam and the dust, the up and low of the gangster can't be depicted more perfectly like this. For once, you will surely want to live like a gangster aka wise guy.<br/><br/>The Narration is the main USP of the film, the way Ray Liotta narrated his on screen is really commendable. What a guy Ray Liotta is, acted and matched shoulder to shoulder with the biggies of his time. His act was full dual deadly combination, the innocent charming boy with a psychopathy mind & he has done it perfectly. I still wonder where this guy lost after doing such an act. Robert De Niro guts lies in agree to do his part in the film, even after he was big star at this stage. Joe Pesci was hilarious and intense in his own way.<br/><br/>It is not an unknown fact, how great a director Martin Scorsese is, proving himself again and again. The way he narrates a particular story takes to into such a depth. Watching his films is like, watching a entire life. The narrative tech-tics was somewat similar with Wolf of Wall Street (as I have seen WOWS before). But, doing this style of directing way back in 1990 was a mind-blowing thing in its own. I wish I had watched it way earlier."
"Kings_Requiem","8","0","1","15 October 2015"," Funny, how?
","I saw this in a theater last night as part of a special 25th Anniversary screening at the Alamo Drafthouse. It was an interesting experience. This was actually the first time I had seen a movie that I had previously seen on the small screen at the theater. You can't really beat the feeling of seeing something in a theater and that is enhanced even more so when viewing a classic like Goodfellas. The crowd was completely into it from the opening...constantly laughing at certain scenes they knew were coming and even making a few comments here and there about how certain characters were acting. Pretty cool.<br/><br/>A lot of the performances stood out more to me as well this time. Of course the obvious ones are still great (Liotta, Pesci, De Niro & Bracco) but a couple that stood out to me even more on this viewing were Paul Sorvino as Paulie and Christopher Serrone as young Henry. It's actually kind of a shame that Serrone didn't go on to have a good career in Hollywood after this film because he proved he had the chops to be in the ring with the big dogs at only 13 years old. And Sorvino's 2nd to last scene with Liotta in the restaurant where Liotta is apologizing to Paulie should have been enough to get Sorvino an Oscar nomination. The full range of emotions he conveys in that scene with just his eyes is unbelievable.<br/><br/>There were actually a few scenes throughout that I don't remember ever seeing before...which is kinda weird since I've seen the movie at least 10 times now. So that was cool cause it was like I was experiencing those scenes for the first time. Anyway, the movie holds up great and continues to be one of, if not, THE crowning achievement in the gangster genre."

","To say that Joe Pesci is the best part of this film would be to discredit the rest of the cast, but at the same time, you have to mention him in some way. His portrayal of Tommy is haunting. Here is a man that is so insecure and wants to be the top dog, the made man so bad that he can't decipher between what is a joke and what is disrespect towards him. Of course the scene in question is when he shoots a common boy for telling Paulie to screw himself after Paulie shot him in the leg. You would think the guy has a right to let off a little steam and vent, but Paulie is always looking for the diss. He is always looking to find some hidden gesture from someone that is putting him down. Even at the beginning when he is getting on Henri in the now famous "" You're a funny guy "" scene. He is kidding with Henri but deep down inside he is angry with him, you can see it and feel it. Joe Pesci gave the performance of his career and he richly deserved to win best supporting actor that year.<br/><br/>The story and script by Pileggi is sheer inside brilliance. You can feel the inside observations that no one can have except for a guy that spent his whole life on the inside. They ring so true and they get into your blood. From scenes like the fat guy running around delivering messages to the other mob guys because he doesn't like to use the phone to the scene when Henri, Paulie and Tommy have Billy Bats in the trunk but they stop off at Tommy's moms house for a late night dinner of pasta and such. They also have to borrow a sharp knife to finish off the guy in the trunk, but to his mom they have to cut off the hoof of a dear that hit the car. And the scene where Tommy does kill the young kid for joking with him and then Paulie gets mad at him, not for killing the guy but because he doesn't want to dig a hole tonight. There are so many tiny observations in Goodfellas that give it the authenticity it has. And it is a film that stays with you for years to come. I think this is Scorcese's best film and although I understand and accept why the academy awarded Dances With Wolves the accolades it did, if this film would have swept the Oscars that year, no one would have been surprised. It is a landmark film and I think it is one of the best films ever made. And again, taking no credit away from Coppolla's Godfather epics, but this gets inside the mafia on a deeper level. It goes one step beyond what Coppolla gave us, and for that Goodfellas should be remembered as the best film about gangsters ever made."

Although they were gangsters, they were also fathers, brothers and husbands. All of which are dead now. This movie always takes me back. One of my favorite scenes is when Joe Pesci keeps picking on the kid working in the bar until he finally talks back. At first, Robert De Niro congratulates him for the size of his balls which offends Joe. When Joe reacts he shoots to wound him but then is able to laugh it off. In a later scene you see that the kid is still working there."
"bethbrusk-40261","10","0","1","14 June 2015"," Goodfellas depicts the rise and downfall of Henry Hill's mob career, and the demise of his way of life.
","The movie, Goodfellas, is the true story of Henry Hill, a former American mobster. Henry (Ray Liotta) was born into a working class family in Brooklyn, New York. Henry knew from an early age that he wanted more out of life than simply struggling to make ends meet. When, as a teenager, he had the opportunity to run errands for the Lucchese crime family as a means of earning money, he immediately got a taste of the life he so desperately wanted to lead. Henry dropped out of school to begin working for the Lucchese crime family full-time. After his first arrest, Henry learned the most important rule of living life as a mobster: ""Never rat out your friends, and always keep your mouth shut."" Henry quickly made his way through the ranks of the Lucchese crime family, and became very successful in his new career. Henry eventually spends time in prison, and ends up getting involved in a side business of selling drugs, which went against the wishes of the Lucchese crime boss, Paulie (Paul Sorvino). In the end, Henry is forced to turn against his crime family, and leave the mob life that he always wanted to lead in order to save his own life. Goodfellas depicts the rise and downfall of Henry's mob career, and the demise of his way of life.<br/><br/>The theme of Goodfellas is a focus on the character development of Henry Hill, and his desire to live life as a rich and successful gangster. The storyline is presented as a linear flashback of Henry's life, narrated by Henry himself. Henry believed that ""being a gangster was better than being the President of the United States."" It was the only thing that he ever wanted to do. Henry believed that being a gangster would allow him to achieve the highest level of success that he valued most: respect. Henry wanted desperately to be ""a somebody in a neighborhood full of nobodies."" The desire to have the respect of those around him was Henry's motivation to become a gangster.<br/><br/>Henry admired the mob boss, Paulie, for the respect that he garnered – the respect that Henry so desperately wanted to attain. Henry began working at the cabstand and the Pizzeria that Paulie owned, and worked through the ranks of the Mob's organization, from parking cars, to making deliveries, to carrying out important tasks. Henry liked the respect he received from others in the neighborhood due to his association with top gangsters. He stated, ""People looked at me differently, and they knew I was with somebody. I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on Sunday morningthe owner knew who I was, and no matter how many people were in line, I was taken care of first."" Henry's motivation was the respect that he earned in being a gangster.<br/><br/>Henry's compulsive desire for money, social status, and success led him to start a side business of drug dealing, which was something that Paulie strictly forbade, and went against his ""family."" Eventually, Henry gets busted for dealing drugs, and the police have enough evidence of his involvement with drug dealing that he is looking at a life sentence in prison with no parole. Paulie becomes angry because Henry had lied to him and disobeyed his command to stop the drug business. Paulie tells Henry that he has to turn his back on him, meaning that his relationship with the Lucchese crime family is over. Knowing that he, Karen, and their children are marked targets, Henry saw no other choice but to break his trust with the Lucchese crime family and enter the witness protection program so he could divulge information about his dealings with the mob. If he didn't, Henry knew it would just be a matter of time before he and his family were killed. In the end, Henry lost his trust with the people he had worked with for a lifetime, and was forced to turn his back on them, and more importantly, the life he loved the most. He was forced to break the most important rule in the life of a mobster – never rat out your friends, and always keep your mouth shut.<br/><br/>The use of cinematic techniques help to define Henry's character throughout the movie, and support the theme of the rise and fall of Henry's mob career. Director, Martin Scorsese, used unique camera angles to show the development of Henry's character, and the rise of Henry's mobster status. In the first scene that reveals an adult Henry, the camera angle is shooting Henry from the bottom, looking upward, giving Henry the appearance that he is larger than life, and has been raised to mobster status. Another cinematic technique used to further develop Henry's character is through the viewer gaining insight into Henry's internal actions. The entire film is told through Henry's perspective, and the viewer has insight into Henry's deepest thoughts about his own actions and the actions of those around him.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is a study in how Henry's greed and desire for status and respect ultimately leads to his downfall. For Henry, even harder than breaking trust and turning against his crime family, was the loss of the way of life he had become so accustomed to, as Henry states in the final scene:<br/><br/>The hardest thing for me was to have to leave the life. I still love the lifeAnd now, it's all over.There's no action – I have to wait around like everyone else I'm an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.<br/><br/>Henry lost everything he had ever wanted out of life. As the movie fades, you see the end result of Henry's deal with the witness protection program – living in suburbia, he is now forced to live the boring life of the people he used to mock – the life of a schnook."

","By the time 1990 came around, Martin Scorsese had already made several masterpieces in film, which continue to be praised and talked about to this day. With the likes of 'Raging Bull', 'Taxi Driver', and 'The Last Waltz', we all knew that Scorsese was one of the finest filmmakers and storytellers around. Even with just those three previous films mentioned, you'd know you were in for a treat when Scorsese wanted to show you something. Then 1990 came around and Scorsese once again changed the film community with a movie called 'Goodfellas', which was his big foray into the whole mafia genre.<br/><br/>Like myself, I think that most everyone around would say that 'Goodfellas' is one of the best mafia movie that has ever been put on film. Besides 'The Godfather I and II', I'm willing to bet that 'Goodfellas' can stand side by side with those two films, because it is just that good. However, Scorsese told this mafia drama in such a different way, that it got most filmmakers to start telling their stories on film the same way that Scorsese did with 'Goodfellas'. It's one of those movies that while it may be over 3 hours long, it is completely re-watchable at any time or day, because the characters, dialogue, and story are so compelling and told in such a fantastic and realistic fashion, that you can't help but watch the whole thing all over again, and become entranced by what's transpiring on screen.<br/><br/>In 1986, a writer by the name of Nicholas Pileggi wrote a non-fiction book about a real life mafia guy named Henry Hill. This book called 'Wiseguy' detailed the life of Henry Hill from his childhood through his adulthood, as he joined the Lucchese crime family at an early age. The book talked about all the acts of violence and criminal activity that went on, including the largest heist in American history at the time, which was the Lufthansa heist. Luckily, Scorsese got a hold of the book and decided to make a film with a young Ray Liotta playing Henry Hill, who narrated what went on throughout the film.<br/><br/>Scorsese also got two 'Raging Bull' actors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci to star in this film, which earned Pesci a numerous amount of awards. Scorsese did something that original with this mafia genre, which was tell this story from a sentimental side from the eyes of these bad guys. Yes, we know that these iconic character are violent criminals who murder, steal, and exploit, but we also got to see the family and vulnerable side to them as well, which is one of the reasons 'Goodfellas' is such an achievement in filmmaking. We virtually get to meet almost everyone in the Lucchese crime family and not only see them commit these heinous acts of crime, but we get to see them being friends with one another, taking care of their families, and sticking up for each other.<br/><br/>As many as there are kills and blood in 'Goodfellas', there is as much laughs and jokes, which makes this realistic. The real life Henry Hill really laid everything out on the table for Scorsese and Pileggi to get acquire the total realness of the story and picture. Each character is based on someone in real life, which is kind of difficult to imagine. Even some of the more iconic dialogue scenes were taken from real instances, such as the ""Am I funny to you"" scene with Liotta and Pesci. It's a funny scene, but damn is it scary for a moment when you have no idea what Pesci's character Tommy is capable of. That's why this film is so amazing. You get sucked in to feeling for these guys and want to be their friends, because they are all charming and fun, but we are quickly given a wake up call to see just how rotten these ""Goodfellas"" are.<br/><br/>Still, after 25 years, 'Goodfellas' continues to be one of the best films ever made and paved the way for Scorsese into the mafia genre, as well as this brilliant style of filmmaking. We saw it in 'Casino', 'The Departed', and the recent 'Wolf of Wall Street' film, and never disappoints. But 'Goodfellas' is where it all started and continues to be the foundation for most modern mafia films. I'll never get tired of seeing this movie."
"cristiang-sensey","10","0","1","8 April 2015"," Remarkable story..
","I must start by saying that ""Goodfellas"" is one of the greatest movies ever made, being inspired from real events.<br/><br/>The movie represents a display of Martin Scorsese's ingenuity in directing and writing at its highest degree. Scorsese delicately mixes deception, greed, love and the need for power into one fantastic story, at the center of which stands the life as a mobster and all its inherent tribulations.<br/><br/>The cast is as good as they come, but the most impressive is Joe Pesci , whose transcendent and quite short performance is the heart of the movie, beating increasingly until his very end. His character's loyalty, dark humor, impulsiveness, irascibility and complete disregard of society's laws compose, more or less, the typical "" wise guy"" of that time. The most memorable scene which masterfully displays some of these traits is the one in the bar, on poker's night, when he feels humiliated by his friends' intense laughter after being cursed by the waiter, Spider, and his instinctive reaction is to kill him, thinking that this will remove the temporary stain on his cultivated reputation.<br/><br/>The masterpiece illustrates in a most special way the methods gangsters unscrupulously use to make a living (stealing, killing, etc.), their hypocrisy towards each other, promoting love and tolerance when some of them would betray the others in a blink, and their inexorable addiction to, in a wider sense, more.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" remains one of the most remarkable movies I have ever seen."
"peter_kooistra_91","9","0","1","24 February 2015"," One of the best movies ever
","In terms of directing, Scorsese is in top form, with an energetic camera that darts, strolls and struts around rooms. In editing, he clips dialogue tightly and packs the soundtrack with pop music that unifies the movie's time span of nearly 30 years.<br/><br/>Beyond that, what is so excellent about Scorsese is that his visual strategy underscores his moral sensibility. When Henry's wife Karen agrees to hide his gun, Scorsese photographs it from above as if it were a sacrament (as he did with the guns in ''Taxi Driver'') and then cuts to a religious marriage ritual that emphasizes the importance of what Karen has done.<br/><br/>All of the performances are first-rate; Pesci stands out, though, with his seemingly unscripted manner. ''GoodFellas'' is easily one of the year's best films."

","In my opinion ""GoodFellas"" is not a masterpiece. It is a good movie, I don't deny this but he isn't special. I have everything in this movie seen before and better. Hennry Hill isn't an interesting character, he is every mafiosi in movie history but the fact that he didn't notice who crashed he at the end of the movie and believes that he lost his dignity ,which he lost right before, is interesting enough. When I watched this movie I had the feeling that something is missing, the condiment. It's difficult to describe but there are much more better Gangster movies, with better characters who you care about, with more tension, not just Biopic about a gangster who a member of the Cosa Nostra for 30th years. GoodFellas is just okay."

","I thought this was an amazing movie and portrayal of the events that happened in the life of Henry Hill. The gangsters were truly brought to life and showed the brutality of the way things were back then. Joe Pesci really knew how to put the fear of God into others in his role as Tommy, if the real-life Tommy was anything like that I don't think I would want to meet him. I will admit that the part where I felt a little sympathy for Tommy was during the portion where one of the older gang members got out of jail and was at the bar party and ridiculed Tommy in front of everybody. Although, I did feel that Tommy went too far in his actions of murdering the man. Some of my favorite movies have always been gangster movies based on those time periods."

"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","2","27 June 2014"," 'Goodfellas' is a perfect film that is an absolute classic from legendary film artist Martin Scorsese.
","Calling a film ""perfect"" is a strong statement. The reasons why 'Goodfellas' is indeed a perfect film are infinitive. 'Goodfellas' is a crime classic about the New York mob in the 1950's-80's. The story is focused on mobster Henry Hill, who wanted to be a gangster since a young age. He adored their lifestyle of power, fame, and wealth, and was very impressionable, which lead him to partially succeed in the crime world. Henry Hill is portrayed wonderfully by Ray Liotta. Henry goes on to meet Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro's best performance)and Tommy De Vito (the best mob performance of all time by Joe Pesci.) The three men or ""Goodfellas"" lived a life of crime by stealing, killing, and loosing throughout their lives. The men encounter various criminals who are also full of violence and greed, which causes tension and acquaintances throughout this legendary story. Martin Scorsese's is perhaps the greatest filmmaker of all time, and 'Goodfellas is by far his greatest film. Every camera shot and film element are so intriguing and shot elaborately to portray the mafia lifestyle like no other artist has, that's top offed with an awesome soundtrack with some of the greatest mob hits. Scorsese also wrote this spectacular story that contains rich and realistic dialog, mostly coming from actor Joe Pesci. Pesci delivers a performance of a chilling, funny, and brutal mobster named Tommy De Vito, who's dialog is the stuff of cinematic history. De Niro portrays a gangster beautifully, not only looking and sounding the part, but making history come to life in every scene. 'Goodfellas' takes us in a world manipulated by greed and violence, and is the ultimate story of getting into trouble due to first impressions and fantasy, as well as loosing everything for power. Every cinematic element is a great representation of 1990's film making due to its inspiring shots and editing that have inspired many filmmakers to use as guidance in making their films. Crime films are by far some of the greatest ever produced, but 'Goodfellas' stands strong upon them, and is by far the greatest mob film ever made, and perhaps the greatest film ever made."

","For some reason I had missed seeing this movie for all these years, but recently found it on BluRay at my local public library. The picture and sound are first-rate and has several very interesting extras. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most interesting one is Henry Hill himself talking about his former life as a gangster and stating that this movie is at least 95%, no 99%, realistic and true. Crime reporter Nicholas Pileggi helped Hill write the book Wiseguy, published in 1986. This movie is based on that book. He died the day after he turned 69, in 2012.<br/><br/>Many consider this Martin Scorsese's masterpiece. It isn't my favorite genre, it contains lots of violence and gore, plus lots of graphic cursing. But for its type, yes it is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Among the gangsters we have Robert De Niro as James Conway, Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill who also narrates, so we know he will survive. Joe Pesci is devastatingly good as the despicable Tommy DeVito who will shoot anyone outside the ""family"" if he gets mad at them. Paul Sorvino is Paul Cicero.<br/><br/>So what we have is a portrait over a couple of decades of these men who look at their life of crime as their business. They see an opportunity, they arrange a heist, that is their life. But it is a dangerous life with a short cycle, they will each soon be in prison or be killed.<br/><br/>In the end when Hill sensed that he was being set up for an execution, he and his wife tried to run only to be caught by the Feds. He ended up being the star witness to put the others away, in exchange for his freedom.<br/><br/>As an aside of sorts, some of the scenes are set at the Copacabana club, and in one we get to see Jerry Vale singing, while in another Bobby Vinton's son is shown lip-syncing an original Bobby Vinton song. Nice touches!"

","Let me just say that while I don't think this is a perfect film, it's a total classic. Do I think that sometimes it's a bit overrated because a lot of film critics or film teachers claim it's perfect? Yeah, but do I enjoy it? Yeah I do. I also think it deserves a lot of credit, because it does a whole lot of great things. <br/><br/>This film is a big sprawling story, following a gangster over the many years of his life. You really feel like you've witnessed his life once you reach the end of the film. The film is very fast paced and can quickly give you lots of information in a short amount of time, and I think it does it well. However I feel that Scorsese's later films such as Casino or The Wolf Of Wallstreet have this same style, but do it better. But Goodfellas should still be respected.<br/><br/>There are tons of great performances here. Everyone does a great job and just feels natural. It has an almost documentary feeling because everyone just seems like they aren't acting, but just living their lives. It really helps strengthen the film.<br/><br/>To me, it's not a perfect film, but it's a movie that should be seen, especially if you're a fan of films or a film maker. It's a classic and deserves to be respected."

","Goodfellas is often featured in the 'Top 10' greatest films ever. And, it certainly doesn't disappoint. I suppose the only person who wouldn't enjoy it is someone who really hates gangster films (or perhaps is very offended by strong language and/or violence).<br/><br/>However, for all those who can appreciate films which show the darker side of humanity - in this case one that tells the story of (real life) gangster Henry Hill and how he climbs the ranks of the local mob. Yes, there's plenty of foul language along the way, not to mention a fair few violent 'hits' on anyone who gets in his way. So, if you're into that, then this is for you.<br/><br/>Not only is the story gripping, but the performances and direction are all up to scratch. You know it's a high quality cast when someone - in this case Joe Pesci - actually manages to upstage Robert DeNiro (the 'waiter' and the 'clown' scenes to start with). But, Pesci aside, all the cast play their parts brilliantly and you can't really fault any of them.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Goodfellas, you really need to.

Most films, even great ones, evaporate like mist once you've returned to the real world; they leave memories behind, but their reality fades fairly quickly. Not this film, which shows America's finest filmmaker at the peak of his form. No finer film has ever been made about organized crime - not even ""The Godfather,"" although the two works are not really comparable Like ""The Godfather,"" Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"" is a long movie, with the space and leisure to expand and explore its themes. It isn't about any particular plot; it's about what it felt like to be in the Mafia - the good times and the bad times. At first, they were mostly good times, and there is an astonishing camera movement in which the point of view follows Henry and Karen on one of their first dates, to the Copacabana nightclub. There are people waiting in line at the door, but Henry takes her in through the service entrance, past the security guards and the off-duty waiters, down a corridor, through the kitchen, through the service area and out into the front of the club, where a table is literally lifted into the air and placed in front of all the others so that the young couple can be in the first row for the floor show<br/><br/>Magnificent!!!"

","Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is an epic historical mob film which is similar to Bugsy, and American Gangster. The movie tells the story of how Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta) and his mob friends Jim Conway (played by Robert De Niro), Tommy De Vito (played by Joe Pesci), and Paul Cicero (played by Paul Sorvino), ended up working their way up through the mob hierarchy. What Martin Scorsese tries to show not only how the mob underworld, but he also tries to show us how brutal the mob can really be against their own crime family members. Also without question Martin Scorsese is one of the world's greatest film directors, thanks to great movies like Gangs of New York, The Aviator, and his Oscar wining turn for The Departed. Both Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta give the best performances of their careers in Scorsese's well done mob picture. And another thing Scorsese tries to show us in this movie is the conflicts between Henry and his wife Karen (played perfectly by Lorraine Bracco). This was a mob movie achievement and of what I thought was an absolutely great movie."

","Finally watched Martin Scorsese's classic crime drama thriller 1990's ""Goodfellas"" and I wasn't surprised I knew what to expect as Martin's films involve most of the time New York, crime, and the real tales of the mob underworld. The film is powerful with it's crime, drama and human emotion as blood and greed is spilled while racking up power and excess only as with most morality stories all of it comes crashing down in the end. The chemistry is fantastic with the all star cast of Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco and one of my favorites Joe Pesci. It tells the real life story of small time crook and criminal Henry Hill(Ray Liotta)who climbs up the ranks of the mob underworld after taking part in a big time robbery. And his partner in crime is the big boss James Conway(DeNiro)and thru it all it's a struggle with his trophy wife Karen(Lorraine Bracco)as despite the times of big money and diamonds Henry has a mistress on the side to drive Karen crazy! In a short and sweet note Joe Pesci hams it up as mobster sidekick Tommy Devito.

Die hard fan of De Niro and Scorsese combination may get disappointed but one has to understand that no one color is better than any other. And it's just the way writer and director has chosen Ray color more over De Niro color. Despite few hard to watch graphic scenes, this one has strange sense of humor that gives different perspective of Gangsters. They are humane in every way, except the way they choose to make money and their self respect for being gangsters. On one edge, we watched Godfather-where you will laugh only if you fooled yourself for not getting story or asking why would any Don go to shop fruits, Goodfellas has funny moment one after another, between friends, enemies, police/gangster, and my favorite one is one in Joe's dining table with his mother. Joe steals the show where ever he is but as we watch him from Ray's perspective, we laugh even louder as Ray finds Joe's jokes much more funny than they actually are. I am dying to see Scorsese coming back to this phase where we get to watch, have fun and ultimately take home a huge lesson. I mean, there are movies where we see character arcs, but this one is brilliant in so many ways. It is not boring at all, and the shift in the arc is almost perpendicular as we know Ray from very beginning that all he wanted to be is Gangster and by the end of film, we see him as someone else."

","""It was a glorious time."" Glorious doesn't begin to describe this 1990 gangster flick by Martin Scorsese, starring Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and the inevitable Robert De Niro. It quickly became a cult classic and therefore it was no coincidence that legendary film critic Roger Ebert called it the greatest mob film of all time. <br/><br/>Goodfellas deals with the rise and downfall of half-Irish, half- Italian mobster Henry Hill. Born in an Italian-American neighborhood in Brooklyn, Henry Hill is soon intrigued by the lifestyle of the local mafia family. Henry becomes a part of the crime organization, which includes Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Henry enjoys the luxuries of being with the mafia for several years and finds a wife in Karen (Lorraine Bracco). He earns his living by robbing, racketeering and other criminal activities. However, eventually, the gangster life becomes too much for him and in order to avoid being imprisoned, he goes into the Witness Protection Program. He incriminates all of his former friends and is forced to give up the exciting gangster lifestyle to live the rest of his life ""like a schnook"". <br/><br/>There are several reasons why Goodfellas can be considered a great film and a must-see . Firstly, Scorsese's movies are known for their adept use of music, and Goodfellas isn't any different. Nobody wanted to be in Morrie's (Chuck Low) shoes after Robert De Niro stared at him for 60 seconds, Cream's Sunshine of Your Love rendering the situation exceedingly frightening. Every scene is accompanied by music appropriate to the scene, as well as captivating the setting in which Goodfellas is set.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting performances in Goodfellas are memorable to say the least. De Niro is practically born to play a mafioso, but the most remarkable performance is perhaps that of Joe Pesci, in his portrayal of Tommy DeVito, an Italian-American gangster with a short fuse. Pesci sucks all the attention towards him in every scene, which results in a great mixture of hilarious and shocking moments. Strangely, even though he has a (psychopathic) tendency towards violence, you empathize with Tommy, which is all Pesci's credit for making him a 'family man'. The Academy thankfully rewarded him for his troubles with an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. <br/><br/>Goodfellas deals with important themes such as love, marriage, family and crime. Therefore, what makes this gangster film so enduring and interesting is the sympathetic and likable characters which the actors bring to the screen. Often, gangster movies are associated with stereotypical characters, ""tough guys"" who love to 'lean on a guy' or push the proverbial 'button'. However, Marty shows us the human side of these gangsters. Therefore, this duality in the characters intensifies the shock you endure when for example Tommy suddenly violently erupts.<br/><br/>For all the above reasons, I consider Goodfellas a must-see and modern classic like no other. Goodfellas is full of quotable and funny dialogues (funny how?) and excellent acting, making it one of the greatest movies of all time."

That he narrates his own story--and is later joined by his wife, narrating hers--is crucial to the movie's success. This is not an outsider's view, but a point-of-view movie based on nostalgia for the lifestyle. ""<br/><br/>At the end of the film, Henry (Ray Liotta) still misses the old days. His money is gone, most of his friends are dead, and his best friend was preparing to kill him, but after he finds safety in the federal witness protection program, he still complains. ""We were treated like movie stars with muscle,"" he remembers. ""Today, everything is different. There's no action. I have to wait around like everyone else.""<br/><br/>Many of Scorsese's best films have been poems about guilt.<br/><br/>""GoodFellas"" is about guilt more than anything else. But it is not a straightforward morality play, in which good is established and guilt is the appropriate reaction toward evil. No, the hero of this film feels guilty for not upholding the Mafia code - guilty of the sin of betrayal. And his punishment is banishment, into the witness protection program, where nobody has a name and the headwaiter certainly doesn't know it."

","If The Godfather (1972) is grand opera, Goodfellas is Grand Guignol. The violence is sudden and brutal, with no effort at cosmetics. This is a blue-collar crime ring Hill (Liotta) belongs to, with connections to the Mafia. They've got just enough juice to act with impunity. Shoot a kid waiter— don't worry about the law; after all, that's what the payoffs are for. Want to impress your girl with a table up front at the Copa— don't worry they'll make one. These are criminal entrepreneurs, looking to make a buck anywhere, except dealing dope (too risky, I guess), that is, until Hill fatefully succumbs. It's an exciting life, as long as you stay on the right side of the unwritten rules. So, even the underworld operates by a standard of justice, namely their own. As to the rest of the world—that's made up of 9 to 5 schnooks.<br/><br/>Liotta turns in a fine controlled performance in the central role of Henry Hill. Ditto, DeNiro as the dangerous Jimmy. But, Pesci is all out psychotic as Tommy. It's hard to see how the gang could put up with a nutty loose cannon like him even if he does furnish the movie with its edgy appeal. Scorcese directs with down-home gusto, focusing almost as much on family life as the criminal. Still, the 160-minute result could easily have been trimmed back. That would have tightened the impact. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, the movie is a fascinating look at urban crime, proletarian style."

","During one of the many thrilling montage sequences littered throughout one of Martin Scorsese's most revered films, gangster Henry Hill arrives home at Christmas time with a giant white and tacky Christmas tree and announces ""I got the most expensive tree they had!"". This sums up the colourful characters that inhabit Goodfellas, cheap, trashy thugs who hold more value to material possessions with hefty price-tags than human life. It has been criticised for glamorising these criminal types, all sharp, shiny suits, slick hair and big cars, and it's easy to get lost amongst the glitz and lifestyle. But although Scorsese alludes to the appeal of this live-fast way of life, he doesn't have much sympathy for its characters, and rightly so. Henry Hill may be the protagonist, our window into this world of high-rolling mafioso, but when he's stripped of his 'friends' and cash, he's not much more than a coke-addled rat.<br/><br/>Ever since he was a little kid, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) always wanted to be a gangster. In his blue-collar, Irish Brooklyn neighbourhood, he begins by parking cadillacs for local gangsters, and eventually starts to work for Jimmy 'The Gent' Conway (Robert De Niro). As the years go by, Henry, Jimmy and Italian-American loose-canon Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) form a small crew hijacking trucks and carrying out heists. Henry marries a wild and beautiful Jewish girl named Karen (Lorraine Bracco), and things seem peachy under the watch of boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino). But when Henry starts selling cocaine under the disapproving Paulie's nose, his world begins to crumble and he can no longer trust his friend, and the ugly side of the gangster business rears its head.<br/><br/>Looking back at his early works such as Mean Streets (1973) and his documentary short Italianamerican (1974), there was always a sense of authenticity in Scorsese's Italian-American-focused work. All the talk now so clearly associated with Italian-Americans was practically invented by the director, and became so influential it now seems cliché and stereotyping. But Scorsese came from these types of neighbourhoods, and this rubs off on Goodfellas. This world seems so unreal - a world where a character can be beating money out of someone one minute, and then being sent champagne by a famous crooner the next - yet it comes alive in Scorsese's hands. The much-celebrated Steadicam sequence has been much imitated, but it still retains its crown. You get washed away amongst it all just like Karen.<br/><br/>The film simply catapults you through it's story, showing snippets of gangster life through some breathtaking montages with voice-over narration. One minute Henry is enjoying new found love, sipping champagne while the glorious soundtrack plays in the background, the next he's on a paranoid and ill-fated drug deal. At the end I felt exhausted, like I'd just lived an entire life within 2 hours, and I've seen this film many times. But still, 24 years after it was made, it still feels fresh, energetic and innovative. Perhaps The Sopranos took its mantle when it took the gangster genre and made it a metaphor for American consumption, but it owes Goodfellas an overwhelming dose of gratitude. It also make it all the more tragic that Joe Pesci has retired from film, as his Oscar-winning performance and the final shot of him shooting at the camera a la The Great Train Robbery (1903) will linger long after the credits have rolled.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","This is the greatest mob movie that I have ever watched, better than The Godfather, Donnie Brasco or The Untouchables, it is perfection and no doubt my favourite movie. On the face of it this movie isn't that impressive, the rise and fall of a couple of mobsters but the way Scorsese brings the characters to life is superb and what makes this film. There is no scene in the film were you think 'was that really necessary,' every scene is amazing and only adds to the suspense. The main actors of Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta put in the performance of there careers in this movie, there is a great juxtaposition between the brash psychotic nature of Joe Pesci's character and Robert DeNiro's character against the softer Henry Hill(Ray Liotta's character). The focus of the film is undoubtedly on Henry Hill not DeNiro or Pesci's characters, you witness his rise through the mob as he gets deeper and deeper into the most dangerous of professions and then his fall from grace, this occurs over the last 50 minutes and is truly captivating. The script in this film is fantastic as well, the way the characters bounce off each other seems so smooth and the fact that a huge number of scenes are improvised only adds the the natural chemistry between characters,the whole ""why am I funny scene"" is improvised. To conclude this film puts no step wrong and in my opinion is the benchmark for all gangster films, the acting and the script is what makes this film so special and it has yet to be matched by anything."

De Niro once again proves why once again he is one of the finest actors of his generation. The chemistry between Pesci, De Niro and Liotta is off the scale. The concept and pacing of the story is wonderful and one of the finest films i can recommend. Violent, yes but its necessary to the story. Lorraine Bracco plays her role brilliantly and brings a certain east coast charm. The feeling of being out of control grows with the viewer as you watch its principal character spiral into welcomed chaos and violence. I find Goodfellas to be one of Scorsese's finest films and any fan of cinema needs to make it a point to witness this film. Appealing in many ways, you'll find yourself helpless to turn away as its quite easy to get attached to these characters even though they are excessively violent and out of control."

","What can I say about this masterpiece. This flick is about the life of gangster Henry Hill during his time as one. Everyone gives great performances but Joe Pesci shines above everyone which he did deserve the Oscar for. This film has many great scenes, the best being the 'Funny How?' bit which is one of the most intense scenes ever put to film. Martin Scorcese proves in this the amount of greatness he can provide. He gets his actors to improvise which makes them immeresed into the roles. So I am pretty much saying this the just the best film ever made. I don't blame you if you want to go and watch this film.

There are so many standout performances that to pick one seems a slight on the others,but Joe Pesci where did that come from? Simply awesome.

"adam-c-zawacki","7","0","1","2 December 2013"," the good life
","This film is very well made and it points out the lifestyle of gangsters. Although the movie is a fantastic film, i have to say that the portrayal of the violence and the glorified life that the gangsters lead is very unrealistic. They all seem to be wading through life and it seems as though the characters have very little remorse or feelings when they kill people. It puts gang violence into a more ""every day"" setting and it makes it out to be something that is okay and somehow justified. In the beginning of the film it is stated that everything that they do is part of protecting ""the family"" and that the mob is a kind of police for ""wise guys"". They make it feel as though everything that they are doing is morally right. I have to say that the movie could have been better if there was less glorification. They could have had more realistic events and more realistic emotions. In the end this is based on true crime and it would have been nice to see a less Hollywood influenced story line and characters."

","Goodfellas is a good movie, however it isn't great. Though It is great compared to other big crime movies save for The Godfather and Casino. Ray Liotta was good, but I feel that the shoes of Henry Hill could be filled by most actors. And with how over the top Joe Pesci was, it's fair to say that he stole the thunder away from most other characters.<br/><br/>But it was a nice change to see a different view on the mob; taken from the perspective of a soldier instead of a made man or a don. Especially when most of it was straight from Henry Hill himself. It gave the movie an eerie truth to it. The truth about crime and how mob families get away from the law. And throughout the movie there was never a time where a character did something untrue to their concept. The actual people that were portrayed were much more terrifying, some even inhumanly mean.<br/><br/>But this movie stands out as a good example of the true crime genre. Especially because it is an accurate portrayal of Henry Hill from the man himself and combines accuracy with substance. Perhaps it seems like the genre has stepped away from the greatness of the pre-2000 era, but thats not for me to say"

(A Bronx Tale is definitely second in ranking though) Anywho, this movie is packed with everything you could ever want from a ideally good movie. There's action, suspense, drama, comedy, romance, etc. The story is very relatable and refreshing. You follow the main character from his rise to his fall and even highlighting on his humble beginnings. You infiltrate the personal lives of each character and you connect so well with each character that it feels as if they are close friends to you. You feel the anxiety, fears, etc of each character and it becomes something more of a journey for you; a winding road if you will. The suspense really gets you and drags you in wholeheartedly."

"mckelv03","9","0","1","21 September 2013"," ""Never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut.""
","The film, Goodfellas, is a modern day gangster film brilliantly directed by Martin Scorsese. The film is sure to be an instant classic and stars Ray Liotta, as Henry Hill, Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, and Joe Pesci as Tommy. The film, a crime drama, is based on a true story and chronicles Henry Hill as he transitions into a gangster family. This film has a character driven theme with a plot based on the business of being a gangster. The characters are presented like family members and the ""family"" business revolves around protecting people who cannot, for various reason, reach out to local law enforcement. The golden rule in this family business is to ""never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut"". <br/><br/>The film unfolds in a series of flashbacks spanning from 1955 to 1970 and opens with Henry Hill, as a young man. He recounts his fascination with the gangster lifestyle and what drew him deeper into ""the family business"". As a young man, the fascination was with the power associated with being affiliated with the gangsters. He was earning very good money and gaining respect along the way. To a young Henry Hill, his new found gangster family were well dressed gentleman who always had money and were respected in their community for ""sharing"" their wealth and protecting the innocent. <br/><br/>The film goes on to introduce the other members of the ""family"". Pauly, played by Paul Sorvino, is the head of the ""family"" and keeps everyone in line and earning to support the entire business. Henry's mentor in the business is Jimmy, and Jimmy liked to steal. Jimmy did his business as a gentleman, paying for his tip-offs and treating his ""victims"" with respect. He would rob the trucks and sell off the goods, insuring that everyone got a piece and making everyone happy with ""the deal"". Tommy is Henry's cohort in crime as they develop their side of the business together. Tommy introduces Henry to his wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco, and they live like brothers and raise their families in the suburbs. Karen, as Henry's wife, is more than happy to turn her head to the family business as long as it suits her needs.<br/><br/>The editing, and specifically the transitions, are essential to this movie as the movie spans a thirty year time period. The editing throughout this movie is key for these transitions as there is much back and forth between the current time frame of the film, as well as the history leading up to those points. This back and forth editing allows for the character of Henry Hill to be fully developed and provides the viewer the history behind the character and the choices that he ultimately makes. <br/><br/>As a result of the frequent flashback series, there is also significant voice-over narration throughout the movie. During the first half of the movie, the background of the Henry Hill character is told via several flashback scenarios. The film opens with a flashback sequence that takes the view back to Henry's childhood. The adult voice of Henry is noted as the younger version of Henry's childhood plays out. This sequencing continues to explain how Henry met his wife, got married, had children, and delved further into the family business<br/><br/>The story is brilliantly told makes it is easy to understand how a young and impressionable Henry gets pulled into the business. As the story unfolds, the viewer begins to feel the increasing pressure that Henry is under to continue to earn for this family partners. As the film ends, it is evident that Henry has broken the golden rule of the family business and has turned into his own worse nightmare. As with all families, things may look pretty on the outside, but rarely do you find one without a set of problems."

","Review #3 of ""My Top Ten Favorite Movies"" Reviews <br/><br/>Goodfellas is a 'true' picture; unlike some mob movies, it doesn't glorify organized crime, per se, it captures it perfectly on-screen.<br/><br/>The key in the success of Goodfelas is the dialogue. The script is just absolutely amazing. As profane and raw as it is, it really gives you a glimpse of how gangsters actually work and what they actually do. There's no denying the realistic nature of the film and how Scorcese's genius puts this film on the same level as ""The Godfather"", if not better.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are captivating. De Niro's calm, collected character is offset by Pesci's loose cannon, loud-mouthed performance. Pesci definitely deserved the Oscar he won for this role, as he plays a character that is sick, as shown by his actions, yet likable all the same. That just shows what a great actor Pesci is.<br/><br/>Liotta gets Henry Hill down perfectly. His performance is one of the best in his whole acting career. He is innocent, yet violent; quiet, yet he has a temper at times; calm, yet crazy; his personality contradicts itself throughout the movie, yet this isn't a bad thing. In fact, it makes his character *that* much more interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, this Oscar Winning, highly acclaimed picture deserves all the hype it gets: it's smart, realistic, and raw. These elements combine to form one of the best Gangster movies ever made. And yes, I think it is even better than ""The Godfather"".<br/><br/>HandHStudios Rating: 10/10"
"mrrockey","9","0","1","31 August 2013"," Possibly the Greatest Mob Portrayal in the History of Cinema
","Goodfellas is one of the most iconic films of all-time. It's often listed as one of the greatest movies of all-time and the famous ""funny guy"" scene has been parodied countless times. It struck a huge impact on the genre and influenced countless gangster films that came after it. But why is that? Let's find out! <br/><br/>Firstly, the story and how it's told. While the story in Goodfellas about the rise and fall of a gangster is nothing new, it's the way that Scorsese tells the story that makes it so compelling. The movie opens immediately with Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy driving late at night in the highway and then stopping their car to check their trunk and then... it turns out that there's a guy who's all bloodied up there and then Tommy stabs the guy a few times and Jimmy finishes him off by shooting him at point blank and then boom! The movie starts and it never slows down. What's so effective about this opening is that it immediately grabs your attention. We don't start out with any boring exposition dialogue, we get thrown right in the middle of the murder and it makes the audience want to find out why they killed this guy. It's a brilliant opening scene and it's one of the greatest in all of cinema in my opinion.<br/><br/>The rest of the film goes through the life of Henry Hill from his teenage years working at a mafia-owned cabstand to dealing drugs behind their back at a brisk, fast pace. This movie has a lot of plot and it could've been really long and boring if it was made by a weaker director but Scorsese keeps the plot going at a fast pace and uses a lot of interesting shooting and editing choices to keep the film interesting. <br/><br/>The first half of the film shows the positive side of being a mobster as we get to see Henry take Karen to the Copacabana, steal trucks, rob an airport, and beat the snot out of a man for touching his girl. A lot of people say that this film glamorizes the lifestyle of a gangster from watching this half but I think it's necessary because it makes it believable why Henry would want to join the mob in the first place and it makes the audience enjoy the lifestyle while watching it. The thing that makes this part of the film so enjoyable is how fast-paced it is. We go through all this plot and information in a fast-paced manner so we never get bored in such a long film. Also, the shooting and editing in this film is excellent. Scorsese shot and edited this film with a sense of intensity and it works because it keeps the audience interested rather than if they just used flat, static shots the entire time like the Star Wars prequel.<br/><br/>The second half is when the sh!t starts hitting the fan. This is the part in the film where things start going really bad for the characters. Tommy gets whacked for killing Billy Batts, Henry gets arrested for dealing drugs, and Jimmy becomes a paranoid wreck over an airport robbery and starts killing members of his crew out of fear of them leading him to his demise. What's so great about this part of the film is that you really feel the fear and anxiety the characters are feeling. When Henry gets released from prison and gets really paranoid about getting whacked for dealing drugs, you feel the same way because you care about his character. It's quite an accomplishment to make you feel for a mobster/drug dealer.<br/><br/>I haven't talked about the performances yet so I might as well here. Ray Liotta is really underrated in this film. He plays Henry as a douchebag and not a nice guy but we do see his humanity when he sees Tommy murdering people. He makes us both pity him when he's caught dealing drugs and find him despicable when he's cheating on Karen and it's sad that when people talk about this movie, they never bring up his performance because he's actually really great in this film. Robert De Niro is the middle ground character of the trio. He's not as violent as Tommy but he doesn't have as much of a conscience as Henry and he plays it well, showing both the ruthless gangster side as well as the respectable side. The actor who gets the most attention for this film is Joe Pesci. He plays Tommy as an explosive, violent psychopath who would kill you just for looking at him the wrong way and yet, he's still really funny because of the way he talks. He's a joy to watch in this film!<br/><br/>Lastly, I want to bring up Scorsese's choice of music in this film. The music he chooses in this movie consists mainly of 70's rock & roll and pop music and they fit with every scene in this movie. When Henry's dating Karen, Bobby Vinton's Roses are Red and it helps in creating a romantic scene. When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10/10."

","Sure this is a gangster movie and in the genre of gangster movies this stands as one of the greatest of all time. But I think this movie holds that title even out of its genre. I think this is one of the greatest movies of all time. From realistic characters and some of the finest acting in movies, to an epic story full of humor/suspense/drama/tragedy, the colorful dialog that feels so organic you wouldn't be able to tell the actors are reciting lines from a script and the most amazing part of it all is the fact that this all actually happened. I can't help but feel more drawn into movies that are based off real events. Sure its a movie but its telling a real story that I haven't heard before, I don't know who lives and dies in this story and because these characters represent real people I can't help but think when someone dies in the movie its possible that person they are playing was actually killed in real life. And that makes me care about the characters in the movie so much more.<br/><br/>This is an example of a gangster movie that doesn't need action to be a good a movie. There aren't crazy shoot outs and explosions going off every 5 minutes, its the mob. The real mob... the ""cut your throat in your sleep quietly"" mob. Every aspect of the movie was done so well. The actors play their roles perfectly, the director shot this movie to make every scene an amazingly epic visual spectacle for the audience, the writer drenched every part of this story with realistic human emotion and Henry Hill got to tell his story through an amazing piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Realism is by far this movies best aspect. The story is being told by Henry Hill and the movie portrayed the actual events from the actual point of view it was lived from. In this movie you won't know anything Henry Hill doesn't know. For example towards the end (not a spoiler don't worry) Henry Hill's wife was told to go into a shop and pick up a dress, she felt as if she was going to walk into a trap and get whacked. So she left in hurry, we aren't told whether she was actually going to get whacked... we aren't shown a piece of evidence other than there are people in that store and they stopped talking the second she walked up. We don't know if it was actually going to happen, because the real Henry Hill didn't know if it was actually going to happen. That is realism, that is a movie that stays true to the person's point of view.<br/><br/>There are tons of those tiny little details like that in the movie. And while they maybe minor details to the story, they actually show the true cinematic genius that went into this absolutely amazing movie."

","Most mafia movies don't really capture what the real life mafia is truly about.... simply a group of sociopaths who are obsessed with money, and who have found a way to make money by being sociopaths.<br/><br/>This movie is the real thing.<br/><br/>I love the Godfather trilogy, but its explanation of how you get to be the Don of a mafia family -- by going up against the local crime boss -- is ludicrous. Goodfellas shows you the way it really works: the way you become a mafioso is by sucking up to crime bosses, to the point that you will do anything they tell you to do. If they tell you to fetch, you fetch.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci's portrayal is off the charts, one of the greatest movie performances ever, and his ""you think I'm funny"" is one of the greatest scenes in all of movie history.<br/><br/>Paul Sorvino is brilliant as Paul Cicero.<br/><br/>Lorraine Bracco's performance was a revelation.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta are awesome."

","Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is a small time gangster, who takes part in a robbery with Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito, two other gangsters who have set their sights a bit higher. His two partners kill off everyone else involved in the robbery, and slowly start to climb up through the hierarchy of the Mob.<br/><br/>I am impressed with how closely the film follows the book, with some lines seemingly coming across exactly. If Pileggi's book is accurate, this film is also accurate. (As an organized crime historian, I can confidently say that Pileggi's book is among the best-written accounts of mob life ever put to paper.) Some say this is Scorsese's best film. I tend to prefer ""Gangs of New York"", but this could go either way."

Its a pity that people have to listen to the comments of critics to form their own opinions.

Set to a true-to- period rock soundtrack, the story details the rise and fall of Hill, a half-Irish, half-Sicilian New York kid who grows up idolizing the ""wise guys"" in his impoverished Brooklyn neighborhood. He begins hanging around the mobsters, running errands and doing odd jobs until he gains the notice of local chieftain Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino), who takes him in as a surrogate son. As he reaches his teens, Hill (Ray Liotta) is inducted into the world of petty crime, where he distinguishes himself as a ""stand-up guy"" by choosing jail time over ratting on his accomplices. From that moment on, he is a part of the family. Along with his psychotic partner Tommy (Joe Pesci), he rises through the ranks to become Paulie's lieutenant; however, he quickly learns that, like his mentor Jimmy (Robert DeNiro), his ethnicity prevents him from ever becoming a ""made guy,"" an actual member of the crime family. Soon he finds himself the target of both the feds and the mobsters, who feel that he has become a threat to their security with his reckless dealings. Goodfellas was rewarded with six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture; Pesci would walk away with Best Supporting Actor for his work."

","A fantastic, raw movie about mob life. Instead of glamorizing, this film shows it as it really is --- it can appear glamorous at times, but there are a lot of rough patches as well, and those have to be taken into account. People can get hurt from all directions. People can get careless. People can get overconfident. And then, people can be removed from their pedestals by force...<br/><br/>If I had to reward the best actor in this film, I would have to go with Joe Pesci. He portrayed the psychopathic, insecure, bigger-than-life, living time bomb Tommy DeVito so well, especially the chilling way Tommy could snap like a twig when a remark rubbed him the wrong way, as well as the chilling, casual take that Tommy took when he carried out a murder, like it was comedic and normal to him. Just... chilling is the only word I can think of. The way the actors responded to him was amazing, too; every time Tommy looked like he was a little angry, everybody ducked for cover and simultaneously pretended like they were still having a great time when they were actually all PETRIFIED with fear. I lost myself in his character, who I actually found to be incredibly intriguing. While EVERY character made me forget that I was watching a movie (I felt like I was watching Henry Hill's life from behind his own eyes), Tommy DeVito brought the whole film to a new kind of life that has NEVER happened to me before. Pesci won and fully deserved his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Well done.<br/><br/>As I said before, every actor is fantastic. Ray Liotta perfectly portrayed Henry Hill's subtly innocent personality; Henry always felt like a bystander, like he wasn't fully engaged in the perfect storm surrounding him, and Ray Liotta portrayed that part of Henry perfectly. Likewise, Robert DeNiro flawlessly portrayed Jimmy 'The Gent' Conway's paranoid, secret, and subtly violent personality. At the same time that he seemed like a friend, he also seemed like an enemy and a traitor, scheming behind your back to ruin you and keep the riches to himself.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is, simply put, amazing. Every song fits its corresponding scene perfectly, especially the dreamy ""Beyond the Sea"" while things seem to be going well for the wise guys in prison, ""Rags to Riches"" to give a strong, powerful kickoff to the film, and especially ""What is Life,"" during Henry's frantic last day before his life collapses, but the token song on the soundtrack would have to be ""Sunshine of Your Love."" I will always get chills during a moment that I call one of my favorite movie moments of all time, courtesy of one of the greatest directors in history, the masterful Martin Scorsese: when Jimmy takes a drag on a cigarette and glares at Morrie while the beginning of ""Sunshine of Your Love"" plays in the background, and Morrie is dancing and singing a cheery song, Irish folk anthem ""Danny Boy,"" like a bird, without knowing what fate awaits him. That always gives me chills.<br/><br/>I have a remark to the people who say that Goodfellas glamorizes violence and mob life. I think that the direction Scorsese was taking with the film was NOT to glamorize violence and mob life, but to show the domino effect that mob life has on the people on the inside. Jimmy 'The Gent' started with everything --- too much money to count, prestige, security, and comfort. So did Henry and Paulie. Then the reality of mob life hit them, and the walls started crumbling, and things weren't so beautiful after that. The film shows the imperfections in mob life, especially the imperfections that most contemporary counts seem to gloss over.<br/><br/>Overall, this is my favorite movie for a myriad of reasons. It's a beautifully raw film, and I will always love it every time I see it. No film that I've ever seen can beat this MASTERPIECE... yet."

","Goodfellas is a movie that if it came out yesterday it would be just as relevant and impressive. It has stood the test of time and is still the greatest mobster movie, surpassing The Godfather in my opinion, and I would argue is the greatest movie of all time. The back-way restaurant scene still works beautifully and has I have seen it repeated and mimicked constantly. A must watch for any movie lover. Martin Scorsese has had an amazing career with other fantastic films such as The Departed, Gangs of New York, Casino, Raging Bull, and Taxi Driver. It is not a coincidence that Robert DeNiro has appeared in 4 of these as he has been excellent in all of them starting with Mean Streets. His peak was arguably Goodfellas as well as Ray Liotta who has had trouble duplicating his success of the years. With such an impressive filmography, for Goodfellas to stand out among them really proves just how amazing it was. A must watch for a Scorsese fan, DeNiro fan, Liotta fan, mobster fan, and a movie fan."

","Goodfellas is quite possibly the coolest movie ever made. It has the coolest clothes, cars, actors and a terrific storyline. This is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece. Featuring a terrific set of performances from Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and of course Joe Pesci this movie is one of the all-time classics.<br/><br/>Based on a true story the storyline of the movie takes place between the years 1955 and 1980 we follow the storyline of Henry Hill(Ray Liotta) a small time crook that finds himself being wound up in the mafia. The story also focuses on his relationship with Jimmy Conway(Robert De Niro, the psychotic Tommy Devito( Joe Pesci)and his relationship with his wife Karen ( Lorraine Branco.<br/><br/>There is so many good things about this movie and it's hard to talk about everything in one review. I think the acting and writing particularly stand out. Liotta does a fantastic job as you're never sure if you want to like the guy or hate his guts. He's the perfect antihero and Liotta performs this perfectly. De Niro is fantastic as Hill's mentor but the icing on the cake is Joe PesciI ( who picked up the film's only Oscar). Playing the ultimate psychopath he's one of the most unpredictable characters ever in film. You never know what he's going to do and Pesci plays this perfectly.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also excellent. Lorraine Branco is very good as the wife of Henry Hill ( the only normal person in the entire movie"". Paul Sorvino is also great as one of the capos. There's also a few famous faces before they became famous e.g. Samuel L Jackson as well as about two dozen people from the Sopranos such as Michael Imperoli, Tony Sirico and Frank Vincent.<br/><br/>The directing and camera-work is superb from Scorsese and the writing is excellent with many quotable lines. Overall Goodfellas is a masterpiece of cinema and should be remembered as one of the all time greats of cinema. It was fantastic 23 years ago and it is still fantastic now."

","Goodfellas is the best way to see the mafia, with Godfather given you a thrill of what the mafia life is about from the top; Goodfellas gives you the view of it from the bottom, as we see three guys work their way to the top.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is based on New York crime reporter's (Nicholas Pileggi) non- fictional book Wiseguy, about the life of Henry Hill.<br/><br/>Goodlfellas starts in the middle and moves backwards then forward. The screenplay was done by both Scorsese and Pileggi, who had to pull out 12 different drafts before they finally wound up with the script that was used to shoot the film.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the life of Henry Hill; Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) always wanted to be a gangster, to help him along the way he got a job with a mob boss when he was in high school and there he met two other gangsters Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) with whom he grew up with and they took part in many crimes in the city.<br/><br/>After being involved in a heist that took America by storm, the group decided to kill off everyone else involved in the robbery, and slowly start to climb up through the hierarchy of the Mob. <br/><br/>Boasting of a notable cast of Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas is noted as one of the greatest films ever made in the crime genre and during its initial box office success run it was nominated for six Academy Awards, which included Best Picture and Best Director for Scorsese. In the Oscar's Goodfellas went home with one award for Joe Pesci in the Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The film also got notable acclaim in the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, winning five awards including Best Film and Best Director.<br/><br/>Goodfellas was Scorsese's most expensive film to date although the movie budget is small compared to other movies of such standard and was well received by critics holding a 97% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and it is ranked the second greatest gangster film by AFI (American Film Institute) behind Godfather (1972) and before Godfather Part II (1974).<br/><br/>Goodfellas is a good watch any day any time and it will always standout as one of the best adaptation of mafia life, one you will like to own along side Godfather.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"kjarvis1212","10","0","1","9 February 2012"," An American Classic
","Goodfellas achieves stunning success where most gangster films fail; it balances the reality of mob violence and thuggery with emotion and charm. Based on true events, Martin Scorsese's masterpiece depicts the life and times of a group of Mafiosos over the course of several decades. The film's centerpiece is Henry Hill, played by a never better Ray Liotta. Hill grew up desperate to become a gangster, but remains on the outside looking in due to his half-Irish heritage. Still, he manages to carve out quite a niche for himself in the ""family,"" thanks to his mobbed-up buddies, played by Oscar winners Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci. After years of friendship and keeping each other's secrets, Hill finds himself boxed in as the heat turns up, leaving him with some difficult decisions to make. Aside from the Godfather film series and the Sopranos television series, you won't find a more accurate portrayal of the New York Mafia. The direction and production are flawless, as are the performances, including bit roles that often steal the scene. If you haven't seen it, shame on you. Yes, it's violent (the opening scene involves a brutal stabbing of an already-shot victim), but the acting and the story itself are more than enough to justify a viewing, even for the squeamish."
"rightaboveit011","9","0","1","5 December 2011"," Great by all means, but not the best
","As a huge fan of Scorsese's 2000s movies Goodfellas seemed right up my alley. Indeed, the measure of greatness of Scorsese movies is how they stack up against this classic and the question is often what is his best since.<br/><br/>So my expectations were high to say the least. There are some scenes in Goodfellas which would make me proud to have it included in my list of top movies - from intimidating the mailman by shoving his head in the oven to Tommy's reckless blasting away of ""Spider"" over a trifle, to Henry Hill waking up to his wife pointing a gun in his face, and, my favourite scene, when Tommy is shot dead and blood flows slowly from his head out over the floor.<br/><br/>And I could go on listing scenes. This is exactly the point - there is something lacking, even poor, in the story as a whole i.e. in the pace of the film. Henry following Tommy along to the double date is a turning point in the narrative, with Karen coming into the story at this point. The initial scene at the restaurant just seems to fit in as another part of the lengthy orientation. Then the two have an argument on the street - again it all seems to fit in. Then all of a sudden Henry's voice-over tells us that he finds her attractive and Karen's opinion somehow changes and they decide they'll go out, this time on a proper date - this is way too unrealistic. The awkwardness of the first date is conveyed so well, with the contrast between Tommy and his girl, and the voice-over from Karen, that it's fair to wonder why she even wanted to go on the second date. After the Copacabana date you can believe that she was impressed with him but I'm sure most people found it odd that she wasn't repelled to begin with and got caught up in the whole thing. It takes ages for anything narratively significant to happen, and when it does it's out of nowhere.<br/><br/>The film seems to be confused what its emphasis is. The opening scene is taken out from a late point in the movie, giving it that mystery-movie style revelation when we realise the context of that scene. This is inappropriate - by the time we figure out what that scene was about we know that the gangsters kill people all the time, and sometimes over practically nothing, especially Tommy. There's too much of a similarity between the murders of Spider and Billy Batts to give special importance to Batts; sure, Spider was a nobody and Batts was a ""made"" man, but there should have been more done to show why Batts was more serious. The filmmakers couldn't have expected audiences to grasp the intenseness of killing a made man. <br/><br/>Goodfellas isn't a movie about the Lufthansa heist, not really. The filmmakers obviously chose to sacrifice a traditional story for an in depth, more holistic view of mob life. The cost is that the climax lacks some depth. The filmmakers were never interested in the heist, they were interested in its aftermath, because that's where the characters interrelate. All those involved are slowly killed off by Jimmy Conway, and in the sense that we finally see the fullness of Jimmy's gangster quality (besides throwing 100s to operating doormen and bartenders) there is some interest and drama. But this is compromised because the heist is an opportunity that the gangsters merely stumble upon - there is no reason or meaning involved in the actual robbery besides their normal greed. Jimmy Conway has nothing personal in it, no journey towards it, and it is this extra psychological depth that would have made the ending truly masterful. The filmmakers, and hence the audience, are too caught up in the characters' relations to think about them individually.<br/><br/>A lot will disagree with this, but I think The Departed is better. It has all the same great hallmarks of directing but it has a masterfully crafted story that isn't spontaneous and doesn't drag (even though The Departed is longer) and it is psychologically deep (the main female character is a psychologist, what more could you want?). This said, Goodfellas is a quality movie and a proud part of the Scorsese canon, and if a friend came and told me he recently watched it I would still light up and be ready to talk about all the amazing scenes.<br/><br/>In short, to be a Masterpiece, EVERYTHING has to go right - and although there are lots of awesome films there are few masterpieces, and Goodfellas is definitely an example of the former and not the latter."

""Even better than VIPS"".I guess that is one of the most attractive aspects of the Mafia.Have everything you please..wow!!<br/><br/>The movie received so much praise and consideration on being maybe the greatest mob movie ever!!now lets not exaggerate here. i take nothing away from this motion picture,its pretty good and has a great cast:Ray Liotta,Joe Pesci,Robert De Niro and Paul Sorvino all of which gave tremendous performances no doubt....the PLOT!now thats were the problem is!!The first time i saw it,i only managed to watch half of it and i was impressed.When i got round to see it all i was left frustrated.From then on i lost that appetite to watch it again..Let me Explane. The first half starts off well and stylish,Henry's introduction as a kid in the Lucchese crew,or when he meets and marries Karren.. everything up until the whacking of Billy Batts is good..but from then on the story starts losing its magic and going off track.The end seemed a little unclear and rushed!!The second half of the film seemed detached and completely different from the first half.<br/><br/>One aspect of the film that i didn't tolerate was the excessive use of the F-word.""Blime me"",it was used well 246 times.!!!Half way through you get sick of hearing it.well more than sick ""Tired"" is the best word. this is not Scorsese's only movie mind you that the f-word is used on a frequent basis,try the Departed or CASINO where Joe Pesci says 21 F****S less than 2 minutes!!Scorsese specialty i suppose.<br/><br/>To call Goodfellas the greatest mob movie ever is over the top.For me there are superior gangster movies out there such as Coppola's Godfathers 1 and 2 or Sergio Leones Once upon a time in America. the movie that I'm reviewing now is good but i don't agree on it being a masterpiece..it falls short by miles!!! I'm most probably in the vast minority here for not admiring it but hey everyone has got their own opinions and thoughts. I'll definitely go back to it in future and re watch it and maybe have a different idea on it,but for the time being this gangster flick cant even be mentioned in the same breath of the GODFATHER and the GODFATHER PART 2!! NOW THATS A FACT!!!"

","Christmas. The time of year where hearing one more carol or watching one more commercial for frozen ham will surely send anyone over the edge. It's also the time that almost every major film studio tries their hand at making a quick buck by releasing some generic, light- hearted holiday movie you've probably seen in some form already. I don't care for these films at all, which is why I have all the more reason to thank Fox Classics for their Spotlight On Scorsese Week, which ended last Friday with what is, in my opinion, the greatest film ever made by the greatest filmmaker alive today.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is the remarkably true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a young boy whose imagination is captured by the prospect of being a gangster. Fast forward thirteen years, and Henry has befriended local legends Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci, in an Oscar-winning performance) as part of the mafia. The rest of the film plays out as a rise-and-fall story as old as the Roman Empire, as Henry's addiction to the good life slowly consumes him and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco, whose role in this film led to her big break as Jen Melfi in The Sopranos).<br/><br/>Scorsese's two most recent feature films (Shutter Island and The Departed), while being quality efforts in their own right, are very different to his career-shaping masterpieces. They follow a structured plot, whereas his earlier movies tended to focus on a single character (or two) and a series of key moments in their existence, and what impact they had on the character's mental state or, indeed, life (think Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Casino). Goodfellas follows the same structure, progressing in a chronological fashion but only showing events worth documenting. It makes the film feel like less of a narrative and more of a biopic, but certainly dosen't detract from the entertainment. <br/><br/>Pesci is almost unanimously considered the standout, while the smaller-than-expected role played by De Niro makes one forget just how good an actor he really is. In fact, the very young Liotta almost seems overshadowed by his co-stars, despite being the lead actor. That is until the final Act, where he steals the show as a coked-up Henry, trying to get through the hectic day of a mobster while the rest of his life appears to crumble around him. His overt aggression and deep-seated paranoia contribute to his performance being the most realistic and poignant depiction of a person under the influence ever seen on film.<br/><br/>Goodfellas consists of some of the most inspired cinematography and editing ever to be seen. Indeed, what makes the use of the camera such a delight to watch is that it is almost a character in itself, so much does it reflect the tone of each scene. When Henry is in a rush to get his date back home, the film cuts from point A to point B showing nothing in between, to maintain an urgent pace. When he takes Karen to the Copacabana for the first time, the camera follows her so that the viewer feels the same sense of unfamiliarity and surprise at just how good Henry's life is as she does.<br/><br/>Finally, an excellent soundtrack perfectly compliments Henry's non-diegetic voice-over. Music by Tony Bennett, The Rolling Stones, Dean Martin, Donovan, Cream, Muddy Waters, The Who and Sid Vicious (and that's just scratching the surface) make enjoyable scenes memorable, and memorable scenes legendary. And while Goodfellas doesn't exactly promote peace on Earth and goodwill to your fellow man, I'll take it over The Search for Santa Paws any day of the festive season.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"

","Goodfellas is another brilliant picture from Scorsese. It blends in everything that makes a film great- entertaining scenarios, great dialogue, and a lot of climactic resolutions. Both Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci give incredible performances, and both veer into different types of characters. This isn't The Godfather in it's tone. It is much more energetic, more adrenaline-driven, and in a way more entertaining. De Niro is always great to have, but as far as his performances go this doesn't hold a candle to his best. The story all around is strong, although I wouldn't call it anything ground-breaking as far as other films of similar nature are concerned. But it does Scorsese's filmography proud."

","Such is the reputation of Goodfellas, that when I finally set about watching it a few months ago, I was sure of an unforgettable movie experience.<br/><br/>But I was bitterly disappointed. While by no means a bad movie, Goodfellas never touched the heights of The Godfather and The departed, two other movies about 'wiseguys'.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is a true story about Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who, since childhood was charmed by gangsters. He set about doing odd jobs for the mob as kid, and after being arrested ones and not ratting out, he earns the mob's respect. He then starts to enter the big time, befriending by Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci)<br/><br/>The movie never really took off for me, and never had me sucked into it, as I would expect all so-called classics to.Despite that, there are a few seminal scenes in it. The 'you're funny' scene is one of them, which probably was the main reason for Joe Pesci's Oscar as best supporting actor.<br/><br/>Credit has to be given to Scorese though, for sticking true to Henry Hill's story and not overtly dramatizing it.<br/><br/>The three central characters are in good form. Liotta does a great job of portraying the level-headed (compared to Conway and Tommy) gangster, while DeNiro's charisma is there for all to see as the flamboyant Jimmy Conway. However, Pesci is the star of the show, delivering a top performance as the hare-brained, hot tempered gangster Tommy DeVito.<br/><br/>While for me it wasn't good enough to be considered a classic, it's good enough to warrant a watch.<br/><br/>7/10"

","An enthusiastic adolescent stares longingly out of his bedroom window at the gangsters hangout, dreaming to be a gangster... Bunks school, works with them and eventually grows up to be one of them. This boy narrating his story is half Irish, half Italian, New York based mobster, Henry Hill(Ray Liotta). He is lashed by his father but he complains to the mob bosses who help him out. His mother looks at him in a suit and shrieks ""You look like a gangster!"" This scene marks his transformation into a ""WiseGuy"", one among the Goodfellas. How he grew up surrounded by the mafia and worked and lived off them for 3 decades forms the basis of this film.<br/><br/>Based on the book ""Wise Guy"" by reporter Nicholas Pileggi (to whom the real Henry Hill reportedly gave his true-life account), whose also penned the screenplay with Director Scorsese, the 146 min movie successfully packs 3 decades of mafia life without compromising on the pace or the details, thanks to the brilliant direction of Martin Scorsese and the editing(Thelma Schoonmaker).<br/><br/>The beauty of this movie was it was full of violence, murder, theft, smuggling, substance abuse, adultery, profanity and other unsocial acts, all of which were spoken of very casually in the same breath with no feeling of remorse or guilt. It delved deep into the subject of the power of Mafia but it never advocated their use or glorified it. Neither was it a typical moral bedtime story that are narrated to children. This is effectively expressed by the gradual change in the character of Hill's wife, Karen Hill(Lorraine Bracco) through her narration. She initially feels as uncomfortable as any outsider would feel with the movie's theme but slowly gets absorbed just as the viewer into the mafia lives and in certain places, even makes you feel a certain sympathy for the lead character and other people but leaves a stranger taste when you realise that all their sufferings are well deserved. They are casual with their criminal acts but deep down, they know they are wrong. And as Roger Ebert said, they know they are guilty, not because they did wrong but know that they want to do the wrong again.<br/><br/>The music & tempo(""Rags to Riches"", ""Pretend you don't see her"" and so on) seem hand picked for the occasions, perfectly echoing the mood of the scenes. In addition to this, the screenplay of some scenes(which I heard was mostly improvised by the actors, spot on) stand out for their sense of sheer brutal-ism while some for their humour while some others explaining a subtle point or thought or a transition in character.<br/><br/>The acting cast comprising of Robert DeNiro(Jim Conway), Joe Pesci(Tommy DeVito), Paulie Cicero(Paul Sorvino), Ray Liotta(Henry Hill), Lorraine Bracco(Karen Hill) ...the list goes on....put an earnest performance. We also have some interesting small-time roles played by significant actors - Ed Stacks (Samuel Jackson), old Vinnie(Martin's father, Charles Scorsese), Tommy's mother(Martin's mother, Catherine Scorsese), Diane(Kate Wallach, daughter of legendary Eli Wallach of Good, Bad, Ugly fame) and so on...<br/><br/>I admit to first seeing this movie in bits and parts(as I heard it was one of Scorsese's best) as and when it was telecast on Television and wasn't very impressed but decided to hold my view until later. But when I got a chance to see it from start to end, I was impressed and mesmerized by this piece of art.<br/><br/>The primary goal of movie is to keep a viewer engaged through its runtime and leave the viewer with a feeling of having experienced a story which GoodFellas successfully does.<br/><br/>So, here we have a gangster movie ranking (almost) equivalent to the likes of Godfather.<br/><br/>9 / 10<br/><br/>(minus one, not because the movie was flawed, but as I respect the 10 stars for a once (or twice) in a lifetime movie - and I have chosen Fight Club for now)"

","In many ways the quintessential Scorsese picture, tying together all the director's favourite hobbyhorses and actors (The Mob, De Niro, the Rolling Stones), GoodFellas was the first great crime thriller of the 1990s - and a classic as soon as it opened.<br/><br/>Based on the memoir by stool pigeon Henry Hill, it has lost none of its chilly, seductive power with the passing of time, owing to career-defining turns from Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci - the latter so good he'd virtually reprise the role for Goodfellas' spiritual twin, Casino, along with a soundtrack to literally die for, bravura camera-work and some authentic, blackly funny dialogue.

I can certainly appreciate the movie for being quite possibly the most accurate mob movie in movie history. Nothing here is romanticized. They may have had a lot of perks, made a lot of money, but at what cost? That is ultimately the theme that is explored in ""Goodfellas""<br/><br/>However it is most definitely NOT for everyone. There is no justice, no happy ending, sometimes no rhyme of reason for the crimes that are committed, except that it's just the way of life. The people in the movie are not sympathetic, you won't like them. You won't like their friends. You won't like their enemies. For some people that can be frustrating, myself included. It's disturbing; some of the murders in this movie made me downright angry.

","No doubt that this is one of the best movies ever. It comes down to everything, and yes, it had downs, but very few downs.<br/><br/>The music in the movie was very well chosen, and also well chosen is ALL of the actors. Joe Pesci delivered the greatest performance in the movie as Tommy, the guy who took crap from nobody and refused to look like a moron. Robert De Niro was more than a perfect fit for Jimmy. The one up this movie has on a lot of other movies is that the actors WERE their characters(basically they were doing their jobs.) Goodfellas also delivered one of the most upsetting deaths to me. The death of Tommy. The most upsetting part about it was you didn't really see it coming. Thanks to this movie, every time I hear Gimme Shelter by the Rolling Stones I have a sudden urge to watch it(even though the song has appeared in two other Scorsese films.)<br/><br/>This is one of the films where you think ""who ever did this is a genius."" And that goes out for almost every Scorsese film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I highly recommend you watch Goodfellas if you already haven't. Definitely a must see.+"

","Based on real life it tells the tale of Henry Hill, who grows up to be a gangster, a soldier in the Italian Mafia. The film gives information on how the Mafia operates and the members, Martin Scorsese reveals the main players by giving them a back-story and showing how they came to be.<br/><br/>The film is very funny at times; yet it shows just how quick a gangsters life can be; there is no trust and shows how gangsters live there lives, paranoid. As you watch the film you begin to like the main three, Ray, Deniro and Pesci but when push comes to shove, friends can become enemies in an instant.

"galileo3","10","0","1","14 October 2007"," Scorsese's panoramic examination of the mob. Goodfellas is nothing less than a masterpiece.
","Goodfellas (1990)<br/><br/>Number 1 - 1990<br/><br/>Top 3 - 1990s <br/><br/>Top 30 - All Time <br/><br/>Top 5 - Gangster Films of All Time <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's long and distant masterpiece about the mob, is a cinematic colossus, an account of Henry Hill's life and, told in narrative by Hill (who is played flawlessly by a young and eager Ray Liotta), who openly tells us that ""as far as I could remember I always wanted to be a gangster""... Scorsese shows us why: A young Henry, living in a small flat, with his mother and siblings and his Irish father who was angry at his low life job and often channelled his rage by beating Henry.<br/><br/>Henry stares in awe, at the mafiosi across the street and their hedonistic lives with girls,fast cars, money and cops working for them. Hill gets a job across the street working for Pauli, and it all evolves from there...<br/><br/>Scorsese is the right man for this film. The man who knows the material so well through his experiences of growing up in Little Italy; this allowed Marty to observe and perhaps wonder about such operations such as crime and the people behind it.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is a Scorsese film for obvious reasons. The themes are evident all around; the troubled misguided leading characters, bonds of loyalty and betrayal, a strong element of Catholicism from the characters backgrounds and all the other themes that are incorporated into the film.<br/><br/>The character study in Goodfellas is perhaps the deepest Scorsese has ever reached, it is a riveting study of the operations, feelings, thoughts and actions of the Wiseguys, focusing on Henry Hill. The world of the Mafia and the values it withholds are fascinating and at times complex, but the film goes in out, left and right to study every single aspect of these people's lives.<br/><br/>Although I do prefer 'The Godfather' overall, Goodfellas is arguably better in many respects. It is a direct, unsavoury and often brutal display of the Mafia. Scorsese's film is a more modern gangster tale, where the industry has evolved into a more violent, more unglamorous and elaborate business from Coppola's mafia world.<br/><br/>The glamour and power that may come from the mafia lifestyle is contrasted by Scorsese, with the bloodshed, cheating and paranoia that follow Henry Hill and those around him as the film progresses...It is indeed the truth, that crime does not pay...<br/><br/>This film is another example of how Martin Scorsese films bring out the best in every actor, push everything a step further. Look at Robert De Niro in 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull', 'The King of Comedy'. Ellen Burstyn in 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore', Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York... Scorsese films are known for boosting actors to otherwise undiscovered levels...In this film, Liotta is strong and De Niro gives another masterclass, but it is perhaps Joe Pesci that outdoes himself with a calculated fleshy portrayal of Mafiosi Tommy De Vito, a man of outrageous violence...<br/><br/>This is a masterful film, and possibly the best films of the 1990s.<br/><br/>As Roger Ebert put it, Many of Scorsese's films have been poems about guilt. I leave it at that.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Some people opt for Mean Streets, some for Taxi Driver, some for Raging Bull, some for Goodfellas, some for The Departed, etc....<br/><br/>For me, the greatest Scorsese film is Goodfellas. While I feel Scorsese directed Raging Bull with more intensity and detail, his work on Goodfellas is still close but the script works better and the acting ensemble gives electrifying performances.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta was unfairly snubbed of an Oscar nomination for his star making turn here. It was probably because he didn't have a big profile like his co-star De Niro and other nominees that year like Jeremy Irons and Gerard Depardieu. It was a mistake on the Academy and the Globes and critics awards to not recognize him.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro gave an Oscar worthy performance that could've got him a Supporting nod. Paul Sorvino was good but was the weaker link out of the main cast....but still very good.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci created such a vile character and in the process won a very well deserved Oscar for it. His performance is very memorable and quite surprising.<br/><br/>Lorraine Bracco's Karen is probably the most sympathetic lead in the movie and she should've won an Oscar instead of Whoopi Goldberg (who should have won for The Color Purple). The scene where she threatens Ray Liotta after finding out that he is having an affair with Janet ""YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A WHORE!!"" Rossi and for it to backfire on her was incredible. She is a talented woman and I hope she gets more work now with The Sopranos over.<br/><br/>The script, the editing, the sound, the music, the cinematography, the acting, and the direction....all superb and Oscar worthy!!"
"Hashabubba","10","0","1","3 October 2007"," Wow!
","My initial reaction to seeing this film was simply ""wow""! Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas in an exciting and thrilling ride from start to finish, and Scorsese makes the experience breathtaking. Be prepared to be blown over by a director at the peak of his talents.<br/><br/>The plot is basically about a boy called Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta) who has dreams of becoming a gangster, and his dreams come true when he is employed by the tough (but paranoid) Jimmy Conway, (played by Robert De Niro). De Niro gives a magnificent performance, however Joe Pesic steals the show as the crazed psycho-path Tommy De Vito, who also gives a great performance (especally in the ""Am I Funny"" scene). As the plot progresses we see Henry being attracted to the mafia and he wants to be apart of it, but we then see the brutal reality of the attraction to the violent and dangerous mafia lifestyle.<br/><br/>This is a very well made film. The fast paced editing makes it very enjoyable and the scrip is full of terrific lines. This is without a doubt a must-see for all the crime/mafia film lovers out there. And is one of Scorsese's best films to date.<br/><br/>10/10"
"MOscarbradley","10","0","1","3 September 2007"," This might just be Scorcese's greatest film
","Some people favour ""Raging Bull"" but the biggest buzz you are likely to get from a Scorcese movie will come from ""Goodfellas"" and because of it his name will be indelibly linked with 'gangster' films for evermore. If ""The Godfather"" films, (well, parts 1 and 2 anyway), represent the greatest single achievement in the genre taken as a whole, ""Goodfellas"" is still probably the pinnacle of the old-fashioned gangster movie per se. It's based on fact, and by all accounts very accurately, but its genesis lies in the Warner Brothers films of the 1930's, (which, of course, were 'torn from the headlines', so to speak).<br/><br/>It is the story of a life, that of Henry Hill, lived in the pursuit of crime, seen first as a boy, (Christopher Serrone), and then as a man, (Ray Liotta). He's one of the narrators, (the other is his wife, who throws her own jaundiced eye on the events in her husband's life), and it is through him we get to know a host of Runyonesque-named wise-guys and goodfellas, (gangsters all). The difference, of course, is that Runyon made them cuddly whereas Scorcese and his co-writer Nicholas Pileggi, on whose book the film is based, makes them vicious. To most of these guys killing is second nature; they don't give a moment's thought to kicking a man to death or shooting a barhop dead for giving back-chat. And perhaps it is that impulsiveness that is their downfall. They can plan one of the biggest heists in US history but they can't control their tempers.<br/><br/>It is, then, a very violent, (and foul-mouthed), movie and I can see why it won't be everybody's bucket of blood but if you love movies at all you can't help but love ""Goodfellas"". Scorcese brings to bear on the film a true film-maker's virtuosity; he loves the process of making movies and it shows in every frame, in every shot. Coupled with his innate understanding of the community in which ""Goodfellas"" is set, he has made a masterpiece. Everyone is working at a peak here; the editor, Thelma Schoonmaker; the cinematographer, Michael Ballhaus; the cast, as well as Liotta, never better, De Niro, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco. It could be argued that without movies like ""Scarface"", (the Hawks version), and ""The Roaring Twenties"", ""Goodfellas"" might not have existed. Likewise, without ""Goodfellas"" would we ever have had ""The Sopranos""?"

","What can i say about Goodfellas. Martin Scorsese's best film. Ray Liottas best film. Joe Pescis best film. Best gangster movie ever. It not only explores the world of organized crime, but it's very very real. Much more real than the Godfather. The performances of Goodfellas are legendary. Ray Liotta provides a gripping performance narrating. He starts off as a young kid with big dreams. Becomes a big cheese and is raking it in. Then becomes a drug addicted paranoid crazy man. In the end, all his friends are gone and he lives a horrible life living in fear protected by the men he used to hate. Joe Pesci is very very scary as a foul mouthed psychopath. Bursting out with swears abuse and violence wherever and whenever. De Niro is quietly brilliant next to these stunning performances as a quiet yet very dangerous mobster. The cast in this movie all have great roles. Lorraine Brasco is great as Henry's wife.<br/><br/>This is more than just a gang movie. But a theory on life. You can either be a ""schnook"" and live your life constantly waiting for things or become powerful and get them straight away. Getting made is the way to achieve this. Tommy (Joe) almost had this but it was cruelly taken away. Jimmy could have lived to be an old wise man but was betrayed by Henry. And Henry could have lived a long prosperous life but his demons overwhelmed him and brought about his downfall. Betrayal, Lies, Money, Paranoia and Death. Five key elements in Goodfellas"

","Director Martin Scorse and a (good)organized crime story, ah what a fine way to spend an afternoon! Now, even any Italian American Organization has to agree with that one. The talent of Mr. Scorsese and his life proximity to the Earthy atmosphere of the Gangster Film make for a double-barrel dose of the what is both familiar and yet strange to us all. The unique niche in the annals of film genres that is occupied by the Gangster Movie is truly a study in one end of the spectrum meeting the other end somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>The Gangster film seems to be one Film Genre that everyone enjoys. Perhaps it is that there is a clue in the film, itself. At one point, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta)in describing what it is to be a gangster says(in fine voice-over form), ""...we were like Movie Stars with muscle!"" That must be it, for I can well recall as a kid prefer being Al Capone to being Elliott Ness.<br/><br/>In Director Scorsese's capable hand, we have the True Master. His is the mind to not only select a story for adaptation to the screen. The settings and the stories are great.(Being a native New Yorker, he knows this terrain, like no other.) But friend Martin has one secret weapon at his disposal that gave his work the final edge of so many others.<br/><br/>Mr. Scorsese makes use of all sorts of seemingly commonplace techniques, combined and then given an even greater effectiveness by these combination of these. Hence, using the hand held camera with the subjective lens, then combining it with crisp, short bursts of voice over, is used to create a sense of here and now that is virtually unseen elsewhere..<br/><br/>But this Director does not push it. He knows that he should just give us so much of this business, and then he abruptly switches gears. This is done several times during the course of the film and is particularly effective in getting out a lot of exposition material and advancing the story.<br/><br/>Bringing a full three dimensional look and feel to the characters he presents to us is where an awful lot of other film makers are left behind in the dust. Any character in GOOD FELLAS is complex and multi-faceted. Plenty of time and care is expended in an effort to make each character into something besides being just another character. There is not any room for the shallow, the one sided, the 'stock' or stereo-typed in Martin Scorsese's World.<br/><br/>So, we see a Henry, who would do a 'Hit', yet is caring and loving in personally protecting and comforting a frightened, molested Karen. Paulie who holds the powers of Judge and Exicutioner over so many low level syndicate 'soldiers' and 'wannabees', yet is gentle and protective to the multitude of his adoring nieces and nephews. Even Tommy, who is clearly 'not playing with a full deck' and could fly off the handle and kill for absolutely no reason, is still kind and respectful to his poor, old white haired Mother.<br/><br/>Only Jimmy Conway(DeNiro)seems to be lacking in any real, even half-fast good points to his personality. In the final analysis, is it he who is the worst of the bad guys? What is it that he lacks to leave him so inadequate as a person? There is one other element that seems to permeate all of Master Builder Scorsese's finished products. Mr. Scorsese always has had the ability to bring his characters just one step beyond what we would expect. He has displayed the good judgment to make his characters identifiable with us, the movie going public. This he accomplishes by bridging any existing gaps between us and the on-screeners. No matter how different we are, he manages to bring a sense of identification to us.<br/><br/>Hence, regardless of personal station in life (Low-life Gangster, Caveman-like Prize fighter or enigmatic billionaire tycoon) or any difference in ethnicity(Italian,Irish,Jewish, Black, etc.)we identify with these characters. I mean, I forget just how many people, who we know, said that they were reminded of someone from their own life experiences from Joe Pesci's characterization."
"KlinePatsy","10","0","1","5 August 2007"," Movie perfection
","A gripping, shocking, at times shamefully hilarious, mob masterpiece, with a soundtrack so brilliantly chosen, you'd be forgiven for thinking all the songs were written just for this movie. The lightning pace never lets up as we follow the criminal career of the kid Henry Hill, as he blossoms from a scrawny mob-gopher into a streetwise foot soldier for the local Sicilian gangsters. It's a cautionary tale about the excesses of the American dream. All the major characters hold the world in their hands, but the inevitable backlash comes as the death toll rises and the money-making schemes become more grandiose...add some drugs, turf wars and extra-marital affairs into the mix..as well as the plain psychotic artistry of the more uncompromising villains (Pesci at his finest), and you've got a frenzied free-for-all on the streets of New York, as the gangster life tears up anyone and anything in its path. It's a wild ride, even if it's apparent where we're heading. Liotta adds a supremely good voice over which sets everything in context and slips you right into his edgy world, where every day is a constant hustle requiring wit, skill and courage. It's not a film for the faint hearted. While we are seduced by the wild world of organised crime, there are enough reality checks, in terms of the violence, to put us at an appropriate distance from the corrupt, morally redundant world that we are experiencing. Henry Hill is no Alex De Large, there's little ambiguity involved. He chooses the life and he pays for it in spades by the end. But the acting is so convincing, the story so well paced and delivered, that we have no time to reconsider our initial empathy for this bunch of villains. The cast is strong. Liotta performs an acting miracle as he holds onto the reins, occasionally being outshone by the electrifying Pesci, and the quietly malevolent De Niro...but never letting go of the story as his character ploughs on to the end. The supporting cast is brilliant So many memorable secondary characters, from Karen Hill, Mob boss Paulie, Morrie the wig-shop owner with grand ideas, henchman Carbone and many more. It's movie perfection..the blend of storytelling savvy, pitch=perfect performances, great music, elaborate camera-work and brilliant set design..It captures an era convicingly, and with an objectivity that really elevates it into a classic work of art."

","""Goodfellas"" is another gangster movie featuring Italian-American mobsters and possesses several parallels with ""The Godfather"" in the way it depicts mob life. ""Goodfellas"" is a more realistic movie that de-mythologises gangster life, showing it to be dangerous and highly unpredictable, drenched in blood and ambition. There is not even the faintest whiff of romanticism that you might find in ""The Godfather"".<br/><br/>The story follows Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his rise in late 60s and 70s New York to become a 'made man' among the mob. Along the way he finds himself working for Tommy Cicero (Paul Sorvino), the local mob boss, and alongside characters such as Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).<br/><br/>Nearly every recognisable gangster character actor in the US makes an appearance in this picture, (excluding Al Pacino and Marlon Brando). All the actors in this picture acquit themselves admirably. I can't say Liotta is in the same acting league as DeNiro or Pesci, whom he's frequently seen alongside. He just lacks the charisma to give the movie a strong enough centre. He is a good actor, but much of the time his performance seems hollow compared to the others.<br/><br/>Martin Scorcese directs in fine style, including several daring long shots that follow Henry and his friends in and about their business. Script and storyline are also very good, and spring one or two surprises on the audience.<br/><br/>I'm not as fond of this as I am of ""The Godfather"" but nevertheless it is a fine picture."

","I really enjoyed this movie and I thought it was very well done. A lot of people rave about some of the acting, but I think Ray Liotta did a pretty bad job and some scenes were just not right. I think it was extremely well directed and the long scene when Henry goes into the jazz club was perfect. I wouldn't even know how to set up a shot like that. I am not a director, but I cannot imagine it being easy with so many extras and and the timing must have been a nightmare. It really does set up the movie very well. I loved Tommy's character and being played by a smaller man makes it understandable why he was so crazy. I think the music was perfect. It started out with some great jazz vocals and then when one hears ""Cocaine"" riff in the background one knows everyone's lives are going to go to hell. I liked how it ended with a punk song. Such a good soundtrack. The way the scenes were cut were great. The first part of the movie started with a lot of long cuts that were smooth and then it got sharper and much more frantic. Full props to Martin (I don't know how to spell his last name) and I liked the use of actual people involved in the case. The one problem I have with this movie is that I cannot relate to any of the characters or what they are going through. The motivations even if they are real seemed silly and it is like a bunch of kids on a playground. No one could do that movie better and the casting of Ray Liota was the only thing I would have changed and it will be timeless, but I cannot relate to it."

","Everyone in their right mind knows that Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time and that his depiction of 'gangster' movies is second to none. This comes from his upbringing which he so brilliantly translates onto the screen. No one can translate the passion and emotion like Scorsese can from his past experiences onto the screen. Although Scorsese leaves his footprints in every movie he makes, his most pertinent footprints are left in the films Mean Streets(1973) and Goodfellas(1990). Scorsese grew up in ItalianAmerican New York. That being said, he is a master at conveying the lies, deception, and greed which occurs in regular 'gangster' life. Goodfellas mainly focuses in on the life of Henry Hill portrayed by Ray Liotta. It follows him from a young boy, through his dealings with the mob, his drug addiction and jail time, and to his eventual court case and permanent stay in the witness protection program. Goodfellas is full of sheer drama, a taste of guns knives, and a whole lot of raw gangster lifestyle beautifully portrayed by Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro. These three, combined with Scorsese seemingly give the movie its color. In terms of gangster films, nothing can compare with the realistic atmosphere which Scorsese continues to create time and time again."

","Goodfellas<br/><br/>My ultimate review starts now. In my opinion this is the greatest movie ever. I saw Goodfellas about 18 months ago and liked it. I watched it again and loved it and was inspired by it. This movie does everything close to perfect.<br/><br/>Plot: The story is about a man named Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta who is pulled into the clutches of the mob world. It is based on a true story and the book Wiseguys. The story is great with just a few minor strayings from the true story which it is based off of.<br/><br/>Acting: The acting is great. Ray Liotta gives what should have been an Oscar-Nominated performance as Henry Hill. He narrates as Henry Hill as well. Joe Pesci gives an Oscar-Winning performance as the brutal and vicious Tommy DeVito based on Thomas DeSimone. Lorraine Bracco gives a great performance as Henry Hill's wife, Karen Hill. Robert De Niro didn't give as good of a performance as he did in Taxi Driver and Raging Bull but still gave a fantastic performance. Also Paul Sorvino was really good.<br/><br/>Genre/Quality: As a crime film this movie excels every step of the way. It starts by showing some of the positive things living in a life of crime. However it soon shows the dirty and brutal side of it. In the end crime doesn't pay. The movie's quality is amazing. Martin Scorsese directs his best movie yet and deserved best director at the Oscars. Thelma Schoonmaker edits beautifully. Like every movie this movie has mistakes but the movie is so good you might forget about the mistakes.<br/><br/>Overall this is to me the greatest movie ever made.

He works along side Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). He is married to Karen Hill (Lorraine Brancco). He defiantly has the life and everything else. Still, he gets in with drugs and that starts his downfall. I was truly inspired that Joe Pesci could say that many f-bombs (in the whole movie they said 246),even though he get's whacked. The directing is superb, the editing great, the score rocking, and the acting top-notch. I mean, this is one of the best acting ensembles I have ever seen! I will go to my grave thinking that Marty deserved best director for this movie, and that Goodfellas deserved best picture of 1990.

One of my personal favourites is the ""I didn't mean to get blood on your floor Henry."" or, after a brief speech from Paulie: ""Hey Karen, I got the most expensive tree they had."" I could go on forever. As I am writing this I keep thinking of other unforgettable moments that I could mention. Why do you need me telling you about this movie? Go rent, or better yet, buy the special edition 2 disc DVD. I'll leave you with a quote from a notable critic when speaking about another Scorcese movie I can't wait to see, ""The Departed."" He said, ""The Departed is probably the second best mid level mob movie I have ever seen. The only reason I say this is the second best is because of Goodfellas.""<br/><br/>I think I'll pop Goodfellas in the DVD player and watch it for the 50th time. Happy viewing."
"dwpeak","10","0","1","24 January 2007"," A Classic Gangster Picture
","Martin Scorsese is one of the best filmmakers who ever lived, if not the greatest. ""GoodFellas"" is one of his best movies. It is energetically violent, and full of language and drug content. Does that make the film what it is? No. It is a great study of organized crime from 1955 to 1970. It is real and it is haunting.<br/><br/>Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) grew up in Brooklyn. As he narrates, he makes it apparent that the life he always wanted to lead was the gangster life. He lives across from a cab stand owned by some ""wiseguys."" Henry gets a job there, and suddenly becomes so engulfed in the life, that he misses school for months. He spends his childhood finding ways to score money, and learn the Mafia routine as taught to him by Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino). He obviously gets older Hill remains a gangster, and the film is about his life growing up surrounded by violence and corruption. It is the story of how something so glamorous could be so ugly.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta gives the best performance of his career as Henry Hill. No other role he has had comes close to this one. Robert De Niro pulls off a fascinating job, as well. Joe Pesci plays the profane Tommy, a long time friend of Jimmy and Henry, in his Oscar-winning performance. A surprising addition to a great cast. Lorraine Bracco plays Karen, Henry's wife. She had a difficult role, considering her character's personality, but she did a great job. Paul Sorvino is superb as Cicero, and gives one of the film's best performances.<br/><br/>""GoodFellas"" is based on a true story novel by Nicholas Pileggi. Pileggi, along with Scorsese, developed a truly amazing screenplay, that few can match with its wonderful voice-over narration and stunning dialogue.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is a truly skilled director. Not many directors can match is sense of style and darkness. Every scene is worked to utter mastery. <br/><br/>The film, in the end, is great. There's not much to argue about there. This film will turn viewers away with its graphic violence and language, but the film is not without its messages. Mainly about the study of how one's life can be turned inside out by the decisions he/she makes. Or redeemed by those decisions. ""GoodFellas"" is vibrant, alive, exciting, and raw. It is a smart look at skilled film-making. A brilliant must-see."
"kitteh_harbls","10","0","1","24 January 2007"," Perfection presented in a tangible state
","...which is hard to say. This is one of those all-too-rare moments where the praise showered upon a movie truly lives up to its hype. The accolades and critical acclaim this movie has been receiving (and will continue to receive) are truly deserved. Teenyboppers, however, don't attend, please. Anyone who was dying to watch Britney's Crossroads movie: steer clear, otherwise you'll feel a compelling urge to come here on IMDb's board and voice your idiocy to the whole world in the ever-so-repetitive: ""THIS MOVIE IZ OVERRATED"".<br/><br/>Here are the reasons this movie is considered by me and many others (including critics and movie buffs) to be one of the greatest movies ever made:<br/><br/>(1) Martin Scorsese. He's the director, and he's the number one reason this movie is so, so good. There are three factors that make Marty a master of his craft (in no particular order): first, he has vision. Talent. The stuff. He has what it takes to be a director. He knows what to do, where to do it, when to do it and how to do it. He knows what works and what doesn't work. He knows when something is almost good (hence push it to be good) or overdone (hence take it down a notch). That's the first factor of his greatness: talent, and skill. Second, his amazing attention to detail. In his movies, everything has to be just PERFECT. 'Nuff said about this. Third (and his one sets him apart from the majority of the great directors), he has a rare (perhaps perfectly unique) ability to direct the WORST actors and absolute novices and turn them into acting gods and goddesses. I do not think there has been any director, past or present, that has this ability. Marty ensures that every single line, body movement, facial expression, voice tone and what have you are convincing...to the extreme. The realism of it, in fact, can be so creepy (seen Taxi Driver?). Sharon Stone's first nomination came late in her career (in 1995) when Marty directed her. Marty directed a new actress (Cathy Moriarity) in Raging Bull and had her nominated for an Oscar. The same for Joe Pesci in the same movie (he was new back then). When Pesci won his first Oscar, it was Scorsese who directed him (in this very movie, Goodfellas). <br/><br/>(2) The cast. This is the second reason this movie is so great. Joe Pesci is a psychotically violent thug, Ray Liotta as the lead in this biographical picture (mostly biographical, with quite a few artistic liberties), DeNiro as Liotta's take-no-prisoners boss, and most importantly (for me anyway), Paul Sorvino, as the capo regime for the big crime family he's working for. He heads this group of thugs and they all report to him. Sorvino delivered one of the scariest, most intimidating performances EVER, in any movie. The terror he strikes into your heart as the feared, imposing mob boss is matched by very few in other mob movies. Even Don Vito Corleone had a softer, more courteous, more diplomatic side. Paulie Cicero (Sorvino's character, based on a real mobster called Paul Vario), however, is terrifically intimidating. I remember an interview with Paul Sorvino (a few years ago) in which he says some Goodfellas fans tremble when they meet him, still shaken up by his dead-on performance. And, I don't blame them. Incidentally, let me combine the first point and the second point to produce this little back-up trivia: during the course of the movie, Sorvino improvises a slap to Liotta's face, which he receives with a stunned, surprised look against Sorvino's static, icey face. That slap was real, and Liotta didn't know it was coming. Scorsese left it in the movie because of that reason. That's a demonstration of point 1 (Scorsese's brilliance and attention to detail) and 2 (the cast, i.e. Sorvino's emotionless, scary look in this case).<br/><br/>(3) The story. The story this movie is based on is real. However, not every single thing in this movie happened. There were some liberties taken; some improvisations and some modifications. In any case, the story is superbly immersive and interesting. To top it all off, the movie runs at past 2 hours, so you get a heavy dose of movie pleasure.<br/><br/>(4) The music. The period music was used to perfection, although this can belong to point #1, but I thought it deserves its own point. The first song you hear (along with a paused shot of Ray Liotta's face) is ""Rags to Riches"" by Tony Bennet, which really sets the mood for the movie at its beginning and adds a little preview at the same time (the story is about Henry Hill's rise to power from a small, underprivileged family). The songs are matched brilliantly to the scenes and chosen with utmost care. <br/><br/>So, dear reader, these are the four main points that I believe made this movie what it is: a cinematic masterpiece and one of the greatest movies ever made. Inevitably, and because of the movie's supreme power and brilliance, it will always be compared to the Godfather, but the two are essential different. Whereas Goodfellas is the story of one man's journey through crime, the Godfather is about a whole family's ups and downs. The term ""mob movie"" is applied very loosely to the two. It's just a general label. So, it's futile to compare them, because they're two superb pictures. But a personal observation of mine is that the Godfather is great as a whole, whereas Goodfellas outshines it in many little details that make it more than the sum of its parts. Beyond that, they're both great and neither is better than the other, so to speak.<br/><br/>The movie's violent though, so it ain't for the squeamish. But that's all irrelevant. Those are just little post-it notes on the back cover of a whole book on how to make movies that time will eternally remember."
"ddtherrm","Null","0","2","21 January 2007"," Pizza oven
","In what has become, deservedly so one of the best mob movies ever there is a mistake that has always bugged me. During the scene near the beginning of the movie where they take the mailman into the pizza parlor and threaten him with putting his head in the oven if he delivers any more mail to Henry's house, the mailman's hand is on the inside of the door of the pizza oven. And I believe his other hand is on the top of the oven. Since most pizza ovens are kept at a temperature of 500 or more degrees Fahrenheit it would have been impossible to keep his hand on the inside of the oven door since the door would be just as hot as the oven. Even the outside top of the oven would have been way too hot to leave one's hand on. Obviously they used an oven that was not turned on to make the scene."

"Jimmie_twotimes","10","0","1","10 December 2006"," One of the best films ever made
","While Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" saga focuses on the highest levels of a crime family, Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" tells the story of a family from the lower levels.<br/><br/>The story starts in Brooklyn 1955 where young Henry Hill becomes an errand boy for the local mobsters. He meets and becomes friends with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and young Tommy DeVito. He earns the respect of the crew after he is pinched for selling illegal cigarettes and doesn't rat out his friends.<br/><br/>We then flash forward to Henry (Ray Liotta) and Tommy (Joe Pesci) in their twenties, where they are still trying to steal everything they can get their hands on. The two pull of a daring robbery of Air France, scoring almost $ 400,000.<br/><br/>Henry meets and eventually marries Karen (Lorraine Bracco), a no-nonsense Jewish girl. In one of the best sequences of any Scorcese picture, Henry walks with Karen through the kitchen of the famous New York restaurant, the Copacabana (this shot was imitated in ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Swingers."") All is going well until Henry and Jimmy get sent to prison. Henry starts selling cocaine and eventually becomes hooked.<br/><br/>In the most entertaining sequences of the film (title card reads Sunday May 11, 1980), Henry must coordinate several different things in one day -- cooking dinner for his family, delivering silencers to Jimmy, picking up and preparing cocaine for some customers near Atlanta. The entire montage is set to several great classic rock songs, including Harry Nillson's ""Jump Into The Fire"", George Harrison's ""What Is Life"", The Who's ""Magic Bus"" and The Rolling Stones ""Monkey Man."" One of Scorcese's strongest points has always been his musical selections, especially in ""Goodfellas"" This is Scorcese's masterpiece and it should not be missed. A must see for any fan of the cinema. 10 out of 10 stars."
"biminator","9","0","2","10 December 2006"," webifi is a tool...
","This movie was far from perfect. Rather slow-moving, and on occasion, simply boring. However, it was largely enjoyable.<br/><br/>Now, webifi is trying to make this movie into ""Birth of a Nation 2.0"", ranting about its apparent racism. However, this simply isn't the case. The use of the ""n-word"" is merely for illustrating the racism inherent in society at the time the film is set. I personally don't like the word, and I find its use generally unappealing. However, let's not kid ourselves. People back in the Fifties, Sixties, and even Seventies used the word all the time. Just because we find it unpleasant doesn't mean we can ignore it.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I find webifi's hypocrisy disturbing. He/she accuses Caucasians as a whole of racism, which is inherently racist. I'm quite possibly as white as they come (hooray, stereotypes), and I have no ill feelings towards people with a different skin color. Yet webifi clumps ""us"" all together as one group with one set of beliefs. Despicable.<br/><br/>The fact that the main characters meet no black people before going to jail simply illustrates their own racism, rather than any Scorsese harbors. They refuse to associate with African Americans unless they have to, making them racists.<br/><br/>On a more humorous note, ""This little director had a ball""? Come on. It's not Scorsese's fault he's 5' 4''. Leave the poor guy alone. I'm sure he got picked on enough as a child.<br/><br/>Besides, he/she says this phrase twice, and seems to be fascinated by the word ""lovely"". Honestly, if you're going to go on a ridiculous rant like this, get a damn thesaurus.<br/><br/>Lastly, webifi insists on using the expression ""you people"" not once, but twice. Seriously. As if this rant hadn't already been racist enough. I, as a ""goofy white guy"" am practically forbidden from using this term in front of anyone whose hide is a different shade than my own, and yet, webifi, as a ""person of color"", gets to use it all the damn time. I'm all for it, just let everybody say it, because who's to say whether someone's referring to a specific ethnic group, or just a non-specific group of people? Overall, I think webifi needs to examine his/her own racism before coming here and calling ""white people"" a bunch of racists."

","This is an incredible film. It's my favorite film (other than the original Star Wars trilogy), and it's one of the best-made films I've ever seen. That's two separate lists, mind you.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta's performance is mesmerizing from beginning to end. I was compelled to watch the show ""Smith"" this fall because of the idea that Ray would be playing a crook again, and how great would that be? He is great both as a gangster on the top, and a mobster who's taken a fall. And his smile--you don't know whether he's gonna kiss you or kill you. Joe Pesci was perfect as the cowboy who's maverick attitude is his undoing. He's also the focal point of the greatest scene in the movie. He can look on his mantle, knowing that he truly deserved his Oscar. Not every actor can say that (Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump, anyone?). Robert DeNiro does the same job he always does. I swear, he's so great that his performances come to be expected. I think he would have 6 or 7 more Oscars if he wasn't so good in whatever roll he plays. If he'd just ""tank it"" for a movie or two, maybe the Oscar voters would take more notice of the high-caliber roles he consistently puts out there. Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino complete the inner circle in satisfying fashion. It's so sad, the look in Paulie's eyes when he gives Henry the money he has in his pocket, then disowns him forever.<br/><br/>The script is full of repeatable lines, the best known of which have entered the cultural lexicon (""I'm funny how, like a clown, I amuse you?""). Me and my mom still say ""I'm gonna go get the papers get the papers"" all the time. I'm not a film techie, up on all the ways that the crew does their jobs to bring a movie together. I just know that everything in GoodFellas comes together to make a perfect crime drama. I really can't see why Scorsese is Oscar-less when he's making movies like this one. Everyone remotely interested in drama, or crime, or good films needs to see this movie."

","This is Martin Scorsese's greatest movie ever played on screen. Of course it is often compared to Raging Bull which is also another great cinematic masterpiece but no where close to Good Fellas which is the definitive mobster movie of the 90s and all time. Robert DeNiro gives off his greatest performance but we shouldn't put all our eyes on DeNiro as Ray Liotta is the king of this movie showing what its like to become a mobster and go through changes and how you don't just turn to a man but inside you change. It is perfect in story wise. But lets not forget about Pesci where could it be without Pesci the hard headed mobster who never wants to be punked around. All around this was a great achievement and in my books is one of the greatest movies ever told on screen.10 out 10."
"Soysoy","8","0","1","19 November 2006"," Dull mob opera at the root, but rich subtext and a directing tour-de-force
","This is one of the most impressive movies I've seen at the film-making level. I'm extremely interested in the way directors build films as audiovisual evocative worlds with specific rules, more than I am in the actual stories told, so of course I enjoyed this immensely.<br/><br/>I can see the influence this film had on many directors, sadly the style elements that were borrowed from it (mainly the editing/score style) have been very badly executed most of the time. Strangely, I think that only french directors Gaspard Noé (in ""Carne"" and ""Seul contre tous"") and Jean-Pierre Jeunet (in ""Delicatessen"" and ""Amélie"") could pull off effective cinematic works with these editing/score structures. Since then, in mainstream cinema, these elements have mostly degenerated in a derivative mannerism without any power. Sad.<br/><br/>Yeah, I definitely enjoyed the ride, and took good note of many fantastic cinematic devices, some great subtext (food as philosophy, almost as a character)... but still I have complaints.<br/><br/>The first one is De Niro. Sorry but when I see him here, I still see an actor, not a character. I can take this when the movie takes a strong self-referential stance, deliberately using actors as actors, like in ""Jackie Brown"" or ""Brazil"" where De Niro fits perfectly. But here it doesn't work for me, I found it distracting (""hey, look, it's De Niro!"").<br/><br/>The second one is the root substance. These mob operas generally are entertaining, but have a very shallow philosophy, follow very strict narrative conventions and don't have much to offer as culture. I even find them rather questionable as role models for adolescents.<br/><br/>So what we have here is brilliant thanks to the director, and the director only. Even at the acting level: yes they're good, but their acting alone wouldn't have such power showed if Scorcese had not used them as a Chess Master, moving pieces on the board.<br/><br/>Shallow substance, but very intelligent movie-making with power, wit and imagination. Enthralling. So much so that it's only when the movie is over that one (possibly) realizes that something is missing. A tour-de-force."

","In the movie, to me the people who carried Henry's mother's grocery all the way is not out of respect, but fear. In gang movies such as Godfather and Goodfellas, they always messed up the concept of respect and fear. Is that because how the writer wrote the story or the Italian gangsters are too stupid to identify the difference between respect and fear? I hardly believe anybody will really 'respect' gangster. Did anyone envy the life of gangster after they watched the movie? Hopefully somebody can be able to answer my question, and please do not give me dumb answers such as:'That is how the ways are back to the days. People did respect the mobs and that's why they do it. It is difficult to explain such abstract concept. You might know if you become one of their members.'"

"armandmanning","8","0","1","20 April 2006"," Great movie, but one point i'd like people to consider
","I feel about this movie the way I feel about all Scorcese films; my one controversial contention is that they lack heart. They are so well executed, virtuosic, precise, controlled, and at the same time, a little exuberant. Still, they lack heart. Have you ever seen deep parts of yourself in his characters or in his worlds, have you ever recognized, as one might, in the look of a Wes Anderson film, or even in the playful inventiveness of Back to the Future, a world that feels new and familiar at the same time, particular and general, some world or situation or feeling that you feel has been in you forever though you're only recognizing it now. Do you feel deeply about any of them? Simply put, do they move you? Perhaps an answer of 'No' to these questions does not indicate a deficiency. But out of the best works of art I want that phenomenon of meeting myself in something separate from me, a new and yet familiar part of myself, that sense of expansion, that presentiment of a mysterious and universal beauty. Given that, though, I do not hesitate to say that Scorcese's films are compelling, and furthermore, that Goodfellas ranks high among them. I am involved in its story easily and always when I run across it on TV. Just remembering the cocaine helicopter pasta sauce sequence makes me think well of the movie."
"walkinginmysleep2129","10","0","1","17 April 2006"," Godfather vs. Goodfellas
","When speaking of gangster films, the argument will always come down to the relative supremacy of the two best offerings of the genre, Godfather and Goodfellas. The interesting parallel between these two films is realism. After the release of Godfather, writer Mario Puzo was approached by several Mafioso who assumed (incorrectly) that he was involved with the mob due to the level of perceived realism. Meanwhile, one of the biggest complaints against Goodfellas is that the violence is over-the-top and unnecessary. However, unlike Godfather, Goodfellas is based on a true story and the real Henry Hill has stated the film is 99% true. In fact, the real Tommy actually yelled ""Shine these f**king shoes!"" as he stomped Billy Batts. Disturbing scenes like this draw a lot of criticism for the film, however this is all an accurate depiction of mob life, so if you don't like that, then why are you watching mob films?<br/><br/>The story of Henry Hill is a familiar one; a young boy growing up in a tough neighborhood becomes seduced by the flashiness, respect, and perceived success of the mob. What makes Goodfellas a classic, and better than the countless others, is the stylish and effective camera-work of director Martin Scorsese. As we trace Henry's New Jersey childhood, the camera continually centers on a star struck young boy watching his heroes with admiration and wonder. This is continued throughout the film even as Henry moves into adulthood, he still looks up to Paulie like a little kid. Then there is the narration. In lesser films narration would be used to cover plot holes and force the film along. In Goodfellas, the narration is probably unnecessary, as the film would flow fine without it, but Scorsese uses it the way it is supposed to be used, to provide added insight into the characters and why Henry participates in amoral activities with such zeal. It also helps that Ray Liotta's delivery is just about perfect. <br/><br/>The usual theme of gangster movies is otherwise good people getting seduced into a bad lifestyle of doing horrible things for money. The interesting thing about Goodfellas is that under Scorsese's expert direction, we are the ones being seduced. An excellent example of this is the famous Copacabana date scene. In this three-minute long steadicam shot, it is almost as if we were on a date with Henry as we follow he and Karen wind their way through the back door of the famous nightclub, eventually coming out on top, as it were, into a choice spot right in front of the stage. Throughout the film, we are confronted with extremely intimate camera-work that brings us into their inner circle as they lean together conspiratorially to plan their Air France heist and others. <br/><br/>However, no discussion of Goodfellas would be complete without addressing the violence. Yes, it is horrible. Yes, it is graphic. Yes, it is disturbing. One thing it is not, is glorifying. The opening scene foreshadows the brutality of the last half of the film as we see a man, in a trunk, get shot multiple times, then stabbed with a kitchen knife. But once the opening credits rush across the screen, and the narration starts we can push that out of our minds and get lulled into a false sense of security by Henry's adoring praise of the wiseguy father figures who populate his childhood and the darkly humorous way the violence is handled in the first act. This all changes, however in one instant as Henry pistol-whips Karen's neighbor with the wandering hands. We are definitely made to feel as though this attack is justified, but it marks a turning point in the mood of the film. We can draw a line right at this point to divide the movie into two halves. Where as before we see the mob life through rose-colored glasses, we now begin to see the downfall of the characters that before were invincible. From here we see brutality after brutality as their situation gets more desperate and they try harder and harder to keep things together. The difference between the mood of the two halves can also be seen in the first two times Henry finds himself in court. When, as a child, Henry keeps his mouth shut and takes the fall, he is praised and congratulated by Paulie and the others. The event is seen as a rite of passage. The second time, however, no one is laughing, foreshadowing the final scenes of the film.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is everything Godfather is not. Where Godfather focuses on kings of the underworld, Goodfellas shows us the lives of the low level soldiers under them. When Godfather is grandiose and operatic, Goodfellas is gritty and intimate. Even though they actually have similar running times, Godfather comes off as hard to sit through, while Goodfellas is accessible, almost to a fault, as in the nearly heavy-handed technique of freezing the frame to make sure we pay attention to the particularly important moments. By drawing us into the life of one of the most mysterious and fabled aspects of American society, the mob, Martin Scorsese earns his title as the greatest living American director, and Goodfellas earns its place as the best gangster movie ever."

","I've seen many mob movies,until now,this one is the best~I was deeply shocked while watching this movie the first time,and then within 24 hours I just watched it again.To me it's far better than other movies related with Mafia. From the beginning I was attracted by Henry's legendary life...he's really a perfect guy,agile,flexible,ambitious.lovable...except for choosing the run way, in some way he's my idol~ Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci's performed great,too.De Niro still as a cold-blood killer,he seems to be specialized in acting this kind of character..and Pesci still acted as a nut..crazy and dangerous and disgusting nut like he acted in Casino.The camera shots was concise and the rhythm was quickly,it's hard to believe that this movie was casted in 1990, thanks to the director Martin Scorsese.. And after my second watch i got more info,every game has it's rules,and joining Mafia is just like playing a dangerous and exciting game,rules also exist,at the beginning of the movie Herry was told by Jimmy never sold off friends,and always keep mouth shut,later Paul admonished him never touch drugs,Those are the prime rules,but apparently Herry broke them all,he got involved in drug dealing,and caught by cops,then afraid of being killed,he sold up the whole family,It's rather interesting,Herry is a smart guy in the Mafia group,but he was just too smart and ambitious,and finally led to his doom,and destroyed the whole family by keep on breaking rules.Tommy did the same thing,killed Batt without the confirmation from upper class,and got revenge..Jimmy also made stupid mistakes,he tried to set up Herry's wife,but failed,then he ordered Henry to kill someone,he must know that the Herries are very wise people,so it's really hard to believe why he left so many hints for them to fight back,whilst Paul is rather pathetic,he got fooled by Herry for once,and too Mercy to let him go,but he underestimated the effect of this drug cases,that led to his doom. I think the Chinese translation about the film name is very vivid,(Dao Yi you Dao)literally means Even being a thief has it's rules. But some of the plots are really hard to understand,especially the painting drawn by Tommy's mother when Tommy killed Batts,it was rather weird,Tommy killed Batts,then his mother show the painting exactly like Batts,and there's two dogs behind,one head for east,the other head for west,does that implicit anything??"

","It is a true mobster story about three violent ""wise guys"", enhanced by the Italian-American director's own experience of his upbringing in Italy.The young Henry Hill (Christopher Serrone), a teenager in an impoverished Brooklyn neighborhood in the mid-1950s, is attracted to and impressed by the flashy, expensive clothes and cars that would congregate across the street from his family's apartment.Background music has played a great role in the success of this movie . In Goodfellas the director returns to the formula to select pop songs that perfectly evoke the New York mobsters of his youth. It constitutes of a pop oldies soundtrack, beginning with crooner Tony Bennett's ""Rags to Riches,"" proceeding through rock 'n' roll, jukebox music and top 40 tunes etc. The way these score have been added to the movie have given layer of meaning, mood and information to the fact-based tale. over all i should say that this is one the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life good work martin"

","Watching Goodfellas is a rare experience. The characters, their lifestyle and tone of the film suck you in and will not let you go. <br/><br/>Goodfellas contains flawless acting with Ray Liotta who shines as the shy, modest gangster who doesn't really fit in between the ball breaking tough guys. His performance is outrageous yet subtle. Like Joe Carnahan said: Ray Liotta can say more with one look in his eyes than other actors can with a 5 minute monologue. Joe Pesci is hilarious and very disturbing as the aggressive Tommy DeVito. He is like a ticking timebom without display; you can't predict when he's going to explode. Robert DeNiro is scary but likable as Jimmy Conway and the other actors like Paul Sorvino are excellent and really contribute to the overall feel of the film.<br/><br/>Goodfellas truly delivers on every aspect of film-making; acting, soundtrack (with ''Layla'' and ''Sunshine of your love'' being the most memorable) editing (The chaos that Henry goes through on his last day as a wiseguy is one of the best edited scenes ever)<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

But it's true, I found out some interesting stuff on the net. -You know you're in for a semi-violent movie when the opening shows a man being stabbed and shot in the boot of the car and the narrator saying ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"" -Fortunately some of the violence is portrayed pretty light-heartedly, such as the postman being beat up and told not to deliver any more letters from the school to a kid who does errands for the mob. -This movie features all the guys you'd expect to see in a mafia movie. I'd bet most of those guys have never played anything other than ""mafia guys"". At least there's a fair bit of work going for them, although it has died off since ""Donnie Brasco"". -Not one of his best roles, but another great mafia movie for Robert DeNiro. Seems his mafia movie roles got more and more pleasant, ending up in that guy in ""Analyse This"", which I deny was ever made. -Funniest scene of the movie: when Henry walks out of the court as a kid. -2nd funniest scene: When the guys are on their way to bury a body and drop by Tommy's mum house to get some tools and end us sitting down for a big pasta meal. -Look for the very small cameo by Samuel L Jackson. man he had some short, rubbish roles before cracking it big time."

","Goodfellas, along with Pulp Fiction, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and Se7en, is one of the very best of the movies that the 1990's had to offer. In my review for Casino, I said that I believed that Casino was slightly better than Goodfellas. I think that Casino is underrated, because Goodfellas is all the rage and Casino seemed to get sloppy seconds because both of these films are so similar in style, context, and nature. Casino just seemed like it flowed better than Goodfellas, but, as I said before, just slightly. For me, it's like comparing The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2. It's just so close that the winner of the race is hard to call. However, Goodfellas is an amazing piece of cinema that should have been awarded the best picture Oscar. It was daring and new, and it does deserve its place in the top 50 movies of all time on this site. Martin Scorsese is a master director who is a force to be reckoned with. Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci light up the screen, too. Roger Ebert said that he felt that Goodfellas was better than The Godfather. I do not agree with that statement, because I do not feel that it is better than The Godfather or The Godfather Part 2. These films are just so amazing. Goodfellas deserves its place as one of the greatest American films. I just think that Casino deserves some time in the spotlight, as well."
"Hancock_the_Superb","8","0","1","5 September 2005"," Very Good, But Not A Masterpiece
","""Goodfellas"" is a solid, well-made and well-put together film that deserves the accolades it gets. However, I don't think it's quite in the same league as ""The Godfather"" or ""Once Upon A Time In America"". It's more in the realm of ""The Untouchables"", in that it's made more for a mainstream audience than the above films.<br/><br/>The movie, to put it succinctly, regards Henry Hill (Ray Liotta in a wonderfully underrated performance), an Irish/Italian kid who grows up in New York wanting to be a gangster. He becomes a relatively big shot apprentice of local boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino), though his sympathies lie with infamous gangster Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and his explosive long-time partner, Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Eventually, after much violence, many affairs, a downward spiral caused mostly by drug abuse, and a robbery gone bad, Hill is arrested by the police and basically forced into violating one of the mob's key codes: don't rat on a friend, and always keep your mouth shut.<br/><br/>The film's storyline is flawlessly done, with no real plot holes that can be noticed. The photography is gorgeous throughout. And the acting is some of the best you're likely to see anywhere. Liotta tackles the role of Henry Hill with great panache, and depicts his rise and fall very well (even his narration is great to listen to most of the time). Lorraine Bracco gives arguably her best performance as Henry's slightly unhinged and paranoid wife, Karen. Robert De Niro gives his usual excellent performance, underplaying his part as Jimmy except when a little force is needed. Paul Sorvino is calm and likable as the big boss Paulie. But needless to say, Joe Pesci as the explosive, extraordinarily profane (2/3's of the films ""fucks"" must come from him), and extremely violent Tommy steals the show. Pesci is one of the finest actors ever, and he really owns this movie from beginning to end - and his death, needless to say, is something of a shock. Various other great actors like Frank Vincent, Vince Pastore, Michael Imperioli, and Samuel L. Jackson, among others, have small, early career parts.<br/><br/>But there's just something about this movie which doesn't strike me as being as good as the above films. I can't put my finger on it how. I think, like ""The Untouchables"", it was made with being a popular film in mind, rather than a great one. That's not to detract from the film too much, but it's just an observation. The period soundtrack (made up almost entirely of songs from the '40s-'70s) works sometimes, but other times (particularly the ""Beyond the Sea"" during the prison scenes) it detracts from the action and took me at least out of the film. Obviously, most others will disagree with my points.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Goodfellas"" is a solid, entertaining, and very well-made film that I'd recommend to pretty much anyone. Is it a great movie? I think so. Is it a classic? Arguably. Is it one of the top two or three mob movies ever? Not quite. Still, an 8/10 (which is what I'm giving this film) is still a very good score. Nothing to be ashamed about in that, Martin."

","As far back as he could remember Henry Hill wanted to be a gangster. He got his wish and in GoodFellas we get to go along for the exciting ride. Before the opening titles have even concluded we get a clear sense of the very dangerous yet oddly thrilling lives Henry and his fellow gangsters lead. And the sense of excitement and wonder is maintained right up until the bitter end.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta is the nominal lead in his role as Henry from whose point of view the story is told. While Liotta is fine in his role Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito and Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway are even better. The boundless energy and manic temper Pesci brings to Tommy are absolutely perfect. Pesci's performance in the now-famous ""I'm funny how?"" scene is acting at its best. De Niro's performance is more subtle but also brilliant and his portrayal of Jimmy brings a sense of menace whenever he appears. Even though he is for the most part restrained, you know he is fully capable of exploding at any moment. Also giving fine performances are Lorraine Bracco as Henry's wife, Karen, and Paul Sorvino as the quiet, mysterious, yet undeniably powerful mob boss Paul Cicero.<br/><br/>GoodFellas depicts the rise and fall of Henry Hill in his life in the mafia. We follow him from his beginnings as a simple Brooklyn youth through dizzying highs and maddening lows. Henry is in effect telling his own story here through Liotta's voice-over narration and this device works well, filling in some blanks, helping to move the story along and also giving some insight into the motivations which drive his actions. We also get some insight from Karen's point of view as sporadic Bracco narration sheds some light on how a simple, naive girl gets swept up in the mob life.<br/><br/>The unique Martin Scorsese touch also adds a great deal to the experience. So many sequences are brilliantly conceived and perfectly executed. None is more memorable than the truly brilliant tracking shot where for over three unbroken minutes we follow Henry and Karen from the street outside the Copacabana nightclub down through the bowels of the club and right up to the front of the stage. Few directors would even imagine such a sequence much less be able to pull it off so wonderfully. Scorsese's use of music is also pitch-perfect as he seems to always be able to find just the right song to perfectly frame each moment. And as would be expected with Scorsese nothing is spared in terms of violence or language. Henry Hill and those around him led ruthless, violent, dangerous lives and Scorsese captures that wonderfully. Proceeding at its own pace, GoodFellas allows you to really get to know and appreciate these characters. Some might quibble and say things move along too slowly, that the pace could be picked up. But there is no denying that, overall, GoodFellas is absolutely terrific."

","There are two halves to this movie. The first half is the opening of the world to Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), the world is his oyster. The second half is the claustrophobic closing in on his world by everyone. It is how director Martin Scorcese is able to get the audience to feel these emotions where the genius of Goodfellas comes from. The visual cues given to the audience further the story along as much as the dialog does. Who's-who of Italian actors all star in this story about the mob in New York before Henry Hill enters the ""Witness Protecion Program."" Based on the book by Hill, it details his entire life, from a young boy wanting to be part of the mob, to his 20s when he's part of the clan, getting into the back doors of his favorite clubs, making money off airline heists. It then shows his downfall, drugs begin to take over his and his wife's life (played by Lorraine Bracco of Dr. Melfi fame), leading up to the defining moment of the movie when the Hills are shadowed as they move about town by an ominous looking helicopter all day. The feeling of the walls closing in is choking as Hill knows it's checkmate and he has to go over to the other side. The movie also stars Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, who like Hill is not Italian so can never become a ""made man"" but still runs the mob while most of the higher-ups are in jail, Joe Pesci, who won an Oscar for his role, as the hotheaded Tommy DeVito, and various other well known Italian actors. Considered one of the finest movies involving the mob not named The Godfather, Goodfellas shows both how wonderful it can be to be in the mob, but also the costs, the emotional strains on the families, and the ultimate price paid. To this day, Henry Hill is still in ""The Program,"" while most of the characters chronicled in the film are either dead or just getting out of jail. A great visual look at both the good and bad of the mob, and all that goes with it."

","Martin Scorcese's compelling 'Goodfellas' is arguably his most entertaining film.  It's accomplishments include a strong but believable narrative, a loving recreation of two decades of New York life in music and images (including some famously stunning elongated tracking shots), and great performances, in particular from Joe Peschi as the psychopathic killer Tommy and Paul Sorvino as a mafia boss.  Yet its watchability is also its weakness.  Central character Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) narrates throughout, smoothing together the strands of the story but also telling us how to interpret it and thus distancing us from the action.  The film lacks the visceral intimacy of 'Raging Bull' (or, indeed, the subversiveness of 'Taxi Driver' or 'The King of Comedy'), while, for example, the emotional impact of the scenes where Henry realises the mob is out to kill him is slight compared with, say, the similar scenes concerning Al Pacino's character in 'Donnie Brasco'. It's almost impossible to dislike this film, because we are led through it so adeptly, but at a certain level, it's little more than a well-spun yarn, proof perhaps that a master reaches the height of his technical powers somewhat later than the peak of his imagination.  Enjoy it, but the early stuff is better."

Ray Liotta is off the chart as Henry Hill, Pesci is extremely disturbing as Tommy, DeNiro is insanely good as Jimmy, Paul Sorvino was never better and Lorraine Bracco's turn as Karen sends the whole project into overdrive. The small things, like Tommy's mother's paintings and the crew's discussion of the boat painting bring a demented light to the movie which frankly has not been attained in any other movie. Improves with frequent viewing."

"JohnBoyRoy","8","0","1","19 May 2004"," A modern popularist classic
","First and foremost, much as many so-called film conosieurs would like to think, Martin Scorsese is not an underground name anymore - and Goodfellas marked his departure from exclusive to mainstream alternative.<br/><br/>Try to forget the urban chique that now surrounds Goodfellas and watch with a mind to experience the visceral nature of this brilliant film.  Don't think of it on terms of whats 'cool' or what 'happens'; but why and how these events are occuring.<br/><br/>Just try to experience Goodfellas from the perpective it was intended -of Henry Hill, not of a comfortable arm chair perspective where what is, in fact sickening violence and abuse, can appear as glorified and entertaining. Imagine it was you who were at risk and apply this to Scorsese's in-your-face-approach.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci is amazing in this film, and once again DeNiro commands each and every moment he does not share with Pesci, with total charisma and power.<br/><br/>The benchmark to which many Scorsese and other gangster films will be measured, for years to come, and a certified part of popular culture.<br/><br/>Stunning."

I'm a fan of gangster movies, and ironically Casino is one of my favourite films, but I really thought this was trash.<br/><br/>It has one simple problem: the main characters, with the possible exception of De Niro's, just aren't intimidating. Joe Pesci's in particular is a squeaky-voiced midget, and all are hopelessly incompetent morons. Are we really supposed to believe that these idiots, alternately irritating and clueless, work their way up through ranks of brutal, remorseless killers and thieves? Pah.<br/><br/>I give the actors credit for trying hard, but they're wrestling with two-dimensional scenarios and a one-dimensional script throughout. In one memorable scene, three foot tall, mickey-mouse voiced ""unpedictable maniac"" Tommy De Vito (Pesci) rants, ""But, I'm funny how? Funny like a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh? I'm here to fuckin' amuse you?"". Luckily, Henry Hill, the pimply faced runty butt of his joke is the sort of ""hardened gangster"" who throws up at the sight of a dead body, and so Tommy doesn't get the punch in the face he so richly deserves.

"Aragorn___","10","0","1","30 June 2002"," Among Scorsese's best and a true classic
","Goodfellas is without a doubt one of the best gangster films of all time, if not THE best.  I find it hard to watch a gangster movie without likening and comparing it to Goodfellas in more than one fashion; ranging from script, musical score, acting and screenplay - and most of the time I have to admit, none of them come near to Goodfellas.<br/><br/>You couldn't have picked a better director than Scorsese to do this film and his exquisite and rightly respected directing skills are on full show as he transforms this age-old clichÃ© genre into a real classic film where the audience is captivated from start to finish.  The acting is superb and Liotta as Henry Hill puts in possibly his lifetime best performance and with Joe Pesci as his side-kick you've got an extremely talented actor who never fails to either make you laugh (whut, am I a clown?) or make you despise him (the first scene) at the click of a finger; magic - in a word.  To be honest, there are talented actors left, right and center in Goodfellas.<br/><br/>The script itself is masterful in picking up the story halfway through the movie before jetting back to the ""proper"" starting point of a film to show you what's happened up to the point where the film picks up.  It's sort of hard to follow and pleasantly surprising when you see it first time but becomes crystal clear towards the end and when you watch it again it all makes full and complete sense.<br/><br/>My only quam with Goodfellas is that in places it is often drawn out and the film itself is very long, however, don't let this deduct from the film's brilliance as is seen from The Godfather movies.  Goodfellas is a beautifully directed and acted masterpiece and as with all gangster movies, the language and extremely explicit and gory violence comes at a thick and fast pace.  However, the fact that Goodfellas is high up in the top 250 movies is testament to this film's true brilliance.<br/><br/>Certainly one for the collection and certainly one worth respect. 10/10"

","There is NO WAY IN HELL ""Dances With Wolves"" was better than this MASTERPIECE!!! There is no one on planet Earth who can tell a story on film better than Martin Scorsese, and ""Goodfellas"" is no deviation from that truth. It's brilliance, just brilliance. <br/><br/>It is the single dirtiest, grimiest movie I've ever seen, and I LOVE IT!! The Mafia are not people you want to mess with. You could be friends with guys for years and years, but if they get the slightest inkling that you're going to rat them out, it's a wrap for you. Oh, Morrie, he should have stopped busting balls! After the heist, one guy buys a freakin' caddy and another guy buys a fur coat. My favorite scene in the movie is when Henry Hill(Ray Liotta) is on the phone with Lois, telling her to use an outside line to make the call. ""Un-bleeping-believable, all of them! Every woman in my life!!"" ""Keep stirring the sauce!!!"" ""It's my favorite hat and I won't go without it!!"" There is also maybe no scene grimier than when Tommy(Joe Pesci) gets whacked. De Niro's scene upon learning of the whacking is testimony to why he is regarded by many as the greatest film actor of all time. The thing that I love about De Niro is that his emotions are authentic. You feel everything that he's feeling. Like in ""Raging Bull"" when he is making up with his brother near the end, and he's hugging him, kissing him, truly remorseful for what he did to him. ""Goodfellas"" is FULL of memorable scenes. ""You broke your cherry!!!"" Lorraine Bracco is not only beautiful, but one hell of an actress, and deserved maybe the Oscar and not just the nomination. The scene where De Niro is about to send Bracco to get whacked is scary. De Niro looks like a dirty old man who is sending someone to get porn magazines for him at the nearby store. Great freakin' actor. Also notice Scorsese's food motif. The table, decorated with rich, hearty meals when Henry was in his prime, and towards the end, the table filled with junk food, soda, etc. Scorsese is a master, if not the master of his craft. Pesci is simultaneously hilarious and terrifying in the performance that won him the best supporting actor Oscar. Just a great story, all around. Paul Sorvino is great as Paulie. The most touching scene in the movie is when Paulie gives Henry the money and tells him that he has to turn his back on him. Liotta's face, pretty much says it all. Morrie has to stop busting balls!! This movie made me want to be a gangster of course until the end, the Mafia is not a group one wants to mess with. I cannot say for sure if this is better than ""The Godfather"", because I LOVE that movie, I'll just leave them tied. 1990's best picture and maybe the best picture of the 1990's. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Scorsese, De Niro, and Pesci for LIFE!!!!"

Some may prefer the visceral emotions of RAGING BULL or the trance state of TAXI DRIVER, but this is the one where Scorsese took his place as the uncontested champion of American filmmakers. Scorsese uses his virtuosity playfully, gigglingly, like Mozart or Michael Jordan; you can practically hear him cackling, ""Can you believe what I can do?"" He doesn't use his talents to bully the audience into admiration, as Spielberg sometimes does; it's like he's telling a fabulous joke he's cracking up over almost too much to complete. Of all American movies of recent decades, this is the one that stales the least with repeat viewings; you could watch it a hundred times and still feel the shiver of delight it produced on a first viewing. The perfectness of it in all regards produces a strange thrill in the audience when seeing it projected--you feel the crowd wanting to stand up and dance.

","I realize it is unfair to narrow down the ""Greatest film ever"" category. However, ""Goodfellas"" is movie perfection. Every minute of Martin Scorsese's masterpiece is skillfully directed. Film student's should be required to watch this film at least twice. (The first time to get the story, the second time to catch all the little things). Scorsese is the only director that I can think of that can actually film a metaphore. Example: when Karen Hill is given a gun to hide, where does she hide it? In a milk holder. What color is milk? White. For those of us who read and analyzed ""Catcher in the Rye"" we know that white represents innocence. And  a bloodied gun into a milk holder represents her tainted innocence. That was one example of a metaphore caught on film. This film is also jam packed with what is called dark comedy. Why are Henry Hill and Jimmy Conway worried about getting blood on their shoes than the person they just killed? Another thing to watch out for are the camera angles. Perfect. (I recommend the use of the handheld camera when Henry and Karen are on their second date. Can you believe that was all in one shot?). all of this while developing great realistic characters whose humor is so subtle you may even question if it is really funny.  Most of us movie lovers have seen ""Goodfellas"", but I ask all who is reading this review one question: Have you really SEEN ""Goodfellas""? **** out of ****"

So the other day me and 3 of my friends just sat down and discussed the best in all the genres. First we started in fantasy and the winner hands down was Lord of the Rings and then we went to gangster genre, Godfather was the obvious choice and then my friend said Goodfellas . I had heard of the movie but never got down to see it, so I went and rented the movie. The next thing I know, I have gone to a music store and bought the VCD. In case you don't get my drift, this movie is AWESOME!<br/><br/>Goodfellas is a movie directed by Martin Scorsese who has another classic, `Raging Bull' starring Robert De Niro under his belt. The movie's main cast consists of Ray Liotta playing the role of Henry, De Niro playing the role of James Conway better known as Jimmy and Joe Pesci playing the role of Tommy. The movie has many other memorable characters but they are too many to mention here.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie itself is awesome. You have Jimmy, Tommy and Henry going in a car and they hear voices from the trunk. They get out and open the trunk and see that the guy they just `whacked' is still alive. Tommy takes a knife and stabs him continuously and Jimmy shoots the entire magazine into him. Jimmy is witnessing all this and says 'As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster.' Superlative stuff! Then begins the movie.<br/><br/>Flashback to the time when Henry was a kid. He is fascinated by the way the gangsters live their life and he manages to get a job at the place where the gangsters used to hang around and soon he rises up the ladder and becomes a partner of Jimmy and Tommy. He is also trusted a lot by Polly who is the head honcho of the `Gangster Family'. We are shown glimpses of the extravagant life that these guys live. Tipping 100 dollars, carrying wads of cash, huge apartments, fast cars, guns, the works. Then during one of the `jobs' Henry messes with the wrong guy and finds himself in the prison with many other of his friends including Polly. That's when he gets into the wrong business Â– the drugs and narcotics business. Then begins a sequence of events which destroy the gangsters and his life. I will stop there as revealing the plot will not make you watch the movie which I definitely want you too!<br/><br/>Ray Liotta has given a performance which he will never better in his life. He has given a very powerful performance and probably he is the only guy in the film you might feel sorry for. The way he laughs in the movie also adds to his performance. The laugh is so `gangster like'. The other thing that struck me about his performance is his transformation after getting into the narcotics business. It's so real. You have to see it to know it.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci won the Oscar for this movie for the best supporting actor. Another performance which will not be surpassed by him. He is the foul mouthed and short tempered gangster. He was by far my favorite and most interesting character in the movie. The scene where he tells Henry `But, I'm funny how? Funny like a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh? I'm here to fuc*in' amuse you?' was a really superb scene and Pesci was wonderful in that. Needless to say, Pesci's character shoots lots of bullet and uses a lot of `F' words.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro? What do you want me to say ? It is Robert De Niro! Wonderful as always. De Nero's character is opposite to that of Pesci's character. He is the calm, calculative man. He kills almost all his `friends' when he makes big heist and wants to cut off all the `links' pointing towards him. The scenes where he interacts with Henry are probably his best scenes.<br/><br/>There are some scenes in this movie which will remain in my memory for ever. The Foul mouthed Tommy goes to the honchos house thinking that he is going to be made( Sort of a promotion) and when he goes into a room and realizes that he is going to be killed, all he says is , `Oh, No' !. Then there is the other scene where Henry goes and beats up the guy who teases his girlfriend! Then there is the other scene where you are shown how Jimmy got rid of his friends who were linked with his big robbery. They first show 2 bodies in the garbage processing machine, then the dead bodies in the car, the dead body in the meat van. Oh, this movie is such a master piece.<br/><br/>I don't usually do this in my movie reviews, but this movie has so many cool and good dialogues. I would like to share a couple with you. Henry - You know, we always called each other Goodfellas. Like, you'd say to somebody: 'You're gonna like this guy; he's all right. He's a goodfella. He's one of us.' You understand? We were Goodfellas, wiseguys.' Tommy - He said, 'No, you're gonna tell me something today, tough guy.' I said, 'All right, I'll tell you something: go fuc* your mother!' There are too many of such lines too tell. If you want more, check out the quotes section. Move over Godfather, there's new number one in loverboy's list."

","Yah, I agree this was a well made movie, and has unique and great acting.... except I can't stand it, because in the end Henry Hill is nothing but a good-for-nothing Cocaine Addict who becomes a rat.<br/><br/>I'd take ""A Bronx Tale"", or ""Casino"" over this one any day."

","""Goodfellas"" has a good story, and there are some really great camera shots and edits that are characteristic of Mr. Scorsese.  However, I didn't like it as well as, say, ""Raging Bull"".  For one thing, I thought that some of the violence was a little bit unnecessary.  Now I know that the main characters are not heroes, but are anti-heroes.  But I still think that there were some parts that were unnecessary - in particular, the part where Tommy mercilessly shoots the poor kid in the bar. However, in addition to the artistic shots and editing, the film also had some really memorable dialogue.  And there was some great acting, especially from DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta.  So, I wouldn't say that this film is a perfect 10, but I guess I'll give it a 7.5.  Although a little violent, it is a film I wouldn't mind seeing again."

","What can you say about Goodfellas that has not already been said? It is difficult to review a film that nearly everybody has seen and nearly everybody loves. Goodfellas is without doubt the best gangster film ever made and in my opinion in the top three films of all time. Ray Liota,Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are all fantastic but for me the latter steals the show. Joe Pesci is the most frightening gangster ever seen for me and the scene where he winds Liota up with his ""how am i funny"" in the resterant is scary! Scorsese directs this film like no other. You can watch this film over and over again and see something new everytime (and i have). I think what also makes Googfellas so viewer friendly is the narration by Liota throughout the movie.You are never left in doubt as to what is going on.I must have seen Goodfellas a dozen times now and i'm sure there will be many more times i watch it. For fans of the Soprannos look out for how many people are in this and the HBO gangster show. I counted at least 5. 10 out of 10."
"Sfpsycho415","10","0","1","29 July 2003"," One of the best films ever----10/10
","I once read a story about Martin Scorsese's battle with cocaine addiction and how Robert De Niro saved his life one way or another by visiting him in the hospital and convincing him to get back to work and make Raging Bull. I started to think that if it wasn't for that, we may never have seen Goodfellas. So if the above is true, thank you Bobby and Marty for making it possible.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is one of the very best movies i have ever seen. It's story, it's dialouge, it's visual style, and it's characters force us to sit up and pay attention to the story of a guy who as far back as he could remember always wanted to be a gangster. In what should have been an Oscar-winning performance (more on that later), Ray Liotta delivers as Henry Hill, a half-Irish half-Italian New Yorker who joins the local mob and is introduced to a life most people never have the chance to live. He meets a pretty but fiery woman named Karen (Lorraine Bracco), makes best friends Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci), and becomes a mob saint when he helps pull off a multi-million dollar heist. Slowly but surely, however, the good life turns sour as he cheats on his wife, the heist eventually costs him everything he has and some very dear friends, and he is forced to testify against the people who gave him so much and enter witness protection.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese moves the story along with quick pace, by using hilarious, violent, and emotional scenes alternately. We see Hill's life deteriorate by keeping the glamour and the women at the beginning and the addictions and paranoia towards the end. It is an absolute shame that this film didn't win Best Director (which Scorsese should have one countless times by now), let alone Best Picture, Actor, Supporting Actress, and Adapted Screenplay. This is the reason i don't care for the Oscars anymore. One thing the Academy did do right is give Joe Pesci the Best Supporting Actor award. Never has a character been so funny and so terrifying all in the same film. Pesci was another reason the 2 and a half hour film goes by in a snap.<br/><br/>Goodfellas, in my opinion, is even better than the Godfather. While the Godfather may have Marlon Brando's brilliant performance and more visually pleasing locations, Goodfellas is a true gangster picture based on reality and more adaptable to modern times. It is not only a classic, it is a masterpiece. 10/10"
"Raskolnikov","Null","0","1","17 January 1999"," Good, but not the best.
","Mob films are a popular genre, and a lot of very gifted filmmakers have turned their talents to them.  Scorsese's best attempt so far has indeed been 'Goodfellas'.  It is a very well filmed, very well acted and very entertaining crime movie.  It's the sort of movie that film students like. However I feel what it lacks is a heart.  'Goodfellas' just isn't moving or emotional enough.  I don't believe it's the best, or even _one_ of the best crime movies of recent times.<br/><br/>If you want an elaborate tale of several decades in the life of the mafia then watch the 'Godfather' movies.  If you want a realistic look into life for the average 'wiseguy' then watch 'Donnie Brasco'.  If you want a hip crime flic with great dialogue, then watch 'Pulp Fiction'.  Goodfellas is simply outclassed by these three films.<br/><br/>8/10 - An imperfect but honorable addition to the genre."

","Though the cinematography and performances were excellent, the film suffered from a musical score that was disjointed, out of place and distraction from the quality of the film.  The cinematography in this film was so amazing that it made want to cry, this film had some amazing shots, which alone make this film something everyone who has a love of film should see.  However, the music in the film is a collection of great classic rock songs, which alone are great songs, but are too loud and seem to be disjointed from the scenes which is very distracting.  It might be worth it to watch this film with no volume."
"mm-39","9","0","1","11 January 2001"," What can I say
","This movie is alot like the movie Mean streats, but with a higher budget. I read the book ""Wise guy"" and the movie follow the book well.  When I read a book I have piture go threw my head of what I am reading, and this moive did this with out myself having to read the book again. Beliveable, and directed in the manner of the author telling the story.  The art of story tell is a lost one with many the entertainment industry marketing for a public with  a short attenion span, but in the world of Jerry Springer, and professional wrestling, where the product is directed at a 2 second attention span this moive cuts down the quick fix mentaliy of our time. This is a well crafted film, which has a story told and unravels in proper fourm.  This is a nice break from factory made fourmulated moives where you can guess the script 10 minitues into the movie.  Like the music industry where all the county music and dance music sounds the same, alot of movie go this route,this movie stands out from the repetition."
"rich-228","8","0","1","10 January 2001"," Undeniably great
","This film is undoubtedly the best gangster movie I've seen.  All the principals - Scorcese as director, De Niro, Liotta, Pesci are at their best here.  The movie is also unfortunately full of 4 letter words and unbelievably violent scenes, but that's part of the reality of the Mafia underworld the film portrays.  Full of fine little touches - my favorites are the characters Frankie Two Times and Johnny Roast Beef."
"theshuttlewoods","9","0","1","26 December 2000"," Scorsese's finest hour
","Goodfellas is one of the few films that is just made for narration. Liotta's commentary makes the film exciting, moving and is told well. The film is made from a contrast from 'The Godfather', where the leadership of the mafia is examined. In 'Goodfellas' we see the world through a hood at the bottom of the ladder, and how he relates to life in general over 20 years. Liotta is excellent, as is De Niro, but for me the standout performance was from Joe Pesci, who is just scary as the pscychopathic 'Tommy'. This film deserves a top 20 place on imdb.9/10"
"edwin-33","10","0","2","17 December 2000"," Without a doubt, one of the best...
","There's nothing I could say that completely show how much I love this movie. The acting is absolutely perfect, the message is subtle but powerful, and, most importantly, it's a fun ride the entire time. Like the gangsters in this film, you may too feel guilty for enjoying the dark life. The oldies soundtrack is, and this is severely understating, fantastic. Everything has basically formed together in an almost perfect culmination that equals undeniably ""the best mob movie ever"", as is often quoted. The 'real' best picture of 1990."

","Scorcese's film is a true classic. It's blend of superb acting and directorial flair manages to make the story highly realistic. In the beginning we like Henry are seduced by the gangster but by the end of the movie our opinion on gangster life changes dramatically. A gritty hard hitting movie that eclipses all others."
"coverme6","Null","0","1","5 August 2000"," Watch this excellent mob thriller... or be whacked!!
","Martin Scorsese delivers the ultimate gangster flick, and his argueably finest movie ever. Complete with an ensemble cast consisting of Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Lorraine Bracco, the actors leave no stone unturned as they play their parts with a lot of heart and soul, as if it would be the big- gest roles of their lives. ""Goodfellas"" is a film about the 30-year exploits of a young New York kid named Henry (Liotta), who becomes infatuated with mob life when he is ""adopted"" by a mafia family. Soon, Henry and his two best buds Jimmy (DeNiro in his most sadistic role ever!) and Tommy (Pesci, whose delightfully evil here), paint the town red and cause chaos towards rival hoods. Henry later marries a local girl named Karen (Bracco), who seems like putty in Henry's hands, but becomes shocked when she discovers her husband's true colors with the mafia. With tension filled scenes and a gripping script which is narr- ated by the 3 leads, (a concept used in another brilliant Scor- sese flick ""Casino"") the viewer will feel every bit of the heat that is simmered by the cast and atmosphere. Plus, a lively soundtrack consisting of rock music and old Italian love songs make the movie more enjoyable to the viewer. The only flaws that might make the viewer cringe are the slightly grim vio- lence (check out the beginning of the movie. Whew!), and the total running time of the movie, which runs at least more than an hour and a half. But other than that, ""Goodfellas"" is a prime crime thriller, not to be missed!"

","where do i start, scorsese was in a bit of a dark period at the time after the undeserved failures of raging bull, king of comedy, after hours and the last temptation of christ, adapting from the true story of henry hill with the co writer of the book, nicholas phleggi. scorsese fashioned something incredibly brilliant out of it, with stunning, almost claustrophobic photography by michael ballhus, perfect paced editing from michael powell's widow ( he died the same year the film came out) thelma schoonmaker and an truly exhilarating mix of pithy, sharp, realistic dialogue, careful, amazingly spot on pacing and of course perhaps the finest example of direction ever to appear on screen all combine with jaw dropping peformances (especially from pesci who's "" you think i'm funny speech "" has to the most menacing speech of all time )to be the finest film ever made."

The acting (i'd name a couple of good performances but they're all just terrific). The score is also terrific. It's the story of Henry Miller's rise and fall in the mob-world. The story effortlessly unfolds into a shocking, sometimes even hilariously funny but always compelling epic. It's a portrait of the crime-world in suburbia during the 50s 60s and 70s and it is so plausible it came as no surprise to me to learn it was based on a true story."

Then there's Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Robert Deniro who all turn in great performances. This film is a masterpiece. Much, Much better than ""The Godfather""."
