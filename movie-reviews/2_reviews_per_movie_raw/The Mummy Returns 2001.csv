"MR_Heraclius","8","39","42","20 February 2020"," Loved this sequel! Amazing work by everybody
","The Mummy Returns is a film that, I think, you need to see the first film of the saga because otherwise you don't understand some little details. That film is a film like Indiana Jones with the same plot and the same characters. But the kid is an exception. The cinema show us the kids like boys and girls insufferable, but Alex O'Conell is a boy that ""pass more time in the museum that in house"". One difference this film have respect Indiana Jone's films are the sobrenatural characters than appears like The Scorpión King or Imhotep. If you like Indiana Jones and Egyptian mithology, I recomend you that film"

","The success of ""The Mummy"" in 1999 surprised everyone, and on the day that it opened, Universal Studios greenlit another sequel. The original (the 1999 one) was a lot of fun because it mixed creepy scares with awesome action and goofy humor. The sequel does more or less the same thing, except that the action sequences come pretty much one after another from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Rick (Brendan Fraser) has married his love from the first film, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), and the have a son, Alex (Freddy Boath). After finding the bracelet of the mythical Scorpion King, they're attacked by villains who are intent on raising Imhotep from the dead (again) so he can kill the Scorpion King and take over the world. Of course, it's up to Rick and Evelyn to stop them.<br/><br/>All the characters from the first film in the franchise are back, and they slide into their parts easily. Arnold Vosloo gets to do more with his character, and Patricia Velasquez (who has about 10 times as much screen time as she did in the first film) has a lot of fun acting like Jennifer Lopez's alter-ego. There are a few new characters as well, including young Freddie Boath, who is excellent as Alex. His screen appeal rivals Macauley Culkin at his best. Shaun Parkes is a much better source of comic relief than Kevin J. O'Connor (he's consistently funny, and the dialogue between him and Rick or Jonathan is hilarious). Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is suitably creepy as a new villain and Alun Armstrong is suitably kooky as the ringleader.<br/><br/>Stephen Sommers knows how to create an action movie. He creates real characters, not actors who are given different names, and sends them into action scene after action scene. It's a fun and exciting flick, and that's all it tries to be."
"mentalcritic","Null","74","88","21 May 2001"," Better than some would make out...
","When The Mummy hit theatres in 1999, critics everywhere panned it as being a poor man's Indiana Jones. While the two movies are about as similar as Dr. No is to GoldenEye (thankfully), I suppose comparisons between one non-stop adventure film and other are inevitable. In the end, what really counts when determining a film's quality is the level to which it can entertain. And if there is one thing The Mummy did well, it was entertain. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo were very well chosen for their roles.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns is easy to see as being another sequel churned out to satiate the greedy money-machine that Hollywood has become, but it has a few things working for it. One thing that is immediately obvious is that the sequel was very much intended to be a film that could be enjoyed without ever having seen the original. The only references to the previous film are done to fill in the narrative gaps about who Imhotep is, and why he is the way he is. The addition of The Scorpion King was an interesting effort to give the film a new antagonist, but the lack of screentime didn't work well in this tangent's favour. Another tangent that could have been better developed was the rivalry between Imhotep's girlfriend and whatever her name was. Imhotep originally mistook Rachel Weisz's character for being his girlfriend reincarnated, so the use of a woman who looks exactly like her while creating this new tangent needed to be developed differently.<br/><br/>Most people won't give a damn about complex story tangents and will want to know if this film is entertaining. And it is entertaining, alright. There is barely a dull moment in the film's substantial running length, and Oded Fehr does a bang-up job of providing a Mad-Max-cum-Indiana-Jones hero. I want to know where they get those groovy costumes and tattoos from, they look quite nice. Anyway, when all is said and done, this is an eight out of ten film. A few badly constructed story details here and there, but some extremely entertaining action sequences make up for them. Don't listen to the nay-sayers. This is matinee-style material at its (almost) best. Get the DVD when it comes out, it will at least tide you over until George Lucas gets his head out of his proverbial and realises that the VHS era is well and truly over."
"daria84","8","41","48","7 May 2003"," Pretty good for a sequel.
","This movie is pretty good, it delivers pretty much the same thing we got in the Firs movie.  Some characters are more developed and some others more expanded, all the same, some others are reduced and we are introduced to new characters.  The plot is good, not as good as the first movie, but still does a good job keeping you interested and entertained the whole time. <br/><br/>
The sequel takes place 10 years later, when Rick O'Conell (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) are now married, and have a son, Alex (Freddie Boath).  Alex has been kidnaped by the bad guys, including the infamous Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) and his eternal love reincarnated (Patricia Velazques).  Now it's just a matter of time for them to find Alex before it's too late for everybody...<br/><br/>The performances are pretty good, almost all of them.  Brendan Fraser does a good job once again as the handsome Rick, he is strong, funny, charismatic, what else can you ask?  Rachel Weisz role has been developed a lot more, she is no longer the clumsy egyptologist wanna-be, now she runs the British museum and is a mom; and she does a great job with that.  John Hannah is also back as  the useless Jonathan, this time not as funny as he used to be. Oded Fehr  character has been expanded a lot, we get to see him a lot more in this movie.  He did a good job as Ardeth.  One more time, the winner of this movie is Arnold Vosloo as the villain; his performance was excellent! He manages to express all the emotions without opening his mouth!  This guy has great acting skills, too bad not many movie producers/directors have noticed it.  The Rock does his movie debut with this movie, he is the Scorpion King, the whole movie turns around him, even though he was in the movie for the first 5 minutes of it.  Still he did a good job for his first time.  Patricia Velazques was the only one who did a BAAAAD job.  Her acting is awful! She is pretty and everything, but she really needs some acting classes.<br/><br/>The music once again is one of the key parts of this movie, it is really good, even though Jerry Goldsmith wasn't in charge of it. The direction is good too, just like in the first movie, and we get to see a lot more of special effects.<br/><br/>This movie is good, i really enjoyed it, I liked the first one better though, but that's just me.  You might like this one better, so YOU MUST SEE THIS ONE! **** out of *****"

","Rick and Evelyn now married with a son, find themselves amidst the second coming of Imhotep. After their Son Alex is kidnapped by Imhotep as he seeks the Scorpion King (The Rock) Rick and Evelyn must pursue their sons capture, with the aid of the clues Alex leaves along the way.<br/><br/>Aside from some unusual revelations in Evelyn and Ricks past, the movie concentrates mainly on the action this time out and runs a little short on story.<br/><br/>I Liked the evolution of Evey's character, now she's hardened up she makes a mean adversary, and takes part in some good battles.<br/><br/>All in all, i enjoyed the experience and once again the Visuals were more than adequate.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first, then watch this one, its good fun and has some fine moments.<br/><br/>7/10"
"CuriosityKilledShawn","7","22","27","24 October 2004"," A fast-paced, inventive adventure
","Mummy Returns takes the characters and story from the first film and develops on them in a big, big way. The situations and set-pieces are wilder, the odds even bigger and character arcs more complex.<br/><br/>Set 10 years after the first movie Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have made a rich living out of plundering tombs and pyramids. Who could have predicted that their old nemesis I'm-Ho-Tep would return faster and stronger than before.<br/><br/>But I'm still having trouble seeing I'm-Ho-Tep as a villain. Surely it's the scheming, lying, conspiring supplicants that are the real villains. The look in his eyes at the end, when his lover betrays him, is heartbreaking. I can't root for him as a bad guy when he never really does anything bad. Sure he wants to rule the world and all but who doesn't?<br/><br/>The effects are not the best (Star Wars Episode 2 used up all the space at ILM at the time) but there are loads of them and they're all lavish and imaginative. I HATE movies that are carried by SFX but Mummy Returns incorporates them into the story in a seamless way. How cool is the big balloon? Or the approach of Anubis' army?<br/><br/>Most directors screw-up big budget, big scale movies (AVP, King Arthur, Sky Captain, Exorcist Prequel, Catwoman) but Stephen Sommers knows where the heart of this kind of movie is and delivers, once again, a cheeky adventure with loads and loads of action and enough story and character to back it up. Filmed in Panavision the 2.35:1 anamorphic picture is perfect and the Dolby/DTS 5.1 is very loud and thundering. A very good soundtrack indeed. The extras are total fluff and not worth the time."
"jhclues","7","32","41","8 May 2001"," A Special Effects Extravaganza
","If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you're probably expecting fast paced adventure, non-stop action and a special effects extravaganza with just enough story to keep it all interesting.  And if that's what you're hoping for, you certainly won't be disappointed; because that's exactly what you get in `The Mummy Returns,' written and directed by Stephen Sommers. The story begins in Egypt, where Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his wife, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) discover an ancient bracelet that had once belonged to a warrior known as `The Scorpion King (The Rock),' who, back in the day, had sold his soul to the god, Anubis, for control of his armies and domination of the world.  Now, it seems, The Scorpion King's resurrection is imminent, and if he succeeds and once again raises the armies of Anubis, he could very well take over or destroy the world.  Followers of Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo), however, who are privy to this information as well, decide to resurrect their dark leader so that he can face The Scorpion King, defeat him, take control of Anubis' armies and conquer the world himself, putting them in control.  But the key to the whole plan lies with who has control of the bracelet at the time of The Scorpion King's resurrection.  And the O'Connells have taken it back home with them to London. <br/><br/>
	So the adventure begins in earnest, moving from Egypt to London, then back again to Egypt.  Along the way, there's plenty of mummies, fighting, and bugs, but very few surprises, except for one scene near the end when something quite unexpected happens.  The story itself gets somewhat lost in the muddle, but it doesn't really matter; plot is fairly insignificant in a movie like this, as long as it maintains at least a thread of credibility and can give the action some context.  And that it does, so all is well and it allows you to get on with what this movie is really all about, which-- simply put-- is having a good time.<br/><br/>	With shades of `Indiana Jones' and `Star Wars' abounding, the real success of this movie lies in the fact that it never pretends to be anything other than what it is or what it was meant to be, and that is an entertaining, fun movie.  It's visually explosive, from the sweeping, desert vistas of the converging, battling armies, to the mummies and assorted demons and creatures generously sprinkled throughout.  And the hand-to-hand combat scenes between Evelyn and Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez) are especially thrilling.  The one element of the film that doesn't seem to work too well has to do with a particular mode of transportation to which the O'Connells must resort upon their return to Egypt, and which ultimately plays a significant part in the outcome of the whole adventure.  It's something that seemingly would have been more appropriate in `The Adventures of Baron Munchausen' or `Peter Pan.'<br/><br/>	As far as the performances, suffice to say that the actors involved all do their jobs well; after all, in a movie like this you're not going to find anyone struggling with `The Method.'  Fraser strikes a handsome, heroic pose-- call him a poor man's Indiana Jones-- and Weisz is becoming as Evelyn.  Most importantly, they all walk the walk and talk the talk, and Sommers keeps them on track and wisely avoids allowing any lapses into `camp' or tongue-in-cheek character interpretations, which makes this a solid, fun-filled, action-adventure movie that is what it is.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes John Hannah (providing some comic relief as Jonathan Carnahan), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lock Nah), Freddie Boath (Alex O'Connell) and Obed Fehr (Ardeth Bay).  As with most sequels, you'll get more out of `The Mummy Returns' if you've seen the original, which had more of a story and, of course, would give you the background of the characters. But even on it's own and taken at face value, this movie is a feast for the senses, and just a lot of good fun.  Just don't go in expecting anything more than what the trailer promises; if you can do that, chances are you're going to enjoy the movie and have a good time.  I rate this one 7/10."
"rye9969","Null","70","96","2 June 2003"," Simply Awesome!
","On my day off from work today, I decided to pop in the Mummy Returns for something fun to watch. I hadn't seen it since it was released for homeviewing, so it's been about a year or two. I must say that this movie takes my breath away each time I see it. The Mummy Returns is a roller coaster ride which barely stops during the entire 2+ hours! I love the CGI effects, and how lavish the scenery looks. The movie made me feel as though I was witnessing Ancient Egypt and and the 1930's era in person. So what if things look 'cartoony' during the battling sequences! I think that the battle sequences in Two Towers looked just as much the same. I find that with many fans nowadays, they take things way too seriously. If a movie or TV series is not what they hope for, then they blast it all to hell just because they are whining babies. Take for instance Star Trek Nemesis. That was another really good movie, yet the so called 'fans' ripped it apart piece by piece and then fed it to the dogs. I just wish that the babies would enjoy the movies instead of complaining that a movie isn't good quality. If thats the case they should just go back to their rooms and watch Fargo or the English Patient! Both the Mummy and the Mummy Returns rock as far as action movies go. Get a huge bag of chips a large bottle of pop, sit down with your girlfriend and enjoy two great movies!! Excellent fun!!"
"halebopp3","10","66","91","2 December 2001"," Romance makes movie complete
","After seeing ""The Mummy"" in the theaters for the first time two years ago, I knew I would be hooked. I've watched it about twenty times since then, and as many people know, this movie does not get boring or less funny after watching it numerous times, in fact, I think it gets more and more thrilling each time. I began hoping for a sequel to be released, and when I heard that one was in the making, I was relieved that they weren't going to end this great storyline with just one film. When ""The Mummy Returns"" was finally released in theaters, it didn't recieve very many good reviews right away. I was dissapointed because I didn't understand how Stephen Sommers could direct such a great movie classic and then totally botch a promising sequel. I let the reviews get to me and I didn't see the movie while in the theaters. I waited until this past weekend to watch TMR on pay-per-view not expecting much due to the bad reviews, but I soon found out that, boy, were some of those critics wrong.<br/><br/>Right from the opening scene I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed. The action, special effects, acting, comedy, and romance were all better than it's prequel in my opinion. The plot was a little confusing, and the Scorpion King graphic at the end looked like the same one used in the video game, but all in all it was an extremely fun and enjoyable movie. I actually found myself watching it three times in a row. I probably could have watched it 24 hours straight, but I didn't want to ruin it right away.<br/><br/>The SFX in TMR were outstanding. The pymies were so amazing, and the Anubis warriors were excellent as well. But, on to the greater aspects of the film. I thought that Jonathan, played by John Hannah, is one of the funniest characters ever, his one-liners are terrific, I was laughing out loud during his lines. Arnold Vosloo is great as the title character, but could have been more like the original, he was not as powerful in this film but was good anyway. Many people disliked Alex O'Connell, played by newcomer Freddie Boath, but I found him to be quite funny and likable. He had many great lines and was sarcastic when the film needed it. He is a cute kid and l hope he will have a good acting career. Oded Fehr is wonderful as Ardeth Bay. He keeps the heroes grounded.<br/><br/>Meela/Anck-su-namun, played by Patricia Velasquez has some good scenes, but I found her to be not as great as the rest of the cast. I wasn't really looking forward to seeing The Rock as the Scorpion  King in this film, but he wasn't as bad as I thought, even though he was only it for about three minutes, I would have labled him as an extra. It was all hype for him. My favorite part of ""The Mummy Returns"" was the great chemistry between Brendan Fraser (Rick) and Rachel Weisz (Evie). They looked like an actual couple in this film, unlike other recent movies. This was why I liked this one better than the prequel. A little bit of romance was what was missing from the first 2/3 of ""The Mummy"", and I am so glad it was included much more in this film. Brendan Fraser is very easy on the eyes and he looks like a down-to-earth guy, not like a stereotypical moviestar. I think this is why the two seem so believeable in TMR, they are just two normal people who are still very beautiful people. I am glad they made Evie more attractive in TMR, she deserves to show off her pretty eyes. Rick is great because he is still the same sarcastic, wise-guy, handsome hero, who has all the females in the theater (including myself) drooling and sighing, that he was in the first mummy movie.<br/><br/>I hope that they will make another sequel with Fraser, Weisz, Hannah, Vosloo, Fehr, and Boath all included. They can't take out any of these characters without the movie being butchered. I probably won't see ""The Scorpion King"" since Brendan and Rachel, my favorite characters, won't be in it. I know there are many others just like me who love the romance in this film. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes action, SFX, comedy, romance, and good clean fun. I would give this movie a 9.9 out of 10 points with the 0.1 being subtracted because it wasn't long enough to really explain the plot in more depth. When it ended, I wished it wasn't over. This goes in my top 5 movies of all time."
"philip_vanderveken","7","62","86","31 October 2004"," Enjoyable thanks to the humor and the many special effects.
","Most people compare this sequel to the first movie 'The Mummy', which is a good thing of course, but I haven't seen the first one, so no comparisons from me. <br/><br/>So what can I tell you? Well, the movie isn't as bad as I expected. It's all to clear that the director's first thought wasn't about the script but about the many special effects, but i still quite liked the movie. What made this movie work for me was the humor. Normally this kind of movies takes itself much too serious, there is no place for any joke or funny situation at all. In The Mummy Returns this is different. <br/><br/>Thanks to the humor, this movie was very enjoyable, but it is of course the many special effects that make this movie what it is. Don't expect anything real: a mummy coming to life, sucking the life out of people, armies of mythological creatures... will of course never exist in reality, but it certainly was nice to see. <br/><br/>I guess it is best to qualify this movie as some excellent way to pass some boring hours on a cold and rainy afternoon. It's certainly not an intellectual movie, but I didn't mind about that when watching it. I give it a 6,5/10."
"zetes","7","60","88","4 May 2001"," Unpretentious and fun. 7/10
","The Mummy Returns is maybe a step above the first one. The action is non-stop, and it does manage, for the most part, to rouse the audience, or at least me. The good guys are likable. Brendan Fraser is where he belongs. Rachel Weisz is beautiful. John Hannah amuses as Jonathan, and Freddie Boath manages not to annoy as Alex, the kid. He's pretty good as a smart-mouthed brat. The bad guys are, for the most part, fun to hate. Im-Ho-Tep is a good villain. Maybe he isn't given enough to do here, but he's still cool. Patricia Valazquez is a real stunner as his love interst, Anck-Su-Namun. She's probably the best thing about the film. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was good as Lock Nah, the main henchman. Perhaps the weakest part of the film is the Rock as the Scorpion King. The narration during the film's prologue is not nearly as good as it would be if we were watching the story develop. The Scorpion King is basically a boring character. His computer-animated doppleganger at the film's climax is neat, but it would have been better if there were some feelings towards that character.<br/><br/>People who know their action flicks will notice that the Mummy Returns steals about every action scene from every action movie made in the past 20 years, quoting movies like Aliens, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park 2 (why? that movie was terrible), and especially Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, with which, if you remember, The Mummy I was competing with in the box office successfully in May of 1999. They don't try to hide any of it. They even make a jest at Spielberg with a shadow against the moon from ET and Amblin Entertainment. It's all in good fun. You shouldn't be too angry at the sloppy script. If you are going to be angry, the shoddy computer animation should be your target. Still, it's not bad."
"Universalmike15","10","7","8","19 July 2012"," One of the best sequels ever
","I remember the day when i saw The Mummy (1999) and thought to myself, ""this is a damn good movie! I'd love to see the sequel!"" And, sure enough, the sequel was released just two days later. The opening of the film had already utilized many special effects including the Tower at Thebes and the two armies fighting till the death. Also, The Rock (even though his only line was in Ancient Egyptian) was still pretty solid. After an intense war scene, we finally arrive on the O'connells. Rick (Brendan Fraser) is now a family man. his son, Alex, shows as much strength and warmth that both Evy and Rick have. Throughout the film, the relationship within the family grew and amassed to that of an odd family. The film doesn't slow down yet, we are then treated to beautiful sets that have you believe they actually were in Egypt all those years ago. Also, Alan Silvestri has a truly magnificent score that is used to its fullest potential. The film takes us to Hamunaptra, where Imhotep is found inside of some cocoon like object. later, we are at the museum in a truly memorable fight sequence. There are also some nice scenes to look at, interesting dialogue. And, some AMAZING special effects.<br/><br/>Overall Consensus: The Mummy Returns is, without a doubt, the best Sequel ever made. It's fun, engaging, Beautifully shot/acted and will make the audience feel as if sand is between their toes, wanting to see more of the action."

","I remember seeing this movie as a kid near this titles release date. Back then I didn't know too much, but I knew this movie was great! To this day I still watch it frequently and enjoy it. The chemistry between Frasier and Rachel is near perfect. The action is fun and the comedy is funny. As a lover of anything Egyptian I get my fill in this movie. Action, romance, Egyptian stuff, repeat. You have to take the movie for what it is and just enjoy it. Starting from the begging the story and action are gripping. The way the movie even pokes fun at itself is brilliant. When Rachel is explaining to Frasier about the Bracelet of Anubis and the Scorpion King, Frasier finishes her sentences by saying ""Let me guess, he wants to wipe out the world"" ""How do you know?"" she asks. Well because that is all bad guys intentions. The movie knows its stereotypical plot and embraces it with humor. Grab your Ankh, put up your Anubis statue, and enjoy this flick time after time!"

Very creepy but not to creepy loads of action but not overdone loads of love and drama but not outspoken and clever laughs and visuals and if I was to be asked for a flaw to mention on this or the first movie my response is simple there is none get your friends family snacks soda sit down and enjoy that simple."

"hitchcockthelegend","7","10","14","14 August 2013"," Yeah, right, and no harm ever came from reading a book. You remember how that one went?
","After the financial success of ""The Mummy"" two years earlier, the sequel was inevitable. The big players from the first film are back, Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo and Oded Fehr. Stephen Sommers once again directs (and writes), Patricia Velasquez comes in to be a main player after her cameo in the first film, and young Freddie Boath plays the son of Rick and Evelyn who are now married. This time the cameo goes to Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson who plays The Scorpion King and who is replaced by a very bad CGI version of himself at film's finale.<br/><br/>When the second sequel, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" (2008), was released, Brendan Fraser went on record as saying that for ""The Mummy Returns"" they basically remade the film they had already made in 1999! This is absolutely true, some new characters and an expansion on the O'Connell romance have been put in to beef it up, while some Zombie Pygmies are around to add extra monster factor, but yes! It's a re-tread only with more money spent, more effects (and better effects apart from Scorpion King) and more noise. This actually is OK for those who enjoyed the first film immensely, because ""Returns"" is every bit as enjoyable as family blockbuster entertainment. The Worldwide box offices rang to the tune of over $330 million in profit. That's a lot of happy families you would think!.<br/><br/>So yes, it's a bit of a cheat, but much like the film before it, it gets away with it because the makers do everything they can to entertain the action/adventure loving crowd. With legions of Anubis warriors, those awesome Pygmies and the all round funny by-play between a cast comfortable with the material (again), ""The Mummy Returns"" delivers exactly what can reasonably be expected of it. 7/10"

","The Mummy Returns, which was released in 2001, is a sequel to the 1999 hit, The Mummy. This movie is a very worthy and fun to watch sequel. The actors all hold their own in throughout the film and do a wonderful job at portraying their roles. Brendan Frasier does a great job in the action sequences along side Rachel Weisz. The new characters are very well put together as well. I really enjoyed the villains in this movie, especially the scorpion King, played by the very well cast Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. He truly is perfect for the role of the scorpion King, tough, muscular, good looking, and able to do the hardcore action adventure scenes true justice. On to The special effects. The special effects are very well done in this flick, very cool and realistic looking, well for the most part that is, there is one scene at the end where the special effects are actually pretty bad looking. The end part where the scorpion King is resurrected, the cgi in that scene is very poor, but that's the only bad part with the special effects, the rest are great! This movies plot summary was also very pleasing and satisfying, the plot was original and creative. 8/10 for the mummy returns."

Hey come on it was fun.

","The plot of this film is too complex to set out in any great detail. Suffice it to say that a group of villains, including one of the curators of the British Museum, have revived the corpse of the Ancient Egyptian priest Imhotep, who was put to death for his part in the murder of the Pharaoh, a crime carried out by his wife Anck-su-Namun, who was also Imhotep's lover. The villains are also seeking to use a magic bracelet to revive the Scorpion King (a warrior from another period of Egyptian history who sold his soul to the dark god Anubis in exchange for military success) and his army. The idea is that they will then use Imhotep to kill the Scorpion King, which will give them control of his army, which they will then use to achieve their ambition of world domination. The only people who can thwart their schemes are Rick O'Connell, an American archaeologist, and his beautiful English wife Evelyn, whose young son Alex has stolen the magic bracelet. Evelyn just happens to be the reincarnation of the daughter of the murdered Pharaoh.<br/><br/>You get the general idea. Don't you just love social realism?<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the plot of 'The Mummy Returns' is clearly nonsensical, I rather enjoyed the film. It is set in the 1930s, and it clearly owes much to the 'Indiana Jones' films, also set in that period. Both involve Egyptian archaeology and artefacts with mystical powers. Although this will sound heretical to the army of Spielberg devotees, who have voted 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' to number 17 in your list of the 250 best movies of all time, I have to say that I enjoyed 'The Mummy Returns' at least as much as any of the 'Indiana Jones' series (and considerably more than 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'). The reason is that the film is fast-paced and occasionally witty; the film whisks the viewer from one adventure to another and generates enough excitement to make him or her forget the many absurdities and inconsistencies in the script. The film never makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously, a mistake that can often ruin an adventure film of this nature. <br/><br/>The best thing about this film is that it stars the gorgeous Rachel Weisz. Indeed, it helped to change my ideas about her. I had previously seen Rachel as an attractive, but rather conservative and proper actress, always playing English rose types in art-house movies. 'The Mummy Returns' (I have never seen 'The Mummy') showed that she has a larger range than this and has not only the looks, but also the sex appeal and cinematic presence, to take the lead in Hollywood blockbusters. (Her predecessor as official English Rose, Helena Bonham Carter, has also made a similar move). Brendan Fraser has never really been my favourite actor, but here he did well as Rick, the solid and dependable family man. <br/><br/>This is very much a 'family values' thriller, like 'True Lies' or 'The River Wild', in which mum, dad and the kid all play their part in thwarting the bad guys. This phenomenon perhaps marks a change in the way in which women are seen by the film industry. At one time, leading actresses often disliked being cast as a mother, even of young children, as it was seen as a sign that their career as a leading lady was over and that henceforward they only had 'character' roles to look forward to. Rachel Weisz, however, plays a mother both here and in her next film, 'About a Boy', without her career suffering any harm. <br/><br/>Of the other characters, there was an amusing cameo from John Hannah as Jonathan, Evelyn's cowardly and avaricious brother. The villains do not really stand out , with the exception of Patricia Velasquez as the reincarnated Anck-su-Namun, a villainess almost as sexy as the heroine. (Her duel with Rachel Weisz will probably strike most male viewers as the film's most memorable scene). The sense of menace overhanging the heroes comes more from the film's computer-generated effects. One thing I did not like was the Scorpion King, in the early scenes a human being but in the later ones a rather ridiculous and unconvincing half-man half-scorpion monster like something from a cheap B-movie. <br/><br/>In a way, the film could be seen as a modern-day B-movie; an updated large-scale big-budget version of those old Saturday morning quickies. Much the same thing, however, could be said of many of Spielberg's films (and not just Indiana Jones). 'The Mummy Returns' may be nonsense, but at least it is entertaining nonsense. 6/10"

","Not only does the Mummy return but his friends and enemies and all the romance and adventure they brought with them in the first film. Stephen Sommers, Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weisz, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah were back to do the second part of the franchise, this time up against an even more powerful adversary. Parts of the plot are amusingly retrodden from the first part too; and again not much makes or is expected to make sense.<br/><br/>The former servant of Anubis the Scorpion King and his vast army have lain dormant for nearly five thousand years biding their time. Young Imhotep would like to control this power, meanwhile the Fraser's are chasing after them all to get back their precocious eight year old son who has been kidnapped by Imhotep, and to fight Evil with Good too of course. It's a swift film with no messing about but favourite bits out of many include the London Bus ride, the boy's journey on the train, the barmy dirigible flight, the race to get to the pyramid before dawn. With this movie it's only the ride that matters - all the way from 3067 BC to AD 1933, not the reason for it. The cgi cartoonery was laid on with a trowel but usually complemented the action even if a bit brutal at times. Fraser and Weisz certainly had a delightful rapport.<br/><br/>It only worked because it was the same team on and off the screen - take one part of the jigsaw away and you don't have a jigsaw, witness the later disastrous part three. However I still wish it originally could've been a three-film franchise instead of two, simply because we would've had even more of this pleasantly nonsensical hokum to enjoy all these years later!"
"Maciste_Brother","3","2","2","20 April 2004"," Stephen Sommers, undisputed king of schlock!
","THE MUMMY RETURNS is an orgy of actions, noise and cheap special effects that amount to nothing. Stephen Sommers is THE undisputed king of schlock filmmaking. Unlike movies of the past, when schlocky genre films had small budgets to keep them from going over-the-top with their combination of bad taste, unoriginality and complete lack of understanding of what consists of good writing and acting, Stephen Sommers, thanks to uber desperate Universal pictures, works with unlimited amounts of money to bring his super schlocky vision to the big screen. There's nothing restrained or subtle about his style of filmmaking. If Sommers can have 10,000 extras, why not make it 1,000,000 instead, thanks to (overused) CGI. ""More, more, more"" is probably Sommers' motto. The end result is a huge pile of melted processed cheese that has very little to do with Egypt,  mummies or anything else for that matter.<br/><br/>The funniest scene in this action/horror/fantasy/romance/special effects (you can add more slashes to it if you want to) orgy is when the four mummies go through the wall of the museum in London. These mummies are so strong that they can actually go through super thick brick walls of a Victorian building and yet the director has Brendan Fraser destroy them with a shotgun. I'm sure that if Brendan would point his shotgun at the brick walls of the museum, that there'd be very little damage to the walls. The whole scene is totally illogical and always makes me laugh out loud. Ah, that kooky Stephen Sommers.<br/><br/>If you're in the mood for schlock, THE MUMMY RETURNS (or any other Sommers movies) will satisfy you and then some. But if you're looking for any quality filmmaking, well, you'll be sorely disappointed by it."

The special effects are of a lower quality than the original (especially a particularly dodgy  animated monster right at the end). But, overall its a movie released to capitalise on the success of the original. It has no redeeming qualities in the plot / storyline areas and I wished I had waited for it to arrive on broadcast TV. Enough said..."
"Ashekenaz","10","2","2","2 June 2001"," No Plot, Just A Wild, Wild Ride
","****Spoilers Contained Herein****<br/><br/>First off, here's the disclaimer. This movie has no plot whatsoever,nought, nowt, not a lot. Zilch, thats the Big O. If you like your movies to hang together and have deep, complex and meaningfulplots, and don't like it any other way, then you may as well go and get out a video, because you will utterly loathe the Mummy Returns.<br/><br/>If however, you enjoy a good, fun film, to be watched with brain switched off, bucket of popcorn, and several mates, and you like a good laugh, then this is for you.<br/><br/>This is a Wild, Wild ride. This is Indiana Jones written large, with more humour and a few twists. This is the 1930's equivalent of Steampunk, with the rocket-airship and all the gun-play, as well as all the magic and mayhem that goes on. It's a fascinating kind of style really,and one which I'd like to see movies use in the future (albeit maybe with more plot :@) ).<br/><br/>So, right from the first scenes, where they find the bracelet, you realise this sequel is going to at once pay homage to its predecessor, and send you out on some new thrills along the way. You know how it works. Find artefact, make bad quote, accidently unleash ancient evil, race against time to fix it. The Kid is funny, he just has this habit of being incredibly sarcastic at the most inappropriate moments, which is hilarious when you see the reactions he gets. Brendan has made this style his own, and he does the hero schtick very well, fighting, shooting, quipping and complaining his way through the film. Rachel gets to kick ass some more in this film. Lara Croft has nothing on this girl, lets be honest (its the tight black that does it for me). John Hannah plays Jonathan with that usual bumbling Englishness that he did so well in the first film. Arnold Vosloo is as scary as all hell as Imhotep, although I would have liked to have seen some of his other powers. The other players turn in excellent and amusing performances too. The Rock even gets to do his famous eyebrow!<br/><br/>The whole film is just one huge, fun, wild romp through fantasyland from beginning to end. I even liked the music, and the Live song at the end of the credits (Forever may not be long enough) was a good counterpoint to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this. I think you will too."

","The Mummy Returns is a good sequel to The Mummy.  Although The Mummy was remake of an earlier film and the sequel also takes from a few other movies, this one is good.

However, if you are looking for some action packed, good entertainment, this one is for you.<br/><br/>All of the original actors, Brenden Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, return for this sequel.  This helps the movie flow.  The action starts right from the beginning and does not stop until the end. There is little or no ""slow"" period in this one.  The special affects are good for the most part but it appeared the f/x artists were either, running out of money or time in a few areas.  Some of the effects seemed either poor or incomplete.  There were also a few other items in the movie that did not make sense.  There were also problems with some of the technology used in this movie that were not invented by the time this film was suppose to take place (such as a reliable rocket engine in 1933).  <br/><br/>Over all, this one if definitely worth your while (8 out of 10)."

This time around, there's evil followers of Imhotep, armies of the undead, pygmies and The Scorpion King himself.  The pace never lets up. It's a roller coaster ride that takes you up, down and then spins you upside down and throws you for another roll.  The stunts are great, the effects are great, and the story is also great.  This is a perfect summer movie to go watch with your friends.   So, go get your tickets, grab a soda and sit back and let the fun begin."

","What a joke this movie is. The first Mummy was quite alright, with the right dose of suspense, an interesting story, likeable characters and quite subtle visual effects. Not an 'Indiana Jones' in any way, but an enjoyable movie nevertheless.<br/><br/>'The Mummy Returns' looks fake from start to finish. Sommers tried to create a sequel that is bigger an better than the first one, but he failed in almost every way.<br/><br/>Someone should tell film makers that today's computer technology is not yet able to replace EVERY movie set and definitely it's not ready to replace actors!!<br/><br/>This movie includes some of the worst effects ever created by ILM and maybe it's not even their fault. Because it's their job to do what the director wants, so if they were asked to create the Rock as a CGI character, they just had to do it.<br/><br/>Of course the result is totally laughable, an embarrassing moment for a movie with such a high budget. Also the moment where the pyramid sucks in all the jungle, is the stupidest, most fake, over-the-top effect I have ever encountered.<br/><br/>What the hell was Sommers thinking? ""Ah, that's a nice idea, I'll just ask the ILM guys to do it and we're done"". Well, it looks totally cartoonish and ridiculous.<br/><br/>Having recently watched the good old 'Big Trouble in little China', all I have to say is that the rubber monster in no way worst than any of the effects in 'Mummy Returns'. Why? Because principal photography is at least applied on set and can -with the right director- produce a quite realistic result.<br/><br/>Listening to the DVD audio commentary by Stephen Sommers, all I can say is that the guy is totally untalented and has no appreciation of art at all. He was just lucky. The people are always hungry for Indiana Jones type of adventures and he was there at the right time. He is under the impression that because his movie sold well, he created something good.<br/><br/>Well, this movie has zero suspense, the characters are now unlikeable (except for the always brilliant John Hannah) and everything's totally predictable. Plus, there are so many elements in 'Mummy Returns', you just can't keep track of. Pygmy mummies out of nowhere, flying zeppelin things, projector bracelets, weird reincarnations, among others. It's like having a sandwich with everything on; in the end, you just don't know what you're eating.<br/><br/>The script isn't totally bad, but it's loaded with so much useless information that makes the movie hard to watch, even for the sake of the story. I had to listen to the DVD commentary, to realize that the building Eve and Rick return to, is their home and not a museum! What was that?! Who produced this joke of a movie?<br/><br/>The humor is good though, I grant Sommers that. Also did you know that the 2-disk set DVD sold ever more that the movie itself? And it's a terrible release too. The second disc was totally unnecessary, it's full of the Rock being interviewed - who cares about him anyway?<br/><br/>If they followed a more subtle direction, they could have a good movie. You know, Sommers said that computer guys cannot replace an actor. Well, THEY HAVE REPLACED YOU, Stevie!"
"Theo Robertson","5","14","28","15 May 2003"," A Film Shouldn`t Revolve Around CGI
","The problem I had with the original film was that the script seemed to be written around the special effects , especially the CGI . Well the bad news about the sequel is that it suffers from the same problem multiplied by ten. Witness the opening prologue of massed armies fighting , an oasis appearing from nowhere and the scorpian king`s army overrunning a city all of which might have looked good on paper but on screen is badly executed due to some really apalling CGI . I don`t know what it is about this type of cinema technology but think of all the films where it`s been used in set pieces that fail to convince ( ESCAPE FROM LA , DIE ANOTHER DAY etc ) and watching it used in THE MUMMY RETURNS  left me shaking my head wondering why directors and FX maestros haven`t been able to improve upon it . Watching the action scenes in this movie is like watching a cartoon.<br/><br/>Equally unconvincing and uninvolving is the screenplay which revolves around the bad guys wanting to get their hands on Rachel Weisz chest . Who can blame them ? you ask , well it`s not that sort of chest I`m talking about , it`s a treasure chest containing something or another which I didn`t bother to digest because the plot takes second place to a bunch of CGI inspired set pieces . Unfortunately most of the set pieces are stolen from the previous film which gave me a feeling THE MUMMY REMADE WITH A SEQUENCE STOLEN FROM JURASSIC PARK:THE LOST WORLD would have been a better title . And watch out for the number of scenes where one of the good guys is in serious trouble only to have the hero appear to save the day . It really does get tedious after the first three or four times it happens<br/><br/>I may be accused of taking this film far too seriously and not realising it`s a dumb popcorn movie . Perhaps but what`s wrong with an intelligent popcorn movie ? And does anyone else miss the good old days when monsters were men dressed up in costumes or stop frame photography ?"

It was the same movie as its prequel, only worse.  And besides this, whatever storyline that could be made out could be predicted so far ahead of time that it was ridiculous.

"eowr","1","6","10","18 June 2001"," If I could UN-see it I would
","Rarely do I stumble upon movies that make me feel insulted merely to have seen them. The mummy returns could have been a great movie. The story behind it is decent, the special effects - I must give them that - were awesome. But when it comes to the script and the casting there's a few people in Hollywood that should be arrested. The movie is a perfect example of how a movie that could have been good turns bad through the greed of the movie companies. Children never had a place in movies. Very few have managed to incorporate children into the story line, but not one managed to let a child play a major part without the story be made to suffer. We saw it in Star Wars Episode 1, Jurassic Park and now in the mummy returns. In all these movies the story was made to suffer to make the movie more attractive for children, thus producing more money in ticket and merchandise sales. Now it would be one thing if in fact the movie was targeted for the younger audience (like Jurassic Park). Then I would have nothing bad to say about it. I'm 22 years of age, way too old to watch children's movies. But the movie isn't. With the amount of violence actually there, there's no way it could get around an age 13-rating. And I'll tell you what else, there's a ton of movies targeted for children out there that grownups CAN enjoy! I'm not going to go further into why the child part annoys me so much, I am sure you are all intelligent beings who know exactly what I'm talking about. The child actor in the movie is not the only part that destroyed the movie as a whole. The general theme of the lead actors being literally invulnerable (read: immortal) insults my intelligence as an audience member to the greatest. I'm not normally one that spots movie goofs, but in this one there were a hundred and more. You want to see what a good action movie with this theme should be like, rent Indiana Jones. Don't waste a dime on this movie that the movie companies should pay US for to see."

","Unrealistic effects, cliche plot elements, and irritating camera work makes ""The Mummy Returns"" unwatchable. This film tries to incorporate a rediculous storyline with music videoesqe camera work and horrible acting.<br/><br/>
I see that this has gotten a pretty good rating on the database which is beyond me. After being forced to see this movie I realized that Brendon Frasier is a horrible actor and that Big Budget movies has reached the low point. I was neither entertained or surprised at anything that happened in this movie. Also, the story incorporating a little kid which is irritating to say the least. Also, the war against the superimposed sand soldiers was hilarious to watch. Its just great to watch extras try to act afraid to nothing, it doesnt work and is just stupid to watch. I wish we could go back to the days of puppets, then at least the actors could see that they're getting attacked.<br/><br/>The thing that bothered me the most though was the stereotypical music score and cinematography. The music seemed as though it was from the outtakes of the Titanic soundtrack and didn't fit the movie in the slightest. What did match the movie though was the cinematography, that being true because it was bad like the movie. I felt as though I was watching ""Get Carter"" with the sped up frame rate and fast cuts. This became very annoying to me and confirmed the fact that this movie sucked.<br/><br/>Yes this movie has made a buttload of cash, but it doesnt mean that it is good. ""The Mummy Returns"" is a movie that I wished I had never seen and I feel that I should recieve a refund. $7.00 for the movie ticket and $2.00 for the barf bag and aspirin I needed after watching this horrible, horrible movie.

Now look up bad in every english thesaurus ever made, and all the words there won't begin to describe how bad this movie was.<br/><br/>I LIKED the first Mummy.  I give it a ten.  While there might have been a couple tiny bits that left a bad taste in my mouth, overall I thought it was great.  Stephen Sommers is an awesome writer/director, I've always enjoyed his films.  But this...<br/><br/>When I saw the previews,  my mouth watered, it looked awesome.  Sure it had a kid in it, but I didn't think he'd weigh the film down.  They had all the original cast coming back, John Hannah, Oded Fehr... slam dunk, hole in one. But this...<br/><br/>They took the first movie, then instead of taking all the good stuff, they just condensed the Bad Taste In My Mouth parts.  I'm amazed the Kid wasn't the worst thing about it.  Oh, he was Bad, but there's a lot of bad in this movie.  Historical innaccuracies, zero characterization, cliche's galore...any one of those I could have forgiven, but not all of them.<br/><br/>This is a big, soulless, hollywood, summer movie.  This is Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  I hated Short Round...and I hated this Kid.  For the most part, it's a total rehash of stuff from the first movie.  I'd put in a SPOILER warning, but if you saw the first one, you know how this is gonna turn out.  Bad.  It's bad.<br/><br/>The chick that played Ananck Su Namun is back, and apparently she wanted a speaking role this time.  Bad Idea.  The Rock out acted her.  Not the wrestler, one of the rocks on film.  Not that good acting would have saved this plotless chunk of filth.  If you want decent characterization, I guess they thought it would carry over from the first movie.  The actors were there for filler in between pointless special effects, and dumb fight scenes.  (If you're a fan of either, forget what I've said, go see it, enjoy.)<br/><br/>Plot holes, oh the plot holes.  Big enough to pass the Giza Pyramid through. How did Oded GET to england, much less to Rick's mansion?  He says he's never been on a bus before.  Evie is a kung-fu chick?  Why didn't these neato abilities kick in in the first movie??? They sure as heck woulda been useful.  Rick is a magi?  Does he need a DAMN reason to fight the mummy? Flashback to Ancient Egyptian Foxy Boxing, why?  The huge honkin' tropical rainforest...around a PYRAMID...in the middle of a DESERT!!!  No one noticed this before?  Seems odd in a world filled with ROCKET POWERED BALLOONS!!! Sorry, suspension of disbelief only goes so far...jets...we didn't even HAVE JETS THEN!!! That guy would have made some serious money with his inventions.  I know the Germans woulda been interested...<br/><br/>And the special effects...sure, they're impressive...but they don't make a movie ""Good"" in my book.  Case in point, Dragonheart.  Nuff said.  Goin' to see a bad movie for good special effects is akin to goin' to the circus to gawk at the ""Freak Show"".  Well, looky that.  If that don't beat all! They're nice, they're gravy...but I'd rather have a well made movie.  And the Scorpion/Rock...man, flashback to Clash of the Titans.  Ray Harryhausen is turnin' over in his grave...if he's dead.  I hope not, Ray's a good man. But this...guh.<br/><br/>I'm not alone in my feelings either.  Pretty much all in the theater felt this way.  When the balloon thrusters kicked in, I screamed and threw a bottle of mountain dew at the screen.  Many others followed suit.<br/><br/>Okay...guess that's it.  I tried to stay calm and rational...I guess I coulda sent in a comment that was just full of screaming and profanity...which was going on in the car on the way home...but I figured this has a better chance of being put up as a warning.  If you liked the first one at all, I don't think you'll like this one much.  If you're just looking for a stupid summer movie...go ahead, it's YOUR soul. Peace."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>My disappointment in this film was profound.<br/><br/>Most films are ordinary, and being ordinary are about other films. In this case, the precedent is Indiana Jones which added a comic book perspective to the well-established genre of mummy curse films. The key elements (from both Lucas and Spielberg) were chases and humor. The kernel of the idea comes from an enterprising reporter who formed a cosmic revenge story around the discovery of Tutankamen's undisturbed tomb in the 1922s.<br/><br/>That tomb (as all such tombs) cursed the disturbers (`death shall come on swift wings to him who disturbs the peace of the king') and Lord Carnarvon, the first man to enter did indeed perish soon after of a strange malady. There are even fresh arguments concerning mold spores. 11 others also died mysteriously. Around that curse were resurrected cosmic battles about the powers of gods and the nature of the afterlife. (A near contemporary, Akhenaton, lost the battle but won the war on this matter as a tribe of semites later left Egypt and founded the one-god, belief-of-the-book, modern-heaven religion that now permeates the west.) Comic book versions followed.<br/><br/>This is great stuff around which one can spin a popular tale of terror from the afterlife. To Indiana, the first Sommers Mummy movie added some novel computer work, which still amazes us. But the core notion of reach from the afterlife was relatively preserved. Here, the same team used the theory of more to produce a mess, preserving nothing.<br/><br/>We still have massive computer graphics, and for a year or two more, we will still marvel. But the underlying structure has no soul, it has inexplicably been tossed, leaving us without a footing for our thrills.<br/><br/>Simple stuff: Fraser has a greater comedic range than celebrity franchise Harrison Ford, but humor is rare here.<br/><br/>Instead of one good guy, we have a whole extended family, plus the `good arab.' The chief guy - we discover - is destined to save the world (as designated by a tattoo). The chief girl is the reincarnated good girl (so she can play both the good daughter and good mom). Its confusing whether the kid is special - tapped by fate - or just stumbles on the bracelet.<br/><br/>Instead of one bad guy, we have: the scheming museum curator (and his unexplained sect); the reincarnated (in body only -  whatever that means) bad girl; the bad mummy priest; the more powerful scorpion warrior-king who himself is a hireling of someone we don't meet; the black guy who has some special role; the moriarty gang; and the pygmy demons.<br/><br/>Instead of one magic, we have the 12 tribes of  Magi (clearly related to the magic of the word); the magic of the books; the magic of the spear, bracelet, diamond (which will factor in the sequel); the magic of the scorpion curse; the magic ofthe mummy's curse. But despite all this magic, everything revolves around fights with knives. How quaint.<br/><br/>Instead of one vision of the underworld, it is: a parking place for demons to be recalled from, sort of a suspended animation zone; or a Dante-like place of eternal torture. Neither is particularly Egyptian.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the sense of place. Many of the sets are lush. We are supposed to feel the sense of (in turn) ratty Egypt; lux London; spectacular desert + train; ancient magical Egypt. Think now - were they successful with any location? Did you get any feel of magic, like say even `Stargate' conveyed? Were you awed by the visions the bracelet produced?<br/><br/>Worse: the horror was all mouth horror. You know, Disney is accused of his humor (the stuff he wrote) being mostly butt humor. Check out all the `scares' here - they are all open mouths. Does this lack imagination? Worse yet, here we have two pernicious stereotypes of American blacks: the feral, muscular buck (`I's gonna keel you') and the goldtoothed stepinfetchit (`don't shoot me in the butt.') Wasn't anybody checking behind this guy?<br/><br/>So no soul. Only two moments of camera art: flashes on Fraser when entering the pyramid, and 20 seconds of stop-blur on Bey during the battle (against a supposedly invincible demon army).<br/><br/>The only touch of class was with the closing credits."

","From the start, I hated this movie with a passion when I saw it. The only reason I rented it in the first place was because the first was enjoyable and fun, but this was unbearable. Brendan Fraiser and Rachel Weiz's son was stubborn and over-courageous, which would be fine if he could shut up with his lame comments every five seconds. His British accent (where'd that come from?) didn't help matters. The story in this sequel is considerably worse than the first, which was never great but could at least grab attention. It's always a bad sign when somehow people are able to be brought back to life over and over, therefore killing excitement or suspense during action. In the end, I didn't have any more endurance and the last ten minutes went right over my head (but what I do remember wasn't any good either)."

","After seeing the ""Mummy,"" and enjoying it a great deal, the sequel was an enormous letdown.  The plot elements (what little of them there were) I found contrived... my husband and I were actually laughing out loud at parts we can only presume the director intended not to be humorous (as were others in the movie theater).<br/><br/>I was rooting for the Mummy (Vosloo) to ""eat"" the protagonists (excepting Oded Fehr), unfortunately ""Rick"" and ""Evy"" were simply too two-dimensional to make a decent meal....  For me the best part of the movie was the fight scene at the end... NOT because of horrid ""special"" effects with the Scorpion King, but because of Arnold Vosloo's beefy bod (stripped to the trews, by gum!).<br/><br/>Can be entertaining if viewed under the influence of a great dose of satirical humor."

","First, let me tell you that I did not hate ""The mummy"". It was light, fresh funny and action packed and it never tried to take itself too seriously. I cannot say the same of the sequel.<br/><br/>First of all, it lost its originality. Not only is it ""inspired"" by the first film, it plagiarize entire parts of it (the kids who destroys all the temple's pillars as his mother did with the library in the first installment, the huge face of Imothep in the water trying to swallow our heroes hot air balloon compared to the same face in the sandstorm trying to swallow the light airplane).<br/><br/>Then, there are those other movie influences: A final battle between the heroes and the arch-enemies while outside, good troops are fighting with an army so much more powerful (Did I hear someone say Star Wars?). Women fighting with various bladed weapons and running on walls (Why did I think of Crouching Tiger?) A perfectly swell gentleman turning to be the leader of a cult which our heroes spy from above(Have you seen Indianna Jones and the Temple of Doom?)<br/><br/>Otherwise, the story have been left out and it's just action scene over action scene with a couple of in jokes to lighten up the atmosphere and remind us of how ""the mummy"" was so much more better than this dumb sequel.<br/><br/>
By the way, could anyone tell me how ""The Rock"" got his name in top billing when he only appears on screen for a couple of minutes."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","4","6","27 October 2006"," A 'Bad' movie that is fun to watch
","Of all my 200-something reviews here, this proves the most difficult to write. How do you justify a film so overtly poor in all traditional aspects? Maybe you don't  maybe it is enough that I leave you with my titular summary and hope you will have as much fun as I did watching 'The Mummy Returns'.<br/><br/>Yet I could not to do this because it is a film that demands some evaluation. First, there are many many things wrong with this Mummy installment: its screenplay is a sketchbook mess with gaping plot holes, it suffers from the sequel-hubris of being 'big, bigger, epic', its one-liners are often wristslashingly cringeworthy, the villain characters are frighteningly flat, the animated pygmies some 2/3s into the movie are a joke, and on that note the CGI is so inexplicably bad that it may actually wound you to watch just five years later (it is bizarrely much worse than in the first Mummy film), and lastly there is an unbearably annoying young-Anakin-like boy  Rick and Evelyn's son  whom is given far too much importance in the story and far too much screen time in the film. In other words, 'The Mummy Returns' is camp of Batman and Robin-like proportions.<br/><br/>But my god, it is quite possibly the most well-executed and entertaining camp I have ever seen. Its predecessor 'The Mummy (1999)' proves a wonderful little Indiana Jones romp with a crisp freshness and beautiful settings. 'Returns' is equally sprawling with stunning ancient Egyptian locations and buildings but much of the novelty of the whole premise has regrettably worn off from the first film. It therefore goes to great lengths to compensate for its sequel-shortcomings by dishing out everything on a larger scale. This means kinetic, dynamic heartstopping action in all kinds of time eras with all kinds of scope. It is also, thanks to this no-nonsense approach, bathed in urgency which means no slow-paced moments to reflect on its quality.<br/><br/>The pinnacle of 'The Mummy Returns' success is its characters. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz undoubtedly have a remarkably comedic rapport that was fully showcased when the series kick-started, and is equally engrossing this time around. Although these two are the goldmine of the film, it offers plenty of goodies from the rest of its cast. Oded Fehr and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are excellent and fun to watch in their respective parts, as is the triumvirate of goofy comedic-sidekick-ish badguys with their assigned quirks. It is constantly poised on the brink of silliness, but then, so is Pirates of the Caribbean and the mainstream audience is crazy about that series. <br/><br/>I strongly believed that this is a highly underrated film in terms of entertainment value and it is a shame Fraser wasn't showered with awards for his hilarious performance.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"Knuckle","1","7","13","8 April 2006"," Why is Sommers still making movies?
","As fatuous as the first Mummy movie was, it had a certain goofy charm to it. The characters were marginally likable and a few scenes here and there made me chuckle.<br/><br/>The sequel, however, is a monstrosity. It lacks all the cleverness and innocent goodwill of the first movie, which leads me to believe the rumors I hear that a) the first movie benefited from massive uncredited rewrites and b) the same ghost writers left Sommers to his own devices for the second after getting shafted on credit for the first movie.<br/><br/>So here we have it, a clear portrait of Stephen Sommers' film-making abilities and they are meager. As a writer he gives us some real gems of dialog. You know that any movie that has a kid say, ""My dad's gonna kick you a**,"" is going to be a real stinker. The rub in this situation comes when you realize that it's the best line in the movie.<br/><br/>CGI effects dominate this movie and they are bad. Everything from the midget mummies to the flying boat zeppelin looks fake and stupid.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time. This movie was a monumental waste of time and money.<br/><br/>1 out of 10."

","After the first Mummy' movie that was very bright and entertaining my family eagerly awaited for this one Well, there are few comments here. The plot is strange (and definitely not half as good as in the first part); the heroes' behavior is more then weird (what parents can totally neglect their son and say how much they love him), the special effects' are so overdone (unfortunately computer-animation current software did not reach the stage of perfection yet), and by the way it is not Rachel Weisz the one who should have been working out more in the gym (she was a beautiful woman before and became like any other anorexoid now) but Brendan Fraser whose moves wish for much better"
"notdempsey","2","7","15","26 December 2004"," Maintains the fun of its predecessor at the expense of any dignity the franchise had left.
","Early in ""The Mummy Returns,"" sequel to Universal's 1999 blockbuster remake ""The Mummy,"" charming American swashbuckler Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) fights a cadre of decomposed Egyptian corpses on the back of a London double-decker. Also on the bus is Rick's wife/scholar Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), to whom he laments, ""This is bad!"" ""We've had bad before,"" Evelyn replies. Rick: ""This is worse!"" Indeed! As is the whole of ""The Mummy Returns,"" a film so ludicrously over the top and blindly made that even after Warner Brothers' dismal ""Wild Wild West"" featuring jets retrofitted to a flying bicycle, this film put the jets on a flying boat.<br/><br/>Explaining the plot of ""The Mummy Returns"" in detail is about as necessary as cooking directions on Pop-Tarts: Ten-or-so years after the events in ""The Mummy,"" Rick and Evelyn must search the globe for their son Alex (Freddie Boath) who, after trying on a bracelet that was actually an ancient artifact belonging to a Babylonian-era warlord named The Scorpion King (The Rock), becomes a human map to a mythical oasis where The King awaits an opponent who, if victorious, will take control of his armies and have the power to rule the world. The kidnapper was none other than Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), the eponymous ghoul and former high priest thwarted by O'Connell in the first film, now resurrected by the voluptuous Meela Nais (Patricia Valasquez), reincarnation of Anck Su Namun, the ancient beauty whom Imhotep shared a fatal affair with thousands of years ago. The evil pair plan to find the oasis and defeat The Scorpion King, and thus, like a biblical Bonnie and Clyde, set the whole gory story into motion.<br/><br/>And those are just the broad strokes! Along the way we encounter the usual hoards of faceless, black-cloaked baddies with guns, the not-so-usual undead soldiers, and the flat-out weird and nasty little pygmy-mummies--everything coated with the oh-so-easy-to-swallow zombie in-jokes of ghouls bobbling their own decapitated heads.<br/><br/>All that said, ""The Mummy Returns"" maintains all the fun of its predecessor (if only at the expense of any dignity the franchise had left.) This is a movie that knows it's bad (and boy is it bad!), that knows it's the ultimate product of the Hollywood machine--and is damn proud of it! It's undeniably great to see O'Connell leap and tumble his way out of ridiculously overwhelming odds--literally one wrong step from being horribly gored in front of his child. At the film's climax, O'Connell is engaged in a battle against the new and CGI improved Scorpion King (complete with giant scorpion legs and torso). As I watched Brendan Fraser (and/or his stuntman) dodge the unstoppable claws of the rendered-Rock's intimidating mandible, it occurred to me that I hadn't seen such wickedly intense choreography of actor and CGI since Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore tangoed beautifully with a pair of hungry velociraptors in ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" (another enjoyable franchise-destroyer). For ""The Mummy Returns,"" VFX supervisor John Andrew Burton Jr. and a very extended team brought this sequence to life.<br/><br/>Fraser has always plunged headfirst into roles that even the most work-starved actor might shy away from (""Encino Man,"" ""Looney Toons: Back In Action,"" ""Monkeybone""), and does so with such enthusiasm that we never feel embarrassed for him. Here he embraces Rick O'Connell in all his two-dimensionality where others might abandon the role, and the character survives because of him.<br/><br/>Joining Rick and Evelyn are Evelyn's unscrupulous-yet-lovable bro Jonathan (John Hannah) and the melodramatic guru-warrior Ardeth Bey (that dude with all the Arabic writing on his cheeks, played by Oded Fehr), who also serves as the film's interim historian, giving us any and all back story needed without all the bother of exposition or creative storytelling. An enjoyable chemistry and timing has developed between these actors in just two films. There truly is a sense of camaraderie; We find it quite easy, for example, to accept Jonathan's momentary turn of seriousness toward the end of the film after two acts of comedy because the other actors know just how to respond to him (Hannah is possibly the best Scottish actor alive, see ""Sliding Doors"").<br/><br/>Of course, the bulk of the film is lighthearted, and any melodrama is taken with a grain of salt--not least of all by screenwriter/director Sthephen Sommers, who plays up the group-fun-breeziness that worked so well with the first mummy movie; Upon seeing the forbidden bracelet on Alex's arm, Ardeth decrees grimly, ""By putting on the bracelet, you have started a chain reaction that could bring about the next apocalypse."" Fraser looks at Ardeth, ""Hey, you, lighten up."" I suppose that's Sommers' best and only defense against critics like Peter Travers of Rolling Stone who (justifiably) called his film ""A p!ss poor mummy movie indeed that doesn't deliver a damn thing worth preserving.""<br/><br/>""Hey, Peter, lighten up."""

","It's sad to see what could have been an excellent sequel turned into just another stupid movie of stupid action. The bases for a great story are there, but it was very poorly delivered. The adorable heroes seem to have another personality, causing them to lose the chemistry between them from the first movie, much because of the script and the dialogues, especially Evelyn who in this film discovers - see the stupidity - to be the reincarnation of the princess ""warrior"" Nefertiri, which makes her a woman of guns instead of the charming half-snobbish girl of the first movie, the purpose of this so she can have some fight sequences with Anksunamun, the lover Imotep wants to resurrect.<br/><br/>What really irritates me is that in the end Anksunamun turns her back on Imotep by betraying him to death. Why?!? Does not make sense. Why would she have killed the Pharaoh and committed suicide for Imotep's sake now to turn her back on him? That was part of the charm of these villains: even though they were evil, they had this human spark - they loved each other. But I also have to admit that from the entire movie - from the WHOLE movie - that was the only scene that really messed with me so cruel it was. If they had to die then it should be together: she would try to save him but she would fail, both falling into the abyss with the souls pushing them away and taking them to the bottom as they try in vain to hold hands. Would not this end be more beautiful and even more tragic and appropriate?<br/><br/>Alex, the son, is funny in the role of ""smart kid"" but unnecessary to the plot, and the sequence in which he leaves the clues to his parents in plain sight for all to see is very badly thought so much in terms of writing as accomplishment. The whole film is exaggerated: the action is exaggerated (now the mummies run along walls and ceilings), comedy and goofiness and animation are exaggerated, too many special effects obviously unfinished that do not mix well at all with the rest of the background unlike the first movie. This is one of those cases where LESS would be MORE. And it makes me sad that the fantastic first movie does not have a better reputation because of these horrible sequels."
"ivo-cobra8","9","2","3","5 December 2015"," A great underrated sequel in the Mummy action genre franchise!
","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a few action fantasy sequels, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns (2001) was my second movie during summer 2001 in the mummy series franchise that I went to see it in the movie theater that year. This time I went alone during the summer watching this movie. This flick become one of my favorite action adventure movies. It is my favorite Mummy flick and I don't care what anyone says I love it! I bought VHS tape in 2003, unfortunately I don't have that tape anymore, but I got it on Blu-ray disc and I love it so much. The year's biggest action-adventure is coming home with a vengeance! Brendan Fraser and an all-star cast reunite with Stephen Sommers for explosive, non-stop thrills in ""the ultimate roller-coaster movie ride!"" Brendan Fraser ,Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Patricia Velasquez and Oded Fehr returns from the first movie and reunite for the second time of the Mummy franchise with some new additions on the cast Freddie Boath and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. It's as good as the first film in the aspect of special effects, but it is just as entertaining and comical as the first film. I love the first film and I love this film, the story is brilliant and the actors give brilliant performances. But like I said some of the special effects are terrible like the first appearance of the animated Scorpion King, he just looks really bad. Apart from that The Mummy Returns is an hilarious and highly entertaining film. A must for fans of the franchise! <br/><br/>A lot of the critics were unkind to this movie but they were missing the point: it's just fun all the way﻿. They only dropped the ball on the CG scorpion king in my opinion. Brilliant movies﻿. I felt my soul freaking escape when I heard Arnold speak Imhotep was my favorite character and still is! What I love about this movie: The Mummy and The Mummy Returns reminds me on The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Both of the movie did had returning cast and they ere both much different dark tone, characters. I think The Mummy Returns copied or borrowed scenes from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This film is set 10 years after the vents on the first movie an ancient legacy of terror is unleashed when the accursed mummy, Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), is resurrected - along with a force even more powerful: The Scorpion King (The Rock). Now, as the fate of all mankind hangs in the balance, Rick O'Connell (Fraser) and his wife Evie (Rachel Weisz) embark on a daring, desperate race to save their son - and the world - from unspeakable evil. <br/><br/>I have enjoyed this movie in every way and I love that movie isn't boring but has action and it is set in different locations beside the Egypt. It has action, humor and great performances by the actors in it. In my opinion I think The Mummy is superior and much better than this movie, but this sequel isn't bad either and it is a good summer blockbuster movie. I always enjoy even today when every time I see it. The acting is pretty good, though sometimes things become a little hammy. The writing and directing are also well done, this is like the mini-version of what Indiana Jones could be -- though that may be too big a compliment. <br/><br/>The flaws and the problems I have with the film are: the CGI were messed up this time around; it did not meet up with those from the first film! Some characters were in a dark tone this time. The character Evie Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) was really in a dark tone and way, way too hot I really did not like that in the movie. Not that I did not like it, in the movie the past life of Evelyn really confused me, when she was Princess Nefertiri a princess warrior when Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velásquez) killed her father the emperor. Suddenly Evie was a bad ass! Just like Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from The Terminator from a shy girl to a bad ass in sequel. That is why I am saying this movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The special-effects are TERRIBLE! The Scorpion King looks so fake! The army of Anubis looks fake! Everything that had to be inserted digitally comes out terrible. That is the main problems in the film that I had. <br/><br/>The last ting I wanna say: when the full force of Anubis' army is bearing down and outnumbered, the Medjai prepare to make their last stand everyone in the theater was cheering up with them when Ardeth Bay screams his line: 'Till Death! Everyone was cheering up for them. As everything was said, I love this movie and everyone did a great job and I love this movie to death! I gave a 9/10 if they wouldn't be any flaws in it or weren't things that bothered me in it. <br/><br/>The Mummy Returns is a 2001 American action adventure film written and directed by Stephen Sommers, starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr, Patricia Velásquez, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.

"gigan-92","7","2","3","23 March 2010"," All in All a Decent Sequel
","Two years later and here comes the sequel. So who's ready for even more thrills?? Stephen Sommers once again directs and fans of the first will be pleased. This film seems less horror-like, less dark, and so I don't think it can surpass the first but don't get me wrong it's far from being a dud of a sequel. John Hannah is back!! In fact, all of the actors from the previous film return, much to my delight, although are there a few new characters of course. For one there's a kid in this film, something that worried me a bit at first in the trailers. But he doesn't distract audiences from the really important characters, and so I can live with his existence. Also, the sexy Patricia Vasquez plays a much larger role in this film as Imhotep's re-incarnated girlfriend. The story is a bit longer-feeling but it keeps you interested, the important part.<br/><br/>Now, the SFX are outrageously well executed for the most part, but a few things were a tad bit questionable. First off, I love the end battle. It's dramatic, sad, and definitely Sommers-material. But the close-ups of The Rock as the Scorpion King were a bit too, well odd looking. His body didn't seem to blend well if you ask me. Another scene was Imhotep's suicide scene, which is tragic but is almost ruined by the look of this crevice of lost souls or whatever you want to call it. It looked rather unconvincing unfortunately. Pushing those aside, the Anubis army was quite simply stunning.<br/><br/>This time around, Alan Silvestri does the score and he does a good enough job, though I find it would've been better if Jerry Goldsmith had returned instead. But all in all, it is a decent sequel, serving its place as an adventure/action thriller."

John Hannah is hilarious once again, and cracked me up throughout and brought great comic relief. Arnold Vosloo is fantastic, only problem is he is not the only clear villain in this so he didn't have as much to do, still he had tons of presence!, i really dug him. Oded Fehr is very good here again i really like his character and he fought very well!.The Rock didn't have to act here in his role, but he rocked anyways!, More of him would have been nice!.

"IntoTheAirwaves17","9","2","3","8 July 2005"," Great Movie!!!
","This was a great movie that I think is better than the first but then again, you can't beat the original right? I loved The Mummy but what I love even more is how the characters develop 10 years later. There is a lot of VFX but if you listen to the commentary you will find some reasons as to why some of the places were created in VFX (mostly because in the back of most of these cities are skyscrapers).<br/><br/>Again, Imhotep is brought back as the main villain but the Scorpion King is also brought into the plot which makes it a little more interesting by putting more depth into the story and having Imhotep fear him. Our good guys, the O'Connells are also mixed in a little more by making this story personal with the kidnapping of their son, Alex.<br/><br/>Imhotep is still pretty much the same character as was before but now Anack-Su-Namun is in this movie a lot more which makes him be kind of protective of her. Anack-Su-Namun is now obviously more than a CG animation undead mummy, she is now reincarnated but only in body as Meela. Imhotep soon brings her soul back from the underworld though. Evy has also had more depth because we learn that she and Rick are more connected to the story than we thought. Evy is a reincarnated princess and Rick is apparently a Madjai. Evy has also changed from being the librarian for the Cario Museum to an archaeologist who in Racel Weisz's words ""hooked on adrenaline"". Johnathon is well, still the same old Johnathon.<br/><br/>The acting and portrayal of all of the characters was done very well. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz both did a fantastic job portraying their characters. You could see that together they had great chemistry and also they did well in developing but somehow keeping the same characters that we know. Rachel had to change Evy into more of an included person in the action sequences and show how much 10 years changed Evelyn. Brendan had to basically keep his same character from before and also develop him just a little like make him more into the dad type character, which he did very well with. Overall I think The Mummy Returns is a great movie to watch over and over with friends, family or whomever else you choose."
"Snow-20","8","2","3","23 February 2002"," Satisfying and funny
","After seeing 'The Mummy' in 1999, i was impressed with the plot, characters and special effects. I couldn't wait for the follow up 'The Mummy Returns' and when finally I saw it in the cinema, I was not disappointed. This is an action-packed film which never stops and has very many funny one-liners as well, Arded 'This was my first bus ride' after the fight against the mummies on the bus.<br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/>The movie starts with the Scorpion King (played by The Rock) and his army going into battle and being defeated. They are driven into the desert, where one by one they all perish, until the King is the only survivor. He makes a pact with the god Anubis that he will give him his soul if he spares his life. This offer is accepted and from then on, the Scorpion King is a slave to the god Anubis. Meanwhile, Rick and Evie find the bracelet of Anubis which has the power to release the army of Anubis, which could mean the world will be destroyed etc. The mummy Imohteb is resurrected in the British Museum and also in the film is his love Anck-su-namun from the first film who has been reincarnated.<br/><br/>All this plus many action sequences such as the bus-ride on the red London bus where Rick nearly gets killed and Arded nearly gets sliced and diced by those oh-so-nasty nails of one of the mummies!<br/><br/>I particularly liked the flashback scenes to Ancient Egypt, and was shocked but pleasantly surprised to see how everything fitted in to place like Evie who was Princess Nefertiri, daughter of the Pharoah, and her witnessing the murder of her father by Anck-su-namun and Imohteb. The fight between the two women was especially good, and highlights the rivalry between them. We also find out that Rick is a warrior for God, a Medji, (the same as Arded) from the tattoo/birthmark on his wrist, and obviously he is a reincarnation of the Medji from Ancient Egypt also.<br/><br/>The funny lines in the film are classic:<br/><br/>Izzy: You're not exactly catching me at my best Evelyn: Oh I'm sure I am<br/><br/>Alex on the toilet: Hey, reading material!<br/><br/>I burst out laughing at that line of Alex's and especially the look on Lock-Nah's face when Alex says, 'You'll look'<br/><br/>Coming to Lock-Nah, this is a good part played by a good actor. He is totally believable, although his hatred of the kid was a little overplayed. I like the scene where he strikes with the knife which lands between Alex's fingers. Alex, 'Wooah. Perfect aim' Lock-Nah, 'What are you talking about? I missed'<br/><br/>Evie looks much more stunning in this film, and her character is really likeable. She seems to have come outof her shell a bit more since the first movie. She steals the movie from Rick,although he is funny and suits the part.<br/><br/>I really like Oded Fehr who plays Arded, the Medji. He is a quiet hero and should not be forgotten. He could have had more lines. He is brave, relentless in stopping Imohteb/the army of Anubis/world destruction etc and should have had more of a major role.<br/><br/>Patricia Velasquez, beautiful girl and its good that she had more screentime than in the Mummy, where she was in it for only the first 10 minutes. Although my only major complaint about the whole movie was the part at the end where the rocks are falling in the pyramid, and Evie goes to save Rick. Imohteb calls out to Anck-su-namun to help him and she runs away without helping him.This breaks his heart and he lets himself be taken to die. Now, before Imohteb had left her to go and face the Scorpion King, she had said, 'No I don't want you to go. I don't want to lose you again' After saying that, (and anyway these guys are MEANT to be together through all time) she wouldn't have left him to die. She would have saved him. so i think that the scriptwriters let themselves down there. They could at least have kept the couples love strong, and maybe they could have died together in the pyramid to be resurrected again one day maybe...<br/><br/>Anyway, to sum it all up, this movies great, and I will probably check out the Scorpion King, however it hasn;t got any of the characters from the Mummy films in apart from The Rock. I heard that there was going to be another Mummy film and they would go back in time and it would be about everything that happened in Ancient Egypt which has all the major characters in which sounds amazing but has anyone else heard that?"

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOI I love this sequel to 'The Mummy'.  It had everything, action, adventure, comedy, martial arts, great special effects and the basic cast from the first movie. Stephen Sommers is a great director and he & the casting director casted once again, a charismatic cast.  I liked the cast a lot.  From Brendan Fraser & Rachel Weisz to Arnold Vosloo and his Sports Illustrated model, Patricia Velazquez to Oded Fehr, John Hannah & the Rock.  I even liked Freddie Boath (usually kid actors annoy me e.g. the Olsen Twins, Tina Majorina, the Culkins coz they're taught to overact.  but Freddie pulled off a grand performance in my p.o.v.) and I also liked the 'This Box/Chest/Place is cursed!' guy.  He was funny. I liked how the plot ran in with the first Mummy eg how Evie was Princess Nefertiri reincarnate and how her son was the chosen one and how Ardeth Bay, Jonathan Carnahan and Rick O'Connell were all the Pharoah's Guards in their pastlives.  (You know, Jonathan to protect Evie from birth, Rick to protect her in love and Ardeth to protect them all). The only thing I reckon could have been done better was the death of Anck-Su-Namun.  Did she really need to die like that... or even at all? The way Jonathan managed to get the Diamond at the end was expected and well done.  It's just Anck-Su-Namun's death really was uncalled for but understandable.<br/><br/>All in all a great future classic, I give it a 8/10."

"Hussain-AL-Naseer","8","1","1","14 May 2020"," The Mummy & The Mummy Returns
","The Mummy and The Mummy Returns both are my all time favorite movies as the Cinematic experience I got with both the movies on single screen theater is just I can not forget. Both films are the visual gems and has the capability to give you a great visual experience of ancient Egypt.
Action sequences, storytelling, Cinematography, Art, Costumes , Sets and CGI effects are some of the aspects to look for.
Both the films are blended with Humor, Emotions and some thrilling moments which may bring you to the edges. Director Stephen Sommers has effortlessly done his job to keep the audience intact with his crisp direction. The Screenplay articulated well especially in the second installment as story unfolds and connects with its first installment .
Never forgetting the performances which also contributed equally to make this franchise worth watching. Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connel is surely the Heart and Soul of the movie, the Hero larger then life Macho, Blunt and Brave Fraser has nailed it, he was also exceptional as a caring Father and a lovable Husband in the second installment, Rick O'Connel is the best character Bredan has ever played supported toe to toe by Rachel Weisz as Evelyn Carnahan, Arnold Vasloo as Imotep has done good job as most of his role was behind CGI but he is the proper villain we got in the movie, Patricia Velásquez, John Hannah & Oded Fehr all justified their presence and supported well to the leads.
What ruined this franchise was its third installment even Jet Li as main Antagonist couldn't save it. Rachel Weisz & director Stephen Sommers absence felt greatly and Alex as grown up is something that I didn't buy as the little Alex in second installment was Brave kid just like his father which was all lost in third installment."

"TheMovieDiorama","6","1","1","30 July 2019"," The Mummy Returns for another sandy CGI adventure, tossing out character development off of the dirigible.
","Bigger is not always better (unless you are a size queen...). Clearly, both Sommers and the ancient pharaohs failed to capitalise on this ethos, with colossal pyramids, temples and undead armies towering over the O'Connell's. Yet despite the plague of special effects that have tainted the lands of Egypt, turning it into an outdated polygonal desert, this is still an incredibly enjoyable adventure flick that harks back to the 'Indiana Jones' era of films. I miss those days! After activating the Bracelet of Anubis, the O'Connell's must prevent a newly resurrected Imhotep from slaying the Scorpion King, granting him control over Anubis' army.<br/><br/>Right, let's address the camel in the oasis. The Scorpion King. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Merging into one. It looked abhorrently terrible back in '01 and I can damn well guarantee you it still looks like the dark side of Anubis' buttocks today. That is just one example of various ""revolutionary"" special effects that either look out of place or are atrociously rendered. Some, mostly environmental details, still hold up well. Most, do not. So to align the film's focus on haphazard visuals rather than the characters themselves, well, it makes for light entertainment at best. There are some droplets of personable qualities, especially with Rick and Evelyn, but with a large array of returning and new characters, it was just too much. Too many travellers in this desert, y'know what I mean!<br/><br/>Regardless, Sommers is able to keep the narrative flowing and showcase a plethora of set pieces that are sure to bring some excitement, even if certain sub-plots like Anck-Su-Namun's reincarnation are underdeveloped. Whether it be a barrage of mummified pygmies killing everyone or a car chase in downtown London, it's always kept brisk and enjoyable. The cast does not need any dusting, with them all performing adequately (damn I miss Fraser...). And Silvestri's score is a definite highlight, enhancing that enjoyable nature even further.<br/><br/>Substituting the horror found in its predecessor for a straight up adventure flick was probably the best move Sommers could make, but more attention to the characters was needed to truly add that much required Egyptian spice. Decent sequel, but falling for the ""bigger is better"" trap. Let's just not discuss the spin-off or sequel...or reboot..."

I'm an old guy and I remember as a kid in the 50's seeing the 1932 version with Boris Karloff on Nightmare Theater on TV Friday night. It might have been scary, don't remember but it always made me appreciate the whole idea of a mummy. I like The Mummy from 1999 and was excited to see The Mummy Returns with all the originals. I will say that if Dwayne Johnson had stuck around playing the Scorpion King his career would have gone bye-bye. I liked all the actors here and I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay deserves every good role he's had since then. Silly story, great special effects if a little ragged at times but it's still a worthy continuation of the original. Now then, maybe 5 years from now I'll come back again or I might watch The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, although probably not."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","1","1","1 December 2018"," 'Scorpion King' aside, this is an enjoyable and effective sequel.
","'The Mummy Returns (2001)' isn't just a carbon copy of the first and takes a few decent steps in evolving the franchise's formula, though it does get a little too grand - and silly - for its own good. It also keeps up the same fun tone and slightly irreverent feel, which makes for an overall enjoyable experience. It does, however, feel a bit tamer this time and isn't quite as tight overall. Still, everything is painted with a broadly fantastical brush and the flick introduces some fairly unique back-story elements that surely provided inspiration for Sofia Boutella's recent incarnation of the bandaged boogeyman. When 'The Rock' turns up as a fully CG creature, things take a turn for the worse, though; that particular special effect is still possibly one of the worst I've seen in a piece of this size. Nevertheless, the movie is an entertaining time, despite its few flaws. 7/10"

","And what happened? The Mummy Returns is far from a bad flick. It is still a massively entertaining adventure, but it just seems...odd? Here there be mysteries...but don't worry you don't have to see the first one to really understand the second. It's not that type of movie.<br/><br/>But it is challenging. It challenges you to get past the...well, let me bring you up to speed.<br/><br/>Fraser the foolhardy adventurer and Weisz the lost in her own world Archaeologist got together in the first film and are still together in the second, only now it's been a few years and they have a little kid.<br/><br/>Hannah is still around playing the brother and black sheep of the family. Vosloo is still the mummy. Fehr is still the guardian of whatever society and the bulk of the film still takes place in Egypt.<br/><br/>But it is challenging. It challenges you to keep up with the inconsistencies. Honestly, they are just pulling plot points out of hammer-space in this one. They are adding backstories that would have been insanely relevant in the first film had they thought they were going to make a sequel...<br/><br/>...but they didn't and rather than writing a follow-up that would stay consistent film they threw caution to the wind and opted to just make everything up and hope the audience went along with it.<br/><br/>And we did.<br/><br/>Because, let's face it, it's not exactly Shakespeare. We weren't expecting Richard the II. Honestly, if you can't follow it, you have an IQ below 80 and if the blatant inconsistencies upset you so much you can't get around them than you are taking life way too seriously for your own good.<br/><br/>This is a popcorn popper. This is a soda sucker. This is a sit down in your chair and enjoy the campy-fun ride.<br/><br/>The audience walked into The Mummy Returns expecting an adventure film that delivered action and humor and that is exactly what they got.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that, despite its massive flaws, The Mummy Returns is still entertaining and that is all it is, Entertainment. Capital E there.<br/><br/>If you want a heady work of cinematic brilliance...well, you shouldn't be watching this. This movie had one job and it pulled it off soundly."
"bowmanblue","7","1","1","11 January 2015"," Good, but not – quite – as good as the first
","The first 'Mummy' film was a classic. No, not in the 'Godfather' kind of way. No, it certainly won't be remembered as one of the greats when it comes to the history of cinema. However, it was a fun little film which has its place on TV on a Saturday afternoon. It was a good action-adventure film which could be enjoyed by all the family without much of a need for brainpower.<br/><br/>Yes, it could be looked at as a 'poor man's Indiana Jones,' but it was just such fun it should be afforded some of its misgivings and simply enjoyed for what it was. So, because of its simple success (and commercial, obviously), a sequel was quickly greenlit. The second instalment certainly gets a fair few things right, yet it never quite gels together like the first. Not that's it's bad, it's just not – quite – as good as the first.<br/><br/>The best thing about it is the cast. They all return from the original. And it's nice to see the two central characters (Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) don't need to fall in love all over again. They're married now and they have a child, Alex, who's not as annoying as 99% of the children we see in films. In fact, instead of Rik having to rescue Evelyn constantly, the two of them have to rescue their son. Yes, the Mummy does indeed return (never mind how he was firmly killed and dragged to hell in the first instalment. He's now back, okay?) and wants to borrow the mythical 'Scorpion King's' army with which he can then take over the world again. Unfortunately, little Alex just so happens to have the only bracelet attached to him, so he's captured and subsequently dragged half way around the world into to raise the army.<br/><br/>One of the things 'The Mummy Returns' will always be known for is that it's the first filmic outing for 'The Rock' (better known nowadays as, former wrestler, Dwayne Johnson). He plays the Scorpion King himself – a secondary villain, also not the type you want to get hold of either your only son, or an army capable of taking over the world. It's a brave attempt to crowbar another villain into the mix, but he's not properly in it until the final showdown, therefore the main villain we go with is the Mummy, simply because he was in the first film and is basically in the second outing all the way through.<br/><br/>So, The Mummy Returns sits nicely alongside its predecessor in the 'Saturday matinée' type of film. It too will be enjoyed by most families with a sense of humour and a forgiving nature towards daft films. But it's not perfect. It's hard to explain exactly what's wrong with it, but there's something there that doesn't feel right. And it wasn't in the first. It does seem a little more formulaic than the first. You get one action scene after the next, even going as far as to copy the sandstorm from the first film and changing it slightly using water instead of sand.<br/><br/>It's a nice little film and most people should like it. Perhaps it's best to let the Mummy franchise die there. It will certainly save you from the very disappointing third instalment."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","7 October 2013"," A Worthy Sequel To The Mummy
","Making effective use of the very same ingredients that made its predecessor a surprise success, The Mummy Returns is a worthy follow-up to The Mummy that brings slight improvements in almost all filmmaking departments to provide its viewers another hell of a rollicking adventure that stays true to the original while also being more entertaining this time.<br/><br/>Set 10 years after the events of the first film, the story of The Mummy Returns brings back Rick & Evelyn O'Connell, along with their son Alex, against the High Priest Imhotep who has again risen from the dead but this time is looking for the Bracelet of Anubis in order to gain control of The Scorpion King's army, thus once again endangering the fate of all mankind.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Stephen Sommers who returns to the franchise he created with more action, humour & fun sequences and does a wonderful job at it. The premise is light-hearted as expected but the improvements are very much noticeable in visual effects, music, set pieces & few performances if not in writing which lack the freshness that the original had.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Mummy Returns is a welcome addition to The Mummy franchise that builds upon the foundation laid by the first chapter to succeed as another lively, cheerful & highly enjoyable extravaganza and does enough to satisfy most fans of the original. Once again not meant to be taken seriously, this adventurous sequel is almost as good as its predecessor, if not better."
"SanteeFats","8","1","1","6 July 2013"," Decent enough
","Not as well done as The Mummy but I still really liked it. Rick and Evy are now married with a child. They are living in London in a very nice house. The fight scenes when the bad guys break into the house are very well done. Their kid is taken during the fight. The kid is a major player in this movie. He is smart enough to leave clues for his parents who are following him. The graphics in this movie are just as good as in the first one. I love the little pygmy guardians that wake up when all the people invade the area. They are inspired and funny. The Scorpion King scenes are not even close to the movie that came later. That movie is a good one though."
"BrickNash","9","1","1","2 June 2013"," More of the same but the same great quality
","The sequel to the fantastic adventure that was The Mummy was always going to be a tough job. Thankfully the same cast and crew are reunited with writer/director Steven Somers taking the helm once again.<br/><br/>The good thing about this movie is that it doesn't try to top the original but what it does do is offer up more of the same. Same feel, same look, same humour and it all works nicely to bring a sequel that will keep you entertained for an hour or two.<br/><br/>It has to be said it's not 'quite' as good as the original. The story takes a strange turn in giving the characters some sort of mystical heritage which is a little odd but works nonetheless. The CGI is the usual standard for a film of this type but again I don't think it is quite as good as the first film.<br/><br/>All this is just nitpicking as the plot and story race along very well and all the actors do their parts and look like they are having fun especially the young O'Connell Alex who is a nice addition to the cast.<br/><br/>Nothing more can really be said, if you like me loved the first Mummy film then do not hesitate to watch this as it is simply an extension of the quality and will satisfactorily fill your 'more of the same' urge."
"calummatheson26","6","1","1","27 August 2012"," A step up !
","This film is rather old but I thought I would still throw in my opinion in case others haven't seen it. The first film was a great action packed thrill ride with a few horror elements thrown in. But that was just the start, this film comes along and smashes that one away. Production value was clearly increased, the incorporation of family problems was great, great settings, great plot/characters. However there is one thing I would like to pick up on, I don't like the fact that the Scorpion King was an actual scorpion, The animation of the face and body was badly done and I was waiting throughout the film to see an epic sword/fist fight at the end, but when I saw him, I was like ""oh..."" It would have been way better to put the Rock back in and when we saw him die at the start he was human.....anyway, a must see in my opinion :)"

Dad (Brendon Frazier), mom (Weisz) and son (Freddie Boath) all fight together to defeat Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo). There is even a kooky brother-in-law (John Hannah) - a real family adventure.<br/><br/>This is the second film for ""The Rock."" He was in ""Longshot,"" but way down on the billing as a mugger.

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","1","1","15 January 2012"," Missing Some Things
","After having The Mummy (1999) perform really well at the box office, Universal pictures decided that a sequel HAD to be made. So it was done, and this film plays nice and retains a lot of it's genuine feel but it seems like there are things that were sorely left out. In other words, things were given precedence over other things instead of the other way around. What seemed to get more attention was the aspect of special effects and the characters were left in the dust,...sand whatever. There are just too many scenes that contain so much CGI, that it's difficult for the viewer not to imagine seeing the actors onset with a blue screen surrounding them. <br/><br/>All main characters from the first movie are back in this film. Plus there's an add on. Rick O'Connell and Evelyn conceive a child named Alex. And of course to make the screenplay fun they make Alex an energetic brat that loves to be just as adventurous as his mother and father. Nothing like family genes to keep the entertainment high in this franchise. Rachel Weisz looks even more attractive in this film and she's not as klutzy as she was before, which is good for an undead vanquishing mother. Her brother Jonathan still learns nothing in this film and its funny to see him try and do things right and ends up failing. Nothing changes with his character that's for sure. <br/><br/>What's doesn't work is how the story involves so many ideas and concepts that it looks like this film could have maybe passed as the first film. Arnold Vosloo returns as Imhotep, the evil, life-absorbing mummy who cares for nothing except his girlfriend and himself. He didn't even care about his high priest that helped him get to where he had to go. Jerk! Adding to this though is a character called the Scorpion King played by Dwayne Johnson seems to take hold of the reigns in the finale of this film. Wasn't this film about Imhotep returning for his own needs? Well yes, but his focus is to gain control of the Scorpion King's army who is not yet destroyed, yada yada yada. So in a sense, no it's not really about him returning. Imhotep's in this film to create a race against the O'Connell family but he's not the important person the O'Connell's need to kill.<br/><br/>The special effects of this film really starts to overwhelm its characters when the end of the film approaches. The action sequences are still cool to watch but to see giant armies of dog headed zombies, massive forests surround a pyramid, and the Scorpion King himself is just not convincing enough to be real. I think director Stephen Sommers took a chance with that. Although this film was a success, I think they could have held off on the majority of the CGI. It was almost like Universal was saying, ""Look how much stuff we can cram into this 24 inch screen"",...seriously, you don't have to overload a film with CGI to make it look good. Just look at the first one, it's a perfect example.<br/><br/>The title of this film can be somewhat misleading due to the fact that Imhotep is in this film but is utilized only as another plot device. For the most part it keeps all the elements of the first movie the same, but sometimes CGI is all the audience looks at which doesn't make it anymore unrealistic than it already is."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6","1","1","30 December 2009"," He does return, and he brings nothing new with him
","More of the same. For anyone wondering, no, I don't like Indiana Jones either(though I've barely watched any; I do believe that I'd enjoy it, and I can't say that for this). You know, I really wish I could say something nice about Sommers. No, honestly. For as cathartic as it can be to unleash a verbal smack-down in these reviews, it is nothing compared to how satisfying it is to point to what a certain film-maker does that sets them apart from the rest. Be it an uncompromising vision, perfectionism, or, heck, simpler things such as them always making the viewer laugh, or being dependable to provide exciting pictures. But I can find no such thing about him. Well, to be accurate, nothing that is *positive*. The numerous holes that this(the *second flick*) creates in the continuity are one of the signs that he expects the audience to just ignore all of the inconsistencies, to not question the fiction we are served. While there are a couple of things that are kinda cool, and the occasional second here and there of the non-stop action that doesn't suck, everything is still ridiculously over the top. Can he please limit his crap to focusing on only one catastrophe at a time? The effects continue to be the real attraction(and they're already outdated), albeit this has less of people standing around to admire the aesthetic value of the source of the immediate danger that they are in. I don't know why they chose to cut corners with several of the FX, instead of figuring out a different way to do the sequence(it would be less obvious). Bits in this mirror the first, only here, it makes even less sense. Rick himself has a line about how convenient the plot is. Every character is obnoxious, and this adds an intolerable kid. I repeat the question: Who are we meant to care about? Emotion is invariably phoned in, mainly because of the tone. A handful of these performers can act, elsewhere... it is not a myth, I have seen it. A couple of them may make an effort here. Oded Fehr remains my favorite thing about these. The Rock has so little to do that you can barely be disappointed; it is worth noting, however, that, in this, his face often seems to indicate that the desert exudes an incredibly rank odor. Oh, wait, sorry... that's him trying to look bad-ass. This is powerfully unfunny, and a few moments are disgusting. When did Imhotep develop outright telekinesis? And why on Earth does he only use it sometimes? There is mild, if potentially disturbing, violence in this. Well, the mummies do, to an extent and every now and again, actually have the appearance they're supposed to. And this provides hot chicks(including showing them briefly half-naked) for us straight males to gawk at. I mean, I've never noticed before that Weisz is that sexy. Maybe this is the only time she's had cleavage so much in the space of two hours, and her legs featured prominently in as frequent shots as here. In ways(not all), this is not as awful as the original. I recommend this to any fans of that, and/or of cheesy adventure movies in general. 6/10"

","My Take: A ripping old-fashioned adventure with excessive special effects galore, but a lot of fun. <br/><br/>Sequels have always been a part in Hollywood entertainment, most especially summer blockbusters. What we have here is a sequel, once again, to a surprise blockbuster hit. The film was THE MUMMY, which became one of the biggest hits in 1999. With more than a million bucks for another movie, writer/director Stephen Sommers is back for THE MUMMY RETURNS, with bigger plans, bigger budget and, of course, bigger special effects.<br/><br/>THE MUMMY RETURNS has the usual trappings for a summer movie. Big special effects mainly. This one has more special effects than the first film. We get to see more than just mummies coming to life, or sand taking form of the large gaping face of a monster. This time, director (Sommers) brings out everything his imagination has brought up. The story seemed to be more than a decoration, rather than the special effects, which suddenly turn up as one of the films main target. It has special-effects over story and intelligence, but what do you expect from a summer action movie (a sequel, no less). I enjoyed THE MUMMY RETURNS, like all summer flicks, for what they are.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are back as Rick and Evy, who's out to defend the earth, once again, from the mummy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who is resurrected to fulfill a prophecy, to slay the legendary Scorpion King (played briefly by The Rock), and gain control of the Army of Anubis and gain full immortality.<br/><br/>The film has overtones of a horror story, but really is a big, bustling action movie. Obviously inspired by the INDIANA JONES series, like the first film, this film boasts a lot of daredevil action stunts, some totally unbelievable. A large suspension of disbelief is required, but the action sequences, as are the special effects, are so wildly exciting and silly (embracing the slight absurdity of a n old B-movie serial) that they are simply destined to please the eyes, and that's what they do, in spades.<br/><br/>Best of all, it's that great new summer action movie, yet it embraces elements from the past. Like the first movie, it ain't art, but it's a well-written strictly old-fashioned adventure, providing chills, action and a lot of laughs. Sommers and his crew truly understood what the original such a hit. It wasn't a brilliant piece of movie-making, and neither was it a realistic lesson in archeology. It was big-time fun. Though it needed the most skillful special effects money can buy, THE MUMMY RETURNS proves that the good old times of action adventures are not extinct. In a time when very few of these kind of movies are being made, it's nice to see one done right. (and if you ask me, that's everything a long-time fan of INDIANA JONES, like me, could ever ask for). I think THE MUMMY RETURNS is just as good as the original.<br/><br/>Sure it's a purely silly action-adventure of B-movie quality. Sure it aspires to be mocked. But that's just it, no matter how silly and overblown this movie is, it never forgets to laugh at itself and just have fun with it. <br/><br/>Rating: ****1/2 out of 5."

","Quite nice an action flick. Above all I shall remember Patricia Velasquez playing the bad girl of the movie.<br/><br/>Whatever you say she's brought charm and womanish values to be seen in a high B class movie. While jokes and action scenes are simple and easy to follow, the CGI is no one's step above for early 2000s, the actress's made one visual footprint to remember with her sex appeal. Too bad she's not around to entertain us any further.<br/><br/>The plot is simple and is not allowed to go on with all the discrepancies between faiths and manners.<br/><br/>One can expect more to hear in the soundtrack, it's no Jerry Goldsmith any more.

","The Mummy Returns (2001, Dir. Stephen Sommers) <br/><br/>Many years ago, in Ancient Egypt, the Scorpian Kind led a menacing army, but when he sold his soul to Anubis, he was erased from history. Now he is only a myth...or is he? Rick and Evelyn O'Connell is still discovering new artifacts, along with their 8 year old son Alex. They discover the Bracelet of Anubis. But someone else is after the bracelet. High Priest Imhotep has been brought back from the dead once again and wants the bracelet, to control the Scorpian King's army. That's not the only problem. Imhotep now has Alex and with the bracelet attached to him, doesn't have long to live.<br/><br/>It's hard to come across a good sequel, but 'The Mummy Returns' isn't that bad. It might feel as if it's missing the menace of the mummy in this film, but it's still a lot of fun. All the great characters are back with some hilarious lines, especially John Hannah as Jonathan. The effects are great just like the last film, and the action is there for everyone. Depending on what you like, there will be mixed opinions on which film is better.<br/><br/>""Oh, Not these guys again"" - Rick (Brendan Fraser)"

","This is a sequel that. amazingly, is every bit as good as the first movie. Again the returning cast is excellent, with the always added pleasure of Alun Armstrong as the museum curator, and THE ROCK as the scorpion king. (Historical side note: There are records of an early ruler of part of Egypt around the time of the first dynasty called the Scorpion King, who conquered a large area near what is today Luxor.) All of the great elements of the first feature are back with directing duties going once more to Stephen Sommers. If you liked the first film you are going to love this one. Pair it up with THE MUMMY (1999) and THE SCORPION KING for a delightful evening of fun and adventure."

","The Mummy returns, the sequel to the 1999 hit, surpasses its predecessor and is one of the best adventure movies of recent memory. The story involves a complicated set-up involving pro-wrestler The Rock, as the scorpion king, and the whole ""forbidden items which have curses"" of always.<br/><br/>The film starts out with an exciting battle sequence. We are then transported into 1932, where Evee and her husband have a mischievous little son, Alex. Nearly all characters (including Imhotep, of course) return this time around. After a fast temple-flooding sequence, we are thwarted between set pieces, which include a rampage in a double-decker bus through the streets of London, a house, museum and jungle fight, pygmy mummies, a giant mummy faced tidal wave and an exotic saber (which are actually Chinese) cat fight. The dialog is nothing deep, and the film makes fun of itself throughout. Although the effects are amazing, they are very digital, excessive and feel artificial. But the final conflict is breathtaking, as is the whole film."

I really enjoyed John Hannah's comedy sidekick in this movie who provided some funny scenes between the action packed sequences, also the Rock was well cast as the scorpion king. Where this film lacks over it's predecessor is in some very dodgy CGI and the addition of an irritating kid as a main character. Also as with all sequels it doesn't feel as fresh as the original. There are also a few cringe worthy scenes of father son bonding and some jokes that miss the mark by a mile.<br/><br/>7/10 - Good fun but feels padded out and not as fresh as the original."

If you don't like action packed movies, or bugs I would suggest that you don't watch this, but for every one else I would suggest it! The plot is written pretty well and they have great actors for the roles. The villains are really cool and they now have a kid who joins them on the adventure.

"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","1","1","2 September 2004"," Proof that films can be rushed and devalued
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Stephen Sommers obviously has a bit of a passion for classic Hammer Horror. This writer and director released the mediocre, adventure film ""Van Helsing"" in 2004, with it's main purpose being to unify the Wolf-Man, Frankenstein's monster and Dracula in one film. Before he would write and direct this film however, Sommer wrote and directed two films featuring that other Monster, The Mummy. In the second of these two films, 2001's ""The Mummy Returns"", Sommers has made an error in judgement. With a decent (albeit not perfect) script, Sommers could easily have improved upon the original movie. The flaw with this sequel though is that it never seems to know what it wants to be. One minute it is a modern action flick using ridiculous ammounts of realistic CGI (Anubis's Army being the best example) and the next minute it is a distinctively classic adventure style with painted backgrounds and weak special effects (the Scorpion King looking like something from a 1980s computer game).<br/><br/>In ""The Mummy Returns"" we are reunited with Rick and Evelyn O'Connell. Now happily set up in an English Mansion with a young son, the infuriating Alex, these two lovebirds are still obsessed with finding ancient tombs and destroying them. Evil is at work once again however, with ancient priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) resurrected and looking for the temple of the Scorpion King. Once more it is upto Rick, Evelyn and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah) to stop the evil priest and save the world from a bleak future.<br/><br/>Sommers' film has some really nice ideas. With some new characters supporting the original stars, there is enough originality to keep the series fresh. As well as this, there are suitable moments of enjoyment to keep the audience satisfied. The Pygmi Mummies in particular are a moment of enjoyment where these little monkey like creatures run around stabbing people in the jungle and getting themselves blown up. Sadly for Sommers however, ""The Mummy Returns"" is not as good as it should be.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is purely superficial. Whilst the plot remains well written and enjoyable, ""The Mummy Returns"" is ruined because the final few weeks of it's schedule were rushed. Rather than taking the time to put a bit extra money and effort into scenes involving the Scorpion King and minor set designs, it was rushed and the result is one or two scenes where the actors walk infront of a cardboard cut-out and a Scorpion King who looks ridiculously artificial. It's a huge shame that this has happened really. The original film from 1999, and the first hour or so of this sequel, are both brilliant, enjoyable features. With the ending being rushed however, the series looses a lot of respect.<br/><br/>""The Mummy Returns"" had a lot of potential. With a well written script by Sommers, and acceptable direction by Sommers as well, it had promise. Adding to this, a superb cast who obviously had fun during filming, and the film looks like it would be a huge hit. Ultimately though, this film flops badly because Sommers and the rest of the staff were bullied into releasing the film on a certain date. Whilst an extra month of work might have originally stunted it's box-office success, this extra time would have ultimately made the film better than it ended up being. As a result, rather than Sommers having a film which would be absolutely brilliant, he has finished with a middle of the range cinema experience which might have decent substance, but visually is a mess. An enourmous disappointment."
"TheOtherFool","7","1","1","4 May 2004"," I actually liked it
","Good old-fashioned adventure no-brainer works perfect just like that, as The Mummy Returns provides loads of fun.<br/><br/>Our two heroes from the first Mummy (Brendan Fraser and lovely Rachel Weisz) are now married and have an eight year old son. He's a bit of a brat, and apparently his parents think alike as they don't hesitate to make out while he is kidnapped by some scary mummy type guys.<br/><br/>The story makes no sense of course (and sometimes is a bit hard to follow), but the special effects truly are amazing and comic relief by John Hannah as Weisz's sister is very funny. <br/><br/>I'd say it's better than the first one, 7/10."

","First of all, I'm not very impartial because I am a great fan of the director of this movie, Stephen Sommers. All the expectations I had were completely fulfilled. This movie has got everything that I want to see in a movie of this kind and from this director: plenty of great, well - performed action underlined by a perfect sense of entertaining humor in combination with a bit of love and drama (fortunately not too much of it). The action continues without ever stopping and totally entertains you in the course of the 130 minutes. Stephen Sommers surpasses himself with each movie he makes and I'm already looking forward to watching `Van Helsing' which is also written AND directed by Sommers. In my opinion his name has to be mentioned at one stroke along with other great action - directors like John McTiernan, John Woo, Renny Harlin, Wolfgang Petersen, Michael Bay and James Cameron. Stephen, if you ever read this: You're one of the best! This movie gets 9 out of 10!"

Fraser and Weisz, now married with child, get caught up in a plot to conquer the world (what else?) involving their old friend Imotep and a new baddie, the Scorpion King, played by cult fave The Rock. If you look at it as a cartoon strip it's easier to take - while much of the dialogue and almost all of the plot are beyond mindless, the special effects and main characters are almost uniformly appealing. Weisz handles her expanded action role very nicely while doing repeated battle with a stunning Velazquez, who also gets a lot more air time. A reserved thumbs-up."
"morgana-6","7","1","1","8 July 2002"," Fun fantasy
","I watched my videotape last night with a friend who hadn't seen it (but had seen The Scorpion King, which I hadn't). I was struck again by how much fun is in these two movies. They strike a delightful blend of humor and action. The plot in this one is a bit muddled (don't try to figure out the timeline), but the first time through you just don't notice. If you liked the good guys in the first flick, there is more of them, especially Ardeth Bey and the Mehji. If you liked the sexy mummy, there's more of him too: and you almost feel sorry for him at the end. And then there's the Rock, who lived up to his name. He has just about as much acting ability as his name (which is the main reason I avoided The Scorpion King). I gather wrestling fans were disappointed with how little he was in the film: I was grateful. And I mustn't forget to mention the son of Evie and Rick O'Connell. Normally, I abhor films and tv shows that add children, but this one has all the feisty fearlessness of both of his parents, keeps his head under fire, while keeping the ability of all children to get into trouble. He reminds me of the children/young adults in the Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and that's a compliment. Overall, if you enjoyed the first movie, there's lots you'll like in this sequel. I'd like to see more of them, even without the mummy!"
"Victor Field","7","1","1","5 July 2002"," Stephen Sommers isn't Steven Spielberg, but at least he isn't Jan deBont.
","Jan deBont started out great, directing-wise, with ""Speed,"" and he hasn't made a decent movie since. Stephen Sommers hasn't reached the heights of ""Speed,"" but he hasn't plumbed the depths of ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" either - he makes big dumb movies, for sure, but at least he makes entertaining big dumb movies. Think of him as the American equivalent of Roland Emmerich if Emmerich hadn't shot his bolt after ""Independence Day"" (""Deep Rising"" is everything ""Godzilla"" should have been).<br/><br/>""The Mummy Returns,"" the silly but fun sequel to the silly but fun ""The Mummy,"" actually improves on the original in a few aspects, most notably in that Rachel Weisz's Evy has a bit more dimension to her this time with the clumsiness that was a running gag in the first movie passed on as an afterthought to her and Rick's (Brendan Fraser) son; but the story of our heroes having to prevent the unearthed Mummy and his reincarnated love (the fetching Patricia Valezquez) from killing the Scorpion King and using his army to take over the world, all the while racing to keep their son from dying himself, is more than a little flawed in its scripting - where did the new Anck-su-Namun come from, for instance? - and some moments leave a bad taste in the mouth (are we really supposed to laugh at the scene where a hapless underling gets killed by a pygmy and John Hannah's character says ""Sorry!""?).<br/><br/>Our heroes' son (played by Spencer Treat Clark, who I honestly thought was a girl in ""Gladiator"" and didn't impress me here either) is another drawback, with attempts to weld his mother's Britishness and his father's wiseacre nature never quite working; and the special effects are uneven, varying from horribly obvious (like the opening battle and the raising of the dead army in the climax) to quite good (like the pygmies and the abyss) - since five effects companies are listed, it's unlikely that Industrial Light and Magic are to blame for all the flaws (and they are definitely credited for the pygmy work). <br/><br/>But the movie benefits from action to spare, from its spirited cast (even the Rock in his - let's be honest - cameo as the Scorpion King), and also from Alan Silvestri's excellent score. (A big order of the carnivorous bugs that eat at least one member of the cast should, however, go to whoever put that ghastly song ""Forever May Not Be Long Enough"" over the end credits - the most obvious tack-on pop number since Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart and Sting got together for the tune at the end of the '93 version of ""The Three Musketeers."") Mentally stimulating it's not, but it's not boring by any stretch of the imagination. And when will you ever see another film with a credit for ""Mountain Of Flesh""?"

(small spoiler, if you haven't seen the website or one of a few other places that had this written) Having Rick and Evelyn married with a son was great, it allowed the movie to show how they had matured while still staying the same. (I hadn't seen that written anywhere, but my mom told me this morning that she already knew about it, even though she hadn't seen the movie.) It was really good over all, but I felt they could have done more explaining of the Scorpion King's character, but then that's what they're making a third movie for, so I guess that part is ok after all."

The much-hyped appearance of The Rock (Dwayne Johnson to those who don't recognize him from the WWF) does not exactly dominate the movie as one would expect, but when his character, the Scorpion King, does lend a nice presence to the film.  As this is his silver screen debut, I was expecting sub-par acting, only to find he actually did the job quite nicely. Brendan Fraser reprises his starring role, supported by Rachel Weisz, Oded Fehr, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, who were all in the first movie.  More of the movie is dedicated to the underlying story from ""The Mummy,"" which helps to somewhat improve the first movie in a post mortem kind of way. The special effects are greatly enhanced from the original, but there are also some completely new effects that lend the movie a great supernatural flair. All in all, this movie is, well, stellar."

"BobTop","8","1","1","4 May 2001"," A worthy sequel
","This is a movie I have been waiting to see since the first movie.  I thought that the story was fairly well written, and thought that a sequel, if well done, would be great fun.<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed.  The movie takes up 10 years after the events in the first movie; Rick and Evie are married and have a son, Alex, and are living in London when they're not on digs in Egypt.  Now that the Bembridge Scholars have come to their senses, Evie is working at the British Museum, and has begun to have strange dreams and waking visions of her in ancient Egypt.<br/><br/>Enter Imhotep, newly resurrected by his followers, who is going to rule the Army of Anubis and take over the world.  Anksunamun is also there, in the flesh, to help Imhotep on his mission.  His mission is to defeat The Scorpion King, the ancient leader of the Army of Anubis, played by The Rock. Lots of action, fighting, mummies running up walls and golden pyramids later, our heroes prevail (as if you expected otherwise?)<br/><br/>The story runs pretty smoothly throughout and the acting is pretty good, at least as good as the first movie.  I wasn't expecting Oscar nominations out of this movie.  If you are, wait until it comes out on video and save a couple of bucks for your disappointment.  The special effects were OK, too, though a lot of them were rehashes from the first one (wall of water instead of sand, Imhotep absorbing the souls of his victims to gain strength, mummies running on the walls, scarabs coming out of the sand, etc.)  The most annoying part of the movie, which I had problems getting past, was the very poor quality of the computer-generated graphics involving The Scorpion King in the last bit of the movie.  Given the high quality of the rest of the CGI, from the recreations of Carnac to the Army of Anubis to Imhotep-in-tatters, this was very difficult not to notice. <br/><br/>Overall, a good adventure flick with a couple of good laughs thrown in, this should be on a par with the original Mummy in terms of success and viewability.  Will I be waiting for The Mummy 3 based on it?  Sure will!!"
"supa-2","8","1","1","2 May 2001"," Blows the first one away...
","Before getting into my ""comments"", I'd just like to say that I loathed ""The Mummy"" for one reason--the mummy looked absolutely ridiculous.  The (in my opinion) terrible CGI look of Imhotep took me out of the movie.  ""The Mummy Returns"" is plagued with a similar problem, but because the good far outweighs the bad, I can forgive them (I'll discuss this at the end--beware it contains SPOILERS).<br/><br/>""The Mummy Returns"" picks up 8 years after the previous film.  Although the characters haven't physically aged, their on-screen chemistry (mainly between Fraser and Weisz) has improved.  Thrown into the mix is an 8-year old named Alex (Freddie Boath) who shows the world that children *can* act, a warrior/guide (reprised by Oded Fehr), the bumbling brother (John Hannah), and an airship pilot (actor unknown).  All together this group makes a likeable team off to save the world (again)from two threats--the resurrected Imhotep and also resurrected Scorpion King (lots of resurrection in this flick).  The movie is paced very well with plenty of action, battle scenes, and one on one fighting as well as some slower travelling scenes and romantic moments.  It seems like the writer/director (Stephen Sommers) followed a number of conventions popularized by recent hits (""Gladiator""/""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" weapon fights, ""The Matrix"" like one on one fights, ""Braveheart"" like battles, and ""The Phantom Menace"" like CGI characters). The result pays off.  The action is peppered with one-liners and hilarious sight gags (The pygmies are fantastic and reminiscent of ""Gremlins"").  It's nice that the film doesn't take itself too seriously.  The DTS sound in the film is some of the best ever--it will be nominated for best sound.  The film would have been the perfect ""popcorn"" flick (although I despise people that eat in theaters) except for one huge flaw:  BIG SPOILER  At the end of the film, Fraser faces off with the resurrected Scorpion King.  Rather than using the Rock for the finale, the Scorpion King takes the form of a giant scorpion with a CG model of the Rock's head.  Unfortunately, the result is less than spectacular--it blows.  All of the other CGI creatures are fantastic (Imhotep's eyes are some of the best ever seen on a CGI creature). The scorpion monster looks unfinished--It's as if they made some sort of CG mockup for test audiences and said ""We'll finish that guy up later"", but then they forgot to.  It just goes to show that we're years away from being able to CG model a human actor. I would have preferred either a giant scorpion (minus the Rock's head) or just the Rock himself.  But overall, the film was good--it was a case of my low expectations being exceeded, and that's always a good feeling."
"Rhino Rover","8","1","1","7 May 2001"," Action packed but...
","I'm starting to see a trend in the new action/adventure movies and it may not be for the better. CGI (Computer Generated Images) is becoming one of the primary tools of many filmmakers but is it coming at a cost? We began to see CGI come into movies quite a few years ago but they were usually as enhancements to the story or to the set. Now CGI is becoming more prominent and taking a center stage role. The Mummy Returns is a very good example of this.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns is a sequel to the very popular The Mummy that came out in 1999. The story basically takes place several years later after our hero, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evie Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) have gotten married and have a young son (Freddie Boath). The couple are still the adventurous archeologists they were in the first movie but now they have a young son to take with them on their adventures. This story revolves around the resurrection of our arch villain, Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), but with a slight twist. This time around he's to kill the Scorpion King (The Rock) that will be making a reappearance after 5000 years to take over the world. But as noble as that sounds, his motives are less than desirable.<br/><br/>
Was I entertained? Yes, definitely BUT, this was a case of too much CGI. The blending of reality and fantasy together with CGI can be a tricky thing, especially when the two worlds meet. The audience whether consciously or not, will instinctively pick up on things when they are unable to identify with it. In this movie, we see many instances where the two worlds meet and quite a few times, my eye was attracted to something that didn't move naturally. Unlike the movie, Matrix, where we were basically told to suspend all beliefs about the law of physics and such, this movie incorporated characters that behaved human-like yet movements and detail gave them away. Mind you, I do not often see walking wolf-like creatures but their mannerism and general body shape was humanoid so the natural instinct was to identify with what you know and in too many cases, it didn't look right to the eye. The decision to generate a complete CGI of the Scorpion King at the end of the movie I thought was a big error. The looks were too cartoonish and resembled something you see on Saturday morning cartoons. It was too distracting and took away from the events at the time.<br/><br/>However, I really enjoyed the fight sequences between the female leads (Weisz and Velazquez). They were quick and well choreographed. It's refreshing to see that directors are not afraid to show female leads as strong characters that are just as capable to fight as their male counter-parts. Fraser and Weisz played their parts well and like the last movie, Oded Fehr is outstanding. The Rock however is something else. In his movie debut, I found his performance a little bit extreme and probably not too far from his wrestling persona. Whether this will be the beginning of a film career or not, I cannot tell but hopefully his acting improves.<br/><br/>
Overall, this was a very entertaining movie to kick off the summer. It was full of action and fast paced but I've seen much better computer graphics in other movies."

The special effects are a step up from the first, and the story is almost as good.

The O' Connors are left with fighting off Imhotep and a bunch of other various creations and enemies.<br/><br/>The view:The plot sounds action packed, and it is. The action scenes are brilliantly put together and the entertainment is put in the film from start to finish. The problem is that the film relies on computers far to much to bring some action scenes to life and it comes to a point when the viewer can't take any more of it and the enjoyment stops there, and when the ending has come along the scenes have tired the viewer out making you want to hate some of the way it was made. ***"

","This movie promised great things, and delivered quite a few of them. From the beginning, the pace of the movie kept you enthralled- if a little exhausted, with the impressively shot fight scenes, the dazzling special effects (best viewed at the cinema for a more 'awe-inspiring' result), the great chemistry between the two leads (Rachel Weisz and Brendan Frasier as the 'O'Connells') and the perfomances of such scene stealers as Freddie Boath as the mischievous, accident-prone son of the O'Connell's, Patricia Velazquez as the reincarnation of Anak-su-namun, and the intense screen-presence of Arnold Vosloo as the infamous Imhotep. However, as a fan of the first movie, I found certain aspects of the plot a little hard to accept and if I may dare to say- far fetched, despite the fact that the movie admittedly and thankfully does not take itself seriously. This included, without giving too much away, the whole Evie and Rick reincarnation business *cue flesh-revealing flashbacks* Diehard fans of the first movie will find one particular aspect of the plot distressing, again without giving too much away, let me just say this: Wasn't Imhotep the man with whom Anak-su-namun possessed an eternal bond? The man for whom she was willing to sacrifice herself to be with in the first movie? The same man she shared half the first movie with in dealing with their everlasting devotion? I'll say no more."

It is fabulous from start to finish - especially the scenes in London, featuring Tower Bridge and the British Museum as you've never seen them before!  The little mummies are superb as they scuttle along buildings, and there are also some thrilling chase sequences through the forests!<br/><br/>All acting is first-rate in this film - Brendan Fraser I find just the most likeable hero, Rachel Weisz looks even more stunning, Patricia Velasquez is perfectly bitchy, John Hannah is again the typical English clown, and Arnold Vosloo adds another dimension to the character of Imhotep - I even felt sorry for the guy in this film!  And how could I forget Freddie Boath, who does an excellent job as an amusing though stereotypical boy-scout-type kid. Also look out for a scene-stealing turn from the airship-pilot, but the star of the show just has to be Horus, the kestrel!<br/><br/>The special effects perhaps vary in this film, from breathtakingly-brilliant to downright pathetic.  I particularly found the scenes in the airship, flying through the sky, very dodgy - surely that's a cardboard cut-out in the background?!<br/><br/>But did I mention the music?  This film has a fantastic soundtrack, which I made sure to buy, and adds even more merit to a remarkable adventure.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give this film at least 7/10 for pure entertainment value - it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it rivals the likes of 'Star Wars' as the best popcorn movie ever!"

Of course it dosent hurt that there is a fantastic cast including Brendan Fraiser (and despite what any one might say about his previous films, Brendan's acting is fantastic) and the stunningly beautiful (and extremly talented) Rachel Weisz. Not only doese the Mummy Returns have woulderfull specal effects and non-stop action sequances, but it also has a (supprisingly) good plot.

","That is probably my subjective opinion, since I have the first part and must`ve watched it a dozen times by now. This sequel has everything it should have - great special effects (except for the Scorpion King in the end, it was painfully obvious that it was an animation), great music, great scenery, A LOT of action and some funny scenes...but the characters and their lines are not as amusing as they used to be in the first part and there are some seriously pathetic moments. Not to mention some confusing things in the plotline. For instance, Meela can`t be resurrected Anck-su-namun because someone had to resurrect her and there isn`t anyone who could do that except Imhotep, who is not brought back to life yet. And if she`s a reincarnation (definition - reincarnation is a rebirth of a soul in a new human body - and as far as I know that should happen at birth), then her soul is already reborn so it couldn`t have been in the Underworld when Imhotep brought her back to life in ""The Mummy"". See what I mean?<br/><br/>I won`t even discuss how come that Imhotep didn`t recognize Evie as Nefertiri. I didn`t like all this thing about reincarnation - everyone turned out to be some ancient Egyptian something.<br/><br/>Plus - I absolutely hated the the ending of Imhotep`s and Anck-su-namun`s love. It wasn`t just a disgrace, it was a desecration that undermined the very existence of ""The Mummy"". We didn`t need that.<br/><br/>7/10 so far, maybe I change my mind after watching it again."

The rock's acting is so useless on the opening shot when he screams some sort of battle cry (""AKU MACENTAY"") you neerly wanna run out of the cinema crying. Then once the Scorpion King makes a deal with the Rock to have his soul, the rock is not seen till the end of the movie, in which he returns as a 10ft Scorpion which looks like something of Resident Evil, and trust me its not only the same sort of thing, it looks the same, the graphics on that shot are, a bad word.<br/><br/>Apart from that this movie was a crack, a real storm, you really do get you're money worth."

","It starts off very well and for the most part, this movie moves along at a very decent pace ALMOST the whole time. Velasques is a intriguing villainess and Weisz charming as heroine. They have also supplied this movie with a lot (and I do mean A LOT) of computer-animated images. Most of them are very impressive (like the wall of water in a ravine), but some fall flat and look fake. A reviewer referred to this movie as ""Brendan and the 101 computer-images"" and it's a fairly accurate description. It's a good, almost old-fashioned, matinee-movie where only a few images may be unsettling for a minor. However, I got a slightly dizzy feeling watching this. In a sequel you always know that they are going to do something more spectacular according to the ""bigger is better""-philosophy. And here they have thrown in almost everything imaginable and after a while I found myself saying ""oh, please. Not that too!"". The balloon-ships arrival was such a case. They should have cut some things out and left a more tightwoven plot, because I found the film just a bit too long. Otherwise I have nothing bad to say about this. All this movie wants is to entertain and that it does! The actors do their job fairly well, but take a back-seat to all the spectacular images and effects. I liked the first movie better, but as sequels go this is not a bad one."

I saw 'The Mummy' and enjoyed it, even though it was horribly inaccurate about Egypt (ancient and modern).  This film just took 'The Mummy' and did it over again.  Many of the special effects, although exciting, had been used in the first film.  It's as if the production team decided to use them over again to save money.  The dialogue was sometimes unintentionally funny, the acting was mediocre at best and there didn't seem to be an original idea in the whole film.  Not a film I'll be adding to my video collection when it comes out!"
"Dominion War","Null","1","1","14 July 2001"," Truly better than its predecessor
","Honestly, it escapes me why so many people have a problem with this film. What's up? Yes, we have a film without a great deal of originality, yes, the plot is predictable, and yes, there is hardly if any character depth. So what?? ""The Mummy Returns"" is a light-hearted shot at Indiana Jones meant to appeal to virtually all ages, are people truly expecting to watch this film and receive a thought-provoking Shakespearean performance?<br/><br/>What we do get, however, is a highly enjoyable thrill ride that has non-stop action and adventure from the very first scene. For what its genre is meant to be, this film is well-acted and gives a good show, and believe me, I know a terrible performance when I see it. The special effects are absolutely incredible and the stunts are something else. To let you know how much of an achievement this movie really is, I left a movie theatre in 1999 having just watched ""The Mummy"" with a mildly-impressed attitude towards it. Having viewed its sequel, I can honestly say it not only lives up to its original, but is actually a hell of a lot better.<br/><br/>*MILD SPOILERS AHEAD*<br/><br/>No doubt my favourite sequence was 1933 London, the stormy weather really giving an effectively sinister mood. This is where, in my humble opinion, the action really begins. After a nasty run in with the bad guys resulting in Rick O' Connel pursuing his kidnapped wife Evelyn, a newly-resurrected Imhotep sends his mummified priests after our heroes.<br/><br/>The O' Connels make their escape in a double decker bus (don't ask) which results in THE best chase scene ever! I won't give too much away, but for me, this WAS the movie. The film really ended for me the moment the bus-chase ended (but don't listen to me, this is only the beginning of the action).<br/><br/>My only problem with this movie is the way in which CGI effects are badly distinct at the film's climax as they are used to portray the Scorpion King. I can only guess that so much budget was used to create the rest of the film that not much was left for the most important part!<br/><br/>But anyway, to conclude: if you want a thought-provoking, philosophical, deep and intelligent movie where the characters are in depth, go and watch a Shakespearean play. If you're looking for a great adventure flick with brilliant special effects and a more-than-sufficiently-entertaining performance, then ""The Mummy Returns"" is for you."

I didn't like the first Mummy, so hoped this Sequel would better it - and it did, C.G.I wise! But the story is so lame, boring and cliche-ridden one must have all brain cells surgically removed (or maybe the whole brain!), or try not to think (and confuse oneself) about the events of the first movie.<br/><br/>WARNING! MUMMIFIED SPOILERS!<br/><br/>The plot revolves around our two main characters, she being the reincarnation of an Egyptian pharoah's daughter and he being the Saviour of the world (say what??).  This is pretty hard to grasp unless you suspend all disbelief. Question: How come Imhotep (the Mummy guy) doesn't recognize her in the first movie??<br/><br/>There is so much action scenes they become boringly tedious and the sound (which was cranked up to max in my theater) was absolutely hideous. To hear stuff scream (and there is a LOT of stuff screaming in this flick) at 200 decibels is rather pain-inducing. The anubis army charging over the sand dunes in their thousands is too much like the droid armies in Star Wars T.P.M. We also borrow ideas from Indiana Jones, but this doesn't 'make it', because the overuse of fake C.G.I is SO obviously fake.<br/><br/>Hollywood End Acts are becoming mandatory these days.  We have the just-escaped-by-the-skin-of-the-teeth-from-certain-death scene. Not once, but several times!  We are even subjected to the good-guy-dies-but-is-brought-back-to-life cliche.

The jokes were, at times, a little thin and came just short of waggling the eyebrows to highlight a punchline. If a thrill-a-minute movie is what you are after then this is a movie that should be high on your list of must-sees but I do tend to prefer a movie with a little more substance.

When such attempts are made, they are outright laughable. At times, early in this picture, the breakneck pace, absurdly wafer-thin awestruck dialogue and farcical bouts of violence, do amuse in an admittedly mindless way, but as the movie progresses, such hilarity (presumably unintentional for the most part) is harder and harder to find. It frankly descends into what is literally a barrage of pointless, scampering special effects-endowed images. The characters are scant, of course, with the actors probably better, but failing to truly rise above the material. The best that can be said about the child actor is that he is less inappropriate than the one in ""Enemy at the Gates"". Fraser, and certainly Weisz fail to truly characterize. Fraser is tolerable, and at times comically adept, but presumably is wasted in this film. John Hannah is relatively effective in the film's context, but the character is rather a tired stereotype. The least said about plot and script the better. Oh, and The Rock? A pointless appearance in keeping with the arbitrary ""qualities"" of the film.

"Nedla24","8","1","1","5 May 2001"," lighten up!!!
","I have been reading the abysmal reviews this movie is getting with amazement.  Since when did swashbuckling fun have to be high art?  I am convinced that Stephen Somers did something evil in a past life to deserve such a poor reception.  The original received a similar critical response which is what kept me from it.  Then when I viewed it recentley, I wondered if I had seen the same movie these critics had thrashed.  Luckily the public didn't buy it, and it doesn't look like they're scared away this time.  I thought for the moviegoer that might be a bit scared, I would like do address some of the critics complaints<br/><br/>1. The plot is too convoluted: This is not a particularly hard plot to follow, though it has many twists.  while it is not a masterful work of logic that keeps you guessing, it gives the movie many venues for it's great action sequences.  The back story of the Mummy is actually quite sad and touching, and if you are willing to just let it wash over you and not over-analyze, then you will find it quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>2. It rips off from nearly every movie ever made: This has a bit more merit, but still is misunderstood.  The movie makes many homages to adventure movies including Braveheart, The Lost World, Gladiator, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and all of the Indiana Jones movies.  The large battle sequences echo Braveheart when two charging armies collide in a crunching of steel, wood, and flesh.  But come on Mel, what did you expect?  That shot is waaaay too cool to be in just one movie.  The Crouching Tiger references are the new pet Falcon of Oded Fehr's character, and the multi-weapon girlfights between Rachel Weisz and Patricia Velasquez.  These are subtle at best. There is one scene which almost criminally rips off the tall grass raptor scene in the Lost World.  however it improves upon it.  Unlike the lost world, there are two opposing groups walking through the tall grass with the hidden nasties in it, trying to find each other, one character is trying to find another that has been taken captive, two adversaries are sword deuling, and two snipers are trying to help their friends.... you get the idea.  it improves upon the scene by adding elements and handling it well.<br/><br/>3. it is mindless: it is not.  it is actually quite intelligent as is the original.  it takes time to poke fun at itself.  it never loses the sense that the audience KNOWS that none of this could happen and is able to appeal to that sense.  <br/><br/>4. Brendan Fraser is not an action hero - I couldn't disagree more.  Action hero's don't have to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone to be believable.  Fraser channels a mix between two of the best action heroes around; Harrison Ford and Bruce Willis.  He has Ford's sense of dignity and believable heroism mixed with Willis's dry sense of humor.  Also I guarantee you that Brendan Fraser is in much better physical shape than either of the two ever were.  <br/><br/>so there it is.  It's a great popcorn popper, and no matter what the critics say, I can almost guarantee you will leave the theatre with a smile on your face."

","the movie was as i'd expected. as usual sequals often depend less on storyline and more on things like action, humor and special effects. not that a storyline is always very important (i think it's often overrated very much), but the mystiqe of the first movie simply wasn't there anymore. the two most irritating things in the movie were probably the ""return"" of the scorpion king as a scorpion (i'd rather like to see him as a man) and most of all the fact that imhotep's girlfriend abandoned him at the end. but then again, here i'm almost making the same big mistake as most filmcritics do: checking storyline. who cares in a movie like this? o.k. the story isn't all that, and there are quite some mistakes, unlike the first movie, but sowhat? it is a great fun movie to watch and THAT'S what it's all about! period!."

","""The Mummy Returns"" plays like a film made in the forties when Universal produced four sequels to the original ""The Mummy"" (1932). Though I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I think most classic monster fans will, it may seem out of place to today's more ""sophisticated and enlightened"" movie crowd.<br/><br/>The movie's all about fun and high-adventure and it delivers in spades on both! It contains all of the excitement, thrills and intrigue that can be found in the adventure serials of the thirties and forties.  Whether intentional or not, the CGI creature effects hearkened back to the days of Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen. Though much smoother than their stop-motion techniques, there was an obvious separation between the computer world and the real world. This added a kitschy feel to the film which I loved. When this movie is released for home viewing, I plan on watching it in black and white to get the complete 1940's feel!<br/><br/>The bottom line: If you go to the theatre to be entertained and to escape the real world, go see ""The Mummy Returns"", the kid inside you will thank you for it!"

And let's face it -- isn't that what most of us enjoy about movies in the first place?<br/><br/>All the lead players are back and they all do a fine job.  Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz make quite an adorable couple.  Unfortunately, John Hannah really is not a major player in this film, which is rather sad.

","They usually say sequels to movies can be pretty lame, but ""The Mummy Returns"" blew that right into the water. I thought this movie was creative and alot of fun, and the computer special effects were not too much at all. Truthfully if the movie didn't have the special effects well it really wouldn't make any of it believable now, would it ?! Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz do a great job of reprising the eternal love between Rick and Evie, Freddie Boath did a great job as Alex and his character did seem to be a stronger combination of and than his parents. You have to love John Hannah as Jonathan, he's such a sweetie and him being a clutz is just hilarious. Oded Fahr was kewl as Ardeth Bay, he really get's into his role and  I hope to see him in further roles in Hollywood, I loved his character. It was sad to see Imhotep crying when Anaksahamun betray him like that, making him realise that there love wasn't true and that the term eternal love belonged to Rick and Evie. I thought it was excellent and wouldn't mind seeing it again !!"
"PatrynXX","8","1","1","13 May 2001"," Fun to watch, but isn't that much original.
","This movie was a slight bit of a let down.  However it was a good sequel to the first Mummy.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS possible)<br/><br/>minuses Biggest problem is it's homage to the first movie.  Meaning the stupid lets parody the first movie.  Both  Beastmaster and Scream love to do that.  But I think it ruin's some of the fun in this movie.  Whereas it may have been fun (and still is) in the first movie.  This movie it's like, quit wasting are time already. There's also some question in the script writer when O'Connell says this line as they see Imhotep being raised from the dead.  (or something like that) ""You know, if I saw that a couple of years ago, I wouldn't have believed it.""  For some reason I believe 9 some years past.  That couldn't possibly a couple of years.  Oh sure a couple of years ago in our time sure, but it ain't 9 years. O'Connell pretty much is funny as usual. Anck Su Namun is a little more of a b**ch in this movie.  I liked her in the first. Oh mr Mummy/Imhotep is still the victim, tho more of Anck Su Namun than anybody else as she leaves him to die.  Nevermind herself. The Rock is a publicity stunt for the movie The Scorpion King.  He's like barely in here, says less lines than Arnold did in Terminator and was only on for less than 4 min.  Unless you count that crude computer designed Rock-Scorpion creature at the end. And while I still love Evelin, she's become fun loving librarian to miss wonder-bra woman who can kick butt.  Of the two if I'd first seen her, I'd take Miss Librarian any day.  Simply because I love books. And the movie has a little of that rushed lets push the director to get this done feel to it.  (Whats it about May??? anyway?)<br/><br/>Now the plusses. Believe me the plusses far outweight the minnuses.  If I've misspelled anything, it's only in rush btw. ;) It's the damn action that got me.  I loved it.  I loved seeing mummies in London.  That was my favourite part.  That Imhotep (Arnold Voosloo) had more screen time.  (Hmmm  great two arnolds in the same review.. oopsy) Some of the movie gets more of that Indiana Jones feel. (not the dog) If you like big grand scene's, you'll love it.  And the little one just has a field day now doesn't he.<br/><br/>In the end,  I like the first movie better.  It had a good mix of action and humor.  It's only fault was too much humor. Mummy Returns was the exact opposite.  In that it had too much action to humor mix.  I just hope that on Mummy 3  (not Scorpion King) and if there is one, that they finally find a good formula for this.<br/><br/>Cause it was the most fun I've had since Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>(new thing I'm trying.  Quality is what I believe is how good the movie is not how much I like it.  Which is what I've always done with movies. and Watchable or replay value is a side note.  If I had to see this movie again and again... would I.  Oh so very yes. Explained: Quality-7/10 Watchable- 10/10"

","After all the hoopla surrounding The Mummy Returns I had to go and see it. The original Mummy was a pleasant surprise and the sequel looked promising. I must say that I was entertained throughout the movie but there were some problems with it as well. I was not impressed with the matte paintings used for the backdrops as they were obvious and not well done. The special effects as well lacked quality and at times I could not believe this motion picture was a result of 21st Century movie making. All in all I think Universal rushed to get this picture made and it seems cut corners to get it out to theatres. Even with these problems I enjoyed the film. Some of the script was rather corny but again I think it is expected. I also did not really like the actor cast as the son. All in all though it was an entertaining film and at times the scenery was breath taking. The movie contains all sorts of action and thrill sequences. Approach the film with an open mind and prepare to expect an entertaining two hours of Mummy mayhem."

","`The Mummy Returns"" suffers from heavy-handed thievery.  It's probably a terrific movie if you've never seen any other movies before in your life, or if you've been living in a cave for the past twenty-five years, but if you don't meet the above criteria, then you're in for a bland, shameless rehash of a dozen other action movies that are better than `The Mummy Returns'. Combine this with a rather dull story and shoddy CGI effects, and you've got the first forgettable, must-miss blockbuster of 2001.<br/><br/>Ten years after the events of `The Mummy' ended (`The Mummy', incidentally, was a fun, much superior film to this dreck), we find erstwhile adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Frasier) married to his tempestuous love Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), living in London and leading relatively normal lives.  (The fact that such characters could ever contemplate living normal lives is possibly the only original part of the film.) However, fate and a heavy-handed script conspire to bring the body of the Mummy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) to the British Museum.  Once again, the Mummy Imhotep awakens, determined to live again and bring about the destruction of the world. Only Rick, Evelyn, and their 9-year old son Alex (Freddie Boath) can defeat the Mummy and save the world for impending doom.  Blah, blah, blah.<br/><br/>`The Mummy Returns' is wall-to-wall action, but that's probably due to necessity, since the movie doesn't have anything to say.  Action can be fun in its own right, but great action usually at least has a semblance of a story as its backbone, and `The Mummy Returns' usually has nothing.  When it does have something to say, it's cribbed straight out of `Indiana Jones'. Or `Romancing the Stone'. Or occasionally, when it's feeling ambitious, it stretches back to steal from Errol Flynn classics such as `Captain Blood'. There's no new twists in `The Mummy Returns', nothing that hasn't already been seen in a hundred other actions movies before . . . and definitely nothing that hasn't already been seen in its infinitely better predecessor, `The Mummy'.  Yes, some of the fight scenes are spectacular  a flashback fight between Evelyn and the Egyptian princess Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velasquez) is particularly outstanding  and the action makes for some over-the-top fun; but after awhile, it's simply gratuitous, mildly exciting filler.  (And the CGI work is uneven  while it's probably fun for the programmers to dream this cutting-edge stuff up, it still looks jarringly fake.) It's fun, even dumb fun, but dumb fun has been done in other films, and in much better films than `The Mummy Returns'.<br/><br/>Performances:  Brendan Frasier is pretty good, but his character Rick is more or less a mechanism for delivering quips and punchlines, nothing more. Rachel Weisz, whose character is much stronger than she was in the first `Mummy' film, is actually quite good  she blends the cliched damsel-in-distress role with a certain amount of feistiness and sarcasm that makes her very, very appealing.  Arnold Vosloo is wasted yet again as the Mummy  all the guy does is sneer and flex his muscles.  The Mummy's not scary, he's boring cardboard.<br/><br/>`The Mummy Returns' isn't nearly as good as `The Mummy'.  Then again, it's not nearly good, period.  Possibly worth watching if in you're in a mood for idiotic fun, but even then, you can do much better than this needless waste of film.  Grade:  C-"

","First off, I did enjoy this film immensely, as I did the original.Obviously, neither is deathless cinema, and while the original had maybe a bit more innocence and charm, this one makes up for it with a certain depth. Problem is that it gets lost in all the special effects... Let me get to my main point, though, which was something I arrived at in reading the demographics on the votes. Almost every ""real"" review I have seen of this film makes a point of it being geared towards adolescent males, and this is where the surprise lies. Because across the board, this film is favored by women...and not necessarily the younger ones. Until I noted those figures, I thought I might be alone, but just let me speak for a moment to any of those ladies out there who might be wondering if this is something they might enjoy...Yes, it is too loud. Yes, it has way too many computer generated action sequences. Yes, there are gaping holes in the plot... But it's fun. It's a great movie to watch with the kids, and also one to enjoy alone. There's romance of both the worldly and otherworldly variety.There's a movie kid who is actually appealing.For those who like him, there's Brendan Fraser at his swashbuckling best.There are strong female characters(though I personally thought Anck-su-Namun turned out to be a real B****) It has some captivating eye candy in the shape of Oded Fehr, and last but by no means least, the writhe-in-your-seat-sexy Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep. Ah! Those guilty pleasures!"

","I greatly anticipated this movie, having been a fan of the first Mummy.  I do recommend you see the first movie before you see this one.  Some of the jokes relate to the first one.  This movie, in my opinion doesn't top the The Mummy, but sequels rarely do.  It does give a good try and if you liked the first one, you will probably like this one as well.  You will love Rick O'Connell, the boy has some witty lines, and Evie is more than just a woman screaming ""Rick!! every two seconds.

Why couldn't he go on the adventure fighting instead of just flying a hot air balloon. Why did he have to have faded gold teeth in his mouth. The only big black star character in the movie was the Rock. Don't get me wrong, the movie was great. Why would the writers put that character in the movie? Just a thought."
"obisteffs","8","1","1","4 May 2001"," Good new direction
","The Mummy is just one of those movies that I enjoy more each time I see it. In 1999 I was expecting an action adventure film and instead was treated to a nicely paced horror movie with a new touch due to Stephen Sommers. In the sequel Sommers changed the direction from horror to what I was originally expecting. This change in genre was one of the smartest things Sommers could have done in giving us more of the same, but different. Much like the difference between Alien and Aliens. They are really two different films.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I enjoyed the Mummy more each time is due to the enjoyable characters. For one reason or another I really wanted to know what happened to these people and getting to see them 10 years later was a big bonus. Most of the characters have more defined roles this time and its good to see some character growth in a sequel.<br/><br/>The plot is thrown at us faster this time around with much more going on. But Stephen Sommers never cheats with the writing. Everything is mentioned once, twice, and then action! A familiarity with the first one is helpful since Sommers has the kid experience many of the same things his parents did last time creating some cross generation/movie jokes. Sommers also respects the conventions of the original Universal Mummy movies giving us an excellent climax that is above the usual action. Like the original Mummy this plot is one that has the ability to grow on you more with multiple viewings.<br/><br/>The crew behind the scenes do an excellent job as they did before. Cinematography, Sound, and Art Direction all create an engrossing movie experience. Alan Silvestri picks up Jerry Goldsmith's score and continues its themes. Their are some FX quibbles from ILM but mostly just some weird background and the finale features a creature on par with 1997's Lost in Space that could stand some improvement. But they also have some great set pieces with the returning Warrior Mummies and an impressive ground battle that reminds one of the Phantom Menace's. Meanwhile Sommers has obviously been influenced by some of his competition in summer's past. Some of the fight scenes have some Gladiator and Matrix-esque touches to them that seem out of place in a movie like this. Sommers directorial style was so clean in the Mummy and his previous adventure Deep Rising that these flashes of slow-mo stand out very conspiciously. To his credit everything else is framed very well with some great introductions for our heroes.<br/><br/>While it's true that the Mummy Returns isn't terribly original, it does derive from the best. The Mummy had a hard time getting out from Indiana Jones' shadow and the sequel seems to embrace this with many elements reminisicent of Indy's first sequel The Temple of Doom. Spielberg and Lucas influences abound as well as an image from James Cameron and a small Kubrick nod. (See if you can find the Dr. Strangelove homage.) But it's all in good fun as we are taken on this incredible adventure. If you enjoyed the first film you'll be very satisfied by the change in direction for this one. Its far enough from the original to give you a new experience but it never forgets the original. While their are deeper film experiences out there you'll be very happy if you're in the mood for a fun adventure. This is a cast and crew that loves what they're doing and it influences the audience in a very positive way. Bring the popcorn and enjoy!"

"yodergoat","5","1","1","5 May 2001"," Ugh.
","Since I was a fan of the original, ""The Mummy,""  I made the mistake of expecting the same witty (and oftentimes silly) action story. I should have known better. <br/><br/>I don't know who the film-makers are aiming for with this film... it certainly does not seem to be the fans of the original, but rather, their children and to those who came to see the film because they love The Rock. It was to ""The Mummy"" what ""Phantom Menace"" was to the original Star Wars trilogy, a film seemingly made to appeal to young children and to sell action figures. There was _just_ enough clever banter thrown in, as well as some really great fight sequences, to make this acceptable to older viewers, in my opinion. The introduction of yet another smart-aleck 8 year old kid does nothing for me. A child in the story is fine, but this one was just a little over the top. The kids seem to love him, though, even though I imagine that some of the same children laughing at his antics could hardly have sat through and stomached the original movie with its much more adult humor.<br/><br/>While some of the original characters are retained, only the personalities of the shifty brother, Jonathan, and the solemn tattooed warrior (I forget the name) are left intact. While I can see that the intention was to show that Rick O'Connell had grown in character to become more responsible as a husband and now as a father, it left him rather dry and boring as compared to the dashing Indiana Jones type which he had been. Quite a change, indeed, and it left me mourning for his previous flair. He was rather convincing as a concerned father and husband though. Evie also underwent a major change, going from a somewhat shy and awkward but entirely convincing bookish young woman with an honest appreciation and enthusiasm for Egyptian history to a scantily clad (is that tight, deep cleavage cut top and heavy black eyeliner _really_ what she wears as her excavation gear?) and completely confident woman. While confidence is nice, and shows the strength of a woman, I did not understand the depth of this change from her former sweet and appealing self... I suppose it is meant to appeal to men. I dunno. Or mayhap it was her ""mysterious dreams"" which instituted the change. She was not very convincing as a mother, either, it seemed. If my husband and I had been through what they had in ""The Mummy,"" I would never leave my curious and foolish young son alone in a tomb whilst I went exploring deeper to find an ancient artifact of great power which I had been dreaming about.... I would know that bad things could arise from such a situation.<br/><br/>Imhotep returns in a much less frightening role, at times seeming to be just confused and lost in the story. It seems like he was just included so they could say that the mummy ""returned."" I would much rather have seen the O'Connells battle the Scorpion King rather than have the story muddled by a not very frightening (but handsome) Imhotep. He really didn't add much to the story, and toward the end I was actually liking him as much as I did the main characters, just because he seemed more human and somewhat bumbling. His mistress, once reincarnated, is interesting as a character and pulls off her role well.<br/><br/>I was hoping that even if the story was not good, the action and special effects would still make the movie worth watching. True for the fights... they really were awesome and intense. But the special effects? Sigh. Nope! If anything, they pulled it down. The backdrops were fuzzy and too pale (they actually made my eyes hurt), the creatures looked as if they had a few more computer-imaging steps to go through, and the Scorpion King was just plain fake looking. Scary, though. I think that the battle scenes betwixt the army o' Annubis and the Magi were well done, but closeups of the jackal warriors left something lacking. Very smooth and battle-droidy, if you know what I mean. The airship was just silly, silly, silly. Why an airship? Why, oh why? It looked like something off of some made-for-TV adventure movie, and just made me want to giggle. <br/><br/>Aside from the effects and characters, the story itself was disjointed and weak. Too many coincidences, too many subplots that amounted to very little, and horribly strained dialog and chase scenes that smacked of being forced. Take out the suddenly rather lame Imhotep, take out the whole reincarnation and ""chosen one"" deal, take out the whole ludicrous airship sequence, and take out most of the pygmy mummies... and perhaps that would have made it worth watching. As it was, I was ready to be done with it not even halfway through the film, and caught myself thinking about other things... my garden, whether or not to go to Wal-Mart after the movie, and so on. Not minding when you need to get up to go to the restroom is not a good sign.<br/><br/>I think that the return of the Scorpion King and his legions of minions with their world domination plan would have sufficed for a good story without throwing in all of the riff-raff about Imhotep and past lives. It was simply rambling and long, much like my comments here! This film really semed like it wasn't finished, that there was still some MAJOR editing left to do, and of course the CGI needed to be actually completed rather than seemingly just thrown together for a test run. And the blaring, clanging music was driving me insane with its insistence.... WATCH THE ACTION! BE EXCITED! BE SAD NOW! BE SCARED! BE HAPPY! When the music tries to drive me along like that with its volume and clamor.... argh!!! I am not a fool and can deduce at which times I am supposed to feel a certain emotion without being led along by the hand by overpowering instrumentals.<br/><br/>I am very disappointed, and I can honestly say that even if I HADN'T liked or even seen the first movie, I still would not have enjoyed this one.    <br/><br/><br/><br/>I gave it 5 stars out of 10. Right up there with Mission to Mars!!!"

","Here is another ""Class A exhibit"" on how to turn a successful, appealing movie into a ludicrous stupid one with a sequel that overkills everything that worked in the first movie.<br/><br/>When the 1999 film, ""The Mummy"" came out, it features a likable family: husband, wife and young son - battling all kinds of strange and fascinating foes in ancient Egypt. It was simply a fun movie with awesome special-effects that dazzled millions of theater-goers. The story was ludicrous but took a back seat to the astounding visuals and the nice family whom we could root for.<br/><br/>Then the sequel comes out - Mummy 2, if you will - and now (a) the wife (played by Rachel Weisz) has turned macho; (b) the kid is now a mouthy snot; (c) the action scenes have gone from a good number to an excessive amount where it is two hours of non-stop mayhem; (d) the sound has gone from loud to ear-shattering. In other words, here we go again with ""excess"""" or ""overkill,.""<br/><br/>It's too much....way too much....and so poorly done I am not surprised a third in the series hasn't been released, although rumors have it there will be another in 2008.

","The first Stephen Sommers mummy-movie, released in 1999, already was a lousy and overly boisterous film that focused on the visual eye-candy rather than to re-tell the classic Imothep-tale properly. Still, it had its compelling moments and enough humor to put the whole production into perspective. Even the more experienced horror fan, who seeks atmosphere instead of excitement, could find a bit of joy in ""The Mummy"". This rapidly finished sequel, however, fully aims itself at (pre-) teen audiences who never in their lives saw a good movie and waste their days with playing video games! The script is a mess, revolving on the resurrection of Imothep (again) and the coming of a new Egyptian bad-boy, namely ""The Scorpion King"". Rick and Evelyn O'Connor (the heroes of the first) as well as Imothep intend to destroy ""The Scorpion King"", but for different purposes. The mean mummy wants to take of command of Scorpion's army and wipe out the world whereas the archaeologists-couple tries to prevent this. There's a giant amount of totally redundant sequences and it looks like they were only added to show good the makers are with computer-engineered special effects. Okay, we got it...tell a story instead! Every dead end or illogical aspect in the script is resolved with another attention-distracting visual trick and  after a while  it looks like the writers aren't even trying to be ingenious anymore. The acting is really bad with Fraser and Weisz both thinking about their paychecks instead of their lines and the introduction of cinema's most annoying child-actor in history: Freddie Boath. He's an 8-year-old brat who supposedly has more archaeologist-knowledge than an army of university professors. John Hannah also walks around the sets for no reason. He had a few funny one-liners and grimaces in the first film, but his part here is pretty much pointless. For some incomprehensible reason, this movie is pretty loved among IMDb-members (judging by the ratings and user comments) but I can't think of any positive (or even redeeming) comments in favor of it. I'm sorry"

I'm a big fan of special effects, if they're justified by the movie they're in.<br/><br/>But this is flat-out one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The writing and direction are simply atrocious, beyond bad.  Scenes are shot as if without any forethought or planning or concept of what they'll look like on the screen.  The story is so stupid that it's outright insulting -- not because it's about dead people coming to life, and so forth, but because it makes almost no sense at all and yet still manages to be completely predictable.<br/><br/>Dull story, bad action scenes, boring characters, tedious visuals, lame special effects -- just a colossal waste of money and talent.  They spent about $100 million making this, and it looks like maybe $25 million.  Not that it would be worth that.<br/><br/>Not half as good as ""Deep Rising"", by the same writer-director, and *that* wasn't exactly a great movie.

","I can't even begin to put into words how horrible this movie is. The total lack of effort in creating an interesting story and translating it onto film was beyond my comprehension as to why movies are made. This embodies everything that a film should not be... a story that serves no purpose either to itself or to the audience, the lack of interesting characters (because who really cared about what happened to any of them throughout the movie?), and senseless action that didn't even drive the plot (oh look, here comes another tidal wave with the dude's face in it for no reason). The Mummy Returns just goes to show how technology, which is suppose to enhance the visual aspect of an actual story, has been manipulated so that movies nowadays are only about how cool stuff looks onscreen without taking any interest to the film itself. And on top of that, this movie's visual effects weren't even good. It just looked like Brenden Fraser in a cheap cartoon. This kind of modern raping of the cinema has most likely ruined the minds of the mass viewers. Aside from the fact that it grossed $200 million dollars, which shows how tasteless movies like this have made us, it really isn't worth it once we realize how far behind this will put us in ever going back to making quality movies again."

","This movie is so packed with CGI that it makes it look like a video game demo. After watching quite a large number of new computer generated movies, it all comes down to this: the effects are good, only if the director is talented enough to make them look real.<br/><br/>In my opinion only three artists incorporated computer effects successfully in their movies: Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott and James Cameron. Only these people created movies with heavy use of cgi in the last 10 years that looked real (in fact they looked so real that you didn't even notice them).<br/><br/>Apparently for some people computers can give you all the power to create anything visually, without using any of the old days' craftsmanship. 'The Mummy Returns' looks fake, especially at the climax of the movie. When Scorpion King arrived, I was looking for my joystick! Didn't anyone realize that they should combine real shots of the Rock with some cgi?<br/><br/>As a story, 'the Mummy Returns' is okay for a sequel, quite inventive at places and with some nice sence of humor. Still, it takes a lot of talent for someone to create the new 'Indiana Jones'.<br/><br/>To all directors: Please go back to using miniatures and physical photography. Watch the 1993 Jurassic Park to study what's real. (That goes also for some old timers that return to their saga after 20 years, just to shows us cartoons!)"

First of all, parts of it felt like the characters KNEW they were making a bad sequel. Comments like ""Here we go again."" and ""I thought we killed him"" are never a good thing.  Second, the special effects were sub par.  The scorpion king looked like a smashed roach behind the wall of Joe's apartment.  Third, the plot was not very convincing or believable. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! When the scorpion king's army attacks, somehow they all die but the ""good guys"" (whoever they are, I wasn't really sure) do not receive a scratch. It seems possible that hordes of sand monsters could inflict a little damage.<br/><br/>This was possibly the Worst movie I saw last summer.

This has to be a prime example of all that is wrong with the Hollywood summer blockbuster. Yes you must suspend disbelief & go with the flow but this film has nothing of merit. The acting is awful with wooden performances all-round amidst very poor (not so) special effects, in particular the laughable Scorpion King at the end. Most of the effects would not look out of place on your standard games console & look rushed & cheap. I wouldn't be surprised if they were quickly done to get the film out. Its a movie made by special effects geeks for special effects geeks. The original was a pretty good adventure film but this is a real Indiana Jones wannabe without the likable characters,wit,style or coherent plot just a series of set-pieces cut together.

But the plot makes no sense (something about a Scorpion King and the Mummy fighting), characterizations are nonexistent and there's some truly awful dialogue.  Also in a movie that takes place in the 1930s, terms like ""Are we there yet?"" ""Whatever..."" and ""Get a room"" did not exist! That may be nitpicking, but it bothered me.  Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz and John Hannah all reprise their roles from the original.  They're all very good here...too bad they have nothing to play with.  But, I was never bored.

"bob the moo","Null","4","10","4 February 2002"," ""Adventure is reborn"" (feet first!)
","10 years after they stopped Imhotep taking over the world, Rick and Evelyn are married with a son, Alex. Again they accidentally set off a chain of events that awakens Imhotep from his resting place in the British Museum. However a second force has been released in the shape of the Scorpion King and Rick and Evelyn must race to stop both from destroying the world. Meanwhile Evelyn begins to experience flashbacks that reveal that she may have been Princess Netertiri, daughter of Pharaoh Seti.<br/><br/>As with every big blockbuster, a sequel is inevitable. It generally doesn't matter whether the first film was good or not, or if the sequel is well thought out or not. It only matters that it guaranteed to make a set percentage of the original's profit and therefore not a risk. The story here feels forced from the very start - first the introduction of the kid makes it feel like they're just trying to keep it interesting by adding characters (if the first film was like Raiders then this is definitely Temple of Doom). Secondly we suddenly discover that Evelyn is the reincarnation of Princess Nefertiri! How come this little gem never came out in the first film? The addition of 'The Scorpion King' is so minor that you wonder why they used his character at all - then you see that the Mummy 3 will be subtitled 'the scorpion king' and you realise that it was just another excuse to spin money (especially when you see that The Rock was put in the role).<br/><br/>The fact that the script has stopped trying is a real drain on how much fun you can have. Right from the start (the fight in Rick's house) you see this - all the main characters just 'show up' at the fight at exactly the right time! Even Ardeth Bay and Jonathon show up - despite the fact that Ardeth just came from Egypt! This laziness is apparent all through the film, it relies on big bangs and OTT action scenes to carry the film.<br/><br/>Fraser loses another truck load of credibility by doing this - he's good, but it's obvious that he was too blinded by dollars to read the script. Weisz is terrible - even if she gets more of an action role, her character is still daft. Hannah seems to know he's in rubbish and just wants to get through it and get paid. Boath as the young Alex is all cute, cheeky child adventuring - a perfect example of how cute children are the death of films.<br/><br/>For me the saddest performance was Lock-Nah (Adewae Akinnuoye-Agbaje) - it was sad because I know what he's capable of. For anyone who's seen HBO's Oz he played the monstrous Simon Adebesi. In Oz Adewale gave a great performance over 3 or 4 series where his character changed significantly, so he can act but he's never going to be a leading man, so I guess he was happy to get in a big film.<br/><br/>Overall this is laughable - unlike the first movie, it's impossible to ignore the sheer daftness of the whole thing. If you don't believe that this is merely a money spinning production rather than an attempt to make a good film then check out the special effects on the Scorpion King at the end. They look so terrible (like a Sega mega-drive's effects) because the effects process was rushed through in order to get the film out into the market."
"kersus","4","3","7","15 January 2008"," Fluff Sequel
","The Mummy Returns is a quick fluff action piece with some poor slapstick comedy. It uses numerous Deus Ex Machina for the sake of using them. One might feel there's the use of retconning here too, but again, even those were completely out of place.<br/><br/>It is pretty much a family movie (far more so than the first one) but some young children could be scared by the mummies. For the most part it is upbeat and doesn't ever give you the feeling that anything will go wrong.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Bad guy comes back to beat another bad guy to rule the world and the good guys try to stop them all. Most of the characters do a lot of traveling and then have a showdown. Mixed in is some chumming of the good guys that leads no where. Plus they add fate/destiny stuff just to make sure we don't get any more sequels.<br/><br/>It assumes the audience has attachment to the characters and assumes you feel the good guys are a tight group but never really builds that up. It's hard to tell if the movie was just poorly made, or if there was really a much grander and broader story that had to be cut down to a couple hours.<br/><br/>The acting is okay except for Patricia Velasquez who seemed wooden, but that might have been the directing and not her. She was quite sexy, so it balances out. Rachel Weisz was far sexier in this movie than the first, and the rest of the cast does okay; certainly Brendan Fraser is very comfortable in his role as Richard 'Rick' O'Connell.<br/><br/>If you watch it right after the first movie, you'll notice clearly that the CGI is a lot worse in returns. This adds to the idea that it was just a poorly written movie to cash in on the first movie's success. Besides the poor CGI, the action sequences really are quite well done. They're easy to follow, are fast paced, and include more dynamics than the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>This is a different movie than the first one. It's less Indiana Jones and more.... well think of a bad kids movie that's supposed to be an adventure but seems silly.<br/><br/>It really doesn't feel like it meshes with the first movie (especially the love between Anck Su Namun and Imhotep), and while it introduces the Scorpion King idea, it again doesn't mesh with that movie at all. Unfortunately I think it ended this franchise when it really should have spring-boarded a series of movies had it been done with more thought.<br/><br/>With all of that said, ultimately it is a fun movie if you don't care about verisimilitude and as I said, most people would see it as fun for the whole family. It just lacks depth, solid writing, directing, and decent CGI. If you can snag it cheap, you'll feel like you got your money's worth. It isn't one of those movies where you just feel cheated for your time. It's okay, fluffy fun; just turn off your brain first."

The action is boring and repetitive. The story is pointless.

He and his wife Evy along with their son, Alex find the bracelet of Anubis while a British Museum curator and Imhotep's old lover resurrects the powerful Imhotep. Alex gets kidnapped by Imhotep because he wears the bracelet and that is the guide to the Scorpion King. Now the O'Connells with Ardeth Bay have to rescue Alex and prevent Imhotep from taking control over the Scorpion King's army.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Fraser did a better job than he did in the first film. Rachel Weisz is even more beautiful in this film and she is a fine actress. John Hannah cracked me up even more as the stupid uncle. The presence of a kid, Freddie Boath added youth to this film. I was happy to see that Oded Fehr got more screen time as the serious, bold protector of Imhotep's tomb.<br/><br/>The special effects are much more effective especially when the water demon was chasing the O'Connells in the hot air balloon.

","All the key players are back for this more spectacular variation of the new Mummy villain - an Egyptian high priest thousands of years old with many supernatural powers. The first 5 minutes, with the new character The Scorpion King essayed by The Rock, actually outdoes the '99 film right off the bat; everything is more, as is the case with such sequels - about 10%-15% more, like a formula. The box office grosses seem to bear this out - throw in more, and the crowds will come - this out-grossed the '99 movie. But, more what, really? More money spent on the special computer FX? That's it. When commenting on a film such as this, it's more appropriate to focus on 'the ILM guys' - the ones who construct all the fake armies and sprouting foliage out of nowhere. Did they spend the computer money well, is the main question. I suppose so. I'm not a computer FX expert.<br/><br/>I am familiar with movies such as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and its own sequels. The '99 Mummy movie was derivative of those adventures and this is a copy of the '99 movie. So all the stuff in the old crypts and hidden tunnels and funky pyramids is very old (no pun intended) by now. The scouring beetles make a brief early appearance and still manage to creep out a bit, but the rest is just a slightly enlarged/expanded take on the menace of the same old Mummy. They advanced the story a few years from the previous movie, indicated by the new son of the two main characters (Fraser & Weisz). And this is the only new element, the threat to the young son, which deviates from the first flic. ""The Scorpion King"" offshoot picture arrived soon after this but what really surprises me about the franchise is that no 3rd Mummy picture has surfaced, yet. Money speaks more than a Mummy, as they say."

","I agree with Snow 20. Imhotep and anck-su-namun were so in love there was no way she would have run off like a coward and left him to die. This is the same woman that stabbed herself in the stomach in the first movie! If anything, she would have hurled herself into that fiery pit with Imhotep. This scene really spoiled the movie for me and up to that point I was having a great time.<br/><br/>Yes, the Scorpion King looked like a plastic jerk and the CGI wasn't up to snuff, but you couldn't help being entertained by it. It was exciting, action packed and managed to squeeze in some great battle scenes, love scenes, and even an ancient fight scene between women (Nefertiri and anck-su-namun).<br/><br/>Oded Fehr (Ardeth Bey) has to be one of the hottest actors on the planet! The man is simply gorgeous and quite talented. He is definitely leading man material. There were so many good looking men to drool over: Ardeth, Rick and Imhotep. If I were Evy, I'd want to date both Ardeth and Rick and decide (much, much later) which one I wanted to marry. Okay, so marry Rick, live an upper-class life in England with your husband and son, but at least experience Ardeth first. Spend a few months out in the desert with this hunk and get a little ankle tattoo to remember him by! <br/><br/>I felt sorry for Imhotep, and in this movie, he didn't seem to be the bad guy at all. I thought he had gotten a raw deal in the first Mummy anyway. He was just in love with the wrong woman and was willing to sacrifice everything to be with her. Who wouldn't have gotten ""a little riled"" at having one's tongue cut out, being buried alive and slowly eaten by scarabs, and then having an eternal curse put on you! I would have returned and kicked a few asses too. In this movie, all he seemed to really want was to be with anck-su-namum again. She was the monster in this one, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Imhotep really didn't seem to have his heart into ""ruling the world"" and seemed happier once he was reunited with her, only to have her run off and leave him to die. I had tears in my eyes along with him and you could see he was heartbroken and no longer cared what happened to him. Here is little Evy dodging falling columns and leaping over breaking ground to save her man and anck-su-namun was supposed to be the bad-ass female warrior who would do anything for her man. She got what she deserved though and I cheered as the scarabs picked her bones clean. Too bad Imhotep couldn't have seen that! They never really explained how anck-su-namun was reincarnated in the first place. She just shows up in 1930s clothes, with a new name and spouting English like a native.<br/><br/>Evy seems to have lost her sense of humor and ditzy ways in this one all together. I guess thats what 10 years of marriage and having a bratty kid will do for you. Now, she is a no nonsense, humorless, treasure seeker (instead of the librarian she proudly proclaimed herself to be in The Mummy) and just didn't seem as much fun as she used to be. Her clothes seemed awfully revealing for 1933 too. She is still very beautiful but just boring - even with her new butt kicking skills.<br/><br/>The little boy's role was totally unbelievable. Not his acting - he did a decent job with what he was given - but he seemed to act more like a child of 12 or 13 years instead of 8. He was too self possessed, too articulate and too brave. Nothing scared him, he apparently had artistic talent well beyond his years (perfect sand depictions of ancient Egyptian cities and monuments were left as clues for his parents), he read and understood ancient Egyptian words that he wouldn't have really grasped even in English. He didn't seem upset when he thought that he lost both his parents in the dirigible crash and didn't shed a tear when he saw his mother knifed before his eyes. Just matter of fact and ready to go on with his life. The brother didn't even seem upset either. Now thats taking the stiff upper lip British thing too far!

Naturally horror strikes again as a mysterious woman (Patricia Velasquez, who basically had a cameo in the original) resurrects Vosloo and also tries to resurrect his ancient mistress (also played by Velasquez). The powers combine to try and defeat the Scorpion King (an warrior of the past played by The Rock) and his army back in ancient Egypt. The plan is to kill The Rock and turn his army to their side of darkness. Once again it is up to adventurer Brendan Fraser, Egyptologist Rachel Weisz (now Fraser's wife), their adolescent son (Freddie Boath) and Weisz's brother (the comical John Hannah) to stop Vosloo and Velasquez before they are able to take control of the world for good. ""The Mummy Returns"" is a little jumping jack of a film that does not come straight at you near as well as the original did. If anything, this picture may be a little too smart for its own good. Old replays and concepts from the first installment come back with ho-hum results.

","This movie hurt me in a way that I have never been hurt before.  I feel it was the worst movie that I have ever seen in a theatre....<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns is a non-stop thrill ride of plot holes, superficial acting, poorly done special effects, and scenic rip-offs of well known movies.  Only one other movie I have seen drove me to the point of screaming while I watched it, I was overcome with a desire to warn others that they should not see this film.<br/><br/>While I sat in the theatre, I was wistfully remembering horrid films that in comparison outshine this.... this.. ugh, words fail to describe this monstrousity.  I remember films like: Congo, Ishtar, Howard the Duck; I found myself thinking about how much fun I'd be having if these films were on the screen instead of the Mummy 2.  I wished for a power failure, earthquake, hurricaine, anything to stop the pain that was throbbing behind my eyes.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the storyline, mainly because I felt the movie lacked one...maybe there is a rosetta stone buried somewhere in Hollywood that fills in the tattered swiss-cheese plot.  Or maybe the makers of this film are true sadists and have planned a Mummy 3 that will run along the same time frame filling in the holes in Mummy 2.   God, I hope not.<br/><br/>My friend I watched the movie with summed it up very well when he said, ""You have to treat movies like this like you would treat a bear attack... Just try to go limp, hope you survive, and try to cover up your genitalia.""<br/><br/>I'll conclude with a plea to anyone who is listening, don't go see this movie, if you waste the price of admission on this terrible movie, you'll likely never forgive yourself."

","This mess is probably the worst sequel of any movie I have ever had the misfortune to view.  Not that the original was anything to brag about, of course, with its complete disregard for the religion and culture of the Ancient Egyptians, but at least it had some semblance of plot and coherence though.  This abomination has neither.  It is all Hollywood hype and marketing at its worst, anything to make the buck.  Of course, from a business point of view it is a wild success, just about the most profitable movie opening ever.  No accounting for taste, what?  All this despite the fact that the computer graphics look as though they were designed by a 3 year old (and a not very bright 3 year old at that) and the story written on the fly.  The acting, what there is of it squeezed between the CGI ""action"" sequences which fills most of the movie, is abyssmal.  The female lead looks about as Egyptian as a bowl of borscht.  Nothing hangs together or is even remotely plausible.  I would just hope that anyone who actually wastes their money on this dog (and I don't mean jackal) is fooled into believing that this travesty has any relation whatsoever to real Egyptian history."

"Kuntos_the_Destroyer","1","2","4","12 July 2001"," Could have been a video game movie.
","Here, at last and for your consideration, is a film that is so very nonsensical the term movie doesn't even apply to it. The Mummy Returns is basically a rehash of  the action sequences from such blockbusters as Raiders of the Lost Ark, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Lost World: Jurassic Park (you'd have to be pretty desperate to rip off that last one, right?). I'd go through all of The Mummy Returns' 'influences' here, or at least more of them, if it wasn't such a behemoth task. And then 'writer/ director' Stephen Sommers connects these action sequences through something which only by videogame standards (ten years ago) could be called a plot.<br/><br/>But then, you may ask, sometimes you don't watch movies for intelligent plotting, clever subtexts, deep and moving performances or even a coherent and fitting visual style. Sometimes all you want is your money's worth in excitement, adrenaline, thrills and spills. While spills are abundant here, the other three are sadly passed by. There's an uninspired (but expensive!) bus chase through Londen, one-and-a-half CTHD-style choppily edited (but expensive!) fight sequences and innumerable predictable (but expen..- oh, who cares) scenes featuring CGI creatures. Yes, The Mummy Returns certainly has its fair share of visual effects, although the quality is often debatable. But its main problem is, the excitement, adrenaline and thrills never take off, because Sommers does not only forget to establish any real kind of threat, he also doesn't make us care about the characters. Sommers seems to argue that effects equal excitement, but they do not.<br/><br/>Now, to be honest, I never saw The Mummy (nor am I very anxious to). When it came out in 1999, after The Matrix had proven action could be done in a stylish and clever way, I never really felt like seeing another popcorn no-brainer. And to be honest, I can't think of a single pure no-brainer since The Matrix that I really enjoyed (unless you're counting Gladiator). But still, at least with M:I-2, X-Men, and even Hollow Man I found highlights and I could follow something of a storyline. The Mummy Returns is for me nothing more than a rumoured $160 million of computer-generated nonsense. I could've spent two hours watching grass grow, and I'd still be more entertained.<br/><br/>Rating: 1/10"

This movie was meant to reunite an excellent cast and to have fun.  You can tell this from many of the parallels between the original and the 2nd.  So, if you go into this movie with about the same amount of seriousness as the first, then you will have fun.  As for the SFX, it is also about the same.  Not meant to be completely realistic bordering on comic book style.  The majority of it fit the style of the movie perfectly which is good, since if the SFX were any more realistic, then it would force you to look at the movie more seriously than you should. The exception to this was that the Scorpion King was a little less impressive than what he could have or should have been.<br/><br/>In terms of fun, it deserves a 9.

He was a pointless addition, as it's obvious he's just there for brief (and un-funny) comic relief. John Hannah revises his role of 'Jonathan Carnahan, and is painfully annoying in this picture. He was much more entertaining in the first movie, and is disgraced even more in this. Aside from the flat and boring characters, we have the love story between Imhotep and Anck Su Namun, which is a disgrace to to any love story ever written.

I think I even saw a scene with one of the extras in the background, trying to run off camera. As for the Egyptian theme of the work: there was one authentic-looking box which contained the stylistically strange ""scorpion bracer,"" and there was an outdoor shot of Abu Simbel which looked very nice but was an obvious model. That's about it for accuracy. Everything else is either a hodge-podge of other historic styles, or has a lumpy we-had-a-tatoo-artist-design-this look to it.

Sure it might not have been entirely original but it was FUN and it never took itself seriously. Plus Jerry Goldsmith conducted a wonderful score.<br/><br/>With this film, it takes itself way too seriously, has a TERRIBLE score(Alan Silvestri sucks!), and it is a ripoff of the Indiana Jones Trilogy(whoever thinks Brendan Fraser-while a cool guy-is better than Indiana Jones is insane), The Matrix, and The Lost World. The little pygmy warriors serve absolutely no point in this dreck. They pluck people down and attack them EXACTLY like the Velociraptors did in The Lost World. Rick O'Connell fights Imhotep with some Matrix-ish moves and The Scorpion King( this guy is only in the film for less than five minutes!) throws enemies to the ground in the style of The Matrix.<br/><br/>The CGI is an embarassment. ILM has done GREAT work on so many other films, and they did a totally horrible job on this. When the giant scorpion with the Rock's head appeared at the end, I laughed myself silly at it's hokiness, as did many others in the packed theater. Either Stephen Sommers wanted to pay homage to Ray Harryhausen or he just wanted to do a rush job and that much is clear through the whole film. If he had another year(all sequels should at least have three years inbetween them) to work on this, he could have refined the CGI and plot so much more. Yes this is a popcorn movie and it was never intended to be Shakespeare but The Mummy had decent acting, great CGI, and a coherent plot. The Mummy Returns has none of these things.<br/><br/>I highly advise anyone who has not seen this film to not see it.

","OK, since I've already watched ""The Mummy"", I might as well carry on with its sequel, especially since much of the main cast (lead by Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) have returned, and the first one was so much fun. How bad can it be? Well, bad is in the eye of the beholder, and this is extremely enjoyable for what it is in spite of the fact that like most fantasy action films of the past 20 years, it can be just TOO much. Even though this came out before the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, it has some of the elements that made later entries in that series far too complicated even with its simplicity. Convoluted, often confusing, mainly because there's far too much going on, far too many characters, far too much action to get in one sitting, and with hundreds of thousands of movies to watch, who wants to go back and see something again that they didn't get the first time. OK, me, but that's when I need a break from fresh celluloid.<br/><br/>Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson dominates the first reel of this film as the Scorpion King, an Egyptian warrior who, while on the verge of death, offered himself up to one of the Gods of darkness in exchange for more time to conquer his enemies. That he gets, with the sudden appearance of a tropical paradise in the middle of the desert, and then he's off to battle with the aide of demonic looking monsters aiding him. But when his time is up, it's up, and he's pulled away to fulfill his promise. Centuries go by, and the scorpion bracelet ends up on the arm of Fraser and Weisz's son, and that could open up a great big can of flesh eating beetles and once again destroy the world. The only way to conquer the Scorpion King is to bring back Imhotep, last seen being pulled into the muck after his eternity was pulled out by mysterious beings on a white chariot.<br/><br/>This probably plays better on a digital TV than it did in the theater because by the sounds of things, it is extremely loud, and I like to be in control of the height of my movie watching volume. This takes everything that was good about ""The Mummy"" and practically quadruples it. That makes it fun in spots, too much to really collect in your movie going memory in most places, yet always keeping your attention. At least there is a story there, and the continuity from the first film to this hasn't been greatly sacrificed outside the return of Imhotep. If you can get past the absurdities, you'll have a good time, but my mind's eye tells me that I'll have to give this another shot again in about five years to catch what I missed the first two times around."
"fernandoschiavi","6","0","0","4 July 2020"," The elements of terror and a good capture of the period from the first film, are completely discarded here. Bigger and fun but does not have the charm as before
","With one foot in the adventurous Spielberg of Indiana Jones, the megalomaniac Stephen Sommers skillfully and unashamedly brought together all the clichés that permeate the most basic of adventure films, whether in the usual conception of good vs. evil. badly, in the inevitable romance between two charismatic protagonists, in the uncompromising epic tone of a production set in exotic environments, and in the technical pomposity to fill and please the public's eyes. Being a bet that was more than right, ""The Mummy"" earned a few million for Universal's coffers, which would inevitably end up generating a following. The producer called Stephen Sommers again, who once again wrote and directed. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr, Patricia Velásquez would also return by reprising their characters.<br/><br/>In London, inside a dark chamber of the British Museum, an old force of terror is about to be reborn. It is 1933, the year of Scorpio. It has been ten years since the brave Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Egyptologist Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) fought for their lives against Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), a 3,000-year-old enemy. Now Rick and Evelyn are married and live in London, along with their son, Alex (Freddie Boath), who is eight years old. Several events culminate in the discovery of the resurrected body of Imhotep, thanks to the help of the reincarnation of his beloved from ancient Egypt, Anck-Su-Naman (Patricia Velazquez), who killed and died for him. Thus, the mummy returns to roam the Earth, determined to carry out its search for immortality. However, another force is also at large in the world, the Scorpion King (Dwayne Johnson), who was born from the dark rituals of Egyptian mysticism and is even more powerful than Imhotep. When they face each other, the fate of Earth will be in danger and Rick and Evelyn will start a desperate race to save the world from an unspeakable evil and also to rescue Alex from the followers of Imhotep, who took the boy because he, without having a clue, he placed the bracelet of Anubis on his arm, an artifact of incredible power. On this journey they will go to Egypt and enter the Scorpion King's domain. A long time ago this terrible warrior promised his soul to the god Anubis in exchange for military sovereignty. He and his army were frozen in time, in a kind of interval between life and death, but now they are ready to kill again. The King Scorpion has more powers, secrets and strength than the fearsome Imhotep, is full of hatred and should not be disturbed.<br/><br/>Sommers established himself as a nostalgic for classic adventure, which, in the midst of his generous production in special effects and grandiose scenarios, seeks to flirt with naivety and disengagement with great ambitions that allow him to flow and breathe organically while entertainment. Anyway, here is again the whole gathering of elements that made the original taste good, improved now by a more experienced director and a cast whose tuning has grown satisfactorily from one film to the next. Of course, Sommers who does not miss the chance to shamelessly reissue the most striking moments of the original production, such as the imposing sandstorm (here taken to the sea) or the climaxes - which involved reading the Book of the Dead, was 'recreated '- and the character who reads the spell, although different from the one who performed the task the first time, gets to be confused with the same symbol - which certainly denotes a certain lack of interest in innovating in the script, even though there are curious twists and turns.<br/><br/>In ""The Mummy's Return"", Sommers makes this mistake again by creating an absurd story that serves as a mere excuse for him to portray his heroes facing, in exotic locations, digitally created villains. With this, the director manages to produce a film that entertains the audience for about two hours, but that is promptly forgotten when the lights go on. Films like Return of the Mummy always revolve around ancient curses, human sacrifices and legendary beings that are apparently indestructible. However, the first to recognize the clichés is the story's own hero, Rick, since he is the one who says the above sentence at various moments in the narrative - and this is the characteristic that redeems, at least in part, this production: by insisting on not taking himself seriously, the film ends up conquering the viewer through his humor, which tends to self-parody. Yes, parody: after all, how would you define the reaction of a certain character in this sequel, who, upon discovering what the villain's goals are, exclaims: Ah, the old trick of destroying the world '?
Much more form than content, this was a film that enriched the universe of its predecessor, but even more dumbed down a formula that, honestly, was never smart. The great asset of Return of the Mummy was to bring to the mainstream world in its first film role, still in a completely underdeveloped way, what would be, today, one of the biggest names in the world entertainment industry: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. In charge of playing the Scorpion King, perhaps the greatest warrior Egypt has ever seen, for a few minutes of the film, the character's popularity ended up being so great that the producers thought it best to give him his first film, The Scorpion King.<br/><br/>The lack of originality ends up being compensated, however, by the technical values of production. Sommers excels in the action scenes, intense and well-choreographed (there is a sensational duel between two characters), in addition to maintaining their ability to exhibit and explore the grandeur in art direction. Alan Silvestri replaces Jerry Goldsmith well in the composition of the soundtrack and maintains the scale of the production's grandeur. The production has numerous shots involving visual effects, which work in a few scenes, such as the chase of the mummies on a double-decker bus in the heart of 1930s London, but which, in general, aged extremely badly and arrive in several moments to be extremely shameful and regrettable, especially in a production of almost 100 million dollars, in which we can mention the emergence of a forest in the middle of the desert. This same forest being ""sucked"" into a pyramid, the escape of the airship from a water wall connecting its turbo, the extremely artificial look of the local pygmies and, mainly, the scenes that perhaps most people remember in this film, which is the regrettable and shameful CGI of the Scorpion King, amazingly, is one of the main characters in the plot. The most powerful warrior in ancient Egypt, here, seems to have come out of a video game whose lack of budget did not allow it to be finished. Not only the face, but the whole movement of the character takes away all the sense of danger and urgency from the climax of the film, causing laughter and greatly impairing the final experience of those who watch it.<br/><br/>Even the elements of terror and a good capture of the period and its classicist features from the first film, are completely discarded here. Becoming just that big-scale action-adventure movie that, while fun, doesn't have the same charm as before. Sommers certainly wanted to adapt new blockbuster rules and please the general public, and he still does not do badly in directing the action that is well shaped and still has matinee elements. Even if you come to opt for generic elements of constant slow motion and quick cuts, with some vexamous visual fuss. ""The Mummy's Return"" is not a film that can be considered bad. He has good times, despite a substantial amount of poorly performed effects along with recycling and repetition of past plots, not to mention some rather stupid and even contradictory decisions to the first film. Arnold Vosloo's Imothep in the first film had the power to control the ten plagues that plagued Egypt, an even smart and cool balcony, and here out of nowhere he apparently has the power to levitate people by hand; climbing walls with your hands; create tsunamis with a gelatinous face of yours; anyway ... he became a perfect villain of the X-Men that the X-Men never had.<br/><br/>The film, like the first one, has a good sense of rhythm and never fails to slow down in a way that is always direct to the point of the thread and surprisingly cohesive. And even with the countless new villainous characters and the presence of almost 5 different macguffins, nothing gets confused and everything is quite understandable. In the cast again we have the greatest virtues of production. Brendan Fraser, despite being more of the same, he has a lot of charisma in his Rick, and he nourishes a good chemistry with an always great Rachel Weisz who manages to be the only character to demonstrate a clear evolution from the silly historian character in danger from the first film to a woman who knows how to fight practically everything she sees ahead and her stimulus is in love for her family. And young Freddie Boath completes the family triangle that is certainly the efficient heart of the film. We have more of the same with John Hannah, the clumsy man who manages to function as comic relief as possible, and Oded Fehr with his Ardeth once again fulfilling the quota of the Arab franchise, but without any charisma.<br/><br/>The film goes far from having any more essence to make here a perfect continuation of your great and charming first film. Overall, the film ends up working well, as the action sequences are really breathtaking - but when the story comes to an end, the viewer ends up discovering that his 'old friends' remain Indiana Jones, Luke Skywalker and John McClane, not Rick O'Connell or Ardeth Bay. And this is, after all, the big difference between Stephen Sommers and other storytellers: his characters are for immediate consumption, not for a long trip."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns is an action adventure movie that premiered in 2001. The movie is directed and written by Stephen Sommers. The movie stars Brendan Fraser, and Rachel Weisz in their reprised roles from the first movie The Mummy. The Mummy Returns is the sequel to 1999's The Mummy and takes place years after the first movie. An enemy known as the Scorpion King returns with a resurrected Imhotep.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns is the definition of what a sequel should be. The movie contains elements of the first movie with the old villain of Imhotep. The movie introduces new elements that does not alienate fans of the original movie. It is overall a solid experience. If someone had liked the first movie they would enjoy watching The Mummy Returns. There are great scenes in this movie that are different than the first movie but they are the same thematically.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns is an inoffensive sequel and this is not meant as a bad thing. The Mummy Returns is a sequel that does everything that it needs to to please the audience. This is a great movie in both its action scenes, its setup, and production. Although it is not a great movie, it is an incredibly entertaining movie. The movie lacks in its story overall and it feels like a rehash of the first movie. However, I felt that this merely continued the theme of the first movie in a fun way and the movie is still enjoyable.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'The Mummy Returns'.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"darrenbjones","7","0","0","8 September 2019"," The same magic plus The Rock!!!
","When you approach a sequel the danger is not meeting the expectations of the audience, not honouring the characters established in the first film and not recreating the magic. The Mummy Returns doesn't have any of these problems, the cast is back and they're clearly still loving it, heroes and villains alike. There are some additions to the cast like Freddie Boath as Alex O'Connell and The Rock as the Scorpion King both of whom do a great job, but we're here to see Mr and Mrs O'Connell take on the evil Imhotep and we're not disappointed.
Action, adventure, romance and a lot of fun as Rick retains his shoot first, second and third approach to problems. Rachel Weisz as Evelyn gets more action and responds with aplom and John Hannah continues to be a fine comedic foil.
Mummies, mini mummies, huge undead Jackal armies and more are thrown at the cast, topped by the return of Imhotep and Anck Su Namun who also get to develop their characters and relationship to a heartbreaking degree and they provide one of the most tragic and moving parts of what is essentially a fantastic popcorn movie."

The only thing I hate about the movie is Dwayne Johnson as the Scorpion King in the climax. Shoddy animation (I know it's from 2001, but Independence Day in 1996 and Jurassic Park 1 & 2, also in the 90s, have much better animation). Rather pathetic.

","The Mummy was pretty much everything you'd expect out of a light action/adventure movie, which was fun, exciting, with the right doses of humor and wit sprinkled throughout. Simply put - it worked.<br/><br/>I don't exactly know what they were going for with The Mummy Returns, but I don't think there was really a ton of effort put into this movie at all, especially from a writing standpoint. I imagine one of the early production meetings went like this:
""Let's take the heroes and villains from the first movie and have them go at it again, but this time throw a kid in the mix. And near the end of the movie we can introduce a new villain* for about 3 minutes. Oh, and let's throw in a rocket powered hot air balloon just for the hell of it.""<br/><br/>* = Is the Scorpion King actually a villain? Because in the stand alone Scorpion King movie, he was definitely the hero.<br/><br/>To me, this movie felt like it was thrown together with little prep work and was really only done so that The Rock/Dwayne Johnson could get started on his movie career. I remember the pre-movie hype about him ""starring"" in it and then you watch it and find out it's basically just a CGI Rock near the end of the movie and he doesn't speak.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns doesn't really do much at all in terms of advancing character development of returning characters from the original and it doesn't tell a significantly new or different story. It might be one of the most pointless movies I've ever seen."

Perhaps, it was the actual action without the special effects and the use of more mystery and substance that made the first film more intriguing. The ending was a bit of a let down because the biggest weakness about the characterization of the evil Mummy's woman was that she was a weak flake, which really bums me out, because she really would have sacrificed her life to save her man too.

","Now some of you have remembered my review of the first Mummy film. While it may not be a classic, I'm one of the few people who liked it due to the likeable cast, the sets, action sequences, great music from the late Jerry Goldsmith, and atmosphere. Then when I heard that they made two sequels to this, I became interested and watched the former, this one, to see if it would be as good as the first.<br/><br/>From what I've got, it's nothing spectacular, but for what it is, this sequel is a guilty pleasure. Ok there are some problems like the story being a carbon copy of the first like some sequels, a few inconsistencies with the script and some of the effects looked great when the film came out in theaters but they don't hold up very well.<br/><br/>That being said, everything else stood out fine. The cast is still likeable especially Brendan Fraser and Arnold Vosloo (to those who don't know, kid actor Freddie Boath, who played the son of Brendan Fraser and Rachel Wiesz's characters Rick and Evelyn, chose to audition for this role instead of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's (Sorcerer's in USA) Stone. Which is a shame really, but that's life I guess), the sets are very unique, the action sequences are even better and while Alan Silversti's score may not be as strong as Jerry Goldsmith's in the original, the guy did a serviceable job providing some of the best action music in years.<br/><br/>Overall, The Mummy Returns isn't a classic, but it's still a guilty pleasure sequel and to those who haven't seen it yet, check it out!"
"Cineanalyst","4","0","0","12 October 2018"," Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Mummy
","""The Mummy Returns"" is best when it's shamelessly recycling the story from the prior ""The Mummy"" (1999), especially when the characters joke about the repetition early on. Through the double-decker bus sequence, where they fight the same mummified soldiers from the last picture, and after the woman is once again saved from bondage, and after another temple full of booby traps and secret passages, and the kid repeating mommy's domino effect of bookcases but with columns this time, this sequel excels at recapturing the magic of movement and comic relief of its predecessor and the formula that was borrowed, as many others have pointed out, from the Indiana Jones franchise. But, then, there's a tonal shift towards the dramatic, including another kidnapping and some not-so-Ancient-Egyptian nonsense about reincarnated bodies and destinies spilling over from past lives, and, like the balloon of the airship, it's as though all the air was taken out of the fun.<br/><br/>There's also an appreciation for the excess inherent in sequels--seemingly reaching back to Universal's past life of monster movie sequels beginning with ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), calling for the doubling of everything. So, now there are two mummies (Imhotep and the Scorpion King), two reincarnated women, two flashback scenes (one of which is shared by the two women), two men following ancient codes of protection (the good Egyptian from the last movie and the white American hero sporting a new tattoo), two abductions, two sets of travel and plots (train and airship), two countries, two fictional Ancient Egyptian sites and two real ones, even two black stereotypes (one the good clown, the other the evil buck). Not all of the excess amounts to much, though. The Scorpion King especially gets short shrift, and his CGI creature looks about as realistic as the stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen without an ounce of the charm. There's another curator, too, except he's evil this time, and we're offered hardly any explanation as to his motives and methods. And the whole past lives business seems to be here just so that the women can do fight moves between choppy editing just like the men. I miss the simplicity of the frumpy librarian flirting with the rugged, gun-toting adventurer.<br/><br/>In addition to this sequel, like its predecessor, opening with an Ancient Egypt flashback, there's a shared flashback vision after the tonal shift, which elaborates upon the last movie's flashback: from one perspective, it's a pool vision like the one in the 1932 Boris Karloff ""Mummy,"" and the other is from the airship. Additionally, there are the visions from the bracelet serving as this one's map. Again, there are bugs and quicksand, and now there's an army of mummified Pygmies and Anubis Jackal-men, all providing disintegrating, bloodless PG-13 deaths and violence. As well as the gaping mouths from afore, this one adds catching thrown weapons. Like the sequel ""Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (1984), a kid is added, but fortunately nobody is named ""Short Round,"" and nobody eats monkey brains."

","The second in a trilogy, though I am unsure if a third was intended at the completion of this film.
I just completed the trilogy and will sadly see the new film as well.<br/><br/>The cinematography isn't bad. 
The story is worse than the first one.
The characters are about the same. The lone exception is the child, which meant that the film would be horrible. 
It is bad enough that the ""good"" characters have superhuman abilities to avoid any danger, they can also come back from the dead.<br/><br/>I am unsure if this was used in the first or second film, but the phrase, ""Mortal weapons cannot hurt him/kill him."" He does seem to be able to get hurt with a few punches though. If a bullet doesn't hurt, why would a punch/rock/anything else?<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a stupid film. It is good if you want to sleep, as I did towards the end (the first time).
If you like it, you will probably be happy in life, as you like films that treat you like a child.<br/><br/>It made a lot of money, which isn't shocking.

Whilst on another one of their archaeological digs they come across the bracelet of Anubis and return it back to their London home. In the meantime another team of explorers find Imhotep's body and raise him from the dead and this team of explorers need this bracelet to control The Scorpion King's army and take over the world. Rick and his team must do everything in their power to stop this rival faction acquiring the bracelet and must once again try to destroy Imhotep.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns shares a lot of the same qualities as the first film; the tongue-in-cheek humour, goofy charm, and once again the tone is fairly light-hearted and fun. As with the first film, the story is fairly well-paced and moved along fairly well - the only aspect of the story that I wasn't totally impressed with was Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun's romance which was overused and given a little more focus than I felt was necessary.<br/><br/>The performances were pretty good once again; although the chemistry that Weisz and Fraser shared here wasn't quite as good as it was in the first film - maybe having them as a married couple in this film may have subdued it somewhat. As Alex, Freddie Booth gives a cheeky and fun performance and to his credit he didn't cross that fine line between being funny and annoying which was nice to see. John Hannah was good value here, although again I didn't think he was quite as funny in the second film as he was in the first film.<br/><br/>The only real problem I had with this film lay with the Scorpion King's arrival at the end.... Having seen the real Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson at the start of the film I fully expected to see the real Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson at the end of the film. However, when he does arrive rather than being Dwayne Johnson what we actually get is some kind of horrendous CGI creation of Dwayne Johnson. Why did the filmmakers feel that it was necessary to CGI Dwayne Johnson??? Couldn't they have just superimposed a scorpion's tail and claws/pincers on to his body? I can't imagine that this decision will have gone down well with his fans and I'm sure that the real Dwayne Johnson could have been used at the end as the Scorpion King with some kind of computer wizardry. Personally I thought it just looked naff and it made what should have been a tense final battle look laughable... Imhotep's cowardice at the end only made matters worse. Had the CGI been good then I might have let it slide, but it looked awful and was a misstep in my opinion.<br/><br/>Fortunately, a lot of the fun that was present in the first film is present here which, like the first film, makes this sequel watchable. However, the CGI Dwayne Johnson Scorpion King at the end was awful and almost ruined this film for me, but the key word here is almost."

However, the action sequences were satisfying, from the bus sequence, to the final battle between the Medjai and the armies of Anubis. Even though Arnold Vosloo still maintains his portrayal of power, he loses some of that original power as the danger and importance of his role is replaced with the race against time to stop the Scorpion King from being awaken. Overall, although I enjoyed most of the performances, like Fraser and Weisz, I feel that while it's enjoyable and is re-watchable, for me, its only the action sequences that make this worth returning to, rather than the characters, horror and the few yet strong battle scenes from the first film."

In all respects it's a direct continuation of the first in the series, with the viewpoint of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". THE MUMMY made a whole heap of cash at the box office, so the big wigs ordered more of the same, and what we get is THE MUMMY RETURNS. Loud, brash, and resolutely dumb, this is a film that requires you to leave your brain outside the door before sitting down to watch. It's packed with preposterous special effects and some awful acting, but despite these things, I couldn't help but enjoy it a little. It's certainly more fun than the first film, as everything's settled down a little and there are no hopes waiting to be dashed. Despite the overlong running time, THE MUMMY RETURNS provides adequate entertainment for those in a forgiving mood.<br/><br/>I won't talk about the plot – suffice to say the action shifts from Egypt to London and then finally back to Egypt again. It's all wonderfully stupid, and the script is a real clunker this time around. Unfortunately the film-makers decided to put a kid into the proceedings, and Freddie Boath plays an irritating public school brat of a boy; you'll be praying for him to get his head lopped off or at the very least lose an arm during the proceedings, but to no avail. Fraser and Weisz return as the hero and heroine; Fraser is typically wooden, while Weisz gives another absolutely appalling performance; how is this woman still getting acting jobs? Far better is John Hannah, whose comic relief role is reduced here, and the returning Arnold Vosloo seems a lot more comfortable with his central role. Heads up to The Rock, who impresses despite only having five minutes of screen time, and Patricia Velasquez, who seems to be trying to rival Weisz in terms of bad acting but who really looks the part – especially those eyes! Other characters I liked were Izzy, the black pilot; the black bodyguard, who whups major backside, and Alun Armstrong, who seems a little lost here, a world away from his usual films.<br/><br/>This being an action-adventure, you'd better pray there's plenty of action to be had, and the good news is that there most definitely is. Whether it's mummies chasing a double decker bus through the streets of London, Arabs and Westerners duking it out in displays of swordsmanship, or deadly pygmies lurking in the bush, the fight scenes come thick and fast and once again, they're heavy on the special effects. As for those FX, they're a mixed bunch, ranging from passable but seeming to deteriorate as the film progresses. By the time the completely-CGI Scorpion King shows up at the film's climax, they're hopelessly messy and quite appalling, and the cartoonish pygmies are also a disappointment. But never mind that – THE MUMMY RETURNS improves on the first film, and that's a definite good thing. Just don't go in expecting too much."

","In this movie the mummy will return to wake up, this time in London in the thirties. Rick and Evelyn will have to run against the clock in order to save the world again, and most importantly, to save their son, Alex. This is the sequel of ""The Mummy"", movie of 1999, and has the direction and script by Stephen Sommers and the participation of Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, added by Patricia Velasquez, Freddie Boath, Dwayne Johnson and Oded Fehr.<br/><br/>It's always difficult for a sequel surprising the audience that saw the first film. This film suffers from this difficulty and therefore couldn't surprise the same way as the first one. The script could also have been more interesting: the ""Scorpion King"" story is hardly convincing and sounds like a sort of publicity for the movie with that name which came out the year after. Dwayne Johnson, in turn, played his role perfectly well: this ""pseudo-actor"" is good for any role where he has to punch four times more than talk. The rest of the cast is perfectly fine, particularly Freddie Boath, who was brilliant in his role, and Arnold Vosloo, who gave his character a psychological depth that he hadn't had the opportunity to show in the first film. The soundtrack continued to be good without being exceptional, the special effects and make-up continued to make their role positively but without surprises. The computerization and digital resources surprised me most at the end of the film, which is very well done.<br/><br/>This film comes on the trail of a great movie for the family and for almost all ages. I believe that, despite not having been exactly a surprise to the public, this shouldn't be a big sin. It remains a film made with great care and in an intelligent and humorous way. It's a movie for everyone."

The first film was decent fun, this one tries to be more of the same, except it's not very funny, it is loaded with an army of clichés, including my personal most hated one, resurrection, an over-dependence on cgi, convenient and dumb reincarnations, last minute rescues that can't convince a toddler, archaeologists who should be tried for cultural crimes against humanity, etc. However, there is still one good thing at the core. The immortal romance between the bad guys makes up for a lot of these flaws, because a well-built villain is worth a lot. Especially when the good guys are ultra-annoying Brendan Fraser, simply annoying Rachel Weisz, their super-annoying kid and that not even comic relief other guy, while the evil counterparts have the better looks, more acting talent, and a superior backstory. And this is really the biggest problem, since nobody in their right mind could ever be glad for this ""happy"" ending, and no screenwriter can really explain how the woman who traversed time and space to bring back her lover proved to be less loyal than annoying Rachel Weisz was to Brendan Fraser, of all people."

","So the real issue that I can find with this sequel comes from the story and the introduction of The Scorpion King. The story is a bit blander then the first film, but only within the first half. They even recycle the main villain of the first film into the second one. The acting is set back from the first one a bit, adding new side characters that don't add as much towards the story. My other issue that arose from this film is the introduction of the Scorpion King. Some how they made an entire different spin off from this character that was in the movie for only five minutes.

Yes, I know FX doesn't make the whole movie experience, but these were so comical, so cartoonish – and even in 2001 – that the movie was more of an unintentional comedy that the humor it tried hard to produce.<br/><br/>The movie is, in fact, bookended by the worst special effects, namely the laugh-out-loud pasted on Rock's head finale, but the overall movie was so much a recap of the original 1999, that I barely remembered I was watching the sequel.<br/><br/>Granted, they decided the best way to make more money or milk this franchise dry like the deserts its set in, is just to rehash everything from The Mummy (1999.) In fact, the only thing that really changed was the transformation of the actual ""mummy"" took mere seconds when the first film took much more efforts from the characters.<br/><br/>The basic plot revolves around a soul-selling warrior – a la Scorpion King, the new adventures of the new O'Connell family and the Mummy's Revenge, sort of.<br/><br/>Look, I've only seen this movie once in theatres in 2001 and just one more time about a week ago. I've put off the review until now and I've seemed to forget everything that happened in this movie, aside from a fairly decent car/bus chase scene I did like, set in London and the atrocious and hilarious Scorpion King finale. One that was so bad, I never bothered with the spin-offs. Even if they advanced in CGI, I seriously couldn't care less to revisit that character.<br/><br/>This doesn't fair well for this movie.

","When you look at what Stephen Sommers first ""The Mummy"" movie delivered, ""The Mummy Returns"" is a perfectly acceptable sequel. We get more adventure, more action and more cartoonish horror. A blend that simply manages to entertain in an unpretentious fashion with nothing more to it. Even more so than the first film was, ""The Mummy Returns"" is a CGI/SFX oozing fest in the adventurous vein of the legendary ""Indiana Jones"" movies. Only with mummies and other fantastic shenanigans this time. It's big budget summer blockbuster fun, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. The same cast & crew returns and delivers the goods a second time. By now Fraser & Weisz's characters have a kid, so you'll just have to take him along for the ride. Naturally, this also means that the film is intended for a very wide target audience, so all the violence & horror in this film is virtually bloodless, rather aimed to be enjoyable & spectacular than frightening or gruesome. The two films can easily be watched back-to-back for 4 hours of fast-paced entertainment. Or you can go watch a 90 minutes artfilm instead. The choice is yours."

","Yet another solid Mummy film. It was rather fun watching this one but it lacks some key elements. They had to use the same villain again who died in the first film, it was bad. He died already, no need to recycle villains. The concept was rather enjoyable and they managed to put a mean looking villain in the embodiment of Mathayus, half man half scorpion.<br/><br/>The whole reincarnate angle was unnecessary. The film would have worked a lot better if they left that bit in the cutting room. It is obviously just an excuse so the two smokin' ladies can battle it out with their sais in the end of the film.<br/><br/>On a positive note, I can probably say it is a lot better than the first one. The first Mummy is one action scene short than its sequel. This one was bigger than the first in many ways.

Interesting that the third Mummy movie has taken more than seven years to get off the ground, I think perhaps the studio (or maybe even the filmmakers) knew that audiences would need years to forget how bad the first two in the series were before plunking their money down again.

"MaximumMadness","8","0","0","8 December 2007"," ""The Mummy Returns"" is one of those summer movies that is sheer, no-holds-barred fun that doesn't take itself seriously at all...
","Two years after I saw Stephen Sommer's 1999 adventure-movie classic ""The Mummy"", I was witness to the sequel that is ""The Mummy Returns."" If you read my review of ""The Mummy"", you know that I love it... It was an action treat with some great scenes, memorable characters and fantastic action.<br/><br/>""The Mummy Returns"" is definitely what I would call a 'solid summer sequel', and that implies several things: firstly, it manages to continue the storyline created in the original, maintaining what made the first movie good, whilst taking the story in new directions; secondly, it was smart enough to not abandon too much (ex. we don't mysteriously have characters disappearing between films, as happens in some sequels); and thirdly, it steps up the action and adventurous aspects of the original.<br/><br/>I will say, it does fulfill those three requirements, which I feel are necessary for a sequel's success (with few exceptions), though at the same time, I think that writer/director Sommers (who returns, along with most of the cast and crew) could have done a lot more. ""Mummy Returns"" is ultimately what I call a ""dumb-fun"" movie... It is ludicrous, and blatantly stupid at times, but still good in a way.<br/><br/>The story also seems a bit more silly and overly-fast-paced this time, only there to serve the often-overdone CG and action. However, Sommers is able to save it from being 'just another bad sequel' by working some of his quirky magic into the story and characters. I will give Sommers that... He can make the most cliché, mundane characters and situations into something special.<br/><br/>Rick O'Connell and Evie are back, now married nine years after the original, with a young son, whom is the typical trouble-making young hero you often see in these films. After they discover an ancient bracelet worn by the legendary warrior known only as 'The Scorpion King' (played briefly in a flashback by wrestling superstar The Rock), in a well-done opening action sequence that involves collapsing pillars and flooding water, the story is set in motion.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Imhotep, the evil mummy with a grudge against the O'Connells, is back, having been resurrected by some sort of oddball cult that want him to use the bracelet of the Scorpion King to bring the warrior back from the underworld. Once reawakened, Imhotep must slay him, in order to gain control of the unstoppable army of the god Anubis... the army which the Scoprion King once led thousands of years ago after striking a bargain with the Deity. With this army, nothing will be able to stop Imhotep.<br/><br/>Along the way, Imhotep kidnaps Alex (the O'Connell's son), after the bracelet permanently latches itself to him to act as a map to a pyramid of gold, where the Scorpion King lies... etc. It is all convoluted to a remarkable degree, yet, somehow still absorbing to an extent. Perhaps it is because we spent so much time with the characters in the original movie and already care about them... Maybe that is why fans were able to let go of the fact it is all so silly, and just enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>We get other returning characters, including Evie's brother Johnathan (who has some great moments) and the still cool-as-ever Magi Ardeth Bay. We also get new faces, including a silly blimp-pilot (yes, I said ""blimp pilot), and the reincarnated Anck-Su-Namoon (the love Imhotep died for so many years ago), whom hopes Imhotep can restore her to her former self.<br/><br/>But let me just skip all the story and character stuff, and get to the real meat of the movie... the action! This movie is definitely a step-up from the original in terms of sheer volume and velocity of action. From the opening flashback where we see hundreds of warriors battling with a ferocity that would make Peter Jackson blush; to a great Soldier-Mummy battle on a double decker bus; to a fiendishly funny and creepy scene involving two-and-a-half-foot-tall ""Pygmy Mummies"", pretty much anything you could even conceive of for a ""Mummy"" movie is covered, and pulled off near-perfectly.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes that feel thrown in just for the heck-of-it, though, including a new riff on the 'sandstorm' sequence from the original (this time with a wall of water) and a flashback to an ancient 'sparring session' between Anck-Su-Namoon and the Pharoh's daughter, but they aren't really bad... Just a little flat when compared to the other sequences.<br/><br/>Also, I must make one comment regarding the final battle... Without giving away too much, I will say that while most of it is fantastic, it also has some exceptionally poor CG work... Though I have since heard this was due to money/time issues. But other than that one knit-pick, it was great.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say ""Mummy Returns"" is worth seeing to any fan of action or adventure. While not as good as the original, it is certainly a fun roller-coaster ride that will entertain you..."
"pv71989-1","5","0","0","20 September 2007"," A lot of fun and a lot of errors
","I would have rated it hire if the producers hadn't tried to cram so much action down our throats. ""The Mummy Returns"" picks up seven years after the first film. Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) are married and have a precocious (and stereotypical) son named Alex (Freddie Boath).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, their peace is about to be shattered. Anck Su Namun (the incredibly gorgeous Patricia Velasquez) has been reincarnated. She has teamed up with a museum curator (Alun Armstrong) and his cult, led by Lock-Nah (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who should get an award just for hanging onto such an difficult name in Hollywood circles). Together, they excavate the ruins of Hamunaptra and unearth Imhotep. Later, they will revive him in London, try to revive the Bracelet of Anubis, kidnap Evie, sic mummies on Rick, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr), kidnap Alex and lead our heroes on a dangerous search for the Oasis of Ahm Shere, where Imhotep hopes to defeat the fabled Scorpion King (played mostly in CG by The Rock) and take control of the Army of Anubis.<br/><br/>Whew, that's a mouthful. The film has great action. A big fight scene in Rick's house, both upstairs and downstairs. A shoot-out in a museum. An exciting bus chase through the streets of London. A race between a tidal wave and a dirigible. An attack by strange-looking (and, ultimately, annoying) pygmy skeletons. A showdown between Imhotep and Rick, Jonathan and Anck Su Namun and then Evie and Anck Su Namun.<br/><br/>Definitely worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>However, the film had too many errors to warrant more than a five. Let's face it. Most movies had continuity errors (even ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") but this film goes way beyond normal. It's almost like no research was done for this film and the director just went for what he thought the world of 1933 would look like.<br/><br/>For example: <br/><br/>1) There's a woman-on-woman fight scene in ancient Egypt before Pharoah Seti I, featuring sai blades. Sai blades were not in Egypt, but were created in China during the Ming Dynasty, which did not come about until 1368.<br/><br/>2) Alex's slingshot wasn't made until 1954.<br/><br/>3) Jonathan breaks off a key in the ignition of Rick's limousine, yet ignition keys for cars didn't come around until 1949.<br/><br/>4) The double-decker bus Jonathan commandeers in London was not designed until 1954.<br/><br/>5) Izzy (Shaun Parks), pilot of the dirigible that takes Rick and Evie to Ahm Shere, uses a fire extinguisher that seems old but wasn't made until 1980.<br/><br/>6) Alex is supposed to be eight years old. The Three Stooges -- actually three schmucks (Bruce Byron, Joe Dixon, Tom Fisher) written in only to be cannon fodder for Imhotep's assimilation -- comment that the Black Book of the Dead meant death for the Yanks of the original film nine years earlier. Much of the original film was set in 1926, a mere 7(!!!) years earlier. Somehow, the script writers fixated on 1923, the year in which the original movie was begun (remember, after Rick's escape from Hamunaptra, the film advanced three years to 1926).<br/><br/>7) There are a few other major hits, but none worse than (possible spoiler) a massive fight between the 12 Tribes of the Medjai and Anubis' warrior army. The 12 tribes seem to have 10,000 men on horseback. After the first round of battle, they're whittled down to several hundred, but we see not one body -- of Medjai or horse nor will we. If the film was trying to capture the magnificence of ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" or even ""Spartacus,"" it failed horribly.<br/><br/>But, perhaps the most egregious problem is how the sequel screws up the events of the original film. In ""The Mummy Returns,"" Evie is presented as the physical and spiritual reincarnation of Nefertiri, daughter of Seti I. In the first film, however, Imhotep mistakes Evie for a reincarnation of Anck Su Namun. How could he have not recognized Nefertiri? In ""TMR,"" he doesn't seem to recognize her as Nefertiri either. In fact, Anck Su Namun doesn't recognize Evie as Nefertiri until almost the end of the film. What gives?<br/><br/>Also, at the end of the first film, when Imhotep sinks into the Well of Souls, he loses all the life he ripped from the Americans and the Egyptologist. We see his eyes and tongue go last. In ""TMR,"" he reawakens with eyes and a tongue.<br/><br/>Oh, well, maybe I'm being too harsh. Brendan Fraser was his usual cool self and Arnold Vosloo almost stole the show again. The Rock was not in the film enough (but was in ""The Scorpion King"" way too much). The fight scene between Rick and Imhotep was fantastic with its array of weapons. It was also nice to see Jonathan stop being a cowardly wuss and Alex did tone down the annoying ""mischievous kid"" act by the end of the film. Anck Su Namun was particular seductive and evil (see her first meeting with Alex), although I had a hard time believing how her (oops, spoiler potential)...demise was presented. It seemed suddenly out of character and forced. <br/><br/>So, just go with the flow on this on. Watch it for the action and try not to be too cerebral. For action flicks, thinking too much can hurt."

","The Mummy Returns takes place 9 years after the first film. Rick O'Connell and Evey Carnahan are now married with a 9 year-old son who enjoys exploring as much as they do. Evey has been having strange visions, and it leads her to the discovery of a bracelet that once belonged to the legendary Scorpion King. When her son accidentally puts it on, an evil cult kidnaps him to revive the Scorpion King. Meanwhile, they've already raised Imhotep from the grave once again, and it's up to the O'Connells and Evey's brother John to stop the mummy and find their son. This is a pretty fun popcorn movie, but it lacks the same charm the first film had.<br/><br/>The plot to this movie is okay, but it's just not the same as the first one. Too many ridiculous plot devices have been added to make the movie more meaningful, but it fails. For instance, we find out that Evey is a reincarnation of Nefirtiri, a rival of Anck Su Namun in ancient Egypt. This leads to a fight between Evey and a reincarnation of Anck Su Namun near the end of the movie. Wait...Where was this reincarnation of Anck Su Namun in the first film when he needed her? Whatever. There is an action scene involving a bunch of pygmy mummies, and it is one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie. The character of the Scorpion King was majorly hyped up in the trailers and through word of mouth, but the sad part is that The Rock appears as the Scorpion King for about 5 minutes at the beginning. The movie also uses a couple of the same scenes, such as pillars falling like dominoes instead of bookshelves, and a wall of water chasing a boat rather than a wall of sand chasing a plane. The special effects are terrible as well. The Scorpion King appears at the end of the movie as well, but as a CGI effect so bad, it looks like an N64 video game character.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the acting is just as good as the first film. Brandon Fraser and Rachel Weisz are great as a couple, and John Hannah is once again hilarious as Evey's brother. Arnold Vosloo plays the mummy once again, and does a good job, but sadly, due to everything else that's going on in the film, the mummy's return receives the least attention.<br/><br/>Overall this is a fun popcorn movie, but nowhere close to as good as the first movie.<br/><br/>6/10"
"FilmSchoolWriter","9","0","0","6 May 2006"," A fabulous ride! (And I'm talking about the movie, not the roller-coaster)
","I loved The Mummy so, of course, I had to see The Mummy Returns as well. At first, I was wary of seeing it. The majority of movie sequels crash and burn hopelessly, ruining the originals forever. Thankfully, The Mummy Returns returns doesn't do that! This is at least as good as it's predecessor. A few alarm bells went off in my head when I first started watching this movie, but none of them were necessary. When I first saw that Evie and Rick had a kid (Alex), I was like, ""Oh crap. This is going to suck."" But it didn't! Freddie Boath actually does a really good job playing Alex. He wasn't annoying and he never got in the way of the action. The part was well written and he executed it well.<br/><br/>Props to Stephen Sommers for bringing back his entire leading cast. The Mummy Returns wouldn't have been half as good if any of the characters had been recast. The ever spectacular Rachel Weisz once again does a wonderful job playing Evie. The same for Brendan Frasier. When I first saw The Mummy, I was really worried about having Frasier in an action/adventure role. Face it, the guy isn't exactly the most serious actor. But he rocks, no one else could have played Rick like he can. Oded Fehr is wonderful as Ardeth Bay. I'm really glad that they decided not to kill off his character at the end of The Mummy. But for me, John Hannah once again stole the show. I love him as Jonathan! In every scene he's in, I can't take my eyes off of him. He's incredibly entertaining - just like an actor should be.<br/><br/>Stephen Sommers is a great director. Granted, his films are exactly going to win the Oscar for Best Picture, but the visual effects really are stunning. His movies garb me and always entertain me, regardless.<br/><br/>So the moral of the story is, RENT THE MUMMY RETURNS! It's a fabulous ride and you won't regret it. A very solid 9/10."

This time, they are married and their son has been taken hostage by the newly raised Imotep (brilliantly portrayed by Arnold Vosloo).<br/><br/>It is filled with the clever repartee and the cartoonish fights that made the first movie so good.

"dcldan","7","0","0","14 February 2006"," Better than the first
","This time, Stephen Sommers has forgotten the terror to film a pure adventure film, in the same way as Indiana Jones, with exoticism, adventures, dangers, and of course, good sense of humour, all mixed with spectacular special effects. The reincarnation of Ank-sun-ammun awakes the Mummy again, Inmhotep must fight with the Scorpion King in order to command his army a nd conquer the world. In this way, he will be able to enjoy his life with his lover forever. Unfortunately, this will mean the end for humans, so the O'Conells have to stop him. With a great sense of humour and adventure it is better indeed than the previous part, better special effects, and less terror,which makes the film better. All actors are great (for this kind of film) specially Voosloo, who makes the Mummy the most charismatic character of the film. On the other hand, the charisma of the characters of inmhotep and Ank-sun-amun is greater than the time they have in the film, the director could have taken more profit of their spectacular and precious love story to make the film more enjoyable; this guides us to another question: If the Mummy only wanted to be with his lover, why should he do all this mess to command Anubis Army, could he simply stay happily with her?? The film is funny and enjoyable, despite some things (as said before) that could have been filmed better. Ideal for enjoy during 2 hours with one of the best modern classical adventures film."

The awful dialog takes an otherwise average movie and turns it into a positively awful one. The story is passable. The special effects are good, though the action scenes are a bit more derivative than the first. The main characters are terrible actors but that doesn't really matter in this genre. In sum, avoid this movie if you can and for certain do not pay to view it, but if you are stuck with nothing else on cable at 4:00 am, watch it with the sound off (you won't miss anything) and you should make it through relatively unscathed and with most of your remaining brain cells intact."

The special effects are bit overdone and the plot is about as complex as an episode of Mayberry RFD, but that doesn't detract from it's simple 80's action television show values. <br/><br/>Although one things my friend and I have noticed that seems to have escaped the notice of the IMDb trivia section, the ending of this movie is a play by play remake of the ending of the Ducktales mummy adventure. <br/><br/>1. Mummy is defeated in the strange desert oasis <br/><br/>2. the defeat of said villain causes said oasis to sink into the desert <br/><br/>3. a daring escape through the pyramid <br/><br/>4. escape culminates on the roof of the pyramid where our heroes are met by the pilot character in a hot air balloon <br/><br/>5. the greedy character reaches back for a large jewel, almost dies due to their greed, only to be pulled back from the brink of disaster by another character <br/><br/>6. happily ever after<br/><br/>even the sinking of the pyramid into the desert is shot in an identical manner. We even hooked up two TVs and watched them both at the same time. The timing is almost exact, and there are other similarities between the two that are too numerous to mention.

","I felt that they reached more of an audience with The Mummy Returns. They had the love from the marriage and then a little boy who is innocent and then the bad guys and the sword fights and all of that. I enjoyed it much more than the first one. The first one revolved around all of the freaky bugs that get under your skin and eat you alive. Its nasty. On the other hand however, in this film, you have fewer bugs which is good, and more sword play which was amazing. I like the part where after Rick throws the snake at the one guy and then another guy throws a knife at him. I love how he catches it and throws it back. Its sweet. I feel that when working in temps of 130*F +, that the actors did spectacular. The only thing they could have done better was the scene where Evelyn dies. She fell forward and then went back and should have been laying really weird but she ended up laying flat. That could have been for Rachel's comfort but honestly. But when she was stabbed the shock in her eyes and the pain and almost horror was really good. And her final words were done really well with the few last breaths in between. Amazing work. Honestly. They did a good job captivating the people who like love stories, and the people who like the fight scenes and the history buffs, and the people who feel for children, and the animal lovers (HORACE!! I LOVED HORACE!!), and everyone in between or that likes all of the above (like me). Overall, I thought it was well thought out and very moving and also very accurate to the language and such.

The movie's only redeeming quality is that Brendan Fraser is on the screen again. I guess my problem with this sequel like so many sequels is that the original was too good. The Original Mummy had the depth and the CG quality of a really great action film. The second mummy had the great base of the original mummy however it failed to take it to the next step. Actually it seemed to have gone down in quality. Here we have great characters (except a few) that have such quality to them but there is no real storyline. Once again the movie studio pushes a sequel too quickly without really putting any time into it.<br/><br/>But honestly I think I could suspend my disbelief except for one thing (trust me I would have put it on the goofs page if i thought it would stay) is that a couple who are obviously attracted to each other and are around each other all the time only have one kid. I mean I understand if there was a medical reason but seriously one kid I mean how much did they kiss a one week period.<br/><br/>But as for the rest of the movie it probably has already been pointed out that the cg was of such poor quality compared to the first movie and there were too many cliches.

Speaking of action, I don't think I've seen an adventure film packed with so many gunfights, chases, and gargantuan battle sequences.  That's sure to please some viewers, but the action is seriously hampered by Sommers occasional attempt to ape The Matrix (slow motion) and completely, blatantly defy the laws of physics (Fraser outruns the sun!).  The last forty minutes are horrendously silly (let's count down: there's a melodramatic death scene made twice as bad with reincarnation, a Matrix-style fight scene, and a big battle with a CGI Scorpion King and Anubis warriors that looks pretty ridiculous).

If you're a Brenden Fraser fan, check out The Mummy Returns, and it's predessesor! That's The Rock who played the Scorpion King, you can tell it's him the way he's been digitally enhanced.  Rick O'Connell puts Indiana Jones to shame! I give both Mummy movies 4 stars each!  I hope to see both Brenden Fraser and Rachel Weisz in more movies in the future!"

","Even if the stars do a great job, the action is definitely the biggest star in this film, as in the others in the series, and therefore the story has it faults. But if you go for a rollercoaster ride, do you expect subtlety? I hope not, and with that in mind, a lot can be forgiven in this kind of movie, but some things just plain bug me. Like how ** SPOILER WARNING** Anck-su-namun would leave her beloved because she is afraid of a little raining stone! This girl killed a god (or at least a man perceived as one) for Imhotep, and she has already been brought back to life, still she freezes in fear while our brave (and beautiful) Rachel Weizs races to the rescue. **SPOILER END** And most times we are going directly from the one big action scene to the other, without any pause or development of plot. Mostly because of the lack of it. Still, the film could be really good for what it is attempting, cut the brakes and full gas and all that stuff, but then at least they should have gotten the special-effects right so the scorpion king didn`t look like a plastic doll. Back to the rollercoaster example. It is often the slow ride before you plunge, where you hold the breath and wait in excitement that makes the moment, but here you just keep on going downwards from the cool beginning to the more and more excruciating ending."

I also enjoyed the Rock's cameo at the beginning of the film.  Too bad they screwed it up with bad CGI at the end of the film.

It appeared people were as excited and curious as I was.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns presents us with the return of our favorite characters, or not-so-favorite if you had questionable thoughts about the first.  It is overdone on the CGI all throughout, and even a little child would be able to notice the created waterfall.

There are some other great ones out there, but if you've been very depressed with the recent craptastic movies that have been released (Crocodile Dundee III) then I'd say you need to redeem your money's worth from that theatre and go see Mummy Returns."

I have seen better animation in video games and the Scorpion King animation reminded me of something out of the old Sinbad movies.  No knock on Sinbad but this movie has every advantage and squandered them.  It was obviously an attempt by a big movie studio to make a quick buck before the looming writers' strike (which, thankfully, didn't happen).  The only redeeming quality of this movie was the sound.  It was second to none but sound alone cannot make a movie.  I loved the first movie in the series but this one was a total bomb.

","In love with the first ""Mummy,"" I began losing my enthusiasm for the sequel when the previews failed to really interest me. The movie looked like it would focus on re-using the good parts from the first movie. (The face in the sand, the scary mummy guards, etc). For the most part, that is what has happened in ""The Mummy Returns."" The story lacks cohesiveness. I felt dizzy going from Egypt to London and back to Egypt. And while I know the third movie is to be about the Scorpion King, the Scorpion King's role in ""The Mummy Returns"" seems very forced and out of place. The sparks that flew between Fraser and Weisz in the first movie are nearly dead as the two adventurers are now married with child. All in all, this movie could have been a lot better, but it is worth seeing (special effects) if you enjoyed the first."
"alderson","2","0","0","4 May 2001"," Too many problems to count
","I had so many problems with this movie, I don't know where to begin.  Let me say that I am a fan of The Mummy (1999)... it's definitely a guilty pleasure.  That movie had a good plot, a good build up to the ""reveal"" of the mummy, hilarious one liners (""It's still... juicy""), and fun action sequences.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns doesn't have any of that.  We see the first supernatural beings about thirty seconds into the movie (the sand-doggies), and the first mummies about two minutes later.  And they're the same soldier mummies from the first movie.  Sigh.<br/><br/>The action is so relentless that it gets boring, and rarely leaves time for any dialog at all, let alone anything funny.  The plot is rather painfully contrived, and not much is explained.  The romance between Evie and O'Connell is just plain sappy (""Cue violins... now kiss!"" got old after the 4th or 5th time, thanks), and loses the spark their relationship had in the first movie.<br/><br/>And you know, I could suspend my disbelief about the whole supernatural ancient egyptian magic thing; after all, it's rather essential to the central theme of the movie.  I *refused* to suspend my disbelief about the hot air balloon with after burners.  That was just plain stupid.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the horridly inconsistent CGI work.  It was VERY bad at times, to the point of it looking like a video game.  The Rock as the scorpion king (at the end) looked so jarringly fake that I wanted to run far away from this film.  They must have just painted The Rock's face onto a CGI model, and it showed.  Mr. Potato Head from Toy Story had more emotion in his facial expressions.<br/><br/>Oh well, this movie will make its millions.  But it doesn't deserve it.<br/><br/>-John"

","Every year, around this time, I always start to get a little giddy.  I'm always so excited to see summer roll around, so I can watch those guys at ILM have their fun, trying to outdo what they did last go round.  Each year, summer movies seem to get more and more computerized, and less entertaining. After watching The Mummy Returns, I feel the trend will continue.  Make no mistake, the film is an action ride from beginning to end, but not once is it truly a FUN ride.   <br/><br/>I was really pumped to see this film.  I mean REALLY pumped.  I don't even know why.  Granted, I liked the first Mummy film, but not that much.  All I talked about for the past two weeks was seeing this movie.  I don't even know why...I just did.  My friend even made some off color sexual remarks about the Mummy and I.  Yes, it was that bad.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised I was disappointed.  I had it coming.<br/><br/>What hurt the film the most was too much action.  I love thrills and chills and yadda yadda...but it was too much.  The film had formula written all over it. Too many characters, too little development, jumping from one death defying circumstance to another.  The CGI was good, but way overdone.  I miss the days where characters actually got the chance to interact with one another.  So darn much of the film felt incredibly fake.  It was more like watching a video game.  Apparently, they forgot to actually write the thing. I got a feeling Sommers and crew just sat around thinking of things that would LOOK cool in a movie.  I think some of the ideas were jokes that somehow got scripted in by accident.  Some of it worked great, but other scenes just made me want to laugh...and not when I was supposed to, either. Granted, the film is supposed to be a comic book fantasy film, but we're not idiots.  We won't watch anything.  Then again, I was there day one and many were there with me...so maybe we will.<br/><br/>As far as the cast goes, I can't really blame them.  Each did their job and did it well.  It was good to see everyone back for a second go round, and I still like the characters.  Fraser, Weisz, Hannah, and Fehr did a great job. Freddie Boath didn't grate my nerves like I thought he would (*cough-Jake LLoyd-cough*) and was actually pretty funny.  BUT...the Scorpion King, portrayed by The Rock. WHAT?!?  What is the big deal?  How can ""Hollywood"" determine if this guy is the next big action star...he's in the film for all of 5 minutes, and had like three lines of gibberish?  I mean, I'll give the guy a chance, but to give him a prequel based on his performance here is just silly.  <br/><br/>So, even as I bash the film, it filled the time and I am in total LOVE with Patricia Velazquez, so I'd give it a 7 out of 10.  Yeah, I'm a bit of a hypocrite, so what?  $7 bucks isn't too much to pay for a couple hours of watching the most beautiful female on the planet."

","To start off, let me just say that I was a HUGE fan of the first film.  It was smart, funny, and action packed.  Unquestionably one of the best films in the genre since they stopped making Indiana Jones flicks.  The Mummy Returns, while containing wall to wall action and some definitely cool fight sequences, lacks the feel of the original.  The movie tries desperately to recapture the fun of the original, and falls miserably on it's face.  I remember the first movie being very funny, and never taking itself too seriously.  I laughed probably 3 times in this movie, and the rest of the jokes were incredibly corny 1 liners that no one in the theater over the age of 12 laughed at.  I'm not gonna blame it on the kid, like many others are doing, because there is far more wrong with this movie than him.  In fact, I'm not going to blame it on any of the actors.  I usually really like Brendan Fraser (And if I liked Dudley Do-Right, I'll like him in anything) but he really didn't have much to work with here.  And if you're a WWF fan going to see the movie debut of the Rock, then do yourself a favor and get up and leave 10 minutes into the movie, because he doesn't come back (The character does at the end, but he's completely computer generated). The film just goes from one ridiculously unbelievable adventure to the next, no time to breathe, no time to actually stop and develop the story into something remotely interesting.  This movie was obviously rushed into production from the moment the first film became a hit, and if they had just taken half as much time polishing the script as they did filling it up with special effects (varying in range from spectacular to extremely fake looking) then it would have been a much better film.  As it stands, it's little more than two hours of pretty scenery, with not much else to keep your interest. Grade: C-"

","I have to admit that I did have high expectations for this film.  Usually, when a sequel comes out I just expect it to entertain with no real original value.  After all, sequels mostly are just rip-offs of the first film, recycling all that worked in the initial installment to continue a franchise that's story was finished in the first movie.  But, after seeing the trailers for THE MUMMY RETURNS, I thought this might actually be a good film.  A sequel that wouldn't disappoint the fans of the first one. Needless to say, it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The first MUMMY movie was a fun ride, with all it's Indiana Jones like action and story.  And THE MUMMY RETURNS is just as fun, if not more so. This story is a lot like the first one, but here I felt there was more backstory, more humor, and more chemistry between the main male and female characters than in the original.  Even the villains seem more entertaining than before.  Of course, the Mummy returns (duh), but another evil character called The Scorpion King, played convincingly and too briefly by The Rock, gives an added bonus character to cheer for and against. <br/><br/>
The action is all here as well.  Whether it is in the desert, or in the jungle, or in the middle of town, the action is non-stop.  And the effects work well with the story rather than being the basis for the story. Thankfully, the special effects are used as a tool to move the film along instead of just being eye candy.  <br/><br/>THE MUMMY RETURNS might not be one that will end up on any critics top ten list for the year, but it is one of the best action movies of the year so far.  Go check it out!"

","I feel a little cheated. I am a big fan of the 1999 Mummy and have seen it close to 25 times. It was not an Oscar worthy movie by any means but it just ""clicked"". The dialog was good (and humorous), the story line interesting, the action exciting and the characters worked well together. The chemistry between Brendan and Rachel was good. Now, as for the sequel, well, I was a bit disappointed. Gone was the chemistry between the two main characters; the dialog was not as good or as important to the storyline which was going in too many directions; and too many extraneous characters were added. More time and money was obviously spent on special effects. The storyline of the reincarnation of Evie was a good twist, but it was much more fun to hate one bad Mummy in the first movie than to worry about 2 bad guys here. Lastly, I am wondering why they are promoting The Rock so much for this movie when he was on screen for all of about 10 minutes, and yes, I do know they are working on THAT movie now. As a summer action flick, it delivers, but for those of us seeking the same ""charm"" of the first movie, I came away feeling empty."

It does suffer from ""sequel-itis"" to some extent, but that's not a problem when you look at all the awesome special effects, hilarious comedy, and excellent fight sequences.<br/><br/>Sure, it lacks the suspense it seems to be going for and many of the plot turns are simply stupid, but anyone should be able to tell that this 21st century rendition of the classic story of ""The Mummy"" is one that comes with a lot of farce.  I liked being able to predict certain things because it made me feel so comfortable that I didn't expect the other things coming. And sure, some of the stuff was so stupid that you had to slap your forehead and shake your head in disdain, but do you think that Stephen Sommers made this film with the intent of winning an Oscar or something?  Maybe making a buttload of money yes, but you've gotta give some credits to the sell-outs out there who can make money and be extremely entertaining at the same time!<br/><br/>I thought that the whole thing had this sort of old-fashioned style to it, like an old serial from the thirties, i.e. Captain Marvel or Batman.  It was kind of like this really cool western that utilized some really funny cliches that nobody's seen for a while.  Specifically, I think I'm talking about some of the scenes involving the Magi.  Then there were other scenes that were a lot like Star Wars Episode 1 when JarJar's people are fighting the droids.  This film just came together to use a lot of old techniques and themes that work really well and kept me entertained throughout.<br/><br/>It's a great starter for the summer season.  Makes me feel more optimistic about what's to come, probably because all the awesome trailers that came before the feature.

Rachel Weisz is ok as are the villains, but it's all so over the top and at times so overbearingly cutesy that you cannot help but to wish for Hollywood to release a real film sometime.

","Somewhere in Hollywood, some guy made a pitch that goes like this: ""Mummy was such a blockbuster hit!  But we need to get the 5-12 year old crowd in order to sell all these action figures and lunch boxes.  Lets do another Mummy Movie:  Home Alone meets Indiana Jones!  A wise-cracking kid will fend off evil mummies while his worried archeaologist parents try to find him before the end of the world happens.""<br/><br/>This film had some good moments, don't get me wrong.  I liked the pygmy scene, and the flashbacks to ancient Egypt.  Those were great.  But what was up with the constant making out between the O'Connells after every ""rescue""? Come on, they've been married like 10 years or something...the flame is gone!  Its a good thing Alex was with Ihmoutep or he would have probably said ""Get a room, Mom and Dad!"" Lets face it, Home Alone meets Indiana Jones didn't work in Star Wars Episode I (which was worse) and it doesn't work here!<br/><br/>

","The Mummy, released in 1999, was a surprisingly enjoyable movie. A spoof of the old movie serials, it took the old classic and actually did something new and different with it. While no masterpiece, it had wit, fun character portrayals, and took its liesurly time in telling its story, using great special effects judiciously. It was really a movie to make you smile, yet ahead its share of ""horror"" and gross outs. <br/><br/>The Mummy Returns has little of any of this, and what it does have is completely buried in the relentless barrage of special effects and earsplitting noise. Never did I imagine they could a movie more loud and obnoxious than Armegeddon or The Matrix, but they have succeeded in doing so.  The visuals are often stunning, but there is too much, and too little of everything else. For all the action, this movie is very boring. There is a story, but its hard to even pay attention to it with all the sensory overload. Brendon Fraser himself pretty much drowns in the mess, and the Mummy himself, central and rather charming in the original, is a mere decoration here. And of course they add a kid to propel the story. The best I can say is he is not as obnoxious as most movie kids.<br/><br/>Of course, since louder, brasher and faster seems to by synomomous with quality, audiences will love it. What really mystifies me is how some critics, who are supposedly sophisticated and knowledgeable about movies, can consider this superior to the original, or even more inexplicable, the critics who don't see the difference between the two, either liking both or not liking both. <br/><br/>As for the criticism, ""Hey its just a fun movie - not Shakespeare"" - well The Mummy wasn't Shakespeare either, it was mindless but fun.

","The Mummy Returns is a true Hollywood blockbuster.  Big stars (if you can call Brendan Fraser that), tons of special effects, large-scale battle scenes and non-stop action.  This is one of those movies that is just fun to watch.  There is no real depth to it and what little character development there is seems ridiculous.  But don't worry, you won't have time to think about these things for too long, because before you know it people are getting shot at, chased by giant tidal waves, and attacked by one or more of the following: mummies, giant dog warriors, bugs, pigmies, mysterious bad guys, half-man half-scorpion creature.  One might even say that there is too much action, that is if there was such a thing as too much action (I assure you there isn't).  In fact it's the action sequences that make the mummy so great.  There are lots of John Woo style gunfights, Gladiator style fight sequences and Matrix like action.  The plot finds Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz this time trying to save their son from the mummy who has been resurrected to fight an ancient warrior known as the Scorpion King, portrayed in a cameo by The Rock, and take over the world (you know the drill).  As entertaining as this all was I have to say I liked the 1999 original better.  One of the major problems with this film was the same special effects over kill that destroyed SW: Episode 1.  There are times when literally everything on he screen is computer animated.  I mean, I like CGI but when it gets to the point were everyone looks like a cartoon, enough is enough.  The film also suffers from unoriginality, ripping off everything from Indiana Jones to Jurassic Park to the first Mummy.  Nevertheless it was fun (I can't stress that enough) and since Hollywood is built on ripping others off I can forgive them for that.  So go see it, it's not the best film of the year but where else can you see a 40 foot tidal wave chase a rocket powered balloon through canyon walls."

Brendan Fraser did an exeptanial job and it completly cut out for the role.Brendan did an exeptinal job fighting the air tha was soon replaced with computer effects!Rachel Wiesze was also great!She and anucksunamun were awsome in all or there fighting sceens.The veisual effects , plot ,and charecters were all spactacular and should come back for another movie.The actor who played anucksunamun was great in the kissing sceen in wich she was kissing the almost disinagrated mummy.I dont even want to know if she had to kiss the air or another person and they replaced it with an effect or what.(I prefer it that way) It was great I was on the edge of my seet the entire time and when I left the theter I was gasping for air.The sequel was more action packed more fun and just plain supreme.All these other reviews I hav seen are bagging on the movie and truly what movie did THEY see ??? It was superb and all I can say is bring another.I can only expect it to be 40 times better than the first and second combined!!!All in all it was the best movie all summer lond and I have it at home to wach for the rest of my life!!"

","There was a point during the second hour of this movie when the action stopped for five minutes. During this time I had time to sit back and take in what I had been watching. Exhilarating, edge-of-the-seat action for over an hour, but why? What was happening? Why was it happening?<br/><br/>Who knows? Who cares? The best way to describe this film is as a movie version of a rollercoaster. You know you should hate it but for some reason you strangely enjoy it."

","I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the movie on DVD (couldn't catch it at the cinema).  The beginning scenes featuring The Scorpion King (a new movie coming out in 2002) did a nice job of showing that this guy could be worse than The Mummy.  I feel that The Mummy Returns excels in showing the connection between the current characters and their Egyptian counterparts. I frankly don't understand the criticism of saying their was NO STORY or the STORY WAS BAD.  Where?  The story is simple and easy to understand.  Does that constitute as BAD.  No it does not.  The action, well that's an understatement.  There's enough quality action to satisfy the hungriest fans.  I found no bad performances in this movie (well the little boy could be a little irritating but what little boys aren't).  Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo stand out.  Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lock-Nah) looked like a throwback to the old Spartacas (sp?) type movie characters. Just a quality follow-up to a great movie.  I hope ""The Scorpion King"" lives up to ""The Mummies"".  Can't do wrong buying the DVD.<br/><br/>There is WAY TO MUCH over-analyzation in the bad comments about this movie. This isn't ""The Godfather""."

","Had it not been for my anger and annoyance with the constant use of computer graphics that often looked subpar and ridiculous, The Mummy Returns would have put me into a deep sleep for a couple thousand years.<br/><br/>There are so many poor aspects of the film, but to start, I will not mention The Rock as a star.  That's because he has a 5-minute cameo (and 5 minutes is stretching it) in the beginning and then returns in the last 10 minutes of the movie as a CGI monstrosity that looks like the latest Gameboy WWF Raw! installment.  Trailers would have us believe he is a major part of the film, and he is: he will get lots of ignorant moviegoers to shell out the bucks.<br/><br/>Mummy brings back the characters from the previous flick for more mindless action along with an annoying child.  They travel through Egypt and London attempting to stop the evil mummy Imhotep from taking over the world (I think) as well as the Scorpion King from attempting to do the same (I think).  <br/><br/>Director Stephen Sommers is congratulated for giving us the first special-effects-ridden, mindnumbing, corny, deafening Hollywood monstrosities of the summer.   While Mummy Returns certainly contains more action than its predecessor, it also has the same corny one-liners, stupid, illogical characters, muted violence, and shameless visuals from the first. It forgets to do what a worthwhile movie does: give us a good story and memorable characters.  <br/><br/>The Mummy Returns is not only the same clumsy retread that The Mummy was, it's also a testament to Hollywood's extraneous dependence on budget and CGI to characters and screenwriting.  And judging from the millions it'll rake in, it's also a sad commentary on audiences' intelligence.<br/><br/>3 out of 10"

","Having enjoyed the first ""Mummy"" immensely, I was eager to sit down for the sequel which I'd read (here) and heard was as good as the original. Now I have to wonder what movie those people saw! The first mummy was far superior to me in story line, the chemistry between the main characters was spicy and fun, and the dialogue a hoot! The sequel? I didn't know who these people were! I know they're 8 years older and have a child and was willing to accept that suspension of belief , but I never found that comfortable comradarie so evident in the first. I never could LIKE the characters in the sequel. Evies gone from a mild librarian with a hankering for adventure to a bigger swashbuckler than her hubby! If Zena was still on the air she should audition! I have<br/><br/>never seen such a switch-8 years or not. And if she and her hubby would have come up for air occasionally they might have noticed how many times their kid was about to get popped. On the other hand, maybe they didn't care being that the child was irritating and wooden and spouting adult cynicisms with a British accent. Did he spend more time with Mom I guess? The Scorpion King could have had them all for what I cared. While the special effects were impressive (and a lot more to the point of being overwhelming) it was clear to me thats where all the money was spent and not on the writing. Newsflash guys-sometimes less is better!"

","Because no matter how sore my frontal intellect lobes were, or the sorry state of my insulted reasoning in forming realistic maniacism, you've gotta give it up to Stephen ""Indian"" Sommers for pumping out an unbelievable success story.  His two Mummy movies put out as threateningly terrific marketeering ploys of sucking out America's millions under the front of an effervescent little action movie.<br/><br/>Mummy 1 was incredibly fun, no matter how the more pompous of the deployed critic army had hailed otherwise.  It was a great resurrection of the light-hearted comedy farce centered around historical trumps from the same gene pool as Indiana Jones.  (Or else a determined remake justified through better available special-effects/face-lift technology.)  And it worked.  We had a laugh.  Universal made some money.  And life went on.<br/><br/>But there is something fishy about Mummy 2.  A little TOO eager to please, this sequel.  More like a specifically precisioned beast of translucence based on randomly selected telephone surveys to anonymous people about what the studio needs to do to get a rise out of & get this potential movie goer to see this thing on opening day.  Obviously that Oded Fehr guy was a big hit with the ladies, since he had a bucketful of these Fabioesque, heartthrob man-meat promo shots for tall dark and handsome Arabian GQ. They porked it up with flashbacks of that ever-clichÃ© Ancient Egypt gold chantilly Renaissance paradise, as well as fight scenes with sci-fi creations of an obvious 3D computer-generated quality.<br/><br/>It WAS pretty.  But it was also pretty confusing and pretty ugly in the IQ department.  You can almost see this thing being written for the theater reaction -- where swashbuckler searches in dank cave but finds nothing, then a loud boom accompanies the ""turn around and find ogre breathing down your back"" scare tactic.  (Insert popcorn flying towards ceiling here.) Although, the Virilliant Vosloo not only looks believable as a 21st Century Boris Karloff, he's a good sport with stage directions that must have looked humiliating in real time AND he milked some sympathy out of the audience at the end by shedding a few trick tears...dare I say triple threat?  Dennis the Menace had at least some sort of listless command, and the end was on the brink of sheer excitement.<br/><br/>But like a drunk girl, Mummy 2 was just too goddamn easy.  No sport in watching it take any chances...just another air-headed run around."

","I was not a big fan of the first one. However, when I saw the trailer for the sequel I was enticed.  I am now not a big fan of the sequel.<br/><br/>  It showed so much promise with its spectacled scenes.  The characters are comical and a wee bit Spielburgian.  The film is fun for the most part and the array of creatures that pop up here and there are an animators delight. <br/><br/>
But, the film crashes toward the end.  It was as if the writer was replaced at the end and they brought someone in to create an a quick finale. <br/><br/>
The film sets up for battles we can not wait to see only to be disappointed after they are fought.  I was excited to see the rematch between the two female leads but what a downer.  <br/><br/>It is neat to compare a filmed fight such as the one in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" to this one.  One can see how one director is superior to the other.  The Mummy's fight scenes are noticeably computer enhanced whereas the weapon fight between the ""Tiger/Dragon's"" women is beautifully shot and choreographed.  The same direction is needed for a film of such grandeur.<br/><br/>
When the Pharaoh loses his powers all of the sudden I felt cheated.  The Scorpion King was weak along with the silly battle with Frasier.  However, if I were a kid I would thoroughly enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps Ang Lee could direct the third installment."

Mr. Sommers should stick with scriptwriting or whatever he was doing before the studio put him in charge of this overambitious two hour plus torture session to save himself from further embarrassing himself and his family anymore than he already has. I also would like to express my sincerest wish that this film ends ""The Mummy"" series because ""The Scorpion King"" is obviously going in a different Schwarzeneggeresque direction and can't really be called a sequel to this tripe.

I don't think this movie was made to follow the excellent first entry.  This one was made to make money, and to spend money.

Okay, so that is all good, but nothing too great.<br/><br/>This film floods the audiences eyes with scene after scene of Computered created images in almost every frame.  From mummies, to piggmies, to a giant Scorpion/Man thing that looks really really bad.  I know they probably spent alot on the effect, but it wasn't pulled off to great. <br/><br/>
Weighing too heavy on the shoulders of Sensationalism, this movie can't compete with the first on any level except the effects.  The character of Imothep is almost wasted--he isn't nearly has evil as in the first. <br/><br/>I also found plothole after plothole:  Where did Ank-su Namn come from?  Why was the Mummy in that cocoon?  who were these people that brought him back? If Evie was the descendant of the Pharoaphs daughter, then why didn't Imothep notice this in the first one?  Why would he be trying to kill her to bring his lover back to life--Through her?  Alot goes unanswered in this movie.

","What a fabulous job these movie makers have done in continuing the ancient story of fighting Egyptian Evil in The Mummy Returns! Stephen Sommers story is terrific, picking up just where we'd like to see the couple, Rick & Evie O'Connell and their son.  It reminded me a lot of the Indiana Jones adventures, the Romanticism was fantastic, and I don't just mean the cute love scenes with Brendan & Rachel.  Some of the beauty and scope covered by the cameras was just amazing.  Tying in the strong love the couple has for one another and their ancient pasts to their adventures supports the storyline in a most delightful way.  I found this one to be more fun than the first, it was much grander with a lot more special effects.  Although they may have gotten a bit out of hand with the Matrix-like jumps and kicks, they were not overdone overall, in my opinion, and I especially found the spiraling spear camera shot enjoyable.  The excitement the effects provided was very redeeming.  I also think there was less characterization in this second part, but with more story to replace it.

The charm of the original, which came from the relationship of its characters, and was its strongpoint, is gone, in favor of overwrought computer generated special effects.  The film is almost exclusively action sequences; one after the other. The original's cast is back, and that helps defray the onslaught of action; but this sequel is about half as good as the original.

It was fun and focused, so it was inevitable that a sequel would be put into production.  No big deal, the first one was good, second one should be as well, right? Wrong.<br/><br/>Writer/director Stephen Sommers packs this film with so much action that I actually got bored with watching it.  He never spends enough time on anything for the viewer to focus on.  One explosion, a few semi-funny one-liners, and on to the next scene.  Arnold Vosloo as The Mummy is back, but unfortunately, this isn't his movie.  Yes, he's in most of it, but I don't actually remember much of him beyond the canyon wave (essentially the sand face from the first film, only with water).  This film belongs to the Scorpion King, which brings me to him...<br/><br/>As far as The Rock as the Scorpion King go, what's the big deal?  For the few minutes he's in it (and I emphasize few minutes), he's either snarling and fighting, or he's snarling and running, or he's snarling as a very badly computer generated scorpion.  I'm wondering if Sommers just ran out of money, or perhaps energy when it came to completing the film, because the effects in the last 15 minutes are really horrible.  <br/><br/>There are good parts though.  The canine warriors are spectacular, and the little tiny mummy creatures are campy, but hilarious.  Plot?  Forgetaboutit. There is not plot to speak of.  Actually, to be honest, I can't even remember what the plot was to have supposed to involve beyond another little thing-a-ma-jig that would bring the Scorpion King back from the dead, and the reincarnated Anck Su Namun still trying to reunite herself with good 'ole Imhotep. Oh, and Brenden Fraser and Rachel Weisz are now married with a kid (the Action Movie Guide Book says it's better to involve children in those perilous situations for more suspense).<br/><br/>Now, come to find out, Universal is in production on a movie based solely on the Scorpion King.  I certainly hope that they find a plot, invest more in some special effects, and let The Rock get his snarl back in practice, because I'm sure the critics are already practicing theirs.<br/><br/>My grade: C-"

The Mummy Returns features ""The Scorpion King"" who was the greatest worrier of his time.  After he died he was said to rise 5000 years later and rule the world with his army.  The movie starts in the 1930s, hence the year of the Scorpion King.  So a bunch of guys(including the reincarnated Anck-Su-Namun, Decide to bring back Im-Ho-Tep to fight the scorpion king and when he does, he will take command of his army and rule the world. ( It's always that ""Take-Over-The-World ploy"") Well as you guessed Rick O'Connell and his wife Evelyn 'Evie' O'Connell, have different plans.   They set out with their son, Evie's brother, and one of the leaders of the Majai ""Ardeth Bay"", to stop the evil Mummy as well as the Scorpion King.  There are lots and lots of plot twists, and awesome graphics!  One thing you had in this Mummy that you didn't in the one before is the relationship between Rick and Evie. In the first one they hated each other and it made for some good humor watching these two duke it out while working together. However, their young son, and Evie's Brother have great roles..and portray them perfectly.  The thing I really liked is the way Alex (Rick and Evie's son) is so bold that he stand up to the main bad guy and basically puts him through hell. He even tells the Mummy himself ""My Dad Is Going To Kick Your..."" (Lets not finish that) it's funnier when you see the little kid do it anyway. This was an all-around great movie. The only thing that bothered me was how they stated that ""Reincarnation"" is a fact, and the way they ""Summoned"" the dead. All pretty demonic. But, if you can get past that, and know that it's just a movie...you'll enjoy yourself. 9 outta 10."

","Ok people.  I loved the original and I loved the sequel.  Why?  Was this Oscar caliber material?  NO!  NO!  NO!  This was a fun summer movie!  You wait until fall/spring for the real Oscar contenders.  This is the summer. Time to kick back and relax.  Go to the movies and CHILL OUT!  As I said in the heading.  Grab some popcorn and a coke and (in my case) an understanding date.  The understanding date shall be explained later.<br/><br/>I am an egyptology buff.  Was I stunned and appalled at the work done here? NO!  NO!  NO!  It is good mythology.  May not be a real occurance in the mythology of ancient Egypt, but it could have very well been.  There are many interesting myths and legends connected with that culture.  This fits in.  It uses a real god (Anubis)and has a fair understanding of the ancient afterlife beliefs.  For a summer movie, good enough for me.  Now if they said Apollo (a Greek god) comes riding through the desert in a chariot, then I'd have been put out!<br/><br/>The writing was not as up to par as with the last movie.  The original was somewhat funnier in certain aspects.  And some of the CGI was not that great.  But look beyond that nit picking and you have a great movie here. Lots of fun.  They fixed my 2 main problems with the last movie:  Wimpy chicks and not enough Oded Fehr.  Evelyn has grown into her own woman, she is smart and brave.  And Meela/Anuck (well, you know who I am referring to)had a meatier part.  Both of the actresses were very good.  And I was motivated to pick up sai fighting myself if I could do that stuff!  And Oded.  Well, this is where the understanding date comes in.  I was ooohhhing and ahhhhing and squealing and screaming for his Ardeth Bay the whole film. He had much more script and (sigh) that fight scene with the Anubis warriors at the climax was incredible.  He is soooooo talented and a damn good looking man. They should give Ardeth his own film.  A nude scene would only help (just kidding, sort of).  What I wouldn't give to be in the saddle with Ardeth, hearing him yell ""Yallah, imshe""!!  You ladies know you were thinking the same thing, don't lie to me!!  Oh dear, but I digress.  So, to summarize:  Oded Fehr =  WONDERFUL!  Brendan Fraser is really a good actor, but his character was much more utilized last film.  I still like the guy though, I mean it is Brendan Fraser.  John Hannah is the funniest man ever! I adore the dry Brit humor.  Vosloo is also a striking man and plays his evil character really well.  The Rock is well, he was there for 2 seconds and look mighty good in the loin cloth.  I can't comment on his acting abilities because to be honest, I have yet to see any real acting.  He was on screen for 2 minutes.  Not worth all that hype.  I say wait to hand down judgement until the Scorpian King comes out.  The man who played Lok-nah was very good.  Scared the hell out of me, but I have to say he is awful cute too.  Though, he lost points with me for trying to hurt Ardeth.  And Freddie Boath (Alex) was alright.  To be honest, he is Evie and Rick's son for sure with his ways.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't think it is even fair to compare this to Star Wars or Indie.  Come on people.  Just roll to the theater (brain optional) and have a little bit of fun.  I love the Mummy Returns.  It was great and I enjoyed myself.  Isn't that what a good summer movie is suppose to do?  YES!  YES! YES!"

","I cannot believe that there are those that believe this movie is better than the first.  This movie pales in comparison.  The special effects are done well (with the exception of the Scorpion King's phony appearance), but unfortunately this seems to be the only element of the film that lives up to the original.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns endeavors to include witty comic relief, like that of its predecessor, but fails miserably in its attempt.  The humor is forced and is used all too often.  Sure there are a lot of laughs in this film, however they come unintentionally from the ridiculous story and outlandish elements of the film (I particularly found the balloon they traveled in hilarious). Romantic scenes are inserted in the same way and just feel out of place. Of course, the gesture to kiss is the cue for the next action sequence, every time.<br/><br/>A big mistake was involving a son as part of the family.  Though his acting was decent the character was just annoying.  Being eight years old many of his reactions to situations were unrealistic, for instance he smart mouthed to people that could have easily killed him.  The scenes where he was creating sand models so that he could be followed was laughable.  Why didn't he just write the location of where to go instead of creating miniature sculptures of the places?  He can read ancient Egyptian but he couldn't think to just write the names of the places-smarter than his mother indeed.<br/><br/>Following a movie that was for the most part very good, it is too bad that this film was not better made.

","There was nothing good about 'The Mummy Returns'. The original mummy was a travesty, and I'm not sure what compelled me to see the sequel, but I can safely say that it made the first one look like Ben Hur.<br/><br/>
First of all, the plot. I won't go into detail so as to avoid a spoiler, but suffice to say that there was no REASON to any of it. Watch the movie again and ask yourself 'wait, WHY was the scorpion king under this strange and pointless list of restrictions/rules?' There IS  no reason. It was so contrived that within the first five minutes I was already hating it. The behavior of the characters was pointless and absurd (I mean, we watch the villian of the first movie succeed in EVERY goal he was twarted from in this film, so what exactly were they wasting their time with in the first movie?).<br/><br/>The acting? Sorry brandon, you make a fine monkey man, and a terrific innocent loser, but when it comes to swashbuckling action hero, nope, doesn't cut it. As for Weisz, well, she wasn't even trying. Finally, we have that wretched precoscious kid, who would have ruined the movie had it been at all tolerable to begin with.<br/><br/>Holes in the plot? Never mind the myriad historical inaccuracies (which we all just learned to stomach years ago), lets ask ourselfs what kind of cop out writer would have our heros smashed down hundreds of feet to a jungle floor by a towering wave of water and then, without explanation, have them alive and not even bruised? I'll tell you what kind of writer. A very lazy and sloppy writer who was getting paid, knew people would watch the stupid movie anyway, and didn't care. That's what kind.<br/><br/>Now, you can say 'oh, it had good special effects'. First of all, the special effects were second rate. Second of all, they ALL have good special effects these days. If that's your criteria for seeing a movie, then you must be in absolute heaven right about now. Me, I demand they put some WORK into it, and give me a well written story, some people who are TRYING to act, and someone who can write. I mean, if you don't want those things, stay home and watch FOX.<br/><br/>If you go to see this movie, you have no one to blame but yourself and stephen Sommers, whose movies I shall happily avoid in the future."

"heybrakywacky","5","0","0","18 July 2001"," Not surprisingly, this falls short of the first movie.
","Unfortunately, this movie was what I expected it to be, going into it.  Like The Mummy, this movie has really great special effects.  But what it lacks is the quirkiness, campiness, character interplay, and overall energy that the first movie has.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns, like its predecessor, has the theme of grave danger to the world in the awakening of an immortal, evil power.  But this time, the evil power is that of the Scorpion King, and at his command, the evil army of Anubis.  Whosoever can best the Scorpion King in battle will gain control of his armies, and subsequently world domination.<br/><br/>But that's the problem here.  We have this all-powerful enemy with his armies to contend with.  In addition, there is the evil group of people who resurrect high priest Imhotep, with the idea that he will defeat the Scorpion King and thus take over the world.  And intertwined through the whole mess is our band of heroes, who are consigned to thwarting these efforts, but who throughout the movie seem merely resigned to do so, without any of the sense of urgency that should surround such an undertaking. Indeed, Brendan Frasier's character makes a couple of comments to that effect: ""You know, a year ago, this would have completely freaked me out."" In this installment, the villains don't really seem all that immortal or all-powerful.  In spite of whatever powers they may wield, they're presented as not much more than another enemy to thwart.  It doesn't help that Imhotep is presented as being in collusion with all of these ""mortals.""  Come on! In the first movie, we get this presentation of Imhotep as this all-powerful force to be reckoned with, someone who has no need of conspiring with other individuals to get what he wants.  He is far too mortalized here.<br/><br/>In addition, the character interplay just doesn't have the dynamic that it does in the first movie.  Frasier and Weisz's characters just don't have the excitement and energy that they have in the first movie.  John Hannah is very funny, as he is in the first installment, and as such is a redemption to the movie.  But the part of comic relief in such a movie is supposed to be just that: a relief from the tension and excitement of the rest of the film.  Unfortunately, that just doesn't exist here.<br/><br/>And that's the fatal flaw of this movie.  It violated premises that it could ill afford to violate, in that it was boring and lacking in anticipation. There were moments that were obviously meant to suprise, catch you off guard.  Unfortunately, you could see them coming a mile away.  In addition, the characters were as uninspired as the plot, and as such all the special effects in the world couldn't save it.  The ""here we go again"" mentality of the film could have stood up, if the film itself were not so derivative of the first film, and at the same time lacking in any innovation to make it distinct.<br/><br/>I give it 5 out of 10 stars.  It can be a somewhat entertaining watch, but it doesn't hold a candle to the first film."

Gone is the humorous and somewhat quick banter between that showed actors fleshing out underdeveloped characters, to be replaced with the lamest two bit overly dramatic and unrealized crap a writer can think of.

One was the scene involving the little boy pestering his captor by asking Are We There Yet, which went on for about a whole minute before the man was driven insane. That little bit reminded me of what was good in the first one. Another thing was the mummified Pygmies.

1.  They had NO business indicating that famous wrestler ""The Roc"" was going to be in this picture.

Michael Bay had done more harm to the style of movie making than can ever be undone.  Shaking ""edgy"" extreme close-ups and relentless motion that he enjoys so much has been adopted by ""Mummy Returns"" and it's quite hard to watch without becoming dizzy.<br/><br/>So, to sum up...""Mummy Returns"" is a watered down, effected ridden pile of horse dung.

","It's 1933 and, ten years on from their last encounter with the bandaged one, Rick and Evie are happily married and living in London with their 8-year old son. Yet Evie is troubled by strange visions of ancient Egypt and the fabled Bracelet of Anubis, the control of which will bring about the resurrection of the Scorpion King. This would be (you guessed it) a bad thing to happen, as said King sold his soul to the evil god Anubis and, upon his return to life, would lead Anubis' nigh-on invincible army to take over the WORLD! Oh and, in case this wasn't enough, Imhotep has also been exhumed and revived by his followers, in the hope that he can defeat the Scorpion King and twist the inhuman army to his own fiendish desires. Muhahahahahaha. Sorry.<br/><br/>The first 'blockbuster' of this Summer, 'The Mummy Returns' is a lot of fun, as long as you abide by one simple rule: do not, under any circumstances, think about what you're watching. Cerebral content, as in the original, is sacrificed to stop anything getting in the way of the constant stream of fights, stunts and special effects and, happily, it has the same effect. Where this sequel succeeds over many others is in maintaining the level of exuberance and excitement which made the original such a success. The extra budget means that the set pieces are far bigger, the explosions far more spectacular, the extras are far more plentiful (and we all know what that means), and the locations far more grandiose. Luckily, much of the CGI has been improved as well. Some truly innovative little nasties are introduced (the skeletal pygmies being the high point), and the decaying Imhotep won't leave you sniggering behind your hand this time. The original cast are clearly having just as much fun second time around (even new additions like Freddie Boath, the Connell's eight year old son, stay on the right side of irritating), and the self-aware, tongue-in-cheek scripting of the first film also makes a welcome return.<br/><br/>If anything lets 'TMR' down, it's the sense of excess and keenness to entertain. With access to the kind of money the first 'Mummy' film only dreamt of, Sommers sometimes throws just a little too much into the visuals and it doesn't all work. Some of the CGI is decidedly ropey, and other ideas (the jet-powered dirigible in particular) simply stretch credulity that little bit too far. In truth, the plot is merely a very loose framework to hang the action on (writing the very instructions needed to kill you off again should you reawaken in your own tomb seems a little foolhardy), and The Rock really shouldn't give up his day job. <br/><br/>Yet, to be truthful, who cares? The pace and rhythm of the film is so relentless that such faults can be ignored, as they really defeat the object. I defy you to sit through the London Bus chase scene and the Mansion house fight and keep a regular, unwavering pulse. Yes it's corny and yes it's totally and unceasingly OTT, but this is Sinbad not Indiana Jones, replete with legendary monsters, handsome lantern-jawed hero and feisty heroine. If you want intelligent, thought-provoking and mysterious material then look elsewhere. Otherwise, strap yourself in and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>7.5/10<br/><br/>Matt Drew"

I didn't think that it was absolutely the worst movie of all time, but it was pretty awful. First, the pros: They assembled the original cast (actually everyone was griping about how tenuous the link was between this and the original, but I didn't think it was that bad. Certainly it wasn't the biggest problem the movie had) and the bimbo appeal was great. The cons: It takes itself way too seriously, and the gags aren't NEARLY as funny as they think they are. I interpreted the first movie as rather tongue in cheek, kind of poking fun at itself along the way, but not so with this. I kept wondering if there was some kind of oblique biblical reference going on, what with there being 12 tribes of desert warrior people, as compared to the 12 tribes of the Israelites. The badguys were the only characters that were even mildly interesting. I don't know quite what was going on with the pygmy mummies, as I had broken my glasses and I really can't see without them...but I bet it was stupid. Everything was overstylized.

With wonderful performances from Brendan Frasier, Rachel Weiz, and John Hannah this is the first summer hit of 2001. The Mummy Returns starts off ten years after The Mummy (1999).  Rick O Connell (Frasier) is now married to Evelyn and they have a son.  They then uncover the long lost bracelet of the Scorpion King played by WWF's The Rock.  They then are joined up by Imotep and some other foes, and plan to destroy the Scorpion King and gain control of his army so he can rule the Earth.  In order to save their son and stop the mummy from controlling the Earth, they must stop Imotep and the Scorpion King themselves before the world becomes a formless wasteland. WWF fans maybe disappointed however.  The Rock, in his film debut is only in two scenes throughout the entire movie.  He truly outdoes himself plating the Scorpion King, a warrior who gives his soul to become the ultimate warrior.  Although it's a small role, The Rock gives a great performance as the Scorpion King.  All that time in the wrestling ring has really paid off for him in his new role as the Scorpion King. Although some sequels have been known to be bombs at the box office, this movie is a nonstop thrill ride.  It's filled with action, comedy, romance and everything else that makes a movie an instant favorite at the box office.  Only a few sequels however have measured up to the original.  This one is worth seeing again.  The whole cast gave an outstanding performance. From 1 to 10, I would have to give The Mummy Returns a 7.8, for its outstanding performances and the well thought out plot. Brendan Frasier and the rest of the group do a fantastic job in The Mummy Returns.  The summer of 2001 is nearly here and I suggest going to go see The Mummy Returns. If you like The Mummy Returns, then here are some recommendations for movies you should see.  First, you might wish to see The Mummy, so you may see for yourself how the original compares to the sequel.  Some other movies you might want to see if you enjoyed The Mummy Returns, would probably be the Indiana Jones Trilogy (The Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade)."

"chrisbrown6453","8","0","0","2 July 2001"," A worthy sequel, but not as good as the first.
","Set 10 years after the events of the first film, when Imhotep is resurrected and determined to fulfill his quest for immortality. But there's another dark force that's about to be set loose, with the name Scorpion King.<br/><br/>This was a very entertaining film, but I'm not sure if it's better than the first. It had a lot of cool battle scenes, excellent graphics, and a lot of other cool stuff, but there was something missing. I guess I was just bored with the fact that this film is really nothing new. Still enjoyable.<br/><br/>I was surprised with the amount of money this film made this weekend. I thought it would make a good 50 or so million, but 70 million? Damn, that's a lot. I never had to buy a latter ticket showing a film and had to wait in a longass line to see a movie before, so I was surprised that that's what I had to do when I went to see this film.<br/><br/>Starts off with the Rock playing the Scorpion King, leading his men to wadge war. Eventually he makes a pact with the god Anubis and all this other crap starts happening. Fast forward into the future and Brendan Fraser's character and his wife, Rachel Weisz, are checking out another tomb. The rest is easy to figure out.<br/><br/>It was interesting to see the Rock on the big screen, since I'm so used to seeing him on my little television screen talking and wrestling with a bunch of dumbasses. His acting wasn't as bad as I expected, but he didn't really do or say much anyway. Everytime I saw him in the movie I kept thinking, he's gonna do the eyebrow I know it. It was probably my imagination, but I think I did see him do a little hint of the ""people's eyebrow"" towards the end of the film. Bah, it was probably just my imagination.<br/><br/>I liked how they tied the events of the first film into this one. It worked out quite well, and the story was pretty good. What I didn't like was the fact that the whole film was so predictable. There wasn't anything new here. A few scenes reminded me of Indiana Jones, but that was a given. I still enjoyed watching it though.<br/><br/>I really liked the huge fight scenes that took place in the movie. Especially the final fight between the two female leads.  They had quite a few of those. The effects were pretty good, except a few smaller scenes that I thought were rather funny because it was obviously computer generated.<br/><br/>There weren't any good scares in the film, but we have to remember that this isn't a horror film anyway, so they aren't going for scares. It had your basic humor and action as the first film did.<br/><br/>I would have given the movie a higher rating, but the film was just too predictable. Especially the end."
"TimeTrvlr03","7","0","0","2 July 2001"," Entertaining, but could have been better
","This movie was completely devoid of any unique plotline, but that doesn't diminish the entertainment value.  If you come into this movie expecting some profound meaning, you will be vastly disappointed by this rehashing of the same plot line that worked for Indiana Jones.  Because that is really all it is.  A little fighting, a little running, a little humor, shake it, don't stir it and you have this film.  But, if you have no expectations (I hadn't even ever seen the first one, though I hear this one was better, which makes me not want to see the first one), than you can just sit back and enjoy the scenery.  This movie was filmed in some beautiful locations (Egypt, London, Morocco, Petra, etc).  And Brendan Fraser and Oded Fehr are hunks.  And the humor kept the audience twittering, even if the delivery was a bit dry and contrived.  <br/><br/>Perhaps the worst element of this movie was some of the digital effects. The animation of the Scorpion King at the end was pathetic.  There is better animation in Pac Man.  The least they could have done was actually use The Rock rather than trying to recreate him digitally.  And enough already with the Matrix effects.  We've seen enough slow motion kicks and punches to last a lifetime.  It's time to put that technique on the shelf and give it a rest.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie won't be a classic, but its entertaining enough (score: 6.5 out of 10)."

I wonder how the actors went, they must have got sick of cavorting in front of blue screens and dodging monsters who wouldnt appear until post production. I saw this as a double feature along with the first one, which is far more substantial and involving. The acting was ok, but the live action seemed to have less screen time than all the animation.

","This film is a cynical waste of everybody's time, and we should stop passively accepting this kind of trash with comments like ""Its only entertainment, its not trying to be Citizen Kane"".  Orson Welles' career was crippled by studios who shunned his work in favour of more commercial fodder.  Until audiences start motivating film-makers to put some thought into movies before throwing us a scrappy sequel to shut us up till next summer, The Mummy Returns is all we're going to get.  Why do they assume that, because we all liked the first movie, that we want to see a sequel crammed with more of everything?  There's no room for all these characters, action scenes, (poorly-rendered) CGI and noise.  We are not stupid, and film's like this are an insight into how little the major studios really think of us.  Even if you thought it was good fun, you deserve better. This is s**t.

","The CGA is incredible throughout the movie.  Amazing...  until the very end, (you'll know what I mean when you see the movie).  I thought they could've done a better job with it (at the end, of course) and I was kind of disappointed.  I also was quite happy that they didn't deny that it was, in fact, a sequel.  In most sequels, it's either overkill with referrences to the last movie or they try to out do the first one and make little to know referrence at all.  It was cute the way things tied in. Also, you don't necessarily have to see the first Mummy to understand the second. It helps to understand the inside jokes and you might notice the reason for a few things that were in the first one (ex: why Rick wears the leather gauntlet type thing on his arm) -- but it's not really a big deal. This one is all about action, rarely does the scene ever drag.  There's enough going on to keep the audience in their seats for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>ONE thing bothered me though, and this is coming from someone who is very observant...  Brendan Fraser's character had an egyptian eye ""tatooed"" between his index finger and his thumb (I forget which hand right now) -- WHERE DID IT GO?  It couldn't have possibly faded in TEN YEARS, could it? That bothered me because I thought that was a really neat place to have a tatoo.  Maybe it was a ""mirage...""?"

","A fast action pace from beginning to end. Children are generally awful in films but Freddie Boath (Alex O'Connell) was a real exception and enjoyed some of the funnier moments in the film.  All the principles reprise their roles from the first film with the only new character being the introduction of the 'Rock' as the Scorpion King.  I'm not sure but it was probably for the best that he had limited screen time.<br/><br/>Nothing is added to the characters from the first film.  The cgi work is appalling and the scorpion king looks terrible.  Certainly inferior to what was seen in SW:TPM.  The 'blimp' thing is horrible.  I find it easy to suspend belief in the supernatural aspects of the story but this vehicle just didn't work for me.  There were no real surprises in the effects work and it was really just a carry over in most respects from the first film."

That's what you get when the story is made in function of the FX and  not the other way around, like it should be. The action pieces are all boring and are all done much better in other movies (Indiana Jones for example).  From the point where a character is introduced you can already tell what's probably going to happen, if he/she will survive etc...  What about Imhotep?  In the first movie they told us he was master over the sands and later we could witness he created a sand storm.  in this one he simply created a water storm/wall?  what's that all about?  When the heroes were so called trapped in the narrow paths with their ship, the only thing they had to do to escape was simply fly higher!

","`The Mummy Returns' brings back most, but not all the elements that made `The Mummy' such a hoot; i.e., exotic locales, larger than life characters, genuine humor and breakneck action.  However, suspense, which was not a hot commodity even in the first `Mummy' is TOTALLY absent here.<br/><br/>Fortunately, all of the surviving principals are back.  However, Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), the weasel, is sorely missed, and not altogether satisfactorily replaced.  Worse, there are TOO many villains, none of whom are given adequate screen time.  One would certainly wish for more of a contribution by Arnold Vosloo (the mummy).  Rachel Weisz looks incredibly fetching.  However, her ego must have gotten the best of her.  Can you imagine ANYONE explore insect-infested ruins wearing a Wonderbra and supermodel makeup?  Rachel probably couldn't stand how everyone (at least every male) stood up to take notice at Patricia Valazquez first appearance in `The Mummy,' wearing makeup and very little else.  Here Valazquez's most prominent assets are kept discretely tucked in her blouse (at least in the `contemporary' sequences), and she wears no makeup (a decision I am sure was dictated by Weisz).  Weisz needn't have worried.  Inept acting is a turnoff, and Valazquez is laughable in her key contemporary scene with Vosloo.<br/><br/>The movie jumps into the action portion of the plot way too quickly, which results in the brief lulls intended to build suspense building tedium instead.  The movie also promises us `The Rock,' who appears only in the flashbacks.  Instead, the `contemporary' climax gives us a phony-looking computer generated scorpion with `The Rock's' features.<br/><br/>Even with all its shortcomings, `The Mummy Returns' is one heck of a ride, a worthy, if slightly inferior successor to `The Mummy.'"

It just seemed like there was a perfect blend of Special Effects, Comedy, and Action.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns however Suffers from being a rushed project. They tried to do way to much, it to small of a time period. Mummy Returns has twice, maybe three/four times as many special effects shots as the Original film. Which is great and everything, but there just was not enough time to make them look perfect. And they were not nessary to make the film good. Don't get me wrong, I love special effects, but they just tried to do WAY TO MUCH. For example, the very end when you see the The Scorpion King... he just looks like crap. Why couldn't they just use the Rocks face?  Ill tell you why, because the movie was not finished yet! I heard that they were working on Special Effects shots for the movie up till a few weeks before it was released!<br/><br/>So I guess what I am trying to say is I wish ""The Mummy Returns"" was more like ""The Mummy.""

No real secrets or mysteries, little suspense or plot twists, huge amounts of supernatural ( read ILM ) fireworks.<br/><br/>To be precise - while M1 built up the supernatural side of the story slowly and very deliberately over the first hour, increasing the sense of mystery and the audience's expectation to good effect, M2 hits the viewer full in the face within the first 10 minutes.  Soldier mummies on speed, undead warriors of Anubis, huge ILM-animated battles and deadly trap-riddled tombs abound - after this the pace only increases only a little and tries to keep the audience glued to their seats for the remaining 2 hours from the sensory overkill from the beginning of the story. Almost all the mystery and supernatural effects are introduced in the initial onslaught, and what remains is reserved for the final 30 minutes ( except for the ultra-cool ""Mygmies"", who get far too little time and exposure, IMHO ) which again is furious, breath taking and entirely ""over the top"". The ""time shift"" scenes, as well as the airship sequence do not offer anything great or original, but are nice eye-candy. The plot is not all that unique either. Still, its likable.<br/><br/>The smart, poignant dialogues and character interactions which made ""The Mummy"" special, unfortunately are far rarer and less witty, and what remains of it requires a good working knowledge of ""The Mummy"" to really enjoy. Also, there is no real villain for the viewer to hate, dislike or fear like slimy ""Benny"" from the first part or the mummy Imhotep himself who never seems really terrifying or threatening throughout the movie and the ""Ultimate Evil"" Scorpion king remains a plot device straight out of the script (""look, the wicked archfiend !""), a major mistake in my book. Heroes need great villains to shine.<br/><br/>As for the cast, the character development of the protagonists from ""The Mummy"" is notable and plausible (in my book), if not spectacular, the acting solid ( especially John Hannah ) with the single noteworthy exception of Patricia Velasquez. As for her, great looks do not great actors make.... sorry most of the statues and background scenery deliver a better mimic performance ! 'nuff said !<br/><br/>Overall, its an enjoyable movie and I expect much weaker offings this summer, but ""The Mummy Returns"" would, on its own merits that is, not fly very far or successfully. One really need to have seen ""The Mummy"" to fully enjoy the second part.....<br/><br/>

I guess, if those were my expectations, I wasn't disappointed - at least, I shouldn't have been. But this movie had me laughing through the entire two hours, and it wasn't at the jokes. The writing is horrible; the audience was smashed over the head repeatedly with all-too-convenient plot twists, cliched dialogue and predictable situations. Maybe I'm being too harsh - no one expects a movie like this to be thought-provoking, and I'm always up for some mindless movie fun. But this was not only mindless, I could feel it sucking the intelligence from my own exasperated brain. I couldn't hold back the laughter at many of the attempted serious moments; the whole movie would have been better if the sub-plot (or lack thereof) of the family Kodak moments had been left out completely.

The original has interesting characters whereas this one has the same characters... just way less interesting. The original had a passable plot.

After watching the MTV Movie Awards last night, I enjoyed the Jimmy Fallon/Kirsten Dunst/Rob Schneider/Snoop Dogg(!) parody much more than the actual movie.

","Well first of all I must say that when I watched this movie, I was not in the movie mood. Not because somebody dragged me to the cinema to see this film, I simply couldn't pull it off to get in the right mood. I mean I would not have gotten into' this movie if I had one of them Last action Hero tickets'. But maybe all that just has me looking at the film a bit more objectively or maybe it just has me seeing some of its flaws better.<br/><br/>
First of all I must say that in this film there is an almost uncountable amount of effects, way more than in the first part and I must say that the guy I was watching it with was right when he said: This was almost as full of effects as Star Wars Episode 1. That did no harm in this film though. There were actually only a few things that really did. First of all there is The thing with the message bird' that I think is not correct, for birds can only run messages around if the guy that is supposed to get them stays at one point and one point only. Second of all the (SPOILERS AHEAD???!!!) the figures made of sand by the boy are much too good and pretty and third of all I really dislike two scenes on the air transport. First scene is the Oh I want my son back  weeping' scene and the second is the flashback  falling scene'. It is only the almost falling that bugs me, for the rest it is a great scene. A thing I also disliked is, that I immediately knew Evelyn was going to be resurrected with the book of the dead, after she died (SPOILERS END!!!). Also I thought that the guy who played Jonathan did not do too well some times and really stank, just like the cheering scene of the good guards'.<br/><br/>
That is it for the bad parts then (oh wait did I mention that Imotheps lady love was not as pretty as I thought she would be after that first glimpse in The Mummy + Rachel Weisz looked better in the original too). But that's only for shallow people and it is only my opinion and perhaps the only opinion of that kind in the world. Getting to the good stuff, the direction was good, the effects were good, the acting was good (except Jonathan (see above)). There were a couple of good jokes (some even mocking the genre (not quite as much as Scream though)) some of which were very obvious, while others were less (like the one in the beginning with all the scorpions in the mummy filled room). What I really liked though was the great music and the epic, emotional feeling the film sometimes delivered. This is a film that is at no times boring and even though I never really left the seat to become one with the characters, the story and the action I enjoyed this film<br/><br/>

","Having not seen The Mummy, but having heard favorable reviews of it, I was in optimistic mood when sitting down to watch the sequel.  It was not long before I was disappointed.<br/><br/>From the outset, The Mummy Returns makes heavy use of the now almost ubiquitous computer graphics techniques.  Though computer animation can yield extremely impressive results, this film falls into the same pitfall as Star Wars Episode 1, in that it goes for quantity not quality.  This inevitably detracts from the overall effect of the movie, as the special effects are too weak and unconvincing to add anything to the film, and so numerous as to distract the viewer from the rest of the show.<br/><br/>The plot is, as one would expect in an action sequel, thin at best and although there is nothing inherently wrong with the story, it all seems vaguely familiar from somewhere.  It is easy to spot the elements borrowed from other films, most commonly the Indiana Jones series, but unfortunately none of it hangs together well enough to really work.<br/><br/>The acting on display is notable for neither absence nor abundance of quality, although the film (and its stunt actors) should be commended for some well choreographed fight sequences.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is more or less what we've come to expect from big budget action sequels, falling into the same category as films like Jurassic Park 2; entertaining enough if you can be bothered, but really nothing to get excited about, and very, very forgettable."
"nromancer","Null","0","0","6 May 2001"," Disappointing sequel
","""The Mummy Returns"" is a disappointing follow-up to the smash-hit 1999 original.<br/><br/>Writer-director Stephen Sommers has reassembled most of the pleasing cast from ""The Mummy"", but with mixed results.  This time around, dashing adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) has married his lady love, beautiful Egyptologist Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz).  They have a nine-year-old son, Alex (Freddie Boath, who could teach ""The Phantom Menace"" 's Jake Lloyd a thing or two about acting).   Also back (from the dead) is the villainous Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo), who must defeat the reincarnated Scorpion King (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, in a role that's little more than a cameo), so that Im-Ho-Tep can take over the army of Anubis, and from there, the world.  In addition, Oded Fehr returns as the Medjai warrior Ardath Bey, and John Hannah shows up as Evelyn's playboy brother Jonathan.<br/><br/>I'll start with what I really liked about this movie.  I liked the chemistry between Rick and Evelyn; I really felt their anguish when Alex was endangered.  Fehr's Bey was very much the Jedi warrior (I know, different movie, but that's what it felt like to me).  The fight scenes were very kinetic and well-photographed.  The large-scale battles were quite rousing, especially considering the difficulties of integrating CGI and live action in a convincing fashion.  And Vosloo brought some real empathy to his role, an empathy which was mostly lacking in his earlier turn (where he was just required to be the Major League Badass).<br/><br/>But (and you knew this was coming)...so much of this movie felt recycled from the first, or at least lifted piecemeal from other genre movies.  Early on, there's one shot involving Alex that is a direct repeat of a shot from the first movie.  There are other shots that I will not reveal because they involve major plot points, but they left me very much underwhelmed.  ""The Mummy Returns"" also makes a common sequel mistake:  funny sidekicks in the first movie are given larger roles in the sequel, resulting in the sidekicks' being not quite so funny any more.  Although Hannah's Jonathan had some droll lines, for the most part, he just seemed to be emotionally retarded, which got old very quickly. ( He does, however, redeem himself.) I also thought Alex was too big for his britches for most of the movie; he was just too smart, too adult at times.<br/><br/>The final third of the movie, when the action moves back to Egypt, also felt rushed and schematic, as if Sommers simply ran out of creativity and decided to just end it.  I felt really, really cheated by the final scenes.  Again, I won't reveal the ending, but it left me completely unsatisfied. <br/><br/>
And so, to sum up this too-long review:  I wanted to like this movie.  I really did.  I feel so let down.  My grade:  C<br/><br/>-terry-"

The storyline was obviously built to support the visual effects, instead of being the visual effects supporting the storyline. Allright! My kind'a movie! At times in the movie, it was obvious that a little more money (and a lot more of time) would have done wonders to some of the effects. f.ex. the Scorpion kind had almost no facial texture, and was generally not wery well made. Also they had to fix Imhotep (i.e. make him less mummy and more human) quite early in the movie, which was obviously done to save resources. the ending was especially affected by this fenomeno. The death of Anck-Su-Namun was kind of weak, especially since she had a lot more screen-time than in the first movie. At some point the movie also got a little too ridiculous. Everybody seemed to be the reincarnation of some hero/mistress/seer/whatever.

The first Mummy was a successful thing, but who'd know that the second movie could turn out to be even better?<br/><br/>Just take a look at the special effects. I don't believe I can recall a scène where there's not a single thing that hasn't been created with a computer. It's all so perfect, and that's of course what makes a movie worth the watching. Quiet at times and extremely loud when it gets really tough, the music has it's own way of creating that icy, chilling sphere that surrounds every movement our beloved hero Rick O'Connell ( Brendan Fraser ) makes. The sudden events and the dazzling fighting sequences are splendid. And now, instead of one really bad guy, they have to defeat two dangerous Egyptian first-class bandits. With a little help of their Arabian friends this might work. <br/><br/>The actors have done a great job.

","OK we all know the story about sequels.  ""They can never match the original"".  Well I dare anyone to say that about this sequel.  Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weiss return to resurrect their roles as the 1940's explorers.<br/><br/>This time round the couple are married, and have a son.  When they open a box in an ancient Egyptian tomb they set forth a course of events that could release the Scorpion king.<br/><br/>Incidentally the Scorpion king is played by WWF wrestler ""The Rock"" and I have to say he wasn't entirely bad in his role.<br/><br/>Whoever can kill the Scorpion king can take control of his armies and either rule the world with them or send them back to the underworld where they came from.  So naturally a group of people call forth Imotep(I know I didn't spell that right).  They believe the ancient mummy is the only person that will be able to defeat the scorpion king and control his armies.<br/><br/>John Hannah also returns as the wimpy, clumsy brother to Evie, and provides some hilarious moments.  Evie's son is also hilarious with his innocent childlike confidence and total faith in his father.<br/><br/>The romantic moments between Frasier and Weiss are often comical and heart-warming, but the main attraction to this film is undoubtedly the superb effects and excellent directing.  The effects in this film are far superior to the original.  The fight scenes are more dramatic and will leave even most sceptical in awe of them.  <br/><br/>I would recommend that everyone go see this film as soon as possible, 10/10"

I do, however, admit that the fight scenes were good and exciting and all, but there were just too many! I love fight scenes, and I love movies with lots of fighting, but this was just too much. There was no plot! No reason for it! It's like, ""Hey, I don't know who that guy is, but he looks like a jerk, so why don't I beat the crap out of him?"" And since when does what's-her-name--Evie, is it?--know how to fight?! She's beating up some dude, and her son asks, ""Where'd you learn to do that, Mum?"" and she says, ""I don't know!"" Okay, how much more pathetic can you get?! <br/><br/>Aside from the ""fight anyone that looks mean"" bit, there was too much computer animation. I have my doubts that ANY of the movie was actually filmed in the location. Do you think they were really in the desert? No! Do you think they were really in an English city? Possibly, but I doubt it. I bet that the whole movie was shot in front of a green-screen. And then there's the final fight the Scorpion King! While the rest of the theater looked very into it, I couldn't help but burst into laughter. The thing didn't even look real! Sure, it looked similar to the Rock, but it definitely wasn't him! And why couldn't he have just come out as a MAN? Noooo, let's see if we can use our computers til they burst with hopes of making more money!

The mummy's face in the water is the same as the face in the sand from the first one.

","""The Mummy"" was a fun, enjoyable action film with great special effects. ""The Mummy Returns"" is pretty much the same. If you liked the first there is no way you could not like this.<br/><br/>Instead of Imhotep's face in a giant sandstorm he is there in a giant wall of water. Still cool. There are generally a little more digital FX's, which is neither good nor bad; that is the way it is. <br/><br/>There are some DIFFERENCES. The bad ones are that there is a bit less character development and more mindless fun. Some scenes and things seem aimed at a slightly younger audience, such as the flying dirigible, which I did not need. Wrestling star, The Rock, was not entirely convincing as a giant digital scorpion.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the film makes GREAT use of the two hot brunette babes, Rachel Weisz, and PATRICIA VELASQUEZ who played Ank-Su Namun, the mummy's main squeeze. Both are used much better and feistier than in the first film. Velasquez had little more than a cameo then, but fit in nicely here in a major role. Velasquez is a former Miss Venezuela and top model, and is gorgeous, and does a very nice job acting, too. If there is a third ""Mummy"" I sure want to see more of her.<br/><br/>Very good popcorn entertainment. Fun. Go see it, or rent it when available."

","I would have to say that THE MUMMY RETURNS is a more than satisfactory sequel to THE MUMMY. If you liked the first one (and I did) then you'll know what to expect and hope for this time around. And it doesn't disappoint. The return of all the main original cast members helps to give the movie that familiar ""boy's own adventure"" feel that was one of the original films winning qualities. Don't expect too much in the way of plot or story-line here but for over 2 hours of non-stop effects-led action, this picture cannot be beaten. For the most part the computer FX are very good to brilliant, but there are a couple of moments when they don't convince, especially with the appearance of the Scorpion King at the climax. It reminded me a bit of one of those excellent Ray Harryhausen creatures from JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS or any of the Sinbad adventures. Good in their day certainly but surely not cutting the high tech mustard of today's movies. Whether the budget or time was getting a bit tight or they simply went for a mega special effect too far I don't know, but whatever the reason I feel that if they couldn't match the quality to the rest of the film they shouldn't have bothered, and maybe come up with a slightly less ambitious ending. But I'm nit-picking. If you liked THE MUMMY then go and see the sequel. It's more of the same....but MORE!"

I was initially put off from the original Mummy, thinking that it was a horror flick, but after hearing more about it, I realized that it was more of a 30's action-wrapped-in-a-comedy film. The sequel follows the same basic recipe, but throws in a dash of The Rock and a few more strange creatures to add a little spice. The graphics were a visual amusement park that I had a blast riding. Plus, it was kind of nice seeing an American movie that had some Arabs as good guys in it- they weren't the only ones or even the main ones- but it was a refreshing change.

There was also a good balance of special effects, character development and story advancement. In ""The Mummy Returns"" director Stephen Sommers thought for some reason it would be a good idea to scrap everything good from the first one and fill the sequel with tons of special effects and action sequences, to distract the viewer from realizing that this movie wasn't very good. The action overload gets quite overbearing after the first 35-40 minutes and just becomes tiresome about halfway through, at which point I considered leaving but decided to give it the MST3K treatment instead.<br/><br/>The only good parts of the movie were actor Oded Fehr and actress Rachel Weisz (who looked oh so beautiful in this film).

","The plot was OK, the effects were OK, the acting was OK, the girl was...more than OK.  I enjoyed the movie despite the weak plot and incredulous situations. I even found the two leads engaging. <br/><br/>Never mind the movie itself.  What really roils me is when writers (or other decision makers) miss opportunities for better endings, and boy, they missed one this time.  In the process they also missed a chance for a much better sequel. (I've noticed that third-time-arounds tend to learn from the mistakes of their immediate predecessors.) In this case, a pivotal point comes when the mummy, rendered mortal and vulnerable, finds that his eternal love will not risk life and limb to save him.  The look on his face as she runs away was precious. He decides to let go and fall into Hell--so taking a great opportunity with him. <br/><br/>Imagine now if the O'Connells had somehow rescued him--it was well within their characterization to do so. Then we would have had a new dynamic to this ending, where the two protagonists would have had to come to some sort of terms. Imhotep now faces a life without his eternal (and faithless) lover. He has a debt, begrudgingly, to Rick. He is thrust into a different time.  Moreover he has a load of guilt he may not even recognize. I imagine them parting company with a guarded truce--not friends at all, but not now mortal enemies.  This would be a scene where some depth could have been added to all characters as they commented about right and wrong, time and eternity, loyalty and betrayal. <br/><br/>More importantly for the box office, it would have set up a scenario for one heck of a sequel. Does he regain his supernatural powers? CAN he regain them? If so, how does he use them now that his love interest is gone? I see a chance for the O'Connells to come to grips with some other evil with Imhotep the mortal on... whose side? Do we know which side; can we trust him at all?  Then perhaps a grand finale where he manages to win redemption by some act of supreme sacrifice.  <br/><br/>Ah, it could have been the best of the series.  But the opportunity's gone. (I would love to have seen them doing a dig with what is obviously the dig from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", Nazis and all, going on in the background.)<br/><br/>Now, about that balloon... I calculate its envelope would have to have been roughly 50 times the volume of the one portrayed to have lifted that boat at all, let alone fly."

","Enough rhyming, but basically that's the whole movie; The Mummy, Imhotep returns with his sweetheart, Anck-su-namun, it cost $100 million+ to make, and it's a comedy as well as an action/adventure/horror/romance/etc.<br/><br/>I read the book about a month ago, so basically I spoiled the whole plot for myself, but it was still a enjoyable.  It was slow to start with in the beginning, but as the plot built up and the action started to rise, it was exhilirating.  As far as plot goes, it is a lot more intricate and developed than the first plot, which you don't see very often in these kinds of movies.  I knew this going into the movie because of the book, and I was glad I didn't have to take too many stupid pills before the movie. Imhotep's romance with Anck-su-namun was basically the center of the plot, and Patricia Velazquez (who plays Anck, and is so friggin' hot) is in a vast majority of the film.  Don't get me wrong, Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Oded Fehr (who is also in the majority of the film) were good as the recurring characters, but my favorite character has got to be Alex, the audience favorite, played by newcomer Freddie Boath.  His smart-ass comments (coming from Evy, of course) and thick English accent make him perfect for the role.<br/><br/>My only gripes: One was the rushed look the movie had overall.  If they spent another good year and $20 million more on this movie, the special effects would be top-notch.  A lot of time was obviously spent on making the Mummy corpse look good, but this did not compensate for the cartoonish and rushed look of some of the special effects.  Even the dialogue and actors seemed a little hurried to get the movie done.  But still, you have to give the geniuses at IL+M credit for bringing the movie to life, but of course, the sequel had to get out before the first movie was forgotten.  And the other is mainly directed to teenage girls: The Rock's role is horribly overrated.  Chances are I will see the ""sequel"" that is being planned as we speak, but there better be a kick-ass story and FX, but unfortunately the 3rd movie will not be helmed by Sommers.  Too bad.  <br/><br/>Oh yeah, gotta love the baby mummies.  7/10"

It was over-loud and because I was in an excellent theater with a superb sound system (and almost no audience) there were times when Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) would do something heroic and it sounded like applause had been dubbed into the background.<br/><br/>This film borrowed heavily from many, many films  There were scenes that were right out of `Star Wars Episode I:  The Phantom Menace,' `ET: the Extraterrestrial,' `Murder on the Orient Express,' and far too many others to mention.<br/><br/>But, going back to my opening paragraph:  I enjoyed it!"

I was scary too, which it was meant to be , however, it was more funny than scary. I don't know why the genre is not Comedy in IMDB. And last but not least, it was emotional and somehow romantic too. The only lack was the Scorpion king at the end which has an ugly computerized head of ""The Rock"" instead of his own head which made it very unrealistic. If you are looking for 2 hours escape from the adventures in your life I strongly recommend this movie!"

","The first movie generated so much revenue that a sequel was bound to happen. This movie feels like it takes place just shortly after the first movie ended, Brendan is wearing virtually the same clothes as in the first movie and Wiesz or whatever seems to do the same. But apart from the clothes this movie doesn´t at all feel like the first movie even though is basically the same story, with a lovely love story mixed in. To make it blunt I dislike this movie, I was probably the only on out of about one thousand movie goers who didn´t laugh at all at the horrible jokes told through out the movie. Where the first movie succeeded in mixing jokes, alittle suspence and general fun this movie failed completely. If you want intelligent jokes then avoid this movie.

","So here's the sequel to 1999's 'The Mummy'. I think that's the standard way to start a sequel review, but if you really needed me to tell you that, then get off-line, cancel your plans for the weekend, and rent the video of the first one!<br/><br/>'The Mummy Returns' is exactly what it says on the tin. The Mummy returns. Chaos ensues. It has everything you'd expect from a thoroughly well-made sequel to a great action film - stunning effects, fantastic stunts, some nifty martial arts, just a dash of comedy to taste, and lots of improbable turns. And lots of creepy crawlies. The only thing that could possibly improve on this romp of a film is some attempt at a plot.<br/><br/>The film is straight from the same mould as its predecessor - file under 'Excellent Mong-Out Adventure Film Entertainment' - totally mindless, totally enjoyable, from beginning to end. Hurray for dumbing down! Brendan Fraser perfects the unsubtle-but-lovable-American act and Rachel Weisz is ideal as his squealy-girly English wife, while being feisty enough to keep the character clear of slap-able uselessness. Their kid (Freddie Boath) is suprisingly tolerable (given my cynically low acceptance threshold for precocious kids in films) - amusingly gobby, and yet rarely crossing the boundary into irredeemable obnoxiousness. John Hannah is a bit pitiful playing the wet Englishman part. It should have been good, it's almost fantastic - it's a great role, well written, very capably acted, if a bit overplayed - but it all seems such an insult to his lovely Scottish accent. Patricia Velazquez as Anck-Su-Namun is frankly astounding. I could go on to commend the excellent roles of Lock-Nah (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Izzy (Shaun Parkes) and The Scorpion King (The Rock), in similar glowing terms, but this could get boring.<br/><br/>And, well, I've saved the best till last. The nominees for sexiest man on the planet are........ both in the same film? Impressive! We get to see much more (wahey!) of the rather tasty Oded Fehr, as the dark and enigmatic Ardeth Bey, but he's pipped to the post by the delicious Arnold Vosloo, as Imhotep, who we get to see plenty of too. Really, lots and lots of him. And he doesn't have beetles in his head this time. Mmm-mmm. That evil undead charisma wins me over every time."

","I, like a lot of others, had read the reviews and decided to take them with a pinch of salt since most of the same critics had drubbed the first one as well. My instincts proved correct; this movie is an awful lot of fun, the way the relationship evolved between Rick and Evie was great, and their son was an absolute hoot; not irritating like most child stars. The effects are already leaps and bounds ahead of Sommers' first Mummy, and I found the action to be breathtaking rather than overwhelming. To the critic who said it was like watching a videogame over someone's shoulder-- Did we see the same movie? Other great things about this one-- the Rock was perfect as the Scorpion King, despite his limited screen time, and I absolutely loved Patricia Velasquez as the reincarnation of Anck-su-Namun. This is definitely one case in which to ignore the critics completely and enjoy. I know I did."

","Although some of the shock is not there this time round because you know what is coming in parts, this may well be a cinematic rarity, a sequel that is a good as the original.<br/><br/>The film opens with Rick and Evie, now the happily married couple snooping around a tomb with their son in tow. Evie has been having some strange dreams about this dig, which is confirmed when she is able to open the tomb using keys which she knows nothing about. They fight of the baddies, a la Indiana Jones and go back to England with a bracelet belonging to the Scorpian King. The heavies want this as Anck-su-namum is planning on raising Imhotep again and using the Scorpian King's bracelet to rule the world. Queue the non stop action. Alex is kidnapped as he puts on the bracelet and can only remove it at the Temple belonging to the Scorpian King.<br/><br/>
Ardeth Bey aids them in their quest. The CGI is, as you would expect superb. This time round the girls get to beef up their fight scenes. Rachel Weisz certainly can do this.

"LJ27","Null","0","0","25 May 2001"," Makes the first one look good...
","I didn't expect much from this film but I have to say that it performs the service of making the first film look like CITIZEN KANE by comparison. Sure, the dog-critters in the beginning are cool but we have no idea where they came from or why they are here.  The Rock, for all of the publicity surrounding his appearance is on the screen for maybe 5 minutes maximum. The mummy himself seems to be something of a supporting player behind Branden, his wife and kid and brother-in-law and even the pilot.  The movie can't seem to decide what it wants to be about so it is about the ""Scorpion King"", the Mummy and some midget pigmy creatures that appear to be refugees from a bad video game.  I've read where people have gushed over Alan Silvestri's score and claim it's better than Jerry Goldsmith's score for the original film.  Goldsmith's score for the first film was magnificent and even better when compared to Silvestri's.  Not to say Silvestri cannot write a great score - he can and has done so with his scores for PREDATOR and CONTACT but the score for MUMMY RETURNS is far from being his best work. Funny thing that even though the scenes taking place in London were filmed in London, they don't look like it.  They look like they were filmed on a set in Burbank and could have been making you wonder why they went to the trouble to film in London.  The thin storyline could barely support the first movie.  It sure can't support two movies and although they are filming SCORPION KING as I write this, that is an idea that's already D.O.A. Universal Pictures needs to realize this series of films has already run it's course and do the all CGI FRANKENSTEIN film they shelved last year instead."
"wskopal","Null","0","0","25 May 2001"," superficial fun for the undemanding
","once again here is a movie that is insanely successful without really deserving it (in my humble opinion, that is). sure, it has lots of effects (some great, some not so hot), plenty of action and some likable characters, but overall it´s all facade and no substance. director stephen sommers obviously tried to surpass the first movie´s ""wow-factor"", but unfortunately chose to sacrifice every little bit of story, atmosphere and character development the original had in the process. what little story there is can be summed up in two sentences and is nothing but a lame excuse for heaping CGI effect upon CGI effect and elaborate setpiece upon elaborate setpiece, effectively reducing the movie to a showcase for Industrial Light & Magic. all of the characters are stereotypical cardboard cut-outs, which in a way is just as well, as viewers are thrown into the thick of the action from the get-go, leaving anybody who hasn´t seen the original to his own devices in figuring out who´s who and how the characters are related to each other.<br/><br/>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS COMING UP*<br/><br/>what´s worse is that both vosloo as the mummy and Dwayne ""Rock"" Johnson as the much-hyped scorpion king are never given anything to do. the former has about 6 scenes and hardly any dialogue in the whole movie while the latter pops up for two minutes without a line of dialogue at the very beginning, only to return as a badly made and decidedly anticlimactic CGI effect at the very end. judging from ""the mummy returns"" it´s hard to believe that a scorpion king spin-off movie is seriously being developed on the supposed strength of the character. the mind boggles... the actors´ performances, by the way, oscillate between adequate (Fraser, Weisz, Fehr) and dreadful (notably Velasquez). Fraser in particular looks like he had a blast shooting the movie and is eminently likable throughout, which somehow only made me wish he´d turn to making better movies again, while Vosloo - unsurprisingly - looks downright bored at times. as if all of this wasn´t enough, whole characters and action scenes are blatantly ripped off either from the first movie (compare the canyon chase to the sandstorm chase in the original) or other films (e.g. the pilot character, who is a straight lift from Mad Max 2).<br/><br/>so what´s the overall verdict? well, i really wanted to like this movie, and i did, in a way, although for all the wrong reasons. it´s entertaining on a very superficial, purely audio-visual level but left me completely uninvolved throughout. since the characters are so one-dimensional and underused, I never really cared for what would happen to them, and the endless barrage of effects sommers throws at the viewer gets more and more tiring as the movie goes on, making the whole affair seem strangely hollow. ""the mummy returns"" is all appearance and no soul. only for the undemanding..."

","Hello everyone, (Please read what I wrote about ODED FEHR at the end)<br/><br/>Indeed I was waiting a lot for this film. But don't think that I am a fan or something. I always try to decide wisely. And this film didn't disappoint me. I like Brendan Fraser. He is capable of a lot. He acts great. If he keeps up this way, he will probably be a superstar. Indeed this films seems to be made him a superstar already...<br/><br/>Anyways back to the film. I have heard about Stephen Sommers but nothing specific was in my mind about him. I mean there are lots of directors around and you know something in particular about each one. I can say that this is a great second part for The Mummy. He wrote a great script and a story. I thought that I would be disappointed by this film but on the contrary I like it a lot.<br/><br/>I have to say that I didn't like the visual effects a lot. There are lots and lots of visual effects in the film but especially as we approach the end of the film the quality of the effects decreases. I think the effects guys were tired of making effects and as they come closer to the conclusion they didn't pay attention a lot.<br/><br/>What I liked the most is something we don't see in the movies a lot. Everything collapses at the end and the good guys can't even have a proof or money or anything after all they do. In the first movie they able to take some treasure. And in this one too. I liked that. Why are the directors or the scenarists are afraid that the heroes will get rich? Are they afraid that they would feel sluggish and get out of form so that it would be harder to film the next movie with fat heroes? The small creatures were also very funny and creepy and scary. I appreciate the guy who created the model.<br/><br/>And above all ODED FEHR. I liked him and the character a lot. He didn't make so much films but the character in this film and himself are in harmony. The best character of the movie is Ardeth I think. The Madji (I don't how to spell it) are very cool. Especially he is very cool. They fight great and never give up. You can always count on them. Hey ODED if you read this, mail me. I want to meet you in person for a signed autograph.<br/><br/>All the crew of the film. Keep up the good work..."

","Well the Mummy Returns is exactly that. Entertaining no doubt but ever so similar to the first film. The returning cast return playing exactly the same characters with some extra 'revelations' casually thrown in. As a pure entertainment it isn't bad at all. However much was brought over from the first film you wonder where all the good ideas have gone (the special effects?). The Scorpion King was good but was ultimately superficial but the O'Connell offspring was a tad irritating. Everything else is frighteningly samey, even certain plot devices were recycled. Once again we are treated to Imhotep's face chasing our heroes and we get another oddball pilot.<br/><br/>Of note is the substantial amount of visual effects the viewer is assaulted with. Some were great (the oasis) but some were rather disappointing (the Scorpion King) but as a whole they worked well and gave a film a nice sheen.<br/><br/>All in all rather fun but nothing new. People who watched the first film will know what to expect. Just leave your brain at home, sit back and enjoy. I give this a 7."

","Short version of review: See above. A must-see! It is *virtually* as good as ANY action-packed movie can EVER get. Excellent.<br/><br/>Long version of review: Well, I haven't seen the first film... yet. I am going to rent it now, after watching the sequel :) If it's one forth as good, I would definitely enjoy it *a lot*. Back to The Mummy Returns. What do you know? It does return!! :) Although I didn't know it was gone :))) Let me list the major points of enjoyment for me in this movie. 1. Astonishing DYNAMICS. Non-stop action, suspense, thrill, awe, use your favorite word. A roller-coaster of fun, as they say :) Enough to make me want going for it again. Yes, that good. *Very few* compare. 2. Scenes, sets, props, views, ... you name it. Eye-candy, as they say :) Also VERY good. Breathtaking views, indeed. Tower Bridge (erroneously referred to as the ""London Bridge"" :) at night is fantastic. The endless desert, the ancient Egyptian sites, the Pyramids. Loved'em all :) 3. Cast! Now, don't get me wrong -- no stellar performances here. But neither such are needed here, believe it or not. It all blends together perfectly the way it is. And this is that way: all actors are very well-chosen and suitable for their roles. Including The Rock. He is great, by the way. In the beginning, that is. Some say the Scorpion King in the end is cartoonish and awful? Never mind, he's OK. Perhaps, could have been a little better. OK, I admit it: could have been way better. So what? The film goes along with it and is watchable and very much enjoyable. Nobody's perfect, ya know :) And one more note on the cast -- diversity! A LOAD of different characters, a majority of them are leading roles :))) It's FUN. 4. Battle scenes deserve to be a separate entry. Really. I was blown away!! The movie could have been titled The Grand Battles In The Desert. Again, enough to make the film a must-see on their own. 5. Sound and music. On a par with the best!! Very convincing, enjoyable, touching. Loud. And in this movie, it also is a merit. This movie startles, and terrific sound takes much credit for that.<br/><br/>Now... STOP READING THE REVIEWS. GO OUT AND BUY A TICKET TO ONE OF THE BEST ACTION/ADVENTURE FILMS EVER."

","The Mummy Returns is so preposterous and ludicrous that I actually enjoyed it. No logic, no tension, the complete antithesis of what is called ""art"", but lots of silliness, corny one-liners, and fake (albeit quite eye-pleasing) background. It seems to rip off every movie I can think of, heck, it even rips off The Phantom Menace, that timeless classic. I mean how low can one gets? But it sure was good, clean mindless entertainment, on par with Gladiator. So hey, if the Academy continues to be as dumb... All the ""horror"" elements in the movie made me laugh; OK, almost everything made me laugh, even the fatal stabbing scene. The combat scenes are of two kinds, one-on-one and mass battle. The latter are interesting only in their preparation stages when the two armies set up; the former are not much better save the fight between the two Egyptian princesses during the flashback: it is good only because it is a direct rip-off of Crouching Tiger (the fight in the training room), even the moves are the same (they even switched weapons half-way through!), not as awe-inspiring, or as well done or shot of course. In conclusion, if you enjoyed watching the first one, don't miss this one: you'll laugh twice as much and for longer periods too, and that alone is worth the price of admission."

","Not only is this one of the worst movies ever made, but in my opinion it was extremely funny.  It wasn't meant to be funny though.  At the meant to be funny parts I shuddered due to the cliched movie hogwash I was hearing. Some parts were just unbearable.  There were so many stupid mistakes that the directors made that were in the film.  I don't mean like seeing a shadow or a boom mike on accident, I mean things that just don't make any damn sense.  For Example:  When the team of adventurous, pulp comic, Indiana Jones rip-off team of heroes were traveling in a blimp made out of wood, they had a fire in the blimp.  I don't mean in a secluded little stone alcove made for bonfires, I mean right on the wooden floor of the blimp. This is what I saw!  And then, later, when the heroes were trying to escape impending doom from a previously KILLED AND SENT TO HELL mummy monster guy, they escaped on their blimp in a very fake manner.  They didn't deflate the balloon or anything that stupid, they used advanced rocket technology...with seemingly no harsh burns or accidents...in 1935...when rocket technology was unheard of...on an independent charterer's seemingly pieced together by junk blimp.  Just great. That made a whole lot of sense.  The scenes in this movie just didn't make sense.  When Brendan Frasier and that magi guy are stalking through a museum, they encounter many live mummies...trapped in glass...brought back from the dead.  That all seems okay.  But when this seemingly terrifying ordeal was over, they seem unfase, the don't even mention the incident...ever.  And what is the deal with Imhotep or whatever. He was dragged to Hell at the end of Mummy part one, right?  Well, now somehow they dug him up only to find him encased in some sort of bug carcass loookin thing.  HOW?  HOW?  HOW?  THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!!!  I couldn't control myself at many parts of the movie from making both snyde remarks and immense outbursts of rude laughter.  Oops!  The cliched gun fights with the average enough lookin Arabs were once again, completely stupid.  The same thing happened again and again.  A bunch of Egyptians clad in the average turbin and desert fatigue (IN LONDON!!!) with NO ACCURACY FIRING THE AUTOMATIC WEAPON were killed almost instantly any time the good guy pointed a gun at them.

","First of all I want to mention that I´m a fifteen year old Austrian so my English is not the best one or very poor.<br/><br/>What´s to say about the Mummy returns? Nice sequel. Of course not as good as the original film but not too bad at all. The plot was quite disappointing. One action scene followed another. The mystical,calm parts of the first film which I very estimated are almost removed except a few romantic scenes. I also missed the good old British humor of John Hannah. In my opinion is the Mummy returns more Fantasy than it is Horror. On the other hand the battle between the Madjai and the Army of Anubis and the duel between Rachel Weisz and Patricia Velasquez make the film worth seeing. Besides, I think that Miss.Weisz was more adventurer than the mother of an eight year old boy, which does not mean that she is a bad actress. - By the way I´d say that Rachel Weisz is one the most beautiful, lovely and attractive woman in Hollywood  ;) - What a pity that beauty and charm don´t make a good film. Oded Fehr was in contrast to some special effects (the appearance of the Rock or when the whole jungle disappeared into the Golden Pyramid) brilliant in his role as the commander of the Madjai armed whether with his sword or with the Thompson.  *Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta!* As well as Ardeth Bay was Arnoldo Vosloo as Imhotep who showed more emotions than in the original film.

","Oh boy, what a turkey.  This is a terrible film, Stephen Summers should be ashamed of himself, for putting together such a bad film.  The idea for the film is interesting but unfortunately, due to some terrible writing and uninspired direction, the film just goes from one fight scene to the next, with little development of the plot or characters in between. The some of the set look extremely good, while others look tacky and cheap. The CGI varies from jaw droppingly good to awfully computery, proving that because something can be done, it does not mean that it should be.  The acting is wooden, with none of the character being particulary interesting. The could have something to do with the terrible dialogue which could have come from a bad fifties B movie.  Again, we see another annoying kid, who is given far to much screen time.  When will Hollywood learn that kids and films don't mix.

The opening sequence with the Rock as the Scorpion King was excellant, but had I known that a prefessional wrestler would be putting forth the most believable perfomance of the movie I would have left after that.<br/><br/>I respected the original ""The Mummy"" as a rather funny and well done take on the whole Indiana Jones genre of movies - but this seemed to be way too over the top, with little regard for anything but action. We get no explaination for the son that is suddenly in the picture, or the mansion that they seemed to have stocked with every archeology piece known to man. All we get is some handwaving - ""look at our cool mummies!""  We even get a huge computer animated scorpion king, which really looks plastic and inferior to the animation from Spawn, which predates this movie by at least four years.<br/><br/>The closing action, and the view into the human side of Imhotep, as well as the very nice background for his origin are what save this movie.<br/><br/>Probably best watched after you re-watch the Mummy."

","I just saw ""The Mummy Returns"" a few hours ago, and was pleasantly surprised with it. I actually consider it to be a little bit better than its predecessor. The graphics and creature effects were really good, with the exception of those used during the fight scene between Rick O'Connell and the Scorpion King. I particularly liked the funny pygmy monsters and the scary Anubis warriors. Freddie Boath was really good as the O'Connells' son Alex, and made me laugh in several scenes. Another character that I liked was Ardeth Bay, the mysterious nomad leader first seen in the original film (They should make a spinoff movie about him instead of one about the Scorpion King). I kind of liked the humorous hidden references that were made to the first film(Such as the scene in the first one when Jonathan has difficulty deciphering a certain hyroglyphic during a crucial moment). It was also pretty cool to finally see Evelyn really fighting in a few scenes.This movie was more exciting than the first one, and for the most part, more fun in general."

","I went to see this with my older brother (he's 22, i'm 19)because we both liked the original for it's sense of old-fashioned action adventure (for a new generation). So we figured this would be about the same, but more of it. We couldn't be more right. Even though i do like the film's light- heartedness, the special effects are what (for me anyway) really ruined the film. Almost every single shot contains that damn CGI (i'll take stop-motion animation anyday). Not that i hate CGI, but it has to be functional, here it all seems too forced to be natural, heck, even the backgrounds of ancient Egypt looked fake, whereas in the Mummy they looked great. The action in the film was inventive and pacey, but again ruined by all that CGI rammed down your throat (you don't know where to look). Overall i'd say this is an enjoyable film, great for a Friday or Saturday night with your mates and spectacular fun for the kids, but for me the sometimes great, sometimes terrible CGI was way too much and the ending was disappointing too: they promised so much with it, but in the end all we have is a badly animated scorpion king.<br/><br/>*** out of *****"

"Mojo-Jojo","6","0","0","5 May 2001"," Fun but disappointing
","It is always said to see when a director and writer sacrifices what might have been a quality story for special effects. This is the case with the sequel to Stephen Sommer's ""The Mummy"". I sort of knew this would be the case when looking at the previews they showed several scenes with the army of Anubis marching across the desert but none of the story. This is because while the story was there and it was interesting, it was nothing to write home about. There was one review I read that compared Rick O'Connel (Fraser) to Indiana Jones. Fedora hat included this comparison may be accurate but this movie is better compared with the second of the Indy sequels which by all accounts was not as good as the first or third Indy movies.<br/><br/>
This movie introduces itself very well. The first half hour is very entertaining as we are shown all the main characters and told basically what to expect. The problems happen about the point where the characters find themselves on the way back home to London. There are all these guys running around in red suits and we have no idea what their motivation is other than wanting to wake up Mr. walking talking corpse. Why would you want to do that? They never explain it. From that point on the movie is fun (don't get me wrong - it was fun to watch) but it lacked the original's originality. The humor, I am happy to say, is still present and made for good times.<br/><br/>The other day I watched the original movie with the director's commentary turned on and got a glimpse of why this movie is the way it is from Mr. Sommer's comments. There is no doubt that he is talented but he should have stuck with creating a good story and then hired ILM to do the SFX. I won't comment on ""The Rock"" as he in only in the movie for about 15 minutes and his role is... different.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

","The Mummy Returns visits all the horrors of action fantasy sequels upon us. Within two minutes, they commit the first great sequel crime of introducing an unnecessary pre-teen lead ""to appeal to the kids"".  As soon as he speaks, you realise it's a performance so bad the film can't gloss over it.  When he's off screen, which isn't often, the film has its moments, but you know it isn't the film you were waiting for.  Didn't anyone realise part of the pleasure of the original was that it was exactly scary enough for kids? This is as scary as a visit to your gran.  The plot is nonsense dragged forward by blather about visions and past lives.  All the worst nightmares of fantasy film sequels are repeated.  The boy is everything that was wrong with Anakin Skywalker.  There's a pilot character like the lacklustre pilot from Mad Max 3 who was recycled from the quirky pilot in MM2.  There are mummified Ewoks, which may have started out as ironic but when it comes down to it an Ewok is an Ewok, and that's not a good thing.  There are some good set pieces, and some impressive effects, but it's very long, and there are some really bad bits, and too many of the effects are not very good.  The first ""Mummy"" was a well-played action script and I laughed my ass off.  The sequel is a little more than watchable.  A big disappointment, its saving grace is a timely reminder just how good the original Indiana Jones films were."

","I honestly fail to see what all the hype for this movie is ABOUT.  Its rave reviews and constant chattering of my peers had me convinced that this would be a decent movie.  I was sadly disappointed.<br/><br/>First of all, I WILL admit that the special effects are tremendous...some of the best I've ever seen.  However, the immense effects suffocate what little plot there is.  Action scenes  unimportant to the plot that drag on FOREVER, characters switching accents, and (most disturbingly) several cultural errors. For example: Reincarnation is a major underlying theme in this movie.  Anyone with only a minor knowledge of the culture KNOWS that the concept of reincarnation DID NOT EXIST AT ALL in Ancient Egyptian society. I'm sure there were many other errors of this sort, but I wouldn't know. I'm not majoring in Egyptology.<br/><br/>With its tremendous effects that overshadow its feeble plot, shaky characters, and cultural faux pas, I would not recommend The Mummy Returns to anyone over the age of 12."

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS First I have to point out a major inconsistency between this and the first film. Does anyone here remember Imhotep being completely removed fro  the picture in the first movie? Yes? Then how come he somehow manages to be encased in this big lump of rock?<br/><br/>Anyway, credit due to Sommers for his knack of putting together silly plots as an excuse to induce some really exciting action sequences. I think this film also rank up there with The Phantom Menace (and the next 2 Star Wars movies) as one of the most SFX reliant movies made so far (not including completely computer animated stuff). The same goes for the music, which I thought was excellent and really in your face - credit to Alan Silvestri, who replaces Jerry Goldsmith from the last movie.<br/><br/>This movie is more comedy-orientated, and as a result lacks any of the feasibility of the first, which was better in my view. The plot is gets needlessly complicated along the way, loads of things cropping up like ""He has the Sceptre of thingymabob"" and ""It's the magic box of watchamacallit"". They crop up so much that there isn't much point in seeing this one if you haven't seen the first, for you would have no idea what they're talking about otherwise.<br/><br/>It also felt a tad too long, and the ending battle felt a bit dragged out, predictable, but the Scorpion King was interesting. And the movie was loud - VERY loud, the combination of the music and the shouting and the swords and whatnot making this volume possible.<br/><br/>Exhilirating spectacle it is - comparable to it's predecessor it's not."

","Often I visit these pages for different movies and find it disheartening to see so many critics not being fair, they either say ""Pathetic, Terrible"" or ""Best Film Ever, A Must See""<br/><br/>Well, I hope to give you a balanced understanding of the film as I saw it. The film overall is very good, the sequel follows pretty close to the original scene set out in the first movie and so fairs well with those who have seen the first whilst still maintaning enough material so that viewers who have not seen the first can enjoy the film.<br/><br/>The Acting is not perfect but is still put accross well. I agree with some of the comments posted here, that the child does not fit with the characters and plotlines, there should have been some development with the main characters' relationship with each other before a family was introduced, especially if they are releasing a third!<br/><br/>Sadly though the film falls into the tired stereotypical view of a sequel, where the writer has not spent enough time in developing the plot so that each event affects the relationship between all characters. As a result the characters appear flat and do not relate very well with the audience. However this is still no where near as bad as some of the sequels I have seen before, like the terrible regurgitation that Disney's ""Dinosaur""  is to Don Bleuth's  ""The Land Before Time""<br/><br/>If there is one word to describe the plot in this movie, the word would be ""Linear""<br/><br/>I will add a bit more though and talk about the SFX for a moment, generally the sfx were good but in the last scene when the Scorpion King appears I laughed at how terrible that effect was, it seemed to me that they wanted to finnish this scene as quickly and as cheaply as possible(Perhaps their budget ran out?) It was terribly unconvincing,  but that is not to say that it is easy to do - it takes a lot of skill and I always respect that no matter how unconvincing the effect.<br/><br/>My vote for this film is 6/10 as it was enjoyable and entertaining but lacked the proper depth that is needed to make a good film."

","Now, how can this movie be described....think of the original, add three new characters and that's about it.<br/><br/>The plot ranges from non-existent at best to ludicrous, over the top and down-right stupid at worst. Scenes from the original are repeated ad nauseum and anyone with more than four brain cells will be able to easily work out what happens from the trailer.<br/><br/>Ideas from the first movie are either ""borrowed"" or ignored completely such as the long and painstaking ritual of resurrection of the Dead is accomplished in less time by an 8 year old boy than Imotep, Master of Egyptian Magic.<br/><br/>The CGI is in many cases exactly what we would expect from a big budget movie. Unfortunately the makers obvious ran out of supercomputer time towards the end of the excruciatingly long movie and had to render the final scenes on a Commodore 64. This is particularly noticeable on Dwayne's big finale who obvious took time out from the computer game of the film.<br/><br/>Saying all of this, the action scenes are very well executed if never original or surprising. The fight direction does contain several elements which, personally I would like to see repeated in the Matrix 2 and other of the genre.<br/><br/>In all, not the worst movie this year, but getting there. If you want to see a thinking movie with a fresh and original plot, don't watch this. However, if you just want to switch off and watch a decent action movie with some humour and good special effects.....rent the original, it's much much better."

Ah, The Mummy Returns...<br/><br/>Sure, you're whisked away to foreign lands with wonderful scenery. Sure, there's action and adventure. But can it pass off as entertainment? In my opinion, anyone with an intelligence level that surpasses the 6th grade should be disappointed. And if you aren't: shame on you. This film seems to have been made by drooling mongoloids and only is intended to be enjoyed by the same.<br/><br/>Honestly, if this movie would have followed the premise and the story of The Scorpion King, I believe this could have been a decent film. The only things that the element of The Scorpion King does is: Get another big name into the film to make it look good while marketing it and to clutter up the story (if there really ever was one!).<br/><br/>Look here folks, we all know the purpose of this film was made to make money. That's the bottom line. Am I wrong in expecting maybe something DECENT in return for paying for admission. You can take ANY part of the dialogue in the entire movie (and even the plot itself) and imagine this movie being written by a couple of 8 year old kids playing in the sandbox with some X-men and G.I. Joe figures. Its just THAT mindless.<br/><br/>If you want a film in a similar vein that is of better quality, check out The 13th Warrior. But, if you're determined to see this movie, the only redeeming points you should find are The Rock's reported Eight Million dollar performance (for 5 minutes in the movie) and the stunning Rachel Weisz. I honestly believe she was the only thing that kept me watching. For those two factors, I am giving it a generous 3 out of 10. BEWARE, YOU WERE WARNED!!!"

","As all sequels go, this wasn't as good as the first one. But it was still rather good. And had the potential to be *much* better! I *loved* the continuity from first to second. The continuing fragments of the story are wonderfully inserted here to add a strong feeling of connection between the first and second films. And the characterization continued to be wonderful (and thankfully, they didn't let the Rock act much;)<br/><br/>But that said, there were many aspects that just plain ruined an otherwise clever story. The romance was just plain horrid. Not that it existed, rather the way it was handled. It just got sappy and cheezy with silly dialogue and ridiculous overtones. Not to mention we were hammered over the head with it. And I don't generally like brats in films like these (Temple of Doom perhaps being one of the few exceptions), and though this one was better than most (no incessant whining and screeching) he was still a bit out of place and was focussed on WAY too much. As well, John Hannah's antics were completely overdone this film...and Rachel Weisz wasn't clumsy enough.<br/><br/>That side, the baddies were all amusingly well acted (great seeing Adewale in a role other than hardened criminal...oh...never mind;) I still think he's an amazing actor!) and I love the guy who plays Imhotep. But the pacing of the film (which started *really* well) got skewed about halfway through the film and the film started to suffer. Too many action scenes jammed into too short a period of time. They were all becoming generic (and rehashes of the first film), and how many cliffhanger 'He's going to die!! Quickly!! Grab him!!' scenes can one bear within a couple of hours??? The final John Hannah grab for the jewel had me rolling my eyes and begging for the bloody film to finish already! (and cartoon style action films are cartoon style action films, but it would be nice to see a good character in some actual pain and peril once in awhile or it simple becomes yawnable).<br/><br/>Overall: I liked the film. I especially loved the continuity between films. And I look forward to The Scorpion King. But I hope that it's better scripted and lives up to its potential a bit more. 6/10."

It wasn't as comical as the first, which is good because every time a sequel tries to be more funny than the first, it's usually worse.  The comic relief (Johnathan Hannah) and the ""kid factor"" (Freddie Boath) were kept just enough in the distance to keep from being annoying.  The special effects weren't flawless, but alot of time went into them.  Glad to see the main characters from the original were back.  Also glad to see that they didn't over-do the bugs.  There were still plenty of creepy crawly things, but I thought the whole movie would be non-stop bugs after seeing how they used them in the first movie....thank God.  I wish The Rock would have had a bigger role at the end, but I thought it was cool to see him come back in ""final boss"" form, even if it was a computerized Rock.<br/><br/>All in all, I left very happy.

The story line was great,not a all confusing,everything tied up for me. The scenes lovely...(London Bridge at night,the London Home,The Pyramids,The Egyptian costumes.etc.....) The love affair between The Mummy and his long lost love,though I not sure I agreed with the outcome of that,but maybe it's not the end of the story.........? It was totally absorbing from  start to finnish,never letting you catch a breathe with non-stop action.The only other film that as kept my constant attention like that was Terminator two.Well done to everyone involved.

","I think I liked ""The Mummy Returns"" even better than the first ""Mummy."" Brendan Fraser seems to be a pro when it comes to combining action hero moves and comedy delivery.  Arnold Vosloo does his role well as Imhotep, but it seems the focus on him yields to that of the Rock as the Scorpion King. I was impressed by the visual effects, particularly the scene where the oasis springs up around the Scorpion King.  But I must admit that the CGI wasn't perfect all the time.  When the Scorpion King comes out as the monster near the end, the Rock's face looks like it came out of a wrestling video game.

","Brendan Fraser is the only thing wrong with this movie.  He still hasn't learned to act, but someone at least learned how to handle him.  Give him short and simple lines and let the action support him.  Fraser would do well to emulate another top box office non-actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger and learn to make light of himself.  Think True Lies.  Has Arnold ever been better?<br/><br/>Everything else is fantastic.  This film is infinitely better than The Mummy.  There is more story, more drama, more action, more special effects, more of everything.  <br/><br/>This time out, evil Archaeologists stage a battle between Imhotep (Vosloo) and the Scorpion King (The Rock) to gain control over the armies of Annubis. Along the way, we get deeper into the story of Anck-su-Namun and Imhotep. A new story line develops that ties Fraser and his new wife, Evie (Rachel Weisz), closer to the ill-fated couple than they could have imagined.  John Hannah, who returns as Evie's hapless brother, and Freddie Boath as her and Fraser's son, add comic relief galore.  Arnold Vosloo is once again fabulous, and I'd love to see him get more good roles.  Patricia Velazquez returns as the other half of the star-crossed lovers, Anck-su-Namun.<br/><br/>The movie succeeds at tying the two stories together, and using the first film to raise the stakes.  The much touted Scorpion King role is a bit of a letdown, but the spinoff is already being filmed, without, unfortunately the majority of this cast.  I always thought that The Mummy might have been as good as the Indiana Jones films if Fraser could act.  This movie deals with that problem, and earns its place as a peer with the Indiana Jones trilogy in movie history.  It does everything well.  Even the credits are the best I've ever seen, and the ending song is tasty.<br/><br/>A summer sequel spectacle that exceeds the original!"

","Sequels,you can't do anything about it. You know it will come back when a movie gross over 100 hundred million dollars(more close to 200m). The question remains would it be a good sequel or a bad one? The answer depends of what you expect from a film or,for that matter, a sequel. If you expect that the sequel will give you some characters development,will be more sophisticated and will have some reasonable not to mention a convincing plot, than look somewhere else , because you will not find these things in this film. It basically do ""The Mummy"" all over with not much changes to it. The characters remain the same, though the addition of Evie's past was a nice touch,though very much convenient. The plot the remains the same, and everything goes as predictable as a sequel can be. Not a shred of surprise or originality here. You can see what comes miles ahead.The effects were good though in some cases they looked like computer generated ones (which means they look phony and not convincing enough, which shouldn't happen in a film that relies heavily on effects).<br/><br/>Nevertheless the film is fun to watch and entertaining enough to ignore all other aspects. The film enjoy a fast phase which is its great asset and help passed it 2 hours running quite quickly. <br/><br/>It is not a must film. It will take 2 hours from your day leaving you with the feeling the you have received value for your money. What kind of value is another question."
"lordguano","6","0","0","21 May 2001"," Mindlessly entertaining...
","Here we have one of those rare sequels that is every bit as good<br/><br/>as the original. Of course, I'm not saying the original was any good<br/><br/>to begin with. Actually, I'm not even sure they didn't just basically<br/><br/>recut the same old movie and tag one or two new characters and<br/><br/>then release it under this new title! <br/><br/>In any event, I took my 7 year old boy to see the movie and he had<br/><br/>a ball. Come to think of it, I was pretty well entertained also. Plot<br/><br/>details are too silly (and inconsequential) to get into. Suffice to say,<br/><br/>the title character (the sullen Imhotep) is somehow resurrected<br/><br/>and, by some contrivance, once again must face the meddling of<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz (now married with a tow headed<br/><br/>Junior Egyptologist as their son) and the bumbling brother-in-law<br/><br/>John Hannah. Mysterious native good-guy Ardeth Bey is also back<br/><br/>as are the usual Indiana Jones inspired assortment of swarthy<br/><br/>power (or money) hungry villains. <br/><br/>The new twist involves the legendary character of the Scorpion<br/><br/>King (WWF's The Rock in his well suited -- and undemanding --<br/><br/>debut performance) whose legend is laid out in a tidy opening<br/><br/>sequence set some 5000 years in the past. Suffice to say, the<br/><br/>forces of both good and evil are concerned with the Scorpion<br/><br/>King's resurrection and the ancient prophesy that would release<br/><br/>the evil Egyptian God Anubis' army of the undead upon the<br/><br/>unsuspecting world. Do I have to keep it a secret as to who<br/><br/>prevails?<br/><br/>The movie is charged with energy and the action doesn't let up<br/><br/>long enough for anyone to groan over the scripts numerous<br/><br/>attempts at machismo-levity in the face of great peril (a hallmark of<br/><br/>Fraser's). In the end, the movie, like its predecessor, strives to be<br/><br/>an Indiana Jones episode. And, as with its predecessor, it comes<br/><br/>off as a 2nd rate imitation. It just tries too hard and the strain bogs<br/><br/>the film down. What's most surprising about this movie is how<br/><br/>disappointing the special effects turn out to be. The seams really<br/><br/>show during several crucial sequences. Most egregious of all is<br/><br/>the CGI figure of the resurrected Scorpion King as a half man/half<br/><br/>scorpion creature. What is supposed to look like The Rock's head<br/><br/>and upper torso, looks like one of the human characters from Toy<br/><br/>Story. Those Ray Harryhausen stop motion creatures from the<br/><br/>Sinbad movies would have been more effective.<br/><br/>I would recommend The Mummy Returns for everyone who enjoyed the first movie. It's not a bad family fright movie either.<br/><br/>While the action may be intense for the smallest movie-age<br/><br/>kiddies, the violence is quite bloodless. Most harrowing for<br/><br/>youngsters might be the scene where the decomposed Imhotep<br/><br/>""sucks"" the skin off of three victims (who kind of deserved it<br/><br/>anyway, in the morality of the narrative) in order to reconstitute his<br/><br/>own flesh. It sounds worse than it actually appears on film, believe<br/><br/>it or not. Actually, so does this movie."

All good horror flicks establish the rules which the good and bad guys cannot pass, which creates suspense and tension.

"faith-26","Null","0","0","21 May 2001"," Sit down, shut up and enjoy it - The Return
","WARNING: There will no doubt be a couple of spoliers for the film here. If you don't want to know what happens then stop reading right now!<br/><br/>Having seen various documentaries about the making of 'The Mummy Returns', it is clear that the enthusiam of Stephen Sommersd and the cast was phenomenal. They had a ball making it, and it shows. This movie is fun. And while, yeah it's great to go and see really heavy emotional/acty pieces such as 'The Sixth Sense', 'Gladiator' e.t.c, there are just some times when you need to see some mindless fun. This is what this movie is and it doesn't pretend likewise.<br/><br/>Personally, have quite an indepth knowledge of the first film, I found The Return was no where near as scary as the original (although tell that to the two friends I went with!) and the plot was more complicated but ultimately didn't work quite as well. On the positive side however, the action sequences (and there are many) were phenomenal and breath-taking, highlights being the bus chase sequence, the battle with the Army of Anubis and the end sequence with the Scorpion King. (Just a little note on that - a lot of people have been unimpressed with the CGI Scorpion King, and while I admit, yeah it would have been better if they'd actually used the Rock's real head and torso, the effects were still pretty 'wow'. I mean there was a definite, 'OH MY GOD!!' moment when he appeared).<br/><br/>Character and actor wise, I was so pleased that so many of the original cast returned (i.e. all those who weren't dead after the first one and a couple who actually were). Brendan Fraser - got the whole action hero thing down really well, nice emotional scenes when Evy was stabbed too. Rachel Weiz - Such a difference in character from this film to the next, great heroine. John Hannah - A little under used, but amusing as always. Arnold Vosloo - He IS the mummy. Won't be able to see him in anything else now without imagine what he looked like part rotted. Oded Fehr - What can I say? The man is attractive and he can act. More please. The Rock - Not in it that long so couldn't really tell. Not sure how well he'll carry Mummy 3. Patricia Velasquez - Okay, so maybe some models CAN act. Freddie Boath - A complete little star. Never too sure about kids in movies. For every Haley-Joel Osmet there's a Jake Lloyd. Freddie Boath was brilliant though, really fun.<br/><br/>Of the more minor actors, Lock-nah was scary and great, and Issy was very funny. Nice to see the Pharoah back too.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, the only part I wasn't sure of was the whole thing about Evy's past life. Seemed a little too coincidental for my liking, even if Ardeth just passed it all off with that handy plot device - fate. Also the opening sequence with the Scorpion King was a little rushed. I would have liked a little more detail.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved and adored this movie. I'm still not quite sure how it compares to the original (since I've seen that about fifty times and this one only once, it's hardly fair to make up my mind quite yet). Without a doubt though I'll be heading off to the cinema again soon enough to get a second dose of this great rollercoaster ride of a film. We aren't going to see anything like this again (bar Tomb Raider of course - almost forgot that) until Indiana Jones 4 comes out, so make the most of this while you can."

","***POTENTIAL SPOILERS****<br/><br/>I would like to make one point before all others and that is, for an SFX movie, the SFX were ropey.  They look like they wouldn't be out of place on Xena. Maybe ILM were rushing through them before Star Wars 2 hit pre-production, but they are just obvious and of poor quality.  When ILM are involved I expect the best groundbreaking effects that can be created.  The first Mummy did, this did not.<br/><br/>Aside from the cheap looking CGI, the story is poor, but I expected that. What does really annoy me is that the screen time is shared equally between about 10 characters.  This ensures that everything that happens is very shallow and uninvolving, because the audience doesn't get to know anyone at all.  The two best characters, Rick O'Connell and Ardeth become watered down heros that just fight a lot and pop up to save the day in the nick of time i.e. they are merely plot functions - no longer the characters we met back in 1998.  The charm of the two characters and their strengths from the first film aren't built upon, but eroded by their minimal screen time.<br/><br/>The child is a waste of screen time who's role in the narrative could have (and should have) been given over to John Hannah's criminally underused character.  In the first film Rachel Weiss made for an excellent damsel in distress, but here she is unable to carry the extra weight.  This may well be more to do with her wafer thin character though, than her talent.  The Mummy himself has but a cameo performance and once again the only word to describe that is 'wasted'.<br/><br/>The character of Lock-Nah is wasted horribly.  Early on he is set up as being someone who is as hard as nails.  About 15 minutes later an for the rest of the film, he becomes comic relief.  This problem runs deep through the film.  Ther isn't a sense of danger in this film.  There is not a single point where you can conceivably doubt that the good guys are going to win. No matter what horrible special effects that they face the audience know full well they will emerge unscathed.  <br/><br/>Another problem with this film is the action.  It is done in a faux Hong Kong style that doesn't work.  Lots of slow motion and the like.  It doesn't work for two reasons.<br/><br/>1) Hong Kong films have done all this before, with smaller budgets and most importantly they have done it BETTER.<br/><br/>2) The Hong Kong style looks out of place in an American film that was supposed to be a homage to old adventure serials.  Stephen Sommers should have stuck with the type of old fashioned action seen in the first film, like the shoot out on the boat.<br/><br/>This whole film reeks of missed opportunities.  I get the impression that this should have been tightened up in post production and the SFX worked on, so that by Christmas or New year they would have an awesome film."

","i enjoyed the first one as a tongue in cheek funny adventure in the style of indiana jones but taking itself even less seriously.  The second completely failed to recognise everything that made the first film any good and was just a hodge podge of ludicrous scenes, immense holes in the plot and a story line that seemed to be being made up as it went along.  The script was mind numbingly bad, the actors had immense trouble with their dialog and some scenes they struggled so badly it was obvious they were people struggling to bring a role to life.   And the addition of the kid was excruciatingly bad.  I've yet to see if it was the same director on both films, but obviously whoever had control of it was given a shedload more money than they knew how to handle but wanted to spend it all anyway.  Some elements of the CGI were good but it was all sensory input and utterly devoid of substance.  It fails on all levels, even as a fantasy action adventure.<br/><br/>The scariest thing is that after nearly 3000 votes, IMDB user rating is 7/10.   That above all makes me mourn humanity."

The problem with a lot of computer games is that they don't have a plot, well dito for Mummy Returns.<br/><br/>It was evident from the first one that Sommers just hasn't got a clue how to write, I mean there are barely any standout moments of dialogue and the fact that it feels like the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles is a bad thing. It feels like an infant has pencilled a few odd words and the whole thing has been jumbled around and strectched into a screenplay. There is simply no struture to the script, not plotting devices, no moments of dramatic tension and no reason for anything that does happen, to actually happen.<br/><br/>The film is bad to worse material. The ever reliable Brendan Frazer is, as ever, reliable. Weisz is OK but Hannah does a risible effort at comedy. There is no point in billing the rock up as he is blink and you'll miss him material. It is a crying shame that so much money should be heaped into such a lame and contrived piece of writing. Fear not though as it is not only writing which is haphazard but the direction itself. Whenever there seems to be some sort of motion to the piece there is an unneeded 10 minutes of slow silent nothingness.<br/><br/>I cannot help but be subjective because the objective opinion would probably make people feel as though this is a decent movie.

This is a 2-hour long action scene with bits of dialogue in between. No matter how good the action is, if the script is as flawed as this one you can't help but yawn in the audience. This movie discarded all the usual principals of basic storytelling. It had no beginning, no turning point, and an end that didn't much differ from the rest of the movie. None of the characters had any backround or any colour. All you could do to describe them would be to tell how they looked. A big black bad guy, A young brit kid, a tall handsome hero. Everything in the movie was just to promote the next action scene. The effects were crap too, by the way. Last years video games have better cgi than this. And since the movie was pretty much 90% digital FX anyway, what's the point in making a live picture out of it. Why not stick with computer animation the whole way?

The waterfall is a simple ripoff of the last Mummy movie, and the skeletons look a lot like the little demons in Gremlins. <br/><br/>One fatal mistake the movie makes is in introducing the typical Annoying Little Kid. This is what singlehandedly sunk another wonderful movie, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1989) had a then-very-young Sarah Polley, and this one has the aforementioned Freddie Boath. Both actors speak with a thick Cockney accent and both have a tendency to get into mischief. But you know that all credibility is tossed kicking and screaming out the window when, in the very first scene, Rick and Evelyn bring little Alex to a spooky temple in their search for this chest, and wouldn't ya know it, they leave HIM out by the entrance. ""Stay here,"" they tell him. What kind of a parent brings their kid to a place like that? Ok, ok, I know it's a movie, but there was simply no reason to have this kid in the movie. He may be a good actor, but the character was unnecessary, unwieldy, and unlikeable. He was also a bit like young Anakin Skywalker from Star Wars, only not as cool. Now Alex had a few good lines and generally acquitted himself nicely, but he was more of a liability than an asset. If anyone should have played the role of buffoon and put the bracelet on (thus incurring all sorts of supernatural wrath), it should have been Jonathan, who was a wonderful surprise from the first. But alas, as is sometimes the case with casting people, they fall in love with cute little kids. Bah!<br/><br/>Don't make the mistake I made and overexamine the movie. I saw some really dumb things, but most of them are inconsequential. There's one I'd like to point out, however: Rick, Jonathan, Ardeth, and Alex are running from the front of the outside of their house around to the side, where their car is. They RUN around the corner, and then the next shot shows them slowing down to a slow walk. Why? So they can discuss what's happened, what they're going to do, and so forth. Never mind that Evelyn's been kidnapped. Never mind that they were all frantic not 1 second ago, and suddenly when they go around the corner, they have time to chat? Sheesh! Such stupidity! Such bad editing!<br/><br/>This very poor man's Indiana Jones isn't terribly inventive, even in its special effects, but it still is roundly entertaining. You could do far worse for two and a half hours."

","I was very impressed with the quality of the plot and the script.  I was very disappointed with the ending effects.  In the beginning you can plainly see the scorpion king is being played by of course ""The Rock.""  But near the end, it is painfully obvious that the entire Scorpion King sequence was done in Computer Generated Graphics (CGI) and it looked SO FAKE!!!  The artwork was handled well but it seems that a few people got lazy, especially when they could have blue-screened ""The Rock's"" torso and head and plugged that into the CGI sequence.  Other than that, it was a pretty good movie.  So I say to the producers, ""Kudos."""

","Everything from the first film was there.  Yes, there were the cornball one-liners and banal dialog.  Yes, there was the Mummy.  Yes, there were some great special effects and stuntwork.  And yes, there was the requisite comic relief, this time represented by John Hannah and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje.  Everything that made the first film a work of mindless, popcorn munching, B-movie fun was there.  <br/><br/>But somehow, it didn't quite click.  The first one was thrilling, funny, and entertaining, albeit in a turn-your-brain-off kind of way.  The sequel is... well, it's somewhat thrilling, kind of funny, and I guess moderately entertaining.  However, compared to the first, the film lacked a little focus.  I presume the filmmakers tried to follow one of the common sequel ""formulas""- that is, take everything in the first film and make it 100 times bigger.  Make it wall to wall action, and even throw a little bit of globe trotting in.  More thrills, more cheesy one liners, more special effects. You think the face in the sandstorm was cool last time?  Well, we'll do something like that but even better.  <br/><br/>But in the efforts to make the film bigger and better, even less thought was gone into making it than the first film.  Some of the action scenes, while thrilling, also seemed a little superfluous and arbitrary, and as a result it lacked a sense of urgency that some of the best scenes in the first film had.  And while they were quite well done and entertaining, many of the fight scenes as well as the special effects felt like they were already accomplished in the first movie.  (The only notable improvement in the CGI is in the mummy's not-fully-formed stages, which is probably the most underused CGI in the film) The one liners were funny, but were said a little too often with a wink-wink-nudge-nudge that it can go from amusing to somewhat arrogant.  And while Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as the black pilot and Freddie Boath as the kid were surprisingly entertaining, I got to be a little annoyed with John Hannah.<br/><br/>This film had all the ingredients of its predecessor, and yet it fell a little short.  Was it a horrible movie?  No.  Did I find it entertaining? Mmmm... I _guess_ so.  Just not as much as I'd hoped to be after watching the first film.  Would I recommend it?  I'm not sure."

","I find it hilarious that people actually expected this film to have some sort of redeeming value greater than that of the first Mummy. Why should it? All the filmmakers did with Mummy Returns was cash in on what worked in the first movie. There was more of everything: more heros, more villians, more effects, more mummys, more locations, and enough plot twists to sink the Titanic twice. Still, it was all in good fun. I laughed my head off at the cheesy dialogue the actors were forced to say, as well as at a lot of the situations. Maybe the things I laughed at weren't intentionally funny, but the movie still left me highly entertained, and well worth the hour and a half i spent in line for it. I was disappointed, however, in the cop-out wall of water effect. If the movie makers were going to cash in on the sand from the first movie, they could have at least made it visually believeable. It worked when it was sand. It was simply annoying as water. The scorpion king climax also left something to be desired... CG people have yet to be perfected. Other than that, the movie contained everything I expected: cheese, cheese, and more cheese. I went into it knowing I wasn't going to discover the meaning of life just by watching the movie, and wasn't disappointed in that respect at all. It makes for a nice start to the summer of the sequel. Let's hope it's not all downhill from here, there are a lot more to come."

To me it was Army of Darkness (a personal favorite) with a bigger budget.  The sequel is pathetic.  If it weren't for the humor (which is the only spectacular element in the film), I'd have rated it as a 3.  The CGI effects looked no better than those in the the original.  In the time between the films, computer animation has grown by leaps and bounds, but it's impossible to tell from The Mummy Returns. These improvements can be seen in the differences between Toy Story and its sequel.  I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when I saw the animated version of the Rock as a scorpion.  It brought new meaning to the word ""suck"".  AND THAT'S JUST THE EFFECTS!  The plot was nonexistent, the characters were cardboard, and the action sequences (the only things keeping the film going) were contrived.

A hollow movie devoid of any real storyline with some of the worst acting I have seen in years - hardly surprising given the leaden script. The movie fails abysmally (as did the first one) because it can't decide whether to play it entirely for fun or go for genuine shocks.

","This movie was god-awful. With a budget of a hundred million dollars one would think that there would be enough to hire a decent team of writers. Judging by the way the story is told in the Mummy Returns it was just made up as they went along.  I realize that its an adventure movie and should be watched as such but without solid believable characters to hold it up, the unbelievable story crumbles to pieces. Indiana Jones was in some pretty ridiculous situations as well but the writing was good and we believed those situations.  The Mummy Returns is another example of the unfortunate actions of Hollywood. ""Who cares if its good it'll make a fortune anyway"" So if your thinking of going to see this movie go outside set down your eight bucks in the middle of the road and set a fire with it.

The little kid is, like most little kids in the movies, roughly 7,000 times smarter than any of the adults in the picture, far too smart to really be 8 years old, full of ""hilarious"" wisecracks, and massively annoying.<br/><br/>The ultimate problem, though, is that it doesn't really succeed as a summertime special effects movie - it doesn't contain a single FX shot that made me sit up and take notice.  Granted, this is becoming harder and harder to do, but ""The Mummy Returns"" didn't even try.  They just had all the same effects from the first movie, except more of them.<br/><br/>But there were some swordfights, lots of shootouts, plenty of monsters, and the volume was turned way, way up.

The creepy crawly flesh-eating bugs are back, but after seeing them in the 1st movie, they're now less effective than they were the first time. That great special effect from the first movie, when the Mummy commands the swirling sands as the howling outline of his face becomes visible, has now been colored blue & we see the same effect with water instead of sand. My, how original! There's only a few minutes of the ""Mummy"" in tattered bandages on screen, before he reverts to his youthful looking self, but who would notice? There's too many other bad guys out there to pay attention to a detail like that. We have the Mummy bad guy, the Anubis bad guy, the Scorpion King bad guy, & the Mummy's Girlfriend bad gal. Some of the baddies even fight each other instead of fighting the good guys. I'm surprised they didn't use all that extra ""plot"" material to make four movies instead of just this one. If you like mindless, redundant action films, this is definitely for you. If you like a bare minimum of a plot & a degree of originality, look elsewhere, or if you want some real acting & real atmosphere, watch the 1932 version with Boris Karloff.

O.k., the effects are  - most of the time - excellent - except the badly animated Scorpion King during the show-down -, but what the movie really suffers from is the missing plot. You can guess almost any scene in the movie. The acting only helps the story to jump from one effect-scene to the next. Too many special effects destroy a movie and it seems like Hollywood doesn't understand this at all. The movie's an entertaining thrill-ride worth spending two hours in the cinema, but you'll forget about the movie the next day, because it's a heartless movie that totally lacks innovation and surprises. The pros of the film are: Patricia Velasquez, some very funny scenes.

Much of the action and atmosphere were similar to Indiana Jones, and it was well scripted and acted.<br/><br/>But this sequel lost most of the best stuff, what a pile of tripe!<br/><br/>First and very importantly is the fact that the special effects are either the same design as the first film (or even stolen from other films....Velociraptors in the tall grass!!) or.....oooh the shame with such a large budget.....unbelievably poor!! It at times looked more like those really old movies where they just stuck a screen behind the actors that showed lots of scenery, I'm talking big thick black matte lines here!!<br/><br/>Also, admittedly I have a thing against children in films (most of them just can't act they simply imitate what they see older actors doing and therefore don't come across natural or like the children they portray), but here the kid always looks like he wants to start laughing.  All he does is come out with all the wise cracks that would normally be given to Fraser's character, and so they are totally out of place and not as funny.<br/><br/>The Rock is hardly in it, the acting is mediocre at best, it drags on too much, like too many films it has inferior Matrix style fight sequences in (why oh why does every action film see a need to have martial arts that looks unrealistic and is too fast to look stylish because its just blurry images on the screen?), steals ideas and lines form other films in a way that doesn't do them justice to be a compliment.<br/><br/>It was just a big disappointment, there were hardly any laughs or screams in the full cinema theatre and everyone walked out as fast as possible.<br/><br/>I have only seen two worse films at the cinema, Street Fighter the Movie and Maybe Baby and both were really bad!!!"

","Two of the best elements of the original Mummy were great effects and a bad ass monster. I loved the Mummy in the original. He was tough, mean, quick, had plenty of cool tricks up his sleeve, and most importantly: he was damn menacing. The Mummy returns in the sequel but is considerably tamer. The action sequences involving him are considerably lamer, and the effects much poorer in both quality and originality.  <br/><br/>The opening intro telling the tale of the Scorpion King is the only time this movie really shines in both terms of interest and CGI effects. The rest of the movie's plot and special effects seem to have been just slapped together as fast and haphazardly as possible. <br/><br/>The plot is considerably lamer than the original (not to mention much more incoherent and with even greater continuity problems). The curator of Evie's museum along with a bunch of not too interesting henchmen are digging up the Mummy to fight the Scorpion King to gain control of the army of Annubis. Once they have control they are going to (get ready for the shocker) *gasp* try to take over the world. <br/><br/>There is some ridiculous subplot about the Evie being the direct descendant (identical twin no less) of the murdered Pharaoh's daughter. She starts having visions that provide information to plod the ridiculous plot along. Imoteph's (the Mummy) girlfriend has been reincarnated. How/Why is never explained. The viewer is supposed to accept this on blind faith. Another ridiculous new element is suddenly Frasier has a holy stamp on his hand that makes him a chosen warrior of God....where were these elements in the first movie? <br/><br/>Rick and Evie are now the perfect (and excessively boring) nuclear family with a young kid who I think is supposed to be Anakin Skywalker. The dialogue gets a 10 on the cheese scale. All the good guys are completely uninteresting. The bad guys aren't menacing in the least.  The effects are lackluster best, and the incoherent plot has holes big enough to drive a Buick through. <br/><br/>The final showdown sported the worst effects of the whole movie. The Scorpion King was pretty lame and looked like something you'd see on a Playstation.  <br/><br/>FINAL RATING: 5/10 A generally mediocre presentation of what could have been a good sequel. Somewhat entertaining but doesn't hold a candle to the original."

","THE MUMMY was a surprise hit in 1999. It at all of the elements of the great INDIANA JONES films with a lot of originality. Plus the characters were all likeable and the dialogue was extremely witty.  This year, we are presented with THE MUMMY RETURNS, a highly disappointing sequel that is loud, noisy and impersonal. <br/><br/>The movie opens with background information on The Scorpion King. This is handled well and this movie could have been just about him. Then, without ever getting a title credit, we move to Egypt of 1933. We already see our heroes stumbling upon relics that relate to The Scorpion King. They find an artifact and take it with them, but unknowingly start a booby trap. Needless to say, they escape back to London with their son, who places the artifact on his wrist and has 7 days to find The Scorpion Kings lair before he dies. This is an interesting movie itself, but no, we forgot about The Mummy. Well, an Anck-Su-Namun look-a-like and others try to resurrect The Mummy so that he can kill The Scorpion King and be `more powerful.' Confused? I sure was.<br/><br/>The plot to THE MUMMY RETURNS is simply a mess. It has too much going on and doesn't stop to let you relate and enjoy the characters. They give you just enough plot to put action sequences around them. The dialogue, while clever at times, is delivered horribly to even attempt to be witty or interesting. Sure, they are saying something but we really don't care, because if it isn't a Mummy soldier chasing them, it is little pigmy skeletons pulling everyone down under the grass similar to the raptor scene in JURASSIC PARK II.  The things that made the first one so good (fun characters, good acting) are abandoned for non-stop and numbing action sequences. And on top of that, the movie isn't scary at all. At least the first film had its tense moments. And when the story tries to be tender and serious, you can't help but think, `It'll be OK.' <br/><br/>The special effects are also a problem. It seems as if the filmmakers want to show the effects to you so quickly that they abandon all tension or horror that the first film tried. You can help but think of the droid army in THE PHANTOM MENANCE when you see the `dog' army in the desert. How many times do we need to see a mummy or another creature stretch their mouth open wide? It was done a lot in the first film. Seeing it now didn't make it more interesting. And when we finally see The Scorpion King, we are just so overwhelmed that we just want it to be over. <br/><br/>It was fun seeing the characters again and how they changed. O'Connell didn't change much. He was given some parental instincts, but the script made them seem forced. Evelyn is much more physical than she was before. She isn't afraid to make a fist and fight and some of this leads to her interesting past. Jonathan is back but he is given the worst dialogue, so it makes him look even more idiotic. The rest of the cast does a good job but is given little to do, including The Mummy himself. <br/><br/>I just can't help but feel disappointed and bored with THE MUMMY RETURNS. If they had taken the time to stop and let us enjoy the characters rather than the effects, this could have been a better film."

Can't wait till the third installment of the brilliant 'Mummy'. I give The Mummy Returns a 10/10. Great film!"

","Time for truth...Along with the Aliens, Mummy Returns is definitely better-than-its-original sequel that we're not oftenly see. All of the original cast has returned, and gave their unique, brilliant performances. Brendan Fraser is superb as always, I think he is the future Bruce Willis in movie industry, Rachel Weisz performance is at the top (Evelyn character somehow improved and became more smarter), John Hannah is the comic relief just like he was in the first film, Oded Fehr is very cool as Ardeth Bay and finally Arnold Vosloo as Priest Imhotep is great as he was in the first. Among the newly introduced characters, the boy Alex was brilliant all the way. The story of *minor spoiler* Imhotep, Anck Su Namun and Nefertari cleverly revealed, and all the loose ends were tied together completely. You can find all that you want; action, humor, thrill, tense, jump scenes, great visual effects, story twists...The only thing I complain about is *minor spoiler* about The Scorpion King. He has very little screen time and at the end when we see his *major spoiler* scorpion form, the visual effects are not quite good compared to the other visualization in the whole picture. Other than that, Mummy Returns is a worthy sequel that really deserved to be seen. I saw it, and I will see it again."
"Daryk_Stone","10","0","0","16 May 2001"," The Pros and Cons of The Ultimate sequel to ""The Mummy""
","The Mummy Returns was an excellent movie. I thought that it was better than the sequel. There are several reasons why it was so great. The action scenes were superb. The special effects were totally awesome. There are many more reasons as well.<br/><br/>One thing that ticks me off is that everyone expects a `Ghandi' plot. I thought the storyline fit the movie. What we must remember is that this is NOT `Ghandi', this is an action movie. Did any of the Star Wars movies have good storylines? I THINK NOT! All the Star Wars series had was a unknowingly powerful man goes on a long adventure to save a princess and the world.<br/><br/>Another thing that I quite like is that the director used generally the same cast. One good thing was that Rick and Evelyn stayed together, and had a child. Usually sequels create a downfall relationship not shown in the movie so they may either get rid of some of the cast and / or restart the relationships.<br/><br/>The only thing that I did not like was the end scene with the Scorpion King. He was a giant scorpion with the head of Dwayne Johnson (The Rock). You could totally tell that his head was completely computer generated; it didn't seem to fit. The Scorpion King was not in the movie enough.<br/><br/>Another thing that ticks me off is that people only want to see what they want to see in the sequel. They come up-in their mind-what they want the sequel to be like. Then when it doesn't happen, they complain. This is just like `Star Wars Episode One'. The Writers are the story tellers, NOT YOU!!!"

","you waited it, it now arrived the entertainment of the summer (and the year). But which says entertainment does not say necessarily intelligent.<br/><br/>Writer and director, Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, Deep Rising) reiterate his bet, that of concocter a diverting film, a giant blockbuster, a cinematographic carcass made up immenses blocks... with much money (95 million dollars spent well in the circumstances).<br/><br/>In fact, one associates (always) movie of year with pure american entertainment; Could The Mummy Returns does not dislodge with the rule, how it? One often says that blockbuster has the resources which do one of them, but this one wants to be the cream of the cream.<br/><br/> Characters attaching, coloured and alive, slight amount of romantic, mirobolants effects and three-dimensional, well introduced humour, history folded back with simplest without possible confusion (interesting and comprehensible, this is not what I seek this kind of production?); ambiance total appears dynamic, thorough, energetic and visually splendid and spectacular.<br/><br/>All the estival ingredients pullulate in this Hollywood production (turned mainly to Africa and England) for our greater pleasure. If he's necessary to have waiting, that's to be diverted well of the whole beginning to the any end, nothing else. If you move for other thing, you knocked with bad... fall. No ounce of reflexion, therefore impossible to split hairs; no chance to win oscar, therefore it will not pass to history and its later range will not be deep. Can one be upset with him with the scenario writer not to have thought of including a certain psychological level? Never, that's an entertainment. The only reason so that we  remember it in the years to come will be the seal collected with the box office (68, 1 million dollars during a weekend. WOW! ).<br/><br/>Mainly, which is worth the turning, it is that the film makes us pass one excellent moment - on this subject, I will lie down month tightened this evening. Except for exception (Terminator II), rare are the films which enjoy a sequel to offer the package to us whose container dazzles us, does not leave us indifferent, wants to be higher than its baby; a sequel which does not leave us perplexed.<br/><br/>In what milked with story just as it is, it is necessary to remember the first episode, but that of the second does not want to be complicated. I would say that it is is higher than this type of production. Does the scenario writer take necessary time to analyse, to explain and then to show us the continuation of the events... special effects. The narrative frame thus is well wrapped by the orgy of the visual effects, and the characters who make it up, installation to attract crowd. <br/><br/>At all events, the only thing of which you must remember is it is about an ENTERTAINMENT, a big BLOCKBUSTER (as they are liked), nothing else. Remember this. If the first were compared with new Indiana Jones (not for me in any case), the second appears out of this category. If the producers want to copy this famous archaeologist, they must go to be repaired; they are beside the "" track "" and have not completely to find the whip corresponding - I prefer to await the fourth of the series Indiana Jones. The return of the mummy is an action movie which is caught for an adventure movie. There is the great negative point. history told definitely lower and is thought than his false friend; it is less true, less historical, less serious, less dramatic and less adventurous in more than the contribution humorous less and not very subtle (but it is very effective...). And is it not there that you say that one is a movie adventure and the other is an action movie, disguised that one to me? I love you, one thus returns to the starting point, sensational...<br/><br/>What disappoints in the movie prove the end (the interior final scene frontwith Mr WWF disguised in scorpion for the needs for film... ridiculous but obvious). we almost don't believe. The effects are atrocious, null and incredible (undoubtedly only the most negative pushing back).<br/><br/>
Then with you to judge if you will then move (after having seen this of course film, because you must see it entertainment to perfect your psychology) for the third opus of the Mummy which will be entitled - with less that it changed - THE SCORPION KING (currently in turning) with The Rock itself and Michael Clarke Duncan (the giant of THE GREEN LINE) planned initially for fall 2001, but without the original actors...<br/><br/>

","This is a piece of entertainment that could have gone down one of two roads: cringe-worthy garbage, or worthy successor. luckily, for me at least, the latter would appear to be the result. much has been said about the FLAWS in the place. for those who wish to make certain everything in this film GELS with everything in the prior one, just take another look at the original. much like the GODFATHER series, the Stephen Sommers written/directed MUMMY saga seems to be one continuous story. this film will fill in some gaps, open new questions, but mostly it will simply bring you enjoyment, if you have any sense of wonder left. DO NOT go into this thinking it will be deep or meaningful. that's not to say it is shallow, but rather that it is what it is: good, solid entertainment. The film is much broader in scope than the original, the production values, as high as they were on the previous entry, are obviously much higher. there are moments in the film that seem a little far fetched, but then that's the point of it all. Personally, I could have done without The Rock, but, then again, it doesn't take much to pull off his role. aside from that, I highly recommend it."

","Though the movie was not as good as the original, what sequel is these days? However it was not a particularly bad film. It had it's positive aspects and it's negative ones. Yes there were times in the film where I absolutely wanted to walk on out and vomit, but there were also times when I was at the edge of my seat and biting my nails.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns had three basic problems: The lack of emphasis on imotep. (this is The Mummy Returns for the love of god and the last I checked Imotep was the mummy)The second main problem with the film was the son of Rick and Eve O'connel who would always find a new way to get into trouble no matter what. Did I mention he was annoying. And last but not least we come to the fact that they decided to place The Rock into the film as the scorpion king. Why they wanted to place a wrestler from WWF into the film and give him no lines at all is beyond me.<br/><br/>Other then the three weaknesses found in the film above it's quite a decent piece of work. The plot picks up as the film progresses and the special effects are phenominal. All the actors aside from the little kid put an honest effort into the film to make the film work on so many levels. Children will love the action and humor and adult males will love the shots of Rachel Wies' clevage. Women will love any shot with Brendan Fasier in it.<br/><br/>All in all the good parts of the film outweigh the bad and in the end you'll most likely approve of it."

","OK, as an action film, it was enjoyable.  Yes it suffers from ""Sequel-itis"". It was fun to watch.  Enjoyable characters, great effects (most of the time-Scorpion King was poorly done).   <br/><br/>My big problem with the movie was the ""bad guys"".  The film-makers decided to go with excess.  In other words, there were a lot of different bad guys, each with their own agenda.  Of course, this made the task our heros face very daunting.  They were successful in this.  However, if you look at each of the characters one by one, and you consider that each one is supposed to be the epitome of all evil, each was far too easily vanquished.  Imhotep, the title character, himself turns into a cowardly, sniveling weasel, therefore making him one of the least significant of the baddies! <br/><br/>
Plot holes galore, but that is to be expected in any film of this type. Just a celebration of excess that could have been done better with some restraint.  Still enjoyable to watch, but try not to think of it as a great movie, and you will be better off.  Give it a try."

Lots of action, adventure, suspense, and the right amount of humor at just the right time.<br/><br/>But The Mummy Returns doesn't carry the same magic that made The Mummy such a wonderful hit. It's more of a action thrill ride (though there's nothing wrong with that) where The Mummy was a action filled horror film. In this sequel the horror part of the story is replaced with more fighting and more special effects. While this does make a good movie it change from The Mummy's creepier look.<br/><br/>You you go see The Mummy Returns looking for the next film in the mummy horror genre you may be disappointed.

","Don't be fooled by all the noise: this sequel is a mess.  Very few genuine thrills and not a single good scare (or laugh for that matter), but crammed with computer generated special effects that - surprise - look like nothing more than computer generated special effects.  Some of these look cheap and hastily thrown together, especially those involving the growth and later destruction of an oasis.  Others, like the many shots of marauding hordes crossing the desert, already feel old hat.  This does not bode well for the future of cgi-generated armies.<br/><br/>This movie steals from everywhere: Brendan Fraser's Rick O'Connell borrows heavily from Indiana Jones, and the parallel is driven home early on by music that embarrassingly plagiarizes John William's ""Indy"" theme.  There are also a number of strained references to the prior Mummy film, for example, when O'Connell's overly-precocious young son causes the pillars in a tomb to tumble down in a domino effect, it takes awhile to realize this is a joke, one that hearkens back to the first film when his mother (Rachel Weisz) similarly destroys a research library.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie where the good guys survive impossible odds because the bad guys are bad shots (or swordsmen, in this case).  Three different times - once on foot and twice in an airship - the heroes out race rushing water.  ""It's just fun!"" people say.  ""It's supposed to be a cartoon.""  Yet fantasy without internal logic is boring.  Somehow by the end of the film, not only does it seem that all the actors have been under utilized, but so has our time."

The action sequences are all terrifically well thought out, and the plot is huge and epic and sweeping. It's nice to see a summer film with such grand designs. What makes the film truly excel is the wonderful attention to small details as well as big, and the way multiple storylines are woven together seamlessly. Steven Sommers deservedly has another big hit on his hands. This film raises the bar on Summer 2001. It's doubtful anything will be able to compete on a quality level with this film this summer."

","When i watch this at the cinema with some friends, almost all of them thought that the original mummy was much better.  To tell you the truth, i was not a big fan of the first mummy movie.  I thought the the ""mummy"" (the main bad guy) was rather weak and not scary at all, as he was supposed to be.<br/><br/>In the mummy returns, the ""mummy"" was still just as weak but i thought he was more acceptable here since he had a human side to him now, he had a love relationship with the snake woman, which was somehow connected to Evelyn, the main female character, (there is some attempts at a story).  Also, he was vulnerable at the end which made him gave him more human qualities.<br/><br/>As you can tell from my comments, i have no idea what most of the character's names are, character not greatly emphasized in the movie.  In fact, the most interesting character in this movie was the ""mummy"" himself. It was also better than the first installment since it had a nice intro explaining how the scorpion king came about to getting his powers.<br/><br/>One part of the movie i have to congratulate them on (no matter how out of place it was) is the balloon scene at night, it looked really cosy with the stars in the background and kerosene lamps hanging around.  There were also many gripping scenes in the movie, many ""close encounters"", which were similar to the ""t-rex chasing car"" scene from jurassic park.  Sure, the plot was a little hard to follow (what plot?), but the fast paced action and CG kept me on the edge of my seat.  Also, has stephen sommers even seen indiana jones and the last crusade??  the guy at the end is not supposed to get the diamond, hes supposed to drop it or something cos its too heavy.  nb, i can tell it was fake from the back row.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie could of had some nice character development with an interesting plot, and a FEW memorable suspense/action sequences... but full on action is fine too i guess.

I only saw it on DVD after Christmas, and I loved it.<br/><br/>I was afraid ""The Mummy Returns"" would be disappointing, as sequels so often are, and then I heard Ebert and Roeper both panned it, while they love ""A Knight's Tale"" (the trailers of which set my teeth on edge.)  So, I was really leery when I went into the theater.<br/><br/>I LOVED it.  So Izzy's accent was too cultured for his character?  His character was building dirigibles in the middle of nowhere.  Gee, he must have been someplace civilized.  So Evie is a little more buxom?  It's now the 1930s and she's almost ten years older.  So why was the curator working for Imhotep?  Try power and the anticipation of helping Imhotep run the world.  You need to have that spelled out for you?  Evie's fighting abilities are explained in the plot.  Jonathan may be a cad, but he comes through in the clutch (and he HAS made the adventures profitable for our heroes, both times.)<br/><br/>I have a degree in anthropology.  When I was a kid, I read everything I could on ancient Egypt and I still keep up on it.  (I remember reading a passage on how to embalm a mummy to my mother at the lunch table.) But I still can appreciate Fantasy Ancient Egypt.  I'll put this movie's Eqyptian scenes up to both ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""The Egyptian.""  It's light years beyond ""Land of the Pharoahs"" - and Patrician Velazguez sure has Joan Collins beat.<br/><br/>Any of you read the Amelia Peabody series of books by Elizabeth Peters?  I think Rick, Evie and their son bear a passing resemblance to Emerson, Amelia and their son, Ramses.  No plagiarism, but I think someone with a hand in the script has read those books, too.<br/><br/>There was a British film company from the 1930s-40s that started their films with a man striking a big gong.  Can't remember the company name, but somebody in the production of this movie sure did.<br/><br/>I will admit that the Scorpion King looked like he escaped from the ""Screk"" trailer.<br/><br/>So, all of you people agonizing about plot and character and lighting and nuance and what they had on the set for lunch, go make comments on ""Shadow of the Vampire"" and let the rest of us enjoy ourselves."

"Nigel St. Buggering","5","0","0","5 May 2001"," ""The Mummy"" times ten, for better or worse
","If you didn't care for ""The Mummy"", this one won't appeal to you either. Despite a several-year gap and changes in character relationships, there's very little difference here.  The same flip attitude, the same everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink approach.  The only difference is an increase in budget, and thus in the proliferation of special effects.  And therein lies the main problem.<br/><br/>This film is a prime example of the principle that just because you CAN put something on the screen, it doesn't mean that you SHOULD.  The filmmakers have a serious problem with restraint; when flesh-eating bugs appear, they can't just show enough to kill people...there has to be a boiling flood of them.  They can't just have a tribe of pygmy zombies chase the characters, there have to be a few hundred.  When Anubis' warriors arrive, they must coat the landscape.  After a while, the effect defeats itself, and it becomes impossible to feel impressed with the scale.<br/><br/>Another problem lies in underestimating the audience.  There are far too many ""surprises"" here that we can see coming over the horizon, and yet the filmmakers insist on drawing out the ""suspense"", convinced that we don't know what's about to happen.  Not to print spoilers, but suffice to say, when the plot revolves around resurrection, death is hardly much of a threat.<br/><br/>Finally, on a minor note, the much-ballyhooed appearance of The Rock (is he going to start using his name anytime soon?) induces more chuckles than thrills.  The role comprises perhaps five minutes of film time, and his only dialogue is in Egyptian.  And even under these modest demands, his performance fails to impress.

","I may be wrong, but I thought I saw something  at the begining of the scene in the British Museum. Several mummies in cases are lined up along the wall. The first one, perhaps all, were in the exact pose as the Mummy in the Boris Karlof classic original, the Mummy as found in his coffin."

","Some of the movies that are the most fun to watch are the action adventure films that come out each summer. They cram lots of special effects, fighting, running and everything else that makes a movie vibrate into about 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that rarely makes these summer flicks *good* movies. Even allowing for the mindlessness of a summer film, I had a hard time with aspects of Mummy 2. I gave it a 6, and only because of the fact it was intended to be a summer film.<br/><br/>First, I don't know what Brendan Fraser is doing, but his portrayal of an action hero in the Indiana Jones tradition is awkward. Fraser bounces back and forth between sentimental husband and savy adventurer, able to snatch snakes and knives out of the air. He even *walks* funny, kind of hunched over, gorilla-like. The sequel (and the original) make great efforts to tell us, through dialogue, that Fraser's character is blunt and more likely to fight and ask questions later than think his way out of a tough situation. And yet this same character is so sensitive to his wife, and so aware of the needs of those around him, that his ""action guy"" mode seems out of place. He is too smart and too caring to be the fearless hero.<br/><br/>Second, why in the world did this movie create a very cheesy ""scorpion king monster"" in the finale? That was probably the most fake looking monster, especially the face (which was The Rock's face, sort of), I have seen since that 1982ish movie about Perseus and the Greek gods who manipulated him. You kept expecting this scorpion thing to speak, and we had several close-ups of the enraged face, but all it ever did was roar. And this was supposed to be the latest version of a great warrior bent on taking over the world? He seemed as smart as a rock (no pun intended).<br/><br/>Finally, several actors/roles were all wrong, or at least not done well. Izzy, the dirigible-for-hire guy, was supposed to provide comic relief, I guess. But his delivery and English accent were far too sophisticated to be convincing for the kind of rogue-for-hitre character he played. The character who was curator at the British museum and as well as the person who was bringing Ahotep back from the dead made no sense. What was his motivation? We never saw Ahotep reward anyone except his woman. Why help him?<br/><br/>Still, the movie was loud, fast and mostly fun, even if it made little sense. If you're trying to escape the summer heat, check out a matinee."

","Bigger! Louder! Dumber! More! Before you have time to be confused they'll be on to the next bit! It's to be expected I guess; the only way to out-do the first one is to chuck any shred of historical feel (plus the pace, the dialogue and spread the CG budget so thin it looks like Babylon 5 at times). In the first few sequences it's obvious what happened; using every male bodybuilder in the world as an extra forced them to blow out the catering budget on protein shakes. This movie lacked any thrilling aspect, any tension. The leads felt like they were in a dull bubble of safety no matter how many times they were kidnapped (which was a lot), being shot at (also a lot) or dangling from somewhere dangerous (which seemed to happen anywhere they were more than a metre above sea level). Sure, in this kind of matinee pulp we all ""know"" that the good guys are going to make it, but there can still be the odd thrill of risk and close shaves. The only guy who seemed to be working for a living in this was Oded Fehr, as the long suffering Ardeth Bey. He probably got the lowest pay rise after the first one and then he has to carry the film! A pity really, since the bad guys were pretty good for the most part. Patricia Velasquez and Arnold Vosloo (playing crazy dead people) had more humanity than their white hatted counterparts. (*spoilers!*)<br/><br/>And what the hell is wrong with letting them live?!  Can't we skip the resurrection schtick for just one film (the next one)? Or at least reduce it a little.  The amount of time it took in this one didn't help.  The next one will need a score card.<br/><br/>(/spoilers)<br/><br/>It's tough to talk about films like this and criticizing them without the suggestion that you've taken it too seriously. You're supposed to relax and go along with it. Well that's what the first one did, it was Raiders of the Lost Ark meets Army of Darkness. It was bright and breezy and had lots of character. The Mummy Returns just makes the first one look good. It's silly fun and it will do very well but this time it's too much silly, too little fun."

","I didn't really know what to expect from The Mummy Returns. On one hand, it had the potential to be a work of art, taking what was built from the original movie and adding to it. On the other hand, it could be another tired rehash of the same film. In the end it was a bit of both.<br/><br/>The film certainly looks very nice. The special effects (with the exception of the Scorpion King) are superb and really convey a sense of power. Imhotep and his effects are handled very nicely.<br/><br/>There is very little, if any, character development in the film. That said, a lot of background information left out of the original is provided and some questions about the first film are answered. This is a lot of fun for those who like tie-ins to other films. However, a lot of the jokes used in the original are reused here (homage, or rehash?)<br/><br/>The plot premise is believable and the scriptwriters did a good job of providing everyone with a reason to be in the film. Plot inconsistencies are rare. I've seen a lot worse lately (e.g. Red Planet).<br/><br/>If you're an action fan, look no further. This film is non-stop. In fact, there's almost too much of it. We don't get the chance to stop and take a breather for much of the film. Unfortunately, that means that the journey is largely glossed over in favour of hacking and slaying (not that that's a bad thing).<br/><br/>Overall I felt that it was a good film, provided that you've seen the original. Those seeing this alone will probably not get as much out of it. 7/10"

","The Mummy returns is getting some bad critic reviews.  This just convinces me more that critics don't know what the hell they're talking about.  Before I saw this film on opening night, I watched The Mummy on DVD. Usually this just gets me hyped for the sequel only to have my hopes brutally destroyed once the film starts.  But The Mummy Returns holds its own with the original.  And very well.<br/><br/>The basic plot is this:  Four thousand years ago, a powerful warrior called the Scorpion King (The Rock) led an army that was defeated after a seven year siege.  He pledges his soul to Anubis, god of death, in exchange for another army to destroy his enemies, after which his soul is sucked into limbo to await his awakening.  Supposedly taking place nine years after the first film, Rick O'Connel (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn (Rachel Weisz)have married and have an eight year old son, Alex.  Alex finds the bracelet of the Scorpion King, which sets off a chain of events culminating in the King's resurrection in 7 days.  Whomever kills this warrior will gain control of his invincible army.  So starts the race between the O'Connels and the villains, led my the reincarnation of Imhotep's girlfriend Anck-su-namun, who want to resurrect the mummy again as he is the only one strong enough to defeat the Scorpion King.  Wackiness ensues.<br/><br/>I think many critics hate this film because they're expecting either a detailed plot or a horror film.  This is an action movie, plain and simple. Things blow up, guns fire, and mummies roar like the damned.  And it's FUN. The actor's performances are excellent, particularly Freddie Boath as Alex O' Connel who is 1000% percent better than that annoying and talentless kid in the last Star Wars film.  The effects are excellent (with one exception, but I won't bitch about it here), Stephen Sommers' direction is flawless.  I had a few minor gripes with the film, but nothing major and I didn't really even notice them until the second time I saw it. Mainly though, there's the sense of humor.  Like the original, The Mummy Returns doesn't take itself too seriously, making many jokes about and even parodying it's predecessor once or twice.  I do wonder how they will make The Scorpion King as a spin off vehicle for The rock, when he has ten minutes of screen time here, only two lines (in ancient Egyptian I might add) and plays the most undetailed, cardboard cutout character ever.<br/><br/>Face it people, action films will always be made, and this is how they should be done."

","I'll grant that Mummy Returns lacks a bit of script and story spark that drove the first film, but it makes up for it by adding in some good villains, tons of action, and a spirit of adventure.  As someone who grew up on Harryhausen-style fantasy fables (like the Sinbad films), I can confidently say that Mummy returns is probably the closest modern cinema has come to that age of pure adventure, when it was all about the heroes taking on supernatural evils and such.  All the flaws here amount to virtually diddly squat compared to the sheer bang for the buck you get.  Like the 1998 Mummy film, what we have here is a wonderful, ""pulp"" serial adventure, harkening back to the days of jungle adventures and such.  Mummy is often criticized for borrowing a lot from other movies, but yet oddly enough, it does it better than the movies it's borrowing from.  I also hear Indiana Jones rip-off, bandied around alot, failing to note that Indiana Jones was, itself, a tribute to classic adventure serials, and ripped off tons of stuff from those.  Ignore the critics on this one, because they seem to be taking the wrong view of this kind of movie.  I could see bad reviews if this were touted as a Shakespearean masterpiece or a triumph of Oscar-worthy acting, but it isn't.  At no time has this film ever been advertised as anything but a fantasy adventure, pure and simple.  Why is it so hard for people to make that division between works that SHOULD be artistically examined, and works that shouldn't?  As a sequel, Mummy Retusn promised more action as the Mummy comes back to wreak havoc.  Did it deliver that?  Yes. No argument."

It started you off on a roller coaster ride and didn't let up until the credits rolled. The plot was a little thin, but who cared! There were enough thrills, chills, spills, and laughs to more than make up for it. Brendan Frasier was great and Oded Fehr was wonderfully dark and sexy. There was that terrific chemistry between Rick and Evie and I thought Evie's brother Jonathan was hysterically inept and greedy but ultimately heroic. Little Alex was a wonderful addition to the cast and not just a child character used to make up for shortcomings in the script.  The final poignant scenes of Im-Ho-Tep and Anck-Su-Namun were surprising showing a redeming side of him.

","To all the critics out there who tirelessly condemn everything to prove their own frightfully sophisticated sensibilities, I offer this:<br/><br/>""You, LIGHTEN UP!""<br/><br/>I saw this movie this evening. I laughed. I was amused by the bright, shiny, golden images of an idealized ancient Egypt. I marveled at the speed and ballet-like precision of the battles between our yin/yang princesses. Vosloo is a kick. Oden is an honor-driven delight to watch. (Sure, the annoying parasite brother really should be fed to scarabs, but we can always hold out hope for the inevitable sequel, yes?) Weiss has crafted a character that is actually interesting (something which eluded her in the Mummy.) Fraser is a joy to watch (I still can't decide which is my favorite Fraser performance: Gods and Monsters or George of the Junglehmmm.)<br/><br/>I enjoyed the over-the-top camp style, and yes, I found many of the CGI effects to be amusingwhich does not mean that I did not find many of the CGI effects gratuitous, overblown and unbelievable. Plot? Something about a second apocalypse and scorpions. Who cares? The movie is gorgeous, its stars engaging, the tone light, the action dazzling and the obvious purpose is to entertain.<br/><br/>I had a great time at this film. Why? Because I allowed myself to sit back and take the daring mental stand to enjoy itfor what it is. It ain't high art, folks. Don't condemn it for not being something it isn't. It never presumes to be, yet reading through the undeservedly scathing reviews I'm reading online, so many are disappointed that it has not reinvented filmmaking. It is a big, blowsy, overblown summer action flick. Is it perfect, the best movie I've ever seen? No, by no means. Did I get my $8 out of it? Absolutely. Is there too much reliance on CGI? You betcha. Should we, the audience, DEMAND substance to go with our high-tech advances? Absolutely. All the bells and whistles are no substitute for a great script. The Mummy Returns was an amusing summer confection, something you enjoy and then you move on to more substantial fare. I certainly cannot deny that this could have been a great movie had they paid equal attention to story that they did to CGI...<br/><br/>The fact that the studio powers-that-be see fit to bestow a star-vehicle on Johnson for the next is a sad testament to the power of the studios to mindlessly whore themselves to the celebrity-du-jour. It sickens me the amount of press our pal the Rock has received for his 8.2 second, pecs-a-ripplin' appearance. Sure, the man is charismatic, he looks buff and manly in a leopard loincloth, but blink and you miss him.  And frankly, the minions of Anubis were more realistic CGI characters than our bad guy in the end. Please. A giant badly animated demonic lobster. Ooooh,  SCARY! From what I've read, Johnson is an intelligent, savvy, hard-working, well-spoken man. I've no real complaint with him as a person, a celebrity or even, as an emerging action star. For what it is worth, I enjoyed his brief (non-CGI) contribution to the film. But give credit where credit is due.<br/><br/>
My biggest gripe has more to do with marketing that with the film itself: Brendan Fraser has been robbed.<br/><br/>This is unquestionably, HIS movie, and yet, he is forced to share his well-earned spotlight with a bit player. Fraser is a gifted, talented and charismatic working actor whose contributions to his projects are consistently rich. He and the other members of the cast deserve a great deal of credit for bringing us such a fun summer diversion. His ability to graciously accept second banana status to the Rock speaks volumes of his character.<br/><br/>So, I suppose that what this all boils down to is this: ramp down your cynicism, and go see this movie. See it for what it is, and you'll probably enjoy the ride. I did."

I found the heavy reliance on digital special effects, a staple now in Hollywood, to detract from the heart and spirit of the original picture, which used them liberally as well (but not nearly as much as here). The characters were the same, but they did not seem to be having the same feel to the them as they did in the first movie. The film's nature was darker as well, not as tongue-in-cheek as the first picture. The reason I liked the Mummy so much was its blend of high-octane action, great stuntwork, good special effects, and a light touch of comedy. Here everything is CGI special effects in overdrive, much in the same vein as the Jurassic Park films. Also, the darker nature of the film made it seem less interesting than the first one did.

If you know anything at all about ancient Egypt (4 canopic jars, not 5!) check it at the door or watch the History Channel. If the pharoahs would have had 1 ounce of the powers in The Mummy/Mummy Returns, do you think they would have been conquered  by the Hittites and Romans?<br/><br/>On the minus side, I missed Beni. Where did all those waterfalls come from in the oasis? The ballon sequence was a bit too long and more unbelievable than the rest of the film. It didn't matter one way or another how long the Rock was in it, I'm not a wrestling fan. Evies fate was pretty predictable also. Sometimes the CGI was a little fuzzy (same with Star Wars, Episode I) Oh, and the idiot who sat behind us, who felt the need to repeat every line, just in case we missed it the first time.<br/><br/>Plus side? Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez) did exactly what I thought she would. She did a lot of gestures, grimaces, etc., in the course of the film indicating she wasn't exactly a stand by your man kind of girl. Oded Fehr and John Hannah where back. Arnold Vasloo, still a great bad guy. Freddie Boath had a wonderful quality of being intelligent and adventuresome, without losing the fact that he was still a kid. And can that kid build sand castles? And as my teenage daughter would say ""Brendon Fraser, what's not to like?"".<br/><br/>All in all, it wasn't all that bad.

","I hate people who don't like movies that have one goal: to entertain.  Some movies aren't made to be awe inspiring.  Some movies aren't made to be classics.  Some movies are made for the simple purpose of being fun.  The Mummy was one of these.  It was a fun, funny, and cool movie.  Anyone who didn't like 1999's The Mummy is not human.  Now we have the sequel.  It is entertaining, but no where near as good as the original.<br/><br/>Seeing this movie made me appreciate the first movie.  The first Mummy was an adventure movie, through and through.  In the tradition of Indiana Jones, the movie took us to another world, made us laugh, built suspense, and was really cool.  The sequel is nothing like this.  In the first movie, we don't see the mummy Ie-Moh-Tep until almost an hour into the movie.  It used the ""Jaws"" technique of not showing the monster until the audience becomes annoyed at its absense.  The Mummy Returns goes ahead and shows us the Mummy in its first 30 minutes.  Is this bad?  Not really.  Its just different.<br/><br/>Next, the major difference between the two movies is the pace.  The Mummy was relaxed, not moving slow, but not overdoing itself.  It kept running at a brisk pace.  Now The Mummy Returns is fast.  Very fast.  Jet speed fast. The movie does not waist time in character development (because they did that in the first movie and if you're seeing this movie you've seen the original).  The Mummy 2 runs from one action scene to another.  I found that after the first hour I was getting real tired of it.  Too much of a good thing, after all.<br/><br/>The movie's biggest problem is the thing the first movie did so well: its special effects.  The Mummy Returns has some of the poorest excuses for CGI special effects I have ever seen.  Okay, maybe not.  But this is ILM folks. The people who invented modern day movie special effects starting with the fisrt Star Wars movies and moving on to Terminator 2, to Jurassic Park, and the upcoming Pearl Harbor.  These guys are the best in the business.  So why are the effects so bad?  Because ILM's schedule is packed, and something had to be cut.  Think about it.  ILM is doing Jurassic Park 3, Pearl Harbor, A.I., Star Wars Episode II, Planet of the Apes, The Mummy Returns, and other movies all at the same time.  Some movie had to get shafted.  Well, this is it.  Some of the effects in this movie are great.  Any effect involving a face in some thing like a wall of water of smoke (like the wall of sand in the original) is great.  The ending battle scene is done good.  Some other scenes are great.  But there are plenty of other BAD special effects shots to make up for it.  Overall the movie just looks fake and this impacts the overall effect the film has.  Movies like this need to be fun and somewhat believable.  If the effects suck, well, so does the movie.<br/><br/>I have one last major gripe.  I can beleive that people can be brought back from the dead.  Yea, I can.  It's part of the movie.  It's the whole point of the movie.  If you can't suspend that belief than just stop reading this and go rent Gone With the Wind.  But I cannot suspend the belief that a hot air balloon has after-burners.  There is this scene where the movie's main vehical, a hot air balloon, is being chased by the wall of water with Ie-moh-tep's face (a-la the Mummy 1).  Well, to escape, the pilot (if you can call a guy who flies a hot air balloon a pilot) hits a button and, vu-al-la, these rockets egnite and the ballon escapes in a burst of speed. The rockets are the main propulsion device on this balloon, that belief I can suspend for the sake of entertainment.  But AFTERBURNERS!?  HAHAHAH! That's laughable!<br/><br/>In conclusion:  This is an entertaining movie, but a bad movie.  the plot is very, very, very, very, very weak.  The characters and the actors are pretty weak.  Even the damn special effects are weak.  But, hey, it is kindof fun. Go see it with the kids, they'll get a kick out of it.  But trust me, this is a movie you see once, talk about once, then forget.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10"

","Overall, I was quite pleased with the movie and found it to be quite entertaining, although the ending left something to be desired.<br/><br/>Like many other viewers, one reason I went to see the movie was because the Rock (aka Dwayne Johnson) starred in it (well, actually, it may be considered a supporting role).  Because of the commercials, I was lead to believe that the Rock would have a major role in the movie (the character, the Scorpion King, had a major role, not the Rock himself).  As a result, I was mislead but not disappointed.<br/><br/>Although the Rock did not have a major role in the movie, I found it to be thrilling, humourous and action-packed.  All in all, it was the best movie I had seen in a while.  In fact, in some cases, this movie was far superior than the first.  Not only that, but the movie contained much of the continuity of the first and featured many of the same actors as well.<br/><br/>Also, if you haven't seen the movie yet, watch the previous movie first. This will re-familiarize you with the characters, their motivations, evil creatures, magical artifacts, certain locales in Egypt, etc.  This will prevent you from having to remember who a certain character was.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo and Freddie Boath all performed quite well (from an entertainment point of view), and I would be extremely interested to see them all in another Mummy sequel (it can be done, because after all, we're talking about Hollywood here).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie was not perfect.  The ending was disappointing.  I will not describe it, but what I found disappointing was the use of poor computer animated graphics rather than a live action shot.<br/><br/>Because of the ending, I only gave it 9 out of 10 stars."

","I saw The Mummy, and enjoyed it somewhat, and when I needed something to watch tonight I settled on the sequel.  I don't recall the original well enough to compare them very closely, but I can say that I did enjoy the sequel.  Not all that terribly much, but I would recommend it.<br/><br/>For about the first hour, the film is a wonderful action comedy.  The characters, dialogue, and action were all working for me.  Then at about the halfway mark things start slowing down in the film, and when the action picks up at the end for a conclusion (That features no less than 3 simulatneous battles going on at any one time), it feels anti-climactic, hardly exciting, and ripe with action film cliches.<br/><br/>Some of the stuff, like the interaction between the characters of the film first (I especially liked Jonathan, once more a worthless but humorous sidekick) works very nicely.  Others, like the good portion of screen time spent on a bizarre dirigible, including a chase scene that mirrors one from the original film, don't.  Most of the best stuff comes early in the film, and I found by the end I was losing interest.<br/><br/>Part of the problem could be that the film is really exciting from the start, and practically doesn't let up for the first hour.  After that, I was sufficiently thrilled, I almost didn't need more, so when the conclusion came, I didn't have any energy left to invest in it.<br/><br/>Those who are going to see The Rock in this film, be warned.  He appears for only about 5 minutes in the film.  I don't quite understand how he got so much money and billing for a part that seemed like a cameo to me.  Imhotep, the Mummy from the first film, returns (Hence the title) but is pretty underused.  <br/><br/>I would marginally recommend the film, especially to fans of the first, but I would not go in expecting anything more than a summer action film that presents a lot of special effects, perhaps too many for its own good."
"#1 Gracie","7","0","0","11 May 2001"," Returning With Better Effects But Mediocre Story
","I just ""returned"" (ha ha) from the movies this evening from seeing ""The Mummy Returns"". And while I loved it, I was also a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>The story begins with a narrator explaining the legend of the Scorpion King (The Rock), and in turn begins with a magnificent battle scene. After the legend, we are taken to the current time where Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) are touring the tomb in which Evie finds the mystical bracelet of the Scorpion King. However, a group of bad guys and a reincarnated version of Im-Ho-Tep's (Arnold Vosloo) mistress Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Valezquaz) are also after that very bracelet to use in their plot to bring back Im-Ho-Tep, raise the Scorpion King's powerful armies from the dead, and take over the world (bwa ha ha!-kidding). They succeed in stealing the safe in which the bracelet was kept, but are foiled when they discover the bracelet isn't there, on account of it being on the wrist of Evie and Rick's kid, Alex (Freddie Boath). So they steal the kid, leading Rick and Evie into another wild adventure dealing with ancient curses and evil mummies in order to save both their son and the world from destruction.<br/><br/>This movie was spell bounding cinematically. Beautiful and breath-taking special effects in almost all of the scenes! You saw some of The Matrix effects used in some of the fight scenes. And the sound effects have certainly improved from the last film. It was amazing to watch.<br/><br/>But it stumbled upon one problem, and that problem can be best explained by one of my mottos for movies: a movie can't live on special effects alone. Between the action/fight sequences...well, the story was weak. It never really interested or impressed me whenever there was no effects. Now, I'm not one of those people that need lots of awesome effects to keep me entertained. It's just that the screenplay/story needed more work when it couldn't rely on movie magic to help it survive.<br/><br/>The acting was okay. I thought Rachel Weisz was somewhat weak in her performance. Brendan Fraser did an alright job, as did pretty much all of the actors. The one I really liked though was whoever played Izzy, Rick's assistant. Any no-effects scene he was in was instantly wonderful. He deserved a bigger role, and I think they should make a movie out of Rick and Izzy's pre-Mummy adventures. I'd pay to see that!<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was fun summer entertainment. While weak in some areas, I thought it was very fun to watch and a good way to spend a Friday night in the summer. I give it a 7/10"
"damndirtyape182","10","0","0","11 May 2001"," Praise the heavens, FUN movies are back
","Warning, these comments will contain spoilers.<br/><br/>I must start by mentioning that when first seeing THE MUMMY I was underwhelmed, however after purchasing the film as one of my first DVD's something inexplicable happened, I had fun, for some reason everything just clicked in my brain and the cheezy plot and sometimes ropey CGI became one of the most enjoyable experiences that I had ever seen. Since that moment although I have enjoyed a number of films including CROUCHING TIGER & TRAFFIC, I can only claim a few being as fun as THE MUMMY such as GALAXY QUEST & now THE MUMMY RETURNS. I couldn't comment on this film without first responding to critisisms to the break-neck pace which the film travels. I have always believed that action films should only rest when introducing characters who should then be developed within the action sequences, this sequel takes the logical step of assuming prior knowlege of the first film so doesn't waste time making us get to know them all over again. Not only does this give a good reason to start the film with a bang, but also provides some truly inspired ways of developing characters such as the flashback sequences with particular mention to the alternate version of the opening sequence from the first film.<br/><br/>But the one thing that a film like this needs is action and effects and the film more than succeeds in both catergories, I know a lot of mention has been made about the final battle with the Anubis warriors and this was nothing short of stunning, on par with the final battle would have to be the bus sequence which returns the extremely cool soldier mummies from the first film and creates one of the most exhilerating vehicle sequences ever, the highlight for me was the 1/2 mummy fighting Ardeth Bay. I also enjoyed the reworking of the face on the wall of sand sequence and found that for some reason it worked even better this time (probably because it wasn't over-hyped on the preview). Special mention also goes to the pygmie mummies which was an idea I never thought would work but was handled brilliantly with just the right level of surprise and action while also managing to never take itself seriously.<br/><br/>The special effects all manage to impress from the subtle work done creating the small scorpian at the start of the film to the incredible creation of the oasis immediatly afterwards. The mummies all looked fantastic with a noticeable improvement made with Imhotep.<br/><br/>However the effects I was most waiting for were the Anubis army and the Scorpian King, and while the Anubis army was amazing I felt that the Scorpian King's initial shots were less than impressive, however after about 6 seconds something happened, it starting running around taking chunks out of pillars and knocking over scenery, this is where the CGI suceeded in my opinion as the the amount of interaction with the surroundings was incredible for all the CGI creations and helped me suspend disbelief for the entire film.<br/><br/>I had no problem with the Rock's limited screentime because it was all the film needed, it's worth noting that Anuck-sa-na-mun had very little overall screentime in the first film but has still developed into an extremely interesting character.<br/><br/>Other elements that worked extremely well included the use of Jokes with direct reference to the first film and the great new score by Alan Sivestri which would rate as one of his best.<br/><br/>I would give the film a 10 for delivering the fun film I wanted to see without disappointment (a rare event indeed).<br/><br/>The short story is, go and see this film. Forget about things like realism and spotting elements from other films and just try to do something that is becoming increasingly hard to do with films... ...Enjoy yourself"
"Steven Reynolds","Null","0","0","11 May 2001"," Spielberg should sue
","Might be entertaining for a younger generation, but anyone familiar with the ""Raiders"" trilogy will find this film derivative to the point of absurdity. The tongue-in-cheek Spielberg homage of the first film here collapses into outright plagiarism, plundering everything from car chases to shot setups, and almost all of Act 3.  The whole thing feels hastily written and produced, with a nice story idea too hastily shunted aside to make way for special effects that are surprisingly below par  all no doubt driven by an obsessive desire to get this film to market before the euphoria induced by its predecessor wears off.  Good business logic, but the result is a crap film.  So don't waste your time.  Stay home and watch the Raiders trilogy instead.  It's all be done before, and done better."
"HBeachBabe","6","0","0","11 May 2001"," Not as good or as funny as the 1st
","A classic case of sequelitis.  Take those aspects of the last picture that everyone liked, multiply by 10, cut character development to make room and viola, instant sequel.<br/><br/>I will admit to not liking Mummy the first time I saw it either.  I was expecting a horror film and instead got a cut-rate Indiana Jones adventure-comedy.  But after watching it again on DVD I developed an enjoyment of the film for what it was- a fun, light-hearted adventure romp with excellent special effects, witty humor, and engaging (if undeveloped) characters.  I even was looking forward to the sequel.<br/><br/>Maybe it will take another viewing of this one as well, because on first viewing I found Mummy Returns to lack the fun of the first one. The humor is carried mostly by Rick & Evie's son Alex and Evie's brother Jonothan.  While they have some good lines, they don't measure up to Kevin J. O'Connor's Benny of the first film in terms of comic relief.<br/><br/>The film is composed primarily of action scenes that simply lead into one another, many without much purpose other than to show off digital effects- Where did those pygmy mummies come from? and who controlled them?- and others simply a direct lift from the first film - Im-Ho-Tep blows a wall (this time of water instead of sand) at our airborne heroes, complete with his face which again ""eats"" the airship.<br/><br/>The hand-to-hand fights were well staged as were nearly all the action sequences (although we have seen the double deck bus into a bridge gag before in a James Bond movie).  The only special effect I was disappointed with was the final Scorpion King.  Why was a digital version of the Rock's face used instead of his real head?<br/><br/>Im-ho-tep himself is sadly under used, his place being taken by a couple of forgettable lackeys and the reincarnation of Anck-Su-Namun, along with the ever present threat of the return of the Scorpion King hanging over their heads.<br/><br/>An entertaining, if somewhat jumbled & unfocused summer diversion, but don't expect too much.  Just as Mummy was a primer for Phantom Menace, Mummy Returns is just keeping theater seats warm until Pearl Harbor is released."

"Darth_Stat","Null","0","0","11 May 2001"," A sumptuous feast in the truest sense of the word.
","Like a Toy Story 2 complex, more of everything, they reference the original and a million other movies in no small way, through Terminator 2, to The Lost World, and an ending that borrows heavily from Star Wars Episode I. Everyone knows they got the energy from Indiana Jones for both movies but this one doesn't really rip off any particular part of the series. The acting is great, there is no woodenness or badly spoken lines, and every character gets a claim to fame. The biggest problem is that there is so much luscious digital that it leaves a pretty cartoony feel, I think perhaps they did go overboard with that effects work.<br/><br/>The story is comprehensive and relentless, it just keeps on moving. They had to take the characters to the next level or it would not have been enough. In the words of Liam Neeson ""it's probably a bit too much to take in in one sitting, that's why you have to see it two and three times"" he said that of Episode I, which I disagree with, EI was pretty cut and dried after one sitting but this twists and turns with maximum content all through.<br/><br/>Basically the beginning leaves you dying for more and more. The Scorpion King and his army after many a battle, ending in a failed war campaign is exiled and as the sole survivor he makes a pact with the Coyote God Anubis, dirt simple, his soul in exchange for not dying of thirst. A bit of a Spawn type of arrangement. The god accepts and he leads the Army of Anubis Warriors and after all is conquered him and his army are put on the back burner for 3, 000 or so years.<br/><br/>The exact details of how he and his army are raised and what determines when are a little hard to follow but basically, a week after Rick and Evelyn open the chest containing his bracelet he and his army will be out and about. Now theres a bad guy who wouldn't mind having the army lead against the world but the only problem is, in order to control the army you have to kill the Scorpion King, thats where Imhotep Aka, The Mummy (Arnold Vosloo) comes into it. Imhotep resurrected is the only being who could ever do so (or is he). So fossilised in an amber like substance (from the original) he gets shipped to London along with the baddy and his enterage in pursuit of the Oconnels who split with the Scorpion Kings bracelet. After a hell of a chase sequence from four mummies, courtusy of a resurrcted Imhotep the action heads back to Egypt for a million more fight scenes and chase sequences, mummies, mini-mummies, armed guards and thier Seti Bodyguard Descendant from the original who gets a much larger and cool part.<br/><br/>To get a clear overview of this movie you have to see it more than once, which is not to say there isn't plenty to warrant doing so. This movie is rich with all the summer blockbuster goods and a record breaking weekend gross to prove it. It made nearly 70 million winter dollars by then but has only moved just past 80 since. I wish it all the best, this a worthy sequel to The Mummy and may just succeed where it failed, I would like to see it lop Hannibal off within another 5 weeks, a not unrealistic possibility, see this one, you'll definitely get your moneys worth."

","I went into this movie thinking I would only see it for the really cool action content, only to discover that there really wasn't any (none that was interesting for more than 10 seconds anyway). Damn near all of the acting is wretched, the plot is practically see-through, the lines are 100% trite, and the graphics are like that of a first-generation Tekken fighting game. Seriously, it was much better in the beginning when The Rock was acting rather than the ending when he's a cheesy, full-scale computer simulation. This is another in a series of movies in which Brendan Fraser tries to appear as the witty and likeable protagonist, but he's still downright annoying.  Child-actor Freddie Boathe has about as much appeal as the red-headed kid next door who likes to torture insects. Weirdly, the only redemptive features of this movie are the two main mildly-interesting villains, played by Arnold Vosloo and Patricia Velazquez. In short, don't let the trailer fool you."

","I liked the new direction they took Evie, making her more like a<br/><br/>Cameron woman: tough. Very different from how she began in the<br/><br/>first film, but it still works. I like strong women in film. I hate the<br/><br/>""Help me, James,"" you so often get in Bond movies. So seeing<br/><br/>Rachel come out as this tough broad willing to risk her neck and<br/><br/>not afraid to get down and dirty with the boys in order to save her<br/><br/>family was very cool. <br/><br/>Rick's a bit older, and more cautious. He's got a family now and<br/><br/>doesn't want anything to happen to them. His best moments are<br/><br/>when Evie or his son, Alex, are in danger. <br/><br/>Speaking of Alex, the kid (Freddie Boath, I think) who plays him is<br/><br/>really good. A fine addition to the cast. <br/><br/>The rest of the returning cast is fine as well, especially Oded. He<br/><br/>gets beat up pretty good, but he's got some great scenes.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, the film is strong. <br/><br/>It's the effects that really mar the film. You can tell the movie was<br/><br/>rushed into theaters, unfortunately. They really should have<br/><br/>pushed this back till November. The old Mummy effects and<br/><br/>assorted returning tricks from the original look fine, but a great<br/><br/>many of the new stuff looks bad. The hot air balloon, in particular,<br/><br/>looks fake in almost every shot. And the final CG for the Scorpion<br/><br/>King, not too give too much away, is almost laughable. It really<br/><br/>looks silly. I've heard complaints that Anubis's dog warriors looked<br/><br/>fake, but hey, they're dog warriors - how real did you expect them to<br/><br/>look? They're fine. They get the job done. <br/><br/>There's also much less humor this time. The film is darker. The<br/><br/>gross factor has been pushed up a bit. What humor there is<br/><br/>depends a great deal on having seen the first film. <br/><br/>What works, though, are the personal relationships of the<br/><br/>characters. I really bought into Rick and Evie's relationship, and<br/><br/>that these people care for each other, and were willing to die for<br/><br/>one another. There is a very interesting juxtaposition of their<br/><br/>relationship and the one between Imhotep and Anck-Su-Anum,<br/><br/>culminating in a final moment for all four. The way each reacts to<br/><br/>their corresponding counterpart in that one moment is the real<br/><br/>resolution of the film, despite anything else that may occur after it.<br/><br/>
As for the action, everything has been turned up a notch. While the<br/><br/>first had a fairly long passage in the middle with only one short<br/><br/>action sequence (on the boat), this film races from one action<br/><br/>sequence to another. It never really stops to take its breath. Some<br/><br/>may say this is a bad thing, but it never loses sight of the principal<br/><br/>characters along the way, and the action is strong. <br/><br/>The threat is also more real this time, culminating in the death of<br/><br/>one of the returning leads, rather than a side character like Beni<br/><br/>from the first film. It's a shock that works for its immediacy and<br/><br/>potency. <br/><br/>Like its predecessor, the film is driven not by the men, but by<br/><br/>women (and, in this case, children). It is Evie and Anck-Su-Anum<br/><br/>who propel the story forward, along with young Alex, and who force<br/><br/>things to their eventual conclusion. Even The Mummy himself<br/><br/>almost takes a back seat on the ride, as the O'Connells are forced<br/><br/>to deal with myriad bad guys. But he pops up every once in a while<br/><br/>to muss their hair and make up. To see an action film driven not by<br/><br/>men but by women is a rarity, and even more rare is one that<br/><br/>works for a male audience. But this one does. <br/><br/>All in all, the film is a fine sequel. I missed the humor of the<br/><br/>original, and the effects should have been given more time, but the<br/><br/>action is good, and the characterization is strong. This isn't just a<br/><br/>remake of the original. They took the story in a new direction and<br/><br/>turned things up a notch. The core of the film is the O'Connell<br/><br/>family. If you buy into them and their relationship, and care for them<br/><br/>as they care for one another, then you'll live with the occasional<br/><br/>awful CG and won't bemoan the lack of humor too much. If not,<br/><br/>then it's going to be a very long film."

Evie<br/><br/>is an important reincarnated Egyptian character from the past and<br/><br/>Rick is the hero who discovers himself (he realizes his origins<br/><br/>near the movie's end) -- this is stuff Joseph Campbell would talk<br/><br/>about.  To see them riding that hydrogen balloon-boat was<br/><br/>reminiscent of the solar boat that Ra sails in on his daily journey<br/><br/>across Egypt (i.e. the Sun's daily journey).  The technology used to<br/><br/>represent this image was highly appropriate, in my opinion.  For<br/><br/>the characters, they are like gods out to do justice and good<br/><br/>against the sea of corruption and evil (which Anubis, Imhotep,<br/><br/>Scorpion King and Anck-Su-Namun represented).<br/><br/>While the CG is not as great as the first movie, there was new stuff<br/><br/>tried out which doesn't quite work.  The vast armies of Anubis<br/><br/>warriors and Magi soldiers were fine, but the cg work on the most<br/><br/>basic of tricks (i.e. the oasis jungle as it is being sucked up) just<br/><br/>didn't work for me.  It looked too crisp.  Perhaps if the spfx people<br/><br/>used traditional special effects methods, the resulting shots would<br/><br/>have looked better.  Also, the Rock's final appearance would have<br/><br/>been better if he was actually there for filming instead of a cg<br/><br/>rendered version of him."

","WARNING!!! Could contain what you may consider spoilers. Depends on how you look at it.<br/><br/>I liked the first one, and really didn't expect too much out of this one. I mean let's face it, Hollywood kills movies with sequels. Where to start on this one. <br/><br/>I will say this much, the action is good, but sometimes over done. Computer enhancing is often times used in movies today, I mean let's face it, almost all movies. But in this one it is so obvious some of the enhanced images.<br/><br/>Then you have the whole Rock, Dwayne Johnson role in the movie. The movie has been built up to appeal to wrestling fans, boasting of The Rock being in the movie. My being a wrestling fan played into my going to see this. But what does he really do in this movie? He's in the first scene and has one line, three words in the Egyptian language. Then he's sort of in the last scene, by sorta I mean his face is enhanced on the body of a scorpion.<br/><br/>And this tatoo thing with the main character, played by Brendan Fraser. All of the sudden, after a previous movie, Ardeth Bay (the protector from the first movie who helps Fraser) notices a tatoo by Fraser's wrist that means he's a magi and protector of the world. Fraser claims to have gotten the tatoo in an orphanage at a young age, so where was this tatoo in the first movie.<br/><br/>On top of this, no orginal actions scenes. They are all ripped off of many movies, such as Bond, and even the first Mummy movie. Not to mention the popular Hollywood trend of ripping of Matrix in fight scenes. Oh yeah, that reminds me, since when did Evie become so bad? In the first one the last thing she knows how to do is fight, and in this won you would think she was one Charlies Angel's.<br/><br/>In closing, I hated it. The only enjoyable aspect was the Alex, the son of Fraser. He made for some good laughs."

That sense is missing from the sequel, where the filmmakers seem to think we will take it seriously if the world is threatened with apocalypse in 1933 (I suspect that if the world had been overrun by Annubis warriors in 1933 I would have read about it in my history books).<br/><br/>   What I also find odd is that several scenes that were featured prominently in a ""The making of"" special on AMC were noticibly absent from the final film.

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** 30 Second Bottom Line: A mummified warrior returns to face his nemesis and reclaim his lost love. Entombed for nearly 2,500 years, since his last respite in The Mummy, he and his lady love search for the key to The Scorpion King, who has the power they need to control the world. A team of heroes, keeping it all in the family, a la Spy Kids, is determined to keep world order from being taken over by an evil army.<br/><br/>Story Line: The movie begins in 3,067 BC with The Scorpion King (Dwayne Johnson, a.k.a. wrestler The Rock) as a battlefield officer. He's been through seven years of fighting, and is the only warrior left alive. He begs to live and agrees to abandon his soul to Anubis; first, so he will not die of thirst in the desert, and then to lead fearsome armies into victorious battles. The Scorpion King's wishes are granted and after resting in his tomb for 5,000 years, he and his sworn enemy Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo) are called upon to fight once again. This time the mission is not just to win local military campaigns, but to take over the world and advance the cause of evil.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the Egyptian desert, circa 1930's, Rick and Evelyn O'Connell (Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) are archaeologists with a precocious eight-year-old son named Alex (Freddie Boath). During their dig, they unwittingly set events into motion to free The Scorpion King. Meanwhile, on the other side of the oasis, the reincarnated Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velasquez) and her band of bandits releases her mummified lover, Imhotep. These two, let loose on the world, would make Hitler look like the tooth fairy.<br/><br/>Evelyn has visions of her past life, when she was Nerfertiti and fought her adversary, Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velasquez). In one illusion she sees a sealed vault, and the combination to unlock it is revealed to her. Inside Evelyn, Rick and Alex discover hidden treasures. One item is a chest with the gold bracelet of The Scorpion King, which locks on Alex's wrist when he picks it up. Removed from its resting place, the bracelet will resurrect The Scorpion King in seven days. It's back to the London Museum with the artifacts!<br/><br/>The thicket of thieves chasing them, led by the gauzy bad guy Imhotep, includes the splendidly robed Lock Nah (Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje). They want the bracelet themselves to harness the power of the Scorpion King for their evil pursuits.<br/><br/>This cast of characters, along with Evelyn's brother Jonathan (John Hannah) and Rick's old pilot friend Izzie (Shaun Parkes), take us on a trip of unparalleled action and adventure.<br/><br/>Tell Me More About It: The Mummy Returns starts off in what seems like a rehash of other big budget action films (this one came in at $100 million), aimed at young boys. There are big battle scenes with legions of ferocious dog soldiers, captures and escapes. Hand to hand combat, where enemies look each other in the eye. Furtive and dusty agents of Imhotep scurry along the sides of buildings and pounce on their prey. Combined with a fair amount of tongue in cheek humor, Indiana Jones style, this adds up to a fun ride.<br/><br/>
About the time you think the movie is just OK and simply going through the motions, it kicks into high gear and makes you sit up and pay attention. Creative writing and special effects accompany non-stop action. There are imaginative scenes, like floating in an out of the ordinary hot air balloon, sailing across the path of the moon, reminiscent of ET. The creativity intensifies to the point of being almost as mind blowing as when we were introduced to the final battle scenes in the first Star Wars movie over 25 years ago.<br/><br/>The story makes just enough sense to hold your interest and the supporting actors are often as good as the stars. The demographic appeal of this film may be unmatched. Weisz and Velasquez do battle in a female rendition of Gladiator, with a touch of the style of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Freddie Boath is a refreshing new talent for the bubble gum set. The Rock's wrestling fans will not be disappointed with his bigger than life action. The Latino and African-American supporting roles by Agbaje, Parkes and Velasquez are each strong and intelligent, whether on the side of good or evil. It's refreshingly non-stereotypical. With Weisz and Hannah keeping their accents from England and Scotland, they'll give this film an added boost in the European market. After that, throw in Arnold Vosloo from Pretoria in South Africa and another continent has a marketing angle.<br/><br/>
Heck, while Brendan Fraser is no Russell Crowe, when you compare The Mummy Returns to Gladiator, using the logic of the Academy Awards, this could be the best picture of 2001. I'm just kidding, but who knows, it could happen."

","What a movie! I didn't especially like the first one all that well, but I thought what the heck, I'll give this one a chance. It's not that I didn't like the first one, it's just that it was only a mediocre movie. This is worse. After seeing this one, I'm sure not looking forward to ""The Scorpion King"" at all! I was hopeful during the first half hour of this movie because it wasn't that bad; I was actually kind of enjoying it. But, after a while I got really sick of the special effects and towards the end I was bored! Yes, I was BORED! This movie has WAY too many special effects. And they really aren't that impressive. Also, too many idiotic fight scenes! The sound of clanging metal drove my head crazy by the end of the movie. This movie wasn't extremely long, but it sure seemed like it! The plot (what little of it there was) got so ridiculous that towards the end I didn't care anymore, I just wanted to get it over with. Action is great when you stop and take a break from it every now and then, but when that's all a movie is, you just want to stop to breathe. Even James Bond takes a break for a drink every now and then (shaken, not stirred)! Also, WHAT was up with the Rock being in the movie less than 10 minutes?? He gets top-billing along with Fraser, yet he's hardly in the movie! They got me interested in his character at the beginning and that's all the screen time he got. (Well, he returned later on...kind of.) This movie also lacked any frightening scenes. The only thing frightening about this movie is the possibility that ""The Scorpion King"" may not be the last ""Mummy"" movie (especially since ""MR"" was record-breaking at the box office). And I will close with an excellent (and hilarious) point by Ebert: A man cannot outrun the sun (easily). If you don't know what I'm talking about, I urge you to see his review."

","I was skeptical of The Mummy Returns, thinking the trailers were just showing us the good stuff which would come too few and far between like Driven, but this film delivers outstanding action.  It never gets boring, such as its predecessor The Mummy.  That film tended to drag and the mummy isn't shown until a quarter into the movie.  But this film keeps the action moving and doesn't abandon its characters.  Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz generate great chemistry and the screenplay develops them so well.  I love the way they connect with their son, Alex.  They care for him and play that convincingly, therefor, we care.<br/><br/>Some critics say the film is boring because it has TOO MUCH action.  I disagree.  That's what makes this film great, plus it has an interesting plot.  The mummy is resurrected by the reincarnation of his former love, An-nack-su-namun, to battle the Scorpion King, whose 5000 years of slumber is about to end, in order to take control of his army, Anubis warriors.  The main characters have to stop the mummy and kill the Scorpion King in order to send the army back to the sand from wence they came and also save their son who wears the Bracelet of Anubis which the mummy needs to guide him the Am Sheer, the resting place of the scorpion king.<br/><br/>I got that from the first viewing and I didn't know what this movie was about.  With all its characters and complicated plot, one would think this movie would turn into a mess right before our very eyes, but it doesn't. The plot was rich enough to carry on for two and a half hours.

","As neither a lover nor hater to movies, but rather a neutral movie reviewer I feel I can give a fair and summarised review of The Mummy Returns.<br/><br/>First of all The Mummy Returns is no bad movie at all, in fact for a sequel it is rather good for this particular genre which has a track record for bad or below average sequels.<br/><br/>Writer / Director Stephen Sommers could have taken some things into account when making this movie, for example . in The Mummy, we observed a growing relationship between Rick and Evie which gave us a view of how deep their characters were portrayed on-screen.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns however loses some of that depth and instead focuses more action based scripting and observation.<br/><br/>There is some depth though but for all those who have not yet seen the movie, I will not give anything away.<br/><br/>Graphically The Mummy Returns certainly delivers all the action you would expect Industrial Light & Magic to perform, proving that they are yet again the victors of special effects and digital animation.<br/><br/>One area that brings movies like this to life is the musical score and Alan Silvestri does a great job of entertaining us in more ways that one.<br/><br/>When I first heard that musical maestro Jerry Goldsmith was not going to score the movie, and instead Alan Silvestri was taking charge I felt somewhat displeased by the decision. However with movies such as The Abyss behind him, who was I to judge him unfairly?<br/><br/>If you listen closely you will hear elements of other past movies in his composure, which works perfectly fine with this type of movie and all-in-all proves as a great musical piece.<br/><br/>If you have seen The Mummy then I recommend this excellent sequel, however if you have not seen its predecessor then Sommers has done a very amicable job to ensure The Mummy Returns is as appealing to non-fans as it is to the hardcore fans of the 1999 original.<br/><br/>Possibly the most action orientated movie for the next few summer months and a worthy trip to the theatres plus your entry fee.<br/><br/>As with its predecessor The Mummy Returns does indeed kick off the summer movie season and with definite style too.<br/><br/>It is no Academy Award winner by any means, don't get me wrong there, but it is a top-class action adventure flick that we all can enjoy non-the-less.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns: 7/10<br/><br/>The Mummy (1999): 7/10"

The plot also tries to be too in depth and detailed while the movie should just have a simple kids movie plot.

Does anyone else have a problem with the fact that the mummy warriors were able to burst through a brick wall, but were affected by Rick's punches?<br/><br/>

To be sure the graphics were quite realistic, but in the way they were used it was so over the top and outlandish that the 'specialness' (if that is a word) of the effect was lost.<br/><br/>The original had a bit more of a quality story for what is at the most basic level a B-line movie.  The Mummy Returns was full of too many characters: The brother-in-law and the child were of no use and did nothing to advance the plot.  The Scorpion King was a thin plot device to use two evil characters instead of one bad guy. It is a sequel and therefore must have more baddies.<br/><br/>Special effects were best put to use in the panorama/CGI images of ancient Egypt, the large battle scenes and in the visionary use of the Scorpion bracelet.  Otherwise, the closeups of CGI monsters, The half-scorpion/half-Rock creature at the end, the pygmy mummies, the dirigible/boat combo were altogether uninspiring.<br/><br/>Overall I have to give it a 6.

And there was also the part with them running down a narrow hallway ahead of a torrent of rushing water.<br/><br/>I could be wrong, but anyone who has ever played the computer game Diablo 2, by Blizzard Entertainment will swear that the little blowgun pygmy creatures, the creatures in the dark army, and the Rock-Scorpion king all have very obvious counter-parts in the game.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed how the producers were able to get around The Rock's utter lack of acting talent by casting him in a role that does not require him to act.  Gotta love it.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is not one that will go down as one of the great movies in history.  But it's extremely entertaining, and would be an excellent movie to watch with a group of friends.  I highly recommend it to anyone."

","I thought the movie was excellent!! To me it was better than the first one. It had the same cast to it which made  that very  good. The suspense, I would rate it excellent. The action- excellent, humor- good. Overall summary ""excellent"". I would nominate this for an award. I would rate this with 4 stars (****)."

","I'll start by saying I liked the movie. No, it wasn't as good as the first. I wouldn't even say the effects were as good as the first (which I rewatched the night before on DVD). The cool ""face effect"" is back. More than once. Not done quite as well, either. While I thought the idea of what happens to the Scorpion King was good, the effect used to pull it off doesn't quite make it. Too many characters, not enough plot. If you like One-liners, you'll have something to look forward to.<br/><br/>So, why did I like the movie with all this going against it? The action never stops. The movie hits the ground running and keeps going. Yes, the final rescue is more than a little silly, but the ""Yes it is!"" line (nearly) makes up for it. It's not a great movie, and it knows it. It IS a fun movie, and it does that well.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a movie like War And Peace, why the heck did you go see a movie called ""The Mummy Returns"" ? Go watch What Planet Are You From? instead. The rest of us will enjoy the sequel."

","There is an actual science to the right way to make a sequel.  The two best examples would be ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Superman II""<br/><br/>I would say ""The Godfather II"" but that film is half prequel. When a sequel is made, it is imperitive to not put on a rehash of the original.  It must be bigger and larger.  It must have better effects and it must break new ground in the story as for as character development and plot movement.  This film seems to accomplish most of these standard requirements.<br/><br/>
Well it's eight years later.  Rick and Evie are still creeping around in those forbidden tombs, and now they share these misadventures with their prodigenic son Alex.  Their exploits take them further beyond the city of the dead into many different locations, and as fate would have it ,they are not out of harms way.  Within the first ten minutes they are ambushed by grave-robbing thugs and knee-deep in booby traps. If this sounds like the same thing over again, it's true, just with a whole lot more.  In addition to thugs, the undead, scarubs and Prince Im-Ho-Tep himself, Rick, Eve and little Alex must also deal with a new Egyption armata lead by the deadly swordsman Lock-Na, the skitish and grusome little pygmys and the army of Anubis led by The Scorpin King, played by WWF sensation ""The Rock"".  Again ,the crack staff at Industrial Light and Magic do what they do best ,generating the Army of Anubis and just about everything else in this film that doesn't have lines.  One of my personal favorite scenes has a pygmy pay tribute to Dr. Strangelove.  Score one for the sequel.<br/><br/>The whole cast is back.  Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Oded Fehr, Arnold Vosloo and Patricia Velazquez.  Score two<br/><br/>""The Mummy Returns"" is even more crammed with action sequences then the original, unfortunatly it means that there is a little less time for comic relief and romance.  The pacing is much faster and not for the sunday driver.  Half a point score there.<br/><br/>The locations are not limited to just one area.  The group of adventures span a good chunk of Eygpt that include the oasis of the golden pyrimid. The broader scope sets up the stage for the climactic battle between the Army of Anubis and Magi.  Big score here<br/><br/>There is not very much character development here.  One of the adventages of a sequel is that all the importent characters have already been established. The draw-back in this film is that there is no exposition for subbordinte characters.  The currator, the female archeologist, the Red-vailed army, the three thugs, Rick's pilot friend and even Ardeth Bay's messenger bird get not exposition.  The Scorpion King gets all the exposition that he needs, but that's all he gets.  I'm sure that WWF fans are non too happy with The Rock only getting ten minutes of air-time in the beginning and five minutes in the end.  What is worse is that his closing scenes are of a poorly made CGI version of him as a half scorpion monster villan.  The film doesn't even explain why or how he turned into the beast that he is.  It would have been a better move to keep him at his wrestler body for the final fight. Minus two points here.<br/><br/>The characters of Rick and Evie have their characters given more exploration, with a couple of prophacies.  This approch seems to work for Evie but not so much for Rick.        Restore one point.<br/><br/>As metioned before ,the climax of this film involves a maylay between The Army of Anubis vs. Ardeth Bay's boys in black.  It is awesome. The end also includes the much anticipated three-way fight to the finish between Rick ,Im-Ho-Tep and The Scorpion King.  This fight is a bit of a let down, because it's not what it promised to be.  One out of a possible two points.<br/><br/>The other fight scenes in the film are good, like the Princess duel and the duel between Ardeth and Lock-Na and the prelude fight of Rick vs. Im-Ho-Tep is better then the original.<br/><br/>To sum up, in spite of all it's flaws ,this film is a good sequel and a good summer/popcorn pleaser. As for the WWF fans, you'll be able to smell what The Rock is cookin when repraises his role in the prequel."

","I just don't understand it. Just about every sequel ends up like this; torn apart by a bad script and pasted together again with special effects. Don't get me wrong- I like special effects...in moderation, but lately I have been disappointed in the lack of real-time camera in film. Producers are using computer graphics instead of on site filming, giving film a bitter, artificial taste.<br/><br/>The script also suffered. Like in most modern films, the film lacked personal interaction. More and more fight scenes are used; the script-writers seem to have replaced drama with violence and computer graphics. The plot drags on, with the expected twists that offer little mystery or audience involvement. This review probably could fit other sequel characteristics- if you know of any just send me an email."

","There would be spoilers in this review if they weren't so predictable.<br/><br/>This movie started out promising enough - dark mystery of the Scorpion king - some not-too-terribly-recycled scarab beetle attacks, intriguing hallucinations.  I was in.  I was ready for a good movie - and the first half hour or so delivered.  Some semi-enjoyable this is what would happen if this were a silly movie references entered... still moving in an acceptable direction.  They jumped on a double decker bus - fairly cliche - I wondered when the top deck would get removed on a low bridge from the moment I saw it.  Still pretty acceptably entertaining up to that point.<br/><br/>Then.... it happened... The movie became unimaginably bad.  Every character - every scene borrowed from some other movie - and providing the transportation - some sort of balloon-equipped wooden ship from the pages of Baron Von Munchausen complete with the worst blue-screens effects I've seen in years.  Top it off with the ultra-dissapointing reappearance of the 'scorpion king' as the 'oh no, we've run out of money, let's use claymation' special effect and you've got yourself one of the most disappointing movies ever.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

","Okay, the story of ""The Mummy"" was stupid, and the story of ""The Mummy returns"" is no more than a lame excuse for another movie. But, thank God, the movie is completely aware of its silliness, and thanks to that (and therefore full credit to writer/director Stephen Sommers), the second part is exactly as great as the first one. The dialogue is still witty, self-ironic and very funny (sometimes even more so than the first time), tongue-in-cheek allusions to a whole bunch of other movies (from Titanic to Alien and back) will leave you howling for more, and except for a small step on the break in the middle (with 123 mins., the movie's a bit too long), it's rollercoaster par excellence. Bonus point: The sometimes crappy visual f/x of part one is first rate this time.

The computer effects are at times breathtaking and at times silly, but always entertaining, just like the movie itself.  Acting is almost nonexistent, and the few serious moments are done tongue-in-cheek and are purposefully hilarious.  Just try not to laugh whenever Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz kiss, or any time The Rock makes an appearance.  Director Stephen Sommers and cast have made the perfect summer movie - not for one second does it take itself seriously.

","If you like to see state-of-the-art 21st-century special effects injected into a farcical plot with poorly written dialogue, then The Mummy Returns might be just the movie for you.  The special effects saved this movie from a disaster worse than the one the characters in the film face.  As in the first installment of The Mummy back in 1999, The Mummy Returns packs a punch with a lot of exciting special effects.  However, that is where the similarity ends.  Whereas The Mummy had some semblance of a plot, the plot of The Mummy Returns is used like a clothesline to display the special effects.  The entire concept is far-fetched: ""We didn't learn our lesson last time when we unleashed the most dangerous mummy of all-time.  Why don't we unleash one that is even more dangerous that we conveniently forgot to mention in the first movie?""  In addition, we see characters appearing, going places, and doing things that have no logical explanation for them. As bad as the plot was, it looked like Shakespeare compared to the dialogue, which appears to have been written by a 7-year old watching Saturday morning cartoons.   A sample: ""I really hate mummies.""  Wow, what insight into the character's mind!  This movie would make excellent fodder for a future Mystery Science Theater 3000 show. Here's my recommendation: if you want to see a lot of amazing special effects with little else, go see The Mummy Returns.  If you want to laugh at a completely incomprehensible plot and crude dialogue, go see The Mummy Returns.  This movie is a 3 at best."

"emilyblunt","Null","0","0","3 May 2001"," This ain't your mommy's Mummy movie!
","The Mummy Returns relentlessly spews special effects at you like a double barrel assault weapon right from the start. The special effects are almost overwhelming as they ricochet across the screen. At the end of it all you're almost physically dizzy from the continual flurry of clever, if not 'been there, done that"" style, of computer generated mummies, goblins, bugs and fight scenes. Scenes that always began with the Hollywood- Raider's- of- the- Lost- Ark- action-movie-music, triumphant yet foreboding, blasting through the Dolby system. <br/><br/>It seemed as if they were trying desperately to recreate the magic the 1st Mummy / Brendan Fraser smash hit had with this bombardment of effects and music. Perhaps they thought by confusing us with lots of visual treats we wouldn't notice the gaping plot holes. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. TMR deserves three stars for it's special effects movie-making techniques alone. The action is great, the scenery is great, the story, in theory, is great. But the (predominantly) returning cast is just blasÃ©, delivering corny jokes and boring dialog. Otherwise, it would have been perfect! <br/><br/>Even the extremely evil Imhotep, played by silky smooth Arnold Vasloo, seemed all mellowed out and less hell-bent on evil deeding and mayhem than in The Mummy one. Vasloo's Immie needs a strong shot of attitude as with his first encounter with the meddling Rick O'Connell (Brendan Frasor) and his treasure seeking band of misfits. <br/><br/>But, who's looking for Oscar material here? It's Action Flick 101 with sexy actors, actresses and a cute kid thrown in. And, as stupid as TMR gets at times, it's worth it's weight in Egyptian artifacts of pure gold!<br/><br/>Then there's what I call it's Sinbad Effect (The storybook sailor, not the comedian). Those wonderfully campy, velveeta cheesy characters just too fake to believe. Even with the state of the art computer gizmos of our era attempting to make it all look real, it doesn't work. Which makes it all the more endearing. The best example is the Scorpion King himself with his colossal Sindbad-esque, 1/2 man 1/2 scorpion body, that willl have the slightest of arachnaphobes sweating profusely in their theater seats. Shudder. <br/><br/>The Mummy Returns story goes... The O'Connells, an archaeologist (Rachel Weitz) and ex-bandit (Brendan -steaming hot- Frasor) , who met in the last movie, have bred. They now include an adorable, precociuos 8 year old son, named Alex (Fred Boath). <br/><br/>The happy family is excavating at a site, in deepest Egypt, thought to hold the long deceased Scorpion King's golden bracelet, which in turn commands the underworld Army of Anubis. <br/><br/>The bracelet is extremely gaudy, in a WWF accessory looking way, but, he who possesses the trinket can call uon these minions and overtake the world. Armageddon.<br/><br/>Why not just let it be? Stay buried in it's sandy grave for the next 5000 years? Ah, well, Mrs. Evi O' Connell has been obsessed, suddenly, with finding it. She's been riddled in her dreams. Fed vivid images of a past life and an insider's knowledge of the evil bracelet's hiding place.<br/><br/>Now, the O'Connells are quite awake and just centimeters from that hiding place.<br/><br/>Just down the road, in the Valley of the Dead, we find shady characters unearthing everyone's favorite evil priest, Imhotep from his grave (Well, from an Alien prop the producers got at cost at the Universal auction, at least!). <br/><br/>Hollywood, never ones to let popular characters go, has managed to resurrect the menacing half-fleshed- twice dead-already-original- movie-mummy, Mr. Imhotep (sexy, smoky, South African Arnold Vasloo). He appears, as do many familiar returning characters, as we weave and scurry like a wounded scorpion ourselves toward the entangled plot.<br/><br/>Imhotep is greeted by another old cast member, Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez). She is his soulmate mistress and his Pharaoh's murderous wife. Ankie has been reincarnated to serve him. <br/><br/>Immie whines immediately. Seems she's Anck-Su-Namun Aramalamadingdong in body, but not in soul, and he will pull her soul from hell so their love can once again rule the world....Isn't it romantic?<br/><br/>Of course, Imhotep needs that Scorpion King's bracelet to lead him to The Scorpion King's Golden Pyramid, and awaken / rule the Army of Darkness, oops, I mean Army of Anubis! <br/><br/>So, off he, and his merry band of cutthroat followers, go. They head straight to the O'Connell's, who just happen to have returned to London with the infamous bracelet, and, even though they've been pretty much in this very scene before, are dumbfounded as to what it all means.<br/><br/>Their young son Alex, playing arround in the antiquities, accidentally gets the bracelet stuck on his arm. The bracelet wastes no time in showing it's magical powers to the lad. It begins by pointing out various Egyptian landmarks like some beyond- the-grave holographic viewmaster.<br/><br/>Whoops! The child and his golden trinket have been grabbed by Mrs. Imhotep and the assisting bad guys! The chase is on!<br/><br/>Their old, holy friend, Ardeth Bay (Oded - handsome in a manly, swarthy way - Fehr), joins in the pursuit, and we travel from ruin to ruin with the O'Connell clan always one step behind the kidnappers and Imhotep's world domination!<br/><br/>We are never explained why we have to make this bizarre multi-ruin excursion across Egypt. First to Karnac then to Hamunaptra. For some reason the Scorpion's all-telling bracelet will only show one stop at a time. Can you say plot stretching? Who cares, it's fun!<br/><br/>Did I forget to mention the young O'Connell, Alex, has been informed by the helpful Imhotep that the pretty gold bracelet on his arm plans on sucking the life out of his little body if he doesn't get into the SK's Golden Pyramid by sun up on the 7th day? <br/><br/>Ultimately, both parties, nearly simultanously, arrive at the Oasis of Pygmies upon the 6th day at dusk. <br/><br/>Here they find the illusive Scorpion King's Golden Pyramid. Ah, but getting throught the Oasis isn't going to be so easy. There's these creepy pygmy guards that attack in a bloody frenzy to deal with first!<br/><br/>Tension's on... <br/><br/>Will Alex make it into the pyramid by sun up? Can the O'Connells stop Imhotep and the army of darkness, er, Anubis from overtaking the Earth? Is the Scorpion King even in this? Will Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun settle in a small westside pyramid for two and have a little mummy of their own? And, most importantly, Will Brendan Fraser keep aging this beautifully?<br/><br/>Some of TMR's scenes actually had me laughing out loud - not where the screenwriter had planned, I'm sure! For one, the evil Scorpion King's army, resurrected from the grave, looked like rabid greyhounds. Even at seven feet tall they looked high-strung and wimpy. Reminiscent of the silly feminine storm troopers in Star Wars Episode One. Just hysterical!<br/><br/>And those horrid little Muppet-esque ""guards"" of the Scorpion King's Golden Pyramid - the pygmies. They were just stoopid! It's not humiliating enough to this would-be world dominator, The Scorpion King, that he's half arachnid, but he's got to have these bazillion evil Muppets guarding his tomb? I bet he's got ""Imhotep Evil Army"" envy! <br/><br/>TMR is what it is. One of those great summer movies filled with a swashbuckling leading man, a sassy gal pal, a precocious offspring and a barrage of really mean bad guys that you can cheer on as they are inevitably crushed in brilliantly, if redundant, choreographed fight scenes by our heroes.<br/><br/>Just be ready, there are so many leading characters and such a deeply woven storyline, intermingled with fancy Egyptian words, that, at times, you'll be lead so far off the camel trail, you may forget why you had to stop in Hamunaptra or Karnac enroute to the Pigmy Oasis.<br/><br/>This ain't your mommy's Mummy movie! It's nice to sit back and be transported to a world of make believe once in a while. The Mummy Returns did just that. This is not a serious FILM; it is a movie and a darned good one at that. Walk like an Egyptian and go see it. Yah-la!"
"insult2injury","4","0","0","6 May 2001"," Would make a good computer game **SPOILERS**
","WARNING - SERIOUS SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>If you're looking for (somewhat) fast-paced action, and (almost) incredible computer graphics, then The Mummy Returns is for you!  If you're looking for things like dialogue, character development or story lines, this might not be your movie.<br/><br/>I mentioned that this might make a good video game, because half the time that's what I felt like I was watching, culminating with the CHEESY monster at the end.  They couldn't even superimpose The Rock's real face somehow, they had to computer animate him, and the results are cartoonish and laughable.  The other half of the time, I felt like I was watching a new stunt show at Universal Studios (not a bad idea, eh, Universal?  Just make sure I get credit...).<br/><br/>I have to say, the character of Imotepp was much more interesting as a computer-generated, half-rotted mummy than he is later when gets his skin back.  I had a problem with him mysteriously (and conveniently) losing his powers just before the big fight.  What we had been waiting for the whole movie, a battle between two legendary warriors, turns out to be pretty lame.<br/><br/>I had other problems with the script, such as the strange scene where the kid (Alex) gets kidnapped off the bus.  Alex goes to the back of the bus because his parents are kissing (again), and then... nothing.  Nothing happens for a good two or three seconds.  Alex just kind of stands there, looking around and then, finally someone grabs him.  It looks like someone forgot their cue, and the poor kid had to improvise.  Not to mention the writers' excuse to get Alex away from his parents, is because right after a deadly battle with the undead, they like to make out.<br/><br/>And why, oh why, did they even bother to tell us that Rick MIGHT be a Magi? Even when he realized it was true, what good did that do?  That may have been the lamest plot point of all time.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you liked The Mummy, you may like this one.  Something tells me that in the original Mummy series from the 30's, that Boris Karloff's sequels were probably just as dumb."

Which can still be entertaining to view, but...<br/><br/>And for those who say, ""it's an action movie, turn your brain off and let it flow over you"", that's not an excuse, many similar movies (Indiana Jones and the original MUMMY) are better thought out.<br/><br/>The saving grace of the movie are the charismatic stars.   They're likeable even when the script doesn't give them much to do but run around.<br/><br/>I could be Comic Book Guy from THE SIMPSONS and detail about 101 things wrong with this movie (and that's not hyperbole), but it's still a fun ride while you're watching it.   But you better turn your brain off while viewing it AND afterwords, because otherwise, more and more things will bug you about it.<br/><br/>The fact that I feel the urge to compile that list of 101 things I think shows that the movie had the potential to be great, but didn't achieve it.<br/><br/>

","As with all sequels to Films you love, your expectations have to be kept low, so the disappointment is equally low or the elation is extremely high. And I loved the first one. Not since Raiders has there been a film that is as exciting, romantic and as action packed as The Mummy. So the sequel? Well it wasn't disappointing, which is good, but it wasn't the equal of its forerunner either. I just didn't leave the cinema with the same skip in my step and big grin on my face. All the ingredients were there, with some superb action sequences - topped by the Pygmy sequence - but it just didn't mix. It wasn't Alex, the son, once you got used to him you realised he had some of the best lines and it wasn't The Rock (thankfully his appearance is very short lived). It was just a lot of action and fighting sequences strung together by an overfilled and often incomprehensible plot - it's called Mummy Returns, which he did, but from there on had little to do. It seemed to forget that the last film mocked the cheesiness of old cliffhangers and just became cheesy itself, with some awful clangers in the script which should have been delivered with tongue firmly in cheek. In it's credit, the stars were still hugely likeable, Brendan Fraser clearly carrying the Indiana Jones' (metaphorical) hat into the new millennium, and the set pieces looked spectacular. I think it needs a second viewing as a lot of the one liners were lost under the sound effects and I'll still going to buy the inevitable Collector's Edition DVD (with behind the scenes and meet the stars), but tonight I'll be sitting down in front of the original and reminding myself of how it could have been"

Yes you know the body is going to be CG but so was his face!! It looked so fake, I almost thought I was playing a video game with all the CG stuff! Besides that if you liked the first Mummy movie, you will most likely like this one. It isn't as good mainly because it uses a lot of the same effects and story lines.

Who cares, right?  It doesn't matter that the film lacks substance, because we are just going to see the special effects anyway!<br/><br/>So let's talk about the special effects.<br/><br/>Well, they stink, frankly.  The FINAL FANTASY reject lobster referred to as the Scorpion King is really quite pathetic.  But no, wait, we are also treated to these little Pygmy-mummies that move at a dizzyingly fast speed, a speed that prevents us from really focusing on them.  After a while, I honestly had to look away--the creations are so terribly rendered, I just couldn't take it.  Wait!  One more, I must.  In the middle, an evil mummy summons the Nile to rise up and chase after our heroes in their dirgible. Cool idea, but the ""water effect"" is laughable.<br/><br/>If those three examples aren't enough, rest assured that there are a hundred others where they came from.  I just don't have time or space to mention them all.<br/><br/>Dammit, if there are 100 million or so dollars spent on effects, I sure as hell would like to see that money on-screen.  Otherwise, save the money!<br/><br/>My friends tell me that I'm too critical.  ""You've gotta leave your brain at the door, sit back and just watch it.""  And so I did.  I've ""forgotten"" that the dialogue is terrible and the pace is a mess. I've ""forgotten"" it all.<br/><br/>If this is a movie about special effects...well the special effects are arguably the worst part.  So there.<br/><br/>I really want studios to reexamine their priorities in effects films.  This whole CG overkill that has come about with TITANIC and THE PHANTOM MENACE and GLADIATOR has gotten way out of hand.  It's NOT REAL!  And it's NOT EVEN BELIEVABLE!  Bring back ANIMATRONICS!  Bring back some form of suspension of disbelief to the cinema.  CG is just not the same.  Make me, if only for a second, believe that I'm watching ancient armies collide in the desert. Make me try to believe that there is a giant Man-Scorpion standing in front of me.  Please pretend that there is some form of intelligence in the audience.  I'm not saying to get rid of CG (it's a great and sometimes necessary invention), but just remember, when you're filming those giant battles: nothing beats the real thing.<br/><br/>Oh well, that's a whole other story.<br/><br/>But it's really the least they should have done with this 100 million dollar goose egg."

","The plot of this sequel picks up where its predecessor left off, with most of the cast from the previous film intact.  The plot itself is pretty interesting and well done, which is fairly unusual for a big sequel like this.  Unfortunately, the film spends most of its time on overdone action sequences.  When I say overdone, I'm talking about the fact that there is tons of CGI and martial arts style fighting, and everyone knows that you sacrifice quality for quantity.  What we're left with is a bunch of endless scenes where no take is over 2 seconds long in order to disguise the poor quality CGI and fighting skills of the actors.  It gives you a headache after a while.  However, most of the CGI where they actually give you time to look at it is beautiful and quite creative (with the exception of the final action scene, which is pretty pitiful).

","The Mummy Returns is a very successful sequel because it is able to utilize the familiarity of the first Mummy without going over certain elements of it over and over again and making them tired.  The action is amped up, the special effects are great, and the expansion and elaboration on the themes of the first movie really tie them together and makes this one enjoyable. Rachel Weisz's character Evie in particular has evolved and is more sure of herself and sexy.  Her fight scenes are beautiful and particularly exciting. The addition of Alex, the son of Evie and Rick, actually flows well and adds a new dimension to the film, despite my fears that he would be disruptive to the dynamic established between the characters from the first film.  The Mummy Returns allows you to see your favorite characters from the first film in a new situation with new elements thrown at them and between them, making it enjoyable and not just a retrodding of the first film."

But then again so did the first Mummy.

","I usually don't leave comments for films that will generate dozens upon dozens of reviews, as mine will get lost in the mix.  The further it descends down the list of reviews the less likely it will be read.  However, in this case I had to leave a review because I hope that anyone who happens to read it will take heed and save themselves the price of a movie ticket.<br/><br/>I was not all that impressed with the first movie, although my wife and kids love it and the more I see it the more I like it.  I was actually looking forward to seeing this sequel.  To say it let me down would be misleading. The more appropriate way to describe it would be to say that the film hurled my hopes to the ground and proceeded to stomp on them all the while laughing at me for the amount of money it cost to see this film with my family.  As from many of the other reviews you can tell that this film did not have the character chemistry between the actors.  Although others seem not to like Fraser in this role I think he saved the movie.  His character seemed the least changed, other than the fact that he was always trying to initiate a romantic interlude with his wife (Weisz)  In fact if he had not been pursuing his wife of 9 years so aggressively he could have avoided most of the perils, if not all of them.  Still, Fraser's performance was almost as good as the first.  <br/><br/>The rest of the actors didn't do much to enhance their roles.  The Rock's performance was okay but after all the hype I expected to see a little more of him.  Not so!?!  Also, the special effects involving him sucked big time. If you don't mind learning the end before you see the movie read some of other reviews here at IMDB to get an understanding of how the movie fell apart. Instead of using the FX to enhance the movie it dominated the movie and despite what some say they were not that good.  The price for the large amount of FX was the small amount of coherent story.<br/><br/>The first movie had normal people thrust into unusually situations.  This film now takes these same normal people and changes them into people that have been reincarnated, while others, we find out, have been marked as protectors of the world against ancient Egyptian folklore.  Figures that the writers can't identify what was good about the first film.  It makes me wonder if there is a writer strike in the motion picture industry if the industry won't be better of for it.<br/><br/>Like most action films this should be seen in a theater.  In this film's case it should be seen at the dollar show and not the 8-dollar show. Remember, it's your money and you've been warned."

Everything that is supposed to be a surprise can be seen coming too far off. I hate to ruin a movie for anybody, but trust me, you will know a major piece of how the movie will end in the first 30 minutes. It is practically waved under your nose. I think the people making this movie relied a little too heavily on our ability to suspend disbelief as well. Okay, I expect to have to just go along with several story devices in a movie like this, but don't push me too far. I can accept mummies that use martial arts (after all, I have to accept the whole Imhotep thing to even buy a ticket.) However, asking me to accept that a trip from London to Cairo only took two days in 1933 is too much.(Yes, I know that planes existed, but how do you transport the creature and his entire entourage so fast? It seems far more likely that trains and boats would be involved.) I am then asked to accept a rocket powered dirigible! And then this last device is stretched far beyond the breaking point.

The fight scenes are shown speeded up,slightly blurred and with in your face closeups. Kind of cartoonish. The sound is very loud and there were way too many special effects. No real story, just lots and lots of action. A bit like wrestling. My four year old loved it, which is probably somewhat the audience they were aiming for. I gave it a 6, I liked a lot of it. Just wish they had toned it down. I saw the first Mummy movie three times and bought both DVD's. Probably won't buy this one."

"keithanddeenie","5","0","0","8 May 2001"," Too much, already.
","""The Mummy Returns"" seems so intent on avoiding boredom that it goes in the other direction and simply crushes the viewer with action and detail.  I think the movie also operates on the premise that the audience is stupid. Almost all of the important scenes to come are set up by someone opening with ""It is written ... "" so that we know how the heroes are going to slip the noose even before the danger presents itself.  At least the writers saw how overdone the dialogue was getting and gave John Hannah the line, ""Where is it written?""  But I think the movie is too long and that it could have benefitted from rewriting and editing more than from cute cover-ups.  I am impressed by Arnold Vosloo, the South African actor who portrays Im-Ho-Tep. He has a strong screen presence.  I think that since the writers created an even more super-duper villain in the Scorpion King that Im-Ho-Tep might have evolved into a good guy at the end, as occurred in ""The Terminator"" series. That opportunity is even presented, but slavishly passed over in favor of an incredulous, three-way fight scene at the end.  This movie is hokey, littered with too much glitter and written by formula. It reminds me of those commercials where people ""stop trying"" but still expect to be paid. If anyone has to see this, at least wait until it comes on cable so you can tape it.  Then you can pause the tape for bathroom breaks.  Some of the external reviews were more entertaining than the movie itself."

","Quick and simple.<br/><br/>The Mummy 1999 - Bad scarab effects(and overused), bad acting (especially the female lead), annoying supporting acting, and a movie that was confused at times if it wanted to be serious or just fun.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns 2001 - Cameo use of scarabs (darker and higher quality work), the lead actress learned how to act between films, the supporting cast did a much better job, and the movie was just overall more fun than the first.  Oh yeah, the fight choreography was much better also.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the sequel had it's problems also (nobody has been able to properly CG a human face yet, but ILM gives a good shot at it here)<br/><br/>What makes the difference between the two films is that the first allowed its problems to detract from it's overall quality, while the second has problems that just add to the ""popcorn action film"" feel."

While this movie is enjoyable, it is no where near as good as the first one. First of all, The Mummy doesn't seem as powerful or as intimidating as he does in the first one.  Then they come up with all this stuff about Brendan Fraser being a warrior of god because he has a tattoo that he didn't have in the first one.  And now Rachel Weisz is the reincarnation of the Pharaoh's daughter and knows how to fight and can navigate pyramids, which she couldn't do in the first one.  The whole movie builds to the showdown with the Scorpion King who turns out to be a big cartoonish monster.<br/><br/>Still, this movie has good scenes.  The war scenes with Anubus' army, the sai fighting with Rachel Weisz and Patricia Velasquez, and the fight between Brendan Fraser and Arnold Vosloo.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first one, this is worth seeing in the theater because of the special effects."

","It would be impossible to describe all the reasons why this movie was terrible.  The one that sticks out in my mind is the way the movie treats its audiences like idiots.  Every single twist or turn or surprise in the movie was noticeable from a mile away.  Some things have been done so much in movies that after you see them a hundred times you expect it.  Which typifies what this movie is all about.  It is no thought and all visuals, some of which don't even look that good.  Specifically, something in the end scene which I will not mention.  The other way the movie embarrasses the audience is the way that every time the characters are in danger or in a tight spot there is some sort of illogical cop out to get them out of it. All the sudden there is a balloon that shouldn't be there, or a road conveniently placed for escape or stupid things of that nature.  I laughed a lot at this movie not when it was supposed to be funny but when it attempted to be serious, because it couldn't approach serious.  Don't see it, see a better sequal like Problem Child 2."
"TxMike","Null","2","5","13 January 2003"," Very formulaic adventure flick but one with enough action to hold your attention.
","I thought ""The Mummy"" was so bad I couldn't finish watching it. However, ""The Mummy Returns"" is a quite different and more exciting film that kept my attention all the way. Lots of action, and a very aggressive sound track with good use of the rear surround channels. The DVD picture is also uniformly good all the way.<br/><br/>I like Brendan Frasier and I like Rachel Weisz, and they seem very appropriate as parents with a young son. The story line was a bit hard to follow at times, with the mummy coming back and the Scorpion King coming back, but it involved an ancient bracelet that their son put on his arm, which protected him as long as he wore it, and all the bad guys trying to get it. The bracelet gave the boy visions of where to follow the get to a particular pyramid. As you would expect, the good guys prevailed in the end, after many chase scenes and sword fight and gun fights. <br/><br/>
OK film, easily forgettable, but with superb action and special effects. Another film greatly influenced by ""Indiana Jones"" films. Plus great to watch Rachel Weisz and Brendan Frasier."

"applejosh1991","6","1","2","23 April 2020"," a fun sequel, but the lackluster script hurts it's full potential
","First of all, this sequel for a period of time was very popular when it was released in spring 2001, being a box-office hit, spawned a couple of video games (there not that good), an animated series that lasted 2 seasons (suitable for children, no flesh eating bugs or PG-13 graphic violence) and started the movie career of wrestler-turned actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, and of course the prequel film ""The Scorpion King"" starring The Rock. this film was constantly on television for a long time, even more then the 1999 Mummy film. i saw this film when i was 11, i loved it back then, however one of the secondary villain's death scene gave me the heebie-jeebies and nightmares for years. i was only 11, i easily get nightmares at the time. now re-watching after a very long time, finally overcome this once disturbing death scene. still enjoy the film, but the flaws are much bigger then i remember.<br/><br/>almost the entire original cast and production crew are back, with Stephen Sommers returning to write and direct this film, but this time it feels like more of a studio demand film then a well-balanced sequel.<br/><br/>the plot takes place 9 years after the events of the first film, Rick and Evy are married and have an 8 year-old son named Alex, they became rich (probably from remaining treasures they found in the previous film, since they never bothered to even reference it), live in a big manner somewhere in Britain. but their adventure tomb-seeking habits never left them and all three O'Connell's went exploring ancient egyptian ruins, thanks to evy's visions they manged find the ""bracelet of Anubis"" as a valuable treasure at first, unaware it's a cursed item that can guide to the resting place of The Scorpion King and also a key to unleash god of the underworld Anubis' Jackal army. meanwhile evil worshiping cult leaded by Meela Nais a reincarnation of Imhotep's lover Anck Su namon who's being having similar visions to evy about her past and found Imhotep's corpse in the ruins of Hamunaptra. resurrecting him with the ""Book of the Dead"" to fulfill some kind of ancient prophecy on the year of the scorpion (on the year the film takes place) to kill the scorpion king and control his army for world domination. after the baddies failed to achieve the bracelet, they kidnapped Alex (due to his curiosity to put the bracelet on his wrist, unable to remove it) to use him to guide them to the secret resting place until they see fit to dispose him. Rick and Evy on their pursuit to find him with the help of Medjai Ardeth Bay, Evy's Brother Johnathan Carnahan and the pilot Izzy Buttons, to find their son and stop Imhotep from fulfilling his destiny.<br/><br/>like with the previous film, the sequel ""the mummy returns"" has great production values, time period setting, much larger action set-pieces and in times it does feel bigger in scope, the cinematography, fight choreography, stunt work, nailed the action, sense of adventure, ancient Egypt themes with egyptian mythology, culture and trying their best to add the dead language of ancient Egypt into the film the second time. some special effects looks fine other's very outdated (even back in 2001).<br/><br/>the protagonists: Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell is more developed this time, less of a jerk and more serious, cares about his family more likable then before, but the one who has changed the most was Rachel Weisz character Evy, from a book-worm to ass-kicking adventurer, she can hold her own, to the point that rick is almost a secondary character to her. their son Alex played by freddie boath who manged to avoid the annoying child character trope in this film, he's funny and likable, very smart 8 year old and comes off like a secondary comic relief, similar to John Hannah's character Johnathan Carnahan, who changed very little, but still funny and has few great moments. Oded Fehr as ardeth bay is fine, but sadly very underdeveloped when compare to the first film and his dialogue is 90% exposition dump. the villains: Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep is great as always, but sadly little underdeveloped, since Patricia VelÃ¡squez character Meela has more focus as villain then him. both Alun Armstrong and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje characters ""Hafez"" and ""Lock-Nah"" are excellent side villains, it's a shame they barley have any development.
and of course Dwayne Johnson as the other main villain The Scorpion King, who only appears twice, first in the prologue and in the final climax with infamously badly rendered motion capture CGI.<br/><br/>the late Jerry goldsmith was replaced with Alan Silvestri, who i think did an great job less majestic and more sense of high epic adventure music, considering the film is going for much bigger Indiana Jones vibe then the previous film. but lacks the sense of mystery and wonders that goldsmith provided.<br/><br/>so what's the problems? the script and some of the CGI. unlike the first film which had better pacing, focus and a point, the sequel's plot feels genuinely rushed, underdeveloped and moves from point A to Point B very quickly. the film has more going for the emotions and visual storytelling to it, but the dots don't really connect and it comes at the price of underdeveloped characters, motivations that makes zero sense and a lot of mythology and geography errors. they don't even bother to explain important plot details like who are the evil worshiping cult is or why imhotep doesn't want to take his revenge on the O'Connell's. there are couple of plot holes as well, but the one that bothered me even back then was on Evy and Meela being the reincarnations of their egyptian ancestors (that connect's to the fate of imhotep, when the pharaoh was killed) which causes their visions is very head-scratching and comes off as forced lazy storytelling to piece an already under-cooked script, it's such a shame because underneath this lazy script there's a very fun epic adventure film that could have been even better then the first film if they took their time working on a better script (since sommers wrote it). the CGI, for some reason sommers used this tool a lot since his film ""Deep Rising"", with the effect from ILM, but due to it's early age it can look super ugly on some things. CGI on imhotep is an improvement from the first film, some green screens look really good while others look very dated, but the scorpion king from the distance looks fine, thanks to clever lighting and other effects but from close-up it's really bad gives a very early 2000 video game CGI cut-scene vibe.<br/><br/>also i must address this, not only the script feels lazy and rushed but there's also blatant copying plot-points from the first film here, another opening prologue that takes place 3,000 or 5,000 years ago to introduce a villain who later get resurrected, some macguffin item that's both a key and a map, using flight transportation to the destination to rescue someone, imhotep using one of the elements with his face on it to stop protagonists flight transportation, another secret ancient temple in the middle of the desert that many people were looking for they never found it or never returned, a gold item/weapon to stop the main villain, imhotep loses his powers by the third-act and dies by giving himself to the underworld, the secondary villain gets killed by insects and ends with the protagonists escaping just in time from a collapsing temple with treasure in the end.<br/><br/>despite this issues, it's still enjoyable popcorn flick, just switch-off you're brain because the amount of plot-holes and suspension of disbelief is much higher then the first film."

Plus it's never a good idea to promote your movie around one star just to get butts to seats and sell tickets that is never a good idea. <br/><br/>Also the movie is graphic even for the rating it got, normally I try to avoid seeing that much in a film plus the acting in the film just feels out of wax I can't recall one good performance from anyone while it does have good actors I just don't think the acting is worth well nor is the plot of the film. <br/><br/>It just one of those films you'll enjoy or you won't and I didn't enjoy this one at all so much that could have been only to be disappointing<br/><br/>I give The Mummy Returns a 5 out of 10"

","The sequel to the granddaddy of all adventure films is truly mind-blowing, action packed, excellent, and a must-buy. It is ten times better than the original and that was the bomb. So if that was the bomb what would you call this? A WARHEAD packed with enough nuclear atoms to blow you out of your seat and all the way to Hollywood. The acting is even better than it's predecessor and it surely does contain more humor than the last along with better enemies. Stephen Sommers knew how to make one of the best sequels ever by including what the first film didn't have: Cooler and stronger enemies, more character development, better story, more adventure-themed style, and a great cast that has Brendan Fraser, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, and the beautiful Rachael Weisz. The new addition to the family is Rick's and Evelyn's son, Alex O'Connell (played by Freddie Boath). He is what every other boy wants to be. He is smart and witty, fearless, his personality is like any other boys but something about him makes people have a liking to him. The biggest surprise is the SCORPION KING played by Dwayne ""Rock"" Johnson but he is all animated and looks fake and he sure does make one of the best enemies in film history. This film is fun and original while it also maintains knowledge for the young ones.<br/><br/>After selling his soul to Anubis, Mathayus, a young warrior commands Anubis's whole fleet of soldiers and wrecks chaos. Thousands of years later, an artifact known as the Bracelet Of Anubis is discovered by the O'Connell's but what they don't know is that High Priest Imhotep has risen from the dead once again and is after the bracelet for it holds great power. The only problem that stops him from getting the Bracelet is Alex O'Connell, son of Rick, has attached the bracelet to his wrist and the only way to take it off is.... (a long story). If the Scorpion King is defeated, Priest Imhotep will be the new owner of Anubis's fleet and with that power he will make the world bow down to him. The O'Connell's and their friend Ardeth Bay have to fight once again through mummies, soldiers, weird stick creatures, in order to save their son and most importantly, save the world.<br/><br/>The action is tremendous and non-stop as the O'Connell's leave a trail of mummies behind them. The enemies play an important part in the film and it is really cool when they are being blown up to smithereens. The best enemies are probably the running mummies and the army of Anubis. People are complaining that the special effects are trash, and they maybe are, but that not the point of the movie. The effects are good but the story is even better. Who needs special effects when they have an excellent story? Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weisz, John Hannah, Oded Fehr, have good acting talents because they were made to play their roles. A few old enemies will make appearances in this film, like Imhotep, Anck-Su-Namun, and who could forget the lovely black beetles. The third film in the series is cr*p and should be avoided and you should instead watch Mummy Returns instead. (Spoiler!!!)The best scenes in the whole movie are the hot-air balloon being chased by water and the stick- men fight. Hilarious! Haters probably like complaining with everything and their comments should be discarded. If you guys haven't watched this, you must be living on mars because good movies hardly come out and the mummy is one of the good ones."
"fearfulofspiders","5","1","2","24 September 2008"," (REVIEW #100) The Special Effects Are This Film's True Handicap...
","If you fell in love with 1999's The Mummy, then there is sure to be some likable factor in The Mummy Returns. Everyone is back for a second adventure, and with a pretty good story, the film's only major handicap is its special effects.<br/><br/>The acting is hammier than the first, I must admit. Frasier is one-dimensional in this sequel, being that there is no real impact on his character that makes him any different from the first, or the beginning of this one; Weisz is misused as well. Even with the expansion of their characters (as being reincarnations) this only makes them subpar of two-dimensional. Oded Fehr's return allows more depth to his character, and he is probably the only one worth rooting for, as Arnold Vosloo is more convincing as a decaying mummy than he is in flesh. John Hannah's character, whom I left out of the first movie's review, is back, and is great as the comedy relief, but then again, even that title is limited, as The Mummy Returns delves more into comedy, rather than action.<br/><br/>Special effects allow for viewers to become entranced, and makes the story being told more believable. Yet, there is not one moment of realistic trickery, making this sequel worthy of a minus-three stars in total. The Scorpion King is so fake looking, as well as when Imhotep sucks the skin (or how ever he does it) makes the movie lose any grasp it once had on the viewer.<br/><br/>The music is disappointing, as there is nothing new or impressive about it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, as you could just listen to the first's and still get the same quality.<br/><br/>All in all, with bad acting and special effects to boot, this film is worth five-stars out of the possible ten. While providing escapism, the film loses to much believability to regain its seating as rousing fun. Instead, it's a disappointing adventure that I can only recommend to faithful fans."
"anifanmc","8","1","2","12 August 2008"," A well thought-out sequel
","The original Mummy was a good movie, and it's immediate sequel deserves no less commendation. The characters, plot, and feel of the movie leave you wishing for more at the end, and most of its flaws are minor and easily overlooked in light of the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>The story picks off where the first movie left, only about ten years later. Rick and Evie are married, they have a ten year old son, and they have a manor in England which they share with Evie's brother, Jonathan - but of course, their passion is still Egypt and they're off to explore more tombs with their slightly over-inquisitive son. In this case, Evie has been having visions of the past and it's led her to an ancient bracelet. Alex, being the annoying ten year old, puts on the bracelet and is promptly kidnapped along with Evie by a cult dedicated to the destruction of the Scorpion King, a mythical warlord. Of course, in their efforts, they've decided to resurrect Imhotep, the villain of the first film, and use him to kill the Scorpion King to take control of his army of Anubis warriors.<br/><br/>Rick and Evie are, of course, not about to let this happen, especially not at the expense of their son, and they go on a long journey across Egypt and Africa to recover him. They realize that Evie's visions are from a past life and that she was the daughter of the Pharoah Seti, Nefertiti, who was the sparring rival of Anck-su-namun, lover of the Pharoah, and also the witness to the murder of the Pharoah. With the help of Ardeth Bay, the Med'jai warrior from the first film, they discover that Rick is also a reborn Med'jai warrior destined to bring about the demise of the Scorpion King.<br/><br/>The film has some very high points. Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz are excellent actors and have a deep, almost explosive chemistry with each other, and with their on-screen son. Freddie Boath, as Alex, is hilarious, a great fusion of Rick and Evie, figuratively as well as literally. However the one character that I had my eye fixated on was Oded Fehr's Ardeth Bay. Not only is he the first Islamic warrior to be portrayed in a favorable light and leads the first full Islamic army since Lawrence of Arabia that is cast in a good light as well. He's the most emotional (and yet somewhat funny) character, and doesn't cling to the general stereotypes of an Arab that we tend to see in cinema nowadays. Jonathan is hilarious, and we get to see him showcase more than just his humor as he proves his worth in battle. And of course, Arnold Vosloo was fantastic as Imhotep, a villain to (almost) the very end and yet not a one-dimensional monster. His love affair with Anck-su-namun is more completely explored within the film and how it leads his actions is very obviously apparent.<br/><br/>Compared to the first film, though, it feels slightly less like it's designed for its time than the first film, which felt distinctly placeable in the 1920s like advertised. The film still feels stuck in that time instead of a decade later during the stirrings of the Second World War. The cult henchmen also felt a bit bloated and disproportionately stupid even for a film where the good guy is near invincible.<br/><br/>The references to the first film, far from coming off as cheesy, felt well placed and distinctly funny when it needed to be.<br/><br/>Truly a movie worth renting. 8/10"
"TOMNEL","4","1","2","31 July 2008"," Entertaining, but very, very messy.
","If you're thrilled by amusing one liners and nonstop special effects of all kinds of weird creatures, then you're sure to enjoy this second Mummy picture. If not, you will probably turn it off after a few minutes. The first Mummy picture was quite good, in that it managed to fit in characters and plot amongst the big budget special effects. The first picture showed that Universal movie monsters could easily be remade into big budget, special effect extravaganzas, and still be good. Everything I liked about the first movie (minus the characters) was overdone to the extreme here, and about halfway through or earlier, I found myself loathing this picture. The overall feeling though was not one of hatred...this is just an overplotted mess, with moderate entertainment value throughout.<br/><br/>Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is back, nine years after the first movie (I thought it was two, but whatever), and he and Evelyn (Racchel Weisz) are married and have an 8 year old kid, Alex (Freddie Boath). Imhotep's (Arnold Vosloo) mummy has been brought back to life, and he wants the bracelet of immortality, which is now in the hands of Rick and company. The bracelet controls the Scorpion King's (played in a pointless cameo by the Rock) army, which consists of easy to defeat dogs who with one hit turn to sand. Chaos ensues throughout.<br/><br/>If you aren't paying attention in this movie, or you miss the first ten minutes, you will be extremely confused. Heck, you could be paying attention the whole movie and still be confused. So much is going on, and so many special effects and new plot lines are shoved in your face way too often. Special effects on the mummies and creatures are pretty cool, but the bigger effects are just a huge headache, and they look very artificial. The plot is virtually nonexistent. I guess there are several plot lines, but in between them are many sidetracked scenes, and by the end, this just feels like a bunch of random scenes shoved together.<br/><br/>This movie is full of cutesy moments. I'm unsure as to why a mummy movie needs any cutesy moments, but since this is meant for families, writer and director Stephen Sommers made this both violent and cutesy and comedic, so it never fully works as anything (though it does work much better as an action movie than anything else). Jonathan (John Hannah) provides many of the movies cringe worthy lines. He's one of those characters that is scared to death from anything and everything, and still quips out the bad jokes. Brendan Fraser does the same, but he has a charm he brings to the character, and is one of the few positives of the movie. The kid Alex was a good addition, and for some reason, he felt more mature and developed than most other parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a pretty bad movie. It's full of effects that add up to nothing, and characters that do the same. There is some entertainment to be found, but you may find after you finish this, you'll be in desperate need for something intelligent.<br/><br/>My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 125 mins. PG-13 for violence."

","The Mummy Returns is the kind of movie where you can tell the actors from the first film really enjoyed that adventure to the point that they were willing to sign on immediately for this outing (which is nearly as good as the original film). While Brendan Fraser, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, and Oded Fehr do just as great as they did in the first film, they cannot match a superior performance by Rachel Weisz, whose character has really grown up in the 10 years since the original (she is now strong-willed and action packed, unlike her nervous youthful character in the first film). And while I miss Jerry Goldsmith's score from The Mummy, Alan Silvestri is definitely up for the task and produces just as good of a score. The only unmemorable parts include some cheesy CGI visual effects (look out for the palm trees at the end of the film as they swirl around the pyramid) as well as The Rock (another cheesy CGI construction). 7 out of 10."

But another force has also been set loose in the world... one born of the darkest rituals of ancient Egyptian mysticism, and even more powerful than Imhotep. When these two forces clash, the fate of the world will hang in the balance, sending the O'Connells on a desperate race to save the world from unspeakable evil, and rescue their son before it is too late...<br/><br/>This movie has extreme action in it. Gun fights, sword fights, even punch outs. This here is another worthy to add to your collection of classic films."

","The Mummy Returns is the sequel to the 1999 summer hit The Mummy. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraiser) is not fighting rebels in Egypt or getting into fights with people in bars. Instead he is quietly living in England with his wife, Every (Rachel Wiesz) and son Alex. Meanwhile a thousand miles away in Egypt, the body of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) is being prepared to be sent to London by his loyal followers. <br/><br/>Rick has no idea what kind of adventure he is going to be involved in and how much emotional pain it will cause when Imhotep begins his quest to kill the Scorpion King and conquer the world. There are many high points and many low points to this film. The development of Evey's character in a whole is fantastic and the fight scenes involving Fraiser and Vosloo are well-filmed and well-crafted. <br/><br/>The story isn't as scary as the first and the film is a bit more flashy. Fraiser reaches for his gun one to many times in the film but you'll still have a good.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns.

","Fairly enjoyable film, with good set pieces.<br/><br/>Enjoyed the film at cinema, it is only when you watch it at home that some details start to annoy you.<br/><br/>The computer graphics of the mummy and his guards were superb as usual, but the ending of the film was let down completely by the seriously ropey looking scorpion king at the end of the movie (didn't look anything like the Rock). What I have to ask is was the budget for cg spent on making the mummies look good, and they ran out of cash to polish the Scorpion King!<br/><br/>The MOST annoying thing about the whole movie though was the inclusion of the boy. Within two minutes of him on screen I was rooting for the bad guys when they were going to get rid of him!<br/><br/>I rated The Mummy as 10/10, and The Mummy Returns 8/10.

The ancient Egypt and pyramids never looked so vivid and great as in this ""motion picture"".<br/><br/>Story is simple and straight as a good tale and adventure should be. There are also some grotesque side stories (John Hannah really makes me laugh at times), the film seams to never get boring for me (I've seen it more then once, it even gets better when you see it a second time).<br/><br/>Sound soundtrack from Silvestry (a very adventure like one, his style seams to fit to this kind of films well, he scores another adventure film L.Croft Cradle of life recently with soundtrack very close to this one).<br/><br/>

","Now, admittedly, I adore Brendan Frasier, and think he can do no wrong. However, that said, I remember walking out of the theatre with a huge grin on my face.  I really enjoyed this movie.  This cast works exceedingly well together, and they didn't just rehash the same old jokes again.  The storyline's quite different, and the action scenes are, if anything, better. Yes, there are plotholes, particularly when you combine the two stories of the original movie and the sequel, and the immense commercial throughought the movie for the Scorpion King movie with the Rock was horrificaly bad. (At least that movie went down like a lead balloon.  Imagine, a wrestler trying to do an egyptian warrior.  Doesn't work for me.  Then again, I didn't see that one.  I wasn't interested.)  Even my sister, who does not like horror films, had fun with this one.  I do recommend it, especially to those who like the love story in the first one."
"Aaron1375","8","1","2","24 April 2003"," More action in this sequel, but the plot isn't as good.
","This one is very action packed this time around.  From start to finish is almost one action scene after another.  Unfortunately, it is not better than the first mummy because its plot leaves a bit to be desired.  First off, the mummy doesn't seem to be important enough in the plot.  The title of the movie is the mummy, but he doesn't seem to be the focus he should be.  Then there is the Scorpion King plot.  I don't mind that too much, but it just lessened the importance of the mummy further.  Thankfully, the Rock has no speaking lines and not much screen time to muck up the film.  Still aside from these and a few more story problems, this movie is a great action flick.  Best to just turn off your brain and enjoy all the action such as the cool bus chase in London or the forest filled with the little creatures. The effects, like in the first one, are pretty good...but nothing really ground breaking.  The Scorpion King at the end though was a pretty cool looking character that looked like one of Ray Harryhausen's stop motion creatures.  Looking for action though, then this is your movie."

From the opening sequence involving the Scorpion King, all the way to the final battle at the end (special effects a bit cheesy but fits the movie well), I was not disappointed.

Mindless rubbish it may be but we all need a break from reality now and again.  The sets, the costumes, the heroes and antiheroes were all larger than life and literally filled the entire cinema from the big screen.  Brendon was your classical 'sensitive on the inside, I adore my wife, rough round the edges slightly intellectual' hero... basically an oversized little adventurous boy in love... and the people loved him for it.  But, didn't we also sympathise with the mummy in the end also?...  Terrific twist... we didn't expect to show any positive emotions for that nasty number and the Scorpion King whose megalomanias made them hell bent on conquering everything and everyone... I loved the fact that we had 2 villains determined to turn each other to dust before having to deal with our 'cowboy', Rick.  But the real villain was the woman of the Mummy's veeeery long life... Rick's wife showed us one of the positive sides of a woman whereas the other one showed us what absolute bi...... women can be... {I'm a woman and what I said is God's honest truth}. We were cheering in our seats when she finally got what was inevitably coming to her.<br/><br/>Take a break from the everyday rat race, give your brain a rest and see this film on video or DVD if you haven't already seen it.

For Instance, the special effects may of been much more impressive than in the Mummy, but are specks of dust compared to movies such as The Matrix, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menance and others of that class. Another serious problem were some of the scene's were imitating the first movie. For instance, The Scene wear the Mummy cause the windstorm to bear his face and chase Rick O'Conner in the air plane, almost the exact smae thing happened when the Mummy caused a tidal wave to bear his face and chase O'Connel in a hot air balloon.

"schogger13","Null","1","2","7 December 2001"," Overkill from the drawing board - But fun
","One SERIOUS recommendation before you watch this one: Watch ""The Mummy"" first! From there on it's much easier to see TMR in the right spirit - or not at all. For those who loved the first one - depending on WHAT they loved about it - the sequel will range from utter disappointment to utter fun. For those who didn't like ""The Mummy"" at all, there can only be one rule: Stay away from the sequel at all cost... and also from this comment.<br/><br/>Right..., with that out of the way, we can go down to brass tactics. First: The sequel is no match for the original. ""The Mummy"" sported many of the virtues which made the 3 Indys adventure movie classics and can rightfully be called the best clone yet. The Indys are even more to be considered in so far as they are the only classic adventure movie series in existence which can boast a flawless line of equally good parts, one building on the other.<br/><br/>That's where TMR fall seriously short. I guess it fell in the same cash-gilded trap as Episode I and, to a far lesser extent, Return Of The Jedi.<br/><br/>EVERY scene is virtually screaming: ""We want to top the first one!"" But desperation never fares well in storytelling - especially in that genre. Someone had analyzed and dissected ""The Mummy"" into its 'obvious' aspects and labeled them for the sequel's spare parts depot. Nothing wrong in that - as long as someone has the wisdom to wait for the main ingredient which made the original a great movie: A good script. Almost every scene seems like a fast excuse for nifty visual effect. Almost every dialogue/gag seems like a carbon copy from the old script, just with an afterburner tied to every line. Pity that this time there isn't a decent story to bind the gags, and so it degenerates to a kind of choppy sitcom. That makes the fact that the gags are not half as good as the original's stand out even more.<br/><br/>The weakness of the script puts an incredible drag on the movie's natural pace, which had to be compensated by an ever faster sequence of 'highlights' piled on each other without any support from the story. The by far weakest aspect of the script is sadly also the one which - if done right - could've pushed the whole project into the class of ""The Mummy"": The Baddies. They failed on each of them in a different way, but always with the same result. No real threat. The Mummy itself suffered from the typical sequel disease. Totally overdone and drowned in FX. No match for its former truly scary and also dangerously luring 'glory'. (No blame on the actor. He wrestled an impossible foe: A story which didn't really give a toss about him.)<br/><br/>The Scorpion King: He was only a special effect right from the start until his bitter Playstation end. The Rock's attempts at 'Mineral wants to play Animal' didn't help there, of course. Such legends as the Scorpion King's aren't drawn from biceps but from real power - and The Rock's - I hesitate to say acting - was as powerful as a dead sheep plugged on to high voltage to make it twitch at the right moment.<br/><br/>Ankh-Su-Namun: In a way, she is by far the most tragic failure in the 'threat department', because she had the greatest potential to STILL pull off the impossible after the two main baddies had pulled out on grounds of million dollar invisibility. While everyone on the team was frantically busy to create one WHOW! after the other, nobody noticed that they had far more than just a stunningly beautiful lady waiting in the wings to make the air move. While everybody was hamming like mad, Patricia Velasques took hold of the painfully few effective scenes she had and tackled them with almost too extreme economy, which made her stick out even more. The camera mostly treated her like a beautiful ornament glued to the appropriate biceps, or doing what second row minions do before the big one is at hand. Seen like that, PV turned impossible odds into an advantage. Like a black jaguar prowling every scene - 'almost' too quiet - 'almost' too understated - and ALWAYS ruling the screen. Sure, Patricia Velasques is a looker to define all lookers, and therefore already reason enough to watch this movie on purely aesthetic reasons, but in her case that's really just the icing on the cake. She has real presence. Give her half a decent line and half a decent scene to chill already yawning viewers, and suddenly you've got your threat to consider beyond the next bunch of FX extravaganzas. But alas..., all was wasted. They never gave her more than the occasional bone to feed on - and the most pathetic exit of all. A few coffee filled nights of brainstorming over the script to make her the real and unexpected danger - the real power rising, when none of the ancient Uber-Hunks is looking - would've given this predictable rumble of testosterone a REAL twist. Dark and quietly moving danger as the perfect counterweight to unhinge all the loudness running amok.<br/><br/>Perfect. Ah, well...<br/><br/>As far as the 'goodies' are concerned, the acting was adequate and fitting the glossy but pretty empty frame. John Hannah, though, was even more wasted than in the first one, since they turned his character into a truly annoying fool, now. But on the whole, this goes for everyone on the cast. They were better than the story deserved. Hamming til the cows came out was the only way to give this wreck the fitting 'glue' and save it from falling totally apart.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the plus-side of this movie. Yes, there is one. Above all, it's fun, once expectations have been leveled to just that. And, oddly enough, it grows on you, if you're prepared to give it a second chance at home. Once, you've stopped caring for the overall story, you begin to appreciate the 'set pieces' - and there are quite a few to enjoy.<br/><br/>The effects range from stunning to ridiculous. The whole movie takes much less care of believability and coherence of atmosphere than the first one, and that's a serious drawback on the general tone. It's now closer to a Fantasy romp than an Indy type adventure. That's why - in the end - this movie's more like a collection of more or less good set pieces, failing to merge into a story, but also leaving some honestly entertaining moments behind. There are far worse ways to spend a fun evening at home.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Schogger13"

The acting is very top notch, and the Special Effects are just breathtaking to watch.

","Mummy Returns is, as expected, way worse than the origional.  It pales in comparison.  And, sadly enough, the first Mummy isn't very good at all!<br/><br/>So much to say why this movie didn't work: *SPOILERS AHEAD* 1. The plot is just cluttered with tons of legends, ancient stories, ancient artifacts, bracelets, spears, gods, armies of destruction and other such nonsense. ex. ""They wake up Ahmontep to wake up and kill the Scorpion King who made a pact with so-and-so and got condemmed for ever, so Ahmontep can have his dark army, but he needs the bracelet to wake him up, and some Spear to kill whoever, and who knows how the O'Connells got the spear in the first place.""  All of this confusing stuff is in the first 30 minutes, mind you, and everything plot-wise becomes cloudy and muddled.  The big problem with Mummy Returns, is that it's just not simple enough. 2.  All the heiroglyphics, that everyone can read, say dumb stuff that would nobody would ever bother to carve. ""This way to Scorpion King.""  ""He who disturbs this chest (there are numerous chests) will surely die.""  And why would they carve how to kill the Scorpion King (with the sceptre of Osiris) in his own temple?! 3.  The ever-annoying Alex.  He's way to brave and smart for his own good. He's not even cute, and his one-liners are very contrived and not funny. Why doesn't he just write the name of where they are going instead of building sand sculptures?  And where did he get that British accent?  His parents don't talk like that! 4.  The dazzling special-effects that we expect from every movie these days were non-existant.  The airship idea was incredibly stupid, and it didn't look that cool.  The tiny pygmies.  Where did they come from, and what is their purpose?  Who knows.  But they weren't that cool, and had no motivation.  I wasn't scared.  Anubis army, they were okay, but they looked awkward and most of all, fake.  And the graphics of the Scorpion King at the end were extremely laughable.  It looked like something out of a video game. As for the fight scenes, Is it just me or is anyone else sick of seeing slow-motion every time a punch is thrown? 5.  All aspects of the movie have failed, now it's time to see what we came for.  The Rock.  He's actually a pretty good actor.  Oh, wait, he's only in the movie for a few minutes in the beginning.  In spite of this, he graces almost every poster or promotional item for Mummy Returns.  Why didn't they place ""Bad Soldier #3"" on the poster?  I mean, he was in the movie just as long!  Another prime example of Hollywood just out to squeeze dollars out of everyone.<br/><br/>That concludes my synopsis.  When I see this type of movie I don't expect ""Citizen Kane,"" or Shakespeare, but I do expect something a little bit more valuable than this drivel.  Something that shows a worthy effort by the actors and the writing team, by someone who didn't read ""Archaeology for Dummies,"" before he started.  Anyways, watch the first Mummy or the perfect example of an action/adventure/comedy movie done right, ""Indiana Jones."" This movie is just another LOUD Hollywood Blockbuster sequel trying to make money off the coat-tails of the semi-popular predecessor.  In that respect, it succeeded marvelously.  Otherwise, it's just another forgettable film where nothing is tangible, nothing is sacred, nothing is genuine, nothing is good."
"kitsenugari","Null","1","2","18 July 2001"," The Sequel that Greed Built
","""The Mummy Returns"" is a very LOUD sequel that is really about 10 movies condensed into one.  Unfortunately, not one of those movies is very interesting.  Breaking down the plot to make sense would actually require a 10'x10' flowchart and a PowerPoint presentation, so I'll do my best without those.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with an army of people yelling at an army of snarling CG Enubis warriors.  One of those armies is led by The Scorpion King (Duane ""The Rock"" Johnson), who gets his power from a cumbersome bracelet.  There's a lot more yelling and screaming and somehow the King sells his soul to the God Enubis for the use of his army.  But for some reason the King can't use the army until he arises back from the dead at some point in time, which of course just happens to coincide with the rest of the events of the movie.  Confused yet?<br/><br/>A few centuries later, some people decide to wake up Imhotep, the mummy that we all thought died for sure in the first movie.  Obviously, these idiots didn't pay to see ""The Mummy"" 2 years ago or they'd know that whenever Imhotep wakes up he's always in a bad mood and feels like taking over the world.  Still, you'd think their reasons for resurrecting him would be justified.  Wrong.  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.  Nothing in this movie is justified.  <br/><br/>They want to wake up Imhotep because he's the only one powerful enough to kill the Scorpion King and his army of Enubis.  But whoever kills the King gets to take over the army, and so, once again, someone will have to kill Imhotep.  Can I ask something?  If Imhotep is more powerful than the S. King, and we don't think we can fight the King, how are we then supposed to kill the practically unstoppable Imhotep?<br/><br/>Wouldn't it make sense to just kill the Scorpion King and eliminate the middle mummy?  <br/><br/>Our usual heroes are back from the first movie: Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser); his wife Evelyn (vamped-out Rachel Wise); and the sexy Ardeth Bay (Oded Fahr), one of those Mummy guardian people who are SUPPOSED to keep all this disastrous stuff from happening in the first place. And now we also have Alex, Rick and Evelyn's love child.<br/><br/>After coming home to London from an expedition, Alex accidentally puts on the Scorpion King's magic bracelet and is then kidnapped by the people who happen to be resurrecting Imhotep in a nearby museum. So now Rick, Evelyn, and the usual gang must try and find their son before the Scorpion King wakes up and wants his jewelry back. <br/><br/>
On their way to find Alex, the group destroys a double-decker bus, sets fire to a library, somehow makes it back to Egypt, and recruits a token funny black guy to pilot a wishy-washy blimp that will take them to the Scorpion King's resting place.  Meanwhile, Ardeth has recruited all the guardians to help in the fight against one or more of the bad guys (pick one, who cares?).  The folks who kidnapped Alex are now accompanied by the resurrected Imhotep are also on their way to pay a visit to the Scorpion King.  Remember?  Imhotep is supposed to kill him, and we'll kill Imhotep.  Oy, and, as if there wasn't enough happening already, the gang encounters these pygmie-type gremlin things in a bizarre oasis outside the Scorpion King's pyramid.  The pygmies run around in the tall grass of the oasis and kill people.  They looked fake and were pretty pointless.  <br/><br/>Speaking of fake, if you blink at all while watching this movie, it's like missing out on $10,000,000 worth of computer graphics, including a wall of water that looks as if it were drawn in crayon by a 3 year-old, and a very fake Scorpion King in his ""scorpio"" form (I suppose the Rock was unavailable for pick-ups).  <br/><br/>Other than being visually assaulting, the soundtrack consists of a looping ""ARRRRRRRG!"" type sound, and, at the end, when everything inexplicably self-destructs, there's just a deafening ""WHOOOSSSSHHHH!"" mixed in with the ""ARRRRRGGGGG!""  Even the ending credits are loud.<br/><br/>This movie will make so much money."

","The Mummy Returns was possibly the most inconstitent movie I have ever seen. There were at least twenty times during the movie where the plot completely fell to pieces and the viewer was left so totally confused that there was nothing else to do but get lost in the incessant wave of visual effects, which were no where near as impressive as the previews made out.  I can't even begin to describe the plot holes that so confounded me with their stupidity that it made Independence Day look like a screenplay masterpiece worthy of Oscar recognition.  Of course, Brandon Fraiser was as wooden as ever, the British girl (whatever her name his) is just as annoying as every movie she has been in, the kid is ridiculous, and all the other characters don't even have enough personality between them to pull off the Olson twins on Full House.  Simply put, I'm so dumb struck by the sheer monstrosity this 'film' represents that I would prefer to watch every episode of Step by Step and Family Matters back to back before I would sit through that utter maggot-ridden garbage born from Satan's bowels.  Please, please, please- save your money, save your dignity, and save your kids- don't see it."

","In the history of terrible movies, the Mummy Returns ranks high with Batman and Robin and Plan 9 from Outer Space.  Behind the special effects and fight scenes, the movie was inconsistent plot connected with less-than-perfect acting.  i was a fan of the original Mummy, and am disapointed at a poor follow up.  not only that, but the comment posted by Jeff sounds like he is a producer for the movie.  He says things like ""non-stop action adventure"" and ""bring a friend and grab a soda"".  Do not see The Mummy Returns, it was poor."

There are SO many elements wrong with this film I could write a book on it, and just may someday provided I could ever sit through it again. The CGI animation is the least of the problems, but that in itself is so wretchedly done that you will either laugh out loud because it is so fake, or else get really annoyed beyond compare. There is a part where I actually wanted the young boy to go outside the temple rather than stay inside trying to revive his dead mother, just so he could be entertained by the cartoon show outside (an army of hundreds of thousands of cartoon jackals line up for battle). If you enjoy a movie that blatantly rips off Home Alone reactions, Titanic embraces on the stern of a ship, a vehicle that flies past the moon ala E.T., or a character dressed in the exact same costume Tom Cruise wore in the orgy scene of Eyes Wide Shut, then go see this movie!!

","The Mummy Returns (2001): Dir: Stephen Sommers / Cast: Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Dwayne Johnson, Freddie Boath: Extensive advertising given to great production values and the promise of more glorified violence. It opens with the reign of the Scorpion King who conquered many armies until his defeat. Left for dead, he gives his soul for revenge. Jump ahead a few centuries and Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz now have an annoyingly idiotic son who causes the ritual release of the Scorpion King because he has been taking stupid lessons from the screenwriter. They research the tombs because TV has not been invented yet. The rest is all action and outrunning bullets and tidal waves. Director Stephen Sommers manages to creates a mess with unlimited help from the cast. Fraser is required to run and fight while making narrow escapes and witless remarks. Weisz is plainly just there to prove that her talent is best suited somewhere else. John Hannah plays her less than swift brother. Freddie Boath plays the stupidest character in the film as the kid who fails to use his brain for anything. Finally there is Dwayne Johnson as the Scorpion King who starts out Intriguing until he becomes reduced to another playground fight. The special effects are the norm but hardly a saving factor.

","OK, maybe not the worst, but it's right up there with Battlefield Earth and Starship Troopers.<br/><br/>Did this movie have a director? Stephen Sommers gets the billing, but was he there? Did he see what was being filmed? I think there was a story...somewhere in there. I think there were actors... or they may have been robots programmed to recite lines- that's about as convincing as they appeared. The chemistry between Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz was about as believable as a Barry Bonds press conference. They're relationship was soooo contrived and forced- it was actually painful (really, I was in pain). I'm not a casting director, but when you're casting offspring shouldn't he/she resemble one or both of the parents? (re: Jonathan Carnahan) Imhotep and Acnk Su Namun sounded like they learned the Egytian Language from a free pamphlet at Cairo International Airport. These are just a few things that a director should notice and remedy before innocent people pay good money to watch.<br/><br/>I could go on and on and on... but this movie is fatally flawed in so many ways.<br/><br/>I think they should've replaced all the star billing with a listing of the special effects crew. They were the real stars of this film. If you want to see some great effects, rent (do not buy) this movie and skip to CGI scenes. They're great. If you want to see an action adventure movie, watch an Indiana Jones flick."

","I awaited the sequel to the smash hit The Mummy with great anticipation.  I thought the first movie was action-packed and possessed a great deal of charisma.  It was one of the films that I found hard not to like.  What happened in the sequel?  Where was that same magic?  Gone.  I sat through this film of contrived plot sequences, almost non-existent character development, and machine gun special effects and wished it would end soon. Literally, I could not wait till the ending.  The film was nothing but one special effect after another.  It had no real plot.  But worst of all, it lacked likable characters that populated the first film and gave it its charm.  Brandon Fraser was still here, but he just seemed too rushed to be funny.  The effects were crowding his comic style.  Rachel Weisz, who had an undeniable likability in the first film because of her awkwardness and shy demeanor, is transformed into a supermodel-archaeologist.  She looks like she just got out of a hair salon as she journeys through the Egyptian desert.  The background story is weak, and obviously an excuse to bring back characters from the first film(too bad they could not bring back Bernard Fox or Kevin O'Connor from the first film!).  Director Stephen Sommers really plays and panders to a far-less intelligent crowd in this one.  And that's too bad.  Instead of building on to something interesting and unique, he creates one cliche of a film with everything from the little boy who is smarter than his parents to the resorting to two scantily clad females in a cat-fight like sequence.  A big disappointment!"

","Both the original and this are great fun and completely likable.

But it does have a sense of unpretentious fun, and that is great to see. The visuals are very impressive, and the music score, this time by Alan Silvestri is very effective, though I do prefer the Goldsmith. Although he isn't given as much to do, Arnold Vosloo still impresses as Imhotep, who I admit I did find scary in the original, not so much here, but Vosloo's performance is great. The other performances are fine too, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are both charming in the lead roles, and Patricia Velasquez is just beautiful beyond words as Meela Nais/Arnk Su Namun. Plus Freddie Boath is perfectly tolerable as Alexander, and John Hannah is fine too, same with Allun Armstrong of all people. All in all, a fun sequel, that shows that more of the same can actually work. The only other sequel that I have seen that is more of the same yet lives up exactly to the standard of its original is Home Alone 2:Lost in New York. 7/10 for Mummy Returns. Bethany Cox"

","I am a big fan of mummy movies especially the new MuMmy films. I adore the first MuMmy and I just love The MuMmy Returns! I think the films are great, funny, and just spectacular! In My opinion they are some of the most accurate Egyptian movies out there. The movies are packed with tons of awesome action, tremendous special effects, great acting by all of the actors and actresses who I believe were born to play their roles in both films, great writing and directing by Stephen Sommers, and two of the most astounding scores ever by Jerry Goldsmith and Alan Silvestri! I love the history of ancient Egypt and I think that it is the most extraordinary history next to the time of the Dinosaurs and Prehistoric life! There are so many mysteries of Egypt that no one knows and some of it I believe is so incredible. One day we may find out how the wonders of Egypt were created and why the greatness and beauty of the designs look like the way they do. I believe the entire history means something special. Any way below is an In-depth look at most of the characters in The MuMmy Returns!<br/><br/>THE HEROES: <br/><br/>Brendan Fraser as Richard O'Connell - This big strong man is a former foreign legion leader and is now married to Evelyn Carnahan who saved his life from being hung by the late Warden Gad Hassan (Omid Djalili) and now has a young boy. He is a loving father and husband and will do anything for them. He is a great person and has become an avid adventurer thanks to a little help. Years ago after his future wife accidentally resurrected the high priest they won a battle that seemed unwinnable. Now the powerful mummy has been unearthed once again. Now the charming couple with the help of Evy's brother Jonathan, son Alex, and old friends Ardeth Bey, and Izzy must fight this incredible being once more.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz as Evelyn Carnahan O'Connell - Evy, as she called is having visions and after several of them she realizes that she was once a princess in ancient Egypt. She also realizes that it was no mistake meeting and marrying Rick. She loves her husband and son very much and like him she too will do anything for them. She will a have busy long while with old friends and foes.<br/><br/>John Hannah as Jonathan Carnahan - The loving brother of Evy. Though it seems like he is always prone to getting into some kind of trouble he does have some courage but whenever there is a time to find anything valuable he will take it especially gold!<br/><br/>Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay - This Medjai warrior is the leader of over ten tribes of thousands Medjai swordsmen and Bey himself is an excellent swordsman. Lock-Nah is part of the occult that is with Imhotep and will Ardeth finally settle the score with his arch-nemesis? His people have been the protector of the City of the Dead for over three millennia so no evil escapes. Thanks to spoilers nine years ago and a second resurrection of the creature they now have failed and must fight a battle that is impossible to win! <br/><br/>Freddie Boath as Alexander O'Connell - Alex is a smart young man who has smarts just like his parents. He loves Egypt and adventure. When he accidentally puts on the Bracelet of Anubis he will have a long adventure that will bring fourth another unforgettable journey!<br/><br/>Shaun Parkes as Izzy Buttons - Izzy and Rick O'Connell have had many adventures together. Now they along with Rick's lovely wife Evy, her good hearted but silly brother, and the brave Ardeth Bey will have the biggest adventure ever!<br/><br/>THE VILLAINS:<br/><br/>Arnold Vosloo as Lord Imhotep - The high priest was once resurrected and regenerated completely after sucking the life out of gun fighting Americans Mr. Henderson (Stephen Dunham), Mr. Daniels (Corey Johnson), Mr. Burns (Tuc Watkins), and Egyptologist Dr. Allen Chamberlain (Jonathan Hyde) nearly a decade ago. His huge dust storm that he created killed Captain Winston Havlock (Bernard Fox). He was also served by the late Beni Gabor (Kevin J. O'Connor) who betrayed Rick O'Connell. The creature as Ardeth Bey calls this misunderstood phenom was defeated by the O'Connells but now is brought back to life by Baltus Hafez and his secret occult. The reincarnated Anck Su Namun is in cahoots with this very occult and she is the one that led the current curator of the British Museum and his men to the area where the mummy was left buried. Soon they will be reunited and their love will an eternal love. It is the year of the scorpion and the Scorpion King is now superior and for someone to rule Anubis' army they must kill this incredible beast. Imhotep's power is much greater then ever before and he is the only one in the entire world that can defeat him.<br/><br/>Patricia Velasquez as Meela Nais - This bad beauty is the love of Imhotep. Her and Baltus Hafez's secret occult succeed at finding the mummy and will set fourth another campaign of destruction. Meela locks the door of one of the train cars and traps Red, Spivey, and Jaques and like the Americans they too get drained by Imhotep. Once fully regenerated he is more powerful than ever and soon he and his lover will be reunited.<br/><br/>Alun Armstrong as Baltus Hafez - Since the demise of Dr. Terrence Bey (Erick Avari) things have run amok in England. Baltus Hafez is now the current curator of the British Museum and is also the leader of the secret occult who has a very important mission. This red turban occult is armed with guns and ready for anything. He and Meela join forces to bring Imhotep back from the underworld. They know it is the year of the scorpion and they also know that the high priest is the only one powerful enough to destroy the Scorpion King! <br/><br/>Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Lock-Nah - This big and muscular master swordsman is the Curator's first hand man. Lock-Nah has had a feud with Medjai leader Ardeth Bey for many years and now is the time for them to settle it but who will prevail? <br/><br/>Bruce Byron as Red - Red is an intelligent killer and will stop at nothing at doing his job! <br/><br/>Joe Dixon as Jacques - This muscular man along with Spivey and Red is nobody to mess around with. He is as superstitious and as he is smart!<br/><br/>Tom Fisher as Spivey - Though maybe careless he is a killer along with Red and Jacques.<br/><br/>ANCIENT EGYPT CHARACTERS<br/><br/>The Rock as Mathayus the Scorpion King - After defeating Lord Memnon Mathayus became the first Pharaoh of Egypt. Mathayus was a great and intelligent fighter and he knew many fighting tactics. With his large muscular physique and brute strength he could defeat just about anyone with a weapon or in hand to hand combat. He was a master swordsman and archer. Just not a king but he was also an adored leader in battle. He led his Akkadian army of over twenty-thousand warriors against the Sumerian enemy which they too had an army of soldiers in the thousands. This battle between these two unstoppable legions lasted almost a decade. The Akkadians were eventually defeated. Mathayus and what was left of his fallen comrades walked the desert until they fell to their doom. Mathayus, on a sand dune got on his knees and begged the lord of the dead Anubis that if the dark lord would grant him an army to defeat the Sumerians he would give the dog faced one his soul. Anubis agreed and it was right then Mathayus and Anubis made a pact. Mathayus led the nine foot tall Anubis warriors and defeated the enemy. The underworld God then took Mathayus' soul. Though the Scorpion King never met the commanding personality called Imhotep due to them being in two different eras but thousands of years later it would be the year of the scorpion and Mathayus would be more powerful than ever only in a different body form and by a strange coincidence the high priest would return and he too would be super human. The two historic icons would have a meeting of Armageddon!<br/><br/>Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep - This man was a high priest, medicine man, and a philosopher. He was an intelligent individual. This handsome man had a relationship in secret with the Pharaoh's wife Anck Su Namun and later murdered her father with the help of his dream lover. After she killed herself he went to the City of the Dead to bring her back but failed and he suffered the most horrible curse and centuries later he would bring unbelievable catastrophes to man kind! <br/><br/>Aharon Ipalé as Pharaoh Seti I - The father of Princess Nefertiti and husband of Anck Su Namun. Seti I didn't know that his wife had a secret relationship with his high priest Imhotep and when he found out it cost him his life.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz as Princess Nefertiti - The daughter of Pharaoh Seti I was a skilled fighter. Though she was beaten in a battle against Anck Su Namun she was chosen by her father to guard the bracelet of Anubis and she witnessed the slaying of her dear father. <br/><br/>Patricia Velasquez as Anck Su Namun - The wife of Pharaoh Seti I was a beautiful but an evil woman. She defeated the Pharaoh's daughter and became his protector. She along with her other lover Imhotep killed Seti I and later done her own self in after Imhotep was taken away.<br/><br/>Movie Nuttball's NOTE:<br/><br/>If you love mummy films I recommend the following: The Mummy (1932), The Mummy (1959), The Monster Squad (1987) The Mummy Lives (1993), Tale of the Mummy (1998), The MuMmy (1999), The Scorpion King (2002), The MuMmy: The Animated Series (2001), and The MuMmy: QUEST FOR THE LOST SCROLLS (The MuMmy: The Animated Series (2001) VHS movie), and Bubba Ho-Tep (2002)!"
"Movie-12","2","1","7","4 June 2001"," One of the year' worst movies, another mindless special effects extravaganza. * (out of four)
","THE MUMMY RETURNS / (2001) * (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>	I can tell you exactly what happened with ""The Mummy Returns."" The filmmakers of ""The Mummy"" were in stitches of the huge success of the first film and quickly had the original actors sign for a sequel. They got the green light based on the box-office grossing of the first film, and probably started shooting before the first draft of the script was complete. The results of this shallow, mind-numbing array of visual effects are ridiculous, frenetic, and spontaneous-one of the year's worst films. It proves when a movie is made with the intentions of grossing a lot of money, it does not provide audiences with much more than visual stimulation.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" was one of the biggest box office hits in 1999, but even that was no cinematic masterpiece. Considering the rule of thumb that the original film is always better than its sequel, my expectations for ""The Mummy Returns"" were not especially high. I expected the same kind of movie, where the plot is simply a clothesline for lots and lots of special effects and high-tech action sequences. I was right on the money, but I never expected the movie to be this horrible. <br/><br/>	 The plot in the original mummy' was kind of interesting-but in ""The Mummy Returns,"" the filmmaker's do not really supply us with a plot-but with a string of incidences that setup for yet another pestering sequel. ""The Mummy Returns"" opens with professional wrestler The Rock playing the Scorpion King, a warrior who trades his soul to a god in exchange for military victory, but becomes frozen in time. Most of the original film's actors reprise their roles; Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and John Hannah as protagonists and Arnold Vosloo as the antagonist. Director and writer Stephen Sommers also returns, with a script created for the sole purpose of making a sequel. <br/><br/>	I will not waste my time with a detailed plot synopsis. The film is much too incompetent for such an explanation. Besides, does the story really matter? If you chose to see this film, it will not be because of a thought-provoking story, or even an interest in the actors, but because it is a big-budget, special effects extravaganza. Many people will see this film-my guess is that they will walk away loving the action and visual effects, but once out of the theater this movie may never account in their minds again. It is forgettable, disposable, recycled junk-and you do not even have to think. Before you see this movie, park your brain outside the theater, you will not be needing it. <br/><br/>	What about the action sequences and special effects? Even that aspect of ""The Mummy Returns"" fails miserably. The action scenes are predictable, superficial, and relentless. Action scenes relieve suspense. In this film, they occupy the tension-free plot. The film never builds for any suspense or momentum. This would not be a major problem if ""The Mummy Returns"" had other redeeming factors-but the whole thing is one extended action sequence. The insignificant exhilaration never stops to take a breath. Watching this movie is just like watching ""The Mummy"" again, but this time we expect every occurrence and see every turn coming from a mile away. The ""Indiana Jones"" similarities become even more obvious. The film also introduces several new horror creatures, including a Scorpion monster so badly created that many audience members laughed at its sheer presence."
"jboothmillard","5","1","8","23 June 2005"," The Mummy Returns
","If you liked the original 1999 story of an Egyptian monster brought back to life, then you might like the sequel. The film starts with the story of The Scorpion King (wrestler The Rock) who swore an oath and his soul to the god Anubis, and after he had done what he wanted, they all returned to the sands, waiting to be woken again. Then it is 1933, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is still exploring Egyptian places, along with wife Evelyn ""Evie"" (Rachel Weisz) and their son Alex (Freddie Boath). Soon after returning to London, the bad guys have brought the body of High Priest Imhotep, and they just need the bracelet of The Scorpion King to help him take over the world. They bring Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) back, and he is reunited with the body (no soul yet) of Meela Nais, aka Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez). They do eventually get the bracelet, that is on the arm of Alex, and with his help they navigate their way round Egypt to find the burial of The Scorpion King so Imhotep can kill him. Meanwhile, Rick, Evie, Jonathan (John Hannah), Medjai Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) and balloonist Izzy Buttons (Human Traffic's Shaun Parkes) they are following Alex's trail and trying to help Alex before the sun rises and sucks the life out of him. Eventually they save Alex, and the bracelet is taken by the guy responsible for bringing Imhotep back, but the Madjai still have to fight off the army of Anubis soldiers, aka dog soldiers (LOL), Evie (or Princess Nefertiri) is fighting Anck Su Namun, and Rick is fighting now mortal and powerless Imhotep, as well as The Scorpion King, who has turned into a giant scorpion, a lot of fights. Also starring Alun Armstrong as Baltus Hafez and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Lock-Nah (now in TV's Lost). The story is still quite cheesy, but the special effects are much more elaborate. Rachel Weisz was number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses. Worth watching!"

","I have fun watching the movie, again. I think that, funny enough, here you feel more the dated CGI than in the 1999 film (cof cof Scorpion King cof cof). I'm totally analyzing this movie through a whole different perspective tho.<br/><br/>First, the good stuff. I like the first 1/3 of the movie for real, the scenes in the tombs and in London are cool, some good scenes, and that fight with the Mummy on the bus is great. I like Evelyn a whole lot more this time around, she is a badass, even though I still not shipping them as a couple. She at least isn't totally helpless.<br/><br/>Again, Fraser is great as the lead. And at first, I didn't like the kid, but afterwards I loved his chemistry with his uncle. The movie definitely goes for a more comic tone than the first one.<br/><br/>Right when they meet the balloon guy, the movie lost me a bit. Here we have some truly bad CGI moments (with the night sky, and also the part at the lake with the face). And man, that whole Evelyn is actually a reincarnation too was horrible. This and the whole ""I have a tattoo that says something"" stuff with Rick is just bad, and used as a reason to tie everything together (but did we really need this?). The next 1/3 of the movie lost me again. Also, where was this reincarnation of Anck Su Namun in the first movie? C'mon, don't do that. Everything here goes against what they did in the first movie.<br/><br/>The third act tho. My god the third act. I love everything about it (mostly the last 30 minutes). But for all the wrong reasons. Of course, the kid resurrects his mom! Anck Su Namun leaves Imhotep to die lmao. And MY GOD the Scorpion King! I love every minute he's on screen. Is so bad, but so damn entertaining. And of course, who didn't see the ex machina factor coming a mile away at the end?<br/><br/>This is by no means a better film than The Mummy (1999), it manages to have some truly awful CGI (and being known for it) even tho it was released 2 years after the original. However, the first 30/40% of the movie are good, the next 30/40% are bad, but the last 20/30% are freaking awesome, the big fight scene with a CGI The Rock against young Brendan Fraser. I can't wait to watch The Scorpion King."

","This film begins in ancient times with a warrior known as ""the Scorpion King"" (Dwayne Johnson) amassing an army for which he intends to conquer the known world. To his dismay he is soundly defeated while besieging Thebes and as a consequence he is left wandering in the desert with no food or water. It's then that he prays to the Egyptian god Anubus and promises his soul for the opportuntity to defeat his enemies one last time. True to his word, Anubus grants this request by conjuring up an army of jackal warriors for which the Scorpion King does indeed conquer everything in his path to include the city of Thebes. But as soon as he tastes his hard-fought victory Anubus claims soul of the Scorpion King along with the army given to him. The scene then shifts to five thousand years later with an archeologist named ""Rick O'Connell"" (Brendon Frazer) and his wife ""Evelyn O'Connell"" in the process of exploring a tomb near ancient Thebes. Also with them is their young son ""Alexander O'Connell"" who discovers a small chest which contains a gold bracelet. Upon putting it on his wrist he suddenly sees a vision of where the Scorpion King's sepulcher is located. Not long afterward, the curator of the British Museum resurrects the mummy of ""Imhotep"" () who plans on resurrecting the Scorpion King for the purpose of killing him and assuming command of his army in order to conquer the world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie had numerous sub-plots which became rather confusing at time. Likewise, the inclusion of numerous action scenes and CGI in lieu of any noticeable suspense or horror was also a feature which lessened the overall potential this film could have had. Be that as it may, while it certainly wasn't a bad film by any means, it could have been much better and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

","I'm a fan of the first movie from 1999 and was naturally looking forward to this 2001 sequel. I originally saw it at the theater with two friends; after about 10-15 minutes we were all bored by the bombardment of action and F/X. We just laid back in our seats in tedium for the remaining couple hours.<br/><br/>It's a curious thing that too much action and F/X in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true; and ""The Mummy Returns"" is Exhibit A. I usually give certain movies second and third chances in the hope that my first impression may have been in error, which I've done with this one over the years. Unfortunately I keep finding myself relatively detached from the story even though there are all kinds of exciting things going on; or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.<br/><br/>""The Mummy Returns"" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. (although some of the CGI is woefully cartoony, like the Scorpion King at the close). It has great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a forgettable piece of cinematic dung. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. ""The Mummy Returns"" abandons the characters while the plot is utilized as a clothesline for action and F/X sequences.<br/><br/>The flick curiously has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails to absorb the viewer. It is unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance or overKILL: having all the right elements, including budget, and yet stupefyingly fumbling the ball.<br/><br/>The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes (overlong), and was shot in England, Morocco, Jordan and Egypt.<br/><br/>GRADE: C-"

"johnnyboyz","5","0","1","14 May 2011"," The Mummy does indeed return: displeasingly; in what is, frankly, a sequel at the lower end of what is moderately acceptable.
","I rather liked the first Mummy film, I rather liked its knowing attitude towards its rip-roaring and somewhat guilty content; I liked the way it had its characters just walk off into the desert sunset when everything had been said and done. The film's overall framework was satisfyingly closed, evil had been defeated and its undercurrent of romance that the lead and the leading female shared had been introduced as disparate at best; developed and then rounded off in a pleasing manner – if we'd never again seen Rick or Evy or Jonathan, despite how fond of them we'd become by the time The Mummy ended, we'd have been happy. Steven Sommers' 2001 sequel, entitled The Mummy Returns, does precisely what it says on its proverbial tin; the dragging of some of these people back into a firing line of stunts and special effects complete with a few new faces, most of them as unwelcome as the arriving of the film is as a whole and most of the content this time tired and dreary.<br/><br/>As with the first, the film begins with a somewhat out of place back-story full of gory and grotesque minor details more broadly linked to a seedier bigger picture around which decrepit acts are unfolding. In the first, two people had an illicit affair which lead to tongues being removed from the mouths of those guilty, and for those whom got off lightly, live mummification; a process one ought to point out is wholly impossible for a duration of longer than about half a second. Here, we observe a great warrior and king in Dwayne Johnson's character, without provocation, gobble down a live scorpion after his power mad but ultimately failed attempts at the conquest of varying kingdoms go array. The reasoning for the arthropodic snack lies in the pact he makes with a war God - the wolfing down of a live scorpion its activation and the first of many instances in which characters do crazy, off-the-cusp things purely to lead us onto greater extents of spectacle driven content. The results allow the now infamous Scorpion King to sweep across most of his land, killing all in his way but arriving with the catch that he won't really be in much of a position to enjoy any of it since his soul is swiped and he is doomed exist cursed. Indeed, the conquest carries with it an air of pointlessness; I guess people were just more aggressive and power hungry way-back-when.<br/><br/>Centuries later, in 1933, the O'Connell's, in Fraser 's Rick and Weisz's Evelyn, are back; here complete with a new face in the form of son Alex (Boath) as well as John Hannah's Jonathan who's actually the funniest thing in the film. How we can tell Alex keeps it in the family is in his activation of a number of pillars toppling into one another alá his mother's pratfalls in the library in which she worked during the first. Where they are is an isolated tomb somewhere, the family's introduction as a working unit seeing them intermingle and combine in an array of goofy ways to eventually get whatever job or quest they were initially there for complete. The opening, in its cave chock full of floors of creepy-crawlies is very post-Temple of Doom; the removing of a statuette causing the whole temple to cave in rather sub-Raiders of the Lost Ark. You'd have to be a very stupid person to go into these films not knowing that they owe a great debt to Spielberg's then-trilogy of Jones movies, but this just takes the cake.<br/><br/>Evil forces, however, lurk; the bringing about of the High Priest Imhotep (Vosloo), he of the first movie, out of his slumber by a cult its revealed is way out of its own comfort zone kicking off all manner of nastiness – the ultimate goal to resurrect the Scorpion King and steal his armies and power so as to rule over all for once and for all. The film itself is peppered with an array of instances and happenings which do not makes sense, the bulk of it special effects driven masking wafer thin plotting; the troupe of heroes' eventual enlisting of the help of a black hot air balloon pilot a sort of replacement for the firsts' Benni so as to induce a love/hate buddy relationship with Rick just disappointing. On other occasions, the film will branch out into another back story in which that of Evy is involved; her premonitions of being present during ancient Egyptian times and in the company of Imhotep and co. handy for plot conveniences but arrives with the fact the man himself was in her presence and yet has never recognised her – to be fair, I suppose he's had a lot on his mind in the intermingling thousand years. Things lead onto other things; the encountering of some four foot high monsters nearer Johnson's domain puzzling in that they appear deterrents, but why wouldn't The Scorpion King want to be awoken? <br/><br/>The Mummy Returns retains the familiarity of the first but lacks the fun, as if Sommers is trying to 'top' material which was never there to be done in any other manner than knowing and self-aware. It is epitomised by the instances of Rick's casual jabs at generic code and convention, which worked with the 1999 first film, but here, is delivered in a flat and disparaging fashion. Sommers is sticking true to what his returning character might say, even though it counteracts with what it is he actually thinks of the material, ie; as something that can be played for something other than smiles and smirks. Flimsey, loose and not nearly as involving nor as fun as the first; Sommers drops the ball with The Mummy Returns, a film which removes the pleasures of the first and mishandles the contexture to produce an effort high on goofiness more than anything."

","I've learned that the sequel to a blockbuster hit is always risky business - especially if that film was a well-crafted film to begin with. Many such attempts have failed miserably, while rare cases have been worthy follow-ups. The much-anticipated sequel to Stephen Sommers' ""The Mummy"" lies somewhere in-between those two categories. ""The Mummy Returns"" is indeed an entertaining film that'll have you laughing hard and keeping you on the edge of your seat. But as a film of intelligence and integrity, it falls short in almost every way.<br/><br/>In the featurette found under the Special Features of this set, Stephen Sommers confesses that he is a great fan of everything Egypt. However, I find this statement highly ironic considering the fact that the underlying plot of ""The Mummy Returns"" degrades the very heritage of Egyptian mythology. Long ago, a defeated desert warrior, the Scorpion King, made a pact with the dark god Anubis. Together, the two defeated the Scorpion King's enemies, but Anubis subsequently made the Scorpion King his slave and his army fell dormant. If you'll look into Egyptian mythology, Anubis is the god of the dead, who prepares the dead for the afterlife and takes them to the Hall of Judgement; he was never an evil god. To see him presented in such a mutated form as he appears in this film is nothing short of sacrilege to me. Perhaps Sommers was thinking of the god Set (who wasn't even always evil in the Egyptians' book). Either way, I set into this movie with a feeling of anger, not anticipation.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie proves to be as short on plot as the opening scene, mostly serving to keep the action going and to perhaps induce a few laughs rather than maintain the movie's believability. Our heroes from the first film, Rick and Evelyn, are now happily married as the O'Connells, and have travelled to an unknown temple with their son Alex to unravel the mystery of a dream Evelyn had. While that mystery has the edge on the film's plot development, the rest can hardly be described as such. Alex unwittingly slips on a cursed bracelet, and meanwhile Imhotep is being revived by a secret faction, whose goal is to defeat the Scorpion King and take control of Anubis' army - and by so doing rule the world. Thus a haphazard chain of reactions is set in motion including dirigibles, pygmy mummies, full-on battles between Medjai and (sigh) Anubis' warriors, and even a double-decker bus! When you've got all that together in a film, it somehow loses its integrity.<br/><br/>The most serious problem is that the plot hardly makes any sense, and contradicts the first film numerous times, e.g. in bringing people back to life being strangely easier than in the first film, and the timeline being off, meaning that Alex should have been born before the first film took place! Oddly, NewLine Cinema decided to mitigate the latter with subsequent DVD releases of the original rather than the sequel, staging it a few years earlier! The only thing I find worth watching about ""The Mummy Returns"", apart from the mystery of Evelyn's dream and the excellently-crafted Anubis and army (courtesy of IL&M), are the interactions between the spotlight characters. Rick and Evy are endlessly entertaining as a couple (Rachel Weisz having matured a lot in her role since the first film), though not as much as John Hannah as the trouble-inducing Jonathan, almost solely responsible for the film's considerable comic level (apart from Izzy, the entertaining sky pirate). So an action adventure film this is, with all the comedy present just like in the first film. And yet the plot is so nonsensical and its development so haphazard that the film miserably fails at its attempt at being a solid piece of film-making - if indeed it was intended as such.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Mummy Returns"" feels more like an endless explosion of special-effects than much else, once again showcasing the brilliance and professionalism of Industrial Light & Magic (IL&M). Especially (groan) Anubis and his warriors are very aesthetic and well-done. But the haphazard, no-sense majority of this movie is not the deserving place for such talent and creation."

","There is no excuse for this. This was, literally, the worst big-budget movie in 2001.<br/><br/>I won't disagree with the 'cartoony' feel of the thing. If that's the way you want to go with it - you want to take a classic horror movie and turn it into something horrific because it'll get the little kids to drag mommy and daddy in, then that's fine. You bought the rights, have at it. And it's even possible to enjoy someone raping cinema history as Sommers did here, I'm sure, if it's done well.<br/><br/>This wasn't.<br/><br/>I'll just give you two examples. Please bear in mind that these are merely examples, they are by no means 'the only two problems with the movie' but they are two of the biggest.<br/><br/>First of all Alex is left in Lock-Nah's care. Here is a gentleman who has survived in some of the harshest environments in the world, and in this movie we're to believe that he'll just grudgingly do whatever Alex tells him because he can't murder the kid. You have taken suspension of disbelief too far. As an audience member I wanted to pin his hand to a table with a knife and tell him that if he needed a drink to pee his pants and suck the moisture out of the fabric, because he's not going anywhere. But we're to believe that a man who lives in areas where people would sooner kill you just for thinking you're a thief than bother to call the authorities would just groan and do as he's told by this brat. No dice, Sommers, you moron.<br/><br/>Secondly (and this is just an even worse version of something that happened in the first one, actually) at the end, when verses need to be spoken to perform 'magic', huge conversations are carried on in the midst of it. ""Magic magic magic . . . hey, how do I say this? Yeah, this right here! Are you sure? Oh, yeah, that's it! Alright, thanks! Hey, how're things going? Doing well? Awesome, awesome. Well, I'd better get on with saving the world from hordes of the undead! Yeah, I know, every summer, right?! Ha! Anyway . . . magic magic magic."" By Sommers' logic, we should all be casting magic spells every day, because at some point, you're going to have uttered all the syllables in the right order. Just more poorly-thought-out crap that anyone with an IQ over 80 could spot the hole in with about 2 1/2 seconds of thought, but Sommers has so little respect for his audience that he just tosses it in there so that he can build tension.<br/><br/>In other words: Sommers wanted a visual spectacle to be delivered, and he did so. He wanted mummies in there, and there were. He wanted Brendan Frasier, and there is. He wanted Egyptian women trained in and fighting with Asian weapons (in ancient Egypt) and for some reason, there are. He wanted a ""precocious"" child (read: freaking insufferable little turd begging to be thrown from a plane, sans parachute) and he got one. What Sommers did not give a crap about was a coherent setting that's consistent with itself, much less the real world. Because Sommers clearly has the intelligence of a dung beetle, and expects you to as well."

","""The Mummy Returns"" is the bigger and flashier sequel to 1999's ""The Mummy"", itself a nicely updated homage to the Boris Karloff classic. The good news is that the excellent cast of the ""The Mummy"" have returned for the sequel. Unfortunately, bigger and flashier does not make up for a lack of plot and character development; ""The Mummy Returns"" is entertaining but ultimately disappointing. The movie opens with a retelling of the Legend of the Scorpion King (played by The Rock) who vanished in ancient times but can be revived with the right magic. Flash forward to the present of 1933, where Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) have married and had time to raise eight-year-old son Alex while continuing their adventures in Egyptian archeology. Unfortunately, the past, both recent and distant, reaches out to touch their lives. Rachel's never-do-well brother Jonanthan (John Hannah) inadavertently draws the attention of a mysterious group seeking to resurrect the past using a bracelet with magical powers. In a chaotic attack on O'Connell Manor, Alex, wearing the bracelet, is kidnapped. The remainder of the movie is a series of set-piece action sequences as Rick, Evie, and Jonathan, accompanied by the Egyptian warrior Ardeth Bey, chase the returned Mummy Imhotep and his army of the dead in order to rescue Alex. A final confrontation at the edge of the Underworld will pit Rick against both Imhotep and the revived Scorpion King. The special effects are the highlight of the movie, each sequence more visually stunning than the last. The Scorpion King in the final scenes looks sadly out of place is what is otherwise a CGI festival. Lacking is a coherent plot or any sense of reverence for the original storyline that made ""The Mummy"" worth watching. At two and a half hours, the movie is overlong, and delivers very little originality. This movie is recommended to those who didn't see the original movie and will enjoy the special effects without missing the storyline."

","Going in to see this movie, i was not concerned with historical accuracy. It's a movie about a freaking resurrected mummy, for crying out loud, i think that should be anyone's first hint that viewers are in for a nice little detour from reality, and all tghe better for it. Picking up several years after the adventures of the first film, we rejoin what is now the O'Connell family as they cross paths with Imhotep once again, this time in an effort to stop him from raising a supernatural army that would allow him to conquer the world. The Mummy Returns is the sort of movie that makes a fun distraction on a lazy Saturday afternoon, not unlike the hokey, cheesy (but nonetheless entertaining) monster movies i grew up with. If you can put down your pretensions that every movie should be or should even strive to be the highest form of art, make yourself some popcorn, sit back, put a few parts of your brain in neutral and just enjoy the ride.

First of all, they could've made the scorpion king look way cooler by putting his real head there instead of an animated one on the scorpion body. yes, by this i definitely mean decapitate him and place his head on a giant scorpion. By him i mean the rock, which i recently discovered means 'the skirt' in German. My brother and i, on a slightly different topic, find it quite amusing to play this movie backwards, but about the movie itself: going forwards not backwards. The Mummy Returns is basically the mummy again with cooler things in it such as the Pygmy mummies with blowguns. Once again it has intriguing special effects and an interesting storyline, with a nice bit of humour thrown in along the way. although not as interesting or good as the first one, i would suggest seeing this movie for your greater good.

","I love commenting on shows that generate such diversity of opinions. There are many people who seemed to love the Mummy Returns and an equal if not more hated it! To me I think those who hated it (i.e gave it 1 or 2 out of 10) often fail to see what the show was really intended for and go down to the technicalities of it all..That is was the script good, were the special effects serviceable, were the characters well presented. All of these areas are important but they pale into insignificance when all the show is there for is to entertain.<br/><br/>Now lets face it...this would not and did not win Oscars at the year of its release so if you want an Oscar worthy movie watch Gladiator or Titanic. But if you want a movie where you can check your brain at the door and enjoy a rollicking good old fashioned action adventure yarn then this is it.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns can be summed up in two words....Bigger, Better. Everything is on a grander scale compared with the first one. More action, bigger threat and a larger scope. For Hollywood sequels that's what they do in action sequels...look at Xmen 2, Empire Strikes Back, Spiderman etc.<br/><br/>The action is non-stop and has some great skin of your teeth type moments which are similar to George Lucas and Steven Spielberg movies based on the 1930's republic serials. The characters have changed notably Rachel Weisz's character but remember this is set 9 years after the original so this is believable. The son also is believable to a certain point as he would be influenced by his parents and the relationship he shares with his father is very touching.<br/><br/>Imhotep has definitely been humanised and he turns out to be the sympathetic bad guy. The bad guys are all good except the Rock. he is very one-dimensional in this but then he didn't get much screen time.<br/><br/>Overall I thought the movie was good. Look at what it is for what it is...just a goofy action movie that was purely made to entertain and try not to read into it too much.<br/><br/>Just enjoy!!!"

Like its predecessor, ""The Mummy Returns"" never gets dull or boring and although it is still just lots of fun, most of it silly fun, is highly entertaining for this reason.<br/><br/>Most of the traits that make ""The Mummy Returns"" effective are described in my review of the first ""The Mummy"" so I will not begin to restate them again and just advise readers to check the aforementioned review for my ideas on why I think this film and the one before it are excellent and good enough to be called quintessential action-comedies. ""The Mummy Returns"", in short, is well-paced, full of action, has intelligent and well-acted laughs, a great cast of characters, sword fights, gunfights, fist fights, doesn't become too serious in any of its traits, is not too scary or frightening, and although not as good as the original, is still very fun to watch."

Oded Fehr returns as Ardeth Bay, the anti-hero from the first movie who plays a much larger role than in the original where he's more of a hero and ally.<br/><br/>It's good fun, but it takes too much formula of the original movie from the special effects, including a water chase sequence that looks like the sand chase from the first movie. There's also a character in the film called Izzy where his name sounds like a derivate of Beni just like in the original. There's more screams and surprises than in the original where there's hardly any laughs despite one or two scenes."
"elshikh4","6","0","1","8 February 2008"," When The Exaggeration was Scarier than The Mummy !
","The morning after (The Mummy) was released, its producers at (Universal) phoned its talented and diligent director (Stephen Sommers) asking him: ""We need another one!"". And the rest is history.. and foolishness as well!<br/><br/>It's not that bad at all. On the contrary, it tries to be bigger than the first one, achieving dazzling image, hot pace, being like vivacious comic book. However, while the first movie was a lesson in how to make a pure cinematic adventure full of action, thrill, comedy and imagination to the extreme, this one is weaker and less cohesive. I think, this time, it exceeded the extreme; and that was a problem!<br/><br/>Script wise, it was crowded. The long flashback in the movie's middle weakened the flow, there were too many storylines, and the dramatic logic of the whole thing was flimsy; for instances: Who's that modern girl with the soul of a ""Anck Su Namun""?, how ""Imhotep"" did get his life back after being mortal in the first one?, how the scorpion king will destroy the world?!, moreover why did the god of evil betray him in the first place?!, well, it'll be so silly indeed to add also the historical corrections for the main story; but who cares? It's a crazy action fantasy after all; which became here a very brainless one too!<br/><br/>The CGI was hasty and embarrassingly needy sometimes. I see that its aspiration was more than the movie's abilities, and this is obvious at the visual momentum of the climactic sequences.<br/><br/>The outcome was a cross between (Indiana Jones) movies & (The Lost World - 1997), however heavy, vociferous, and a little poor. I know that I got a headache because of it. So its impressiveness fades away after the watching, and lessens as time goes by. Not like part one, (The Mummy - 1999), which is close to iconic ""B"" movie and still that young and entertaining till now, unlike its idiotically exaggerated sequel that destroyed itself by its own exaggeration."

","This movie is a typical sequel, meaning that everything is bigger. More action, more special effects, more comedy, more new characters and more different plot lines. Is it all better? Perhaps if the movie was more original and not so much an extension of the first movie, then perhaps it would had been.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first ""The Mummy"", you'll probably also enjoy watching this movie. It's in the same style and follows the same characters, with just a few more new adjustments to it. Not all are for the best though.<br/><br/>Compared to the first movie, this movie obviously has an highly budget and it uses this for some more big scale battles, at the beginning and end of the movie. It also puts in some overall more action sequences and more traveling elements, which helps to provide the movie with its fun and adventurous feeling.<br/><br/>They also tried to put some more layers into the story, involving the same characters from the first movie but none of this ever really works out, since these plot line differ way too much from the characters as we got introduced to in the first movie. There also are some new characters in the movie. The O'Connell's now have a son. Why oh why do movies always feel the need to put in kids into the story. As a matter of fact the character is quite entertaining in the movie but at the same time annoying because he just feels so completely redundant. Luckily John Hannah is still present for the comical notes of the movie and Arnold Vosloo as the charismatic mummy. This is the role he definitely will be remembered for, even though it isn't a very demanding role.<br/><br/>Very much like the first movie launched the careers of Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, this movie launched the acting career of The Rock. Yes he's painfully horrible in this movie, despite having no lines but he's such a great new action hero star. He definitely is the new Arnold Schwarzenegger, who obviously also wasn't the best actor around but still a big and popular one. It was also fun to see Alun Armstrong in the movie, though he's hard to recognize. Also Patricia Velasquez's role has been extended, which is a welcome thing.<br/><br/>Like most sequels, it's tries (too) hard to surpass its first movie, in terms of size and spectacle. Yes, it provides the movie with some great moments but yet the movie feels more of the same. It's not a bad thing, since the movie is still perfectly fun and entertaining but its lack of originality and new ideas is disturbing at times and makes me worried for ""The Mummy 3"", if there is ever going to be such a movie.<br/><br/>The ending is sort of an anti-climax, when a computer animated scorpion king appears, that looks nothing like The Rock and looks as if it came straight out of a playstation game. It's a bit of a disappointing ending but luckily the rest of the movie is good enough to compensate for this and still make this is perfectly fun and watchable movie.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"LadyPagan","5","0","1","14 December 2006"," Inaccurate Egyptology: ""Evil"" god Anubis?!?!?
","As an amateur Egyptian mythologist and Isiac reconstructionist, I have a couple of problems with this movie and it's predecessor, ""The Mummy."" Both were recently played back-to-back on the SciFi channel, so I got a chance to refresh my vague memory of them from several years ago. I watched ""The Mummy,"" and basically enjoyed it as an utter yarn, with one or two nit-picks (Seti I murdered by his high priest? Huh?). The thing that stuck in my craw the most was the bit about the vicious, flesh-eating scarabs. Scarabs are DUNG BEETLES! They eat dung, never live prey. Ever! They may occasionally feast on decayed vegetation and possibly even the rotted flesh of corpses, but they generally prefer the dung of livestock and are, themselves, a favorite snack of Egyptian bats. It was a minor issue and the FX were cool, so I let it slide ... sort of.<br/><br/>I was far less forgiving with ""The Mummy Returns,"" which I turned off in disgust after about the first five minutes. The reason? Its portrayal of Anubis as a snarling, ""evil"" and ""dark god"" (I'm quoting words from the movie itself) was offensive and inaccurate, if not outright sacrilege. According to Egyptian mythology, the jackal- or dog-headed god, Anubis, was not and IS not evil, even though his alleged father, Set, might be characterized as such.<br/><br/>For those who don't know: Anubis is the Egyptian god of the dead and dying, who protects and ushers the recently deceased into the afterlife, most commonly referred to as the Underworld (not to be confused with Hell, mind you). He is at once ruler, guard and judge of who is fit and deserving to enter the utopian Underworld by a test known as the Weighing of the Heart. (Sort of the Egyptian equivalent of St. Peter.) He was spared from death as an infant by the goddess Isis and remains Her loyal companion and protector (much like the faithful family dog). He is said to have taught the art of mummification and funerary rites to the Egyptians priests. He is also viewed by some as the patron god of lost souls and orphans. Dark? Perhaps, inasmuch as death may be considered dark. But, evil? Absolutely not. And I have come across no tales of Anubis ever having had an ""evil army"" as the ""The Mummy Returns"" portrays being led by the Scorpion King. This notion is so ridiculous it's almost funny. Almost.<br/><br/>Either the consultants on this movie did not do their research, or they've watched the original ""The Omen,"" with the skeletons of demonic Damien's jackal-headed parents being unearthed in the Egyptian desert (and the obvious allusion to Anubis), far too many times.<br/><br/>In any case, I was turned off by either the sloppy ignorance or the intentional maligning of Egyptian divinity. As others have stated here, there are even errors in the continuity in the timeline and ""historical"" references between the two films themselves, which might shed some light on the reasons for the mistakes in Egyptian mythology.<br/><br/>I really wish Hollywood would get its act together when making action, horror or drama movies featuring pagan gods. I tend to get a little testy about how easily the label ""evil"" is applied in such cases. And for every ""DaVinci Code"" and ""Last Temptation of Christ,"" there are about a dozen other films that have served to spread fallacious and pernicious ideas about paganism. And yet, the last I checked, no Christians have had to go into hiding because of a vapid movie twisting the Catholic rite of Communion into a carnal act of cannibalism. And I can't help but be critical when mainstream movies such as this one, mold deities from other cultures into sinister action figures for an audience that may not realize that what they're seeing is a complete lie.<br/><br/>Blessings of Isis, <br/><br/>Lady P"

","The Mummy Returns begins in 'Egypt 1933' where the now married Rick (Brendan Fraser) & Evelyn O'Connell (Rachel Weisz) are on the trail of an ancient artifact called The Bracelet of Anubis, a bracelet that belonged to the evil Mathayus the Scorpion King (The Rock) centuries ago. Meanwhile at Hamunaptra the city of the dead the evil Baltus Hafez (Alun Armstrong) & Meela Nais (Patricia Velasquez) the reincarnation of Egyptian princess Anck Su Namun have discovered the remains of the high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who they intend to bring back to life to fight & defeat the reincarnated Scorpion King & take control of his army that will enable them to conquer the earth. However Baltus needs the Bracelt of Anubis to reveal the location of the Scorpion King's pyramid & they will go to any lengths to gain possession of the bracelet which currently Rick & Evelyn have although unknown to them their young son Alex (Freddie Boath) has it on his wrist. Baltus & his gang kidnap Alex & use him to show them the way to the Scorpion King, although Rick, Evelyn, Jonathan (John Hannah) & Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) are hot on their tails to save Alex & the world...<br/><br/>Written & directed by Stephen Sommers The Mummy Returns was the sequel to the smash hit remake of The Mummy (1999) & in my opinion is a slightly better film. The script is all about being bigger, louder & better than the original with one extravagant overblown set-piece after another. The film moves along like a rocket, in fact The Mummy Retrurns has to be one of the fastest paced films I've ever seen, there's barely a scene that goes by where there isn't a special effect, shoot-out, chase, explosion or some sort of action. As a result the character's are pretty shallow & I honestly don't know why Jonathan is back as he does nothing, I think in some ways they're as much of a passenger as we, the viewer, are. The story introduces all sorts of mythical Egyptian cities, legends & monsters & feels very much like an Indiana Jones globe-trotting action packed adventure with a hint of archaeology & horror thrown in there! Although The Mummy Returns is about as far removed from reality as any film can be so don't expect to learn anything, if you know what I mean. The Mummy Returns is big budget over-the-top entertainment that I thought was great fun & had had many enjoyable sequences although it's a little silly & a bit overlong at over two hours.<br/><br/>Director Sommers does a good job, there's plenty of flashy CGI effects & some great action sequences. Everything looks great, the production design is top-notch as are the costumes, locations & period sets. The fights are well choreographed & I rather liked the the Scorpion King monster at the end even if the close-up special effects aren't the best. Not that it matters but if you look at Rachel Weisz's boots she wears throughout the film you'll notice how the heel changes between shots, sometimes she has high heels, then medium & then totally flat soles depending on what she has to do, however I'll cut her some slack as I don't think you could do back-flips in high heels without breaking your ankles...<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $98,000,000 The Mummy Returns is well made & has that big budget Hollywood polish to it. The acting is almost incidental, it's not particularly good from anyone but it'll do. Is it just me or does anyone else think Rachel Weisz looks really hot in this?<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns in my opinion is a great film, it moves along like a rocket & it has some terrific action scenes & special effects. There's plenty of bang for your money here, definitely worth a watch & I reckon it's a highly entertaining film. After proving popular here The Rock got his own spin-off film The Scorpion King (2002) while on the back of The Mummy Returns the animated TV series The Mummy: The Animated Series (2001) was made."

","Mostly a rehash of the original, but this time, there's the Scorpion King (The Rock) to shake things up a bit. I actually saw this movie in Spain, so the one-liners were often hard to translate. But overall, we now know that movies from the 1930's are to be remade in the 1950's-1970's with a sense of camp, and then remade in the 21st century as crosses between David Lean-style epics and Harrison Ford action flicks; not only ""The Mummy"", but also ""King Kong"" comes to mind. But now that Brendan Fraser has starred in a Best Picture winner (""Crash"") and Rachel Weisz has won Best Supporting Actress for ""The Constant Gardener"", I expect no more mummies.<br/><br/>And one more thing: why did the Scorpion King get his own movie? I never saw it but heard that it was just an excuse for buff men to flex their muscles.

While the first Mummy film was mildly fresh and fun in its modern take on old campy stories like this, the second film just rehashes that idea with a slightly different plot that is much more stupid and ridiculous. It is now quite tired, dull, and downright inane, with really very little of value. It goes without saying that there is little or no character development and it relies on cheap, worn-out gags and thrills.

","THE MUMMY was a surprise hit in 1999. It at all of the elements of the great INDIANA JONES films with a lot of originality. Plus the characters were all likable and the dialogue was extremely witty. Now, we are presented with THE MUMMY RETURNS, a highly disappointing sequel that is loud, noisy and impersonal. The movie opens with background information on The Scorpion King. This is handled well and this movie could have been just about him. Then, without ever getting a title credit, we move to Egypt of 1933. We already see our heroes stumbling upon relics that relate to The Scorpion King. They find an artifact and take it with them, but unknowingly start a trap. Needless to say, they escape back to London with their son, who places the artifact on his wrist and has 7 days to find The Scorpion Kings lair before he dies. This is an interesting movie itself, but no, we forgot about The Mummy. Well, an Anck-Su-Namun look-a-like and others try to resurrect The Mummy so that he can kill The Scorpion King and be ""more powerful."" Confused? I sure was. <br/><br/>The plot to THE MUMMY RETURNS is simply a mess. It has too much going on and doesn't stop to let you relate and enjoy the characters. They give you just enough plot to put action sequences around them. The dialogue, while clever at times, is delivered horribly to even attempt to be witty or interesting. Sure, they are saying something but we really don't care, because if it isn't a Mummy soldier chasing them, it is little pigmy skeletons pulling everyone down under the grass similar to the raptor scene in JURASSIC PARK II. The things that made the first one so good (fun characters, good acting) are abandoned for non-stop and numbing action sequences. And on top of that, the movie isn't scary at all. At least the first film had its tense moments. And when the story tries to be tender and serious, you can't help but think, ""It'll be OK."" <br/><br/>The special effects are also a problem. It seems as if the filmmakers want to show the effects to you so quickly that they abandon all tension or horror that the first film tried. You can help but think of the droid army in THE PHANTOM MENANCE when you see the ""dog"" army in the desert. How many times do we need to see a mummy or another creature stretch their mouth open wide? It was done a lot in the first film. Seeing it now didn't make it more interesting. And when we finally see The Scorpion King, we are just so overwhelmed that we just want it to be over. <br/><br/>It was fun seeing the characters again and how they changed. O'Connell didn't change much. He was given some parental instincts, but the script made them seem forced. Evelyn is much more physical than she was before. She isn't afraid to make a fist and fight and some of this leads to her interesting past. Jonathan is back but he is given the worst dialogue, so it makes him look even more idiotic. The rest of the cast does a good job but is given little to do, including The Mummy himself. <br/><br/>I just can't help but feel disappointed and bored with THE MUMMY RETURNS. If they had taken the time to stop and let us enjoy the characters rather than the effects, this could have been a better film."

Lets start with the constant lip lock love affair between Fraser and Weisz.. It was just a little too much. Every 25 minutes these two are engaged in passionate kissing to show their amount of love for each other. How many times did you want to throw your popcorn at the movie screen and scream ""get a room people!""?<br/><br/>I can't stop at just that. How about information that would have been really helpful in the first movie? Brendan Fraser now has a tattoo that we just never saw in the first movie that marks him as a Magi and a protector... Gee... wouldn't that have been useful to know before the Magi raided the camp in The 1st Mummy?<br/><br/>Thought that was it? Wrong! What in god's name is up with the whole balloon scene? I swear that was the same balloon used in Waterworld... and as I recall it wasn't all that reliable in Costners flick either. <br/><br/>How about all the horrible, cheesy, lifeless, laughless one liners flying out of Fraser's mouth? Come on... people. You can't just take a movie.. throw in a high special effects budget and try and build a terrible script around it. Okay you can in Hollywood. For the serious film buffs such as myself... I see right thru all the ignorant dribble seemingly written by two 12 yr old's who ran out of good fart jokes.<br/><br/>How about the Rock? My favorite Wrestler... The People's Scorpion gets all of 5 minutes in the movie... Heck the trailer had more of his face splattered across the screen than the actual movie. See they suckered us into this one. Here we thought we'd see the Rock Bottom and The People's elbow... err... i mean... claw. What do we get? 5 minutes of the Rock killing and eating a scorpion followed by a very sad special effects creation that resembles Graham Greene and a Scorpion. Sad... but true.<br/><br/>Last but definitely never least... the introduction of a child character into the movie. Or as I call it the ""Scrappy-Doo"" effect. Bringing whiz kids that have little to no fear of 1000 yr old walking corpses and giant man scorpions completely defeats the purpose of portraying the villains as truly evil creatures. If the kid isn't afraid... why should the audience be? I don't know about you... but if I were 9 years old and standing toe to toe with a walking talking dead guy... I'd be a tad distraught by the whole ordeal.<br/><br/>The Mummy Returns may have done enough to make back the money spent to create this awful sequel... but in the end... It took away from all the greatness of the original movie. <br/><br/>Bottom Line--> Fraser... Indian Jones you ain't."

Where The Mummy Returns fails, is that it fails to do this.  This is a very silly film trying to be serious and it just doesn't work.  Introducing plot devices whereby Rick OConnell is destined to be the saviour of mankind is just stupid.  Underusing the funniest character in the film(Jonathan) is just stupid.  Making fundamental changes that can't possibly tie in the first film is just stupid.  And that child is just stupid.  <br/><br/>I'm not a kid friendly person to start with.  And whilst he was quite cute, and obviously enthusiastic and not a bad actor, I just didn't like him.  It seemed like a way of getting more kids to like the film really which just annoyed me.<br/><br/>I do actually quite like this film, but given a choice I would rather watch The Mummy.  I like the way Evie evolves as a character, but she is the only one who does - and it's supposed to be set 9 years later.  And how is it that if she's the reincarnation of Nefertiti, Imhotep thought she was Anck-sun-amun in the first film?  I know this film isn't supposed to be taken seriously, but when Sommers expects you to, I feel the need to pull him up.  <br/><br/>The Mummy Returns feels like a sequel that rehashes all the best bits of the first film - all the same plot devices, fight scenes and action sequences. And it fails to deliver the same payload.  And don't even start me on the Rock.  I really looked forward to seeing him in this film, I loved the idea of his character.  And what did I get?  A 2 minute prologue, the rest was a CGI scorpion monster that growled.  Disappointing."

","""The Mummy"" was nice and fun to watch, with the stress on ""fun"" in that the movie didn't take itself seriously at all, and had tendencies of being an action parody. I expected ""The Mummy"" to be a dumb action flick, and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't one. Now, knowing its prequel, I expected ""The Mummy Returns"" to be about as entertainingly funny. Well, I couldn't have been disappointed more. ""The Mummy Returns"" is just dumb. I mean, really dumb. Non-original, non-funny, non-entertainingly dumb. No traces left of the ""action parody"" approach, no traces worth mentioning of a plot, badly written and directed, really bad and most of all noticable CGI at times (while -strangely enough- being rather good at other times). It even fails on a design level in that the ancient egyptian look is totally unrealistic and over-the-top, all in all appearing rather un-egyptian (""The Mummy"" was halfway decent in this regard). ""The Mummy Returns"" tries to be a fully-fledged action flick, but even fails at that. The fighting sequences are lame and badly paced, the effects are silly and misplaced and barely state-of-the-art, even the sound design is awful as it often relies on known audio library effects that one knows just too well. ""The Mummy"" had a proper and fairly convincing feel in terms of showing 1920s people messing with ancient egyptian ghosts. Watching ""The Mummy Returns"" feels wrong throughout its entire length, it appears like 21st century people putting on a bad provincial stageplay or carnival show without really knowing what they're doing or how to do it. If movies are compositions, this one is incredibly badly composed. Don't waste your time or money unless you're expecting nothing, especially not a proper sequel."
"Li-1","Null","0","1","10 December 2003"," The title says it all: it's an expensive rehash that isn't much fun.
","** out of ****<br/><br/>Because of how much I enjoyed the original, I looked forward to the prospect of a sequel to The Mummy; that is, until I noticed the title, The Mummy Returns, which virtually promises this to be a sequel that does little more than rehash its predecessor. Basically, this means the same villains, same setting, somewhat the same story (except bloated exponentially, I'll get back to it later). Damn, I'm starting to appreciate Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom even more. Hell, forget that, TMR makes it even more obvious how great of an adventure movie Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was because that film also took its predecessors basic elements but reworked them into a fresh, cohesive, and smashingly entertaining joyride. As for The Mummy Returns.ugh.<br/><br/>Set in 1933 (eight years after the original), Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz reprise their roles as Rick and Evelyn O'Connell. They're apparently super-rich, judging from the luxurious British mansion they live in, so they must have cashed in on all that treasure they inadvertently brought back with them in the final scenes of the original. The couple also have a young son, Alex (Freddie Boath), who's probably more mature than his Uncle Jonathan (John Hannah).<br/><br/>Rick and Evelyn's latest `excavation' in Egypt uncovers an artifact that curious Alex clasps to his arm, revealing the location to.gah, damned if I know, suffice to say that Imhotep the mummy will be revived and there's lots of talk of reincarnation, prophecies, saving the world, and big scorpion kings that half look like a WWF wrestler.<br/><br/>Therein lies the movie's problem, the messy story, which might have seemed reasonably passable in preconception stages but comes across as totally confusing and confused on-screen. Director Stephen Sommers isn't a master storyteller, but his work in The Mummy clearly shows he has a love of escapist filmmaking and crafted the plot in a simplistic but engrossing enough manner that it didn't get in the way of the characters, the action, or the adventure. He obviously didn't learn his lesson.<br/><br/>I'm actually a pretty big fan of the man's work, but this is easily his biggest misfire since The Adventures of Huck Finn. The Mummy Returns is just turgid filmmaking in almost every aspect of its production. Only the likeable cast and the general fact that Sommers is better at delivering pure spectacle than say, the likes of Michael Bay, Joel Schumacher, and Roland Emmerich keep this film generally watchable.<br/><br/>But didn't Sommers realize that what would have made this second go-round far more invigorating would have been to place our already beloved characters into a totally different environment with new dangers and villains? He seems perfectly content recycling virtually every aspect of the original film, and then geometrically bloating every little detail into something bigger, which appears to have been the key word going through his mind.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is bigger than the original. There's more action and it's larger in scale; there are more badguys, more special effects, more flashbacks, more Magi, and more prophecies, all this without the much-needed freshness or the rousing sense of adventure.<br/><br/>Whenever Sommers gets into a bit of a speed bump in the plot, he simply explains it away with prophecies and reincarnations. Rick O'Connell himself is a bad-ass adventurer, making him into a prophesied warrior destined to save the world puts a bad taste in my mouth. Couldn't they have just kept him a rugged, hunky hero without the mystical crap? Same goes for Evelyn, who as it turns out, is the reincarnation of a murdered pharaoh's daughter, conveniently the same pharaoh killed by Imhotep (why he didn't recognize her in the original is beyond me.oh, wait, that's right, Sommers just made this B.S. up for the sequel). The reincarnation bit does little for the character other than explain why she can suddenly fight so well with sais; why was it included again?  At one point after the hour-and-a-half mark, Sommers knocks off one of the main characters in a scene that would have been genuinely affecting if this same character hadn't been revived by an ancient Egyptian ritual ten minutes later.<br/><br/>Cliffhangers can be a lot of fun, but when they're resolved the way they are here, it's like someone's intentionally slapping you in the face. At one point, O'Connell, who's carrying his son in his arms, actually outruns the sunrise. In one of the climactic battles, there are not one, but two instances where characters grab spears that have already been thrown mid-air and one of those moments is shot in Matrix-style slow motion!<br/><br/>And thus we segue into the action, which should be the movie's selling point, but is instead a good part of what holds the film back. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any adventure movie so intent on piling on one action scene after another, so much that it becomes a bit of a headache after awhile. I should be in action movie heaven, but Sommers' occasional miscalculated direction makes a lot of the fights and chases pretty boring. The slow motion I've already covered, but a couple of the fights and chases boast too many quick cuts, nothing as extreme as a Jerry Bruckheimer production, but too distracting to make the action genuinely exciting.<br/><br/>You remember how in The Mummy, it was damn cool and exciting to see what sort of havoc Imhotep could reek? To find out what cool power he would use next? All he does here is repeat what he'd already accomplished in the first go-round, he `telepathically' lifts people off the ground and tosses them around and instead of making a giant sandstorm, he makes a giant wall of water. Yawn. As far as new villains go, Velazquez's Anck Su Namun is hot, but where the hell was her reincarnated self in the previous movie? The Anubis warriors are pathetically useless and The Scorpion King is just a terrible visual conception.<br/><br/>But much as I wish I could hate the movie, I just can't. The cast is just too damned adorable. O'Connell is no Indiana Jones, but he's about as cool and fun a substitute as you can get. Fraser is obviously having a ball in the role, even if he has put on a slight bit of unflattering weight. Rachel Weisz's Evelyn is the best Indiana Jones girl Indy never had. Hell, forget that, she could kick all the Indy girls' asses in a three-on-one match and still come out looking as pretty as ever. Evelyn's my kind of woman: tough, intelligent, beautiful, with all these great qualities wrapped around a warm, caring heart. I think I'm in love.<br/><br/>John Hannah is, unfortunately, not as funny as he was before; like the movie itself, his humor's lost its sense of freshness, but he's still a bit amusing and certainly still a charming, greedy doofus. But then there's that crucial casting error, Freddie Boath as little Alex. Kids in action movies tend to be the purveyor that destroys tension and excitement. As a matter of fact, the only kid sidekick I've ever liked was Short Round from Temple of Doom and let me tell you something, Alex sure as hell is no Short Round. He's funny in spurts, but ultimately just not a charming or talented enough actor to pull the role off.<br/><br/>A good cast can do a lot for a film, much like what Fraser and Wiesz do here, but while they make The Mummy Returns ultimately a middling experience, it's a little sad to see such fun characters that don't get the movie they deserve."

","(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) From the guy who brought you the original! The original was great right? Right! The sequel should be better, right? Hell, no!! Stephen Sommers, writer and director of the 1999 hit, THE MUMMY brings us THE MUMMY RETURNS, one of the biggest action adventures ever made! Now, let's start by saying that I like this movie. The plot is good. The story is good. Everything is fine! There are a few corny performances, but other than that, everything is good. Except that Sommers did not know how to handle this concept.<br/><br/>He got too damn anxious to put a sequel out so he could make more money, that he didn't care what he wrote down for a script. So, no less than five minutes into the movie, the action starts. Then about ten minutes later it stops for about another five minutes and then the action starts again and doesn't stop for the rest of the movie! The action never stops! No one takes a breather, no one even has time to take a leak! There is just so much action, that it eventually becomes boring. Sommers just kept on writing down action. He also started the story in the middle. What did he do? Lose the first five pages of the script? Because the movie starts with the previous film's stars Brendan Fraser and Rachael Weisz in a temple somewhere. Then these guys come along with no notion as to who sent them. Then after that scene is over a couple minutes later, we get to this dig site where people are finding Imhotep's body (with no explanation as to why) and the person behind all of this is Anck-Su-Namn (some Egyptian woman from the first movie who was dead) and there is not explanation as to why she is alive!! Doesn't this seem odd to anyone? <br/><br/>Well, anyway I'm done complaining. If you don't like this movie, don't say I didn't warn you!<br/><br/>THE MUMMY RETURNS gets 2/5."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** The first mummy movie from '99 was on tv the other day and I watched part of it. I thought the story was great, and they showed mummies realistically without being too fake (especially the scene where they first open up the coffin) and even though I was a lil unsure on the beginning story, I read the original script for that opening sequence on the net and it explained it much better for me (because the movie version leaves out a lot of it, such as them stealing that egyptians chicks body which was already mummified, and her heart beating for the two seconds she comes to life.<br/><br/>nehow, tonite I decided I would treat myself to some loser fun (ie getting me a movie) so I got both the mummy and the mummy returns. I thoroughly enjoyed the mummy as I said before because u could believe it could happen (although very farfetched, still sort of believable, such as throwing in the ten plagues, that was a stroke of genius).<br/><br/>I was very disappointed with the mummy returns for a billion reasons. okay, a) that egyptian girlfriend chick was nowhere near as hot as she was in the first one! (kidding, she actually wasnt, but that wouldnt ruin me a movie). a(for real)) where the hell did she come from?? I mean, there she is, overseeing a digging site, and I'm like what?? ummm, wasnt she killed in the last one? How did she come to life?? also, someone else mentioned that this movie was a parody of the first, I couldnt agree more. It started off promising enough, with the archaeology and even her flashback, which was tres cool (I love the ancient egypt flashbacks in both movies). However, having Evelyn (the gf/wife) remembering from her past life?? I mean, corny beyond belief! the son was pretty cool, smart lil kid. I liked Evelyns brother. He was great in both movies. *SORT OF SPOILER WARNING* that scene where Egyptian girl stabs and kills Evelyn, that sucked. I mean, I seriously did not see the point in that, it took the plot nowhere. *End of spoiler* Having the rock as scorpion king was cool, but the computer animated stuff sucked!! I did laugh aloud and even rewound the part where his computer image gives the eyebrow thingie. The mummy in this one sucked. He was so serious and stuff, seemed more like a general or sumthin than sum1 that actually fights. In the first one, he was fighting and he was one creepy SOB. I mean, he pulled out a guys eyes and tongue and used them himself. That was great. And he was this cool invincible guy. In this one, he walks around and makes big tidal waves (total ripoff of the first one) and then when the BIG fight comes around, hes mortal again. I mean, at least in the first one, it took a huge struggle to make him mortal, in this one, it just happened. SUcked!! Also, that airship thingie??? gimme a break. The first one was very realistic, ie, it looked like it could take place in Egypt in 1926. This one looked like it took place in sum parallel universe like earth, but not it at all. Do NOT see this movie unless sum1 else got it and u really have nuthin better to do, complete waste of time. Oh yeah, I have to agree with sum other posts from here that Evelyn is one of the hottest women I have ever seen. nehow, thats my rant. enjoy!"

","A lot of people have been using the words ""cartoony"" and ""video game"" to describe this one, and let me assure you that's accurate.  (I'm halfway considering renting the video game-- maybe that's where the movie's hiding..?)  ""The Mummy Returns"" is blah from the very first scenes, where we are introduced to an impossible plot and a lot of  unexplained and poorly rendered computer generated characters, the forerunners of many more to come in this FX jaunt that isn't even half as good as its predecessor.   Even The Mummy *himself* isn't nearly as interesting as he was, because he looks more like a walking ""Visible Man"" educational toy than the creepy, shredded corpse he was in the first film.  He is given all kinds of cartoony expression and doesn't look all that scary, especially because he acts downright civilized, having serious, ""Let's conference"" discussions with the slew of additional bad guys this movie offers up in an attempt to cover for the wayward story.  <br/><br/>Now, this is a *Mummy* film, so you're going to have to check your sense of reality at the door, but not in the fun, fantastic way you did with the first movie.  This one is so implausible it actually gets BORING for being so unengaging, and only gets worse as it wears on.  They keep throwing more ridiculous stuff at you every ten minutes or so, building up (I guess...?) to some of the worst computer effects you've ever seen, including a rendering of The Rock as a giant scorpion creature that really does look like it just scurried out of a video game. Gone is the gradual buildup and even the ""faux reality"" that 'The Mummy' had, and the characters are too busy being parodies of themselves to be any fun to watch.  Worst of all is that they seem to be *aware* of the parody, and so don't take the action seriously.  This one just goes WAY over the top, and even gets quite predictable toward the end.  In summary:<br/><br/>1. Arnold Vosloo is way sexier than The Rock, (aka Mr. No-Fillings, Mr. Whiter-Than-White-Teeth..  And how?  Flouride wasn't even discovered until the 1900s.)<br/><br/>2. Oded Fehr's character is probably the most engaging of the entire cast, probably for being the least overdone.<br/><br/>3. Rachel Weisz isn't half as cute as she was in the first one.  Too skinny, maybe?  <br/><br/>4. That kid gets on your nerves.<br/><br/>5.  This is an awful movie.  I would suggest avoiding it. <br/><br/>

Listen to the score at that point because I swore to God at that point that I couldn't handle anymore excitement. But it kept coming. And coming. Until I started to get annoyed.

","Mindless rubbish--that's how another IMBD reader referred to this sequel--and that's pretty accurate.  The fact that it was one of Hollywood's designated ""big"" movies for 2001, grossing over $200 million, is not surprising.  After all the Brendan Fraser heroics worked well in the first ""Mummy"" picture, only slightly less ridiculous than this one.<br/><br/>What you've got here appears to be the successor to the ""Indiana Jones"" series of constant cliffhangers, live-action cartoons that chew up characters with abandon.  While extras die like flies, the audience apparently doesn't care that every bullet, sword and scimitar leveled at our heroes (a total of six people in this one) is guaranteed to miss and that every unbelievable scene is one-upped by the one following it. When one of those blades actually finds its mark and a major character dies --not to worry--the death doesn't take and she comes back.  Surprise!<br/><br/>The sequel trades on the fact that we're already familiar with the Mummy, who's come a long way since his shuffling Boris Karloff days.  This Imenhotep is a savage superfiend, part Spiderman and part Freddie Krueger, apparently with only one weakness--he just can't snuff out Fraser or any of the other members of his cinematic family.  And, oh yes, there's a kid in this one who exudes as much charm as the insufferable brat brought to ""Star Wars--Phantom."" <br/><br/>But this seems directly aimed at the younger set and has video game written all over it.  You've got some mini-mummies who come flying out of the tall grass a la the ""jurassic"" raptors and a scorpion king with the head of a Rock.<br/><br/>Without Fraser's breezy style, the whole thing would collapse but the producers don't appear too concerned with dramatic license.  There's nothing unusual about Hollywood heroes overcoming ridiculous odds but whether it's James Bond, Arnold or Jackie Chan, the secret for success is to concoct a plot that allows for the suspension of reality.<br/><br/>Yet the ""Mummy"" team just piles up the special effects and trots off laughing--all the way to the bank.<br/><br/>I gave this thing a ""3"" only because it might do something to encourage further study of ancient Egypt."

""The Mummy Returns"" retains the comedy/action/adventure flavour and features all the same characters. However it features one new, unwelcome, addition - the Kid. Kids can destroy a movie and are rarely welcome as they tend to get kidnapped, and cause havoc without doing anything constructive (but certainly destructive). The kid here - Alex (Freddie Boath) - is more tolerable than most but he still adds nothing to the movie, and grated on my nerves. And he got kidnapped. How. Unsurprising.<br/><br/>The script is more stupid than the original, and has less of the tongue-in-cheek humour to it. Having said that there's enough there to entertain - plenty of action, again enhanced by (mostly) decent SFX. It looks and plays out fairly well.<br/><br/>Sequels to block busters are generally poor cash-ins. This is a cash-in, but isn't that poor, relative to the original.

His goal this time around is to eliminate a fierce ancient warrior known as the Scorpion King, thus granting him control over the dreaded Army of Anubis. Opens with a bang as the introductory action set pieces take you on an over-the-top roller coaster ride, but it quickly loses steam as the rest of the film is desperately padded-out with a flimsy plot, cheesy dialogue, forced humor, and loud, redundant action on its way to an obvious finale.

","I have to say that I really like the first installment of The Mummy. It was so good that it, along with future sequals, could have easily taken up ranks of a new classic with the Indiana Jones series. So knowing this, I was very excited to see this movie. All the way into the theater I was excited by what would happen, and even through a good part of the film I was really liking it. It wasn't as good as the first, but what movie ever is? And I was even willing to accept the WRESTLER (not ACTOR) The Rock in the movie. Note: I am not one for accepting wrestlers in movies, sure they are both entertainment, but one all around sucks (wrestling) and one doesn't (movies). As I have noted to friends before, A wrestler in a movie is equal to a dog and a monkey having a baby. It isn't a good thing even from the start. But then it happened: The team of adventurers went and got into a big (extra fake and cheesy) hot air balloon. Yes that's right kids, they opt out on any logical means of travel for their time period and they get a (extra fake and cheesy) hot air balloon. Ever after I watched the film and only hoped it couldn't get any more unbelieveable. And yet it did! Yes thats right kids, it got worse. The Scorpion King shares his wrath with the audience, not that he is in any way scary it is just that he is so stinking cruddy (Badly computer animated, and even worse as a major bad guy!) Is what I am getting at is that it wasn't the wrestler that made it bad in the end (not that it helped), it was the overly done special effects. The difference between this movie, and the GREAT and AWESOME original is that the original was enhanced by special effects, the face in the sand, the plagues on the cities, even the  computer animated mummies were an addition, and an enhancement, to the already good story and acting. On the contrary in this movie, rather than going with the good characters that were already developed and just adding another plot like Indiana Jones, someone changed the entire theme of the movie from the original and made it special effects. And that doesn't constitute a sequal at all.<br/><br/>If you liked The Mummy, don't see The Mummy Returns, it will just spoil the first film, and leave a bad (I just got ripped off 8 bucks) taste in your mouth!"

This time they have their ingenious son with them. After some trouble, they get home to London, but they´ve brought something with them that they shouldn´t have taken.

Because there are lots of those here. Too many, I would say. Sure, they are great to look at (except for one certain effect towards the end, shame on you ILM), and helps the movie to keep the pace up. But it feels like Stephen Sommers should have trusted more on his actors, and less on the effects. <br/><br/>The film has its moments, the Scorpion King not being one, and the fun rarely stops. The actors do a good job with the material they have, and it´s nice to see the beautiful actress Patricia Velasquez in a bigger role this time around.

","While not quite up to the original Brendan Fraser flick that started it all, 'The Mummy Returns' delivers all the action, adventure and romance one could expect from a story of this sort--and then some.  My only problem with the picture is the action is so non-stop, it hardly gives you a chance to enjoy the beautiful sets and scenery. Something is happening every moment--in itself not a bad thing--but there's seldom a pause for breath or a sequence that doesn't involve heavy use of FX.  <br/><br/>As for the participants, Brendan Fraser resumes his original role looking just a tad bit heavier, Rachel Weisz makes a lovely action-adventure heroine, and John Hannah and Fred Boath have some crackling good lines to deliver, giving the much needed humorous slant to all of the proceedings--not that anyone is going to take the story seriously.<br/><br/>Again, if you enjoyed 'The Mummy', you'll enjoy this one. Some of the scenes are gorgeously staged--the dirigible looks like a floating gondola in the sky, zooming past mountains and pyramids--and the desert sands are real enough to supply all the exotic flavor needed. And some of the creatures dreamed up by those Industrial Light people are really awesome.<br/><br/>Summing up: never a dull moment thanks to some dazzling use of special effects.

It doesn't happen often that I don't even finish watching a movie, but this was just too bad...no fun, no excitement, no tention and no beautiful settings like we've been spoiled with in Indy films.<br/><br/>It started all in the very first scene, where this 'Scorpion Warrior' is played by one of the most pathetic actors I've ever seen in such an expensive movie....he's just not convincing....it's just a wrestler or something that is just too idiotic to act a guy that's angry, or almost dying. The moment when he's the only one left in the desert, and falls to the ground from exhaustian is just an insult to any similar film ever made. What a disgrace!<br/><br/>And it just goes on like that, although the main actors are very good...not a bad word about them.<br/><br/>The scenes that have computer generated backgrounds (so that the actors are playing in front of a blue/green screen) are just as terrible and unfinished looking as in Star Wars Episode I.....when you make something like that you have to be carefull that the light, contrast and colors in your background are the same as in the part where the actors play. It's ofcourse not easy to do these things, but if you're not too experienced don't overdo stuff.<br/><br/>The result is that the studio sets are very small and cheap looking, which doesn't give you the idea that they are really there.<br/><br/>The film gets even worse because of the childish humour and story, but most of all the directing just completely fails. The guy who directed it doesn't seem to be any good at telling stories....there's no build up to anything, and characters just 'pop' onto the screen....Why do we see a detailed story of 'the mummy' and then suddenly find our 'heroes' in the middle of a quest already ??<br/><br/>This film makes all the Indy movies look ever better....I always thought it was a great idea to find him in the middle of a meaningless quest, after which he returns home and then the real story begins...but with a slow build up.<br/><br/>No, the scene where they were driving that buss in London almost made it look like it was a parody on Indy.....it could have been done by Mell Brooks.<br/><br/>Okay, even a badly made movie can be okay to waste a few hours on a rainy day, but it just wasn't fun."

Granted, there's plenty of action but the SFX really take most of it away, bar the battle scenes. Did anyone else not think that the SFX weren't even that great? It was so toy-storyish that it didn't really fit in...for example, THAT blimp, those little killer munchkins and the computer-generated face of the rock - what the hell was that all about?

It's also amazing how the first film centred around on how difficult it was to ressurrect the original mummy, yet in this one it is like an every day procedure.<br/><br/>This is Hollywood at its best: SFX heavy and a predictable, cheesy plot - and this Cheese has gone off a long time ago.

","I found the first ""Mummy"" film to be rather a guilty pleasure. We were introduced to some fun and interesting characters, there was some snappy dialogue, and the effects were kind of nifty. It wasn't a great film, by a long stretch, and it certainly didn't give Brendan Fraser an opportunity to flash his considerable acting chops, but it was good summer fun.<br/><br/>How disappointing to discover the sequel to be no pleasure at all, guilty or otherwise. The characters were cardboard cut-outs -- writer/director Sommers doesn't even bother to reintroduce us to any of them, much less develop them in any way at all, as if he didn't expect us to care about them; the dialogue makes ""wooden"" seem like an accolade; and the effects were so obviously computer-generated that they just looked cheesy. The point, I would think, of CGI is that the eye is fooled into believing that there is a desert plain filled with warriors, not into recognizing that there are about 100 actors in the foreground, and a teeming mass of pixels behind them.<br/><br/>Worse, the money saved on box-top visuals wasn't spent on screenwriters or editors. The scenes are jump-cut out of all comprehension, and the dialogue seems to serve only for something to put on the soundtrack to break the stretches of John Williams-knockoffs. The director doesn't bother to pace the action, to build up from valleys into heights, most likely because he fears that slowing down at all would tip off the audience that there is no there there. Rarely does the viewer find any cause or effect between the characters' words and actions. When the hero's son is captured, the mother briefly grieves and the father sets his jaw, but one senses they do this because that's what parents are supposed to do, not because they are feeling the potential loss of their only child<br/><br/>Until I saw The Mummy Returns, I believed the worst film I had ever seen was George Clooney's zombie-state-inducing ""Batman and Robin."" I thought I would never see its like in terms of plot-deprivation, dialogic inanity, and gratuitous special effects.

Although the script offers chances of ambiguity, it destroys them immediately by a childish black and white philosophy. Regarding its costs, some of the effects aren't very convincing - like the scorpion king, who looks like a character from a video game - Ray Harryhausen made stuff like that more chilling forty years ago.

This along with a ""smart beyond his years"" kid are two of the three changes from the original.  Still no story line to follow.  Just an incredible succession of special effects.  The early scenes with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, gave a flicker of hope for a real story; however, his screen time was disappointingly brief.  That is, except for the animated mess at the end.  You will not be able to stop shaking your head at his return.  Hopefully this was meant as a big joke by our ""director"".  Arnold Vosloo is the only one to put forth any acting effort, but the weak script prevents us from seeing what he's made of. Unless you have a high dollar home theatre, this will be a flop on video. Won't someone please cast Brendan Fraser in a daytime soap, so that we may be spared his moviemaking for a few years?"

","THE MUMMY RETURNS is so much better and entertaining than the first 'MUMMY' movie was when it came out in May of 1999. In only two years the special effects have gotten so great that you can't tell what's real and what is not real. The special effects in THE MUMMY are nothing compared to the ones in THE MUMMY RETURNS. The special effects are not the only thing better in THE MUMMY RETURNS. There are better action sequences and a better relationship between Rick and Evelyn. They are married in this one with a young boy named Alex. Alex gives the movie a few laughs, a scene of slapstick, and a sub-plot about him being kidnapped. This sub-plot makes THE MUMMY RETURNS a little longer than it needs to be or should be. The only real complaint I have about THE MUMMY RETURNS is that the director [Stephen Sommers] needs to learn how to trim a movie down."

","This was a glorified Saturday morning tv cartoon with all the CGI and Hollywood trimmings.Not really for adults but definitely for kids.Only one real classic scene sequence and that involves the very exciting,double decker London bus chase.But everything goes down hill after that as the action becomes too blurry and overwhelming.The CGI quality also rapidly deteriorates as the movie moves along which was probably due to production time and budgetary constraints.The lead actors gave it a great effort but the little boy would not really win over much wiser movie goers.The Rock was great and it was too bad he only had very few scenes.Although this was a good trial run for him to be another top notch action star for future films.Worth your money if you still like Saturday morning cartoons.But this is definitely a winner for most kids...."
