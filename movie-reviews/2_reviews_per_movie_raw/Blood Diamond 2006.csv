"john_cberry","10","892","1010","4 December 2006"," A Hollywood movies tells an African story full of death and violence and presents it with impressive truth.
","Because I lived in Sierra Leone, in fact in Kono, the diamond-mining area of the country, for three years, I had to see Blood Diamond as soon as it came out. It is an excellent movie. Although it was not filmed in Sierra Leone, it captures the reality of the country to a remarkable degree. There is a great deal of violence in this movie, but that violence is organic, realistic, fitting to what happened there. They even manage to convey the fact that the people are as astonished by this violence as we are; Sierra Leone used to be one of the safest countries in the world. The movie tells the facts about conflict diamonds quickly and accurately. DiCaprio's performance is impressive, certainly the best by him I've ever seen: he is totally believable as a white African. Jennifer Connelly's role is much smaller but she makes the most of it. Djiman Housou has enormous physical presence as the brave Mende fisherman. This movie just gets so many things right that the few places it departs from reality are entirely forgivable. I would heartily recommend this movie to everyone; it is the best Hollywood movie I've seen in years."
"A_Roode","9","389","455","10 December 2006"," A great character film with two excellent performances.
","Since there is very little in the negative column, let me disperse with it first: 'Blood Diamond' might fairly be accused of 'bleeding heart syndrome' (more on that in a bit), has a few minor pacing issues and seems unsure with how to end. The ending that they chose extends the film too far, seems forced and is tacked on. The more natural ending is on the mountainside -- you'll know what I mean when you see it. Those things said, the positives are much greater and this film showcased two towering performances. Djimon Hounsou is nothing short of incredible and I'd be astonished if he isn't considered at Oscar time. Secondly, although I've had little patience for him before, Leonardo DiCaprio has really impressed me this year. With his performances in 'The Departed' and now 'Blood Diamond,' I think I need to reappraise my own biases against him. I'm becoming a fan.<br/><br/>Some of the early reviews that I read painted 'Blood Diamond' as hysterical left-winger cause-head paradise. They suggest that the conflict diamond situation has been exaggerated and completely distorted. I don't know if that is the case. The film makes a compelling case but I don't base my political and economic decisions on films that I watch. My interest here was to see how characters would respond to adversity and a terrible, horrifyingly dark situation. The political agenda of the film isn't as cloyingly bombastic as I was afraid it might be. This is a film that, while concerned with the political situation in Africa, focuses more on how the obsessive search for a large, rare pink diamond consumes those who get too close to it.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is excellent as a Rhodesian (HIS description) mercenary and arms dealer working in Sierra Leone. Hounsou is a fisherman who gets drawn into the civil war raging around him and discovers a pink diamond that could save -- or destroy -- both he and his family. Jennifer Connelly plays a journalist trying to discover if a huge multi-national diamond company is knowingly in the market for conflict diamonds. Jennifer Connelly seems to get the worst of the dialogue. When told that Americans are in part to blame for conflict diamonds she responds with a line about 'not all girls want a fantasy wedding.' It makes her look naive at best and silly at worst. She generally manages to save the character from either of those fates though and also manages to avoid self-righteousness when dealing with some of the films more morally flexible characters. Hounsou is great and the desperation in his character as he tries to find his family crackles on the screen. He is cagey and understands what he needs to do to survive. His character is not above playing servile if that will keep him alive. And when provoked to violence, the result was absolutely chilling. In much smaller roles are Arnold Vosloo as a mercenary Colonel, Stephen Collins as a diplomat and Michael Sheen as an executive at a diamond company. Excellent performances all around.<br/><br/>Is 'Blood Diamond' judgemental? I think that is the wrong question. The film is a character study both of all the men pursuing the pink diamond and what effect it has on them, but it is also a character study of Africa. Tragic and heartsick, 'Blood Diamond' is drenched with cynicism and defeatism. Why is there misery and exploitation? ""TIA,"" explains DiCaprio to Connelly, ""This Is Africa."" In contrast to a film like 'Traffic,' 'Blood Diamond' doesn't wallow in hopelessness. Some of the characters might be cynical but the film itself does search for hope. The heart of the picture is the human cost. Characters see the wealth of the diamond and are destroyed by it. The film shares a great deal thematically with a film like 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre.' High praise for a high quality film."
"Margie24","8","419","515","3 December 2006"," Another Oscar worthy turn from DiCaprio
","Leonardo DiCaprio has become one of the premiere American actors. With a set of natural instincts that lends a non-showy, believable quality to all of his performances, versatility, and movie star size charisma that fills up the screen and emotionally hooks the viewer into his character and story, it is hard to think of another male American actor (with the exception of Johnny Depp) who is consistently giving an audience its money worth; these two gentleman have taken the reins from Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, as those two Oscar-winning future legends of the silver screen gracefully age into more mature roles.<br/><br/>In Blood Diamond, it is Mr. DiCaprio's performance that raises this film above it's standard Hollywood fare of a script (although it is a solid script) into something memorable. His performance here as an opportunistic diamond smuggler equals that of the one he gave earlier in the fall as ""Billy Costigan"" in The Departed, although the two characters couldn't be more different from each other. It may be his best performance yet, and in terms of sheer charisma and memorability it certainly rivals his mega-star making performance as ""Jack Dawson"" in Titanic. <br/><br/>I liked Blood Diamond a great deal, but do not think it is a great film. A good movie? Yes. Very mainstream and formulaic, but it is raised up quite a bit by DiCaprio's character and his terrific realization of it. If I had read this script beforehand, I never would have thought of Leo for this role- possibly George Clooney or some other star known for ""roguish charm,"" but not Leo. But now, having seen it, I can't imagine anybody else as ""Danny Archer;"" it is a fully realized, winning performance.<br/><br/>Mr. Hounsou was wonderful as well, and I liked the chemistry between the two men in their scenes together. He was able to make the audience feel the gamut of emotions his character experiences during the course of the movie- pride and hope, fear, outrage, resignation, mistrust, desperation, and determination, and beautifully rises above the somewhat limiting way his role was written.<br/><br/>I thought Ms. Connelly did as good a job as possible in her role as ""the idealistic journalist who wants to make a difference."" Her part was just a larger version of Joaquin Phoenix's in Hotel Rwanda. As always, I find she brings a certain dignity and intelligence to her performances and does not allow her incredible beauty to overshadow her acting. I thought she and Leo worked wonderfully together, as well, and along with Mr. Hounsou they make an engaging trio you can't help rooting for.<br/><br/>In comparing it to other recent films about Africa, I didn't think this was quite as good as as Hotel Rwanda, but better than The Interpreter, The Constant Gardener, and The Last King of Scotland. I felt an emotional engagement with the characters I didn't experience in the latter three films. I found the script allowed my care for the characters to grow as the story progressed, and was not overly manipulative. At times it veered too much into standard action movie territory, with much violence and many ""close calls"" but would then be brought back into the realm of compelling human drama by a wonderfully acted, intimate scene.<br/><br/>After reading some early negative comments, I was pleasantly surprised at my response to it. Compelling characters and the skillful use of a truly gripping global issue as the plot line make this a satisfying viewing experience- one that I would happily see again."

"ccrivelli2005","8","176","228","28 January 2007"," Diamonds, Nerve And Indifference
","The torturous road of South African diamonds to the greedy fingers of an indifferent world makes this new Edward Zwick movie one of the most powerful Action/Adventure/Dramas to come out of Hollywood in a long time. The perfect balance between entertainment and a thoughtful social commentary helps the center of the story to have a real heart and a palpable respect for us, the audience. All this praise and I still have not mentioned Leonardo Di Caprio or Djimon Hounsou but I'm going to. Di Caprio opens a new door, introducing us to a character who is a first in his already extraordinary career. He startled us as a very young man with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" before he fell with a serious case of Titanictis. Now, after a three a long and serious Scorsese cures, this spectacular actor makes me believe that we haven't seen anything yet. Remarkable. As remarkable as the soulful Djimon Hounsou who manages to give the film a visible soul. I was moved and yes, I must admit, surprised. Apart from the visual and interpretative prowess of ""Blood Diamond"" there is a realistic view of a third world country as shattering as the unforgettable one in ""City Of God"" Don't miss it."

"forindcine","8","160","223","9 December 2006"," Another fine piece by director Edward Zwick
","A few years back I had the pleasure of visiting Antwerp, Belgium, a place many deem ""the diamond capital of the world."" Never before or since have I been in a location where I was surrounded by so much ""bling"". Storefronts had so many diamonds on display you would think they should be better kept in some European version of Fort Knox.<br/><br/>The film Blood Diamond puts an entirely new spin on Antwerp, the diamond industry and that pricey stone you might be wearing around your neck, on your ring finger, or in your ears (mine are cubic-Zs). Set in the West African country of Sierra Leone during the 1990s, this historical-adventure-drama covers a time when the country was in turmoil. Warlords, smugglers and the diamond syndicate all play roles in a refugee exodus, and the killing and enslaving of men to work the diamond fields. The title refers to diamonds which are harvested, smuggled and traded to finance the purchase of weapons used in Civil War.<br/><br/>Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) stars as a fisherman who has his family torn apart and instead of being killed, is sent to work mining diamonds where he finds and hides a large stone. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) a former mercenary, diamond-smuggler, middleman, you-name-it, is looking to score with that stone and exit the business for good. Writer Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is tired of writing shallow stories about less than newsworthy events; she is looking for information about major players in the diamond trade. They all come together in a fast paced, adventure packed piece of film-making that is brutal at times but never boring. The film has a pleasant, unanticipated ending, something hard to pull off in a film of this kind.<br/><br/>Director/Producer Edward Zwick is probably the best in Hollywood at taking a big budget feature film with a historical theme and carefully relay a message without lecturing his audience. His earlier works include a story of the first all-black U.S. Civil War company in ""Glory"" a film, which resulted in Denzel Washington winning his first Oscar. Zwick takes credit for works like The Last Samurai, Shakespeare in Love, Traffic and Courage Under Fire. He is second to no one when it comes to balancing a historical event with action-drama entertainment. Edward Zwick is one of few L.A. directors who still works within the Hollywood establishment yet is able to put out good quality film. <br/><br/>Check out Blood Diamond, your ""bling"" may never look the same again."
"forhall","10","257","368","8 December 2006"," Faithful to the Sierra Leone civil war, but just a small part of it, like Hotel Rwanda
","I rate this a ten because I had the privilege of going to Sierra Leone after the war and participate in one of the war crimes trials there at the Special Court for Sierra Leone, created by the Sierra Leone government with the United Nations. <br/><br/>In a bit more than two and a half hours, the writers and directors have to tell the story of the civil war, keep it concise yet true, and tell it through the eyes of a few participants. Because the story line is so true, and the acting, writing, directing, locations, people, and photography are all superior, I must admit prejudice toward such a high rating. My local reviewer gave it a B+.<br/><br/>My exposure to the civil war and only some of the events of this movie were based on reading books, hundreds of witness statements, online material about the war, including the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Report, and listening to over 100 witnesses testify, and my trial was not even those of the RUF and AFRC, the really bad actors of the war, as the movie shows, pulling no punches. The accounts of atrocities are shockingly real. Tens of thousands had hands amputated, people were indiscriminately murdered, women raped or forced to marry, villages were burned, and children were kidnapped and forced to fight the war for both of the rebel factions (RUF and AFRC). Making a child a soldier is a war crime, and this movie artfully shows you why, without saying a word about it.<br/><br/>Sherman said, about our own Civil War, that ""War is hell."" But, African civil war is far different and atrocious because it inevitably leads to atrocities. <br/><br/>This fine work, with Hotel Rwanda, stands out as a film seriously attempting to explain the atrocities that Africans somehow can do to themselves."
"kosta-pap","7","28","35","20 March 2007"," Great effort, great message, too much Hollywood
","Blood Diamond is an excellent example of how Hollywood formulas can suck the essence out of a unique work of art. The film is exceptionally well done, with great performances, well-written characters, good research and, above all, shocking messages. To all those reviewers who thought it wasn't ""interesting"": Are you kidding me? Three of the most horrible tragedies of our times are shown in the film: - Africa's child-warriors - Militia-led smuggling supporting brutal civil wars and exploiting ancient hatred - The diamond monopoly and its ruthlessness. And the film shows how these are intertwined! If this doesn't touch you, I don't know what will. <br/><br/>But perhaps here lies the film's greatest fault. As other reviewers have eloquently mentioned, it apparently thinks it HAS to use Hollywood formulas in order to get the point across to a wide audience: so we have superstars, a romantic subplot, a cheesy ending, lots of action. And this, combined with the heavy messages of the plot, is just too much. It is no coincidence that so many reviewers used words such as ""odd"" and ""confusing"". They didn't mean they didn't follow the film, they just didn't know why it was going there (and back and forth again). Which was my feeling exactly. It's like listening to a beautiful song with great lyrics, and just as the text is about to grasp you, a cheesy sax-solo rises. <br/><br/>The film had too many sax-solos for its worth. It touched extremely important issues, but didn't have the guts to look the audience in the eye and scream out: ""Are you finally listening? Look around you!"" The Hollywood gutlessness is best shown in the final comments: They do explicitly mention the diamond industry's exploits, but then they advise the audience to ""demand diamonds from peaceful areas"". What? After having shown that the industry holds prices ridiculously high by convincing everyone that diamonds are valuable as such and oh so rare? And that you just NEED to buy or have diamonds as a sign of class, power, and, most importantly, love... And all the producers want us to do is to ask nicely for a ""good"" diamond?...<br/><br/>If that movie touched you, find out more about the diamond brainwash and the African civil war tragedies. Open your eyes."
"guitargurunmu","10","236","346","10 December 2006"," Blood Diamond is a Bloody Good Time!
","First I want to say I went into this movie with hopes of it being great but had heard numerous slams against the acting, mostly Leo's accent. Wow were they DEAD WRONG! The movie delivers everything it should have and more. I like going into a movie and being entertained and learning something at the same time, especially at the ridiculous costs of tickets now days. I must say the movie was graphic at times but I think it needed to be in order to get the point across so if you have trouble watching terrible things happen to people including children then I wouldn't recommend this movie. Overall I hope this movie gets some nods when it comes around to Oscar time, Leo deserves a nod for sure whether it be from this movie or from The Departed. So if you don't have a problem with violence and want to learn something and be entertained at the same time then this is the movie you want to see! Kudos to Ed Zwick and everyone involved in making this wonderful film, it was a real treat to watch."
"RestlessRust","8","186","273","11 December 2006"," Blood Brothers
","What does it take to turn someone into a killer? The answer is different for each character involved in this movie. For some it is survival. For others it is the hope of escape from a life of hell. For some it is family. For others it is greed. Caught in the middle of it all are the children who have such little desire to kill for any reason that they must be brainwashed into becoming the instruments of their masters who claim to offer freedom.<br/><br/>Every few years an action movie comes along that has amazing depth. Terminator 2 and The Matrix are such movies, and so is Blood Diamond. It is full of characterizations we've seen before, but it's the interaction that raises this film above the masses. Each character has an agenda that forces him or her to distrust everyone else. The paths that some relationships take to develop trust are believable, while others are equally believable in remaining eternally antagonistic. And through it all is the realization that while some characters may change their methodology and morals, none ever change their dreams. Each character fights for the goal to the bitter end. Such is human nature, and such is the conflict of Blood Diamond, the conflict of Africa. In the end, we are left to wonder if peace can ever be attained in such a world. And somehow we are left believing that maybe it can."

How do I express my utter satisfaction & amazement with this film.<br/><br/>Take Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance over the last 15 years and multiply it by 10. He is mind-blowing. Awarding him an Oscar for Blood Diamond would not be a big enough compliment for the way he aced the role of Danny Archer.<br/><br/>The fabulous & flawless Charles Leavitt script is only enhanced by Ed Zwick's masterful directing job. Djimon Hounsou is perfectly cast and is more-than-believable when he wields a shovel.<br/><br/>And, Jennifer Connelly's understated elegance & expressiveness is captivating. <br/><br/>Put this movie at the top of your list."

","An undeniably powerful and breathtaking film from talented director Edward Zwick. 'Blood Diamond' is a beautifully shot war thriller set against the backdrop of the Sierra Leone civil war, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou in their Oscar-nominated roles. By far one of the best war dramas of modern times, 'Blood Diamond' is a powerful testament in the film industry boasting intense and well-executed action scenes and heart-wrenching drama. Zwick's vision truly outpaces his narrative in this compulsive and thought-provoking tale. An exciting and compelling tale, that stand as a great acting showcase for the two leads."
"TheUnseenMovieLover","8","6","7","30 March 2008"," A Terrific Movie, Though Let Down Slightly By Its Ending
","In all of the movies that he has starred in (that I have seen), up until Catch Me If You Can, Leonardo DiCaprio has delivered reasonable but hardly block-busting performances. He had a superbly roguish charm in Titanic, and provided a considerable amount of tension in Gangs of New York, but these performances still didn't have the extra ""oomph"" that would boost the star to award-worthy levels.<br/><br/>However, since watching Catch Me If You Can, I have developed a deep respect for DiCaprio. Ever since that movie, his performances have just been getting better and better. And, just after the breathless exhilaration of his brilliant performance in Martin Scorsese's The Departed, Blood Diamond came out in cinemas.<br/><br/>Before I continue with the review for the rest of the film, I have something to say. As smuggler and former soldier Danny Archer, DiCaprio gives a rip-roaring, heart-pulsating performance of such breath-taking quality that he almost steals the movie from under the very talented noses of Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly.<br/><br/>With an absolutely top-notch accent and a gruff attitude that will undoubtedly insult a few Titanic fans, DiCaprio takes a huge risk with this role and ends up giving one of the best performances of his career. He is 100% believable in every minute of the film that he graces, and oozes crackling intensity. If I were asked to describe the performance in one sentence, I would say that it was undeniably Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>Sierra Leone, 1999. Fisherman Soloman Vandy's (Djimon Hounsou) life is destroyed when rebels invade his village and separate him from his family. Forced to work in the diamond fields, Solomon discovers a rare, pink diamond. He manages to hide it, but not before the leader of the rebels, Captain Poison (David Harewood) sees the diamond. Whilst being held in prison for being associated with rebels, Solomon encounters smuggler Danny Archer (DiCaprio), who says that he will help Solomon to find his family in exchange for the diamond. Together with reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), Danny and Solomon set out to track down both Solomon's family and the diamond, which is still in hostile territory. <br/><br/>I have only seen one other movie directed by Edward Zwick, and that was the flawed yet brilliant Last Samurai. True, Blood Diamond is flawed, but it manages to match and in some areas (such as the top-notch story and cast) even surpass The Last Samurai in sheer quality. Zwick does a marvellous job, crafting some compelling action to go along with smart ideas and realism.<br/><br/>The acting is the most impressive factor in the movie. In my opinion, the only cast member who is able to stand against the wrath of DiCaprio is Djimon Hounsou. As Solomon Vandy, Hounsou delivers a performance full of such true, raw emotion that he confidently ensures that DiCaprio doesn't blow him off the screen. There are some moments of Hounsou's performance which are so heartbreakingly human and turmoiled that you aren't likely to forget this exceptional performance for a long time. Praise also for Jennifer Connelly, who delivers an energetic, feisty and humane portrayal of the film's main female character.<br/><br/>However, there are also scene-stealing turns from two members of the supporting cast; David Harewood and Arnold Vosloo. As the rebel captain who kidnaps Solomon's son amongst other things in order to find the diamond of the title, Harewood oozes a sadistic type of charisma. In one scene, after confronting a worker trying to conceal a diamond that he has just discovered, the captain calmly and smoothly shoots the worker in the stomach at point blank range, before walking away as if it were completely normal. He is an absolutely top-notch villain, perfectly realised by Harewood. <br/><br/>As a colonel and friend of Archer's, Vosloo gives a performance of gripping authority and commanding presence which makes the character much more than the caricature that he could have so easily become. His final scene is strangely poignant, due to the superb character moments between him and DiCaprio. <br/><br/>The settings, visuals and cinematography in the movie are also superb, adding a grand sense of grim reality and beauty to the proceedings. Its message is also pure and meaningful, and would have been perfectly realised if it weren't for the films only flaw. That flaw is called the ending.<br/><br/>There was the potential for an absolutely perfect ending. After being fatally wounded, Archer dies on the side of a cliff, whilst Solomon and his son fly to safety. That ending would have been the final factor that would have convinced me to give the movie full marks. But unfortunately, Zwick tries to bite off more than he can chew. His direction up until this point is always confident and assured, never becoming bogged down. But the ending feels like it has just been put into the movie as a last minute attempt to handle more political issues, which ultimately results in the betrayal of the rest of the movie. However, this is only one flaw (although it is reasonably significant). The overall result is a thrilling yet intelligent movie, with powerful performances, captivating visuals and and cinematography and effective emotional power. I highly recommend it, even if you just want to watch Leonardo DiCaprio or Djimon Hounsou."

","Beautifully filmed. The three leads are at their very best. An incredibly stunning story that will stay with you for a long time after. For me, the one negative item in this beauty was the final scene. I don't know what compelled the filmmakers to shoot the final scene in what amounted to a gratuitously happy, Disney-like ending -- our long suffering hero surrounded by grinning journalists, politicians and do-gooders in a standing ovation. This detracted from the impact of the film when a simple caption stating Salomon's fortunate resolution over a stunning visual would have sufficed (they did this with other factual information anyway). Other than this very small item, Blood Diamond was well worth seeing. You'll never look at a diamond ring the same way again. I certainly wouldn't buy one."

","Users keep using the word ""entertain"" in discussing this film, and I don't understand it simply because this movie was not meant to ""entertain."" Unlike many movies these days, it is meant to inform. Another claim I've read: ""If you can get past the violence, it is a great film."" Well here's a thought: you're not supposed to ""get past"" the violence. It is presented in such a way that makes us grateful for every second of our stupid American lives. If you want to be entertained, see Casino Royale. If you want to change the way you think about your own life, then see Blood Diamond. It will make you feel grateful for the life you live, and make your heart start pumping for the right reason.

"garbis09","10","5","6","25 March 2012"," Blood Diamond
","I first saw this film in theaters with my brother and mother. I personally had no idea what the movie was going to be about, I am just a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan so I decided to check it out. I ended up loving the movie it was so interesting because, it was about something I had no idea was going on in the world and probably would never have learned about since I am a teenage boy and am not very interested in Diamonds. While watching the film I was just in complete shock the whole time. With in ten minutes of the film a peaceful village is ambushed and massacred by rebels, the director also was not shy about showing the gruesomeness of people being killed. I could not believe the things that were happening in this movie, people were either forced into slavery or murdered. Children were kidnapped and brainwashed. The kids were doing Drugs and murdering people it was really disturbing to see. I could not believe that this stuff was really happening in Africa but the film showed the statistics of the deaths of all the people from mining diamonds and it was all the proof I needed. Asides from all the graphic and disturbing scenes in the movie I loved the story line of a African man Solomon Vandy trying to find his kidnapped son, while Leonardo DiCaprio is more interested in finding the extremely rare and valuable Blood Diamond which Solomon Vandy has hidden in a rebel camp. I also love the transformation of Leonardo DiCaprios character from a selfish only cares about him self to a stand up guy who is willing to give up anything in the end for his new friend Solomon. I also Enjoyed the third main character Jennifer Connolly who is trying to bring light to conflict diamonds to the rest of the world so this madness can finally stop. Overall I loved the film and highly recommend it to any one, aside from the graphic scenes its a great film for anyone over the age of 13, I thought the acting was great and so was the story line and all the imagery used."

I will never again take for granted the freedom that we have here in Australia.<br/><br/>We complain about mindless things everyday forgetting that there are bigger problems in this world. We have it good and don't even know it. We constantly strive to make ourselves better, look better have nicer material things but where doesn't it get us and does it make us really happy??? NO it doesn't...it just makes us more empty because we didn't find that something to fill the void! I applaud Leonardo for bringing forward such an important issue. It's movies and actors like him that make a difference to our existence.<br/><br/>My world will never be the same again..I thank you for that ...It makes me want to be a better person! <br/><br/>Peace Liz<br/><br/>If you would like to comment please do so at lilucjo@yahoo.com"
"eve-taylor-1","8","16","26","5 January 2007"," I didn't buy a diamond, after researching the facts.
","I watched this film the day before me and my fiancé were going to go an choose an engagement ring! I am so glad I did, whilst watching it, was increasingly concerned about the subject matter, and logged on to get some facts. <br/><br/>Essentially, no one can guarantee that a diamond is 'conflict free' even now, with the Kimberly process in place. Diamonds can be smuggled to the countries that are signed up to the process. Figures range from 0.2% to 5% of diamonds sold are blood diamonds, so I didn't want to take any chances, whatever the percentage, (and how can anyone really know?) My fiancé bought me a simple, beautiful Burmese sapphire ring without diamonds instead (note. it is preferable not to buy sapphires from Bhutan). <br/><br/>I can see that the diamond trade are worried about this film and are back-tracking like crazy - trying to be top of internet searches so that we will support the diamond trade, but until it is 100% tight, I will not be buying diamonds.<br/><br/>The film asks that you insist the diamonds you buy are conflict free, and but there are no guarantee's. When buying the Sapphire, we insisted that the shop supported the Kimberly process in any case, even though we were not buying them - as it is a step todays limiting 'conflict' diamonds.<br/><br/>I am glad this intelligent, dramatic film has raised the profile of the trade in blood diamonds, so that the 70 year marketing campaign by the diamond trade, trying to get us to buy that 'special' diamond engagement ring is shown for what it is.<br/><br/>Not every girl does want a diamond (or blood) on her hand.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","6","39","74","29 January 2007"," The Constant Gardener dumbed down to jungle adventure level
","There is quiet intensity and explosive intensity. I was going to say that 'Blood Diamond' makes no pretense about subscribing to the latter, but the fact is that it does. On the one hand, it treats heavy, salient issues like diamond trade and the trafficking of child-soldiers in Africa, even including a few lines of warning in the credits, but on the other hand it is structured and executed like a generic adventure treasure hunt. It cannot decide what it wants to be, and regrettably botches through both paths.<br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of civil war and chaos in 1990's Sierra Leone, Blood Diamond follows Rhodesian mercenary (oooh, scary!) Danny Archer (Leonardo Dicaprio), Mende fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) and American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) on a quest to find a rare pink diamond that Solomon first found when he was forced to work in the diamond fields. It intertwines bouts of blood-soaked encounters with child-soldiers, one of which is Solomon's own son that has been taken from him, and with emotional blackmail it cues us in to feel for the miserable conditions in Africa and the venality with which things are run. <br/><br/>The problem is that every slightly serious sceneevery momentis interrupted by some loud explosion, gun violence or shouting and sometimes all three. This is irritating in the film and it suggests two things: the script is unbearably lazy and sees action galore as a plot device and way to avoid writing the end of 'difficult' scenes with conversation or character development or 'Blood Diamond' tells us that we should not take it seriously and just treat it as any run-of-the-mill action-adventure. The problem with this is that it lacks the charm and sparkle in the eye of 'Indiana Jones', and Dicaprio is much too moody and unlikeable as a protagonist.<br/><br/>I have not yet seen many of the Oscar nominated actors' performances, but Leonardo Dicaprio's interpretation of the hard-boiled mercenary is the least deserving so far. It baffles me that such an action-oriented adventure with such a testosterone-fuelled lead could snag nominations with the drama-favouring academy, and I suspect this is solely because of its hazy political core. In comparison, Dicaprio is like Daniel Craig in Casino Royale but without the serious, emotional scenes. Apparently his South African accent is fairly in-tune, according to South Africans, but it seems uneven, exaggerated and varying in pronunciation to me.<br/><br/>None of the other performances are noteworthy either. Djimon Hounsou, shouting does not a good performance make. Jennifer Connelly warms up slightly in her role, shifting from her usual emotionally numb and somber state to being a little smilier, but here she is at the mercy of an underwritten character and there are not many ways in which she can go. The supporting cast for 'Blood Diamond' may be rather one-dimensional caricatures of evil corporate white men and black hard-edged guerilla leaders with berets, but they serve their respective functions rather aptly, especially Michael Sheen's brief appearance. The only issue I have here is that African people speak broken English to each other. Even if they're from the same family.<br/><br/>In the end, 'Blood Diamond' snags the 6 out of 10 from me. The cinematography is gorgeous with a screen that is awash with dramatic colours and shots, the action is fast-paced and exciting and the atmosphere is admirably gritty and visceral in the deep jungles of Africa. It features a ridiculous, two-faced mix between heavy-handed politics á la Constant Gardener and adrenaline-pumping action á la... any action film. It should in all theory be possible to join these two sides, and 'Blood Diamond' possesses all the necessary ingredients to do so, but no blender in which to stir it.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

The cinematography is beautiful and the message for the movie is loud and clear. Edward Zwick once again has made a fantastic movie. The main thing is this movie hopefully will open everyone's eyes to the violence and abuse that blood diamonds cause.

"bob the moo","Null","6","8","1 October 2007"," Strong film despite the problems with merging a real horror with a traditional Hollywood narrative
","Separated from his family by rebels, fisherman Solomon is forced to work in the bloody diamond mines, locating diamonds that the rebels use to fund their war against the government. Danny Archer is a former mercenary who now smuggles diamonds out of the conflict zone into neighbouring Liberia so that they can be documented as legal. Maddy Bowen is a journalist, in the area to make a difference by exposing such illegal activity and the suffering it produces. When Solomon finds and hides a large diamond, Danny and Maddy both get involved in his life and on a journey into the horror of the illegal diamond trade.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure how to approach this film because it is so clearly a ""message"" film on a topical issue and Hollywood doesn't always have the best track record on this. However on the other hand it has been voted very highly on IMDb (one of the best 250 films ever made apparently) and generally well received by critics. Watching it you can see the duality at work within the production because on one hand it is trying to make sure we understand just how much suffering and death is associated with and supported by this trade but then it also needs to deliver a film to entertain the masses in order to get this message through. The meshing of these two aims is not always very successful but generally the approach works to a point. At some points it is quite shocking to see the casual treatment of life, the creation of child soldiers etc but then at other times it is more of an action movie, with Danny dodging bullets while women and children are hit. The story requires a plot and this doesn't really explore the reality of the trade so much as use it as a backdrop for a simple story where good prevails. Again I know this is a necessary part of getting the message to a mass audience, but it is hard to see where ""good"" is in this story.<br/><br/>So really I found myself wanting a much harder ride from the film  I genuinely wanted to feel angry and shocked by it but the approach maybe minimised that for me. This aside, the film is actually pretty good and it works well as a dramatic narrative within the setting of the diamond trade.<br/><br/>Zwick can do ""epic"" and indeed this is just what he does. OK, perhaps he is also responsible for some of the reality and horror being sucked out of it in the meantime, but you cannot really have an issue with his direction when it comes to the sweep of the film and specifically some of the bigger action shots. His cast are roundly good as well. DiCaprio does well with the accent, even if it takes a second or two to get used to. I liked that he never seemed to be undergoing a significant ""realisation"" as the film went on  he was better than that and he knew his character. Hounsou is better and does dominate the film thanks mainly to the ""better"" material handed to him; he is convincing and drew me into his character. Connelly doesn't do anything wrong but is only so-so, again due to her character's place in the script. Support from Sheen, Vosloo, and others is roundly solid.<br/><br/>Overall then a strong film despite the problems with merging a real horror with a traditional Hollywood narrative."

","I just saw Blood Diamond and I didn't know what to expect, because when I saw the trailer, it just didn't look that exciting to me. I wasn't even sure what this was about, but after the Oscar nods it got and a fantastic review from my friend, I figured that I should check it out. I have to say that this film just broke my heart, it was so good, but so depressing. I never realized how brutal it was to go through these diamond mines, and men turning against their own brothers so quickly, it was so incredibly horrifying to watch and just utterly heart wrenching. But it was so well done and presented, the actors were just incredible and touched my heart, their stories were so uncomfortable and aching to witness, but just so inspirational.<br/><br/>In Africa there is a huge civil war going on, the RUFF's are fighting to keep their diamonds and not hand them over to the government, even if it means destroying villages of their own kind and making men into slaves and turning young boys into brutal killing soldiers. Danny Archer has come to get a priceless diamond that a slave, Solomon, has hidden, Danny promises to help get Solomon's family back if Solomon gets the diamond and gives it to him. Solomon's heart breaks even further when he discovers that his son has been taken hostage to become a soldier and has been brainwashed to turn against his own father, but Danny's mind is only set on that diamond and will do whatever he can to get it.<br/><br/>I loved Danny's character, Leonardo did such a fantastic job, Danny's heart was so cold in the beginning, but he did such a noble thing for Solomon and his son, but I won't give away what he did, this is a movie you have to see. It's a movie that will keep you thinking after it's finished, I can tell you one thing, I will never look at diamonds the same way again, this movie got under my skin, I think it will for you too.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I liked it ... I liked it a lot. Leo has grown up. The scenes between the native Africans work extremely well. The relationship between Leo and Jennifer doesn't jump off the screen but it works. The movie is exciting, emotional, and provocative. The problem I have with the film is one of logic. There are a few times I just didn't believe the characters would be doing what the script was calling for them to do. If those moments had been removed ... or if Zwick had shown those moments from the POV of the characters so we could understand WHY they were doing what they were doing, it would be a better film. I gave it an 8 ... but really it's a 7.5. <br/><br/>The other thing is that this film is ABOUT something. It's about an important political issue that has often been overlooked. That is what is IMPORTANT about this film. The subject matter. I hope that this film will create an awareness about the horrible plight in Africa and the Western exploitation of their resources and their people."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","18","33","4 February 2007"," The movie tries to tell a story but it gets muddled in into its sentiments, action sequences and other Hollywood clichés.
","The problem with ""Blood Diamond"" is that it tries to tell an important and powerful story and even tries to make a statement but it does this too much in an Hollywood kind of way, with over-the-top and far from believable dramatic plot lines, of course a misplaced love-story, lots of action and a happy Hollywood ending. Had the movie been done more in a ""Syriana"", so to speak, kind of style, the movie without doubt would had been better, more powerful and definitely more realistic. No doubt that the movie would then had been one of the year's best.<br/><br/>I must admit that I have a weak spot for Edward Zwick movies. His movie are always over-the-top with its dramatic moments and action (for instance; ""Glory"", ""The Last Samurai"") but it's always done in such a beautiful and effective way that you immediately forgive him. This unfortunately really wasn't the case with ""Blood Diamond"".<br/><br/>""Blood Diamond"" is a movie about a true and also still relevant subject about the lust for diamonds (mainly from the West) and the power struggles and fighting it takes with them over the diamonds in African countries, in this case Sierra Leone. The common African person is being the victim of it all and they're actually being enslaved to work in diamond fields and mines or to join the rebel, fighting the government over control of the diamond business. This is already a good, powerful and effective premise on its own, so it really is to bad that the movie feels the need to put in sentimental, personal plot lines and lots of action sequences, while it should had focused more on the bigger picture of it all.<br/><br/>The movie also doesn't always flow well. I mean, it's day and night and day again, sometimes in a matter of seconds. It's something that too often is that case with movies that run over 2 hours long.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is a good main lead for this movie and he adds another good role to his impressive list. He especially did a very good job with the accent. Djimon Hounsou is also good in his role, but I still think that he should stop playing roles like this. Ever since his ""Amistad"" he's been typecast over and over again, with this movie forming no exception to that. He's a great actor that truly should concentrate more on more different serious, carrying roles. The movie also features Jennifer Connelly, Arnold Vosloo and Michael Sheen, among others, in good roles.<br/><br/>The movie tries to be emotional and even shock, by showing some of the cruelties that are going on and also with some sequences involving child-soldiers. Problem is that the movie tries to be too realistic with it all, while the movie its approach and style really don't make this a realistic or powerful movie to watch. It also causes the more serious and sentimental sequences to not work out halve as powerful or confronting as intended. The movie features also far too many action sequences to take the movie really as a serious one but rather as an entertaining typical Hollywood movie, with dramatic elements in it.<br/><br/>At the end the movie even makes a statement by literally telling us (us being the Western World) not to buy conflict diamonds. This is not the way to give us this message. If you really wanted to make a statement, you should had made the movie more effective and powerful Mr. Zwick. That way the images and story would already speak enough for itself and you wouldn't had even needed this kind of text at the end, right before the credits.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely well made in terms of its style and the way the sequences are build up and constructed. The movie still shows that Edward Zwick is a great director, who just should had chosen a different approach with its story.<br/><br/>But you just can't rate the movie negative. It's too professionally made and looking for that. Especially the action sequences know to impress. It's good looking all, with some good camera-work and good looking landscapes and environment. It definitely helps the movie that it was shot mostly on location in Africa.<br/><br/>A well made, good looking movie but with a message that due to the way of film-making and storytelling just doesn't come across.

"Barky44","8","4","5","22 December 2006"," Decent enough movie, but could have used better editing
","Blood Diamond is my kind of movie. It has action, and stunts, and explosions, but they are really used to propel the storyline, not in and of itself. It also has an overriding ethical theme to it, in this case the tragedy that is war-torn Africa.<br/><br/>It's a very compelling storyline. A simple fisherman from Sierra Leone tries to raise his family and educate his children. Yet the rebels have a different plan: they attack the village, slaughter many, drive the rest away, and capture the fisherman, making him a slave in a diamond mine. He discovers a large pink diamond, tries to smuggle it away, and the story begins.<br/><br/>The story of modern-day Africa is not a simple one, and this plot is not a simple plot. They touch on the constant state of rebellion of some of these nations; they touch on the practice of turning boys into soldiers and killers; they touch on cross-tribal slaughter; and yes, they touch on the notion of blood diamonds.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. Not fantastic, but decent. Leo DiCaprio does a fine job as Danny Archer, a mercenary diamond smuggler. This isn't an Oscar-worthy turn, sometimes his accent is cloying, and his final scene is a bit overdone, but his performance isn't too distracting and, in general, is pretty good. He's just a bit better in The Departed IMO.<br/><br/>I liked Djimon Hounsou as the fisherman, Solomon Vendy. But he, too, overreaches at times. I think he suffers from writing or direction at times, you can tell he's being directed by a white American, his ""African-ness"" doesn't really shine through. In other words, he's just a bit too unbelievable as a Sierra Leone peasant, but, like Leo, he does a good enough job with it.<br/><br/>I wasn't totally thrilled with Jennifer Connelly in the role of reporter Maddy Brown. I'm not sure if it was her, or her character, that I had a problem with. It seems they just threw her in there because the film needed a conscience, and she solves some inconvenient plot holes, but overall, I don't think this particular character adds much to the film.<br/><br/>That brings me to the overall flaw with this film, and the reason I give it an 8 instead of a 10. What the film really needed was editing and tightening. The addition of the Brown character, plus the expansion of the diamond cartel into an army of mercenaries, distract the viewer from the real meat and bones of the film. The best parts of this film are the unworkable relationship between Archer and Solomon; Solomon's quest for his family's safety (including his search for his soldier son); the overall chaos and brutality of a nation at war; and the sliminess of the blood diamond trade. Anything else (the reporter, some Dicaprio-Connelly sexual tension, the mercenaries), really distracted from those important elements and really should have been chopped, not on the cutting room floor, but in the script revision process.<br/><br/>Filmmakers need to learn how to cut to the heart of the movie and tell that story, and leave the chaff by the wayside.<br/><br/>8 out of 10, points taken off for some poor editing choices.<br/><br/>Barky"
"deltajuliet","8","11","19","3 December 2006"," Pretty Good, Not Quite Great
","For your information, this review contains mild spoilers of the film's storyline.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond had a lot of potential. It had opportunities for action, compelling situations, compelling characters, etc, but it didn't seem to fully realize them.<br/><br/>There were plenty of moments of action, but they seemed to always be filmed with a shaky camera and quick cuts. Sure, that might make it seem more like you're there, but it got pretty old pretty fast. The audience began to not know what was going on or where the main characters were or where the bad guys were. This really subtracted from several scenes that could have been very memorable, like a rebel invasion of Sierra Leone's capital city Freetown.<br/><br/>Much of the movie revolved around the rebel forces of the RUF in Sierra Leone, who kidnapped the son of Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou). Solomon is then taken prisoner by the RUF and forced to dig up diamonds. South African smuggler Danny Archer (DiCaprio, now surely one of the best actors, not only of his generation, but in moviedom today) learns of a diamond worth quite a bit of money that Solomon had found, and most of the movie follows Solomon as he searches for his family and Archer as he searches for the diamond. Archer tells Solomon with the money they could make with the diamond, finding his family would be a breeze, so they stick together. Reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) hooks up with the pair upon learning of Archer's connections to conflict diamond corporations and their important people. Wanting to really help the victims of the conflict, Maddy helps Solomon and Archer on their quests so that she can get information on the conflict diamond dealers and take them down.<br/><br/>Solomon's son is forced to fight for the RUF, and becomes a completely desensitized, killing machine. This could have been very, very powerful, but it wasn't quite as heart-wrenching as it could have been. It does, however, provide for a great, gut-wrenching moment of tension later in the film. Solomon himself is played well. Hounsou plays him with a sense of innocence, and we do care about him and his journey to find his family. Connelly, too, is an idealistic journalist who wants to help the world, and we come to believe that her well-intentioned motivations are completely genuine. DiCaprio, as always, is terrific. I'm not completely sure what a South African accent should sound like, but his seemed convincing enough to me. He is a man on a mission, and we believe it. It was especially a treat to see his character develop. The best thing about Archer's development is that, while he goes from being selfish to selfless, it's not unbelievable or clichéd. He doesn't just become a good guy, he convincingly transforms from (a closet racist) anti-hero to hero. All around good and great acting in Blood Diamond.<br/><br/>The end concludes with a political message somewhere along the lines of Lord of War, which kind of killed the mood, but it's certainly nice that the movie is actually about something important (i.e. conflict in Africa that, according to Maddy, we might catch on the news somewhere ""between sports and weather"").<br/><br/>Blood Diamond is done well, but not quite as well as it could have been. Still, it made for a good movie, one of the better of 2006, and I'm glad I saw it.<br/><br/>8/10"
"jkb851","10","5","7","27 May 2013"," Horrifying story uncovered on a matter of events to enlighten and entertain!
","Blood Diamond is a brilliant movie! It's a rare gem that sends a huge political message on one of the many, malevolent schemes and systems, that are happening in this world! This one in particular are the trade and smuggling of Blood Diamonds and Child Soldiers. The movie is very disturbing. Rarely do we a see a motion picture show such horrible schemes going on in the world. <br/><br/>It's the story of a fisherman (Soloman Vandy) with high hopes for his son, when his village is burned down and ruined by the RUF. He's is separated from his family and is sent to work in Diamond hunting camps. Where he finds a huge gem, hides it barely escaping with his life and the story ensues from their on end. Taking place during the civil war in Sierra Leone. The movie accurately portrays the corruptness of the malevolent smuggling scheme used for smuggling conflict diamonds and the even more disturbing, use of child soldiers. Young children are kidnapped and go by the doctrine of men who convince them of evil and that their family are weakness's utilising them as weapons. If you've seen 'Kony 2012' you get the idea. It's used to great effect on one of the story lines in which Soloman's son in kidnapped and transformed into a child soldier. Displaying the morale of the bond between father and son no matter what.<br/><br/>The second underlying story is of Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) an ex solider turned business man who is a definitive example of damaged characters. He is keen on nothing more than leaving Africa due to the horrible things he's seen in this 'uncivilised' place. He has to battle with his inner demons and desire to find whats right. He bonds brilliant with Soloman in the movie even though at first he had the intentions to exploit the situation which he is in. He falls in love with Maddy (Jennifer Conolly) whose character has the different convictions and believes in hope. Something that's been taken from him young of age. <br/><br/>The third underlying story is of Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Conolly) a journalist who's on the struggle to do good. To make change in the world. She's an amazing representation of finding love and hope in small things and how an individual can change the world, as you see her struggle to change the world and get the information on conflict diamonds. <br/><br/>These three riveting story lines are flawlessly sewed together to present a masterpiece taken place during rough times, yet utilising the beauty of Africa in the cinematography to give you an entertaining movie with great dialogue, satisfying villain, soul shattering soundtrack and many morals (including how you look at jewellery and ""good things happen everyday"" -Maddy Bowen).<br/><br/>Please watch this movie!"

"Chrysanthepop","Null","5","7","2 August 2008"," A Flood Of Blood For A Piece Of Diamond
","'Blood Diamond' is a very Hollywood film but at the same time it stays very true to the facts. Zwick does not overload the viewer with its 'Hollywoodness'. There are bombs exploding and lots of shooting and killing but it's not overdone like in other flicks. The enigmatic African landscape is stunningly captured (even though it wasn't specifically filmed in Sierra Leone) and the score is both mesmerizing and haunting. The cinematography is superb as it gives the film a slick feel and also gives the landscape a role of its own.<br/><br/>Though the story is somewhat predictable it does not effect the film in a negative way. Zwick refrains from using clichés like putting a sex scene (which would have only deviated from the main plot line) or a conventional happy ending. The slick execution makes 'Blood Diamond' entertaining, gripping and moving. It moves at a steady pace. Rosenblum's editing is good and Leavitt's screenplay is solid and engaging. The characters are well written and the insanity of the blood thirsty rebels is well depicted in a few scenes and the sequence where they brainwash the children turning them into immediate murderers, is chilling. While many seem to disagree, I thought the problem of conflict diamond is effectively presented in this movie.<br/><br/>I never thought Leonardo Dicaprio would ever reach the heights he did with his acting in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' (which I considered his best work). He's been good in many films (like 'Catch Me If You Can') and bad in some (like 'Titanic', 'The Man In The Iron Mask' but I can say that his performance in both 'Gilbert Grape' and 'Blood Diamond' are his career best (though I have yet to see 'The Aviator'). In my opinion, they surpass the overrated 'The Departed'. I've always liked Djimon Hounsou's acting (especially in films like 'Amistad' and 'In America') and here he does not disappoint one bit. The actor skillfully underplays his part and is only explosive when required. The scenes between him and Dicaprio are a treat to watch. Then there's the radiant Jennifer Connelly, another actor who's performances never let down. She has a comparatively smaller role but makes the best of it. All three actors form an interesting and entertaining trio. The supporting cast do well.<br/><br/>While the 'Hollywoodness' gives it an entertaining quality, I think it takes away some of the rawness and that slightly hinders the film from being more hard-hitting (like 'Hotel Rwanda'). But it is pretty much an either - or situation and I still think the issues are presented well enough to balance the effectiveness of the real problem and entertainment.<br/><br/>Overall, Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' is an excellent gripping drama thriller that showcases the talents of actors Hounsou and Dicaprio, writer Leavitt, music director Newton Howard and director of photography Serra."
"kikiru","8","5","7","28 January 2007"," A very moving film about a serious global issue
","I've been reading up on the diamond industry, and in particular the problem of blood diamonds, for 6 or 7 years now. So of course I was interested in checking out this film. First, I have to join the chorus of praise about Djimon Hounsou -- he is phenomenal. I think DiCaprio and Connelly are strong in this film, too, but the role of Solomon Vandy is so much more compelling and dramatic, and requires so much more from an actor, that Hounsou just just leaves them in his wake. The battle scenes (more like massacre scenes, actually) are frightening, overwhelming, and seemingly relentless. The movie does a great job of impressing upon the audience the sheer terror of just trying to survive in war-torn Sierra Leone. I do have three criticisms of this film. I found DiCaprio's last scene too drawn out; I think it would have been more impactful with less...just less. I also sensed some holes in continuity from time to time -- wait, how did we get from there to here again? Did I miss something? And the biggest disappointment of the film for me was the message shown at the film's conclusion: that diamond buyers should ""insist on conflict-free"" stones. To me, that is a completely pansy-assed conclusion that flies in the face of everything this movie is about. The message should be simply Do not buy any diamonds, period. Do you honestly think that the massive amount of money behind the diamond industry cannot find ways to lie about the origin of stones? Come on, don't be naive."
"Buddy-51","7","9","15","4 January 2007"," flawed but compelling social drama
","""Blood Diamond"" may well result in the biggest boon yet for the cubic zirconium business. This latest work by Edward Zwick tackles a serious social issue in the guise of popular entertainment, which turns out to be both the greatest weakness and the greatest strength of the film.<br/><br/>""Blood"" diamonds, also known as ""conflict"" diamonds, are those that are mined in war zones, then sold to finance those wars. Set in 1999, the movie features Leonardo DiCaprio as a largely amoral diamond smuggler who is plying his trade in war-torn Sierra Leone on the west coast of the African continent. Through a series of complicated events, Danny Archer meets up with a native named Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) who knows the whereabouts of a rare, priceless diamond that Archer, along with virtually everybody else in the film, would love to get his hands on. Solomon, however, needs its as a bargaining chip to ransom his wife and children who have been turned into refugees as a result of the internecine war occurring between the government and rebel forces out to enslave people like Solomon in the local mines. Jennifer Connelly plays a compassionate American reporter determined to expose the evil and corruption involved in the blood diamond business to a largely apathetic and hitherto unresponsive world at large.<br/><br/>With a screenplay by Charles Leavitt, based on a story by him and C. Gaby Mitchell, Zwick has fashioned a generally powerful film whose occasional dramatic contrivances can be easily forgiven in light of the salutary goal of the film. One could object to the fact that, yet again, a story set in the Third World seemingly needs to be told through the eyes of white people from the West. The movie tries to overcome this handicap by making it clear that Archer is actually from Zimbabwe - and DiCaprio has the South African accent to prove it - but the air of First World condescension is faintly evident nonetheless. Still, given the sad fact that such an approach was probably necessary even to get the film green-lighted let alone funded, one cannot really hold that against the filmmakers. The movie also indulges in a few too many action movie clichés - hairbreadth escapes, in-the-nick-of-time rescues, the near-miraculous dodging of bullets etc. - but, again, the movie makers clearly know they must first get the attention of their target audience before they can enlighten them about the situation at hand. Moreover, the film is a bit too long at 138 minutes and suffers from attenuation and repetition in its final half hour.<br/><br/>Those negatives aside, ""Blood Diamond"" is, for the most part, an effective piece of serious commercial movie-making, thanks, primarily, to Zwick's skill as a director and to the fine performances by DiCaprio, Connelly and, especially, Hounsou, whose quiet dignity and fierce determination do much to personalize the plight of the innocents caught in a hellhole of wanton slaughter and crass de-humanization. Perhaps the greatest strength of the movie is that it doesn't stint in showing us the brutality and widespread individual suffering brought about by this mad rush towards profit and greed. In addition, Archer's slow awakening to the depths of the human tragedy occurring around him and his own shameful participation in it may be predictable from a narrative standpoint, but it gives the film the moral weight and thematic depth it needs to elevate it above the level of a mere exploitative action picture."
"eastbergholt2002","8","6","9","28 April 2007"," Good Film / Flawed History
","Blood Diamond is an enjoyable action movie. It's set against the backdrop of of Sierra Leone's civil war of the 1990s and is a story of child soldiers, anarchy and savagery. The film incorporates a mixture of fact and made-up history. However the film serves a useful role in showing the country's descent into hell. Over a ten-year period 500,000 people  about one tenth of the population  were murdered, maimed or raped. The film sticks closely to Hollywood storytelling conventions so is tries to manufacture a feel-good ending and turns a diamond / gun smuggler (DiCaprio) into a hero. <br/><br/>The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in Sierra Leone sell diamonds to buy guns. Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy a fisherman whose life is changed when the RUF arrive and start killing and hacking off the limbs of his fellow villagers. Vandy is kidnapped and made to work in the rebel operated mines. He finds and hides a huge rock before being rescued by government troops. He is held in a prison and meets Danny Archer (DiCaprio) who wants to sell the diamond while Vandy just wants to find his wife and kids. The film is about their attempts to find the diamond and save Vandy's family. <br/><br/>Danny starts the movie as a tough and cynical Rhodesian mercenary and diamond smuggler. DiCaprio is a big star so his character becomes more sympathetic as the film wears on. He ends the movie as a soft hearted guy prepared to risk his life for others. Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is the female interest. She starts the movie as a hard-bitten war reporter looking for a story. She latches onto Danny and seems to fall for him. Leonardo's accent isn't quite right, he sounds like an Afrikaaner rather than a Rhodesian / Zimbabwean.<br/><br/>All Hollywood movies have to have bad guys and the film blames a fictitious British diamond company and a group of ruthless South African mercenaries. This is inaccurate. In the real world the RUF forced thousands of civilians into work gangs harvesting the stones, which they handed to Charles Taylor, neighboring Liberia's infamous warlord, in return for guns. The film states that Sierra Leone is now at peace and implied it was because of lobbying from the guy from 7th Heaven (playing an invented character called Ambassador Walker). The implication is that the U.S. helped protect Africa from greedy and cynical Brits. <br/><br/>The reality is that Global Witness, a small British charity first publicized the ill-effects of conflict diamonds. Tony Blair's father taught at Fourah Bay university in Freetown. When the British based firm, De Beers stopped buying conflict diamonds there is evidence that many were merely diverted to Tel Aviv and Mumbai. In May 2000 Blair sent 2,000 British troops and a naval task force to Sierra Leone. The move saved Freetown from yet more bloodshed and led to the defeat of the RUF. <br/><br/>If you ignore the film's fallacious history lesson it works as a slick and exciting action movie. We still await a film that can properly explain the root causes of continent's problems. Sierra Leone is a poor country and it's people need money so people in the West should continue to buy diamonds."
"HiddenVoice","7","6","9","15 March 2007"," A message film trying to reach a wider audience through the conventional Hollywood formula.
","It's rare to find films like these in Hollywood nowadays.But they are still plagued by the Hollywood formula.So is the case with Blood diamond.A thoughtful and stunning action drama with a message to send out that gets bogged down by the Hollywood fatigue.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond could've been a great film,but that was never gonna happen.The film for the most part was solid.It kicks off well and holds on until its second half becomes your typical Hollywood drama with a Hollywood ending.But nevertheless,it gets its message across in a really effective way.And that's only because of director Edward Zwicks sincere effort.Probably his best film since the LAST SAMURAI.He carefully balances the film's message and action and big budget adventure and still capture the shocking accounts of brute in Sierra Leone.Where kids are given guns to roam free and kill whoever they wish to,where laws are broken and country is torn apart by civil war.<br/><br/>Danny Archer(Di Caprio) is a diamond smuggler who owes his boss and gets around to places quickly.He doesn't have a permanent home or location and he's really hard to trust or predict.But as he gets arrested for illegal smuggling he comes across another prisoner who is arrested for the wrong cause.Solomon Vandy (Djimon Honsou) is caught by the rebels while trying to help his family escape.He is forced to dig diamonds from the ground until Vandy finds the blood diamond,which he hides and keeps safe.As he is captured by the government he is pursued by Archer,who will help him find his family and get back his son from the rebels; only if he gets him his blood diamond.Along the way Archer meets an optimistic journalists (Jennifer Connelly) who is more interested in getting the information of how illegal diamond smuggling works than getting her share of the price.And only Archer can give her that information.The three embark on a deadly adventure through the torn Sierra Leone,where gunfire and killings are a routine and can come out of anywhere.But there are secrets Archer is hiding and he is desperate to have that diamond in his possession before others capture them.<br/><br/>Sounds like your typical,old-fashioned action-adventure.But think again,this ones got a message and it's executed with unconventional sense until we reach its final third half.It's done with excitement and enough action to lure the average moviegoer into the theatres.Because that's the only way to get the message and horrifying events to its audiences to realize what their diamonds cost.<br/><br/>But it also feels clichéd and old-fashioned in parts.The screenplay should've been way better and there was potential in it.But the writer opts for the usual Hollywood flairs.That is not to say that the script doesn't have strengths.It does have some really well written parts with strong lead characters.And it tells a very honest story.But it could've worked a little more.<br/><br/>It's the Director that keeps everything afloat and Zwick is best at these kinds of films.He is not afraid to show us what Sierra Leone was really like a few years back.How it tore itself apart due to the civil war.And how the world didn't gave a damn about it even if they said they do.The world is just there for the benefit.The governments promise help and they just never provide any.Either they are limited or they don't get what they want.It's the political side of it that destroys and promotes the kinds of things that went on in Sierra Leone and that is true even now in other parts of the world,like IRAQ.<br/><br/>What would an average moviegoer say about films like these?He'll think about it a lot and try to think of a way to help,but the next day he'll forget about it and pretend he never even saw anything like this.And that's what has been happening.We make films like these to open everyone's eyes and once they've had their eyes wide open they close them and move about their business.So,what's the point of making these kinds of films.<br/><br/>The main strength of this film is that it is a message movie packed into a commercial film.So that it could reach a wider audience.And for that it's recommended.Another reason is the characters and the events they go through,which are executed skillfully by a veteran like Ed Zwick.<br/><br/>Di Caprio has been making some really great films the past few years.Post-Beach,he's been making some really memorable and striking pictures and working with the best in Hollywood.And each time his performances get better and better.As Danny Archer,Di Caprio infests unpredictability in an otherwise predictable anti-hero.He makes us hard to predict Danny's moves.You are not sure whether you should trust him or not,even till the final few moments of his time in the film.But he makes Danny more human and sympathetic.And he nails it once again with his biting performance.It's unlike any character he's ever played and he's a totally different kind of Di Caprio here.But,I still loved his portrayal of Howard Hughes more than this.And every time he is beaten by a greater performance at the year end awards.Ironically,they were African-Americans,who beat him twice.And they both deserved it.Maybe,next time Di Caprio might finally win.And Djimon Honsou's fierce performance as a father in search of his son is so believable that you know he will do anything to get back his family.Jennifer Connelly doesn't have much to do.Well,her character won't allow her to ,except making the usual speeches and bashing.But Connelly looks stunning.<br/><br/>The film is packed with brilliant editing,exceptionally well staged,exciting action set pieces and good cinematography,with able score.It's a well made film only hampered by its weak screenplay.It's filled with a stunning production values and entertains fully.But it certainly could've been a great film and it had the potentials to be.It's only strong performances and able direction that propels and prevents this film from becoming your usual Hollywood action-adventure.It is worth checking out and will seriously hit you with its message about the cost of those bloody diamonds."
"diane-34","10","6","9","30 January 2007"," Human beings have much to answer for!
","The horror of this wonderful movie leaves one speechless; it is hard to comment on a movie such as Blood Diamond because the awful truth of our miserable existence comes flooding back rendering an intelligent response almost impossible.<br/><br/>I know political comments about movies must be framed extremely carefully but what I saw several days ago makes me want to explore ideas that probably should be left for a bar or BBQ. How do you deal with boy soldiers shooting prisoners blindfolded or hacking off the hands of people on the other side from the adults that use these boy-soldiers until they are used up or dead? Of course, you enter the theater knowing the outline of the story but then you must face the movie-facts of the real story that can be seen at night on the evening news--if your news will deal with it.<br/><br/>Like one of the African characters famously says in the movie, ""Its a good thing we don't have oil"" and doesn't that comment pierce the heart of the matter--their raw materials and western greed.<br/><br/>The cast was uniformly excellent. Connelly was perfect as the correspondent who knows the horror but also knows the hurdles in trying to get the story out to an ambivalent western world. DiCaprio plays the best role of his career to date. I find it laughable when people say an actor failed to maintain an accent through the entire movie. He went into and out of a white southern African accent; I don't care, it is enough that he tried, that it wasn't totally American and that his portrayal of a jaded diamond trader was a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>And last, the brilliant acting of Hounsou whose strength through the horror of his reality in Sierra Leone deserves the Academy for which he is nominated. He is a superb actor and I am sorry that he is offered roles of African men caught in this seemingly never ending story of African reactions to western greed.<br/><br/>Make an effort to see such a great contemporary tale--you will not be sorry."

You can see the sanitized, section of a community, which is a collection of the neat and pretty places touted by the chamber of commerce or you can ask for and be shown the 'ugly' side of the native habitat. Of course when you do, you may witness things you don't ever wish to see. That is what happens when you view the film "" Blood Diamond "". It's not only the director's raw evisceral take on Sierra Leone and the illegal diamond trade, but unfortunately the present picture in Africa. Yet, it's the courageous director who takes on what society at large wishes to remain ignorant of. Once the viewer sits down to watch this touching and unfortunately all too realistic film, he must also prepare himself for a painful reminder of mankind's dark and evil nature. The story is of Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) an ordinary Africaner, living peacefully in a village in Sierra Leone, with Dia Vandy (Kagiso Kuypers), his son and family when a civil war reaches them. Enslaved and sent to toil in a diamond mine, he cannot believe all the tragedy which has taken place. Enroute, he meets and is befriended by a opportunistic mercenary, named Danny Archer, (Leonardo DiCaprio) who learns, Vandy possesses valuable information on a priceless jewel which could insure Archer's lifelong dream, but may be the one chance which could secure his captive family's return. Together they are pursued by many factions. One is, Colonel Coetzee, (Arnold Vosloo) who also seeks the valuable find. Then there's, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) an American reporter seeking a way to expose the diamond merchants and their deadly human trade. Finally there is the civil war, the brutal officers and child-soldiers of the rebel army. Altogether, this film has much to offer, including some heartfelt stories from the characters themselves. ****"
"ccthemovieman-1","5","37","81","25 April 2007"," Overly Preachy & Clichéd
","I was enjoying this very much when Jennifer Connelly entered the story and it began to go downhill after that, big-time. Hey, I always found her pretty fascinating and easy on the eyes, but she seems to play annoying, bitchy characters that I can't stand. <br/><br/>Connelly's role isn't as obnoxious and unlikeable as she was her role in ""House Of Sand And Fog,"" but she's still moody, preachy, profane, sarcastic and too full of herself as she plays a journalist in the mode of some woman who thinks she's some great crusader. According to her, no one in the United States should ever buy a diamond ring for the fiancée/wife because they are akin to murderers if they do. This point is hammered several times and (1) is ludicrous; (2) unrealistic; (3) condescending to any audience of any intelligence.<br/><br/>That's the trouble with the picture, as a whole: too preachy. <br/><br/>We don't need points hammered home the way they are here, thinking us - the audience - is that stupid to get the messages the first or second time. The main characters are all movie cliché types - the greedy smuggler, Watergate-type journalist, brave African warrior, rich and uncaring white men running the operations, etc etc. <br/><br/>In addition, Leonardo DiCaprio's accent is just not believable, perhaps because is something we aren't used to hearing from him. It may not be his fault, because he's a good actor, but it didn't click. The accent didn't sound right, and it became distracting. Conelley, as mentioned, is just super annoying, only there for her looks. Dimon Hounsou as ""Soloman Vandy"" overacted. Raising one's voice here and there and screaming doesn't make one a good actor.<br/><br/>The cinematography was wonderful. This is nice-looking film which includes spectacular African scenery. It was, by far, the best thing about the movie."
"Rathko","9","13","24","4 December 2006"," Genre - Political Action Adventure
","This is a resubmitted review of a Test Screening edit, not the final movie. The original review was removed by IMDb for unknown reasons and has been edited. For the particularly sensitive, this review may contain SPOILERS! <br/><br/>'Blood Diamond' is the relatively simple story of an amoral diamond smuggler, Archer, helping a Liberian fisherman, Soloman, to find the giant pink diamond that he hid out in the bush while working in the diamond mines. Solomon agrees to act as Archer's guide in exchange for assistance in locating his family in some far flung refugee camp, and his son, kidnapped and brainwashed by Liberia's rebel forces.<br/><br/>If all this sounds rather dour and depressing, and far too political and preachy a movie to actually be entertaining, you couldn't be more wrong. In essence, 'Blood Diamond' is an old fashioned adventure movie that harks back to the days on 'King Solomon's Mines' or 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'. It's all wrapped up in contemporary events in West Africa and introduces the largely unavoidable politics only if and when they lend depth and motivation to a character, but it's still just an adventure story. An r-rated, messy and violent adventure story that shines a spotlight on a hidden region of the world, but an adventure story none-the-less.<br/><br/>Zwick, who I've never rated particularly highly as a director, injects the whole thing with genuine excitement and adrenaline. There are several action setpieces that are truly spectacular, and he manages to keep the focus tightly on the action and adventure while resisting the temptation to turn the whole thing in to a PBS documentary on the horrors of West African child soldiers.<br/><br/>Special note has to go the three leads. Di Caprio, following the excellent 'The Departed' delivers what could possibly be an even better performance. Not only does he manage to pull off the South African accent without a hitch, but he even manages to speak in pidgin English at one point without generating embarrassed snickers from the audience  no mean feat. He carries the role with a confidence that is unlikely to go unnoticed at award time. Hounsou brings the same impassioned intensity to his role that he's been summoning since 'Amistad', providing an emotional core to a movie populated by tired cynics. Connelly, who looks better than ever here, is, however, wasted. She delivers a great performance that subtly conveys the vulture nature of even the most well-meaning reporter, but her character is, quite bizarrely, required to leave the movie just when things get interesting. She and Di Caprio have such obvious chemistry that it's a mystery why the producers felt the need to split them up so soon after meeting.<br/><br/>Dan Weil's production design is outstanding and clearly award-worthy. He pretty much does what he did for 'Syriana'; that is, create an environment that seems so authentic that you can all but smell the garbage in the streets.<br/><br/>There are a couple of low points. The music, by James Newton Howard, is obvious, clichéd, overtly manipulative, and drew attention to itself at all the wrong moments. I was interested to see in his bio that he was responsible for the 'King Kong' soundtrack, which was one of the most irritating and repetitive in recent years.<br/><br/>The last 10 minutes, in which a bizarre and completely incongruous happy ending is tacked on to the movie, is terrible. It falls back on every feel-good cliché of the genre (note the ending of last year's 'The Constant Gardener') while betraying everything the movie has attempted to establish over the previous two hours. The story has a very clear and obvious ending, and it takes place on an African mountainside, not at a London press-conference. I'm hoping that Warner has the courage to de-Disneyfy the ending before release, as it greatly reduces the impact and credibility of the film.<br/><br/>'Blood Diamond' is an excellent movie, one of the best I've seen all year - a solid story, compellingly told, with actors delivering great performances. Should Warner decide to deepen the relationship between DiCaprio and Connelly and ditch the lousy ending, it would earn a full 10 out of 10. Whatsmore, it also prompted me to go out to the library and check out several books about the socio-political history of West Africa. I'm sure I won't be the only one, and that is where the true success of the movie lies."

","This is a laughable little piece of nonsense where the very real dilemma of of the inhuman treatment of diamond workers in Africa is given the ultra-slick Hollywood treatment. Leonardo DiCaprio is the living embodiment of a clichéd soldier of fortune that has populated Hollywood films since the days of Clark Gable: a mean stone-cold killer who can blow away whole armies of militia single-handedly while still displaying enough sensitivity to melt the heart of Jennifer Connelly, surely the most gorgeous investigative reporter to ever set foot on the continent.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou is the film's only contact with reality, giving an earnest performance as a diamond mine worker who finds and hides a priceless 100 karat pink diamond and tries to use the windfall to find his family, who have been separated by the brutal militia that have forced him into slave work in the mines. But DiCaprio and Connelly's characters are silly, slick products of the Hollywood oil factory, and nothing that they do or say has any plausibility or packs any emotional resonance. The sacrifices Leo makes at the film's comic book finish are the acts of a movie star who requires a heroic ending in his contract, not the behavior of a genuine human being."

","In 2003, director Edward Zwick was praised for his power to tie together seemingly conflicting cultures. His hit, The Last Samurai, told a story of a late 1800s American military advisor who adopted the Samurai culture of Feudal Japan. The longest lasting impression was not only the film's beauty, but its humanity. In 2006, Zwick returned. This time he again tugged on the world's heartstrings by depicting the plight of the African farmer, fisherman, and toiler whose lives are endlessly complicated by civil war.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond centers on Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a Sierra Leone commoner whose family is ripped apart when the Revolutionary United Front, a rebel group, sacks his village. Solomon is enslaved in a diamond mining camp whose product feeds rebel armament and Western greed for glitz and glamour. Solomon finds a giant diamond and decides to bury it, believing it will help him and his family in the future. But as the political climate in Sierra Leone deteriorates further, so do his chances of ever seeing his family again. Solomon encounters Danny Archer (DiCaprio) who seldom altruistically aids Solomon on his voyage.<br/><br/>The film is immersive, beckoning the viewer deep into the heart of Africa. Every frame feels authentic. The plant life, costumes, and culture brew before you into a stunning almost documentary take on life in Sierra Leone. Hounsou is the work's center of gravity. It has been a long time since an actor has displayed such peaks of brokeness, rage, wisdom, and fulfillment. The writing itself follows an easily identifiable three-act structure an nearly every scene seems in place. There are some moments that seem excessive, like the long montages of Solomon and Danny hiking over the African plains. These moments lead to an exhausting 143 minute run time, but the emotional payoff is well worth the investment.<br/><br/>Overall, the film succeeds in crafting an emotional adventure that makes us feel closer to our true selves. It kindles a sense of brotherhood and sisterhood across cultures and language barriers. It makes us appreciate the simple things we take for granted, things like going to school. And most importantly, it takes us far from our living rooms, dropping us off in a land of bold adventure."

I found it to be accurate in the portrayal of what the conflict areas in Africa are like, even though it was a mild representation, you do get a real sense of what things are like in an area like Sierra Leone during a conflict or in a state of development. From a cinematic point of view, I found that the film's wardrobe, props, effects, location and casting to be spot on. The shot choices including the cliché majestic wide shots of sunsets, sunrises, open fields and lush landscapes throughout the movie gave to the viewer that typical ""African"" movie experience. I do find this a very over used method when shooting a movie based in Africa, but one that does get the desired results and keeps with the genre traditions. Acting was on the same caliber as the rest of the film; although Leo didn't have a spot on accent it was believable enough for myself to let it slide. Over all it was an enjoyable film, but my biggest complaint is the random love story that was thrown into the mix, I found it a bit unnecessary and took away from the main story."

","Blood Diamond is a tale of juxtaposition: a naturally beautiful environment beset with unnecessary death and inhumane brutality and well engineered action and battle sequences with all of the adrenalin but none of the usual viewing satisfaction due to the reality of the subject matter.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond tells an intense personal story within the framework of a much larger, much more disturbing background of a turbulent time in world history. And it tells both extremely well.<br/><br/>The bigger picture shows tiny African nation Sierra Leone at the turn of last century, a land that has lost its way amid corruption and genocide, where armed forces and RUF rebels battle for supremacy with the innocents in the middle quite often the expendable pawns in an often savage and frankly depressing arm wrestle. Early scenes show indiscriminate slaughter of entire villages by rebels, with entire families simply and casually erased, and the boys taken and 'conscripted', and others too old to brainwash enslaved to work on the diamond fields under intense armed scrutiny.<br/><br/>Aaaaahhh the diamonds. Civil wars need funding, and as Sierra Leone at the time was a poor nation with millions living in squalid conditions the illicit diamond trade channeled countless millions into the war effort, directly financing the atrocities carried out.<br/><br/>This film should be screened for all brides-to-be in the months before the big day – the expenditure outlaid on tissues would result in huge savings with the ring purchase Which brings us to the 'small story' within the film. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Honsou), a simple fisherman separated from his family, finding himself enslaved on the diamond fields. Solomon finds a much sought after pink diamond of undoubted quality and incredible value. Rather than hand it over he decides this could mean freedom and escape for him and his family; only his theft doesn't go unnoticed and he is only saved from certain death when the field is attacked by government troops and he and his captors are imprisoned.<br/><br/>It is in prison that Danny Archer (Leonardo Di Caprio) hears first hand of the pink diamond and his ears prick up immediately. An ex-soldier, now an opportunistic middle man able to work all sides for his own benefit, Danny cares not for black or white; rebel or government, he is in it for himself.<br/><br/>He sees Solomon as his sparkly ticket out of Africa.<br/><br/>Danny eventually convinces Solomon that with his contacts and knowledge he can facilitate his escape to freedom and more importantly reunite him and his family. If he can get his hands on the diamond that is.<br/><br/>Things heat up further when the rebels invade the capital city and the new mismatched duo are forced to flee for their lives deeper into the lawless lands of the remote villages and surrounding areas. Here contacts and knowledge are less important, so ultimately Danny enlists the help of an American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) to use her press credentials to gain access to areas out of bounds to mere civilians.<br/><br/>Maddy initially uses her contacts to help Solomon track down his family, and as if the ordeal wasn't already depressing enough during the brief reunion he learns that his only son Dia has been taken and forcefully conscripted into the RUF, where he is now part of the threat against the innocent.<br/><br/>(Without going too much further the scenes where the boys are taken, beaten, bullied and brainwashed are both deeply disturbing and sadly realistic. They pale into insignificance when compared to the scenes only days later when those same children casually cut a swathe through waves of fleeing innocent villagers with automatic weapons, laughing and shrieking as they advance.) The remainder of the tale follows the trio as they move towards their own goals: for Solomon it is his family and freedom, Maddy wants the big story, and for Danny it is the diamond. With a story spanning many countries taking place amid the chaos and maelstrom of a vast civil war, there are many coincidences that take place – all necessary to the story I might add – that find the key characters running into each other at suitably dramatic points of time.<br/><br/>Di Caprio is brilliant, shedding his pretty boy image once and for all as the hard as nails, selfish and opportunistic Danny Archer, Djimon Honsou great as the equally desperate Solomon Vandy, his hoarse scream has quite an impact, and Jennifer Connelly hard nosed and resourceful as a journo who could walk away at any time but chooses to allow herself to become involved in proceedings (she is also still insanely hot).<br/><br/>As mentioned above the action sequences are especially effective and gruesomely realistic, with the wholesale slaughter of anyone in the vicinity being graphically depicted. In fact the attention to detail in what is a vast story is astonishing, every depressing aspect incredibly realistic. There are no short cuts taken in this film.<br/><br/>Add Blood Diamond to Hotel Rwanda, Tsostsi and The Constant Gardener, excellent films that are incredibly hard to watch.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 9 / 10. An excellent film. A depressing portrait of an unfortunate time and place. It is at times hard to watch, which is exactly why you should see it."

","A South African mercenary and a Mende fisherman find their fates forever intertwined as they embark on a quest to obtain a rare and highly coveted pink diamond in director Edward Zwick's frantic adventure drama entitled Blood Diamond.It is a political thriller film co-produced and directed by Zwick that features Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou. The title refers to blood diamonds, which are diamonds mined in African war zones and sold to finance conflicts, and thereby profit warlords and diamond companies across the world.Set during the Sierra Leone Civil War in 1992-2002, the film shows a country torn apart by the struggle between government soldiers and rebel forces.It also portrays many of the atrocities of that war, including the rebels' amputation of people's hands to discourage them from voting in upcoming elections.<br/><br/>Ripped from his family farm and forced to toil away in the sweltering South African diamond fields, Solomon Vandy discovered an extraordinary rough stone of immeasurable value. Danny Archer is a hired gun who specializes in the sale of so-called ""blood diamonds"" that are used to finance rebellions and terrorist organizations, and is currently serving time for smuggling. As a bloody civil war rages in Sierra Leone and Archer learns that Vandy has safely hidden the diamond in a place where no one would ever suspect, the pair enlist the aid of disillusioned American journalist Maddy Bowen in recovering the treasure that has the power to save Vandy's family and provide the desperate Archer with a much-needed chance for redemption.The film's ending, in which a conference is held concerning blood diamonds, is in reference to an actual meeting that took place in Kimberley, South Africa in 2000 and led to the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which seeks to certify the origin of diamonds in order to curb the trade in conflict diamonds.<br/><br/>The film is redeemed by its solid and Oscar-worthy performances as it overcomes poor storytelling with its biting commentary and fine performances.It was excitingly well made but formulaic.It was unfortunate disappointment due to heavy handed direction by Zwick which dilutes its message.Thanks to Mr. DiCaprio's raffishly dashing soldier of fortune, the movie is worth watching despite of its many negative qualities.Overall,it is still a good view but one should not expect a masterpiece out of it."

","I almost never catch these big time films when they make their initial debut, but keep their critical acclaim in the back of my mind when I'm trying to decide on what to watch next. ""Blood Diamond"" grabbed a lot of attention when it came out for it's stars DiCaprio and Hounsou, and I have to say, their team up was one of the more eclectic casting decisions I've come across. It reminded me a little of Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier in ""The Defiant Ones"", and if you think about it, that kind of described the main characters here as they pursue a large rare diamond amid rebel strife in the African country of Sierra Leone. My biggest takeaway from the film was just how brutal and uncivilized life can be in parts of the world we're unfamiliar with while we sit in our comfy living rooms watching stories like this unfold. As far as the action component of this picture goes, it's almost too intense with scene after scene engaging in hostile gunfights and brutal combat. The harrowing family ordeal of Hounsou's character is undeniably overwhelming, and given the odds it's miraculous that he makes it out of Africa alive, especially having found his son already brainwashed by his captors. This won't be a contender for a round the fireplace family movie night, but if you're in the mood for unrelenting action and suspense, you'll get your fill here."

","A fictional story set against a mostly accurate rendering of a civil war in Sierra Leone. All historical ingredients are there: the poorly trained government troops, greedy rebels that don't actually want to take over, mercenary troops ready to kill for the highest bidder, cynical characters but also a handful of those who actually believe in change and truly managed to do something about it. The weak link is, unfortunately, di Caprio. Surely, he is fairly believable as a cynical mercenary who finds redemption in a single act that could be seen as heroic. But at the same time he sinks into a recipe for this kind of character that we can also see in ""Body of Lies"" (tough, cynical but warmhearted guy who keeps adding 'huh?' at the end of every line). Arnold Vosloo, Djimon Hounsou and Michael Sheen steal the show while Jennifer Connely is adequate for her part. There is enough sexual tension between her and Leonardo to underline both their characters' determination to pursue their goals (her story and his escape from Africa's wars). In the end, they all sacrifice something to get what they really wanted."

","Blood Diamond is a fast paced action/drama film that gives you insight where many of the diamonds sold in jewelry are coming from. It focuses on an African fisherman, a mercenary/smuggler and a syndicate of business men trying to match wits over the possession a priceless diamond from a small African country torn by civil war. These diamonds exported from those places are called conflict diamonds or blood diamonds. Leonardo DiCaprio is at the top of his game in this movie. Definitely one of his best roles since titanic. One of the most powerful movies ever made. And last but not least, hands off to Djimon Hounsou. He played his role with outstanding conviction and a lot of heart. One more thing. If you decide to buy diamond jewelry or anything made from diamonds, make sure you ask the clerk, the manager or the jewelry store owner for information about those diamonds."

","Edward Zwick does another brilliant piece of directing in ""Blood Diamond,"" a 2006 film starring Leonardo di Caprio, Jennifer Connelly, and Djimon Hounsou.<br/><br/>Set during the Sierra Leone Civil War in 1999, the film shows a country torn apart by the struggle between government soldiers and rebel forces.[1] The film portrays many of the atrocities of that war, including the rebels' amputation of people's hands to stop them from voting in upcoming elections.<br/><br/>The diamond industry, as the ivory industry before it, is proving disastrous to civilians as the film opens in 1999. When the RUF (Revolutionary United Front) invade Shenge, a small Sierra Leonian village, a man, Solomon (Hounsou) is taken as the rest of his family escapes and made to work in the diamond fields. Diamonds are smuggled into Liberia and exported from there, its profits used by the rebels to fund the war. Solomon's son, meanwhile, is conscripted into the rebel forces and brainwashed, becoming a child killer.<br/><br/>While working in the fields, Solomon finds a large pink diamond and manages to hide it just as there is an attack. He is seen hiding it by the captain, Poison (David Harewood). Harewood is badly injured, but along with Solomon and the others, he is arrested. While in prison, he screams that Solomon has a large diamond. Once out of prison, Solomon is approached by a mercenary (di Caprio) who wants that diamond in order to sell it to a middleman, who in turn will sell it to one of the legitimate cartels. Solomon wants his family. Then they meet a beautiful journalist (Jennifer Connelly) who wants to expose the big diamond cartel as dealing in blood diamonds.<br/><br/>A violent, powerful, beautifully photographed and fascinating story with an extraordinary performance by Leonardo di Caprio, ""Blood Diamond"" leaves little doubt about the greed that has destroyed the lives of so many millions of people. Zwick tells the story graphically. Hounsou, Connelly, Harewood, and the rest of the cast are excellent as people in one way or another caught up in the quest for diamonds, many times in order to just hide them away in order to keep the prices high.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, one of the chirons cautions people to demand that the diamonds they buy are conflict-free.

And I was just blown away by how good it was! The acting is superb,the setting is great,plot is just awesome and don't even get me started on the effects for the battles as they were just great.I absolutely loved the ending to the movie as the emotions combined with the music and cinematography created a stunning effect.

The cinematography is grand and its almost as if Zwick has painted the scenery to perfection with little falseness and huge positiveness throughout. The characters are slick and emotional adding depth and grander to the overall feel of the movie. The story is set at a break-neck speed but works with building character development as well as being fit into the story.

","Blood diamonds are conflict diamonds being sold by illegitimate rebel groups. Selling of these highly sought gems is a huge business for RUF, a rebel group fighting against government in Sierra Leone civil war.<br/><br/>It's hard to describe the way this film manages to touch a viewer like me from a ""rich"" western nation. There are child soldiers with AK's shooting people at random, cruelty, poverty and misery, and to give it contrast, spectacular outdoor shots of majestic Sierra Leone landscape with canyons and jungle. This is a story about people amid civil war, and their search for things they value the most, whether it is diamonds, family or sheer excitement.<br/><br/>""Let's hope they don't discover oil here. Then we'll have real problems.""<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, white African diamond smuggler. This is without a doubt one of DiCaprio's best performances, right after unforgettable Jack Dawson in Titanic, and rugged undercover cop in Departed. Danny gets a hint of an enormous diamond hidden in jungle, and is willing to risk his future in search of this gem sought after by many dangerous people. Danny is a former mercenary, and is more than capable of taking care of himself amid the civil war turmoil. He is accompanied by Solomon Vandy (played by Djimon Hounsou), a local searching for his family and Maddy Bowen (played by Jennifer Connelly), an American journalist.<br/><br/>Hounsou with his strong physical appearance is solid actor, and Jennifer Connelly while a bit stiff still plays an OK role as an idealistic American journalist in search for a touching story.<br/><br/>""Sometimes I wonder if God will ever forgive us what we've done to each other. Then I look around and realize God left this place a long time ago.""<br/><br/>The grim pictures of a white man shooting down Africans are sure to bear a heavy burden on top of this kind of film. However, DiCaprio is so believable and capturing in his role of sole survivalist, that this is hardly an issue. The script is good, director Edward Zwick gives the imagery and themes appropriate space to sink into viewer's consciousness. Besides bearing the obvious message, the film still manages to be an action film enough."
"emuir-1","9","2","2","7 September 2007"," Why does it take so long to recognize atrocities?
","We have another film recognizing the atrocities committed in the African continent during the dark ages of violence and war which has followed the collapse of colonial rule. The massacres, ethnic cleansing and general upheaval, not to mention the general breakdown of law and order which have taken place in Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, the Congo Republic, Rhodesia and Dafur, just to name a few, are only now becoming exposed via the medium of film. This film is a must see along with Hotel Rwanda and The Last King of Scotland.<br/><br/>The savage conflict in Sierra Leone, once part of Britain's West African colonial empire, with its forcible recruitment of child soldiers and killing and maiming of tens of thousands by lawless gangs of self appointed rebels and freedom fighters was reported at the time, but largely ignored by the rest of the world until several years had passed and it was safe to make a film about it. As they said in the film, TIA - this is Africa! Wrong - this is the chaos that follows when a superpower's imposed rule ends leaving behind a power vacuum. <br/><br/>The most interesting parallel in the film was that of the child soldier Dia, and Danny Archer, himself a child soldier, albeit a white one. Danny's parents had been murdered in the struggle in Zimbabwe, after white colonial rule had ended with a unilateral declaration of independence. Danny joined the army in South Africa and served in Angola, where he became a trained killer under the guidance of Colonel Coetze, just as Dia comes under the guidance of Colonel Poison. Neither Coetze nor Poison care about their young proteges, except for tuning them into emotionless killing machines. Coetze is now involved in diamond smuggling, and Danny is one of his field contacts.<br/><br/>Danny courts Solomon, who discovered and concealed a valuable diamond, because he wants to find and make money from the diamond. Solomon's search for his son is an distraction that he does not have time for. He meets the reporter, Maddy, and his reaction is that of a droplet of water in a hot frying pan, but eventually his eyes are opened and he comes to see how they are all being used by the diamond cartel, who do not even sell the diamonds which have destroyed so many lives, but lock them away in a vault to manipulate the price. The film also makes the point that we all contribute to the violence and slave labor when we buy the product.<br/><br/>The ending of the film offers hope for Solomon and Dia, but none for Danny who has not known anything but war and probably could never settle down to a quiet life."

The sounds and visuals are also brutally realistic.<br/><br/>Atmosphere: 6/10 The atmosphere of the film is great at times but at other times falters. Though the yellow and orange color use is very effective in parts, it sometimes glamorizes the scenes rather than makes them real. In ""Hotel Rwanda,"" there is always that sense of desperation and realism, but here it only appears at certain times, and would be appropriate if used more often. The score was also not incredibly strong, and seemed to fail at manipulating emotion in any way.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 7/10 ""Blood Diamond"" is not incredibly well edited. I have no problem with long films, but I don'yet know that this one needed a 2 and a half hour run-time.

","My friends kept telling me how good this was, so I finally checked it out. This was really good. It concerns Sierra Leone in a time of unrest and the illegal export of diamonds. One very rare pink diamond, the blood diamond of the title, is the catalyst that brings a smuggler, a local, and a reporter together.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives a terrific performance in this, is there a better actor in the world under forty? DIjimon Hounsou is equally impressive and Jennifer Connelly, looking great as she did in the old days, is good to. The move is not usually my type of thing and it is very violent. However thats probably necessary in a film like this. Director Ed Zwick (Legends of the Fall, Glory) keeps things moving fairly well and the film manages to make you think and care about he people. No easy feat, the characters, with the exception of Solomon (Hounsou) are out for themselves. Also in this cynical age it takes some creative dialog to get to you. Blood Diamond accomplishes this quite well.<br/><br/>The film delivers a powerful message without being preachy and the film deserved the accolades it received. kudos to all involved, a great film."

It takes place during the infamous civil war of Sierra Leone. Men who don't give up the diamonds are killed. But he stumbled upon a gigantic diamond. Luckily, an attack happens at the same time, so he's able to safely bury it. Through multiple events, a diamond smuggler (Dicaprio) finds out about the diamond, wants it for his own reasons, and forces Solomon to lead him back to where he buried it. All Solomon really wants is to find his family, and he needs the Diamond in order to make an exchange.<br/><br/>I can say that I think Djimon Hounsou may have given one of the best performances of the year. It's a shame he got snubbed. I also enjoyed the juggling of action and drama. Edward Zwick is probably the best at making a movie have good action scenes, and also be plot driven. The Last Samaraui is okay, and Glory is amazing.<br/><br/>I also did like the whole relationship between Leonardo Dicaprio and Djimon Hounsou. Unlike most films, where two enemies traveling together become friends, these two still dislike each other, a more realistic portrayal.<br/><br/>While overall it is a decent movie, I did walk away with one complaint that almost ruins the movie. First of all, Jennifer Connelly is an unnecessary addition only for the romantic plot. The romantic plot is unnecessary and has nothing to do with the story. I would have left her out completely.<br/><br/>I also would have narrowed down the number of lucky breaks. In the film, a lot of times the characters survive because they get lucky. Luck is used accidentally too much in films. The only film that does it well is Match Point, which is about luck.<br/><br/>Anyway, it is a good film, not perfect, but it is interesting to watch."

Di Caprio keeps mastering his acting, playing a difficult role of a mercenary that works for this dark business, and he has to show a hard, ambitious and poor of ethic character, and evolve to the opposite, finding ethics, courage and a good and human man.

"MOscarbradley","8","2","2","15 March 2007"," A nail-biting action movie with a message thrown in
","Edward Zwick's film is that rarest of rare beasts, a genuinely exciting action movie with a social conscience that is neither exploitative nor unduly sentimental. At times it is quite the equal of ""Under Fire"" and ""The Constant Gardener"", one set in Nicaragua, the other, like this, in Africa but all dealing with conflict in the Third World.<br/><br/>There is no doubting Zwick's message and the contempt he feels for regimes that allow children as young as ten to train as soldiers and to kill without conscience as much as for the diamond companies in the West that trade in blood diamonds. But Zwick is canny enough to adhere to that old axiom that if you want to send a message use Western Union. Audiences need action and a bona-fide star and here they get both.<br/><br/>At times the violence is excruciating but the action sequences are nail-bitingly good, (and sometimes stomach-churningly real), pitching the audience right in there with documentary-like precision. He never shys away from the horror of what is happening while keeping things at a very high octane level.<br/><br/>As for that bona-fide star, Leonardo DiCaprio just seems to get better with every movie. His diamond smuggling Danny Archer is no conventional hero, (once upon a time he might even have been the villain), and the script doesn't really give him a lot to work with, but it's a tremendous piece of acting all the same. Arguably it is the most lived-in DiCaprio performance yet.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it's hardly innovative. (DiCaprio joins forces with an African mine worker to retrieve a massive uncut diamond which the mine worker has secreted away in the jungle and which he hopes to use to rescue his family who have been taken by rebels while DiCaprio wants the diamond for himself). However, the plot is only the lynch-pin for this powerful indicement of Third World conflict and Western greed. That the African mine worker is played by the great Djimon Hounsou adds considerably to the proceedings. He lends the film a grace-note it might otherwise not have had."

","Here we have Hollywood's newest addition to the agenda driven film, trying to get people's attention to the plight of Africa. The trailers had me intrigued, but the press stemmed much of that anticipation as most I heard talked about how preachy the movie was, with its only concern being to show Americans the death and destruction that went into their precious engagement ring. I am a big fan of the three principal actors, however, and I tried to leave all the critic's words home when going out to see Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond. Thankfully I did, because if I listened to the hype, while some being true about its' purposes, I would have missed one of the best directed and acted films of the year.<br/><br/>Similar to last year's The Constant Gardener, Zwick has given us a story about family and sacrifice to mask the underlying theme of exposing the inhumane activities going on inside, in this case, Sierra Leone. While I felt the former film succeeded immensely in veiling its true purpose with a heart-wrenchingly emotional tale of love and faith, the latter tries to do the same, but at certain moments fails. Between the middle of the film, when the main characters discuss what they know about diamond smugglingall generalities they both know already but speak aloud for the sake of letting us the audience in on the atrocitiesand the tacked on epiloguewhich subverts much of the beauty the final scenes before it brought, and serves as what looks like just a means to get Michael Sheen some dialogueI did find myself shaking my head at how heavy-handed the film was at times. I think these moments stuck out most because the rest of the film, the telling of Solomon Vandy's search for his refugee family, was so effective that it overshadowed all the message delivery devices. You really feel for the plight of Vandy and for both Maddy Bowen and Danny Archer as they try to put their professional lives on hold long enough to try and do good for their new friend and for themselves.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, as Archer, continues to get better and better with each role he gets. An actor that has always impressed me, much of his past work, while effective, has given off an air of boy in man's shoes. DiCaprio looks younger than most characters that he portrays and as a result comes off as unbelievable no matter how well he encompasses the role. An example of this would be The Departed from earlier this year. True I have Tony Leung's spectacular performance in the original film to compare it to, but Leo just seems out of his element at times, not quite yet realistic as a seasoned tough guy. His portrayal of Danny Archer, however, blows the doors off that generality because he truly embodies this character and feels like the 31 year old that has served in the military, been kicked around for years, and recently held in prison for smuggling. Between his first scene trying to see the main guy in charge to sell his guns and the powerful speech with Vandy about baboon hunting among other things, I was completely riveted by the job he did. Also, the accent stays solid throughout and seems natural enough to suspend disbelief that this is an American playing an Afrikaner.<br/><br/>There must also be mention of the two other leads that successfully embody their roles. Jennifer Connelly is always solid and one of the best character women working in Hollywood today. Her facially expressions and body language are perfect as the strong reporter looking for the story to break the blood diamond case wide open. I credit Zwick as well for his directing the relationship between her and Archer. The sexual tension is there as well as the comradery needed between them. Their characters never break from who they are in order to enjoy a quick tryst amongst the carnage, they are totally creatures of their past. Our third lead, Djimon Hounsou, carries the emotional barometer here as he usually does. Like DiCaprio, Hounsou continues to grow as an actor and is steadily becoming one of the best in the business. After his debut in Amistad, without yet really knowing English, he had his true breakthrough in In America. He is so real and true in his performances, that you cannot help but pull for him to get through all that the world throws at him.<br/><br/>It is true that the moments of preaching took a little away from the film and at times halted the brisk pace in order to give exposition into the diamond trade; exposition that is ultimately unnecessary in the larger story being told. The film is about civil war and three people caught up in the middle of it trying to find a way out that serves each of their needs. It is their survival that the audience gets caught up in, and not the reason the war started in the first place. Zwick shows a deft hand at filming wartime explosions and chaos. I have not yet seen Glory, but there are many moments here that bring to mind his last film, The Last Samurai. Besides the jarring camera-work and brutality that he is unafraid to show, there is also a parallel arc between our hero there and of Danny Archer here. Both films are about a man who has endured a tough life and learned to build a wall around his heart. As a character in Blood Diamond says though, all men may or may not be evil or good, however, they are all people. It may only take one moment to finally live the life they have always wanted, and the path to that moment doesn't always end up being nice."
"pyrocitor","10","2","2","23 December 2006"," Intense and emotionally flooring from start to finish
","It's easy to be deceived by the marketing for a movie such as Blood Diamond. While it may have been presented through movie trailers, publicity material and the like as a standardised Hollywood suspense movie, complete with Leonardo DiCaprio and the like... do not be fooled into thinking that is all Blood Diamond boils down to, because there is so very much more to it than that. In essence, the movie seems to be the amalgamation of two or three films shoved together into one - the intense, emotionally draining story of the Sierra Leone atrocities, the political story showing the futility of so much bloodshed over simple stones, and of course the suspenseful adventure movie, but one far more genuine and emotionally gripping than we have seen for years. <br/><br/>The thing which really sets Blood Diamond apart from most other movies with similar subject matter is the way that the content is presented. Rather than a borderline propaganda film harping on our sense of guilt, trying to get us to get us to send a cheque, all of the horrendous events shown detailing the Sierra Leone crisis are portrayed in a relatively impartial yet brutally unflinching fashion. In this aspect, Blood Diamond is by far one of the most upsetting films of the past several years simply because it doesn't turn a blind eye to the horrifying massacres - expect to see entire families getting brutally gunned down for no reason at all, limbs being chopped off innocent people unlucky enough to be caught, and children wielding firearms, grunting in the fashion of bloodthirsty adults. <br/><br/>Some viewers have complained that the intense violence especially concerning children was almost exploited, a sort of cash in for our entertainment. I disagree; the violence was incredibly upsetting, yes, but in terms of emotional impact it seemed far more genuine than any relief film or commercial. This is just as meaningful as any other Sierra Leone publicity material, and far more relatable. Simply because the massacres and horribly unjust treatment were shown in such a matter of fact fashion, simply as a fact of life, it drove the emotional resonance home all the more strongly, since the audience is haunted all the more by the knowledge that such atrocities are still going on strong in the world, simply for the sake of our decadence. <br/><br/>Edward Zwick, director of the terrific The Last Samurai has produced a film of a similar vein, but is ultimately far superior to any work he has done in the past. The sheer emotional impact of the movie feels like a physical blow to the head, yet one cannot deny, despite the disturbingly brutal content how the film is still an enjoyable thrill ride on the side. How the two can be tacked together is beyond me, but somehow Zwick pulls it off - we are horrified yet elated in turn, all the time drawn in by some utterly gorgeous African cinematography, a tense, exciting score, a compelling and terse script by Charles Leavitt, and of course some incredibly affecting and powerful acting. As a matter of fact, there is only one scene in the entire film which comes across as cheesy or clichéd - there are more which come close, but such fears are alleviated by the superb cast acting at the top of their game. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio has been showing a drastic increase in talent of late, but there can be no doubt that 2006 showcases what is by far the strongest work he has ever put onto a movie screen, what with his work here, and stealing the show with an immensely powerful performance in Martin Scorsese's The Departed. DiCaprio makes the role of jaded and cynical diamond smuggler Danny Archer his own, nailing the south African accent, and completely immersing himself in his character, and never once letting any trace of himself save his charismatic and flooring performance through, making it impossible to picture any other actor playing the part. Djimon Hounsou impresses similarly with a simply wonderful and haunting performance as fisherman Solomon Vandy, who is taken through indescribable trials and horrifying tribulations, all the time only wanting to use the priceless conflict diamond he hid in a hole by the river to free his enslaved family. <br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly also gives a strong and resonant performance as American journalist Maddy Bowen, a wonderful addition to the film even if she is without question outshone by Hounsou and especially the charismatic DiCaprio. Arnold Vosloo also gives a solid performance as the the military general head of Archer's smuggling ring, and David Harewood makes one of the most horrifying villains of the past few years as one of the Sierra Leone slavers. The terrific Michael Sheen also turns in a tidy little performance as an infuriating buyer of Archer's conflict diamonds. <br/><br/>All in all, Blood Diamond is one of the most powerful and stunningly well done films in recent memory, serving as a superb film on so many levels. Politically resonant, emotionally flooring, and packed with wonderfully genuine yet affecting performances from top to bottom, especially the intensely powerful DiCaprio and wonderful Hounsou. A superb piece of work from start to finish, expect this movie to stay with you for days after its initial viewing. <br/><br/>-10/10"

","War dramas such as 'Blood Diamond' can be some of the most emotive pieces in cinema. The barbaric acts that the people have to endure, the bloodshed and the violence all hit home due to its factual nature, brought to vivid and disturbing life on theatre screens. However 'Blood Diamond' fails to rise into the ranks of 'Hotel Rwanda' and 'Schindler's List'.<br/><br/>Walking out of the cinema I felt no emotion, I just felt as if the movie had come to an end and that was two hours of my life that I had enjoyed, but hadn't in any way had an affect on me. For subject material as disturbing and shocking as Sierra Leone one would most likely be surprised at this comment. The flaw lies in many of the crucial ingredients of film making. The way the story was portrayed is the first flaw on the list. Whilst I felt the director was trying to show what everyday life was like in the region at the time the various shocking elements that were designed to instigate the viewer to drop their mouth in shock were presented badly and almost guiltily I felt that Id seen it before. The characters simply didn't bring it to life, a task hampered by many moments that just felt far too convenient. Picture the three main characters walking over a hill and looking down upon a refugee camp that reaches out to the horizon. Over a million residents, Connolly comments. The three walk up to the fence, arriving in search of Solomon's family. Solomon examines the array of people and lo and behold there is his family. That really is one in a million.<br/><br/>On the subject of characters the next logical step would be to look at the acting. All round it was solid but I felt the source material just held back the actors from really delivering anything powerful. At one moment DiCaprio monumentally jumps out of character suggesting he'll cut a man's face off if he ever goes against him. The next moment they're happily walking across the hills. Continuity in this film was at times jarring, jumping from day to night scenes leaving the viewer wondering what happened in between.<br/><br/>As for structure the film meanders along nicely, intermingled with the occasional action scene that whilst nice to watch will never really get your heart rate pumping. And by the time the films minutes are nearly up we reach the emotional climax that really fails to reach its Everest, we simply don't care enough about the character. The only background delivered was of a childhood, which although surprisingly shocking for a clichéd 'parents were killed scenario' meant nothing on the basis of a script that fell emotionally flat.<br/><br/>'Blood Diamond' did many things adequately but never rose to the heights of a picture that really should have stirred the audience emotions given its notable subject material."

","This site rarely let's me down with it's rating system and with an 8 I was expecting this to be a halfway decent movie but I was wrong wrong wrong. This movie is a huge piece of crap. The characters' forced self-righteous dialog seemed to want to bring respect to the sierra Leone conflicts but that seemed to be in direct conflict with the fact that there are back to back Hollywood style action scenes practically every 5 minutes. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be feeling sorry for people or waiting until the sexual tension in the love interest broke out into a sex scene amid one of the ludicrous shoot-outs that the protagonist couldn't seem to get a relief from. The female news reporter was the biggest piece of crap character I've ever seen written, the hypocrisy in her self-righteous rants in correlation with this movie were too much to handle and thus I could only make it halfway through this garbage before turning it off. Argggh, I haven't been this mad at a movie in awhile, so I guess if you're looking to get angry and watch a bunch of kids party down like it's 1999 with some machine guns then go ahead BUT EXPECT NOTHING MORE!"

","Africa is a really bad place to live, as heroin addicted black rebels kill and rape for a handful of precious pebbles. Luckily the Americans are coming in the shape of a lovely Jennifer Connley in the role of the mouthy naive journalist and Leonardo Di Caprio, ruthless Rhodesian diamond smuggler. Bad boy!<br/><br/>Surprisingly not it is their story, no matter what happens to poor Djimon Hounsou: his village and living destroyed, his family lost in the war and his son kidnapped by hip-hop listening black rebels, all neatly packed within the first 10 minutes of this 3 hours and more, epic masterclass in Cliché'.<br/><br/>""Let's hope they wont find oil here! Otherwise we would be in real trouble!"" Says the mad old man to the extravagantly accented DiCaprio crossing a devastated African village.<br/><br/>About two-thirds into the film, the pressure builds up even more. When it is he again, good old Leornardo, that pulls off a masterful moment of exacerbating emotional puree. It is his confession to big eyed Connely, almost an excuse for behaving badly till then, that his family got killed, his mother raped and his dog tortured with ten hours of compulsory viewing of Patronizing Warner Brothers films.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond opens this week in the UK and watch out, it is here to stay. Nominated to way too many golden globes and little statuettes to mention, Edward Zwick's latest effort is surely well received. Or is it? Yesterday newspapers reported of the angry DeBeers, world leader of the diamond market with 40% of the overall market, accusing the film of bad publicity. Fancy that!

","This is a story that needs to be told, but I am not sure it was necessary to do so through the lens of a misplaced love story. It was one thing for Maggie to give Archer a card and to tell Archer to call. But to say that she has given him her cell, work, and home phone was a bit much. Unfortunately, Maggie exists not just as a love interest but the voice of conscience. That she has to call attention to savagery and exploitation trivializes the politics of the film. More to the point may have been a narrative portraying more of the abject poverty in Sierra Leone and Guinea, as well as the plight of the refugees, orphans, and boy soldiers -- all of which could be understood through the lens of a journalist (not a love interest). If you are interested in an action movie, there was plenty of blowing up of cars and executions. This film was entirely too long."

","If anything, Edward Zwick's latest film ""Blood Diamond"" - yet another commentary on African turmoil, this time focusing on conflict diamonds - presents brutal facts that can make one examine his position regarding consumerism. However, Zwick and screenwriter Charles Leavitt overstate the matter by focusing on too many perspectives and the result is an unfocused narrative with a runtime that feels too long for something that could have used a few minutes less.<br/><br/>Set in 1999, when the Sierra Leone government was in a civil war against the insurgent Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is arrested for smuggling conflict diamonds out of the war-stricken country. Faced with the problem of having to repay Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo) - the South African mercenary supposed to receive said diamonds - Archer, a white former soldier from Southern Africa (Rhodesia, particularly) finds a desperate hope in Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), who he believes has found and secretly buried a hundred-karat diamond deep in the forests. Archer then enlists Vandy's help, along with Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) - an American magazine writer - in acquiring the diamond in exchange for helping the latter find his family earlier separated from him during an RUF raid in their village.<br/><br/>No stranger to movies tackling international conflicts, Zwick succeeds in portraying the brute exploitation of the war-torn country's citizens with graphic shots of sadist chaos reverberating throughout. While it does get a little too patronizing, the film's ambivalence towards the course it should take is its greatest fault. As such, there are times the gunfights and explosions nearly get the better of a script that otherwise feels like a standard action thriller.<br/><br/>Fortunately, some of the featured performances give good enough reasons for one to root for the film's characters. DiCaprio, a lock for various acting awards this season, provides nuance and credibility to his character with another solidly gritty performance. Hounsou in turn manages to garner sympathy for what could have been an archetypal role. On the other hand, Connelly doesn't generate interest as her character is barely defined and her presence is mostly inconsistent.<br/><br/>""Blood Diamond"" is ultimately a fairly solid film. Despite its flaws, the film has the ability to provoke anyone with the brutal nature of its theme. Well, yes, it got me into thinking at times that it could have been better but during the parts that work, it got me engaged nonetheless."
"WriterDave","7","9","17","26 December 2006"," This is Africa?
","An Edward Zwick film always reeks of quality. Think of his ""Courage Under Fire,"" the first big film to address the Gulf War, or the Tom Cruise starer ""The Last Samurai."" Both were very good films, but didn't quite reach the epic status they seemed to be aiming for. Zwick commonly has compelling stories with big stars and a big budget...but his films are always missing that special something--the visceral jolt or that artistic flair that separate the good movies from the great movies. ""Blood Diamond"" tries very hard to be a pulse-pounding and heart wrenching political thriller in the vein of last year's ""The Constant Gardner,"" but in its earnest and noble attempt to bring to life the plight of Africans involved in the mining and smuggling of diamonds, it falls short.<br/><br/>The writers deserve credit for trying to highlight so many compelling tangents of this hot-button story that touches on price gouging, corporate ""funding"" of civil war, enslavement of native Africans in their own land, and the brutal indoctrination of child armies by radical rebel forces. Zwick, always competent staging a tense battle scene and realistic violence, unfortunately directs everything else in a pedestrian manner that hinders the inherent compelling nature of the plot. An uninspired music score and two false endings don't help.<br/><br/>The superb cast helps keep things slightly off kilter and interesting for the audience. Leonardo DiCaprio as the suddenly conscious-stricken diamond smuggler has become one of those uber-stars who is always better than expected in spite of himself. He sports and unidentifiable accent (is it supposed to be a Zimbabwe accent, or someone from Zimbabwe doing a bad impression of a South African accent?) that isn't as nearly distracting as it was in the previews for the film. Following his masterful turn in ""The Departed"", Leo has somehow managed to wipe away his pretty-boy image and become a very reliable man's-man actor-intense and brooding and ready for action. It's also nice to see the stunning Jennifer Connelly in a role other than that of a tortured middle class woman with dark secrets. She's underused here as the wily reporter looking to make a difference with her ""big story,"" but her always slightly subversive line readings are effortlessly enticing, and she's become one of those rare actresses who looks even sexier as she ages. To round out the ensemble, there's Djimon Hounsou, always riveting in his typecast role of a passionate and angry African willing to do anything for his family.<br/><br/>""Blood Diamond"" is ultimately one of those movies that is greater to talk about than actually sit through. It has some fine performances and a compelling story that gives much food for thought, but isn't as well executed as it should be. Like all Zwick films, it has a brain and a keen eye, but its heart seems strangely insincere."

The movie suggests that the fighting is instigated by outside forces that want to control access to certain natural resources, a premise which makes for a good movie. The movie raises certain questions. Is all warfare based on the struggle to control natural resources? Is all warfare a response to market forces that demand certain products and will prompt certain groups to take extraordinary measures to ensure that the needs of the market place are met?

","They say the best way to make people care about an issue is not reporting it in the news, but, sadly, by making a movie about it, with big name stars. However, I found this film a bit too slick and entertaining for its apparent noble intentions. In the end, I couldn't figure if the purpose was to make a film about conflict diamonds in war torn African countries and the plight of the people caught in the middle, in order to raise awareness about the issue, or an entertaining action flick that happens to use the subject of conflict diamonds to seem original and pretend it has a higher standard. <br/><br/>The plot was good and the acting was too (mostly Di Caprio's, who was excellent as the white African rogue mercenary, accent and all, and he sure managed the physical presence necessary for his role - first time I perceived him as a man and not a boy), but the film felt very formulaic and preachy - some of Jennifer Connely's morally superior lines, however true, were mere stereotypes and delivered with such self-righteousness that they sounded downright arrogant. <br/><br/>The characters seemed developed by using ""by the book"" methods that almost destroyed the viewer's chance to bond with them and give a damn about them and their circumstances, had it not been for some really good acting moments. The film was riddled with obvious CGI imagery, mostly in the scenes of violent attacks, which took away from the sense of true drama - the film went for quantity instead of quality, IMO, by cheapening the dramatic artistry into mere dramatic kitsch and ruining the emotional charge of the scene. I think it would have been more effective to resort to less grandiose images of violence, brutal death and destruction, and opt for a smaller scale depiction, by using real acting instead of CGI. <br/><br/>I'd say the intention was good, maybe the director and the screenwriters had a better film in mind, but somewhere, possibly in the producers' offices, someone screwed up what could have been an important film and a good cinematic feature, by turning it into a half-baked schizoid mix between a complex socio-political statement and the typical money-making Hollywood feature. Apparently, Hollywood gives a damn as long as it means making a profit."

","What an unconventional plot! This movie is beautifully scripted, directed, and acted. It possesses within it's fiber all the makings of a truly perennial piece of cinematography. The catharsis effect is unimaginably great. I felt differing emotions such as urgency, remorse, travesty, love, and an everlasting friendship. This is indisputably beyond the pale - it is one of the best movies I have seen in the year 2006.<br/><br/>My only regret, is that I didn't get the 'theater' moment, as I sat in the chair, my eyes glued to the computer, my mind, body, and soul attached to the series of event, that unfolded and those to be unfolded. My heart felt for the characters - albeit the fictional addendum to the plot; to me it was outer-body moment, I was there, I was feeling.<br/><br/>The character Maddie was an interesting one. At first, I felt nothing special about this typical 'journalist role,' who is without mistake or folly, a seemingly beautiful and radiant young lady. However, I felt she was just another pretty face on TV. Indeed, I was wrong. Truly misguided, or was that the intent of the director? - Which further underscores his brilliance. For you see, even if it was unintended that she (Maddie)came off blah and dull initially, the development throughout the film captivated me. I believed her and the story she was selling to the audience.I felt her pain, her desires, and aspirations for a better life. This to me, was authentic and genuine - practically priceless.<br/><br/>Conversely, if indeed the director intended this successive, slow but gradual shift in emotional paradigms - then, he is masterful; making an intentional and climatic build-up. Either way, the character of Maddie was beautifully and meticulously constructed into an object of pure perfection. Her relationship with 'Danny' - the white South African was extraordinarily sincere and unconventional. One can't help if (s)he is endowed with a God-given functioning heart not to gush and glee over the beautify and sincerity that lay in the relationship both in death and life.<br/><br/>The film is also jam-packed with numerous elements of sub-plots, themes, and motifs. Due to the constraints of time and to sustain your interest in reading this post I shall offer a succinct listing of these. Love, manipulation, intra-racial subjugation, and finally, hope. As the credits role, I am left with an emotional conflict between redemption and loss. Two very integral emotions that seems to fill the void that was generated at the movie's beginning and so, I was feed. Not my usual preferred climatic ending - perhaps, some would justly argue - an anti-climatic result. Either way, in this case beauty is not in the eye of the beholder but it lays underneath the curtains of this film. From start to finish it was truly exceptional.<br/><br/>Oscar worthy, absolutely! Insofar as, it could represent a quintessential message of civil war, continental robbery, and destruction that long predicated and marshaled the United Nations' agenda to do exactly what it's doing now; stopping the blood shedding via 'Blood Diamond' or otherwise."

Its nice to see directors like Zwick and a few others step to the plate and not only entertain but teach.....and not the Michael Moore way that is totally self promoting"

","'Blood Diamond' is a very well done movie. There's a good script, good directing and touching acting. Although I do feel that the mini flood of African themed movies in the past couple of years is a bit lop-sided, with most people these days probably thinking of trucks carrying stoned child soldiers when they think about Africa.<br/><br/>Anyways, 'Blood Diamond' is political and dramatic. Maybe at times a little bit to action/entertainment oriented in expense of the political framework. Leonardo DiCaprio reinforces his position as the leading actor of his generation.<br/><br/>The only thing that bugged me was how they had to squeeze in the obligatory love story. But still: 8/10"

","interesting subject. This movie was much better than what I was expecting. Leo Dicaprio is really good in this as well as Djimon Hounsou. Djimon should have won the Oscar for his role. Leo plays Danny Archer, a diamond smuggler, whom has his eye set upon a huge payoff that will help him get out of Africa. He over hears a rebel accuse Solomn Vandy of finding a large pink diamond. Danny persuades Solomon to take him to the diamond, In return Danny helps him track down his family in a refuge camp. Danny also gets help from a journalist whom he has a thing for. There track across country is very dangerous with the rebels every where.<br/><br/>The ending was good. It was how it should be. The movie was action packed but informative about some of the things going on in Africa. One of the most entertaining films of the year.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Highly recommend it."

","A wonderful movie, wish I would have seen this movie earlier! Blood Diamond brought together a variety of different aspects. DiCaprio come thru again for us. You could see his dedication and wonderful acting skills in this film, especially how well he captured the accent and language of the Nigerian / English mix, call Krio. DiCaprio's acting in this role was just fantastic! I really enjoyed how the film addressed the question, 'Are there evil people, good people?'... no, there are just people and their actions really define who they are, and what they do when pressure is applied. The character; Solomon Vandy's family was broken up son was captured.<br/><br/>I also liked the scene where Solomon was in London towards the end of the movie, and stopped to see the diamond necklace in the store front window.... I could just see the despair in his face. He sees the end result of all the fighting, death, and destruction... a piece of jewelry.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie was violent; however it's hard for me to recall a revolution in history that wasn't violent. The violent scenes in the film, were necessary.<br/><br/>Oscar Worthy."

","It's graphic but there's not a clean, nice way to tell a horrific story. It's riveting as well as giving the viewer a badly needed education about the unimaginable atrocities which are an ugly part of everyday life in 3rd world countries. I don't know how factual it is re: conflict diamonds but the movie motivated me to find out. My only real issue with the film was the line ""God left this country a long time ago"". Sounds an awful lot like the line from A Place in the Sun where Bruce Willis says ""God left Africa a long time ago"". Seems to me that the writers could have worked a little harder at being a little more original. Wouldn't something like ""God long ago deserted Africa & her people"" have been more original & just as powerful? I consider this a greater flaw than technical inaccuracies thus 9 stars out of 10."

","In Sierra Leone, there exists diamonds worth a fair amount of money. But they are harvested by slaves and sold to fund genocide. This is the story of one of those slaves, a diamond smuggler (with connections to Belgium, England, And Liberia) and a journalist. Together, they will fight to win a story, a diamond and a family. But sacrifices will be made.<br/><br/>We have an amazing cast, so let me just get them out of the way -- Leonardo DiCaprio as smuggler Danny Archer, Djimon Hounsou as native African Solomon Vandy and Jennifer Connelly as journalist Maddy Bowen. DiCaprio rarely makes bad films, and my unending praise for Connelly is seen in a variety of reviews I've written... this film will be no exception to her glowing track record.<br/><br/>This film has action, suspense and a good story to tell. Like ""The Insider"" (or whatever the tobacco movie is called), this exposes how diamonds come to be on the market. I'd like to say things have improved since the time period shown here (1990s) but I don't know if I believe that. I appreciate the honest portrayal here, not shying away from the violence or the horrible conditions the children go through. Humor is absent, and even romance (which would be so easy to add in) is never at the front of the story.<br/><br/>I don't know how to sell this film other than that: if you care about world events, or care about the fate of innocent people ,you'll care about this movie. Even if you don't want this to be that heavy and just take it as entertainment (which it is on some levels), I think you'll still enjoy it (Jennifer Connelly!). Wish I could say more, but it's a cut and dry case: great movie, worth seeing, check it out."
"marcusedenellis","10","3","4","27 August 2007"," Excellence Out of Africa
","To some, this movie is an un-holy alliance of Hollywood money grabbing white supremacist war mongers, overpaid crap actors and no-nothing politically naive writers. You only have to scan the ""Hated It"" one star reviews to see some of these points of view. There are some particularly bizarre viewpoints out there in the general cinema going populace of the world.<br/><br/>Others, however, have rightly given this movie the acclaim it so richly deserves. It must be incredibly hard to find just the right balance within a script when trying to combine the raw emotional gut-punch needed to convey the central message of a serious movie, whilst still making it entertaining enough to pull in crowds that will help to recover the budget. Edward Zwick and Charles Leavitt, director and writer respectively for Blood Diamond have fashioned a tour de force of film-making that exposes to a wider audience the harsh social and political realities of many African countries. Blood Diamond ranks alongside The Killing Fields in its sterling portrayal of man's inhumanity to his fellow man on an epic scale, whilst still retaining at its core a human interest story that can ground the audience that might be otherwise overwhelmed by sheer and pointless brutality.<br/><br/>The principal leads in Blood Diamond give performances that are both powerful and sensitive as required and special mention must be made for Leonardo di Caprio. Di Caprio is rapidly becoming a cinema great; his on-screen presence commands the film throughout and his acting abilities are rapidly becoming exceptional. Recent movies such as The Aviator and The Departed serve only to confirm this. After all, who is going to argue with Martin Scorcese's view of Leonardo's acting talents? Referring back to the one-star haters of this movie, I cannot understand how people can find fault with his Afrikaans accent, which is superbly judged and studied throughout the running time  if it wavers at all (which I don't think it does) it is worth remembering that he is, after all, an actor putting it on for crying out loud. (Actually, as an aside, I am getting disappointed by IMDb letting through so many ill-conceived and poorly judged two or three line reviews by people who can't even take the time to spell correctly. I thought that there was ten line minimum requirement for review?) Anyhow, I am not going to deconstruct the plot  others have done that here far better than I can. Suffice to say that Blood Diamond fully justifies the praise afforded it, to all parties concerned. It deserves ten stars and will take its place among the pantheon of modern epics that deliver blistering social commentary as well as thrilling spectacle.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!"
"rainynight65","9","3","4","10 July 2007"," Gripping, captivating, tragically sad
","The political movie genre is going through a some sort of an Indian summer lately. Its newest incarnation is Blood Diamond, a violent action flick on first glance, but extremely deep and utterly tragic below the surface.<br/><br/>This is a rare opportunity for non-Africans to get a glimpse on the tragedy of Africa: one of the most beautiful places on earth, exploited for ages by the colonial powers, then ravaged by its own people trying to scrape together whatever the colonialists left behind. The filmmakers have done a great job capturing the twisted situation of this continent. Caps of the beautiful countryside interchange with disturbing pictures of village assaults, child soldiers and bloody violence. Everything is held together by a fascinating and memorable musical score.<br/><br/>The cast is top notch. I was never a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but he has surpassed himself in this movie. He has also undertaken a commendable effort to imitate a Southern African accent, even though he uses phrases like 'huh', 'bru' (South African slang for Brother or 'bro') or 'my man' way too often to sound truly genuine. Benin actor Djimon Hounsou makes a wonderful counterpart to DiCaprio's character, while South African celebrity Arnold Vosloo adds some authentic touches to his own character.<br/><br/>This movie is well worth watching - for its story, for the camera-work, for the scenery and the score - but it is not easy. It stands in line with recent political efforts such as 'Hotel Rwanda', 'Lord Of War' or 'Syriana', and if you have at least one of these in your DVD shelf, you cannot miss 'Blood Diamond'."

Some plot of the movie is really touching, especially the character of the movie Solomon Vandy tries to persuade his son Dia Vandy to put down the gun in his hand. The words that Solomon says to him really touch me. Another plot that touches me is the character of the movie Danny Archer sacrifices his life for Solomon Vandy and his son. When I saw he saying goodbye to them and Maddy Bowen, I felt very sad and it really touched me. I think the movie is an excellent movie, it reflects the society problem of blood diamond. Some people kill others for blood diamond or money. I felt sad after I saw the movie. The film lets me realize that there are many people now suffering from the war of blood diamond. I hope that the blood diamond won't be appeared anymore."

It is the worst humanity crisis since the second world war. Just as Danny Archer mentioned, maybe God left this place a long time ago while the civil wars begun, but as the Kimberly Process was signed by many countries, conflict diamonds had been decreased to lower than 4% of the diamond market. And residents in Africa may have the right to live in a peace world. ""Without love, diamond is just a sparkling stone.""

"Sparrowmaniac","9","3","4","23 February 2007"," Diamonds are Death
","Blood Diamond is one hell of a movie, and I will rate it as a must see.Definitely is the best movie I have seen this year so far, and i felt mighty surprised that the Academy Awards have snubbed this movie in the nominations especially in the best Picture category which I feel it rightly deserves.<br/><br/>What can I say about a movie which revolves around such a sentimental and touching topic ? Illegal Diamond trading in Africa and the civil wars is the primary theme of the movie. The makers of this movie have joined these two ideas and produced a superb script. With some amazing casting, this movie has been brought to life by Mr.Danny Archer and Solomon Vandy. Leonardo DiCaprio seems to be getting better and better with each Academy Awards nomination he collects. This being his third, he is a very strong contender for Forest Whitaker. The character of Danny Archer the shrewd and cunning diamond trader who exploits the system, the government and the poor fisherman, farmers to get the diamonds. But even then late in the movie we find a soft side of him, when he sacrifices his own life to save the fisherman and his son. We find out about his horrific past. Djimon Honsu's portrayal of the fisherman is again superb. The poor fisherman estranged from his family by the war, finds his son taken by the rebels, brainwashed and fighting for them. His wife and daughter in a refugee camp. Jennifer Connelly's character Maddy Brown i again precise. A side character who in turn can do anything to meet her own needs, in this case a story about illegal diamond trading. Blood Diamonds. She unfolds the story about the Blood Diamonds and brings down the entire facade.<br/><br/>Its really hard to tell your feelings for the movie after the end. I for one was at a loss for words. The one scene where, the fisherman is telling his son,""You are Dia Vandy. You are a good boy, who loves soccer and school. I am your father who loves you and is ready to take you back as my son again."" and the son has an automatic trained on him, will surely bring a tear to ones' eye. The background score for this movie was superb. So was the camera work. Some breathtaking footages about raw African beauty has been captured in the movie. An applause for the director for making a movie on this topic. Thank you sir for such a wonderful 2.5 hours experience.<br/><br/>A 9/10 !!!!"
"RResende","7","3","4","20 February 2007"," Opening the window
","I think this is worth watching because something new happened here. Not related to film-making, storytelling or any of those cinematic issues, but because of light and capturing Africa, something the manuals call photography.<br/><br/>Cinematography:. <br/><br/>I'm trying to get to as much of the work of Eduardo Serra as i can. I do believe we are in the presence of one of the most competent and surprising cinematographer's of current times. And here he exceeded my expectations, for a film vastly filmed in Africa: the continent always represented a challenge for artists, above all for the matters of light, color and landscape, unique there. In cinema concerns, ""Out of Africa"" was a bold approach, but in the end very ""washed out"" and empty of emotion. Riefenstahl, herself a master in film debated herself with this fascination in part of her photographer work. None of these or other work was able to become, to my point of view, interesting enough, comparing to what Africa can offer. Recently, ""the constant gardener"" raised the challenge and got closer, but it went too much over top (the cinematographer was south American, he mixed the two continents, i supposed). In the end it sounds pretty much fake. Every cinema photography is by definition fake, but it should strike you as genuine.<br/><br/>Serra is Portuguese. Portugal was all over Africa and South America at certain points of history and in the first case until very recently. Maybe that would give a Portuguese cinematographer the balance and distance he needs. Recently, in an interview, Serra was asked, regarding ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"", how could he have got that light, so natural, so genuine. He simply answered: ""i opened the window."" That's what he made here. He understood the light in Africa, and put all the artificial means he had to bring that light, as untouched as possible, to cinema. So, the merit of this film is, in this sense, to have opened the window to Africa. It's not perfect, but it's the best we have, to this point. Until something better comes out, this is Africa.<br/><br/>My evaluation: 4/5 - just photography (and Conelly, great presence, fills her scenes and in addition is beautiful), for all the rest this is a common, even vulgar experience in mass cinema, not worth more than 2 in my scale. If you want something more clever, by someone who cares about film-making, camera-work and storytelling issues, watch ""the constant gardener"".<br/><br/>P.S. This one is inserted in the recent tendency for commercial movies to look at humanitarian issues, using entertainment as a channel for ""serious things"". I think that's worth of applause only to the point when this becomes another capitalism global product. this ""bono voxization"" of humanitarian issues may kill the hole principle of the thing."
"Weredegu","9","3","4","18 February 2007"," Conflict movie
","Good introduction to one of our contemporary world's most intriguing issues: how natural resources work as a curse for 'developing' countries, and especially for the population of those countries, where they are discovered.<br/><br/>The topic has a rapidly growing scientific literature which has carefully pointed out that politics-wise it actually isn't all the same whether it be diamonds or oil that is found in a land (even though it may be the same for the ones who have their village on the spot). That is perhaps the only thing, however, that this film overlooks to a degree (as documented in some remarks by the characters), but that's rather insignificant and overall the movie does aim to be a careful recreation of the madness of the civil war in Sierra Leone - the very special madness that had a large number of elements to it that can be explained rationally, even if in a twisted way (such as, for example, the amputation of limbs as deterrence of resistance by a guerrilla force that wants to firmly control a vast stretch of the countryside without enough armed men for a full-out occupation of it).<br/><br/>In taking that approach, the film avoids the mistake of starting from a moralizing perspective, and so it doesn't ignore the structural factors playing into what happened. To give you an example, even brutal RUF commanders have well-outlined characters, speak authentically and don't lack at least an excuse for an ideology - you can hear for instance their famous slogan, 'no more slaves, no more masters', that very distantly reminded me of the similar thing communists promised about putting an end to the exploitation of the working class in Eastern Europe, only to then turn into exploiters themselves. So this again shows that in most parts of the world it is just not enough even if you to wish to be a good person, you may still end up not being one. But usually, of course, there is a bandwagon-ful of people lacking any good intention whatsoever willing to go along with any ideology so long as it takes them to power.<br/><br/>It is from this vicious circle that the whole human drama of the story starts. The RUF fighting for control of the mines so they can buy new weapons so they can continue to fight. A fisherman is taken captive by the rebels and only escapes the brutal chopping of his arms because he looks strong enough to do well as a miner (slave) for the RUF. He has to serve his new masters while not knowing if the rest of his family hasn't, or at least hasn't yet, been subjected to the worst possible torture somewhere. Meanwhile the techno-war rages on, drugs help the RUF get a steady flow of child soldiers hold their own in battle (and, mostly, in village massacres). Watch the movie to find out how, out of this situation, a diamond trader entering the scene at one point can become the provider of a ray of hope for fisherman Solomon Vandy. I could say some negative things about the ending, but I won't, out of respect for a mainstream Hollywood movie that dared give a complex treatment to a sensitive issue. To phrase my critique with similar complexity, things are not black and white here - they are dark gray and light gray. There is still room left for some too-easy distinction between shades of gray and for some heart-bleeding stuff, but then this is drama and not a documentary.<br/><br/>In the latter respect, if you'd like me to liken the end result to some other recently made movie about Africa, I'd say it's in the league of 'Lord of War', though somewhat better than that film. It raises an issue that's worth raising, but doesn't do it with the same touch, in my view, that the makers of 'Hotel Rwanda' or 'The Constant Gardener' had. That shouldn't be interpreted as my judgment about the actors, however. Of the three leads, all great, I'll only mention DiCaprio specifically, because of the 'Titanic' syndrome that still continues to cost him. Feel free to forget 'Titanic' if you don't want to remember it. DiCaprio is great here, and I would say that even if he wouldn't speak in 'Rhodesian' and Krio English in the movie. He is just really weirdly credible as a South African veteran turned freelance diamond trader, knowing the moves in a fight, but also already feeling the effect of too much smoking.<br/><br/>One of the pictures that stayed in my mind for a long time is also connected to DiCaprio. It's him carefully listening to his former commander's words on a South African ranch, looking in many ways different from, but in others similar to, the young Dia, the newly trained child soldier, listening to his RUF commander in Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>To finish by something controversial, I'll point to this bunch of teens who were there in the audience when I saw the movie. They were laughing out loud a lot at the sight of violence. I didn't care so much at that moment, but now, coming to think of it, it's just so easy to imagine them turned into psychotic militiamen. Just a little training, you know. They came to watch the movie to see blood. To see hearts bleed literally. For them this was a 'blood movie'."

He excels at being the irresistibly vulnerable antihero you can't help but root for.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly was also perfectly cast and believable as investigative journalist Maddy, and she and DiCaprio acted superbly; too bad they lacked chemistry. The heat between them just wasn't enough to graduate into a sizzle.<br/><br/>Directed by Edward Zwick (Courage Under Fire, Legends of the Fall, Glory, Last Samurai), this pseudo-documentary about the conflict diamond trade in Africa effectively preaches its message while entertaining the audience. However, Zwick lays on the drama too thickly, milking each scene too often, with some sequences running on too long (sobrang babad). After a while, I thought I was watching LOTR or an episode of Lost. While this is a great way to educate people about a cause, nothing new was really given from a film-making perspective. The story unravels in disappointingly safe Hollywood formulaic fashion, a pity when there was so much material, talent and background to exploit further. Still, Zwick manages to arouse enough emotion from audiences enough to make them part with their money for admission, and in that respect, this film is a success."

","For me, there are three stories going on simultaneously in this movie.

Second one is about Leonardo, the soldier, smuggler and the survivor, along with Solomon Vandy, the native, fisherman, and a father, and their search for the diamond and their lives in between. Third is the relationship between Connelly and Leonardo - I don't know if I can give it any name, but I don't think I have ever seen such a powerful unexpressed chemistry between two characters in any other movie (and I haven't seen Casablanca or Gone with the wind). There is no kiss, no hug, not even a handshake, there are just words, there are just unexpressed expressions through the eyes, movements of the throat and thats all you need (just to clarify I am more of a mafia, drama, biopics, history genre kind of a guy) Connelly is as beautiful as she has always been, even in her unglamorous journalistic attire, and is quite convincing in her character (perhaps too good looking). Leonardo is natural self, which means fabulous, may be at par with his Howard Hughes role in Aviator. In all, its a very tightly written gripping script - I watch it every time it is on TV (sometimes just to get to the last scene between Leonardo and Connelly). Pity that it didn't get any academy - I would have expected it to at least win for supporting actor or editing."

","For most of us diamonds are a symbol of status and wealth, but in the countries where they are mined it stands for nothing more than racial oppression and economic exploitation.<br/><br/>Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"" is a blend of gripping drama and frightening reality that captures the conflict for the possession of precious stones.It is an edge-of-the-seat action thriller with morality as its subtext. It's difficult to find a superlative for Zwick's excellent craftsmanship which keeps you hooked till the end.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds you gasp in shock, flinch in pain, shudder at the unrestrained brutality and by the time the movie reaches its climax you are dismayed and disgusted seeing the so-called civilised people losing their sanity in quest for diamonds.It is one of those rare films that leave you satiated but at the same time has lingering effect on the mind. You are haunted by the images of innocent children, who are kidnapped, brainwashed, drugged and forced to take up arms to terrorise and kill people.<br/><br/>You are likely to have an aversion to the precious stones after watching the film.Set in Sierra Leone during the 1990's civil war, it revolves around a diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), an ex-mercenary who can go to any length to possess a pink diamond found by Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsoun), a fisherman.<br/><br/>Vandy is a victim of the civil war carried on by hell-raising rebels executing one of the most brutal military campaigns to make more money for themselves and the so-called sophisticated diamond merchants.During an attack by a rebel group, Vandy is captured and separated from his family. The rebels forced him to work in a diamond field and while digging for the precious stones he finds a rare pink diamond and hides it. But, before he could retrieve the priceless stone, the diamond field is attacked.<br/><br/>What happens after that forms the climax of the film! Performance wise it is flawless! DiCaprio is simply awesome. He has certainly come a long from his days of ""Gangs of New York"". His maturity as an actor is evident in his two back-to-back releases - ""The Departed"" and ""Blood Diamond"".His character has many shades in the film and he excels in each of them, especially in scenes where he brings forth his character's internal conflict.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou as Vandy, one of the many Africans who dreams of a normal life, immensely impresses you with his performance. The chemistry between DiCaprio and Hounsou is indeed a highlight of the film.Apart from DiCaprio and Hounsou, Jennifer Connelly too impresses as a journalist who tries to expose the consequences of the conflict through her write-ups. However, she is aware that it will not have the desired effect on people tucked away in a safe world.<br/><br/>She knows people will read it, discuss it and then go back to their routine lives.There was a lot of hype about Indian actor Gaurav Chopra sharing screen space with Hollywood biggies, but he just has a blink-and-miss role in the film.The director has not only succeeded in extracting the best from each of his actors but has also managed to put across a moral message without making it too preachy and melodramatic.<br/><br/>""Blood diamond"" is a must see."

","Blood Diamond is the latest in a string of recent Hollywood financed films which have taken on political and social turbulence in Africa and is, in my opinion, the weakest. The script was deeply conflicted about whether the film's main role was as an action film or a political film, and ended up failing as either. The political message, though interesting, was sloppily handled, leading the audience to be angered not by the American and Europeans who control the Diamond business, but by the campy and stereotypical African villains. I felt little pity for the civilian populations, who were made entirely one dimensional and were almost entirely cursory to the main storyline. The exception to this was Honsou, a revelation and easily the highlight of the film. He was compelling to watch, and will hopefully be seen again. DiCaprio wasn't so inspiring. Aside from the fact that he's just too baby-faced to play the tough guys he's been cast as recently, here he was simply dull to watch. Angry, disillusioned and completely lacking in any depth. His chemistry with Connelly was nonexistent. The cinematography was nice enough, but all the action scenes felt overblown and badly handled, and what was really surprising was the complete lack of any feeling of place. There was a village, an urban center, and some fields , and as far as I could tell they were all withing a few miles of each other. All in all, the usual disappointing Hollywood stuff, this time with an important but terribly executed message, made slightly better by one sterling performance. My advice would be to watch the infinitely better and truly touching The Constant Gardener."

"ShabbadooGirl","2","24","61","1 December 2006"," Ed Zwick is one sensitive white man.
","With a title like Blood Diamond, you'd assume we'd be talking about an action picture - the film does have some violence, but not enough to warrant an entry in the genre. The picture is instead about diamond harvesting/smuggling in the late 1990s, amidst the chaos brought on by murderous jewel-hunting rebel forces in Africa. Djimon Housou plays Solomon Vandy, a family man who must succumb to the murderous rebels in order to spare the lives of his loved ones. While being forced to work with the rebels in their quest for jewels, to be exported to serve mostly rich westerners, he finds rare diamond - one that is pink, clear, and worth a hell of a lot of money. Unfortunately, one of the rebel leaders knows what Solomon has found, but he is unable to acquire the stone from Solomon, due to an ambush on their camp. Luckily, Solomon hides the stone in the dirt off the banks of a river- And as you'd assume, the climax of the film happens there, in one of many predictable moments brought to the screen in this despicable, two-hour inspired-by-true-events motion picture.<br/><br/>I use the word ""despicable"" to describe this film because almost everything in this film is strategically placed to work our emotions. You might think that this wouldn't be a bad thing, but the way that Director Ed Zwick plays with our hearts couldn't be any more obvious nor laughable - in order to help us realize the severity of the violence and the dastardly ways of the rebels, we see innocent people have their limbs removed, be pumped full of bullets, or cry in pain for all the suffering they experience. Piece by piece, this film unfolds, with every moment becoming more calculated than the other. Thankfully, Leonardo DiCaprio shows up to give one of the worst and most annoying on-screen accents in recent history - but isn't he supposed to be South African? Sure, believe that if you want- it's still not tolerable for 130 minutes. Jennifer Connelly plays the lovely (but really concerned!) journalist Maddy Bowen, who meets DiCaprio's manipulative Danny Archer to spew fightin' words at each other to explain their separate causes - there's some chemistry between these two, since they are both straight single adults of opposite genders, and it's rather painful to watch. They both convince Solomon Vandy to go along with them through Sierra Leone and elsewhere to save his family (so he hopes)- Connelly's journalist Maddy Bowen may want just the journey, which will give her a story and some nice pictures, while DiCaprio's Danny wants that damn stone. <br/><br/>The more Blood Diamond advanced, the less and less I cared about the issue- seeing Solomon cry in front of his wife and children at the fenced-in camp where they are held, while Maddy Bowen snaps photos of their sadness, as well as the many other young victims who have lost their limbs to the rebels, is a prime example of the intent of this picture- these people are suffering and dealing with pain, while the non-victims stand back and examine for their benefit. It's quite fitting that Ed Zwick would continue his ""cultural issue film starring a white man"" saga with this devastating and cliché melodrama, which ends with a demise for DiCaprio reminiscent of his freezing near-death state towards the conclusion of Titanic (except this time, it's really funny, and our hearts ""won't go on""). Connelly is basically here to support and give face, while Leo has to be the bad guy who wants to do good, as long as he gets something in the end. Only Hounsou's Solomon Vandy is the true winner in this film, with a storybook ending that will make you stand up and cheer (not because of a fitting resolution or the quality of the movie- the filmmakers want you to, dammit). I still can't exactly explain how much I hated this movie without resorting to expletives.<br/><br/>Movies like Blood Diamond are what make me hate Hollywood - the abuse of problems in Africa for use as an issue film (sort of like Tears of the Sun and The Constant Gardener- which are both better films) is becoming extremely tired. And for what cause, if there is any (besides making diamond owners feel guilty)? Consider the release date. Djimon Hounsou will be up for the Best Supporting Actor prize without much effort, since this is awards season. If the film industry is going to churn out movies about problems in the world, they could at least make them not feel like opportunistic garbage."
"poojucu","10","6","11","8 January 2007"," Solid movie, with some excellent performances
","Africa is a war torn country. Over the past century it has been plagued by minor and major conflicts, some which are still apparent today. Creating a film that is set and based upon such events is both risky and sensitive, but Edward Zwick once again fronts old critics with an engaging, dramatic, enlightening and overall a very entertaining experience. The story basically revolves around Danny Archer (Learnado Di Caprio) a diamond smuggler who learns of a diamond which has been buried by an African fisherman Solomon Vandy. Solomon agrees to show him the where abouts of the 100 carrot diamond in return for some help in finding his family. However in a country which is seriously ravaged by war and poverty this is no easy task. It was good to see that Blood Diamond is not scared to portray the realism of living in Africa in that time. While violence and gore is strong in this film it is certainly not over the top, which for many people will be a welcome change. <br/><br/>The performances in this film was the main highlight for me though. While Di Caprio outdoes himself and excels as the aggressive, and also at times sensitive smuggler. Djimon Hounson is the main star. His performance was uplifting, strong and very convincing. <br/><br/>There is very little negative feedback I can say about Blood Diamond. Perhaps there are some unconvincing moments involving Solomon Vandy and maybe at times the term "" Hollywood "" could be used but overall this is a very good film. Good writing, excellent performances, lots of action, an enthralling storyline, and Learnado Di Caprio with a awesome accent makes this a certain Oscar nominee."

","My best friend, The Lord Mighty Hofer, Mr Jerome Jeangirard, my cinema going brother in arms said to me after this terrible film that if you cant feel anything for the characters its because they are plastic, fake and utterly unconvincing on screen. I was never a great fan of Dicaprio and his pretty boy image but he blew me away in The Departed, I would go as far as to say he was a revelation in it. It is beyond me how he has been nominated for an Oscar for this role! The film was like an open book, we read it from start to finish. Yet again Hollywood produces an action film with serious undertones. The problem is in doing so the Director has managed to insult the intelligence of the audience and Africa as a whole. The problem in todays society is that people don't read enough and aren't particularly interested in what's going on outside the bottom of their popcorn box and so films like Blood Diamond just add to the stereotypical image we have of the third world. The worst part is that having done that the face of the western world is given a nice tidy conscience, the problem is that it just couldn't be further from the truth!"

","Not bad, but definitely not a great movie. For a movie that is supposed to be a drama, this had a lot of over the top action sequences. DiCaprio's character's accent was not believable, and Connelly's character altogether could have been cut from the film. Felt like the film was lecturing us for being bad people, as if the moviegoer was the one actually cutting off the hands of innocents. If the entire story had centered around DiCaprio's character, it would have been much better, and the movie would have benefited from a bit of subtlety to get its more tragic messages across, instead of coming across as a preachy film about evil greedy westerners."

","First, let me comment on the ratings skew given to movies by ""Astroturfing"". When a movie is released, industry shills assault supposedly impartial rating sites in an effort to adjust public perception. And IMDb is a prime target for such faux reviews.<br/><br/>As I write this, Blood Diamond appears to be an epic of the decade with a 8.2/10 average score. At the moment, calling this movie anything less than artistic perfection would seem to be the minority opinion. Help 'weed out' the astroturfing, watch this movie for yourself and rate it appropriately.<br/><br/>In my opinion this film is good, but not exceptional. Blood Diamond trips slightly on its own ambition. We have too many mixed themes that won't quite blend together into greatness. Some schizophrenia as to whether this movie wants to be a reality based drama, or an action flick spoil the final brew.<br/><br/>I generally enjoy DiCaprio's work, but his role and dialogue seem a tad forced in this setting.<br/><br/>I *do* like the movie. It tackles a thorny subject with zeal, and may open some eyes to the darker aspects of a commodity market.<br/><br/>This movie can be enjoyable, thought provoking and entertaining, as long as you aren't expecting authentic cinematic gold from it."
"mgould23","1","22","57","8 February 2007"," Overlong and total Hollywood trash
","The cinematography is great, but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just ridiculous. The story is just so far fetched it is almost comical. DeCaprio and co, managing to escape endless bombs and about two million machine gun bullets while every part of their vehicle was hit a million times, they came out unscathed. Surrounded by savages, the Connelly character saves them from certain death with holiday snaps with natives. Carry on up the jungle. <br/><br/>Leo's attempt at a South African accent is just terrible, if he had a voice coach on this film, the guy should have been fired. Jennifer Connelly is just added eye candy, but the real bummer is the boring script. I fear Leo has learnt little from acting alongside some of the greats. He isn't ever going to be in the class of Robert De Niro or Daniel Day Lewis, on his performance in Blood Diamond he seems more in the Ben Affleck division. <br/><br/>The makers are out to please the youth and maybe this tosh will, but as far as being a good film worthy of Oscars, it stinks. If it does get any awards it will just go to show how money has replaced any form of art to the the Academy, but we already know that.<br/><br/>I was so disappointed with this film I actually walked out after almost two boring hours and didn't wait for the ending."

","As with several other recent ""acclaimed"" movies that I've seen (e.g. Casino Royale, Borat) this movie was disappointing. No, more than disappointing, it was just aggravating. The little polemics that Zwick inserted throughout the movie were obvious and lame, which rendered the dialog plain embarrassing, and which caused the actors to look blatantly embarrassed, with good reason.<br/><br/>Moreover, the whole black man/white man partnership has been rendered well in many movies, but in this, I found the ""partnership"" was condescending and patronizing towards the black side of the coin. It's not something unique to white film makers - some of Spike Lee's movies, for instance, are equally patronizing to other races - but it's still cringe-worthy, no matter where it comes from.<br/><br/>The ending was enormously predictable, although even I didn't predict that it would be so drawn out and, once again, lame. How did Di Caprio get acting nominations for this? He made one truly great movie (What's Eating Gilbert Grape) and has been struggling ever since."
"Eat1","3","15","38","3 December 2006"," Another film with potential shafted by lazy writing
","The first indication that something went very wrong at the screenplay stage in Edward Zwick's new film Blood Diamond occurs around the twenty minute mark, when Leonard DiCaprio's character is asked, ""How long have I known, you, Danny?"" Attention, anyone with even a vague interest in film: this is poor screen writing. There is no quicker, more dependable indication of a lazy, sub-par writer than this little ditty, which appears in an astonishing number of very bad scripts. It is a writer saying, in essence, ""I cannot be bothered to think of a way to impart this information in natural, conversational dialog, so I will simply have one character ask another character something that no human being would ever say to another, because I have total contempt for my audience."" Because, really, why would any person ever ask another person how long they'd known each other? Don't they both know? The screenplay is again the downfall of a film with potential in Blood Diamond. It is not quite as bad a script as the one that Emilio Estevez slapped together for Bobby, but it's a photo finish. Estevez' scenario was full of one-dimensional characters and bland, clunky exposition, but there was a little bit of color and voice to at least some of it; Blood Diamond plays like a filmed outline. The film is built around the germ of an intriguing idea, and everything follows a fairly logical progression, but none of it happens in a particularly interesting or memorable way.<br/><br/>DiCaprio stars as Danny Archer, a smuggler and hustler who overhears a holding cell confrontation between a rebel soldier and Solomon (the reliably soulful and effective Djimon Hounsou), a diamond field worker who has hidden a huge, uncut stone in the jungle. Solomon was taken from his family by the rebels and only wants to find them; Archer wants the stone, and figures they can help each other out.<br/><br/>There's also the predictably hot American reporter (Jennifer Connelly), who pops up every once in a while to engage in political arguments with Archer and provide him with an uninteresting pseudo-romantic subplot. There's a lot of talk in Blood Diamond-- about Africa and the diamond trade and working for change and American complicity and so forth, and there are two problems with all of this talk. The first is that these lengthy political discourses are usually followed by a car chase or a shoot-out, and the two mix uneasily. The second is that when people have these conversations, they turn into mouthpieces; nothing is less entertaining (or interesting) than A Film With An Agenda, and when a writer is not clever enough to engage in subtext and instead has every character constantly represent exactly What They Believe, then we're veering into Crash territory.<br/><br/>The structure is less than perfect; the film takes entirely too long to get going (and at 143 minutes, it overstays its welcome considerably), and it arrives at what looks, feels, and should be an ending before going on for at least ten more minutes with an entirely unnecessary epilogue (though said epilogue does give us the required moment where the journalist, seeing a private, personal moment, puts down her camera to keep from exploiting her subjects. Shattering stuffback in the 80s, when we first saw it).<br/><br/>However, Blood Diamond is not altogether unsuccessful. There are some moments of real power (though they are fleeting), and however incongruent the action sequences might be, they are well-staged and shot by director Zwick. Connelly does reasonably well with her poorly developed role (no talented actor should be saddled with her stump speech on what it is to be a journalist), and DiCaprio is refreshingly effective as a scumbag (though his accent is a tad dodgy, and his third act change-of-heart is entirely out of nowhere, even by Hollywood standards).<br/><br/>So, yeah, even what works requires qualifiers. And the film's successes are shattered by the laugh-out-loud moment in the end title cards where the audience is informed that these ""conflict diamonds"" still make their way, in spite of legislation to the contrary, into America, so (and I'm quoting here) ""it is up to the consumer to insist that diamonds are conflict free."" By that point, I was expecting MacGruff the crime dog to pop in and encourage us to take a bite out of exploitation.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond is reasonably well-made, and as well-acted as can be expected. It is not bad in any particular way, or in any particularly aggressive way. It is just sort of bland and uninspired, and there are too many fine films in theaters now to kill two and a half hours with this one."

","Sometimes good intentions aren't enough to make for a good movie. It takes good writing, acting and directing as well. ""Blood Diamond"", with the exception of the acting skills of Djimon Hounsou, was a rare confluence where bad writing, directing and acting produced a foofer.<br/><br/>An unnecessary love relationship between Leonardo DiCaprio, a seasoned diamond smuggler/soldier of fortune and Maddy Bowen, a freelance journalist, does nothing but distract from what might otherwise have been a good story. DiCaprio's never-ending death scene seals the deal. The audience is left wondering why at least 1 hour of the movie didn't end up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The exception is the fine acting of Djimon Hounsou who plays Solomon Vandy, a father whose family has been torn apart by a civil war fueled by an illegal diamond trade. The one bright spot in an otherwise mediocre movie."
"huntfin","6","6","12","22 March 2007"," two emerging trends in film appear here
","This film brings forth two distinct recent trends in Hollywood large film production with big names and especially those that have some moral implication: the tendency for actors/actresses to have undue influence on their role and the similar strive for innovative approach to moral issues. Distracting, is the overt ""influence"" that Dicaprio and Connelly have on their roles. This detracts from the movie as they appear to have invented the roles and lines themselves, separate from putting their own spin on a role. The well carried and well spoken Maddy as played by Connelly, who would rather run from gunfire than drink latte's, is able to maintain a hygiene and attractiveness as a journalist, unlike the role of humanitarian worker. Dicaprio plays yet another role(Danny) where the peak of his introspective/moralistic/philosophic thinking during likely his ""off time"" is displayed through his acting profession and in effect on screen by wooing another women -It never fails (titanic, departed, blood diamond come readily to mind); epitomizing this claim and with Hollywood's continuous search for new screenplay endings, his dying words to Connelly attempt at encapsulating a potential lifelong relationship into ""I'm glad to have met you."" It feels as if Dicaprio either wrote his lines or pretends psychologically to have come up with them himself, this is not to be confused with good acting. Though the South African accent is very tough and he assumes it well despite the popular contrary opinion. Hounson, the uneducated yet wise savior in the end (Solomon), as with his prior claim to fame, postures in the courtroom. The attempted refugee and then captive worker is pigeonholing himself into the title of screaming / crazed hero. Apart from the stars, it is the spreading of the true story of Africa that wins, right? We guess, yet the spreading of such word will never stop the demand for diamonds; it may even strengthen it according to the reasoning in ""Freakonomics,"" for the film appears to take on the role of informing those who would never inform themselves."

","""To tear treasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire, with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into a safe."" Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness <br/><br/>In West Africa's Sierra Leone, 1999, anarchy ruled, best symbolized by civil war and diamond lust. Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond touches all the incendiary bases: towns pillaged for young boys to be recruited for rebel armies, big diamond firms manipulating the market to keep the price of diamonds high, foreign concerns such as the US walking narrowly between outrage at civil rights violations and interest in the country's vast resources such as oil, rubber, and, of course, minerals.<br/><br/>As in this year's other cautionary slice of African history, The Last King of Scotland (about Idi Amin), Blood Diamond's Africa is ripe for maniacal dictators and white exploiters, be they international or South African. Zwick captures the ironic beauty through visually stunning landscapes juxtaposed with close up shots of poverty and mayhem, not all related to diamonds, but all certainly connected to natural riches incapable of being protected by an impoverished, illiterate citizenry.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio's David Archer, from Zimbabwe (Rhodesia as he still calls it), deals in diamonds, a savvy young entrepreneur dedicated to gaining a 100 carat ""pink"" diamond discovered by native laborer Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou). Vandy needs to barter the discovery for the return of his enslaved family and a chunk of money. Archer's adventure dominates the film to the detriment of closer looks at devastating issues such as child soldiers, of which there are an estimated 200,000. Vandy's son is one of those, so Archer becomes involved by virtue of the diamond and his own emerging altruistic inclinations.<br/><br/>Archer's budding love for Jennifer Connelly's journalist Maddy Bowen reminds me of Rick and Ilsa from Casablancalove requiring sacrifices during war, issues bigger than the two of them, blah, blah. So Blood Diamond turns on love after all, both for a land and a people. If Zwick had stayed longer with the big issues such as politics and corporate corruption, his film would have achieved an Out-of-Africa mystique. He does, however, elicit a memorable performance from DiCaprio and wakes us to the politics of diamonds. After all, romantic Americans demand 2/3 of the African diamonds, rarely asking if they are buying ""conflict-free"" gems.<br/><br/>The sometimes Indiana Jones-like Blood Diamond gives little hope there is such a commodity."

The most disheartening thing is that not much is being done about it.<br/><br/>But Blood Diamond does have heart. It has a big heart that refuses to give in to cynicism and despair. It is an ""if only"" film--as in, if only more things this world-changing would happen in real life--yet it is far from being idealistic. Hopefully, everyone who sees it will take it with them long after they leave the theater and will remember it the next time they find themselves eying a diamond in the jewelry store.<br/><br/>As for the actors, Djimon Hounsou shows again what a powerful actor he is, and Leonardo DiCaprio has never been better.

"ackstasis","7","3","5","23 September 2007"," ""That diamond is my ticket out of this God-forsaken continent.""
","'Blood Diamond' is probably most accurately described, first and foremost, as an action movie, with its other well-meaning cinematic intentions not being quite so well-realised. However, as a whole, the film is highly entertaining, and held aloft by two outstanding central performances. During the Sierra Leone Civil War of the 1990s and early 2000s, billions of dollars in diamonds were mined and sold around the world, the profits used to finance further conflict. These diamonds are widely known as ""blood diamonds,"" from which the title of this film was derived. Over the course of the war, tens of thousands lost their lives, and countless more fled the country as refugees.<br/><br/>Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' opens in 1999, revealing a poverty-stricken country that has been torn apart by the bitter struggle between government forces and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a loving father who was captured during the rebel insurgence and forced to mine for diamonds to fund RUF's activities. Meanwhile, his son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) has been captured by the rebels and conscripted to become a child soldier, involving a brutal process of brainwashing that transforms children into bloodthirsty killers. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a ""Rhodesian"" weapons smuggler, devoid of morals and thinking only of his next pay-cheque. After Solomon unearths an extremely valuable pink-tinged diamond, Danny exploits him for the information of its whereabouts, though he isn't the only one who wants to get his hands on it.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, both Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou give excellent performances, and each was deservedly nominated for an Oscar at the 2007 Academy Awards. DiCaprio, notorious for always looking young and immature on screen, finally casts aside this troublesome stereotype as the selfish and grizzled firearms trafficker, accompanied by an unusual African accent that, nonetheless, never falters. Hounsou plays his role of devoted father with a lot of passion, his most impressive scene taking place at the UN refugee camp, when his relief at being reunited with his family turns to unadulterated rage when he hears that his beloved son has been stolen from him. Conversely, Jennifer Connelly is merely adequate as American journalist Maddy Bowen, who has arrived in Sierra Leone to investigate the illegal diamond trade.Oddly, the actress is seemingly trying to appear seductive in just about every one of her scenes, though perhaps this was a deliberate decision to highlight how she uses her ""charm"" to obtain information.<br/><br/>'Blood Diamond' contains some excellent action sequences, but Eduardo Serra's camera darts about so frantically that it's often difficult to decipher what is happening on screen. I felt that the extended ending was unnecessary (it should have ended on the mountainside), and the epilogue seemed like an attempt to make the film appear more significant than it actually was: after all, 'Blood Diamond' was a interesting character study and an excellent action/adventure film, but it says little of any substance about the diamond trade, beyond that it is bad. In any case, the theme of large international corporations getting rich at the expense of poverty-stricken Africans was handled slightly better in 'The Constant Gardener (2005),' whilst the issue of children being taught to become killers was more effective in 'Cidade de Deus / City of God (2002).' Interestingly, both of these were directed by Fernando Meirelles.<br/><br/>Though perhaps a bit too ambitious for its own good, Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' is an entertaining two hours, and has its own fair share of positive attributes. At the very least, it brought the horrific Sierra Leone Civil War to my attention; I'd honestly never heard of it before. That alone is enough for me to consider this film a success."
"DonFishies","7","3","5","24 March 2007"," Could have been a lot better if it was more focused
","Leading up to its theatrical release, Blood Diamond had a lot of controversy over its depiction of the conflict diamond industry. It arrived, and was met with apprehension by critics, and did not exactly light the box office on fire. It went on to a few awards, and eventually, five Academy Award nominations. So was there actually a good movie here, or was it just overly average? <br/><br/>Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) lives a tranquil life with his wife and three children in a village outside of Sierra Leone. One day, a group calling themselves the RUF, the Revolutionary United Front, comes blazing into the village, devastating it, and capturing Vandy. He is put to work mining diamonds, and happens to come across an extremely rare diamond everyone wants their hands on  a blood diamond. He buries it, and ends up getting arrested with much of the RUF and other prisoners. It is in prison, while having an argument with one of the leaders, that diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes a shine to him.<br/><br/>This description only skims the top of the immensely subplot laden film. While the essential plot is for Vandy and Archer to go and get the diamond, there is also bits with a female journalist named Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) trying to cover the conflict diamond story, the search for Vandy's son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) who has been captured by the RUF, and the whole big scheme of the international diamond sellers who are both battling complaints about accepting conflict diamonds, while they are waiting for Archer to deliver on giving them this blood diamond.<br/><br/>It gets to be a little too much in some cases, racing around in circles and introducing characters at a moment's notice. A lot of them barely get any screen time, but they are introduced anyway and are thrown into the mix of the storyline. But even saying that, the film is downright boring in some cases. I had to turn it off because it just stopped going anywhere after awhile. It sets itself up pretty nice, but then falls into a lull that lasts for almost the entire second act. It takes long enough to get there, and even longer to reach the third. It just feels awkward, and begs of needing much stronger editing. At a sluggish 143-minute runtime, it could have done with it and could have ended up being so much more focused than it is. It is interesting, but could have been a lot shorter.<br/><br/>Another issue is how preachy the movie gets. We understand that there is deep trouble concerning the mining for these diamonds. We do not need characters to bash us over the heads with their prolific and exhausting dialogue. In some cases, it comes naturally off the character's tongues and feels like it needs to be there in the conversations. It feels right, and only adds to the film's goal of authenticity. But in the majority, the dialogue feels like it was tacked on just to get a rise out of the audience. A call to action, sort to speak. What is worse is these moments are glaringly obvious, and make the film out to be more amateurish than it actually is. This is a big budget Hollywood production, not a film student's sociology film. Adding unnatural dialogue just for the sake of it, only stinks of trouble.<br/><br/>The actual action and film-making techniques employed in the film are not all that bad though. The cinematography is excellent (if slightly feeling a bit too much like a take on the visually superior Children of Men), and the art direction is wonderful. The pieces of Africa that they capture are just so majestic, that even the most brutal of violence still looks great on camera. A huge gunfight sequence on the streets of Sierra Leone is well orchestrated, and is filmed gorgeously. Another helicopter raid sequence is almost right on the same par. The action is raw and gritty. It feels authentic, and also feels horrific in its brutality. The very blood reddish colours used throughout the film are a testament to this, both during scenes of massive violence and in scenes of tranquil beauty. Even the grounds walked on are red.<br/><br/>Acting wise, everyone is a bit mixed. Hounsou is clearly the best of the bunch here, but only really begins showing the needed genuine emotion near the end of the film. He has a bit during the middle, but throughout the rest, he just has nothing. He is vastly talented, and he plays his role with an absolute desire for perfection, but he is just not totally right in every case. DiCaprio fares much worse. His accent, while being truthful to South Africa (or so I am told), is one of the most annoying things I have ever had to listen to. It works sparingly, and when his voice is not breaking into his actual American accent, just does not feel right for this film. His acting is good as always, but not up to the same calibre as Hounsou, or even himself in The Departed. He really needs to work on his inner ""scumbag"" role. He is supposed to be selfish here, but he really just looks undecided in how he should act.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast is okay in their small roles (especially Kuypers). Connelly is good in her role as the journalist, and is very strong for a character I never expected to be anything more than slight eye candy. She has done much better work in the past though.<br/><br/>Better focus on the story, and more genuine emotion would have helped this film a lot. It is too long as it is, and gets really preachy in some cases. It is an interesting, albeit flawed, film to watch, but it does the job. It just could have been a whole lot better.<br/><br/>7/10."
"garvneil","3","8","20","5 February 2007"," Clichéd nonsense......
","Having read many other reviews of Blood Diamond on this site, I feel compelled to post my own. It seems everyone who viewed this film was blinded by Leonardo's highlights. Hollywood rarely deals with Africa well when depicting it on celluloid. Blood Diamond is a showcase for a strained and showy performance from Dicaprio. The illegal diamond trade became merely a backdrop for several Rambo like action sequences. Anyone viewing this film with little knowledge of African people would come away thinking they are mostly bloodthirsty diamond grabbing savages. The simplistic portrayal of Djimon Honsous' character does little in humanizing the African for the viewer. Yes, he is an honest fisherman and loves his family, yet he is still merely a prop with minimal depth. Honsou is an accomplished actor who comes through the best with the worst material.<br/><br/>In a scene where Jennifer Conollys' journalist character questions why she is bothering to illuminate the atrocities carried out in Guinea and Sierra Leone, she states that her story could just turn in to an infomercial like the ones depicting starving African children with bloated bellies. The irony was all too much. While highlighting such stereotyped representations of Africans by the media, the film itself did not escape such pitfalls. It was guilty of the very same tired African representations it claimed to be distant from.There were also numerous aspects of the plot that defied logic and common sense that i will not get in to here. The movie was also far too long capped by a preposterously melodramatic finale. It seems the exploitation of the Africans to sell products to the west continues, this new product is called Blood Diamond."

","Wow, I wasn't expecting this. I wanted to go see Apocalypto but it was sold out. Thank goodness it was. This movie was an eye opener in every way possible. Not only was it sending a strong political message about how these diamonds are harvested and sold but the pure nature of evil in countries where there is no leadership, no stability, no morale. I recommend it and hopefully some Oscars are coming there way. To me, DiCaprio, did an outstanding performance as well did Connelly, but Hounsou will definitely get the supporting actor award. These actors and actresses gave it their all in this. The cinematography will have you realizing that you are blessed in every way possible.

Jennifer Connelly wasn't even existing, however Djimon Hounsou's performance is the real reason to see this movie in the theater. He was outstanding, and his gripping, heart wrenching performance better get him an Oscar and many other nominations and most certainly Wins. The message delivered in this film is loud and clear.

","If anything the tone of this film is uneven, and at worst damn right inappropriate for the serious subject matter. I kept thinking I should be watching a socio/political drama rather than what is basically an action movie. The characterisations are monosyllabic and unaided by performances from the usual array of dross Hollywood actors. Russell Crowe, although a little old for the part, would have given it more weight and machismo - I can never quite take DeCaprio in this kind of role - especially when he keeps slipping in and out of that duff Rhodesian accent, and Jennifer Connely was plain irritating. A little more care with the script, and greater consideration and delicacy with casting and direction, would have made it a much more engaging film.

Pluuuuhesse! Enter Jennifer Connelly straight from the CNN News castoffs list as Maddy (Who thought of that yuppie, fake name?). She, parades around the beach bar at Freetown, with one breast a-dangling and bumps and groans aloud with the other fake name Danny Archer boy. They hit-it-off with designer beers, phony fags and much clichéd trash talk, actually fluff sounds. Oh yeah... 'Danny boy' comes replete with a wretched South African accent; which sounds less than wooden. He hardly qualifies as a respectable 'crunchie' let alone bushveld hardened ex-Rhodie fighter.<br/><br/>They are all pathetic, even Djimon Hounsou. Okay, he did pump a little iron between scenes. But even that didn't help him kick Danny boy's tight ass character. What a wimp (both of them).<br/><br/>This B-Rated film even stole heavily from the ancient Greeks. The real baddie (African rebel RUF RUFF captain ) is transformed into a silver eyed Cyclops, who then gets his comeuppance from a diamond encrusted shovel, though on the back of his plaster padded skull.<br/><br/>Let me explore the plot/theme.

","Blood Diamond by Edward Zwick is a good political war film featuring Leonardo Di Caprio. Set in Sierra Leone and against the backdrop of the treacherous business of blood diamonds. A struggle between corporate greed and the need to be a moral individual with a title on your head is what the films roller coaster plot consists of. All the actors are excellent, especially Leo who is in top form. The cinematography is quite good and Zwick's direction is as crisp as its easy going.

"ketgup83","9","2","3","1 December 2012"," a beautiful movie made right from the heart with beautiful message
","Blood Diamond was a great hard-hitting movie with heart-felt story and brave performance by Leanardo Dicaprio and Djimon Hounsou. The Story <br/><br/>West Africa is dominated by diamond smugglers who are capturing the poor and innocent people to use them as a slave for digging out the diamond stones underneath the ground. A fisherman is captured and forced to work there. During one such operation , he finds a big piece of diamond which he hides at secret place. Leonardo Dicaprio is hired by mafia to find the man and search for the diamond. The Review Directed by Edward Zwick ( The Last Samurai ) , Blood Diamond is a path breaking film never attempted by any on silver screen. Right from the beginning , the film is hard-hitting and gives a sympathetic feeling for innocent fisherman and their kids who are brain-washed by the diamond mafia and turned into a terrorist. Leonardo's character starts off with negative vibes but his transformation into good human being is the highlight of the film. Few scenes do stand out. The jail scene where Solomon vents out his anger at the mafia leader. The interaction between Leonardo and Djimon in the beginning and how they become friends and help each is the highlight of the film. Hats off to Edward Zwick for making a brave film like. It really takes courage to showcase how a small piece of diamond can bring in a huge difference when it sold in European countries. Screenplay holds your attention right from the beginning and is crispy. Cinematography is awesome capturing the rough terrain of Africa with aplomb. Background score goes well with the film. Leonardo Dicaprio is superb. His transformation from a bad-ass army guy into a good human being with big-heart is captured appropriately. Djimon Honsou completely surprises you with powerful performances. He get into a character of a man who must do anything to protect his family. Jennifer Connelly provide ample support to the star cast. The Bottomline Overall , a beautiful movie made right from the heart with beautiful message. Highly recommended 4.5/5"

"bkoganbing","10","2","3","1 July 2009"," T.I.A.---------- This Is Africa
","One of the best films of the new century so far, Blood Diamond is both great action entertainment and a searing indictment of the exploitation of the African continent even years after the imperial European powers left their colonial possessions to fend for themselves. Africa, a continent wealthy in mineral resources with its peoples reduced to poverty at the mercy of tribal rivalries now armed with the automatic weapons of the former imperialists.<br/><br/>By the title you guess that what people are after are diamonds which is a trade to be sure that has its international regulations. It also has people willing to skirt and ignore those regulations in pursuit of the almighty profit. The brokers be they in London, New York, or Amsterdam pay plenty of money under the table for the gems which then finance various 'revolutionary' groups who have this game going with the governments. They don't really want to take power as Leonardo DiCaprio explains to journalist Jennifer Connelly because then they'd have to govern the country. Better just to keep the revolution going, get bought off until the rulers get rich enough and just go into exile and the revolutionaries are stuck with it. No Nelson Mandelas among this crowd. And the poor as typified by fisherman Djimon Hounsou suffer.<br/><br/>Chance and happenstance throw Hounsou in jail with Leonardo DiCaprio, a mercenary. Hounsou found and buried a large diamond the size of a bird's egg. DiCaprio learns of it when they're in jail together and the two make an alliance of convenience when there is a rebel attack and they're freed from prison. The bulk of the story concerns the two of them trying to retrieve that diamond to get out of Africa and on to a more settled life in Europe and/or America.<br/><br/>DiCaprio and Hounsou were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively. In different categories to be sure so they would not kill each other off in the voting. Sad to say neither of them won and that is a pity because I think they both deserved it.<br/><br/>Hounsou is best known as the slave leader Cinque who overtook the crew of the Amistad in that film and he also got an Oscar nomination for that film. As for Leonardo DiCaprio, for me this is the best film he's been in so far in his career. His character is absolutely flawless.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is from Rhodesia and lest one thing that whites did not suffer in the changing sub Saharan Africa of the last half of the last century when he tells his story to Jennifer Connelly, you will graphically realize why DiCaprio is the hard case he is. After about five or six generations of settlers there, DiCaprio felt Africa was his home as well. You will empathize with that point of view after that scene.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond got Oscar nominations for Sound and for Film Editing. Sadly it did not win anything that year. And it is beyond belief it was not considered for Best Picture.<br/><br/>There's enough action to satisfy those fans, but the real essence of Blood Diamond is the story it tells both of an exploited Africa and of the alliance/friendship of DiCaprio and Hounsou. Don't miss this one at all."
"Vantec","7","2","3","23 December 2007"," Decent Action Fare
","The problem with Blood Diamond isn't so much what it is, but what it purports to be: an important social statement. A third in Danny Archer - the Rhodesian former mercenary and now diamond smuggler well portrayed by DiCaprio - causticly reads aloud from the trite account reporter Jennifer Connelly types of shared harrowing experiences. A sentence or two into the exploitive, over-dramatized narrative she closes her laptop and agrees 'it's crap, and it won't change a thing.' It's an ironic moment. <br/><br/>The genocide of Sierra Leone is one of the great tragedies of the 20th century. Here it's mostly a backdrop for the Adventures of DiCaprio and Connelly. Will Archer retrieve the pink diamond from rebel territory and pay his debts? Will Connelly make a difference? Will love blossom between DiCaprio and Connelly? Will they escape and live happily ever after? What has any of this to do with the slaughter of innocents? Companion Djimon Hounsou's frantic quest to re-unite his family and rescue his kidnapped child from service in the rebel militia takes second place and the death of Sierra Leone a distant third. Both serve mostly as means for putting DiCaprio into new tense situations. Think shootouts, car chases and exposing international diamond smuggling scandals.<br/><br/>Without its pretensions Blood Diamond stands as a pretty good action/romance. Connelly is unconvincing as the far too beautiful and earnest battle-hardened field reporter but Hounsou's fisherman/father drawn into DiCaprio's quest for riches is well acted, if let down by the screenwriter's incessant need to force his character into insanely stupid and self-destructive acts for the sake of creating yet more 'tense situations'. It's well shot with memorable action sequences. When the film shifts long enough from its center to focus on the world of RUF child-soldiers or explore the relationship between DiCaprio's old white Africa and Hounsou's by-standing innocence, things get interesting. In the right hands it would make for an excellent movie with an important message. <br/><br/>With its false pretensions though the film ironically ranks as just another in a long line of exploitations, this time making money directly from African tragedy rather than creating one for the sake of rubber, oil or diamonds. For best effect watch it as a socially conscious 'Die Hard'."
"conmech","10","2","3","8 November 2007"," Still Wanna Buy That Diamond Ring?
","Blood Diamond is the perfect movie which pokes in your eyes how many lives it takes to buy that piece of ""shiny stone"". Since the diamond market is definitely a huge one, at the end of the movie there is a text which tries to encourage us to buy ""clean diamond"". Why buy diamond at all? Even apes don't try to seduce their females with shiny rocks. Anyway, ""Blood Diamond"" is not just a movie limited with a good story, it is packed with good acting and good quality action scenes. In my opinion the most memorable scene was where little children get drugged and become killers, giving themselves English nicknames, like ""I am, master of disaster"", ""I am, see me no more"" I had watched ""Lord of War"" right before this movie. Those bloody diamonds are what two movies have in common and I think both of them must be seen. There's definitely a huge amount of work put in the movie, sometimes I was feeling I was the director and getting exhausted just watching the movie. And it definitely has the most important aspect of a masterpiece; when the movie is over, you just wanna restart the DVD and watch it all over again."
"ClaytonDavis","7","2","3","23 October 2007"," Blood spilled by the Script
","Director Edward Zwick brings us the authentic and socially significant Blood Diamond starring Academy Award nominees Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou and winner Jennifer Connelly. This is the story of Danny Archer, (DiCaprio) a South African smuggler who crosses the paths of Solomon Vandy, (Hounsou) a fisherman in search of his lost son and Maddy Bowen, (Connelly) an American journalist in search of a story. When Solomon hides a rare diamond, everyone including Archer will stop at nothing to gain possession.<br/><br/>Zwick who has brought some tantalizing and underrated pictures such as The Last Samurai and Glory has truly brought forth a magnificent piece of cinema here. Zwick can't save the film however from the lukewarm script by Charles Leavitt. The message of the film is quite powerful, quickly engaging the viewer and hooking us into it. The film's visual aspects is what pulls the viewer through with the journey a diamond makes from the ruins to the finger.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his strongest performances of his career and the year. Alongside his powerful work in The Departed, 2006 belonged to him. No other performance this year had us invested in a character we know we shouldn't be loving. Its quite remarkable how engaged we become with Danny, the evil, the antics, the redemption, all these qualities arouse the audience in character development. DiCaprio takes his first huge step into an adult role which he's struggled with for the past ten years. Becoming a male Meryl Streep, taking on an accent and an against type character is sensational for the young actor.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou, showing us high range emotion at every glance ends up coming up a little short. It wasn't really his fault, his character didn't have the investment that DiCaprio's did. As he searches for his son, the story disenchants the audience so by the time we're ready for a meaningful reunion, the audience is left behind in the premise. Hounsou did the best with his material but doesn't even come close to his previous powerhouse performances in Amistad and In America.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly's talent is entirely wasted in a character of no importance or significance to the story. Her love affair with Archer is so distracting and unwanted that by near end of the film, we yearn for extinction. This is Leavitt's biggest failure of the picture in the creation of a character. Connelly just can't gain any traction after her Oscar for A Beautiful Mind; she remains on the sideline and as the role seemed promising, it bombs from entry.<br/><br/>Technical aspects of the film are decent enough with strong film editing, cinematography and musical score. All barely above average, nothing spectacular, just a mediocre picture. I'm afraid I can't blame Zwick, he gets an A for effort as well as the cast. The film failed on story alone.<br/><br/>Grade: **½/****"
"Quinoa1984","7","2","3","19 December 2006"," a message picture, sure, but a good one, with strong leads
","Surely Edward Zwick is no stranger to tackling big hot-button topics (the most prominent for me is the Siege where terrorism and martial law in the US) and merging them with ""old-fashioned"" studio values. Old fashioned meaning that we can expect something of a happy ending, if not for everyone involved then for the more important characters in the lot. Here we're given much more bloody, graphic violence though, with plenty a curse to be found as well, plus some disturbing subject matter, like with children being taught to shoot at younger and younger ages in countries abroad. But it's a reality too that Zwick and his team are capturing with Blood Diamond, a dramatic thriller about the corrupt system that was (or maybe still is) in effect in Africa where diamonds get shipped across country lines, then get transferred to the rest of the world, but not without the share of multiple casualties, to confusing lengths (appropriately so). It carries it's message in tow throughout, particularly at the end hammering it in like a hangover. But aside from this, and a couple of rushed bits in the script and storytelling, it's a solid picture with some terrific performances.<br/><br/>Although I'd still go with Leonardo DiCaprio's turn in the Departed as his best role of the year (though it goes without saying that it might be my favorite from him so far as an actor anyway), his work in Blood Diamond is not to be scoffed at in the slightest. He's a man through and through here, which may be undermining his work in his 20s, but here at the least he seems poised completely to be a rugged action hero, or a tough one to be sure, who can kick ass and get the job done while also having a touching arc to his tormented, cynical character Danny Archer, diamond smuggler. When he finds out about a very big diamond hidden by Solomon, played by Djimon Hunsou, in assuredly- if I had to guess in shallow terms- an Oscar contending performance for his overall compelling nature. Solomon also lost his family during a raid by rebels who wiped out most of his village. He finally finds most of his family in a refugee camp thanks to Danny and Maddy (Jennifer Connolly, good if not stellar, though not with as much to do), a tough and one-sidedly moral journalist. But his son is not there, and has been indoctrinated into the ranks of the young rebels with guns, whom now he has to strike a deal with Danny- diamond for son, son for diamond, a fair trade it might seem, as Danny just wants to get out of the maelstrom of wretched violence and death that comes with his job.<br/><br/>All of this then is done in a slick, professional style by Zwick and his crew, and that isn't at all problematic (if at times feeling rushed with the script, though definitely Zwick is still a good leap ahead of other contemporaries in the Hollywood action-film department). The story does lurch forward oddly in a couple of spots, mainly in how Danny and Solomon agree to be partners finally- in the midst of an all out street battle. And there's one scene towards the end of Danny & Solomon's journey- following Solomon reunited with his boy (and the subsequent quasi-deprogramming of the son's killing skills, which is very effective as an emotional scene)- that didn't seem too believable to me. But it's the performances and the heightened atmosphere of suspense in the air of a f****-up environment and topic that make it a worthwhile movie. Even when a story point seemed on the verge of total contrivance, I was always wrapped up in what the filmmakers and the actors were trying to convey, so there was always that emotional connection. It doesn't rise surprisingly above to task like the Last Samurai, Zwick's last flick, but it was a very good time throughout, particularly with one unexpected scene involving an animal carcass.<br/><br/>One thing's for sure- you'll be a little more questioning when you look at your local jewelry store for that next big present. 7/10"

Jennifer Connoly and Djimon Hounsou also deserve appreciation for their stellar performance in this political war thriller. I have seen many war films. But this one stands unique. I recommend this movie to everyone who takes movies seriously."
"CinematicInceptions","10","1","1","15 October 2017"," More movies should be like this.
","Normally, I wait awhile to review movies unless I see them in theaters, but I feel compelled to review this movie sooner. It had an immediate and profound impact on me in a way that few movies have. The story here is not special in a cosmetic sense, and doesn't do anything fancy in any production areas. But it hits the viewer on so many levels with brute force. There's a ton of emotion that makes you really care for the characters and want to help the characters. It shows a real international issue from all sides and puts it in context of how it impacts one family. <br/><br/>Solomon's struggle to get back to his family was tangible at every step along the way in his triumphs and his failures. We see his dedication to raising a safe and successful family right away, which I think is great because it legitimizes the way he is always in contrast to the violence around him. It's wonderful that he gets so much attention because him trying to make a better life for his family is what seems to be the best way to combat the corruption and violence that is tearing the country apart. Danny is the contrast to Solomon, but he's also someone we can root for in a way. His goals are not as pure as Solomon's but they are pressing enough that I found it believable that he would use Solomon the way that he does. The ending with him helping Solomon and his son escape and calling Maddy as he bleeds out is a beautiful moment. Maddy was also an unexpectedly good character. I couldn't tell at fist if she was going to be a big character or just appear for the one bar scene. I really liked the scene where she and Danny talk about how difficult it is for the diamond issue to be solved.<br/><br/>The social issue of the diamond trade seeps its way into every scene, even the romantic tension between Danny and Maddy, and the surprise ambushes from the revolutionaries. Even when the focus is on the characters, it's always in the context of the diamond issue. This was what really struck me about the movie. As soon as it finished I immediately felt obligated to start researching the products that I buy and find out how it gets made. Maddy has a line at one point, ""People back home wouldn't buy a ring if they knew it cost someone else their hand."" Well, this movie made me want to find out how many hands I've chopped off without knowing it and make sure I don't cut off any more. I'm thinking that I'll boycott companies by telling them that I won't buy their products unless I can be assured that nobody's getting screwed over in the process. It might not do much, but if enough people boycott, it might. I'm only mentioning this to show just how powerful of an impact this movie had on me and why you should watch it before it goes off Netflix. Blood Diamond's message to us as consumers is: ""Let the buyer beware.""<br/><br/>If you liked Babel, you will love Blood Diamond. It's not really an action movie even though there's a lot of fighting in it, but it will definitely keep your attention and make you feel something. The scene where Solomon is reunited with his son Dia Vendy nearly made me cry and had me on edge the whole time. It's very character driven, but also shows all sides of the issue. I just cant say it enough: watch this movie. It's your obligation as a citizen of the world. Overall Rating: 8.7/10."
"smetin","10","1","1","20 April 2017"," A truly awe-inspiring movie with a powerful message
","I remember seeing this movie when it came out in cinema. To give you a glimpse into my life, i was suffering from an eating disorder at the time and was very very ill at the time. My dad took me to the cinema in an attempt to try and connect with me. The story of a father doing everything he could to get his son back from the arms of an African warlord was emotional enough on its own. When my dad said that he would do the same to get me back I truly broke down and it was a turning point in my life. From that point I got the care I needed and am now writing this review as a final year medical student in at Cambridge university. How things change, huh?<br/><br/>Well, back to the movie. The story line hinges on the discovery of a huge diamond that was hidden by a father who had his son taken by an African warlord. When the DiCaprio's character learns of this, he uses the father to get the diamond, whilst the father uses DiCaprio's influence on various means of transportation to get his son back. A sort of mutual agreement. The journey these characters go on from there, both physically and emotionally, was just incredible. The script was well-written and the acting was truly some of the best I had ever seen. In particular, DiCaprio's accent made me believe he had been South African born and bred. <br/><br/>Honestly, I cannot fault this movie. Maybe it is because it has such a special place in my heart, but I think it is more than that. I never cry watching a movie, but there is always one scene (near the end) that gets me every time. There is a reason why I make an effort to watch this movie at least once a year - it is a masterpiece."

","My first impression of the movie was that Leonardo DiCaprio was not deep enough and that he was just trying to force out a tough version of Indiana Jones.---WRONG! His role as a South African diamond smuggler, Danny Archer, evolves into a very full and complex character with a very important story to be told. <br/><br/>Other first impressions about the expected stereotypical roles of the Western journalist, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) and the native Sierra Leonean fisherman, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) turn out to be equally wrong as the movie unfolds and the nature of their roles becomes more apparent.<br/><br/>These three central characters—from totally different backgrounds--meet under unusual circumstances, but they all eventually need and explicitly USE each other to achieve their very different goals.<br/><br/>The story behind the 1990s civil war in Sierra Leon is told here in an enlightening and entertaining way. After seeing the movie, I was prompted to Google more details about the West African location of Sierra Leon and the actual history behind the civil war there.

"nmholland","9","1","1","28 March 2016"," A Very Underrated Film That Deserves More Attention
","Blood Diamond is directed by Edward Zwick and is the true story of Denny Archer, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, a smuggler who, in the middle of a civil war in Sierra Leone, meets a fisherman named Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) that is the only man who knows the location of a giant diamond, buried deep underground. With the help of a news reporter named Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), they must find the diamond, and Solomon's family, before the native rebels, or the British military, find it, or them.<br/><br/>This film is very underrated. I wouldn't say it's one of DiCaprio's best, just because of the rest of his filmography, but it really is a great movie. I only had a couple of complaints, and that's really saying a lot. Although Edward Zwick, the director, hasn't really done too much, he really does a great job with the camera work. Every shot captures the African landscape beautifully, and really pays respect to the film's cause.<br/><br/>The acting is also amazing. DiCaprio, as always, does fantastic, and Djimon Hounsou does really well too. I've seen him in other stuff, namely Gladiator (2000), but he really shines in this movie. I would even go as far as to say that this is his best work. Jennifer Connelly does really well, and also sticks out, in a good way. She plays a strong female role, without having to have a man beside her, despite the inevitable romance in the film.<br/><br/>The action in the movie is very well directed, and is paced well. There's no sequences of non stop action, but there's not any boring parts either. The action scenes and drama scenes are spaced evenly, and add to the film in a good way. The hand to hand fights were very well choreographed, as were the firefights. The last pro I have is the score. The score for this, done by James Newton Howard, really pounds into you the feel of the movie, and really won't let you forget the theme. This film was mostly made to let privileged people know what life is like in third world countries, and it does a great job at it, especially with the ending, where the score was at its peak, despite how good it was through the whole film.<br/><br/>The only real complaint I had with this film is the transition of scenes toward the middle. Now, this is a bit confusing, but I can explain it. Say in one scene, it would show the character of Danny talking with Maddy, then the next scene would show Danny and Solomon having a conversation. Now, this is a problem because the movie doesn't explain where the other character, be it Maddy or Solomon, is at the current time. Not all scenes were like this, and this is very nitpicky, but I would've just preferred a bit more clarification.<br/><br/>In short, Blood Diamond is a very underrated film, and worth anybody's time. I suggest you check it out, and even buy it on Blu- Ray; you won't regret it."

","Blood Diamond (2006): Dir: Edward Zwick / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly, Djimon Hounsou, Kagiso Kuypers, David Harewood: Powerful action adventure about the obsession for material gain. Set in Africa Djimon Hounsou is forced into slavery in search of diamonds while his family is taken away. His oldest son is being trained to become a killer. Leonardo DiCaprio takes interest in a particular diamond to which Hounsou hid but both have different intentions. Directed by Edward Zwick in an almost documentary fashion. This is perhaps his best film and contains themes similar to another film he made called The Last Samurai. DiCaprio continues on a winning streak of great roles as he goes from having shallow intentions to actually committing an ultimate sacrifice. Hounsou plays someone committed to his family enough to risk everything to save it. Jennifer Connelly plays a journalist who proves to be more than just a pretty face. Kagiso Kuypers is effective as Hounsou's son whose mind has been warped into a killing machine that his father will attempt to reach. David Harewood plays a character who goes by the name Captain Poison, which should be a real hit on an I.D card. The action is explosive without dismissing the plot. Theme regards sacrifice and how each character in the film seems to sacrifice for something. Score: 10 / 10"
"EricGaniwijaya","10","1","1","6 February 2016"," Diamond Rated Movie
","I've watched this great movie at Sunday morning and I've thought that this is a 'so-so' film. At first, I wanted to watch this film because of the leading actor, Leonardo DiCaprio. Recently I've watched some of his films because of his latest film The Revenant. After I've watched this film, I suppose to give it an excellent rating because of the story and what I get from this movie.<br/><br/>Yes, another excellent acting by Leonardo and a touching character by Djimon Honsou. Jennifer Connelly also made a good appearance. Such a cliché with the diamonds that has been selling or has been wearing by people around the world. This movie will give you insight about the cliché. This movie also taught about bravery, sacrifice, and the act of contribute to other people.<br/><br/>After all, this is a great movie!"
"stevegoralczyk","10","1","1","5 June 2015"," Puts things in perspective...
","First off, ignoring the Hollywood-ish tone to this movie, this is truly based on events that happened and are still happening every day. I'm a born American, but there is something about movies like this, hotel Rwanda, Tears of the Sun etc that really move me. Anything dealing with a genocide is hard to stomach.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, this is by far Leonardo DiCaprios best performance in his illustrious career. His character is very intriguing and his accent is on point, and magnetic. I really do not know how he did not win the Oscar that year, losing to an inferior actor in forest Whitaker. Maybe one day Leo...<br/><br/>Djimon Honsou is also electrifying in his supporting role, and his emotions moved me as they did in Amistad. <br/><br/>Brilliant movie here and great direction, must see!"
"karagoraymond","8","1","1","18 March 2015"," An Eye Opener !
","Gripping, touching, thrilling, awesome; just some of the words that come to mind when I think of Blood Diamond. It's just a terrific film and what I really liked was how much depth the characters where given, not just the protagonists but even the lesser characters such as the villain, RUF leader Captain Poison. This is something that director Edward Zwick has always been very good at and has demonstrated in earlier films such as Glory or The Last Samurai and I hope he begins directing such films again soon.<br/><br/>Other than that, the music was excellent (One of James Newton Howard's finest) and the pacing was effective in that you truly felt as if you were on a journey with these characters. The cinematography was outstanding, and despite being centered on a civil war, the film allows for some beautiful shots further emphasizing the natural beauty of the majestic African continent. Important issues were touched in the film such as the Wests exploitation of third world countries but it was done in a way that (at least in my opinion) was not too controversial in a time where films can be banned in countries, so I don't feel the film went too far. Also the film touched on the West's view of Africa, as brought up by Hounsou's character in the film, and I do share his view that Africa will one day be a ""paradise."" Though not a family film, Blood Diamond is a spectacular film and would recommend it to virtually anyone."
"orourkec-292-269155","8","1","1","12 December 2014"," I'm so impressed.
","Blood Diamond is one hell of a well done motion picture but the one thing I was particularly impressed with in all of the film was Leonardo DiCaprio's performance. I say particularly impressed because DiCaprio's performance was outstanding and it was worth the Oscar nomination. It was an amazing effort he put there and I'm proud of him for that. I say that I'm proud of him because he's my favorite actor. Another way I would also describe (and love to describe) DiCaprio's performance is dazzling. Djimoun Hounsou and Jennifer Connely play well too. Djimoun Hounsou delivers an incredible performance and acts and behaves exactly the way you would expect a Sierra Leonan and Mende guy to in real life regarding the situation in which he finds himself into during the story. Jennifer Connely is well cast as the American journalist, she is beautiful and had sensual charm, for which I fell under. The story and the way of telling it was also impressive. More good things from this film include its beautiful locations, striking comments, strong humor, moving emotions, excellent character development, fine acting and the interesting romance shared between DiCaprio and Connely's characters, plus there are enough of them to satisfy. Congratulations Mr. Zwick (the director of the movie in case you don't know who is this person that I'm mentioning) for managing to make a really, really good movie and also for the strong and detailed focus put on the historically famous and important illegal diamond trades and for not shying away from the terrible massacres which took place in Sierra Leone in 1999 and the historical accuracy of it all. My rating for Blood Diamond is an 8.0/10"
"AverxgeJoe","8","1","1","8 December 2014"," This is Africa
","I watched Traffic the night before I watched Blood Diamond and I can't help to notice the similarity. Both movies have a substance, that makes money for some and makes others suffer for it. In Blood Diamond's case it's, surprise surprise, diamonds. Blood Diamond is more of a popcorn flick movie than Traffic was, but Blood Diamond doesn't lack any of the emotion or depth. Actually I think Blood Diamond had much more emotion than Traffic. Blood Diamond is a great film with good, but at times too convenient, story for my taste. The movie's story is fiction but some of the events happening are/have been real. There is a great mix of fiction and true story blended in.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing in the leading role as a smuggler who beneath the rough exterior has a deeper side. Djimon Hounsou is good as well. Both of them were nominated for an Oscar I saw. Jennifer Connelly wasn't too shabby neither.<br/><br/>Real deal however is the beauty of Africa. The film was really filmed in Africa and the result is wonderful. The movie almost feels like a tourist tour to Africa's nature. Also, I have been very pleased with James Newton Howard's scores. Most recently in The Hunger Games series. And this score was once again nothing more than amazing."
"JaydoDre","7","1","1","26 November 2014"," Good, but can't decide if it wants to be serious or not
","Blood Diamond is about a quick little diamond smuggler partnering with a local black man, with the former looking to get rich and the latter looking to save his family.<br/><br/>Movie has good camera work. Action is not too shaky and you can tell what is going on. And of course the beauty of Africa is guaranteed...as well as its wonderful civilian ugliness. You can tell the movie uses some CGI special effects on occasion but it does so sparingly enough. it looks OK.<br/><br/>Sound is good too. You get the local folk music, local French speaking rappers and on occasion some orchestral music. It sets a good atmosphere and is not overbearing.<br/><br/>Di Caprio's acting is not pleasant, but that is probably the point since he is playing a sleazy white guy. Sometimes he is convincing. Sometimes not so much.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond is not a bad movie overall, but there is something off about its nature and I am going to try and pinpoint it for you.<br/><br/>There is this one shot, a brief scene, that encompasses much that is wrong with the movie. A female character is sorrowfully looking at a refugee camp as the movie is convincing you how bad the situation is, but at the same time her shirt is unbuttoned just far enough for you to see her side-boob. She is standing there in the foreground together with the main protagonist, a blond white guy. Their black companion who's been searching for his family, is in the background and out of focus.<br/><br/>The movie shows how bad the civil violence is, but at the same time the main protagonist is a white guy who, of course, happens to be an ex-soldier and who can gun down faceless black men like chewing bubblegum....and he is of course given a photogenic white love interest, because even though the story does not call for it, that is what all action and adventure movies from Hollywood gotta do, right? This movie has a hard time breathing life into its imagery and its message because it insists of retaining elements of a cliché western action movie. I am trying to avoid writing major spoilers here, but once you watch about ten minutes of this film, you can pretty much predict the rest of it by yourself. The creators did not go as far as was needed because they were probably afraid to lose Western audiences.<br/><br/>And so, the story does not flow well, making strange choices, making some choices that belong in a movie that is serious about its material and choices that belong in a lighthearted action flick.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>It is entertaining. If you want a well put together action movie with an exotic tint, this will do."
"showgirl626","7","1","1","7 October 2007"," Not as great as I thought it would be, but still pretty great...
","This film initially captivated me, and I immediately fell head over heels for Solomon and his family. Djimon Hounsou always gives a phenomenal, passionate performance, whether he's in Amistad, Beauty Shop, or as a guest on ER. Whether he's a lead or a footnote, he's simply marvelous in the roles he chooses. In Blood Diamond, the other family members were also compelling in their roles, however brief.<br/><br/>DiCaprio really is a gifted actor. His accent in this film was very convincing. However, he played his role SO well that I had trouble believing in - or having any empathy for - his character until his last moments in the film. I fault the writing for this, not Dicaprio, for making it so difficult to care for a pivotal character that the viewer is supposed to care for. He ran the gamut of facades, but he proved again and again that his motives were exclusively self-serving. I was never able to trust Danny Archer until he knew he was dying. At that point it was too late to care for him.<br/><br/>And Jennifer Connelly? Though I love a couple of the movies she's been in (Labyrinth, House of Sand and Fog), I've never seen her in anything where her character does any more than superficially interact with other characters in the films. She's not engaging at all, and even DiCaprio couldn't pick up the slack for her to save their scenes in Blood Diamond. What her character accomplished in the end was the only thing that endeared her, otherwise I felt nothing.<br/><br/>The action of the film was fantastic, the cinematography beautiful, the fundamental story haunting and heartbreaking. I've never been a big fan of diamonds because they're too expensive and they look gaudy, but since seeing this film, I like diamonds even less.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou made this film the incredible experience that it was. The character of Danny Archer and Jennifer Connelly's lack of acting skill prevented it from being more for me. It is definitely worth watching; I'd even say it's worth buying on DVD, but lower your expectations a little or you'll feel a bit let down.<br/><br/>Recommended. Thanks for reading my comment."
"MaxBorg89","7","1","1","17 July 2007"," A bit uneven in tone and focus, but interesting and carried by a gripping double act
","Blood Diamond, Edward Zwick's latest feature, is supposed to do three things at the same time: a) make the audience feel guilty about the controversy surrounding ""conflict diamonds"", its point being we don't just ignore the problem, but actually support it; b) expose, not afraid of showing cruel details, the problem of child-soldiers, another problem that keeps haunting Africa (and South America, as seen in City of God); c) tell a story, in pure Hollywood tradition, of redemption and reconciliation, connected with the previous two issues. Now, the title seems to suggest Zwick's first aim should be the one that resonates with most energy. Oddly, it doesn't, the anti-diamond lecture being overshadowed by the children's exploitation subplot and its role in the main narrative.<br/><br/>The film is set in Sierra Leone, one of the most profitable zones when it comes to finding and selling certain precious little stones. One of these is found by Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a local who has been taken away from his family and used as a slave by one of the area's most powerful crime-lords. Once the latter is arrested, everything should go back to normal. Unfortunately, he manages to break out and decides to get back at Solomon, who refused to give him the diamond, by kidnapping his son and slowly turning the young boy into a cold, emotionless killing machine. Overwhelmed by despair, Solomon is willing to do anything to get his son back. And that's where Danny Archer (Leonardo Di Caprio) enters the game: a cynical mercenary with no concern whatsoever for other human beings, he accepts to help the grief-stricken family man in exchange for the infamous diamond, while a journalist named Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) tries to convince him he can become a better man.<br/><br/>The screenplay stages the classic confrontation between two radically opposed lines of thought, showing how both can learn something from the other and hopefully get to the end of the movie with a new set of values. This situation also occurred in Zwick's previous film, The Last Samurai, another story of honor and redemption, and both pictures got their main strength from the performances: much like Ken Watanabe, Hounsou is the film's real soul, injecting pain and humanity into the kind of character that would be used as the villain in more traditional flicks; and like Tom Cruise, Di Caprio shows he is capable of some really serious acting, although he should have received the Academy Award nomination (and won the Oscar, hadn't it been for Forest Whitaker) for The Departed instead of this movie. Why? Mostly because of the accent: even if he nails the South-African vocal quirks from his very first scene, every time he speaks it seems like his spot-on delivery and the rest of his intense work belong to two different worlds, whereas in Martin Scorsese's masterful gangster tale the Boston accent and the body language merged into the Titanic star's most accomplished and compelling role so far. Nevertheless, he has enough charisma to carry the plot, as opposed to Connelly who struggles to give something more to an essentially clichéd character.<br/><br/>The relationship between Danny and Solomon enables Zwick to lend extra weight to the scenes involving the grueling mental torture African children are subjected to in order to ""serve their country"" as miniaturized assassins. It's all stuff that has been filmed before, but the director knows what buttons to push to make the material shocking and, given it involves at least one person the audience should care about, a little upsetting.<br/><br/>By focusing on these elements with more interest, Zwick ironically fails to successfully convey what was intended to be the movie's big message (conflict diamonds are bad, okay?). Even the epilogue, where he ties together the main narrative and the two ""important"" themes he was supposed to explore, causes a sort of mixed reaction: while it is easy to root for the characters and cheer or cry because of how things turn out for them, chances of people starting to boycott ""blood diamonds"" after seeing this film are quite limited."
"gazzo-2","7","1","1","10 May 2007"," Fairly good movie, about what is expected....
","Reminds me strongly of 'Constant Gardner' and prob. 'Tears of the Sun' if you can believe it. DeCaprio's a rather Russell Crowe-ish character, for the most part you buy him and his Afrikaaner accent, despite a couple slip-ups here and there. He's a smuggler/mercenary sort who is just out for himself and winds up dragging the Diane Sawyer-ish Connelly character along for the ride while aiming for the 'Blood Diamond'. The only way to find it, of course, is to have Hermansou there lead him BACK to the mines, back to where his son is being forced into a hellish child-soldier existence, while all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>Basically this is a road movie-they cover an enormous amount of territory-rain forest, plains, high plateaus, sea-ports; you get the S African army(?) involved, lead by our friend the Mummy(!) Arnold Vosloo-this time w/ a head of hair. No wonder I didn't really recognize the guy-though here he plays a baddie once again. He's under-used, if anything.<br/><br/>The parts of this that work the best-again-the depictions of that terrible multi sided civil war from 10 years ago in Sierra Leone, the refugee camps, the attack on Freetown, etc. That's really good, Hotel Rwanda time. What doesn't work-well the attack on Freetown becomes a lot like either Tears of the Sun or Rambo, these guys are swamped by a Black Hawk Down scenario and make it out unscathed. They always seem to find the one friend or crony or good samaritan when they need one in the middle of nowheres. And face it-in this, Leo is meant to be a Rambo-lite.<br/><br/>I kinda wondered about his extended death-scene-being drug up the hill w/ a lung-wound, only then to turn round and hold off the pursuing baddies w/ a couple machine guns while Hermansou and son take-off. Sure. It's Hollywood-what ya expect? The movie itself is moving, well made, though the characters are flat and 2 dimensional save for Hermansou thru most of it. Connelly is fine but under-used. They do get the job done, the characters are all flawed beings, the intent was to clearly to educate AND entertain, for the most part I think Edward Zwick and co deliver.<br/><br/>*** outta ****"
"Eightythreeyearoldguy","7","1","1","20 March 2007"," A flawed, yet brilliant, diamond
","This is a movie I believe you should see. Just don't expect perfection because it isn't there.<br/><br/>First, let's discuss DiCaprio and whether the Academy was right in nominating him for this performance rather than for THE DEPARTED. I have to go with this one, and that isn't at all diminishing his other great performance. There simply were more scenes which he commanded here, and IMHO some scenes definitely eclipsed those in the other film. His character here seemed to me to be even more conflicted than his Billy Costigan character, and especially towards the end, you had to depend on minute nuances to tell what his character was actually doing.<br/><br/>Then, there's Djimon Hounsou who again deserved his nomination. He exuded braveness, family concern, varying emotions in regards to DiCaprio's character.<br/><br/>However, the above and the power of the message of the film just about sums up my feeling you should see it.<br/><br/>Pacing between violent and non-violent scenes failed and some scenes, powerful as they were, drug out for too long. The scenes after the mountainside scene were too long and possibly even unnecessary although they gave the viewer some satisfaction and a conclusion to all elements with which we were concerned.<br/><br/>This is still a movie to see."
"david-dtn","7","1","1","16 March 2007"," A strange mix
","What an odd film. I usually go into watch a film with a bit of background knowledge concerning plot or the general theme. I never saw the trailer for this one so i had no idea what to expect. To basic plot is about a civil war in Sera Leon and the murder and exploitation of its own people for the acquisition of its diamonds. Instead of helping the people in the region to free themselves from the tyranny of the rebels who are hell bent on using there own people as slaves to collect and harvest diamonds, the governments of the west exploit them further by aiding the rebels with money and fire arms. There are a few sub plots concerning the political back drop. The problem is its not really that interesting or entertaining. Thankfully there a few of these scenes and the story focuses more on the three lead charterer's and their own individual stories. Decaprio plays a diamond smuggler at odds with himself and his country, and is good in this but I'm not sure about his South African accent. It seemed forced in certain parts but this is only a minor grip. Jennifer Connellys plays a reporter in the midst of the turmoil. Her character seemed a little clichéd at the start with her presence only serving as a love interest but as the film progress's we soon learn more about her motivations and her own personal struggle. Djimon Hounsou really stood out in this in his role. I remember him in Gladiator, however he was a bit wooden there but wasn't given much material to work with. He has more to do in this film and steals every scene with a very genuine performance. My only problem with this film was what it was trying to be. It was a mix of different genres and as a result it felt a bit disjointed. I wasn't sure if i was watching an action adventure, action drama, war/romance or some combination of the above. For the most part this strange mix actually worked and combined to make a very watchable film. I don't think i would watch it again but the performances from its lead characters (especially Djimon Hounsou) make it 2 hours well spent."

","You're warn as soon as the movie began : you will learn lots of things about Africa (and especially the way USA fells about it), while watching a entertaining adventure movie. It opens with a warning about the situation that occurred in Sierra Leone (and particularly about the ""War Children"", that the movie denounces) and even locates it in a map to be sure everyone understands what's the movie talk about. But as soon as the anti-hero played by Leonardo DiCaprio arrives, the movie transforms itself in a (serious but still) fun and entertaining Hollywoodian adventure movie. You'll find reflection in it, but also explosions, denunciation of the ""war children"" but also gigantic gun fights, self criticism but mostly you'll see Oscar's winners stars running in the forest through explosions and gun fights, looking for the big rose blood diamond of the tittle. And of course, it also has an impossible romance between the idealistic Loïs Lane's style journalist and the ex-colonialist bad guy DiCaprio.<br/><br/>This well dosed mixture of a serious subject crossed with an adventure movie treatment reminds me of Joffé's ""The Mission"" or of the all serious filmography of the master of this kind of movie : Steven Spielberg (from ""Schindler's List"" to ""Amistad"" or ""Munich""). And although Spielberg is a far more talented, original and interesting director than Edward Zwick, this movie is a sure intelligent and entertaining movie."

It's a hard film to watch and is upsetting when you know it's based on fact. Others were very good in their roles as well. At one point I felt it was going to go on for too long, but that wasn't the case. There is some beautiful scenery in the film and other parts of the film where your jaw drops at the sheer horror of what civil war does to a country and what greed does to us all. If you're at all squeamish it's probably best to avoid it altogether but we all must sit through the truth sometimes like it or not."
"moonspinner55","3","7","18","13 May 2007"," ""Do you think I'm exploiting his grief?""
","When did action-adventure movies become so relentlessly mercenary, with scenes of bloody torture and mass mayhem (vis-à-vis political turmoil) replacing all the thrills? Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"" is morose and despairing--bloodshed in the sunshine--and is filled with ludicrous platitudes and world-weary observations from characters who fail to learn from their own mistakes. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a diamond smuggler from Rhodesia (talking with a clammy, unconvincing accent) who attempts to partner up with a poor fisherman from Sierra Leone, Africa (Djimon Hounsou) whom he believes knows the whereabouts of a rare pink diamond. A sub-plot about the fisherman's young son being trained for the guerrilla army is pretty brutal, yet it's just used as padding for this story, as is Jennifer Connelly's fatuous role as an American journalist who spits out bitter cynicism about her wealthy, indifferent country (after joining the two men, Connelly asks DiCaprio if she's exploiting the fisherman's grief, a question which the filmmakers would be well advised to ask themselves). Extremely well-produced and filmed, the picture has just one standout performance (by Hounsou, whose urgency grounds the movie in a solemn reality) and much screaming, gunfire, and anguish. Zwick may have purposefully ditched the high-end adventure of old-school films in the smugglers genre, but his political high-mindedness is a drag and the dialogue and most of the characters are insufferable. *1/2 from ****"
"sshan5","5","6","15","22 March 2007"," Painting by numbers
","How many clichés can you cram into one film? How many plot contrivances? I felt sorry for the actors having to pretend that someone had written them real lines, although the wooden performances, especially from Jennifer Connolly, made it seem that they didn't really care anyway. As for any sign of electricity between Jennifer and Leo - it wouldn't fire up an LED! The only reason I gave it 5 points was because of the nice sets and because some of coincidences that kept the plot on track and the characters in touch with each other were so silly that I actually laughed. As for Leo's wandering accent .......... the less said the better. Complete and utter rubbish."
"theskylabadventure","4","6","15","8 February 2007"," Zwick strikes out again
","I had my doubts about this film for one reason and one reason only; Edward Zwick. Zwick is one of those directors who can take a potentially brilliant film and reduce it to typical, patronising, Hollywood mediocrity; the kind of film you don't really need to see in order to know what happens and how (more recent examples include 'Legends of the Fall' and 'The Last Samurai'). Sure enough, that's precisely what he's done here.<br/><br/>'Blood Diamond' is pitched as a gritty drama about the diamond trade, when in fact it's little more than a generic American action movie which happens to be set in Africa.<br/><br/>Every African character in the movie is either a savage, a scumbag or a simpleton, DiCaprio and Hounsou being the ultimate of the latter two stereotypes respectively. The only character blessed with both decency and intelligence is - surprise, surprise - the American. Is this what America really thinks of Africa? If so, how dare they make a film that purports to care about the suffering of the African people?<br/><br/>The diamond trade is little more than a backdrop to yet another action-packed ""story of one man's redemption"". Our anti-hero (Leo) is self-serving scum who learns to be a decent guy from a nice American girl. Besides the fact that this idea is obscenely patronising, Jennifer Connelly looks far too beautiful and well-kept to convince us that this girl-with-a-heart-of-gold has been slumming it around Africa for three months. Leo's character development is completely inconsistent and fuelled by awful dialogue and overacting by all concerned. These are all pretty obvious flaws, for which I blame Zwick, not the actors.<br/><br/>Hounsou's character is a token ""poor, simple African farmer"" who so desperately needs the help of the white man and the nice American girl to find his family. While these supposed ironies are addressed in the film, its message ultimately seems to be a) that Africa is made up simply of sociopathic mercenaries and their victims, nothing in between; and b) that only the nice Americans can save them all from self-destruction.<br/><br/>There is a sub-plot wherein Hounsou's son is turned into a child soldier by the rebels. Firstly, this seemed like it belonged in a different film, and the subject is more than worthy of some strong media attention which is to say, a film of its own. To make matters worse, the boy's transition is hammered home in truly amateur style through a series of over-the-top montages. It would have been much more powerful for the audience not to see the transition, but to see the boy he became and then come to understand how it happened. Ultimately, that part of the story simply felt forced.<br/><br/>Alas, that part of the story was really the only part which showed just how awful the effects of the diamond trade are, as the rest of the film was dedicated to Leo's road-to-redemption-movie-by-numbers. Leo does very well with the two-dimensional character he is given, despite Zwick's tendency to push actors too far into the theatrical, and his accent is consistently convincing. That said, his performance in 'Blood Diamond' doesn't come close that in 'The Departed', yet the Academy chose not to acknowledge the latter.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly seems to have little function other than to look beautiful (which she surely does), and struggles to bring the character to life. Hounsou, however, is typically brilliant and virtually unrecognisable in his role, as his every gesture and mannerism is that of the character. One does get the feeling that Zwick pushed him hardest of all, as his underplaying is periodically interrupted by its antithesis.<br/><br/>Some fine acting aside, what we are left with is ultimately just a hollow action movie, a sort of sub-par Indiana Jones, if you will. The action sequences are very well done, but one cannot help but feel a little guilty in ""enjoying"" them, given the context of the film.<br/><br/>The action and drama wouldn't be complete without James Newton Howard, whose score reflects the pretentiousness of the film beautifully. Why is it that film-makers want to make a movie about Africa, and have an African score, but they don't want to use an African composer? Needless to say, the music is a completely pseudo (think 'The Lion King'), western interpretation of African music, which only serves to discredit the film further.<br/><br/>As for the political intentions of the film, there are early reports that it has had a negative impact on the diamond trade. Some papers even reported that certain diamond outlets offered to give $10,000 to charity for each celebrity that wore a diamond to the film's premier. Realistically though, how long is it likely to be before the next slew of movie divas and rappers make diamonds fashionable again?<br/><br/>Sadly, this film is so wide of the mark that it stands no chance of having a lasting impact, despite its noble intentions. The real problem is that however ""real"" or ""shocking"" it strives to be in order to put its message across, it is still just another American movie, and the audience - knowingly or not - always have that comfort in the back of their minds. The reason film-makers like Fernando Meirelles and Alejandro González Iñárritu pull off films like this, is that they take away that comfort.<br/><br/>'Blood Diamond' is, at best, a small, guilty pleasure. Of course, it's sufficeiently manipulative to dupe most people into taking it seriously, hence the high rating. It'll be interesting to see how many useful votes I get for this comment... I'm sure they'll prove my point."

","Going a little further than just displaying Africa's doomed fate, bringing more than routine characters, telling us a story about people before it is about politics and economics... in all three directions Blood Diamond is weak.<br/><br/>Edward Zwick's work brings no emotion, no suspense, to a story that is already too episodic and blended with on-the-nose dialogue. The actors try to make us believe in their stories, but they're one-dimension characters with some stock back-stories to make up for true flesh and bones. Djimon Honsou's part is the one that works best: it is simple alright, yet it never comes near to filling the flatness and predictability of ""Big Boy"" DiCaprio's nice and tidy mercenary.<br/><br/>Fortunately the location scouting was great, and Jennifer Connelly is gorgeous although only a part of the glorious scenery.

","Greetings again from the darkness. Edward Zwick has spent the past 8 years concentrating mostly on producing with the exception of the ultra-Hollywood ""The Last Samurai"". Zwick has a strong resume that includes ""Legends of the Fall"", ""Glory"" and ""About Last Night"". With ""Blood Diamond"" we get a very intense and interesting story that falls short of being great due to the Hollywood slickness applied.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio follows up his Oscar-worthy performance in ""The Departed"" with a wonderful portrayal of a diamond smuggler in South Africa. For his character, Archer, the film is his last shot at salvation and it results in self-discovery and soul redemption thanks to his ""partnership"" with Djimon Hounsou (so great in ""In America"" and ""Gladiator"") and his connection to an American journalist played by the beautiful Jennifer Connelly. Connelly is the main misstep in the film because we just can't buy her as the ""in the thick of the action"" type. Her character supposedly jumps from one world crisis to the next, but she comes across much more as the day spa treatment girl. Hounsou, on the other hand, is so real it frightened me at times. No one plays the angry man on a mission better than he.<br/><br/>Much talk will be made of DiCaprio's accent, but it is pretty solid most of the time and only fades out in a few scenes. His accent should not make or break the film for anyone, as it is a terrific story with amazing scenery and a great deal of intensity throughout the two and a half hour running time. I may have never seen a movie with more people gunned down ... especially innocent villagers. It is a moving story based on the reality of the diamond importing business."

","In 1999, in Sierra Leone, the fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) dreams on the day that his young son Dia Vandy (Kagiso Kuypers) will become a doctor. His dreams are shattered when the rebels invade his village and kidnap him to work in the diamond mines. Solomon finds a huge pink diamond and while hiding it, the commandant of the rebels sees, but the rebels are attacked and Salomon is arrested by the government army. While in jail, the wounded commandant tell the prisoners that Salomon found the stone, and the mercenary smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) from Zimbabwe releases Salomon and proposes to exchange the diamond by his missing family. Using the idealistic American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), Danny locates the wife and daughters of Salomon in a refugee camp, but is informed that his son has been recruited by the rebels. Salomon and Danny consolidate a partnership, with Salomon looking for and finding his son, and Danny looking for the diamond and finding redemption.<br/><br/>""Blood Diamond"" is a fantastic movie, with a dramatic story full of action, excellent direction of Edward Zwick and stunning performances of Djimon Hounsou, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kagiso Kuypers and Jennifer Connelly. It exposes the sad reality about the economical interests of the powerful nations in the poor Africa and how the news do not disclose this shameful situation to the world, ""dedicating one minute in CNN between meteorology and sports"" as ironically said by the character of Jennifer Connelly. It is also amazing how a movie like ""The Departed"" wins the Oscar of Best Film, when ""Blood Diamond"" is better and better.

The writing seemed unable to hold its ground both artistically and intellectually, relying on gimmicks to awe the audience. This only made the plot seem desperate and laughable--partially exhilarating for only 1.5 hours of this nearly 2.5 hour film.<br/><br/>The film was much like a cheap clock from The Sharper Image. It might contain an alarm, CD player, radio and weather station for the price of one, but all the parts are cheap--getting them all in one makes for a poorly constructed clock. This movie tried to mix James Bond with Hotel Rwanda and the emotional tension and drama of Real World. It attempted a serious plot with little affection.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing Babel and then Casino Royale--not both at the same time."

","Living in New York City, I used the opportunity to see a pre-screening of Eduard Zwick's latest movie and with BLOOD DIAMOND we have this year's major Oscar contender. Not only will this film get nominated in all main categories but it will most likely take home the big ones like BEST MOVIE, BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY, BEST SCRIPT, BEST EDIITING, etc.<br/><br/>If not BEST DIRECTOR, as well as the BEST ACTOR trophies for either DiCAPRO or HOUNSOU - are they going to be pitched against each other?! JENIFFER CONELLY is excellent too, but she will face the toughest competition since female supporting roles are the ones women usually get in Hollywood, but let's not get side tracked.<br/><br/>Enough Oscar talk, the season is not yet here and there's still room for another movie to convince that much as Eduard Zwick's masterpiece does. I doubt however that any other still to be released movie can keep up with the high quality of BLOOD DIAMOND. The topic is as relevant and important as the topic of a movie can be. It's almost filmed as a documentary. Mr. Zwick never lets you from the hook. There's lots of shooting and dying and only occasional breaks that let you breath again.

My preconception was both right and wrong. I was right about Leo, he was phenomenal. I would not be surprised if he were nominated for Best Actor this winter. His South African smuggler character is believable, as well as charismatic and driven. I was truly wrong about the movie itself however. ""Blood Diamond"" is a great movie. It is powerful in it's portrayal of civil war torn Sierra Leone, yet an incredibly fun and entertaining movie from beginning to end.

","I didn't know this was the same director who did ""Thirtysomething"" until after I saw this film. Now it's obvious he's still doing the same material only with bigger budgets and pricier actors. I like DiCaprio very much, I think he has a lot of talent and is developing into quite a fine actor. I wished he hadn't done this one though. I don't know if the writing was just so badly clichéd, lifeless and tedious or if this was a character not within his range. Certainly the former is true: the writing sounds like a smugly self righteous thirty-something American who feels somewhat guilty for his good fortune in this mostly unfortunate world and tries to alleviate his guilt by preaching about some of the evils in Africa and how he has brilliantly realized the solution to these evils comes down to a simplistic little step we can all do here and now. Of course being a sheltered, usually very self absorbed thirty-something kid his insights and solutions are naively simplistic and unrealistic. The situation this film is based on is very complex and the problems are so entrenched due to so many differing factors that a cute, neat happily-ever-after Hollywood solution won't work no matter how much wishing and believing we want to do. As well, every time DiCaprio did the white African accent I had to wince a little because it sounded just slightly off key enough to not seem natural. <br/><br/>I suppose I should mention Jennifer Connelly but after a few seconds with her character I kept turning away from the film and thinking of other things. She was so badly unrealistic as the savvy, seasoned reporter with her sophomoric self righteous indignation that she seemed to have been an irate and grotesquely self indulgent customer who was plucked from Macy's as she was raging at some poor clerk because the right shade of drapes aren't available that she ""absolutely needs"" because they go with her new carpet and is now doing this tirade in the middle of Africa in the place of some reporter. Her character seems better fitted for a ""Twilight Zone"" twist than anything resembling a reporter who has ever slept in a place worse than a Holiday Inn. (Ugh! Heavens no!) <br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou gives the only credible performance of the three main characters but even he can't save this smugly false vehicle from crash burning into a pile of toxic clichés. Perhaps my sights were too high, I had really enjoyed ""The Constant Gardner"" and felt everything worked very well in that slice of the exploited life in one of the way too many unfortunate places in Africa. But this was no Gardner, not even a part time one. This wasn't even a decent ""save the children"" ad: at least the solution they offer may have some real merit, while this one was dreamed up by a detached arm chair observer who has come up with their solution by scanning page six of the Times and catching the tail end of a documentary or two. Like the solution for world peace given by a young beauty contest candidate, it has a lot of nice sounding words and phrases but it's nevertheless just a few cute platitudes that have no real practical value. <br/><br/>Edward Zwick is way over his head here. I'd appreciate it if he'd stick to another ""thirty-something"" venture. Those projects I can clearly see from far away are things I can avoid so as not to have my intelligence insulted by a smugly self righteous and self absorbed preacher who thinks he has all the brilliant solutions to all the problems and lives he hasn't the vaguest real knowledge of beyond what he's caught in a National Geographic article and thinks by looking carefully at the accompanying pretty pictures he can figure it all out."

","If you get some spare time then I cannot recommend this film enough. It ranks up there with my all time favourites and is definitely up there with the best of them. See it on the big screen. It will lose too much on the small one (even though I shall be buying the DVD lol) Superb acting - Leo DiCaprisun & Djimon Hounsou are outstanding. Excellent script, superb direction and the cinematography is fantastic. It's fast, it's emotional, it's REAL, it's believable and the characters really pull you in. There are some difficult scenes to watch with rebel brutality (especially where the children are concerned) but they are just part of what makes it so real and so shocking.<br/><br/>There is a scene about three quarters of the way though the film where Leo's character is telling Jennifery Connelly's character about the brutal murder of his parents and how he grew up and what he now thinks of South Africa and it's people which I thought was outstanding. It was easy to forget for that ten or so minutes that he was actually acting - that's how good he was. Of course they went and ruined the end of that scene by sneaking in a little bit of romance. Aaaaagggghhh! <br/><br/>The battle/action scenes were shot all in one take which makes them pretty special. Especially where the rebels come to town and all hell breaks loose. You've got a good ten to fifteen minutes of mayhem, bullets, bombs, guns, bodies, fights, etc and each time it's all being done in just one take. Wow! If I had one criticism it would be Jennifer Connelly's character. Or was it her acting? I'm not sure. Either way she was the weakest link who I kept wishing would go away.<br/><br/>I've been a big fan of Leo's acting for a long time now and he's played some superb parts. He is one of those actors who doesn't seem to need to act - to act. He's up for an Oscar for this and I'd really like to see him get it (he should have won one for The Aviator!) but he has tough competition from Forest Whitaker's portrayal of Idi Amin in The Last King of Scotland (also an Oscar worthy performance) Memorable Quotes: Danny Archer (Leo): Sometimes I wonder if God will ever forgive us for what we've done to each other...

Story spans from Sierra Leone, Africa, cross continents to London, United Kingdom.

Yet no scenes are gratuitous: scenes of war, civil or any scale, are never mind-settling; the 'child soldiers' segments felt 'documentary-real' - mind-boggling (can they really do such 'heinous' things?), and on diamond mining - provocative (is that how diamonds are extracted from the earth? Is human kindness ever universal?) Script by Charles Leavitt ('K-PAX' 2001, 'The Mighty' 1998), cinematography by Eduardo Serra ('Girl With A Pearl Earring' 2003, 'What Dreams May Come' 1998), music by James Newton Howard (w-d M.

","In recent cinema history, I can rarely remember movies that hit so well on all fronts. This movie had it all. The action is heart-pounding and nonstop, and additionally, it does not distract from the storyline. The viewer sympathizes most with Hounsou's character, as his motivation is strictly as a family man. Yet, the interesting part arises from the sympathy the audience will want to give to DiCaprio's character, who is utterly horrible. The romance story is slightly underdeveloped, but this most likely corresponds to the lack of emotions the characters can give to each other since the setting and situation of war is emotional enough. Overall, the movie shines: the performances are spot on, the script is well written, and the cinematography is splendid. I highly recommend this movie."

It's not a good movie on so many levels. Come to find out, the critics didn't rate this movie very well either. I have little doubt that the user ratings were artificially inflated, because this movie is not an 8. Realistically it's more like a 6. <br/><br/>I'll start off with the positives. The movie had good acting and pretty landscape/imagery! Major props to Decaprio for maintaining a great acting performance despite the weak storyline/dialogue etc. That's where the optimism stops. The story-line is dreadful!... The far fetched story and action sequences put a Rambo movie to shame! Trust me, I am not exaggerating! Especially for a movie that's supposed to take itself seriously. DiCaprio's story with Connelly had little development and I felt no connection what so ever. spoiler - Is it really supposed to be a sad moment when he calls her up on the phone in the end? Talk about a dud of a movie. <br/><br/>Spoiler DiCaprio's character starts off like-able and becomes increasingly dislike-able as the movie plays out. It's one of those rare occasions when I would have been all down for the cliché' of essentially becoming enlightened along the way and giving the diamond away like he did, although the only reason he handed it off was because he was dying. I think if you throw Dicaprio and Connelly in a movie you could fool a lot of people into liking a movie. If these ratings are legitimate (which I doubt) people were fooled into liking it, because it's factually a weak movie! BTW I can't believe Dicaprio got nominated for best actor in this movie and not The Departed (one of the greatest acting performances in cinematic history)."

"abisio","7","3","7","4 December 2006"," A movie deserving a wide audience
","BLOOD DIAMOND is before everything else a movie full of good intentions. It is probably the type of history that will bother and teach in someway to everybody.<br/><br/>Solomon (Djimon Hounsou) is a pacific and innocent African native that trying to protect his family is captured by rebels and forced to work in a diamond mine. After witness several atrocities in the name of freedom and diamonds, Solomon finds a huge one and decides to keep it for himself (probably as a way to protect or recover his family); he is discovered in the intent and almost killed but saved the last minute by an enemy (or government army) attack. Danny (Leo di Caprio) on the other side is a white African mercenary doing weapon trade (for diamonds of course). Circumstances somewhat difficult to believe put these two on the road Solomon trying to get back his family and Danny the huge diamond.<br/><br/>This light and sometimes forced storyline is used to cross over several African countries and see atrocities of every kind between Black African's native; and a few by White people. The images are so strong, that if do not feel at least some guilt seeing a diamond; it is just because you are blind or has strange life values or beliefs.<br/><br/>It is true that white men created the huge mess in Africa; but it is also true that local corruption was (and is) the hand pressing the trigger. There are too many to blame for Africa's recent and not so recent history and the movie excels showing the cruelty behind it and even the absurdity of all that.<br/><br/>However, the movie with all its good intentions is far from perfect. Perhaps shortening certain scenes and avoiding the ALL American moral ending could make the movie far better and do not diminish the impact of what you just saw; but as many movies intended to create some shock BUT NOT TOO MUCH, it almost implies that even when Americans consume 75% of world diamonds, they will never do it if they knew where they came from.<br/><br/>Let's see how truth is in this statement."

","Just in time for the holiday season, director Edward Zwick offers the latest in his long line of bloated, liberal do-gooder movies, this one designed to make a bunch of privileged Americans feel ever-so-slightly-guilty about all of their Christmas consumerism. Of course, he (and Hollywood) doesn't want you to feel TOO bad about it (they want to make money off of us after all), so he gussies up his movie with a bunch of traditional action-movie histrionics that maybe wouldn't seem ridiculous if this was a jungle flick from the 1940s, but that in the here and now of 2006 feels like a hopeless attempt to give us our medicine with one hand while spoon feeding us ice cream with the other.<br/><br/>This is sanctimonious, hypocritical film-making as only Hollywood can deliver, folks. Let's show people what it's like in Africa, but let's not make it too realistic for them or they might not enjoy that popcorn they're scarfing down. We could tell the real story the way it really is, though no one would come to see it, or we can show Djimon Hounsou and Leonardo DiCaprio flexing their pecs and capitalize on people's love of a good ol' blockbuster.<br/><br/>DiCaprio plays a jaded diamond smuggler with a heart of gold. Jennifer Connelley plays a fiery reporter with whom he falls in love (yeah, right). Djimon Hounsou plays the noble savage (big surprise), who once again proves that he is cast in films primarily for his ability to scream at the top of his voice while delivering his lines. If you can muster up one ounce of concern about what happens to any of these people, good for you. I certainly couldn't, and while the lady next to me in the theater was sniffling and dabbing her eyes at any one of the film's shameless bits of sentimental nonsense, I was checking my watch and stifling a yawn.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that Edward Zwick has the best of intentions when making his movies, but I should have listened to my gut and stayed away from this film. He treats his audience as if they're stupid and can't understand a point unless it's underlined three times and has 20 exclamation points tacked on to the end. Yes, I'm glad that there are filmmakers who want to tell important stories to mass audiences and try to find methods of storytelling to which those audiences will respond. But if you're the kind of moviegoer who would rather engage in an intelligent discussion than listen to a bully -- no matter how well intentioned he may be -- pound away from his pulpit, Zwick's films are nearly intolerable, as this one is.<br/><br/>Grade: C-"

","So halfway through ""Blood Diamond"" some guy gets shot -- it really doesn't matter who -- and somebody starts tending to the wound, and somebody else inquires after the fellow and this exchange occurs:<br/><br/>""How's his pulse?""<br/><br/>""I can feel it sometimes."" <br/><br/>Right there is just about the most positive thing that can be said about this nitwit, sanctimonious, overblown picture. A thriller about the nexus between the diamond trade and Africa's never-ending wars, it's part action film, part buddy movie, part love story, part political tract and, in sum, much less: a meandering, preachy, condescending mess that only occasionally bursts into life and even then at such a tepid level that you can hardly call it living. As a social-conscience film, ""Blood Diamond"" demonstrates the worst sort of hypocrisy, straining to incorporate trite lectures about so-called ""conflict diamonds"" -- raw stones used by governments, warlords and rebels to purchase armaments -- while treating ordinary Africans in one moment like noble savages and in the next like cartoonish clowns out of a Three Stooges movie. Time and again, the film's white characters -- a soldier of fortune turned diamond smuggler (Leonardo DiCaprio), the world's stupidest journalist (Jennifer Connelly), a holier-than-thou ambassador (Stephen Collins) -- make grand speeches about how the selfish indifference of westerners leads to the suffering of innocent Africans. And then comes a scene like the one in which a threatening group of tribesmen are disarmed by a pretty white girl with a camera who wants to take their picture -- a moment of racist caricature that would make the ghost of Stepin Fetchit squirm. The context of this harebrained seesawing between the moralizing and demoralizing is a thriller about the civil war in Sierra Leone in the 1990s, which was fueled in part by the sale of conflict diamonds. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a proud and decent fisherman, is separated from his family in the unrest and forced into slavery in a diamond mine. He finds a rare pink diamond the size of a peach pit and spirits it away, becoming the centerpiece of a chase involving the smuggler, the journalist, government troops, an army of mercenaries and a rebel militiaman who has captured Solomon's oldest child and turned him into a drugged killing machine. Director Edward Zwick (""Glory,"" ""Courage Under Fire,"" ""The Last Samurai"") mounts some impressive action sequences: battles in dilapidated cities and shantytowns and chases through jungles. And DiCaprio acquits himself quite well with a broad Rhodesian accent and despite a completely stereotypical character. But Hounsou is once again forced to carry the burden of white men's guilt as a man of almost comically unsullied honor, and Connelly is awful, just awful, as the type of only-in-the-movies journalist who gets stories by flirting with sources. Look, there's no doubt that the resources of Africa have been exploited at the dear expense of the people of that benighted continent. And diamonds may in fact be the least of it. But this is the type of material best dealt with in a documentary such as ""Darwin's Nightmare"" or ""Black Gold,"" or in a melodrama populated by actual human beings such as ""The Constant Gardener."" Here, by attempting to thrill us with bang-bang action, Zwick and company seem to want to distract us from their message. And when they finally deliver it, their ham fisted treatment absolutely kills it."

","Despite having been in my film collection for a long time, I can't really explain why I haven't watched this before now. The only other movie to suffer a similar limbo-like existence is ""Jackie Brown"" which I left for so long that I traded it instead of watching it. Still, better late than never and with a film as great as this, I'm glad that I gave it a chance. Remembered mainly for Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, this is an extremely rare action in that it manages to both entertain and educate at exactly the same time. And yet somehow, it has maintained a quiet, under-the-radar aura that belies its quality.<br/><br/>Welcome to Sierra Leone in 1999, where the rebel forces of the RUF - funded by the illegal trade in conflict diamonds - engage in a bloody civil war against the government. Amid the chaos, fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is separated from his wife and family and ordered to mine for diamonds by RUF commander Captain Poison (David Harewood). After uncovering a huge pink stone and burying it, Solomon is arrested and finds himself working alongside mercenary-with-a-past Daniel Archer (DiCaprio) and American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) in order to recover both the stone and his son, captured by Poison and brainwashed into becoming yet another child soldier.<br/><br/>As I said, ""Blood Diamond"" is an action film that works on many levels. Not only is it an explosive action film with war scenes reminiscent of stuff like ""Black Hawk Down"" but it also acts as a strong message about the hidden costs of conflict diamonds and the ugly greed that captivates so many. Not only this but the acting in this movie is almost in a different league to other films in this genre - DiCaprio is simply brilliant (take it from someone who works with a lot of people from that part of the world - his accent is faultless) but he is matched every inch by Hounsou as the tortured everyman caught up in a seemingly endless nightmare. The storyline between Archer and Bowen was a tad predictable but other than that, this was an old-fashioned adventure movie with fantastic action sequences and lit up with quality in the casting.<br/><br/>It might not be the easiest film to watch - the scenes of carnage brought by the RUF, especially, are savage and brutal - but like ""Black Hawk Down"", this is a simply unmissable movie for any action fan. But by also highlighting the numerous problems with conflict diamonds and the terror they are responsible for, ""Blood Diamond"" is a lot more effective at bringing the issue to your attention than any song by Kanye West. And also like ""Black Hawk Down"", this movie seems to be rather under-rated and forgotten about for reasons I can only speculate on. This was nominated for five Oscars not that long ago and yet, I can't remember hearing anyone tell me how good this was. Maybe it's sitting in everyone else's film collection and they haven't got round to watching it yet. If so, take it from me - this is a magnificent film and one that you'll kick yourself for missing."

","Diamonds. For years they have been treated as exotic and glamorous. Maybe they are the type of things worn by high society, but the story of how they ended up on the market is one of the ugliest. ""Blood Diamond"" tells the story of several people whose lives cross due to the 1990s civil war in Sierra Leone. It begins when fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is walking his son Dia to school, when the rebels attack them. The rebels set about turning Dia into a child soldier while making Solomon mine diamonds that they use to finance their war. But Solomon manages to escape.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there's Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), an amoral jack-of-all-trades from South Africa looking to make a few bucks off of the diamonds coming from Sierra Leone. While in Sierra Leone, he meets American reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), tired of having to report on pap when there's a civil war going on in the country. But when the rebels start closing in on the capital, Solomon, Danny and Maddy have to flee together. As time passes and they look for Solomon's son, the three of them are forced to reconsider their loyalties to various causes.<br/><br/>Aside from showing the brutality inherent in Sierra Leone's civil war, the movie gives you a sense of how, in the midst of a civil war, the common people probably view the revolutionaries as no different from the dictatorship; Sierra Leone's government was pretty vile, but the rebels became just as bad. If the movie has any problem, it's that we see a lot of the events through the eyes of white people, and thus the whole issue looks sort of like another civil war in Africa. But overall, I think that the movie did a very good job showing how the diamond trade has financed some of the worst atrocities of the past ten years.<br/><br/>Also starring Arnold Vosloo (of ""The Mummy"") and Marius Weyers (of ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"")."

Actors play very well their roles, they even go beyond their parts - plus Jennifer Connelly's beauty is narcotizing - and the storytelling, though not epic, is inspiring.

What's a little disappointing and was the reason why I didn't give this movie 10/10, is that there was something missing to make that movie really great.

","Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a South African mercenary whose big dream is to find a hidden diamond which, he believes, can transform his chaotic life. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) was originally a fisherman and father of a friendly family, until a troupe of armed soldiers took him away by force to work in diamond fields. The organization uses methods which to us are unimaginable; if your hands happen to appear weak, soldiers will cut them off. If your hands are strong, they'll let you work in the fields. Solomon was lucky enough to be employed, but only to become a slave. The diamonds, meanwhile, are purchased by seemingly unknowing customers in another part of the world. Meanwhile, Solomon's son, maybe eleven years of age, is kidnapped and made into a soldier. Archer is put in jail for a while due to smuggling, where he eventually discovers that Solomon, by then also jailed, has found the valuable diamond which Archer so much wishes to possess, and buried it down somewhere in the fields. Archer insists that he'll do whatever possible to help Solomon to find his family, providing Solomon locates and gives him the diamond in return.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, as audiences, we are led to ask ourselves the old but never irrelevant question, who decides what is valuable, in one context or another? DiCaprio's character certainly seems to never give up the hope of finding the aforementioned diamond. He risks the lives of others as well as his own, children and adults alike. He is definitely persuaded by a very materialistic, even egotistical understanding of value. Yet there are flashes of empathy to be found within him, and as the tale goes on, one almost expects him to abandon the pursuit of the diamond and instead devote his thoughts to others; which does not quite happen, but completely uncaring he is not. DeCaprio does a fine job conveying his rather unpredictable nature. However, the somewhat lesser-known Djimon Hounsou truly steals the show overall, to me; as Solomon, his performance is so powerful at times that instances of somewhat stiff dialogue do not matter much.<br/><br/>BLOOD DIAMOND includes many painful scenes; child soldiers being brainwashed and very much blood, but besides being an incredibly tragic movie, it also possesses a definite layer of beauty within. The cinematography is outstanding at times, providing many beautiful landscapes. There are things in the film which may appear cliché at times, but I defy anyone not to cry a bit during the more powerful moments."

","The title of this film, Blood Diamond refers to diamonds which are harvested, smuggled out of the country and then exchanged in order to fund the procurement of weapons used in Civil War. That, in essence, is what this movie is about. Set in Sierra Leone in the early 90's when rebels were running riot, people were massacred, young children were recruited as child soldiers and men were enslaved in order to work in the diamond mines, its a harsh and scary look at how many of us (inadvertantly) acquire our bling.<br/><br/>The story revolves around, and is mainly viewed through the eyes of actor Djimon Hounsou, who portrays Solomon Vandy, a fisherman whose family is broken apart by rebels who invade his village and takes him captive to work in the mines harvesting diamonds. Its while working here that he finds a large pink stone and instead of handing it to the smugglers, he hides it.<br/><br/>This is where our story kicks off, as it is through this action, we meet Danny Archer, a diamond-smuggler played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who, whilst in prison with Solomon, hears about the diamonds existence and is determined to have it in order to quit the business.<br/><br/>Our leading lady comes in the form of the lovely Jennifer Connelly who plays a journalist looking to expose the major players in the illegal diamond trade and hooks up with Solomon and Danny in order to find the diamond and use it to get Solomons family back. The film is told in just under two and a half hours of action packed, fast paced story-telling that ends on a somewhat predictable note.<br/><br/>Although DiCaprio's character is portrayed as being interested only in personal gain, and essentially not really concerned with Solomons family because he wants the diamond for himself, there were times when it wasn't clear to me if he really was a bad guy, or someone who did in fact have some good in him. I think in the end the viewer is left to make up his/her own mind as to what they think of him.<br/><br/>Leo's accent has also been a huge point of debate. Im South African and i was impressed with the accent. I don't think it was always consistent.. but as the movie progressed, strangely it became better as he went along. At times it is easy to pick up the American, sometimes British or even Australian tones, but mostly i was really impressed. Also, its interesting to note that South Africans must have one of the more difficult accents to pinpoint, because its really flat sounding.. almost guttural, much like German. SA has 11 official languages.. so you can imagine, like Americans, different provinces have different ways of pronouncing words. But the white Afrikaaner accent is a little more straightforward. I think he did a really great job.<br/><br/>I found this film to be brutal at times in the portrayal of rebel killings by young children who are 'brainwashed' to believe that they're serving their country. Harder still to swallow is the fact that its not fiction, its happened and is still happening all over Africa. For the few children who manage to get out of the life into which they were forced, the suicide rate is high as they cannot seem to cope with the reality of the horrific crimes they were made to commit. This is the real, deep, ugly, horrific existence for many people in poorer African nations.<br/><br/>This is possibly one of DiCaprio's best performances to date, but Djimon Hounsou stole the show with his emotional and courageous portrayal of a man trying to reunite his family. DiCaprio has certainly come a long way from his days as Jack Dawson in Titanic. He has finally matured into an excellent actor. Jennifer Connelly however, was really underused and her skill as an actress not really utilized fully.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'm a huge fan of Director and Producer Edward Zwick. He knows how to make wonderfully moving films. Like he did with the Last Samurai, this movie left me feeling moved. Quality film-making at its best! Lastly, this movie may be graphic, but its a great way to open your eyes to the realities of the world. Its gruesome got me thinking about a lot of things."

","Okay so it's a Hollywood movie and so has to be entertaining. But i'm a great believer in the notion that a movie can educate. The best movies, for me, are the ones that make us think and ponder the bigger picture. I feel that many people in the west have no idea about conflict diamonds and the harrowing truth behind a percentage of the diamond trade. The film points out that we must determine where a diamond comes from before buying it and so I don't buy the stuff about the movie causing problems for the diamond industry.<br/><br/>I take my hat off to those involved with making films like this (also Lord of War, The Constant Gardner and Hotel Rwanda) as the enlighten us on the way the west can exploit Africa. Sure, there are other places in the world that deserve our sympathy and attention, but the magnitude and scale of the atrocities that have faced/face Africa should not go untold. We don't pay attention to the stories on the news and so at least we cant ignore it for long thanks to such movies. The child soldier stuff is particularly horrible and it really is time people did more to figure out how to combat that problem.<br/><br/>Leo is great as always. Good film, lets now check out antislavery.org or amnesty and prove that Hollywood can inspire and bring out the greater good in our hearts..."

"IRateFilms","8","2","4","9 December 2006"," Blood Diamond is a true Gem.
","What can I say? Edward Zwick has mastered a phenomenal challenge to bring awareness to movie goers embellishing political blasphemy and socio-economic curtailment of life regarding blood diamonds. Leonardo DiCaprio's acting career has reveled in subjects that perhaps not many have come to really appreciate. He is not ""just"" an actor. He is trying to ferment the actualization that there is a major and disturbing reality of corruption and death in countries worldwide, and whilst doing so has brought forth a deep meaning of self-reliance, when attempting to embellish his role playing. DiCaprio has surely defined himself as an action star, with more finesse and confidence than anyone working in that field today.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond visualizes the physical deprivation of humanity, through the limb dismemberment and massacre of the Sierra Leone people. It truly exemplifies how individuals wielding a gun on a pick-up truck can claim themselves as a revolutionary, no matter what the age group. This film only scratches the surface of the growing problems in Africa, describing these problems with a simple acronym, TIA, standing for This Is Africa, an internationally mutilated abyss.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou, who has been appropriately typecast as the African fisherman, delivers a heartfelt, honest and tear inducing performance. DiCaprio and Hounsou's performances will definitely be worthy of the proverbial Oscar nod this year. How many actors do we know that can make his audience feel what he sees with his eyes. Unfortunately, Jennifer Connelly brings one her most dull performances, never coming close to the caliber of acting that surrounds her. Blood Diamond delivers direct assertions as a socio-political thriller, and hopefully this will be another jab at the sheer evasion of this much ignored topic."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","2","4","9 December 2006"," Brilliant all around...powerful, intense, and thrilling. One of my all time favorites
","Blood Diamond is among the most impactful films of recent memory. It ranks up there with films such as Schindler's List and United 93. Similar to United 93, Blood Diamond brings into focus an atrocity which is affecting our world now: the struggle for control of the diamonds in Africa. This film focuses on the perspectives of a diamond smuggler named Danny Archer (Oscar Nominee Leonardo DiCaprio), a fisherman called Solomon Vandy (Oscar Nominee Djimon Hounsou), and a journalist named Maddy Bowen (Oscar Winner Jennifer Connelly) as they struggle to understand each other during a search for the Blood Diamond in the middle of war torn Africa. After Solomon is separated from his family after a rebel invasion, he discovers the blood diamond, which he quickly hides during another rebel attack. Soon after, Archer recruits him to find the diamond with the promise that he'll see his family again.<br/><br/>The film does not pull any punches when showing us the conflict between the governments of Africa and the rebels plotting to overthrow them. We also get brief glimpses of the political side of the conflict, but it is mostly the up close and personal violence. This film is not for the faint of heart in that the violence and subject are not physically overdone (there is a fair share of graphic violence and gore), but the are emotionally disturbing. Most of the violence involves children and unimaginably cruel men.<br/><br/>The acting behind Blood Diamond is among the best of the year, without a doubt. Only 'The Departed' can boast this kind of talent. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply brilliant as Danny Archer, the flawed, intelligent, and dedicated smuggler who will stop at nothing to get the diamond. DiCaprio gives us the best character of the year, a character motivated by greed and desperation, but one who is still human and can feel after witnessing so much horror in his life. DiCaprio commands the screen and your attention for the entire film. Easily his best performance of his career. DiCaprio disappears into the role of Danny Archer, and many times you'll have to remind yourself that it's him...Archer is, at times, scary and emotionless, but at the same time, DiCaprio shows that he is a truly good person. With one of the most powerful performances I've seen, Djimon Hounsou will blow you away with is amazing and emotional performance. I believe he should have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar over Alan Arkin (no knocking Arkin, he was great). Hounsou already has the reputation for this kind of thing, but he blew me out of the water with his performance in the film. His role as the man who is as dedicated to finding his family as Archer is to finding the diamond is so emotional and gut wrenching, that it's not hard to love him. Hounsou and DiCaprio feed off each other in a way that makes their roles even more believable. They both disappear into their roles and make this film brilliant. Jennifer Connelly is, as usual, excellent. While she is absent from most of the film, she is great whenever she gets on there. She has good chemistry with DiCaprio, and their early meetings provide us with some comic relief. Like Hounsou and DiCaprio, Connelly's character is extremely dedicated. All three of the characters are very similar: they are all truly good people, all of them are dedicated to their goal, no matter what the cost, and all three of them change somewhat throughout the film.<br/><br/>Edward Zwick's work on this film rivals his work on Glory and The Last Samurai, and that is saying something. The music is one of the key parts of the film, as it makes the scenes even more powerful. The mood of the film is established perfectly by Zwick. Once the film gets going, you'll know exactly what it's about. Another great thing that Zwick does is that he makes the messages and themes easily visible to us as an audience. Those themes are dedication and survival. With Blood Diamond, Zwick brings to the stage an issue that is silently affecting the world. These wars in Africa have been reduced, but not been eliminated. With the graphic violence and emotionally moving acting, the foursome of Zwick, DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly have constructed a film that stands for so much more than just an adventure film. I recommend Blood Diamond to all age 17 and older, but those who couldn't take Schindler's List or United 93 probably won't be able to take this either. It is a truly impactful and important film. A must see.<br/><br/>10/10 --spy"
"memestef","9","2","4","9 December 2006"," The story you won't see on the evening news
","There was no exaggeration I felt in either the terror on the streets or countryside, the brutal conscription of child soldiers, the absolute chaos, or the real back alley diamond trading industry. All the real life stories that never make the 6 pm news. Having lived in Africa for 4 years, it rang too true. I used to think that what was unseen was worse because of what you imagined. What we saw painted a very vivid picture of everything that we've read and heard. It is graphically sobering and shocking.<br/><br/>I cannot believe I am saying this, but I really really liked Leo Dicaprio. He played the Rhodesian Afrikanner perfectly. My husband and I both looked at each other, and said, yikes we know people like this. He had the speech down pat too- ""is it"", ""lekker"",""kaffir"", ""bru"" for bro, etc.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connely was awful. Although when she wasn't flirting with Leo, she did make some acute observations. And as it always tends to be, the love interest story was a bit contrived. And there were some Hollywoodizations that did not seems to fit - like how a Sierra Leonian gets out of the country without papers, or how Leo takes on the SA mercenaries, or how easily the family reunites. Oh that it were that easy in real life.<br/><br/>Djimon Houssou was incredible. You may remember him from Amistad. Oscar? It was filmed in South Africa and Mozambique. We recognized a lot of the landscape and buildings. There was some shots in Sierra Leone too and you can see what a beautiful country it is.<br/><br/>There is quite of bit of historical context and current events with facts and figures that set the stage. It makes it feel more authentic.<br/><br/>No doubt there is a guilt trip attached to the film, but we both felt like it was one worth handing out. Whether it is food or clothes or diamonds, people in general don't seem to care where it comes from or under what circumstances, as long as it is a bargain or serves them well.<br/><br/>Overall, we would have to say we would recommend it for its social message."

And despite becoming famous with a pretty face, Leonardo is a very capable actor and potentially one of the great actors of his generation. Jennifer Connolly pulls her own weight. The standout is Djimon Hounsou, who ultimately carries much of the movie.<br/><br/>There are definitely moments when the special effects remind one of Apocalypse Now, but in this case, the action includes the main characters in most scenes, making the intensity of effect all the more real. <br/><br/>The child who plays Dia is also to be noted, as he acts both in words and facial effects, in a role that must truly risk emotional scarring. <br/><br/>All-in-all, one of the top ten movies of the year, in my estimation."

","I'm continually surprised at the maturation of Leonardo DiCaprio... his performances in the Aviator and The Departed were simply amazing, yet to some of the general fan base of cinema, he continues to be thought of as just another pretty boy teen beat cover story... this film marks yet another unforgettable performance from DiCaprio. Along with his performance in the Departed, the Aviator, Gangs of New York, What's eating Gilbert Grape, and even Catch me if you Can and Romeo and Juliet... Blood Diamond joins the list of films where Leonardo DiCaprio proves he's one of America's top actors today, if not THE top leading man..... <br/><br/>Now I guess if I have one complaint it would have to be I guess the accent he uses, but it's more or less one hundred percent accurate...it's just that everyone's accent from that region is a little hard to bare so... I don't blame leo, in fact I only brought this up because it might tire for some and it's really my only complaint, but is in no means a major factor to whether or not you'll like this film... <br/><br/>Also, as I've said, I think Leo's performance in The Departed was simply amazing, and I hope he wins a best actor Oscar for it, but after seeing that movie I thought Jack Nicholson was the leading candidate for this years bestsupporting Actor Oscar....that is not true anymore. Djimon Honsou'sperformance in Blood diamond is probably the best supporting performance I've seen this year... it's arguably the best ofhis career in a career full of great performances...

","This film was eye-opening for me, especially as a young college student born in 2000 when civil conflicts were still prevalent in Africa. During the 1990's, owning, selling, and moving diamonds in Western Africa were seen as the pinnacle for success for any ordinary man willing to take the risk. Blood diamonds, also known as conflict diamonds, destroyed villages, cities, and communities through gangs or mafias with the main goal of hunting down the stones. Set in Sierra Leone off the West Coast of Africa, the film Blood Diamond captures the raw, horrific, and inhumane violence that took place during their civil wars. Children were recruited to arm weapons and trained to kill. Tens of thousands of innocent women and children were murdered during this time period when blood diamonds were at their peak for sparking conflict. This past semester in college, I was able to learn about what global challenges are, and how we can create solutions for them. The definition of global challenges resembles this idea: the major issues within our planet are so large and complex that not only one institution or force can address the issue properly. A collection of causes coming together, synthesizing information, and creating a coherent mission statement for a solution is required to attend to a global issue. Examples of global challenges include, wastes, food management, climate change, global finance, the internet, and the list goes on. These issues require maximum efforts from governments, states, nations, and powerful men and women. This newly acquired knowledge has affected me in many ways. I now have a broader world view, and better understanding of the world around me. I am able to correctly identify what is a true concern for a region while also understanding the scale of that issue. I have learned to write effectively on the problems that we face as humans, and the possible solutions that can come from them. I found that I was not as aware as I once was, but now I have a stronger thirst for knowledge than I did before. I am also learning that the more knowledge you gain, the more power you have in discussions and catching people's claims that may not be true or well supported. Many global challenges related to the Seven Revolutions are revealed throughout the film. Diamonds, obviously, can be considered a resource - revolution 2. Many of the diamonds found in Sierra Leone were illegally exported and integrated into the flow of legal diamonds and into the world market. Many middle men will profit down the line because of how their processes operate, creating conflicts if deals are not done properly. Governance, revolution 7, plays a large role in Sierra Leone's economic downfall and corruption. Terrorist groups take entire cities at a time while the state's military infantry struggles to gain a single victory against them. This film functions as a great educational tool for learning of the events that occurred before my lifetime, and the importance of this knowledge. This films adds to my motivation for providing medical help to the people of Africa and other areas of the world. My passion for missionary work was strengthened from what I saw in this accurate depiction. I plan to do all that I can to abstain from adopting a completely Americanized culture and strive for diversifying my life, meeting new people, and contributing to the overall global health of less fortunate communities."

","Brutal conflicts over natural resources have been a fundamental component of African life for several generations. Fueled by the western need for resources, most of the combatants have been Africans that have claimed the same national allegiance. The companies and governments of the western nations understand how the battles are being carried out and the level of human carnage, but generally are only interested in maintaining the production.
The setting is the African nation of Sierra Leone in 1999, when there was an outbreak of a brutal civil war. Men and boys are forcibly recruited by rebel groups to work in the diamond mines and any attempt to steal a diamond leads to execution. The armed groups regularly enter villages suspected of allegiance to the other side and shoot down innocents, rape the women and will cut off the limbs of children in order to make a point.
Leonardo di Caprio plays Danny Archer, a Rhodesian veteran of the wars in Southern Africa and now a diamond smuggler. Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a fisherman in a village of Sierra Leone when the civil war breaks out in earnest. A rebel group attacks his village and while his wife and youngest children manage to escape, Vandy is captured and forced to work in the diamond mines. He discovers a monstrous stone and when he is about to be forced to turn it over to his overlord, government troops attack and Solomon manages to bury the stone before being captured.
Archer has been arrested while attempting to smuggle diamonds across the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia and ends up in the same prison as Vandy. This is the spark of an unlikely alliance between the two men. Archer is a man that is at times as ruthless as the people he is fighting, yet he does retain a spark of humanity. The remainder of the story has the two men on a hunt to recover the diamond by any means necessary.
The violence in the movie is significant, but it does genuinely reflect what was going on in Africa at the time. Entire villages were being wiped out, children were being impressed into armed groups to serve as ruthless soldiers and the diamond companies mostly stood back unless they considered it necessary to send in their mercenary units. The best aspect of the movie is that it genuinely reflects what took place in Africa.
One of the best lines in the movie references the historical fact that the Belgian controllers of the Congo implemented a policy of cutting off the hands of workers in order to keep them terrified and working. Given that a bounty for scalps has been a part of law of the European based governments in the United States for centuries, the point is that the acts of barbarism towards enemies has a lot of European origins.
This is a movie that entertains and educates and should be viewed in classes that cover the colonization and how corporations operate in countries unable to resist them."

","For years, I had heard about Blood Diamond (2006) from a variety of different viewpoints. Many friends would mention it about either Leonardo DiCaprio's accent, the tense action, or the diamond industry as a whole. After a while, I made it a point to eventually see this film, even if I wasn't sure when that would be. It took a while, but I did eventually have this chance, and I'm glad that I took it. Sure, Blood Diamond is a little difficult to watch in the sense that there are aspects of the African diamond industry that are straight-up human rights violations. However, it is important to know these things are going on to become informed about our world.<br/><br/>The fact that there have been (and likely still are) child soldiers being brainwashed by ruthless rebels to overthrow the governments in Africa is a sobering thing to watch and a heartbreaking realization when you see how it plays out when a father and son are separated. Much of the problem comes down to the diamond industry forcing a high value on these objects that are a manufactured scarcity by the companies profiting off the bloodshed and destruction of these African nations.<br/><br/>While Blood Diamond isn't entirely perfect (it has its fair share of clichÃ©s and tropes), it is something I think most people in the United States should watch. Sure, the 1999 setting might be a little out of date 20 years later, but how are we to know that these conditions still don't exist over there? Some laws may have been passed to help stem the flow of blood diamonds into the system, but there are plenty of ways around these restrictions.

","So far, if I remember something of this summer 2010, it would be that I discovered Jennifer Connelly and her filmography thanks to the Net and one halo effect.<br/><br/>And the beginning is rather extraordinary! ""Blood Diamond"" is a brilliant, masterful eye-opener!<br/><br/>Living in France doesn't allow understanding the tragedies in Africa. Here, the movie being shot in real locations helped change this. Misery isn't only an over-populated people that haven't anything but it also derelict towns. Thus, human life is despised and allows extraordinary slaughters similar of those of WWII and the dreadful recruiting of children soldiers. In this nightmare, our opulent nations don't step in but rather exploit and steal the only wealth left. It was really shocking to see that people are ready for anything to get those little brilliant rocks and lock them afterward to keep prices up.<br/><br/>Thus, Di Caprio embodies an active link in this monstrous chain because he is the collector of the diamonds. He doesn't have a good guy to play (it's rather Hounsoun) but he delivers such a finely shaded characterization that in spite of doing adults deeds, you can feel his fragility and that he is still a child inside. His meeting with Jenny changed him but as the story is fast paced due to the revolutionary fights in the entire country, he has no time to ponder what happens to him until he discovered that he has nothing left.<br/><br/>His final moments ranks among my best movies farewell of all time that includes so far ""Blade Runner"" for its poetry, ""Godfather III"" for its pain and ""Knowing"" for its family sharing. Here, it starts with the numbing wound that Di Caprio plays brilliantly and ends with the phone call that couldn't happen twenty years ago. It's a very emotional and unique passing away and it made me cry.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I understand now why DiCaprio is among the best. He isn't no more the brat of his beginning and he makes me forgot Jenny! Thanks to him, to her and the wonderful team production to giving us such beauty and hard truths!"

","The film Blood Diamond directed by Edward Zwick combines Explosions, helicopters, and action to portray the serious problem of illegal diamonds being smuggled, bought and sold by the united states.
Starring leonardo dicaprio, he plays the role of a white South African mercenary who finds himself in the middle of a civil war raging throughout sierra leone Africa in the 90s. He meets a black Mende fisherman who had found a precious gem that is bigger than anyone has ever seen, but had been separated from his family in the war and sets out to find them. They also meet an american journalist along the way who is in africa to make a story about this ongoing problem with illegal diamonds. With three different goals these three work together to solve each others problems. It starts and ends with a rigorous trek through the rebel territory of sierra leone.
Although the movie doesn't have any narrative surprises, it allows you to know where the movie is going which makes it all the better. Reason being is that what you think is going to happen, happens. As a viewer it gives you a sense of relief almost because you can enjoy watching without having to stress out about it. The acting by leonardo dicaprio is spectacular making the film captivating to the person who is watching. Really draws you into his character.
At times I would wonder why im watching the film due to some of the horrifying visuals that are shown, but then I realize that these are things are actually happening around the world. Although some of the action in the film is far fetched the film does a good job of showing an issue that is going on that people may not even know about. The sound effects and music in the film were a huge part of the story line. Without the loud explosions and tribal music etc it would not be able to justify just how real this issue is. The sound also keeps the pace of the movie at a constant speed with music. With the movie being at a constant speed the whole time I never once wanted to take my eyes off the screen because I was afraid of missing a pivotal point in a scene, which made the movie more enjoyable to watch. As great as this movie is, it lacks the storytelling of the characters backgrounds. The characters in the film are not introduced with any background whatsoever, which makes it hard to relate to them and have a connection to the character. They make up with this throughout the film by making you have a deep emotional connection to the characters. Another movie produced by Edward Zwick is The Last Samurai featuring tom cruise. It is filled with action packed scenes along with the same concept that there is a problem that needs to be solved. This movie is a drama war film and if you liked blood diamond you would surely love this film.
Blood Diamond has a very aggressive approach to the theme in which makes the reader think. Everyone one in this film is set out on a common quest to find something they are longing for. They do this by having all types of characters, they have heros, villians, and even a sympathetic protagonist. This helps further the theme and bring light to the problem, which is conflict diamonds."

"mundhra_mayank","9","0","0","5 February 2018"," TIA: This Is Africa
","A story about the violence over resources in the worst affected continent of the world, the film is great in capturing the nerve of everything that is wrong in Africa by means of characters who are there for different reasons. <br/><br/>The story revolves around the main characters who represent the different agents at work in Sierra Leone, a country on the brink of a coup by extremists. The movie begins with Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) who is captured by the extremists as a worker to mine for diamonds. The warlords buy guns by selling these diamonds to Dicaprio (Danny Archer) who is a smuggler in cahoots with the diamond industry and the army. Djimon comes across a huge diamond which Dicaprio gets interested. Meanwhile Maddy Bowen(Jennifer Connelly) is a journalist following the story of blood diamonds and gets involved in the whole mess.<br/><br/>This is a great movie from director Edward Zwick, who is successful in portraying the alternate views on Africa through the characters. Here's my 5 points:<br/><br/>1. The central thing to Blood Diamond is the characters. Both Djimon and Dicaprio were nominated to the Academy awards and rightly so. Dicaprio does a South African accent an you love everytime he says ""bru"". He jus plays a smooth badass smuggler who knows how to deal with the government, the army and the bandits. Djimon on the other hand plays a very strong character who is looking to reunite with his family. The actors have their heart in the characters they are playing and they seem very realistic. <br/><br/>2. Dialogues are seldom great in movies not based on books, but not blood diamond. A movie dealing with such a serious topic, with characters who so strongly believe in their version of Africa, has to be driven by great dialogues. All the violence around them has shaped not just heir beliefs but also their view of the world which is reflected in the words they speak, like when Dicaprio says ""God has long ago forsaken this land."" Watch this once more just for the dialogues.<br/><br/>3. Zwick does a great directorial job. Had this movie not involved so much of violence, right from the start to the end, this could have very well been a great adventure movie. The characters are constantly on the run through a maze of army and terrorists to reach the diamond, seems like a plot for a video game. And during all this there is the recurrent theme of Djimon trying to be a family man he is supposed to be. Zwick does keep the flame of positivity alive by using this angle.<br/><br/>4. Music wise, the movie is awesome. They did not try to get a very African type of music which often is the case with movies based in Africa. That would have suited a movie based on African culture. Here the role of the music and background score was the aid the narrative, not be the narrative itself. Blood diamond got 2 Academy Award and one Grammy nomination for the sound and you know why when you watch this. It changes its tone as the movie changes its tone very beautifully, as the movie shifts gears from violence to action to emotions in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>Over all, the movie is great if you're in mood for some power packed performances and action. Watch it on with a set of big headphones on!"

","No doubt one of the greatest movies ever made. It has pretty much everything you could want from a movie (of the action thriller genre). The acting is top notch, notably from the fantastic duo of DiCaprio and Hounsou, DiCaprio already being one of my favourite actors of all time is incredible as always, but I gotta say Hounsou really steals the show with this one. His portrayal of Solomon Vandy is moving to say the least, having seen the movie several times, his performance never fails to bring me to tears. And let's not overlook the acting of Jennifer Connelly who also did a fantastic job and the great chemistry created between her and DiCaprio, and even Kuyper's depiction of Dia is wonderful. So great acting all across the board.<br/><br/>The movie flows beautifully, it never feels like it drags, and although it feature a lot of dialogue it's never difficult to follow what's going on. It's the perfect balance of action and narrative, a very deep story which at no point feels convoluted, and the icing on the cake is that the story is meaningful, that is, it morally tells a very important story which sends a strong message. Zwick's directing is captivating, and it's no wonder that he's also the director of The Last Samurai (also a fantastic movie), which makes me feel like I should explore some more of his work. In an era where cinema is arguably a dying art, it's a rare case for a film of this caliber to be released, and still over 10 years later it remains one of my top films of all time."

","Blood Diamond Is directed by Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai) and takes place in Sierra Leone. The movie follows two protagonists Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) and Danny Archer (Leonard DiCaprio), the former a fisherman, separated from his family by the civil war, and the latter a sly diamond smuggler. Solomon is being forced by the rebels to look for diamonds and stumbles on a pretty big one. When Archer finds out about the diamond, they form an unlikely partnership to help each other out: a diamond for Archer and a family for Solomon.<br/><br/>Let's get the obvious out of the way first: the performances by DiCaprio and Hounsou are brilliant. Hounsou gives an overall restrained performance but knows exactly when and how to explode. DiCaprio is at least Oscar worthy, nails the foreign accent of his character and outshines in the subtle portrayal of his emotions. The best parts of the movie take place when those two characters are together, the chemistry works and provides us with thrilling and funny scenes. <br/><br/>The movie is one big, epic adventure through the country of Sierra Leone. The civil war that's raging in the country ensures a constant menacing atmosphere. The violence is brutal: wives and children are being butchered, hands and arms are being chopped, the rebels know no mercy. When a little boy tries to hide a diamond while working for the rebels and the leader (Captain Poison, played by David Harewood) notices, this menacing atmosphere surely raises the tension.<br/><br/>The movie also tries to convey a message about the materialism in the first world. Everybody wants diamonds, but doesn't really care where they come from. When journalists write about it, people care for a minute, but nothing changes. When Solomon naively asks journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) if people would come help when she publishes her story, she cynically laughs and says 'no'. The movie could have benefited from delving deeper into this materialism and ignorance towards the state of affairs in the countries supplying their gadgets that they so badly want but not need. <br/><br/>Blood Diamond takes you on a at times fun, and at times shocking, devastating ride through a devastated Sierra Leone. The conclusion of the movie is satisfying and the great soundtrack surely helps with that. Being 2 hours and 23 minutes long, there were surely some sequences that didn't really add much to the story and could have been left out. Also, I wonder if this movie would have been as interesting without the charismatic Hounsou and DiCaprio."

Viewers can see how Archer is desperately trying to leave his old life behind while somehow always managing to find himself right in the middle of the action. <br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly also had a great performance as the lovable Maddy Bowen. She is sharp and quick witted as her character is an awe of how bad life is in Sierra Leone. Her acting in this movie rivals that of her Oscar winning performance in A Beautiful Mind.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou plays a native born fisherman, Solomon Vandy, perfectly.

Alright the 'Baddy' is only one of a few companies but the formula they use is quite close to real life to keep the price high. There are far more stones than the lords and ladies think there is in the world and it hit on the fact about the big vaults containing loads of diamonds to keep them off the market; therefore driving the price up as it makes them seem less obtainable ! It is most likely true that there are more diamonds in one of the major players vaults than in the free market and if they were made available- The market would crash as it would be saturated by these 'Rare' stones."

A black family man named Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) and a persistent female journalist with good intentions Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly). When Sierra Leone is taken over by rebel soldiers, these three characters find themselves by dangerous circumstances needing each others help to get what they after. As Danny Archer's relationship with Maddy and Solomon grows he begins to see life in a whole new way. The film has excellent story, subtext, stunning locations, interesting characters and amazing acting performances by the cast. This has to be Edward Zwicks number one film. With some of the best and most versatile work to date by DiCaprio, showing his excellent skill of the Rhodesian accent.

","The diamond trade in Africa is one of the most depressing and saddening struggles the modern world is experiencing. People are killed over diamonds and are put into dangerous working conditions that have extreme punishments for the manufactures. Realistic fiction is a powerful way to bring up this current issue, and Edward Zwick directs ""Blood Diamond"" in perfection with a strong cast and roller-coaster of a plot. Leonardo Dicaprio stars as a Rhodesian diamond smuggler named Danny Archer who works for a corrupt diamond company in London. While vising in Sierra Leone in order to confiscate diamonds, he comes in contact with Solomon Vandy, a fisherman played powerfully by Djimon Houson who lost his son by rebels who turn him into a child soldier. However, Vandy was able to find a huge pink diamond that he buried for safety. Archer makes him a deal to find his son if he gets the diamond. The two men team up with a beautiful journalist played by Jennifer Connelly who works to get a story about diamond smuggling. All three characters are deeply moved by their experiences. This film covers so many boundaries and is filmed in a kinetic and powerful way. Edward Zwick gets mind-blowing footage of Sierra Leone and focuses on the sorrow and the beauty of the dangerous lands. He captures spectacular wildlife and culture as well as extreme violence that will leave you speechless. Some scenes in Blood Diamond are very hard to watch, while others are used for exciting entertainment that is balanced excellently. The editing is very strong that has excellent sound and visual effects, but also gets footage evenly and lengths each scene to help organize the heavy plot. Every actor is spectacular. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a flawless performance who shows a two-sided man that you will love and hate throughout the compelling story. Djimon Houson is excellent and is a very likable man that will make you feel for him in scenes where he looses his emotions. ""Blood Diamond"" takes on a saddening issue that needs attention. This film has a perfect ending but is a dream of what the ending results will be. With excellent entertainment, film making and impeccable character development, ""Blood Diamond"" stirs up the attention the dark continent needs in order to assure peace and will give the audience a powerful and perfectly constructed work of cinematic nature."

Danny values the diamond so much, Solomon value his family more than diamonds, Maddy just want to show the world the real scenario of the diamond in conflict, The RUF.s for their survival even to the point of killing their own fellow Africans. Just like fame, fortune and money, diamonds became the root of those evils but it was not the diamonds but the man's action towards diamonds makes it evil or not. The whole story pushed me to do my part and be an instrument of peace not only within my family but also to those people whom I can reach out.

"jfbarrett2477","9","0","0","26 March 2014"," Joe Barrett's Blood Diamond review
","The film Blood Diamond is one of the best films that I have seen. This film tells a story about what goes on in Africa while Americans are so oblivious to all of the crime and killings occurring. These people have nothing. Everyday for them is a fight to survive. They struggle to find food and shelter daily because they are so often forced out of their homes. The government has so little control of the rebels, also known as the RUF in this film. The movie Blood Diamond directed by Edward Zwick and written by Charles Leavitt. The film was made in 2006. The main actors are Leonardo Dicaprio, Djimon Hounsou, and Jennifer Connelly. Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy. He is a fisherman who's home gets raided and family taken from him. He finds a large diamond and hides it. The film is about him trying to find the diamond, but more importantly his family. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Danny Archer. He is a smuggler who gets arrested and meets Solomon in jail. He hears about this diamond and wants to use Solomon so he can take it and get out of Africa. Jennifer Connelly plays Maddy Bowen. She is a reporter from America trying to tell the people of America about life in Africa, while Americans are only interested in the Bill Clinton sex scandal. The film starts out showing Solomon walking with his son back to their village from a day of fishing. The RUF, rebels, storm the village killing or taking hostage everyone. Solomon's life is spared because he can work. He is taken to a river where he searches for diamonds. He finds a massive one and hides it. He meets up with Danny Archer when they both are set free from jail. Danny hears about the diamond and wants to use him to find the diamond. So they set out searching for the diamond and also Solomon's family who was taken during the RUF. I would definitely recommend this movie. It is a good movie filled with action. There is drama and suspense throughout the film. The actors did a wonderful job is displaying the true horrific events that occur daily in African countries. This film is not only very entertaining, but it also raises a big moral issue. Should the Americans send troops or money to African countries to help them through these struggles? Give this film a chance and see if it changes your opinion."

","It is the late 1990s and a group of rebels is attacking villages in the West African nation of Sierra Leone in order to capture people to make them harvest diamonds. The political unrest within this part of Africa has stirred up a lot of attention in the diamond industry overseas, thereby creating an extended diamond market for these African rebel groups. One man has dedicated his life to the smuggling of precious materials and gained information that a worker in one of the rebel camps had found an enormous pink diamond; something that could be worth a fortune. This man is Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio). Archer sees this as an opportunity to become rich and quickly seizes it, manipulating anyone he can in order to have his way culminating in an exciting journey in which Archer discovers who his true self is. <br/><br/>Blood Diamond, created by The Bedford Falls Virtual Studios Initial Entertainment group, directed by Edward Zwick in December, 2006, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly, and Djimon Hounsou, received a rating of 8/10 and tells the story about the ravaging of villages throughout West Africa in order to find able-bodied men to harvest diamonds, as well as the story of what it is like to live in a place with a government full of corruption and disorganization.<br/><br/>The movie follows the life of Solomon Vandy, a man who is taken away from his family after his village gets ransacked by rebels in order to work as someone who looks for diamonds, and Danny Archer, a smuggler. In the beginning of the movie, Vandy's camp gets attacked and he is able to escape. From this point on the movie shifts between the two perspectives of Vandy and Archer until they finally meet and agree to go find a very large diamond that Vandy said that he found while working at the camp. Another character important to the story is Maddy Bowen, a journalist from America who wants to write a story on the diamond trade going on between Africa and the rest of the world. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the most interesting part of the movie was the character development of Archer. In the beginning of the movie, he seems to only care about his work and earning money. Later on in the movie this changes dramatically. DiCaprio's depiction of a man who has witnessed only hatred and greed in his life adds to the sense of reality in the basis of the movie. Another thing that I really liked about the movie was that the story is based off of real events. These are real problems going on right now in Africa so there is a true message being sent out to the viewers of this movie.<br/><br/>If you are someone who is adamant about helping others or even what life is like in the rest of the world then I would recommend this movie to you. The glimpse that we see into a completely different way of living and how it is corrupted by the weakness of the government speaks not only to people who take interest in international affairs and world relations, but to all people who believe that the world is a place that should be enjoyed living in."

","Rating:8/10<br/><br/>Blood Diamond is a film that was released in 2006, taken place in Sierra Leone during a civil war. The movie focuses in on two people, Solomon Vandy and Danny Archer. Solomon Vandy is an innocent Fisherman, is captured by the Rebels and is forced to work in the Diamond fields while being taken away from his family. Every slave working in the Diamond field is required to give the diamonds to the commander. Solomon finds a diamond and digs it in the ground while the military comes and invades the ground. In prison Danny Archer, a diamond smuggler, teams up with Solomon Vandy to go an find the big diamond that he left behind. While all of this is happening, Solomon's son, who he envisions becoming a doctor, is kidnapped to becoming a child solider. Solomon and Archer go on a quest to find his son and the diamonds. Sacrifices are made and identities are lost. <br/><br/>I really like how the director showed how children are corrupted by rebels and are forced to do things against their will at first but then the director shows how the children start embracing that lifestyle. I really like how their were two quests Solomon Vandy had to go to through to get his family back. The diamond for Solomon was a decoy to what he really wants which is his family. I really like how at the end the director shows that Solomon's son is still corrupted and he doesn't even know his true identity. I also like how the audiences view on Danny Archer changed throughout the movie. At first he was using Solomon to find the diamond, but then he realizes what really is important which is Solomon's family. <br/><br/>I think it doesn't deserve 10/10 of stars because I think the director made the ending too clichÃ© by making Danny Archer sacrifice himself. I know thats the ending the audience wants, but the director could of added a huge twist to the end of the movie to make the ending more intense."

","Blood Diamond Movie Review Overall Rating: 9.5<br/><br/>The movie Blood Diamond was a fabulous movie. It was filled with suspense, violence, action, as well as heartfelt connections that are built with Solomon Vandy and his family. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, I was constantly kept on the edge of my seat by the action packed scenes with the village being captured, the gun violence, and the fear of any of the characters dying at any moment. The movie does have scenes with blood and gore, but not an excessive amount, keeping it suitable for almost all audiences. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, as Danny, and Djimon Hounsou, as Solomon, were both incredible actors throughout and always kept me entertained. Leo used his accent very well, making him a likable character in my perspective. <br/><br/>As for the love aspect of the movie, I felt very bad for Solomon and the loss of his family and repeatedly hoped that he would make it through the attacks and violent scenes in order to find his family and his captured son, Dia, who he had high hopes for to one day be a doctor. Danny Archer picks up an interesting relationship with a reporter that comes in, Maddy Bowen, who follows him around trying to get as much information out of him as possible in order to help educate the rest of the world about the current situation there in Africa. <br/><br/>Overall, Blood Diamond has to be one of my favorite movies. It has just enough action, relationships, and shocking scenes to keep me interested the whole time and make me grow attachments to many of the characters throughout. I would recommend this movie to all audiences, and also mention that not only is it a great movie but it is also very educational towards the problem that is still happening across the world with the blood diamond industry."
"rocketarm1","8","0","0","26 March 2014"," Blood Diamond raises questions
","Movie Review ""Blood Diamond"" a film filed with drama and adventure that shows just how many different forces are involved in Africa's armed conflicts and suggests how people can take action in preventing it. Premiering in early December of 2006 the film gave audiences something to look into, besides the seriousness of South African poverty. Edward Zwick, the director has set the stage for leading actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou, Jennifer Connelly on a mission to understand the immensity of this armed conflict through finding Honsou's family, but more importantly what everyone wants, the blood diamond. The film brings clarity to the conflict in Sierra Leone during the 1990s, the civil war that caused immense suffering and destruction to Africa. Leonardo DiCaprio, a lead actor, plays a South African mercenary and his current job in which the movie shows that he is a diamond smuggler. His merges with Djimon Hounsou as a fisherman who is separated from his family and enslaved to become a part of the rebels in their search for diamonds. That is where he finds an immensely large pink diamond which ties everyone together the rest of the movie. The two run into each other in a jail cell when a rebel commander interrogates him about the diamonds location, sparking the interest of DiCaprio. Hounosu agrees that in order to get his family back he must go with DiCaprio to find this Diamond, and bring an end to the search. The plot mostly consists of the journey to finding this diamond along with some action points along the way to keep you interested in following the storyline. However, there is also a sub-plot that takes place and that's where Connelly comes into play. A journalist from the states trying to discover the means behind the conflict of the diamond smuggling and bring interest from people in the United States to take action against this behind closed door trade. She agrees to help DiCaprio in the interest of finding out the truth behind this diamond trade, and they help each other towards both their goals. The movie also sheds light on the brutally of the civil war at the time showing young children firing automatic weapons at income people, brainwashed by the rebels, they do exactly as told. There is a lot going on through which the main plot carries the movie, and raises awareness to both issues in Africa and issues throughout trade in the world today. Apart from the main plot, it is important to not overlook the subtleties that the movie adds in while it explains the conflict during this harsh time in Africa. There are so many different angles to look at in this movies it's hard not to miss them all, and it's important to understand that what fuels conflicts in these types of environments is not just the people that live there. Raising awareness to the diamond trade that European and American countries are through other means, supplying these rebel groups brings up a great dispute. Especially when these diamonds aren't even being used do to keep people paying top dollar, when in fact slaves are digging them up from the ground. IN my opinion ""Blood Diamond"" is defiantly a movie to watch if you haven't seen it already, or possibly to watch again in case you missed some of the minor details when you were watching the bullets fly across the screen. As far as age group I would defiantly give it an R, just due to the brutal scenes that the movie depicts, and defiantly not a good movie to watch if you're in a bad mood. I rather enjoyed it because although I have a trust for action it also gave a little more plot than most action movies have. I also really enjoyed how the movie was presented; leading you into it step by step pulling you further in as the movie unfolds. I would give it a sold 8/10."

","Two unlikely partners; one a diamond smuggler for life, the other a humble fisherman are on the run from rebel African forces and government troops as well. In their possession is a priceless stone, they both realize lives have been altered and ended for much less. This is the story of Blood Diamond, a tale in which strangers are forced to trust each other with their lives as they are pursued for what is rightfully theirs.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond, directed by Edward Zwick. tells the story of Archer, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and Solomon, played by Djimon Hounsou. It was released in 2006, and I would rate it as an 8 of 10. Blood Diamond is, quite simply, the story of two men's journey because of a enormous diamond. Archer is a diamond smuggler, who specializes in buying diamonds from African rebel groups who illegally obtain these diamonds. Solomon is a fisher whose son is taken and forced into their military and who is forced to mine for diamonds, Solomon spends his time as a forced laborer. One day while mining, Solomon finds a diamond much larger than any seen before, with a pink tint. Realizing its worth, he steals it and tries to bury it. He is caught in the act by the main antagonist, but is able to get away while burying it safely. Archer finds out about the diamond, and convinces Solomon to bring him to it. The rest of the movie is their immersive, intense story with the diamond and the people they meet along their adventure. My favorite character in the movie was Solomon's son. He is abducted by the rebel group and forced to be a soldier, and kill. The change that he experiences over his time in the militia is astounding, it awes the viewer about how one can change so much in such a short time. This, more than any other aspect of the movie, made the story more worrying and real. All in All, I would heartily recommend this movie to any young adult and older. This movie highlights what happens and can happen in Africa. It is very emotional and thrilling, and does a very good job of connecting the viewer with the movie emotionally. The actors are very convincing and passionate, and it plays like a true story. This movie was one of my favorite movies, and I will likely view it again."

","In the midst of civil unrest in Sierra Leone, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) goes about his daily business as a fisherman. He is a hard working man who does everything he can to provide for his family and he also has a bright son who he hopes will become a doctor one day. Vandy becomes separated from his family when rebels from the R.U.F lead by the evil Captain Poison (David Harewood) capture him and force him to work for them in the search for diamonds. Vandy finds a large diamond and attempts to hide it, but he ends up being caught by Captain Poison. Just as Vandy is about to hand the diamond over, the R.U.F end up being attacked by the army and Poison gets shot and captured which gives Vandy the opportunity to bury the diamond. Vandy also ends up captured as the army also think that he is part of the R.U.F. However, when diamond smuggler Danny Archer (DiCaprio) hears that Vandy has hidden a large diamond (thanks to an outburst by Poison), he bails Vandy out of prison and offers to help Vandy's family in exchange for the diamond.<br/><br/>The first 10 minutes of this film were shocking, but also brilliantly filmed and incredibly realistic. Straight away, I just thought 'Wow'. There are a couple of scenes early on that aren't easy on the eye, but again they are necessary in order for the audience to understand and appreciate the utter savagery of the R.U.F.<br/><br/>One thing I really liked was how rich this film was in character development in particular with our anti hero Danny Archer. We get an entire back story about him being a former mercenary and we learn that his parents died in a pretty horrific way when he was very young. Character development is important in films, but sadly it is something that seems to be overlooked far too often. Solomon Vandy is the likable everyday man who will do anything to protect his family - the 2 later scenes involving Vardy and his son were particularly moving and this was due to a combination of fine acting and good scripting. Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is also on hand to assist our unlikely duo when Archer tells her that he'll give her that 'big story' that she wants in exchange for her assistance in helping Vandy locate his family.<br/><br/>For me, what set this film apart was the plot twist involving DiCaprio's character. I was really pleased that he finally became a good guy and let Vandy keep the diamond and ultimately sacrificed himself. The most touching moment in the film was when Archer rings Bowen and asks her to arrange for Vandy to meet Van De Kaap (the diamond merchant) in London. This whole set up was just so that Vandy could get his family over to England and away from the danger that exists in their home country. I was really quite moved that Archer finally did the right thing which just made me appreciate the film all the more.<br/><br/>I've tried to do this film justice with this review, but I really don't think that it's possible to properly put into words how incredible this film really is. The acting, the script, the direction, cinematography and general atmosphere of the film were all first rate. One thing I can guarantee is that after watching this film you'll definitely pause and think carefully before purchasing that Diamond Ring or Diamond Necklace."

","Blood Diamond transports the viewer into the violent world of precious minerals sold in order to finance conflicts. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a diamond smuggler who is in need of a discovery in order to save his life after a botched smuggle. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a family man who longs to see his son, finds a rare diamond while in a forced labor camp. Their paths cross and they embark on a journey to find the diamond while attempting to fulfill their objectives.<br/><br/>The performances of DiCaprio and Hounsou are full of conviction and really glue the film together. The movies many scenes of dramatic tension rely heavily on the talents of the two actors, and they do not disappoint. DiCaprio delivers a rugged performance, adding substance as he questions his profession while witnessing the many horrors cause by conflict diamonds. This allows for a believable and moving change in a character with likable and unlikable qualities. Hounsou works well with DiCaprio and even steals the show sometimes. Solomon's pain flies off the screen and hits the viewer in the heart. He represents the pain conflict diamonds has caused many Africans. Vandy's life, like many others, has been ruined by the very activity which has made Archer a rich man.<br/><br/>The film works as entertainment, but does it complete its job of raising awareness? Does the film exploit the suffering of the same Africans it hopes to help? These are questions I asked myself after. The film depicts, in brutal fashion, the recruiting of child soldiers and the forced labor used in procuring the minerals. The films intention is to show that people wouldn't buy diamonds if they knew it hurt someone, but Archer says ""the world wants what we (Africa) have, and they want it cheap."" And that is the problem. The world is aware of these atrocities, but corporations continue to deplete Africa of its resources, producing cheap consumer goods while costing many Africans their lives."

","Set against the backdrop of civil war and chaos in 1990s Sierra Leone, ""Blood Diamond"" is the story of Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a South African mercenary, and Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a Mende fisherman. Both men are African, but their histories as different as any can be, until their fates become joined in a common quest to recover a rare pink diamond that can transform their lives. While in prison for smuggling, Archer learns that Solomon - who was taken from his family and forced to work in the diamond fields - has found and hidden the extraordinary rough stone. With the help of Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), an American journalist whose idealism is tempered by a deepening connection with Archer, the two men embark on a trek through rebel territory, a journey that could save Solomon's family and give Archer the second chance he thought he would never have.

","In general I really enjoyed this film, it has an amazing story line and has a positive message to go along with it, its something that is quite common nowadays in terms of film, but it is none the less extremely enjoyable as a film, and you wont be bored at any point throughout the film. <br/><br/>The acing is one of the highlights of this film, with particular praise going to DiCaprio, being a fan anyway definitely swayed my opinion, but his amazing attempt at the South African accent will eave you quoting for days. He really gets into the characters as well, even though this sort of character is a specialty of DiCaprio, it is still enjoyable to see him put the South African tinge on this character.<br/><br/>Hounsou and Connelly are also welcome additions but they did not really shine as actors as much as DiCaprio did. The general cast was also good and really helped to show off this particular part of the world and emphasise the struggle of these people. Being about some real life event this film did not make the fatal mistake of making the film almost a documentary int eh way it is set out, it is instead a story and a good one at that.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's death is something that is essential to the story line and I'm glad they put it in the film as it really keeps the idea of T.I.A, and his death is slightly over emphasised but is not ruined by how it is shown, it instead just lingers on his death for a second and then moves on. The only part of this film that did annoy me was the ending, the idea the at the very people who we knew would no longer associate with DiCaprio's character were willing to work with Hounsou for DiCaprio was slightly outlandish, and a little absurd, but it did make for a good ending tot he film, so that it not just end with DiCaprio's death.<br/><br/>I thought this was a really good film that did not linger on the environment too much and instead focused on the story being told."

","Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"" (2006) takes place in the late 90s during the Sierra Leone Civil War between government soldiers and rebel forces. The title refers to diamonds mined in African war zones and sold to finance conflicts, thereby profiting warlords and diamond companies worldwide. The film depicts many of the atrocities of this war, including the rebels' amputating people's hands to discourage them from voting in upcoming elections (!). Yes, this is shocking, but as the characters say in the movie: TIA. That is, ""This is Africa."" <br/><br/>The story involves Rhodesian Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man with a haunted past who has made himself a key player in the business of conflict diamonds. Amidst the extreme political unrest he meets the beautiful Maddy (Jennifer Connelley), an American journalist who actually cares about what's happening, and Solomon (Djimon Hounsou), an honest African fisherman whose son has been taken by the rebels to be brainwashed and fight for their cause. Archer's sole interest in Solomon is that the fisherman knows were a huge blood diamond is buried, which could be Archer's ticket out of Africa.<br/><br/>I'll be perfectly honest with you, I didn't know anything about this civil war or 'blood diamonds' until seeing ""Blood Diamond,"" so the film is successful just by being educational.<br/><br/>Although the story takes place in Sierra Leone (coastal northwest Africa) the film was shot in Mozambique (coastal southeast Africa) and South Africa. Regardless, the locations and cinematography are excellent, as is the score.<br/><br/>Although the story is only moderately engaging and moving, the acting by the principles is great. We are treated to an interesting moral conundrum with Archer. Will he selfishly steal the blood diamond or keep his word and split the profits with Solomon? Will he continue to justify his part in perpetuating the problem of blood diamonds or will he risk his life by unveiling what he knows so Maddy can get the news out? Dicaprio is notable in the role. But the best character, by far, is the undefiled Solomon; the film successfully makes the viewer cheer for him and his cause.<br/><br/>The film runs 143 minutes.<br/><br/>FINAL WORD: This is a solid political thriller and educational to boot.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"

","Leonardo di Caprio has shown his chops as a leading man, but it's hardly a surprise considering his last few movies. He lends a good level of gravity to a role and its themes, while remaining extremely entertaining and unpretentious. As Blood Diamond shows he tends to work with scripts and directors that enjoy a dollop of popcorn sentiments. It's perhaps no surprise that Martin Scorcese's best modern work was with Leo. <br/><br/>Not that Blood Diamond isn't serious or intense. It packs quite a moral message about war and greed. But the story never wanders too deep into navel-gazing territory and keeps the pacing solid. Djimon Hounsou is fantastic - and the real anchor - as the embattled fisherman trying to save his family, while sadly Jennifer Connelly's journalist character is a tad convenient, but serves a role nonetheless. It's a fairly violent and heavy-handed film, but it never loses sight of what it wants to do - entertainment with a message. And it does that well."

","One of the best war movies I've ever seen! The movie Blood Diamond is set in Sierra Loene in 1999 in the heart of political conflict and civil war, fought between government soldiers and rebel forces. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Danny Archer, an ex-mercenary from South Africa, who meets Soloman Vandy, a Mende fisherman. As they cross paths, they begin their journey in attaining the highly valued pink diamond, and this brings them together as they share moments of friendship and survival.I thought the acting was fantastic throughout the film. The actors were able to represent their characters well and that really helped get the main point across from the movie, which is the issue of blood diamonds. The overall cinematography also stood out because the war and mining scenes were extremely realistic. The music included in the movie played a large part in adding to the intensity of the film. Besides all of these characteristics, I think one of the best things about the movie is the political context it presents and how it makes you think about the issue of blood diamonds and child soldiers over in Sierra Leone. This movie raises awareness of the conflict and possibly will even make people want to do something about it. What makes Blood Diamond stand out from other movies is that the quality of the movie is great, but it also manages to deliver an important message. One major downfall that was noticeable to me, and there weren't many of them, was that the movie can get slightly overwhelming and a bit confusing at times, especially to people that aren't familiar with the conflict and/or with watching war movies. The storyline moves quickly and makes it hard to keep up with what's going on in the film. However, that doesn't distract the viewer enough to make this movie any less entertaining or informational. Blood Diamond, based on a true story, represents the reality of the political issues in Sierra Leone over diamond mining and child soldiers. Many of the war scenes are intense, so this wouldn't be a good pick for children. This movie has a good combination of action-filled war scenes along with dramatic storyline, including the importance of family, career, and romance. I found myself fully engaged throughout the entire movie as I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for what happens next. Blood Diamond kept me fully entertained while also informing me of the real-life issue in Sierra Leone. I would rate this movie 10 out of 10 stars, Blood Diamond is a must see!"

At the beginning of this trip, he is ruthless and sly that he kills the rebels who hinder him and lie to the reporter- Maddy to bring him to other place. However, he changes his mind at last. He knows that he cannot live this place but do a right thing at the end of his life. What a touching film! I have watched it for 3times!

","Blood diamonds are diamonds mined in diamond fields in Africa. They are sold to finance an insurgency, government army's war efforts. At first, Solomon Vandy had found a diamond in the diamond fields and give the government army discovered. With the help of Maddy Bowen, an American journalist whose idealism is tempered by a deepening connection with Archer, the two men embark on a trek through rebel territory, a journey that could save Solomon's family and give Archer the second chance he thought he would never have. Finally, Solomon Vandy and his son have change their life.<br/><br/>After I see this movie, I think that is exciting and meaningful, such as my teacher Dr. Caren, she said that she never buy the diamond again maybe it need to use some life exchange or happen something unfair things to get it. So, I think that is a good movie. And I suggest all people should see one time at least."

","Blood diamonds talked about the story of Archer, an African mercenary smuggler and a fisherman Solomon in Sierra Leone. One day, rebels invade Solomon's village and caught his son Dia. After that, Solomon had separated with his family and worked in a diamond fields. In the diamond field, Solomon found a valuable pink diamond and he hided it in a mountain. Archer knew it when Solomon was arrested by the government army. So Archer tried to approach Solomon and asked Solomon to give him the diamond and Archer promised to help him to find his missing family.<br/><br/>Through the story of Archer, Blood Diamond shows the dark sides and real situation of Africa. It shows the serious problem of children soldier in Africa.

","Blood Diamond starts off with some brutal imagery and never lets up. It combines quantity and quality to get its point across. It wants to put across a strong message to the viewer and then intertwine a story around that. It does all this very well.<br/><br/>The film takes itself very seriously and there is no times for laughs. I can recall chuckling once at a line during the entire film and that was amidst something else pretty shocking happening. We never think to ourselves that we should be due a laugh soon, because the films tone is set early and set clearly.<br/><br/>The story itself is all linked together extremely well and all the elements combine brilliantly.

But in actuality her character is made vital to the end product, due again to the great writing.<br/><br/>A very good film, as we've come to bank on when Leonardo Dicaprios name is on the billing.

","""Througout the history of Africa whenever a substance of value was found locals die in great number and misery.."" ""Blood Diamond"" is best Edward Zwick movie I have seen so far ( I was immensely disappointed with Tom Cruise turd ""Last Samurai"" ) With characters and locations seem straight out of a Wilbur Smith novel Blood Diamond displays an example of blood mayhem , tragedy and huge suffering occurred during Sierra Leone Civil war ( 1999 ) in West Africa. The catch is rich diamond deposits of Sierra Leone of course. Everybody wants them , brutal RUF rebels who raids and burns villages for labor to work in diamond mining , South African mercenaries who sell arms to them in return for the diamonds rebels got , diamond cartel which funds mercenaries and rebels to control the illegal diamond flow to market , individuals , governments you name it. This movie shows how inhuman we can be in pursuit of material monetary enrichment and disregard human suffering in the background. Or worse inflict that suffering ourselves...<br/><br/>Meet Danny Archer , ex-South African soldier now mercenary and diamond smuggler. Leonardo Di Caprio displays this character excellently on screen. He studied this character meticulously , perfected a Rhodesian accent , obviously took some kind of military training down to ammunition saving in battle situation as any sane soldier in combat situation does. This is not an just an action movie ( though there is a lot of amount of action and violence ) This is a drama , history , social commentary movie with realistic action and a little bit romance. When bullets struck home it usually kills or wounds one severely. Archer is a cynic. He is what he is. A man making his own fortune in a place of chaos....Although he is one of the three main characters he is not an angel or do gooder. His actions are usually based on his interests. But in fact he is is a decent man who has the capacity to do right thing. He just does not know or show that...Di Caprio was really brilliant with this character and that year Academy should have awarded him for this performance...( I am not including the Departed of course )<br/><br/>Djiman Hounsou is also very good as other main character as Solomon Vandy a poor fisherman who is separated from his family when RUF rebels raided his village. While working as a slave labor for rebels he finds a huge diamond and hides it. Meanwhile trying to find his family , especially his son Archer finds him and his secret so two make an uneasy deal...This character is usual and even a little bit stereotype for Houmatsu but again he plays it strongly...He is somewhat representative good simple ordinary man , another add in countless victims of Africa's troubles , a man of simple nature who determined to take his family back <br/><br/>And lets not forget Jennifer Connelly as Maddy Bowen an American journalist , idealist trying to make a difference by writing facts...By acting as voice of conscience for Archer she makes an impression though Connelly's character is a little bit weaker than other two. Still Maddy was passionate and quick-witted. Her silent romance with Archer was beautiful and unusual somewhat more classic romance in over sexualized Hollywood...Most of the supporting cast is also very good as David Harewood as sadistic RUF rebel commander ( he was also humorous sometimes ) , Arnold Vosloo as commander of mercenary forces , Kagiso Kuypers , Basil Wallace and Michael Sheen <br/><br/>The battle sequences , violence , tragedy of child soldiers might be haunting but they are also strong reminders of what really happened and shall happen as long as we don't care...When you pay your three month salary to purchase a diamond ring for your fiancée / girlfriend / wife think about it. That piece of shiny rock might have passed through a layer of human blood....<br/><br/>T.I.E. ( This is Africa )"

","Blood Diamond is a surprisingly intense and informative movie that the general public needs to see. Yet, the box office viewing is evidence of what America does to Africa on a general level (turning a blind eye) that it's no surprise it never earned a #1 spot. Still, I believe it to be one of the best movies I've seen this year. Leonardo DiCaprio, similar to his performance in The Departed, is believable, strong, and convincing. The story is strong; the cinematography is excellent; and overall, Blood Diamond does everything I want a movie to do (to educate, captivate, and be enjoyable).<br/><br/>Back in 1997, when Titanic was breaking all kinds of box office records and creating a few of its own, Leonardo DiCaprio suddenly started being touted in some circles as ""the new Gable"". That's not precisely accurate--even though Titanic was in many ways this generation's Gone With The Wind, Clark Gable's best characterizations (GWTW, San Fransisco, The Misfits) were mixtures of darkness and light while DiCaprio's Jack Dawson was nothing BUT light. Fast forward to nearly a decade later and who'd have anticipated DiCaprio as the new Bogart? Forget his British accent: Blood Diamond in some ways is Casablanca all over again, with the big honkin' precious stone that he and Djimon Hounsou form an uneasy partnership over filling in for the letters of transit. DiCaprio has grown and toughened more in a shorter period of time than any other contemporary actor that comes to mind: as recently as 2002's Gangs of New York he wore the cynicism and amorality demanded of him like an ill-fitting mask; now, with this and The Departed, it's come to fit him like a glove. Leading lady Jennifer Connelly does extremely well here too: after what seems like years of playing glum women carrying the world on their shoulders (which she excels at, as A Beautiful Mind and House of Sand and Fog clearly prove) it's a joy to see her smile, laugh and do repartee with equal skill! The movie itself is a smooth, handsomely made and entertaining action film with an ambitious social agenda: it not only wants to, like Hotel Rwanda, open Western eyes and hearts to the bloody atrocities Africans commit upon one another in Hatfield/ McCoy-like tribal skirmishes, but influence our pocketbooks by getting us NOT to buy jewelry sold by those who profit from and promulgate said conflicts. (The central--and perhaps unintended--question brought up in movies like this, which has reemerged anew with Saddam's execution, is so unanswerable it almost qualifies as a Buddhist koan; namely, if colonialist or dictatorial rule keeps the lid on decades and centuries of tribal resentments which would explode in endless bloodbaths if removed, is it possible that maybe iron-fist rule isn't ENTIRELY a bad thing?) Director Ed Zwick, who specializes in thoughtful historical epics and contemporary thrillers wrapped around such thinking-person's heartthrobs as Dicaprio, Denzel Washington, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, works slickly and seamlessly but intelligently, avoiding many of the standard mistakes (such as having DiCaprio and Hjonsou be buddies); his directorial trademark seems to be the use of one piece of explicit gore to represent an entire canvas of violence--remember the soldier's head being blown off in Glory or the theatergoer's arm doing the same in The Siege? My central difficulty with Blood Diamond lies in Hjonsou's characterization (NOT his performance, which is typically powerful). He seems to have two and only two dramatic functions: to reclaim his son from the rebel army that has kidnapped, enslaved and brainwashed the youth, turning him and other children into something not far removed from George A. Romero's zombies, and to turn DiCaprio's cynical opportunist into a better person. This is the Noble Negro syndrome, most famously exhibited by runaway slave Jim in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and cafe piano player Sam in Casablanca; both are honorable creations, but have been duplicated too many times to serve as much more than an all-too convenient and arbitrary literary device, no matter how well played...and anyway, Hjonsou is certainly a nuanced enough actor (as In America demonstrates) to warrant and deserve characters with a few more layers and complexities. This does a lot to explain why Z wick's strengths and limitations as a filmmaker parallel those of his more famously socially conscious predecessor Stanley Kramer, and why Blood Diamond, as watchable as it is, is ultimately too schematic to be anything more than a good night of movie escapism, which is precisely what I'm sure Zwick DOESN'T want it to be...and why it's not causing QVC jewelry hostesses Jane Treacy and Lisa Robertson to lose any sleep over inability to meet their sales quotas."

","When I heard that the main character was Leonardo DiCaprio I was doubtful because how can an American actor play the role of a white African Rhodesian! But he did it fantastic. I admire Meryl Streep for her talent of getting accents right but Leonardo proved that he is at the same level. Being married to a Rhodesian I know this accent and he was spot on. It is not a South African accent as there is a difference, like between an American and a Canadian accent. If he had an American accent, it would have killed the movie. He was taught by a Rhodesian farmer and whom even taught him to double tap the rifle instead of Hollywood like firing automatic, wasting ammunition in a place where you won't get replies. Well done and noticed by the people who have been in war situations in Africa.<br/><br/>The movie was terrific and showed how violent conflicts can be in Africa. All actors were great in their role, including all the extras that most people forget. The children, the rebels, the army. It shows the tragedy of greed and how, without control over resources, it ends up in a wild west scene. The same thing is happening now in Zimbabwe where diamonds have been discovered."

","This colorful but violent drama has a basic plot of a frantic search for a large, pink diamond by a smuggler, a peaceful villager and assorted mercenary types during Sierra Leone's civil war. Leonardo di Caprio and Djimon Hounsou form an uneasy partnership in their hunt for the precious stone and struggle to keep one step ahead of pursuing rebel troops and soldiers of fortune. Journalist Jennifer Connelly plays up to di Caprio hoping to get an exclusive story about the true horrors of the diamond trade in war-torn African countries. Connelly wants to expose a complicated pipeline of diamond smuggling and laundering that finances the rebel troops and prolongs the horrors and suffering of citizens of Sierra Leone. Another plot angle is the seizure and brainwashing of Hounsou's young son by the rebels. The boy is trained to kill without hesitation or conscience, as are scores of young African boys against government soldiers. Di Caprio and Hounsou are very good, while Connelly seems to be the conscience of this picture which leaves a bittersweet taste."

","Warning! May contain spoilers!<br/><br/>Overview:<br/><br/>Blood Diamond is an over the top violent action-thriller film. It is set against the civil war in Sierra Leone. It describes how the diamond smugglers based in countries like South Africa, Zimbabwe etc to name a few take advantage of the situation in Sierra Leone and sell the diamonds off to European countries at a huge margin. A part of the money they earn is used to fuel more tensions between the rival ethnic groups in the country. One American journalist (Jennifer Connelly) together with a young diamond smuggler (Leonardo Di Caprio) and a local Mende tribesman (Djimon Hounsou) set out together with different objectives. They end up helping each other in their needs and ultimately cracking down on the illegal diamond business.<br/><br/>Was it any good?:<br/><br/>Blood Diamond is an awesome movie! Flawless direction backed by an outstanding screenplay and acting and an excellent background score, Blood Diamond won't let you settle down for a minute. I liked the way how every part of the smuggling racket was documented in the movie. Leonardo Di Caprio delivered an Oscar worthy performance. It's about time he grab an award at the Oscars. Jennifer Connelly did a fine job as a journalist too. Film's music is really worth checking out. It added the necessary emotions to this bloody thriller.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>Set aside 2 ½ hours of your life, free your mind and enjoy this vintage thriller."

","""Blood Diamond"" takes place in Sierra Leone and tells the story of an unlikely alliance between a smuggler (DiCaprio) and a fisherman (Hounsou), the latter of whom hid a valuable diamond during his forced stint in the rebel controlled diamond mines. Each has a different plan for the diamond: One wants to make his fortune and escape while the other is bent on being reunited with his family.<br/><br/>The cast is a fine one with multiple Oscar nominees Leonardo DiCaprio & Djimon Hounsou leading the way while Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly's also along for the ride. Personally I'm not much of a fan of Connelly but DiCaprio & Hounsou are eminently reliable. That being said, I'm not sure if I completely buy DiCaprio as a South African but that's subject to debate.<br/><br/>The storyline is pretty exhilarating stuff though it does have a somewhat manufactured, Hollywood-ized feel. If you expect a realistic exploration of the diamond-fueled conflict in Sierra Leone then I would advise you to look elsewhere since this film is more action-oriented. That, of course, isn't necessarily a bad thing but the semi-strained credulity doesn't exactly work in favour of the film's more serious points.<br/><br/>The direction by Edward Zwick is well executed and captures the action admirably. The visuals are attractive though not particularly remarkable. I can't recall any specifics about the score but since it was by seven time Oscar nominee James Newton Howard that suggests that it was unobtrusive rather than mediocre.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the stars of this film or if you're looking for a thriller that balances action & drama then this film ought to entertain you.

","Solomon Vandy (Djimon Honsou) is a local fisherman in 1990s Sierra-Leone, whose son Dia Vandy (Kagiso Kuypers) has been captured by the RUF. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a Rhodesian diamond smuggler coming slowly to terms with the corruptive nature of his enterprise. Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is a maverick American journalist striving to expose the war's atrocities and dodging no punches in doing so. Their lives thrown together by the traumas of the nation, they embark on a harrowing odyssey that takes them from one side of the spectrum to the other, from the war's most rudimentary horrors to the corporate diamond dealers working behind the curtains, Bowen in search of the mother-lode story, Archer in search of the mother-lode diamond, and Vandy in search of his son, whom the rebels have turned into a soldier.<br/><br/>The film dives headfirst into the horrors of the conflict, but does so responsibly, without ever losing its sense of direction. The plot, while bordering on convolution, makes adequate use of all its characters, and manages to address nearly all of the war's most prominent attributes without feeling forced or unnatural.<br/><br/>On a visceral level, the film fares especially well. The battle scenes are superbly shot, the use of color is amazing, and the machine gun fire is so encompassing that it went on rattling in my head a full three hours after I walked out of the theater. Hollywood, in its anti-war persuasion, has a long-standing tradition of removing all the glamour and virtue from the battlefield, but the one thing it hasn't transplanted, at least not measurably, is war itself. The class of conflict we see in Blood Diamond  far from the battlefield, far from the domain of soldiers and trained professionals, and far, even, from the needs and ideals of the people in its shadow  is, for the most part, uncharted territory. In their chaos, brutality, and total lack of redemption, Zwick's battle sequences show us just how low civil conflict can sink, to a greater extent than any other movie I can think of. The scenes depicting the child soldiers and their mental conditioning are of a piece all their own, and can't be praised enough.<br/><br/>Yet for all its merits, there's still something rotten at the heart of the movie, and it has something to do with the dynamic between Archer and Vandy, Archer dominant, Vandy subservient. It's Archer who leads the operation, Archer who makes all the crucial decisions, Archer who saves the day whenever the going gets tough, and Vandy who wanders dutifully behind, distinguishing himself only by his way of his blunders.<br/><br/>And that's just the beginning.<br/><br/>At one point, the two pilgrims express their bewilderment at the savagery and frequency of African conflicts. It's a perfect opportunity to pose questions about the ongoing effects of European colonialism, but Zwick chooses instead to leave the question unanswered, and even goes a little in the opposite direction, suggesting that the African psychology might be inherently violent.<br/><br/>But it's not the implied racism of these details that bothers me so much as their distraction from what the movie should inherently be about  the Sierra Leonians and their struggle for survival. It's their future at stake. Their nation. Their diamonds. Their war. As such, it should be their story that we're focusing on, but instead, we get the story of an outsider, and experience the war from his point-of-view. Danny Archer is, beyond doubt, an interesting figure, and so is Maddy Bowen, if somewhat woodenly portrayed. We definitely want them in the movie, but we want them in supporting roles, not prancing about in the foreground. The core of the story should be Vandy's search for his son, not Archer's search for redemption. Maybe then the film would do a better job of emulating the resilience and fortitude of the African people, and not just the horror and bloodshed that is all too often a feature of their lives."

","An amoral adventurer in search of a fabulous treasure is a common theme in film, but Blood Diamond isn't interested in mindless fun, instead attempting to create a truer version of that Hollywood fantasy set in a world of horrible brutality.<br/><br/>The result can be upsetting and hard to watch, as gun-toting rebels or soldiers mow down people indiscriminately. Even in a scene where 30 people die, the movie does a good job of making you feel each death, showing you individual humans desperately trying to escape rather than the standard extras falling down of so many movies.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond does not take a simplistic view of the violence. The blame is placed on both rich diamond merchants and on the Africans themselves, but more than that the blame is on people who simply accept the situation, represented in the movie by the phrase ""This is Africa"" to consign the madness to the status quo.<br/><br/>But the movie also says something can be done, and while the main do-gooder is a rather clichéd role - an idealistic American journalist trying to expose corruption and save the world - the message that there is hope keeps Blood Diamond from being too depressing.<br/><br/>In spite of a fairly uncompromising portrayal of violence and a strong political viewpoint, this is still very much a Hollywood movie, with big name stars and personalities far less complex than the situation they find themselves in. I could see people objecting to this, but I think it works, both because it gives the viewer something to hold onto in a sea of madness and because it fits in nicely with the movie as a through-the-looking-glass version of old Hollywood treasure-adventure films.<br/><br/>I avoid really depressing movies, and I don't know if I read what I just wrote before seeing Blood Diamond if I could have brought myself to watch it, but it is well worth watching, a powerful, moving experience. Hopefully it did some good in terms of bringing these problems to light."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","0","14 June 2008"," Talent-loaded ""Blood Diamond"" is not only insightful, but entertaining
","While the reason ""Blood Diamond"" feels like a thrill ride is indeed because of the persistent anarchy and chaos during the Sierra Leone civil war, you can't help but admit this film is downright entertaining. But that's not to say this film is not without a sensitive, humanitarian side, because the truth is it does both very well. <br/><br/>Acclaimed producer/director Edward Zwick (""The Last Samurai"" (2003), ""Glory"" (1989)) has a knack for finding historically significant (but not overdone) stories and turning them into entertaining films without diluting the meaningful content. Any film that can do both well deserves higher praise than one that does only one of them well. Zwick has done that with ""Blood Diamond,"" this time painting a picture of war-torn Africa and its corruption from the diamond industry.<br/><br/>The film's true protagonist is Solomon Vandy, played by Djimon Honsou, who is absolutely sensational in his role as a fisherman who is separated from his family by rebel forces in Sierra Leone. While what you've seen about this film in its publicity would lead you to believe Leonardo DiCaprio is the leading man, this is not his story--in fact I would go as far as to criticize those in charge of promoting it that way. We should not be so arrogant as to identify the white, American actors as the main characters in this story. Not to take away from DiCaprio, who really proves his versatility as one of the world's best actors in this film playing a greedy, South African diamond smuggler named Danny Archer. His character is likable but corrupt and it makes him very interesting.<br/><br/>Zwick does a tremendous job opening our eyes to the true nature of the violence in Africa, showing us how kids are turned into heartless killers and how human life there seems to have no value--it's all about who has the most weapons. Jennifer Connelly's role as a journalist trying to make a difference simply feels like a way for writer Charles Leavitt to explain and question that nature of the corruption in the diamond industry, but toss that aside and you have a strong, interesting character nevertheless because Connelly gives that without fail in everything she does.<br/><br/>The film keeps a strong pace while still taking the time to show the historical context and Zwick deserves a lot of that credit though Leavitt should get his due. His script never lags or feels unnatural and he takes his characters on a variety of emotional tears. The way the action weaves itself in does feel a little forced, but it's entertaining and keeps you on edge.<br/><br/>""Blood Diamond"" is full of talent. From Zwick to Honsou and DiCaprio and to the incredible editing team that keeps everything in the destructive, semi-automatic gunfire action sequences from getting out of control. As far as great films go, this falls into the category of excellent action films. Not every film is going to be deeply moving, but for the amount of action that fills up the running time of this film, it's particularly eye-opening and meaningful."

And do you know about the real facts of diamond? Maybe there are not so many people who know about it. If we know those real facts, we can't say ""I want diamond"" anymore. Because, the diamond you are going to buy is ""Blood diamond"". This movie will help us to face up to these real facts. Finally, is this movie heart-warming or heart-breaking movie? I think it's up to you. What I really want to say is I'm sure this movie will change your world!"

","After years of watching his films, I have finally discovered that Edward Zwick is one of my all-time favorite directors - and a talented writer and producer as well. Check out his resume and be blown away: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001880/<br/><br/>In Blood Diamond, Zwick takes a very talented primary cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connolly) and puts them through the meat-grinder of post-colonial African politics, smuggling and murderous revolution. While simultaneously giving us the redemption story Zwick has previously done so well (Last Samurai, Good Will Hunting, etc), cultural study and a bit of tastefully done romance. <br/><br/>DiCaprio plays a tragically nihilistic diamond smuggler; Hounsou plays someone who might, under other circumstances, have been one of his victims; and Connolly plays a liberal American reporter whose ex boyfriends refer to her as a crisis junkie. All three get caught up in a bloody and senseless revolution against an equally corrupt government- Both sides support an exploitive diamond-smuggling trade. <br/><br/>Hounsou, dragged away from his family during a rebel raid, finds a diamond of rare quality and size while working as a slave to the revolution. DiCaprio needs the stone to pay back a debt and get out of Africa, and Connolly wants to tell the story. <br/><br/>The film blends action, strong emotion, and a sense of place with a rare sensitivity. It ranks among Zwick's several great films, but did not sustain my interest quite as well as some of his work. Visually lovely, painfully well-acted, and never exploitative of an easily and often-exploited subject matter, Blood Diamond is a great example of excellent mainstream Hollywood film-making. <br/><br/>Highly recommended. A+"

","It's a Hollywood movie, so don't expect it to be some independent acting tour de force. Yeah the acting is slightly wooden, but it's not really the actors or director's fault that movies are made base on a statistical model. The clichés soon vanish because the movie is exciting, beautifully shot and brilliantly edited. The subject matter is so jarring that any stereotype quickly gets mowed down by children from hell. I forgive pedestrian writing in the cause of bringing to light the plight of Africans. I forgive Jennifer's stodgy lines because I am captivated by her eyebrows. If a movie draws me in and keeps me up past my bedtime, it has entertained me 80%. I don't recall a movie bringing to light the recruitment and training of children as well as this one, or that immerses the viewer in the expanse of Africa like this one, so the culture shock is enough to make me forget about the dialog."

","""In America it's BLING BLING, but in Africa, it's BLING BANG."" <br/><br/>Blood Diamond is a must-watch, not just because Leonardo DiCaprio is incredibly hot in it, but also because it sends a very important message to its spectators. It tells us that behind the glamorous sparkles of a diamond lies a violent past. Millions of people in Africa are being slaughtered for just a small piece of the said crystal. How would you feel if three heads were chopped off for that small piece of diamond you're wearing right now? This movie explains it all. The best part is, it's not just for pure entertainment. It's a wake up call for all of us.<br/><br/>A village in Africa was just razed by rebels and the villagers hands were cut off. Fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), saves his arms from the axe and agrees to work for the rebels in searching for rare diamonds. He therefore finds a large piece in a pond, and hoping that it's high value can save his abducted family, Solomon keeps it for himself, buried it in a land hidden from the eyes of the rebels. Reinforcements arrived, and he was taken into a locality where he meets Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a smuggler of diamonds with an expertise in mercenary tactics. The fisherman then enters a bargain with the smuggler: Solomon's family in exchange for the pink, large diamond he discovered. Danny's side of the deal was fulfilled with the help of American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) and much to Solomon's dismay, his eldest son, Dia, was taken in by the rebels. Solomon and Danny then embarks on a journey on one of Africa's hilly regions in search for the missing kid and the much-wanted stone.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou is the cream of the crop, with Leonardo coming in second. The two makes a powerful pair, and even though it looks like a total cliché (millions of bullets are fired towards them, yet they still won't get hit), their exceptional acting skills covers up the flimsy action sequences. And by the way, this is the only film of DiCaprio's where I find him stupendously sexy (even though he's laden with scruffy facial hairs in his role as Danny Archer). I was disappointed with Jennifer Connelly's lackluster performance in this film, not to mention that I had always looked up at her after seeing her previous films like 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'A Beautiful Mind.'<br/><br/>The sounds carry the tension in this film. The script is a killer. And Edward Zwick did a great job with his camera after effectively capturing the natural beauty of the African region (with the help of the exceptional cinematography care of Eduardo Serra). The violent/gory content is insurmountable by any action film I've seen, vestiges of racism are unavoidable, and the audiences taste for diamonds can possibly be lessened after witnessing such tragic events.<br/><br/>BLOOD DIAMOND is an incontestable masterpiece. It's not just for the action, it doesn't just fill us with information, but it also makes us realize how wrong it is for us to patronize these rare crystals (pardon me for reiterating). Just see it for yourself, and you'll understand what I'm talking about."

The first ending is the Dramatic Hollywood, when people wanted to live drama for the shake of it, because drama intensified dreaming and people where a little more romantic than today. The second ending is the Family Hollywood, where the only thing of value in this wealthy world is family, its bonds, endurance and continuance. The third ending is Politically Correct Hollywood, where ""a few good (wo)men"" stand up against evil corporations, and not only do they win their personal fight, but they change permanently they way business is done.

This movie is savage, explicit, violent and so damn well made. It's back at the turn of the millennium 1999 when war ravaged on in Sierra Leone. Amdist it all, a fisherman is kidnapped and taken to toil and find diamonds. He finds one hell of a diamond and hides it. After he is put into jail following an attack he gets out. We basically follow the fisherman, Davey Archer (Dicaprio pulling out yet another brilliant performance) and a female journalist trying to find the hidden diamond amidst an awful war. Powerful images abound this film. Kids carrying machine guns and killing people to the tune of gangsta rap. Bodies strewn around the war ravaged streets yet beautiful poignant images as well none more poignant than the last image of Davey Archer dying in the sunshine. At peace. Please watch this film.

","Fascinating history does not always make exciting compelling film but in the case of ""Blood Diamond"" it does. This is good news in the sense that the movie delivers big time on all levels: fantastic action, intense emotional drama, and provocative political excitement. It is bad news in the sense that viewers can become so caught up in the sheer entertainment qualities of this amazing movie that we forget the brutal truth behind the story.<br/><br/>That the people of Sierra Leone throughout the 1990s were enslaved, raped, mutilated, and driven out of their homeland all for the sake of placing diamonds on the hands of the rich and to finance military chaos in one of the most naturally beautiful places in the world is something we should never forget. Having noted that particular point, it's impossible to deny that both Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou fully earned and deserved their respective Oscar nominations for ""Blood Diamond."" The overall script takes on a great deal of social and moral responsibility. <br/><br/>In addition to its exposure of the atrocities that have left Sierra Leone a permanently scarred country, ""Blood Diamond"" also illustrates just how deeply intertwined are the history and the future of Blacks and Whites on the continent of Africa. In a way, the same may be said of the history and future of the relationship between Africa and the world.<br/><br/>by Aberjhani, author of ""Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance (Facts on File Library of American History)"

","A completely exhilarating experience. It's a wild ride in a foreign land that grabs you in it's opening sequence and never let's go. The story is simple. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a man living in 1999 war-torn Sierra Leone trying to make an honest living and raise his son to be a doctor when rebels invade his village and force him to work in the mines trying to discover diamonds for the illegal diamond trade with companies across the globe. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a smuggler who has lived his entire life in Africa and makes his living by taking the diamonds out of Sierra Leone and bringing them to the people that can get them out for retail sale. Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is an American journalist doing a story about Leone and its civil war over the blood diamonds.<br/><br/>Through a series of events, coincidence and propositions Solomon finds a large diamond, hides it and agrees to show Danny where it is with the promise of being reunited with his family. In order to get to his family, Danny needs to provide Maddy with information regarding the conflict diamonds and who is involved in trading them. So all three of them embark on the same journey with very different motivations. Solomon wants nothing more than to be reunited with his family. Danny wants to get the diamond so that he can make enough money to finally get out of Africa. And Maddy wants her story and to do whatever she can to help the innocent people of this war-torn country. What follows is an extraordinary adventure that contains a beautiful exploration of African culture, an in-depth study of the lives of those affected by conflict diamonds and some of the most exciting action sequences of all time.<br/><br/>Though the film may appear to be too preachy at times, I think it avoided the more-traveled route of chastising America for two hours and instead presented the real situation of what happened (and is still happening) in areas of the world at war over conflict diamonds while providing a high level of quality entertainment. It never rants about America's misdeeds but presents the well-known fact that if people weren't buying these diamonds, there wouldn't be any war over them. It never slaps American wrists but it constantly flows with a purposeful cause and a riveting story. DiCaprio and Hounsou give two of the most impressive performances of the year (particularly the former) and switch seamlessly from wildly intense rage to biting cynicism to heartfelt sincerity. DiCaprio really manages to shine however with even more contrast displayed in his roller coaster quick romance with Jennifer Connelly's Bowen, a seductive and highly intelligent product of a journalist's background. There is also a subplot involving child soldiers that is just as informative as it is haunting and terribly unnerving."
"horlicksng","9","0","0","1 January 2008"," A wonderful movie... simply superb
","I am a newbie for movie reviews section in IMDb and this is my very first review that I am going to write.<br/><br/>A year ago, this movie was recommended by one of my relatives noting it as ""a must see movie"". At that time I missed out the opportunity to watch it in theaters and thereafter I just forgot about it. Recently, I came up with a chance in the library to borrow the DVD version of Blood Diamond. I was stunned and amazed by the movie.<br/><br/>The story was reflecting wars and chaos in Africa and how they connect with the luxurious diamonds that only wealthy people could possibly gain access to in the big and developed countries. The film started by introducing you to a normal fisherman family with Soloman Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) as a father and his son Dia. The tragedy started when Soloman was captured by the RUF (the opposing groups in the area) and separated with his family. He came to the realization that the RUF are helping organizations in search for diamonds which they could sell and buy their own necessities and weapons. At the same time, Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCarpio) was an ex-army men and currently a soldier-of-fortune and smuggler of diamonds. He desperately wanted an out from Africa. By coincidence they met and joined together for different goals. Danny for the diamond that Solomon accidentally discovered, and Solomon for Danny's connections to seek his own family. Along the way they met different people such as reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly)and encountered different events. This is a movie full of adventures, actions and catchy dialogs. However this isn't simply an action-packed movie with no substance.<br/><br/>It really did a good job in capturing audience's attentions into the whole issue and the situations in Africa. In the story, the RUF captured Dia and made him a child soldier. You can feel your heart aching when you see really young children holding up guns killing others. The movie did not explicitly discuss this issue but the message was already delivered strongly to the audience. It gives you more thinking into the international relations in the world around us. In addition, it very much aroused our awareness towards the value of buying and keeping luxurious products. Really need to give credits to the director for making such a fine piece.<br/><br/>About the cast, they had a really solid performance. I haven't watched much of DiCarpio's movies and my knowledge about him was somewhat limited to the handsome boy in ""Titanic"". His performance as a ragged mercenary, Danny Archer, was simply wonderful. His acting completely altered my view of him as just a ""pretty boy"". Personally his performance was even better than that in ""The Departed"". I was quite sad in seeing his tragic ending and the words ""TIA"" kept ringing in my brain when I was watching it. Soloman, Maddy and Dia were crucial in the whole film and I think they did a very good job in delivering the characters across.<br/><br/>Good plot, great cast, nice entertainment and meaningful message carried across. What more can you ask for?"

","This is an amazing film. It is testimony to the power of film to bring a true story to life. DeCaprio was surprising and I think surpassed anything he has done before by portraying such a complex character, a credible character. The story is an amazing one and if you are someone who has never been interested in the politics of Africa and the US and the diamond exploitation by westerners, watch and see if you can still be apathetic. My husband and I watched this together and found it mesmerizing. Even though DeCaprio was better than we've ever seen him before, we think that Djimon Housoun should win an Oscar. (i.e. if the award people are giving them out yet for truly fine acting and no other reason.) The one scene he had with his son was so extremely powerful, it will, I think stay in your mind and heart forever. It was a tour de force, just done so well, it is impossible to see and not be moved. I read that Housoun has talked about how simplistic Americans are in our understanding of Africa and I think he is correct. But he did something in this film that I think will bring anyone, including Americans, who see it into the 21st Century. Who can watch that scene and not feel the power of love, the courage of a father reaching for a lost and emotionally crippled son. I hope we see a lot more of Djimon Housoun. This man is a wonderful actor."

Okay, I can hear you say, it is just a movie. Right, it's not a documentary; what happened here didn't really happen. But we see it in the news everyday. Things like this happen. It may be diamonds, it may be oil, it may be gold or it may even be wood. We know it happens, and we unwillingly take part in it. And we get numb. I looked at news footage like this so much, it sometimes changed my perspective. The other day, the news showed a clip of so called freedom fighters, ripping of the clothes of a young woman, throwing her down, in the street, naked. She fell on her knees, and there the clip halted. And my first thought was, she looks nice, immediately followed by the thought, she must have hurt herself. And after that, only then I thought, she may not be alive in a couple of seconds. What kind of world is this, to make thoughts put in this order? This movie shows it all. Of course it's a movie, so it has to be entertaining too, but it puts your nose in the muck all the way. Leonardo DiCaprio is a good actor, it shows. He had a hard time to find his way up again, but he did. Djimon Hounsou, Kagiso Kuypers and Benu Mabhena play very credibly a family that gets ripped apart in this war.

I suppose that because Di Caprio was a fundamentally amoral character like Cat Shannon in the Dogs of War, he could not but come to a tragic end despite the fact that deep down we were all secretly rooting for them.

One of Edward Zwicks previous flicks, 'Courage Under Fire' , starring my personal fave, Denzel Washington, also happens to be one of my fave movies. But this one was definitely more powerful. The beauty of the Sierra Leone landscape has been interspersed seamlessly with the gore that has become commonplace in that country, and probably in that continent. Like they say..TIA..'This is Africa'.. The opening sequence of the RUF rebels coming and laying waste the village to which Soloman Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) belongs, sets the tone for the rest of the movie, which manages to spread the message of the illegal diamond trading that cost locals their lives, while at the same time, keeping you at the edge of your seats as a slick action thriller.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio..for the first time (yes, not even in the Departed), looks like a tough guy. though i never had any doubts about his acting chops, his baby face made me skeptical about him in these kind of roles. But, boy did he carry it off well. I still feel like sayin to everyone. 'Ma man'..in the Rhodesian accent he portrays in the movie. This movie should finally, at least for me, lay to rest his Titanic image. Before i saw the movie, i was wondering if they gave him the Oscar nomination for the wrong movie(i was expecting him to get it for the Departed)..but this is definitely a more worthy performance.<br/><br/>The other stars in the cast also give stellar performances. Djimon Hounsou is perfectly believable as the tough yet simple village fisherman, who just wants his family back. Jennifer Connelly, apart from looking ravishing, seems to be perfectly cast..<br/><br/>The movie has a number of poignant sequences..when Leonardo's Danny Archer finally breaks down and says 'Sometimes i wonder if God would ever forgive us for what we've done.. But then i realise, God left this place a long time ago..' Or the scene when Archer is leaving and Connelly gives him, just a glance..but a glance which conveyed a lifetime of longing..Archer's response?

"jeremy-liebster-1","8","0","0","23 July 2007"," Far exceeded expectations
","I watched this film with very low expectations - mainly because it was a big budget Hollywood film about Africa. I therefore naturally expected it, like The Constant Gardener, to be full of subtle-as-a-sledgehammer clichés inspired by trendy, Bono-lite politics rather than harsh reality. I was therefore taken by surprise to see an intelligent, gritty, well-acted film which though tragic never becomes mawkish and does not attempt to trivialise Africa's problems by blaming them on an easy target. The brutish violence on show is undoubtedly necessary, albeit unsettling especially given the age of many of the perpetrators and victims. Leonardo di Caprio gives an accomplished performance in the lead role and is certainly believable as an Afrikaans smuggler. His is a heroic and sympathetic, if uncomfortable character who in his own bitter way lays waste to some of the West's cosy ideas about Africa. His unrequited relationship with the female journalist meanwhile is quietly poignant and never overly-sentimental. The cinematography and direction is glorious and the scenes of Africa absolutely beautiful. Blood Diamond isn't perfect - it deals better, perhaps, with the issue of child soldiers than diamonds, and it would have been more effective had it ended on the African cliffs rather than in an auditorium in London, but these are minor gripes.

","BLOOD DIAMOND was a movie that could have touched the hearts of anyone who watched it, and it was slightly educational. It made us aware that something like this was happening. It was also a violent movie physically and verbally, if you catch my drift.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was one of the best movies I've seen in a while, and I would love to see more like this. It put us in the shoes.. or feet of the people in Sierra Leone and let us see how it is like to have your hands cut off even just for hiding the smallest piece of diamond imaginable. The blood diamond business is cruel.<br/><br/>Also not to forget the child Dia Vandy and Solomon Vandy. Solomon is struggling to find Dia and once he does, it's not a pretty sight.<br/><br/>I thought this was a great movie and I look forward into seeing it again. If the Blood Diamond trade is still going on.. I hope that it ends and no one will ever have to experience something as horrible as that again."

","I truly had low expectations for this movie. When I saw the commercials for this, it looked like another action dud. It had good press and had garnered a couple of nods from the Academy, but I just could not get past the advertising. So, my friend loans me the DVD the other day, and to my surprise I really liked it. The performances are very strong by all three main characters. The action is not overwhelming, and well executed. I see two primary flaws in this film. First, it is a little melodramatic. The weight of the subject matter is enough. The constant fist clenching, screaming at the sky seemed forced. Second, I feel the movie should have ended ten minutes earlier. Far to often studios feel the need to punctuate movies with a tidy conclusion. Sometimes a film is well served by a little ambiguity. Despite it's flaws, this a very good film. Not just the sum of it's action sequences."

","My expectations were more than fulfilled with a great story that opened my eyes wider. Leonardo Di Caprio proofed again that he is one of the best actors on earth. He has still very much potential left to deliver other interesting performances. I liked very much his role and how clever he played it likely in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. I have also great respect for Djimon Hounsou because he acted the father-son relation in a very touching way till the end. The soundtrack from composer James Newton Howard was as usual wonderful. I was very surprised that an important part of the world's diamonds are coming from such violent and bloody places in Africa and I am very happy that all the stuff did have this courage to open our eyes. All is very well packed in a clear message to the responsible authorities and also to all smokers. What I didn't like therefore is it was 30 minutes too long but anyway, there were enough fast paced scenes with lot of action that compensate this overlong thriller. Rating: 7/10. If you liked this one you shouldn't miss TEARS FOR THE SUN, HOTEL RWANDA or THE CONSTANT GARDENER."
"nycritic","9","0","0","2 June 2007"," A Retrospective
","Personal, political, and exploitation/commercial interests clash in this straightforward adventure film, Ed Zwick's aptly titled BLOOD DIAMOND. While this title might be misleading, making unsuspecting viewers believe this is closer to a Indiana Jones' type adventure complete with human sacrifices, the entire scope of the plot revolves around a rare blood diamond -- a stone of a pinkish color used to finance terrorist organizations, hence the 'blood' portion of its moniker -- that has immeasurable value. And sure enough, sacrifices of a very human sort abound left and right, most notably in Solomon Vandy's plight to retrieve his son who in a mêlée has been kidnapped by a militant group and used as a child soldier, and the only person he can trust is the very untrustworthy Rhodesian merchant Danny Archer who wants the stone as his ticket out of Africa and will help Solomon find his missing family... for a price.<br/><br/>BLOOD DIAMOND can be summed up as an adventure movie that has a powerful, symbolic message at its core -- that of the trials and tribulations that the African people have had to endure in the name of profit and greed. Djimon Hounsou tackles a clichéd role with an immense believability -- it's very moving, even gripping, to see what he has to go through to get something as simple as his family -- and especially his now child soldier of a son -- back. When he cries out that he cannot live without his family, knowing he was supposed to have protected them and failed, you believe it, and you root for him and hope that Archer does not betray this absolute trust Solomon has placed in Archer's hands. You want to see the moment when he becomes reunited with his son and gets back at the man who took him away in the name of this cursed stone.<br/><br/>Leonardo diCaprio has a tricky role to play, being frankly amoral in the Bogart tradition. He looks even more rugged than he did in THE DEPARTED which helps him bring forth credibility into his portrayal of Danny Archer. Jennifer Connelly, always an actress I love to see in the small roles she undertakes, makes a lot more out of a role that could have been very throwaway. She has a great scene where she uses her wiles and her ability as a photographer to get the two men out of a very risky situation, and a rather moving scene towards the end, but the film has little use for her, being focused on the terse relation between Archer and Solomon.<br/><br/>BLOOD DIAMOND is terribly old-fashioned, alas. It's not a bad thing: sometimes a movie benefits by going back in time and exploring the values that were prevalent then. Because of an existing conflict involving these blood diamonds, the events of the late Nineties served as a platform for the story being told here. If it weren't for the crystal-clear cinematography, it wouldn't be odd to see Bogart, or Grant, for example, in the role of Danny Archer, and/or Ingrid Bergman or Deborah Kerr or even Barbara Stanwyck in the supporting role of Maddy Bowen which Connelly plays. But, not to digress, old-fashioned or not, this is a fine adventure with a strong humanity at its center."

","Disclaimer: This is not an autobiography of yours truly. This is the review of a great movie  blood diamond. Details, facts, information are a strict no-no in this review, so if you were looking for the standard monotony of all that, try elsewhere! First of all, I would like to push this article back to my childhood days please. All right thanks! English class - I was taught one tongue twister. I didn't realize the value of it then, nor did I say it right when I tried to say it fast. Today I know what I was taught in four simple words  good blood, bad blood.<br/><br/>Then I learnt science in class  the arteries bring the blood from various parts of the human body to the heart for purifying.<br/><br/>I tried relating my lessons to this movie and this is what I came up with: THE BLOOD-LINE The veins bring the blood to the heart and to the rest of the body.<br/><br/>Danny Archer (Leo di Caprio) was one such vein, smuggling and supplying the diamonds mined by the slaves to the prospective buyers (obviously white men).<br/><br/>The blood in this context is the diamonds which are mined and dug by the slaves in Africa. They pay with their lives if they try to escape a stone; they are worse off anyway by finding one.<br/><br/>One such enslaved family is that of Solomon Vandy (played by Djimon Hounsou). For those who are bad at history like me (and for all those nerds out there making quizzes and stuff), look up the history of Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>Solomon is forced to work in the diamond fields while his son is being taken by the ""terrorists"", or typically the bad guys who teach the kids to smoke marijuana and kill relentlessly and mercilessly without reason. Now Solomon finds a diamond stone big enough to make a person choke (but honestly I thought it looked rather small), and everyone is after it.<br/><br/>How Danny goes after it by making a deal with Solomon to redeem his family and life in exchange for the diamond forms the rest of the movie. Along the way, they meet Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connely), a reporter who is rather nosy and manages to fall in between the danger and the love that both she and Danny never had in their lives.<br/><br/>I don't know how emotionally or otherwise Danny and the reporter got linked, but even while waging the war of words, they fall in love. Leo di Caprio seems to do what he does best  save die a martyr in all his movies  Titanic, The Departed and Blood Diamond. That seems to be a pattern with Leo movies, but we still love it  makes him dearer to us, doesn't it? One quote worth remembering from the film is where Danny meets the reporter in the island; I forgot it anyway but Leo puts across the truth of how the white women wanting the diamond rings for their weddings are the reason for the blood diamonds.<br/><br/>TO ADD MORE VEIN TO THIS REVIEW Man's obsession for metal has always been against nature; just as man himself has been and will continue to be. Science couldn't figure out the stark predation for these shiny little things. The whole thing has only advanced so much that he can kill another of his kith and kin for obtaining the silly stone and proceed to find his happiness.<br/><br/>This movie is just about that  how man goes against his own brotherhood to proclaim what he calls  happiness, which in reality is foolhardiness to follow one's eyes and not the heart or mind.<br/><br/>Along the course of this voyage there are people who pass on the stone across the bridge, under the table and what lies beneath is just grit, grime and dirty blood.<br/><br/>Good blooded ones were slaved by the bad blooded ones, asked to mined (mind?) their own business. And in this case, anything to do with blood has to do with matters of the heart, literally! This movie also gives way to a fact of life  that the heart purifies bad blood into good blood  just as Danny Archer found out at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Well, I definitely didn't get any wiser with my tongue-twister, but I most certainly managed to spin a yarn with it enough to end this review thus: I have always been a rebel in my family  I didn't know why humans were longing after a shiny piece of metal. I did not know what joy it gave them, but after watching this movie, I know this  one man's blood is another man's diamond (or gold or any metal for that matter!!). I know de Beers or any jeweler would be after my ""blood"" after reading this review, but remember that in the end, Good Blood always prevails!"
"ExpendableMan","7","0","0","26 April 2007"," Politically charged action thriller
","*Note: This review contains a SPOILER. Not a very big one, hell not even worth ticking the spoiler warning box when typing it up. But if you want to go in completely blind I suggest skipping to the next one. Unless that has spoilers too.* <br/><br/>Overly preachy epics about the nonchalance of the Capitalist West when it comes to the suffering of the third world have been getting something of a resurgence of late. First, we got George Clooney pointing an accusing finger at the global oil industry for the radicalised violence of the Middle East in Syriana and just before Christmas, Forrest Whitaker came charging out of the starting gates in The Last King Of Scotland to show exactly what sort of people are supported by Western Governments in order to keep the rich/poor imbalance in place around the world. Next to join this rapidly growing club is Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond. The target this time round though is not corrupt oil barons or African dictators but the diamond industry and their fuelling of third world conflicts by buying up diamonds from combat zone warlords. For those of you worried about another talk-heavy slow burner though then we may have found a solution, for while Blood Dimaond may be so preachy that it's borderline propaganda, it's also an action movie.<br/><br/>Yes, Zwick and co have decided to use the civil war that ravaged Sierra Leone in the late 90s as a backdrop for an adrenaline charged gun flick that is reminiscent of John Woo's Bullet In The Head for putting a civilian face on war rather than a military one. The film follows Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a South African mercenary who recruits down on his luck native Solomon Vandy (Djimon Honsou) to help him find a king size diamond out in the bush while the country falls apart around them. This deranged little quest soon turns into an epic journey with them battling from one set piece to another. Thus, we get the pair ducking and diving around street corners as they try to escape the country's capital during the rebel invasion, the city torn apart as gunfire rips into soldiers and civilians alike with reckless abandon. Later, we get a brutal massacre of a group of journalists leading to a fast paced car chase and also helicopter attacks on guerrilla camps. As the duo hurtle in and out of life and death scenarios, you find yourself wondering exactly how much violence an Oscar nominated 'serious' film can possibly contain? Right up until another truckload of soldiers come bellowing out of the jungle with guns blazing...<br/><br/>Mixed up in all this is a variety of subplots showing the plight of the country. Solomon's decision to join Archer is fired not by greed but by the desire to find his missing son, who has been captured by the rebels and turned into a child soldier. This provides the most harrowing element of the film, with youngsters barely past their tenth year being brainwashed into killing machines who slaughter their own people without any sign of remorse. It's lifted right from the pages of National Geographic magazine and is all the more haunting for it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, not everything works as well as it should. The running time especially is pushing it, clocking in just shy of three hours which could have been trimmed down by jettisoning the unnecessary ending, a hasty epilogue tacked on when it would have worked far better to end on the mountainside. Whatsmore, Jennifer Connelly's journalist Maddy Bowen is a bit too heavy handed. She works as mouthpiece for the writers opinions and not a lot more, associating love struck men who buy diamond rings for their childhood sweethearts with mass murderers with all the tact and grace of an appropriate metaphor with a tact bypass and no grace.<br/><br/>Preachy though it may be though, Blood Diamond is still an enjoyable film and a noble one at that. Like Syriana beforehand, it illustrates how everything in the world is connected and how something as innocuous as going to the shops can lead to hundreds of people in another country being slaughtered by AK totting eleven year olds. It's a very slick, dramatic movie and has another impressive performance from DiCaprio. It might be over the top but when most films would turn a blind eye to the world, this one shoves it right in your face and will leave you with at least a few difficult questions to consider."

","Blood Diamond describes the civil war in Sierra Leone and the principles under which this war was fought. The images and plot make it easy to understand the insecurity lived every day in this country during those times and the fear with which any resident of the country lived with. The movie also portrays the illegal exportation of diamonds as the force that was running this massacre, with rebel groups running the diamond mines and all the different problems that this brought upon their nation.<br/><br/>Many images on the movie are shocking, especially the images of children being brainwashed and converted into killing machines, performing atrocious acts. These images effectively show the impact that this war will have on the future of a country like Sierra Leone and the pain that its citizens felt during these terrible times. The character development is extremely good, with an Oscar-deserving performance by Leonardo DiCaprio and great acting by Djimon Hounsou. The movie also shows great African scenery as well as a good script which makes the movie highly intense from beginning to end. I highly recommend this movie, especially because of the fact that the story is based on a real-life, relatively recent event. Viewers will be highly instructed on the history of this war in Sierra Leone and the atrocities that were lived by its people."

","Set in a war torn Africa the story follows an apparently emotionless mercenary turned diamond smuggler. The imagery used to portray the violence and heartlessness that is the way of life in these war torn countries should be enough to leave the audience in a severe state of shock. Nominated for best picture and several other Oscars and awards including ones for acting which surprisingly went to Leo DiCaprio when Djimon Honssou portrayed the true acting skills. The stunning contrast between the violence and deprivation of the war torn country of Sierra Leon and the majestic beauty that is the true essence of the African continent, create the perfect setting and ideas that the audience should see. Despite the clichéd but seemingly necessary romance the film was surprisingly ""unidealistic"", which is uncharacteristic of Hollywood, however the director (Edward Zwick) would seem to be making a name for himself with the tragedy that runs rampant in his films. Over all it should get a three and a half to four star rating, Leo's accent, amongst those of real South Africans turned out to be shabby and slightly false, however the Americans viewing the film probably won't know the difference."
"fwomp","10","0","0","28 March 2007"," DiCaprio Has Earned His Chops
","Not being a very big Leonardo DiCaprio fan in the past, this year I've had a growing amount of respect for this young man as he proves his acting chops again and again. First it was within the excellent Scorsese film THE DEPARTED, and now he does another great job in BLOOD DIAMOND.<br/><br/>For some reason, this film stands out above The Departed for me. Where the Departed had an ensemble cast, Blood Diamond can make no such claim (although there is a sprinkling of well-knowns). Many African actors lend their previously hidden talents to the film, giving it a bit more authenticity than The Departed. Most notably among them is the buffed Djimon Hounsou (AMISTAD), a quiet man living in a quiet village that is torn apart by rebel fighters trying for a piece of the region's diamond trade. Djimon plays the smart and tough Solomon as he races to find his family and his son. After being imprisoned via slave labor by the rebels, Solomon finds a huge, rare, pink diamond and quickly buries it. Having been seen with the diamond, the rebel leader tries to hunt him down.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio, THE DEPARTED), a young opportunist from South Africa, is completely immersed in the illegal diamond trade. He runs into Maddy (Jennifer Connelly, DARK WATER), an attractive journalist from The States who infuses Danny with a sense of morality. Uncomfortable around Maddy, yet still attracted to her physically and emotionally, Danny sets out to find if the rumor he's been hearing about the large, pink diamond are true. He meets up with Solomon and the two form a tenuous bond; Danny wants the diamond so that he can escape Africa and thus his past, while Solomon sees it as a way to possibly save his missing son who's been captured and brainwashed by the rebels.<br/><br/>As Maddy's views of right and wrong spin Danny on his head, and Solomon's race to find his son sparks memories of his father, Danny's not only in for a physical battle, but one that'll force him to deal with his own immoral and prejudicial history.<br/><br/>Part nonfiction, part fiction, Blood Diamond forces the viewer to realize that the rocks they wear on their fingers may have come at a very bloody cost. The movie spares nothing to get its message across; there are children being dismembered, children carrying guns and spraying bullets onto innocent villagers, torture, explosive governmental flaws, and it's all surrounded by one terrible little stone: the diamond.<br/><br/>A very compelling film with DiCaprio dominating the screen (and rightfully so). His South African accent was spot-on and his internal battles of right and wrong are pulled off effortlessly.<br/><br/>This one's a must."

","Lately there have been a lot of movies coming out that I would consider a sub-category of drama. I would name this sub-category either human interest or cause acknowledgment/awareness. The title Blood Diamond gives away the subject matter, which a lot of movie titles have been straying away from.<br/><br/>Film doesn't necessarily have to be a form of entertainment. These specialized dramas are almost documentary-like, but when you throw in a Leonardo Dicaprio all the sudden a movie transforms from awareness to blockbuster. It's a very ingenious way to promote a cause. What I like about the movie is it goes back to the basic element of movie-making: it actually tells a story.<br/><br/>I've never been to Africa, but I was able to empathize with the characters. I have a sense of family, and I hoped Solomon would be able to enjoy his family's company again. His confrontation with his son who was turned brain-washed soldier was very emotional for me. The character of Solomon was acted perfectly. You saw a range of emotions during the film which were portrayed physically. His lips quivered and he didn't say a word when he was angry; he had to hold back his thoughts,feelings, opinions, angers. His reaction when he faced the leader of the R.U.F. <br/><br/>It goes back to a simple statement repeated several times in the movie: T.I.A. (This is Africa). This is what people will do either by force or by will in Africa under the circumstances. Same could be said anywhere: This is Iraq, This is America - this is how we do things here (good or bad; like it or not - and it's almost expected).<br/><br/>The story crosses subject matters though because you can replace blood diamonds with oil, or another material as they mention in the beginning. What has this world become? What is one person or many people willing to do for money? If it means getting out of your situation would you do it too?"

I understand good girl falls for bad boy however a character flaw. I agree the realities of the situation at that time were horrible and vivid. Hotel Rwanda and Proof of life came to mind.Djimon Hounsou was focused and explosive. There were times I wanted his character to expedite and become more cooperative although this adds to the complexity of the character.DiCaprio is becoming increasingly intense with every role lately.

A journalist (Jennifer Connelly) is new to the area yet manages to nail him to the wall for his ambiguity and selfishness. However, she wants a story about the diamonds-for-guns policy that is out of control and she senses he can give her what she needs.

How will the lives of these three players intersect? This is a topnotch film but, it is definitely not for the faint of heart. No, even I did not make it to the end of the film, for the violence is prevalent and devastatingly real, as the movie is based on actual events. On the other hand, the acting is amazing and the African setting exotic and lovely, when the fighting pauses from time to time. Therefore, if you are drawn to films of armed conflict or films that tell the heartbreaking truth, even if it means sitting through scenes of violent inhumanity, this is a movie to consider. It has a very important story to tell and tells it well. Just make certain you can handle its virulent content and, as an added note, do prohibit anyone under 18 from being part of a showing. It has an abundance of haunting images that are hard to shake off with ease."

","Edward Zwick delivers the goods with BLOOD DIAMOND, a tense and very compelling film about the greed and bloodshed that surround the diamond industry of Sierra Leone. Though a bit too long at two and a half hours the story is not only a dramatically viable one for a film, but it also has much to say about human interaction and the sanctity of friendship.<br/><br/>Solomon Bo (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman who becomes indentured to the evil men who search for diamonds after being separated form his family and in the course of working for the vile men who are in the illegal diamond industry he discovers a huge pink diamond and hides it form the overseers. He is caught, jailed, and while imprisoned he is observed by a Rhodesian white man Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who discovers Solomon's secret and arranges for him to be released from prison with money to salvage his life. However, we discover that Danny is in the black market end of the diamond trade and Danny promises Solomon he will get his family back for him if Solomon shares the hidden pink diamond. A journalist Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) finds Danny and recognizes a good resource for a revealing article about the diamond trade. Danny and Maddy form an alliance: the rest of the film consists of the chases to recover the diamond with Danny and Solomon bonding and attempting to avoid every manner of interloper.<br/><br/>The performances by DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly are superb but there are also fine performances in the smaller roles filled with such actors as Michael Sheen, Kagiso Kuypers, Benu Mabhena, Jimi Mistry, and Stephen Collins. The cinematography by Eduardo Serra manages to capture the beauty of the country as well as the horror of the battles. But in the end it is Zwick (The Last Samurai, Courage Under Fire, Legends of the Fall, Leaving Normal, Glory, etc) who transforms the screenplay by Charles Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell into an intelligent and engrossing film. Recommended. Grady Harp"

","Do you notice any blood on your diamond ring when you look at it Madam? No? Then go to see this movie and you'll notice it next time. The most remarkably good features of this movie are the reality of today's Africa and the amazing rhythm of the cut and the images with no dead moments. Particularly remarkable are the constant contrast of the appalling African sequences with the meetings and forums in the comfortable atmosphere of the First World where some dressy gentlemen discuss the problems of the diamond trade in a distant and unaffected way while a lot of bloodshed occurs because of it. This movie shows us a truth that can no longer be ignored after viewing it. In parallel with the struggle for the command of the diamond trade our attention is also drawn to the problem of the children soldiers in which the little children are changed into little killing monsters after being violently abducted from their families and subjected to a terrible brainwashing. The romantic and idealistic story which is the backbone of the movie, joining a white smuggler and a poor African fisherman has got a few flaws perhaps for excess of idealism but it arrives of moving us in the end. Maybe human nature is not so bad indeed after all. Those two characters are looking with different aims for a most invaluable diamond the fisherman has hidden underground. The smuggler wants the money it will give him while the fisherman wants only to be helped in finding his son that a rebel army has kidnapped to make him a child soldier. There is also the sentimental relationship between the smuggler and the woman journalist which occurs in an almost chaste and restrained atmosphere though we can feel its real deepness in some dialogues and even in some silences for instance when the woman caresses the smuggler's hand after he has told her how his parents were killed in Zimbabwe; we can feel his contained emotion after he finishes his story. This is one of the most moving scenes of the movie. But I need hardly say that in this movie nobody goes to bed with nobody. The fact is that we don't even see a single kiss which is rare in movies nowadays. And it looks like the most violent sequences which are numerous and admirably filmed are done without resorting to any special effects or computer tricks which makes them to appear extremely real."

Though Djimon Honsou is probably as good, it's Leonardo who carries the film with a portrayal that should forever dispel any notions that he is merely a 'star'. I didn't see Forest Whitaker in ""The Last King of Scotland"" but of those performances I did see, I can't believe Leonardo didn't win Best Actor for this picture, though the picture itself is somewhat hard to swallow in places. Still the subject matter is so foreign to us that it has to be given high marks for making it all so much more accessible.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly once again somehow satisfies my male eyes and ears almost as if I were defenseless against her. I'm beginning to think I am. And the film moves along at a good clip with little or no pauses to wallow in.

Being from South Africa, we thought this movie would make us look like a bunch of savages, but instead we get a movie that shows just how far one guy would go to save his family and his home. And that theme made the movie for me universally applicable, because no matter where you are in the world a man always set his family's safety before his own.<br/><br/>What made Blood Diamond even more excellent is that the plot of the film is more character bases that action based. It relies on it's characters to tell the story and not the action, as in so many action movies coming out of Hollywood these days. What would killing of women and children be without human compassion, which we find in Jennifer Connelly. Leonardo gives a performance that is not only memorable but also applicable to everyone who sat down to watch this movie. And his use of the one Afrikaans word was hilarious.<br/><br/>All in all Blood Diamond is a spectacular movie that does not offend the person watching but rather leaves him/her with a feeling of gratitude for what they have in their lives."
"jpschapira","8","0","0","10 March 2007"," Character Strength
","I've never been over this but there's what's powerful and will never be other thing, without mattering how much violence it shows; and there's what's powerful because we're obliged to think it is and because violence simply never stops. In the first category we find ""Hotel Rwanda"", a film that didn't need visual violence to get to the viewer; in the second category, Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"" is a perfect fit.<br/><br/>It is undoubtedly a strong film, but it is supposed to be because of the amount of violence in it. Like in ""Hotel Rwanda"", the rebel army of a location (Sierra Leone here) is killing everyone, so Zwick and his team go over the streets and generate a frightening environment with explosions, brutal killings and of course gun shots everywhere. However, the strength within ""Blood Diamond"" doesn't come from its images, or at least that's what I think.<br/><br/>It doesn't come from its story either. C. Gaby Mitchell and Charles Leavitt came up with the story for the movie; then Leavitt, writer of a very good film called ""K-Pax"", worked on the screenplay. There's a problem today with films that try to deal with recent issues: most of the time they don't get it right. I didn't like ""Children of men"" because I think it lost its way; I liked ""The Constant Gardener"" even when I thought it didn't have its problematic all that clear. ""Blood Diamond"" tries to be interesting in terms of its story; Zwick tries, but he doesn't get there.<br/><br/>In Leavitt's tale about conflict diamonds and illegal smugglers, anyone could say that they don't understand the issue completely (even when they try) but that they find the story really interesting and entertaining, which is true. We want to be a part of the issue and be interested about it and we are in part, when we get lost in the jungle with Zwick's flawless technical team, with a lot of experts in action and war films. A very special mention to James Newton Howard's touching score, with the kids singing and the strings reaching to the heart. The man should've won an Oscar by now.<br/><br/>But then again, ""Blood Diamond"" is not a war film when there's a lot of war in it. I would dare to say it isn't even an action film because people is always escaping from the action. So where does its strength come from? The answer is from the characters and their personal story, which is really close to a dramatic event. And that's Leavitt and Zwick's greatest achievement; telling that story with compassion and shooting it with care.<br/><br/>The story is about Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), an African man who, like many others, has lost his family. He hides a big and soft and rare diamond in the mines; Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a smuggler, wants it, so he contacts Solomon and promises him to get his family back in exchange of the diamond. He will do this with the help of Maddy (Jennifer Connelly), a journalist who needs Danny's smuggling facts to write a story that will bring the real issue of the film (the market of conflict diamonds) to light.<br/><br/>It's amazing how Djimon Hounsou always seems to be playing the same role but gets a different approach every time and amazes again. His emotional range here is admirable and it's not clear to me that he's been nominated for an Academy Award two times when he probably should have been nominated for ""Gladiator"" and won; but that was Benicio Del Toro's year.<br/><br/>It's true: DiCaprio isn't perfect here. It's also true that he was nominated for the wrong movie (just watch him in ""The Departed"") this year. His time will come, but we can't deny his South African accent is great and that he delivers a performance that goes all the way, playing a cold man we shouldn't empathize with, but we do. Most of the times we like the main character, whether he is good or bad. Here, the fact that we like Danny Archer is more because of DiCaprio than because of the story.<br/><br/>What Jennifer Conelly does is very brave. She has been choosing the right roles since ""A Beautiful Mind"" and here she goes right into the jungle and her merit is that she appears to be just another normal human being. She's beautiful and you don't even notice her. She tries to bring the part of the issue to life and we care even when, as I said, we don't totally get it. But ""Blood Diamond"" is a very good film, better than ""The Constant Gardener"" and way better than ""Children of Men"". If you don't relate with the issue, you will find the characters interesting. Watch it; you won't regret it."
"pal-o-lo","8","0","0","4 March 2007"," Surelly the best acting performance of Di Caprio so far.
","Well, I went to the cinema, hoping for a reasonably good movie. Lets face it Di Caprio, in the past, never really was more than a pretty boy face and a lousy actor.<br/><br/>But in the later years his acting has been steadily increasing in quality. He seems to have really grown up, as an actor. I mean, with The Aviator he proved once and for all, that not only can he act, but he has become a darned good actor.<br/><br/>In Blood Diamonds, he does one of the best performances by any actor in recent years. The way he managed to balance total cynicism with just the amount of humanity for the viewers not to despise his character, was awe inspiring. In my opinion he should have gotten an Oscar for this film. Not to diminish Hansou's performance, but Di Caprio really shone. And as Hansou got a really well deserved Oscar, I feel that Di Caprio did just as good a performance, maybe better.<br/><br/>Jennifer also did a splendid job. Here is maybe the only weak point on the script. I felt she was maybe a bit underused. Had she been given a chance in the script, i got the distinct feeling that she would have done just as well as her male co actors. But what she did, was a piece of flawless acting.<br/><br/>All in all, I will give this movie a strong eight. I will stop at that, because it lacked the bit of emotional weight that would have given it a ten. Nevertheless, i think this is going to be one of the better movies in 2007.<br/><br/>Run to the Theatre and watch it! You will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>Thats all folks"

","For starters, I can freely say that this is one of the best movies of 2006.

The subject of the movies isn't that amazing but Edward Zwick (the director), with the help of some great locations, excellent script, extraordinary filming and good supporting actors, managed to surprise even the meanest movie critics.<br/><br/>I saw ""Blood Diamond"" with my girlfriend at that time being, and, at the ending she started crying.

","A thoroughly entertaining film. Subjects such as conflict stones are a rarely discussed issue as it is far from the day-to-day lives of most of us. Politically based films such as these have a huge burden to deliver a morale teaching. This film definitely delivers. DiCaprio's character (Danny Archer) is believable and you find yourself liking and disliking him at the same time. DiCaprio really shows that he has matured as an actor and can rise to any challenge. Even his South African accent is flawless. Djimon Hounsou's character aptly named 'Solomon' Vandy is powerful and in the midst of what is almost an action film does give you reason to feel choked and even well up at occasion. This film has a lot of heart! A must watch."
"knightsbridge","10","0","0","28 February 2007"," exceptional film in all its aspects, and Mr. Dicaprio is on his way to become a Hollywood legend...
","This film forced me to write this comment. After seeing it twice i felt compelled to tell other people how great it is.The film takes you in an African experience without one second of boredom, which is fair enough as the movie approaches 3 hours, from the first scene till the end credits you are sitting tight in your seat waiting for the next event in the journey. so lets take a look at the people/reasons behind this success. first, Mr. Leavit's screenplay is nothing less than amazing, he managed to mix the truth about whats going on in Africa (hopeless for many people, maybe including myself) with a little bit of hope. i don't wanna add any spoilers but all i can say is that the story is nice, coherent, and very touching. second, Mr. Dicaprio, wow what a role, the man is going to be a legend believe me, and if it wasn't for the competition being very very tough this year, he'd have walked away with the Oscar, he plays a very good ''Danny Archer'' and he's overall look regardless of his acting actually fits in as a dutch who was born in Africa, his accent is nice, and he gave the role a the real blend and depth it required to stick in your mind for a long time. third, Mr. Hounsou; his role as ""solo"" here approaches his role in Amistad, which was excellent, when you see him in this movie you have no choice except to believe that he's living in ""Sierra Leone"" and that he is really afraid for his family and not acting, i really liked the way he portrayed the character. Lets talk about the rest, Jennifer Connelly is a good as the reporter who cares, but you know whats the problem with her, she's too beautiful that you'll concentrate on how beautiful she is every time she's in front of the camera (is it just me or she's getting more beautiful every movie), over all the casting was very well made and perfect people were given the roles. Mr. Zwick did a good job directing things, the movie is a hard job and as it contains lots of extras and battle scenes that require lots of effort, but Zwick did it and the movie came out the way it did, nothing can be done more than what had been already done. the editing as well as the sound editing were good, you can't find something that is not in place or hear what you didn't suppose to, these are gun shots and these are the African forests, as previously said everything in order. Finally i have to say that the art direction of the battlefields was very precise and the scenes came out very tense. oh, i can't not to mention the music in the movie, that was one hell of OST and hats off to the composer. hopefully the DVD will come out soon because i'm first in the line. Good luck everyone and be fine."

","A solid entry to the 'trials of post-colonial Africa' sub-genre, Blood Diamond is a bit like a lavish Chinese takeaway. It feels very good and is quite moving when you're watching it, the acting from DiCaprio and Hounsou is strong stuff and, as ever, Connelly is radiantly beautiful, but ten minutes after the film I feltnot much. Maybe it is just less affecting than Last King of Scotland, or, as someone without a diamond in the house, maybe the guilt trip it lays was less pressing than the unilateral Western shame of Hotel Rwanda. Either way, I think this is a solid and enjoyable movie, but less potent than the director and all-star cast were perhaps hoping for."

In a word, WAR! Leonardo DiCaprio is a former soldier turned mercenary who, with his own African blood makes a deal to help find the fisherman's family in exchange for a share of the diamond's value. With an American journalist helping his cause and all kinds of war lords, private armies and thugs in pursuit, 'Blood Diamond' has a cruelty free message about what is harvested from the earth and the responsibility people have for making humane choices. Explosive action, greed, compassion, determination and very adult entertainment all have a place in this blistering movie that you can't take your eyes off."

","Despite some loose ends, such as the questionable murderous rage of Djimon's character (and what it may mean to his perception of himself in the end), there is a really significant message in this movie. It can serve a real cause. Many viewers will be made aware of realities they do not imagine, and may well then want to remember, about the Good and the Bad in human Nature. There are many questions asked throughout the film about Man being a Wolf to Man, and not all get answers, intelligently enough. Djimon Hounsou is a powerful presence on the screen, and we may regret that some aspects of his character do not get time to develop, and particularly his figuring out his own violence. There may be some indications of what he really is in short sequences such as the penultimate sequence in the airfield. However, that was unsatisfying to me. This film had to be made, and it was very well done."

Leonardo Di Caprio (archer) is a white south African who is involved in diamond smuggling and seems to be indifferent to the hell going around in Serra Leon and further agitated by countries making benefit from this fatal illegitimate trade. he comes to Serra Leon to finish a deal but is unfortunately caught and in prison he hears of Vandi (Hounsou) who has got a big rose priceless diamond.<br/><br/>archer decides to convince Vandi to guide him to the place where he has buried his diamond in return for reuniting him with his family after being shattered because of the civil war between the government and the rebels. this is the story in brief but there is much more in the movie to be noticed.<br/><br/>firstly, we know that smuggled diamond is part of the legal diamond trade and that the united states controls two thirds of this trade. traders are keen on keeping the civil war in Serra Leon going on to hold a firmer grip on the diamond resources in the torn country on one hand, and out of fear of the rebels who will pour large amounts of diamond into the world markets-if they ruled the country- thus lowering its price and causing companies unimaginable losses, on the other. wars are, therefore, military activities guided by economic motives in the first place. there is a very important sentence in the movie that sums up the sufferings of this African nation ""thousands of people are paying their lives for diamonds they've never had"".<br/><br/>the movie talks about another very important issue which is recruiting children. children are brainwashed,after being kidnapped,and instructed to be obedient slaves. they are robbed of their innocence and trained to commit the most evil vices. there are 200,000 children soldiers in Africa.<br/><br/>archer and Vandi set off in journey to find the rose diamond together with Jennifer Connelly the journalist who spent a large part of her life in different war zones trying to search for justice.<br/><br/>in this journey we come to know a lot about each of the three. archer's parents were ruthlessly killed in the civil war where his mother was raped and his father was beheaded, may be this is the main cause of his feverish desire to collect the hugest possible amount of money and leave the whole continent for good.<br/><br/>Connelly is seeking documents and evidence that prove the involvement of major companies in the smuggling of blood diamond. she manages to get documented information from archer about the blood diamond trade that will help her reveal the truth to the whole world.<br/><br/>archer has a closer look at the sufferings of civilians through the tragedy of Vandi's family- his wife and daughters at the refugee camp (and he meets them in a very touching scene)and his son kidnapped by the rebels. Vandi is ready to sacrifice anything for the sake of being reunited with his family, he is the total opposite of archer. so this interaction has left its impact on each of them.<br/><br/>in a very short scene archer is walking in Serra Leon with prostitutes gathered around him and one of them saying ""no HIV"", this is also an important point because large numbers of women, especially in Africa, have fallen into the clutches of slavery and aids out of poverty. they are the most vulnerable to be infected with sex-transferred diseases.<br/><br/>there some questions that came into my mind after the movie concerning archer's character, did he give Connelly the required information just to get her help to reach the diamond? could he have given the diamond to Vandi if he wasn't shot? in brief, was he really changed at the end of the movie ? Leo and Hounsou were both excellent, Connelly made the best out of her role. the violence scenes were very real, though i don't know to what extent computer graphics has intervened.<br/><br/>the part following the mountain scene at the end served as an anticlimax to the story yet i liked the scene in which Vandi goes to testify about the bitterness of the internal strife in his country. he comes to be the voice of the weak,fragile, oppressed part of the world to which no one listens or cares to know about. he goes into the room with the African music in his ears emphasizing his high sense of belonging."

Since his role in 'Amistad', Hounsou has been considered as an actor in a class of his own, while DiCaprio has turned in his best and most mature performance to date and deserves all the praise and accolades he receives.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond opens the eyes of all those who go about their daily lives unaware and unaffected by the transgressions that take place against humanity and forces realisation as to the true cost of a life of luxury.<br/><br/>Zwick, with the aid of an incredible backdrop, impressive cinematography and two commanding performances, has created a powerful masterpiece that tugs at the soul."

The acting is led by Leo's strong performance and although he is not in my top ten actors by any stretch of the imagination i think he is going to get better and better in much the same way Brad Pitt has. The plot itself is served up in a series of chapters and i assume this is to retain some link to the book it was based on (?). I did like this format but think that the real quality in the film comes from the abhorrant and misguided violence of the rebel forces. A strong focus is on the people of the conflict, and the innocent role the civilians played. Whilst a complex political arena highlights the mechanism behind the civil war, it is obvious to see parallels to current world conflicts. The timing of this movie lends itself to further comment on the economic motives for any war and once these wars have begun, who keeps them going."

Edward Zwick is a great director, he directed The Last Samurai which I loved, so why didn't I want to see this movie? That's a question I keep asking myself, but finally I ended up going(cause I was forced too) and I loved every minute of it, I couldn't believe how amazing Leonardo DiCaprio's acting was, it was probably his best work ever and definitely Oscar worthy, same goes with Djimon Hounsou's acting, freaking amazing. Jennifer Connelly was so-so.<br/><br/>This movie even had a lot more action then I'd expected, it was action packed but also was very violent and very bloody, kids with guns isn't a pretty site to behold. The movie is a little long, over 2 hours, but the director did a good job at keeping the pace. The music was great, the action was awesome, the acting was amazing. The story was OK, it was interesting to see that every character had there own reasons to do what they wanted to do, ex: Solomon wants his family, Danny wants a diamond and Maddy wants a story.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with Solomon and his child Dia going to school and back, but when they come back they see there little village being massacred and destroyed by rebels. Solomon tells his child to run, Solomon takes a machete and cuts a hole threw the back of his (straw) house and get's his wife and other child out, but a rebel see's him and several rebels chases Solomon then put him down on the ground, Solomon tells his family to run. The rebels make a speech and then cut some kids arm off, then there ready to do the same to Solomon, but the rebel leader decides to spare him and take him as a prisoner and use him as a worker, then the movie continues on from there.<br/><br/>The movie feels pretty realistic, lot's of blood flying everywhere etc...

When we are all old and gray and praising the legendary actors of the industry DiCaprio will be a name among greats like Pacino and Nicholson mark my words.<br/><br/>Though as I spend all that time talking about Leo I shouldn't leave out Djimon Hounsou's performance either which is very emotional and touching as well in this movie.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this yet, I really suggest you should. It's definitely worth the time. Just remember this isn't a ""war movie"" this is a movie that brings to life some of the horrors in Africa."
"oneloveall","8","0","0","24 January 2007"," Important and accessible edutainment
","This wonderfully made dramatic adventure manages to be both a powerful, solid Hollywood process and an inspirational, compassionate piece of proactive film-making at the same time, a feat one must not take for granted. Especially for the nearly two and a half hour running time, Blood Diamond remained exciting and engaging throughout, anchored by a sensitively developed moral curve, rendering the picture far more resonant than the action-induced frenzy much of it seems to be. Much of these battle intensive scenes, recreating the civil war hell taking place throughout this movie's well-pieced plot dealing with diamond smuggling in 1999 Sierra Leone, does become somewhat repetitious and overwhelmed in brutal violence, but to it's credit never becomes overtly sensational, instead continually presenting a horribly realistic backdrop of the downward hell much of a country torn apart by strife turns to. <br/><br/>In the spirit of this compassionate work, Charles Leavitt's unpretentious script services the plight of these characters quite admirably, directed by seasoned vet Edward Zwick without the strain of artistic clout that usually prevents great work from becoming greater. The result is a movie experience as thrillingly entertaining as it is universally and profoundly engaging, no easy feat in our Hollywood markets; hats off to Zwick, Dicaprio and the rest who knew they were contributing to this important statement. <br/><br/>The hot topic debate of Dicaprio's authenticity with his South African accent seems to me a bitter point to argue about. This is certainly one of the best roles he has been in for some time, surpassing even the tense performance he delivered in his other critical darling The Departed. What his accent may miss in getting every subtle intonation correct, he makes up with in a fiery, naturalistic turn that is helping restore my faith in his abilities as it once was when he was young. I felt that, more then butchering any sort of accent, if Dicaprio was guilty of anything it was inflicting too many generic mannerisms at the end of sentences and the like, a small complaint in an admirable and invigorating turn. For it's brilliant synthesis of entertainment, education and inspiration, it is easy to look past any faults Blood Diamond may harbor in it's earnest grip around your heart, making this the most sincere blockbuster of 2006."

","About the trade in diamonds in Sierra leone during the civil war there, which made me go to google and find out more. But the actual plot is very well executed so that it is a very exciting film about which group will be able to recover a precious pink diamond first. The film it also raises questions about what makes us think of someone as ""good"" or ""bad"" and the answer is much less trite or superficial than i would have expected. The dialogue is noticeably better than in many American films, very true to life and sometimes sharp and funny. Loved the soundtrack as well, although wouldn't recommend the film to people sensitive to noise/gunshots. Some advance criticism has said that it's just a Hollywood movie tackling a serious issue, but that is surely better than a comedy movie about horrible drunken bigots (Borat) and strangely far less depressing. I think they have done an excellent job of making the audience think about the kind of thing that in a magazine you would try to turn the page on, without being preachy or despondent. Also Leonardo di Caprio should get the Oscar - although i know he's up against Forest Whitaker, difficult. The kind of film that makes me wish i was still young enough to take crazy risks and do something better than sitting at my bank desk looking up movies on the net that I've just seen! But hey, I'm still younger than the character in the movie...let's go to Africa."
"Sheila88","10","0","0","24 January 2007"," Worth your money - but don't compare it to 'The Constant Gardener'
","Because they are very different stories, and very different styles. The Constant Gardener was an artistic, touching personal story about love and loss. Yes it did cover the same general themes of African's being used and abused by big companies and western interests. But at the center of that story was the very personal story of loss. This was a thriller, it was more visually violent, and instead of a diplomat, it had a mercenary at it's center. The Constant Gardener was an unusual story, both in plot, and also in the way it was told, with it's fractured time and the subliminal fear of big invisible evils. In 'Blood Diamond' there is more overt violence, and also may I say a far more challenging role for the lead actor. And DiCaprio does a fine job, his accent did go a couple of times - but have any of you tried to mimic a South African accent? Not an easy thing to do because the sound has been distilled from different languages, and the accent itself changes in different areas of the country, and if you listened DiCaprio left Zimbabwe as a child so his accent was SA, and it was good in my opinion. This movie also attempts to bring in more difficult stories, like child soldiers, the exploitation of Africans by Africans - to the benefit of the west and also the rehabilitation of people who have seen and done terrible things. The movie should perhaps instead be compared with the South African movie 'Tsotsi', which was also a story of greed, money, retribution and the possibility of redemption. The main characters in both also lost their parents and knew violence from an early age.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this film is that those who see it will leave knowing more about the lives of average people in these conflicts, and hopefully like Hotel Rwanda it will raise awareness of a tragic conflict that has not only wasn't talked about enough at the time, but has also been forgotten in the west."

","I liked this movie a lot. It was much better than I anticipated based on some very negative reviews -- one of the reasons I tend to ignore professional critics. Although the back-story is distressing, the action is exciting, the scenery is gorgeous and the photography is spectacular. Leonardo DeCaprio, although still eye candy, continues his ascendancy into truly adult roles which first emerged with ""Catch Me if You Can."" His acting is steadily improving, especially after Scorcese's tutelage in ""Gangs of New York,"" ""The Aviator"" & ""The Departed."" For my money, this is DeCaprio's best job to date -- although his turn in ""The Departed"" runs a close 2nd. These are both showy parts and he handles them creditably. Blood Diamonds' plot is somewhat predictable and manipulative, but that really didn't matter to me -- the movie is entertaining yet provocative and the 2 lead male actors are very charismatic. They enjoy a great chemistry. Both ""Oscar"" nominations are well-deserved. Jennifer Connelly's presence is a contrivance but it works as well as can be expected & serves its purpose. I've talked to others who liked this movie and some who didn't -- both male & female. It's worth it to see it and decide for yourself -- unless, of course, you can't stand DeCaprio, because he's in almost every scene. Even so, Honshu is great, as always."
"fertilecelluloid","8","0","0","23 January 2007"," Exciting, provocative work
","A searing, violent drama from director Ed Zwick, whose previous essay on a different kind of combat was ""The Last Samurai"". Danny Archer (Leonardo Di) is a South African opportunist who survives on the edges of Sierra Leone's diamond trade. His loose principles are forced to the surface when he meets Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a simple farmer whose life has been torn apart by the country's civil war. Forced to work in an illegal diamond mine, Vandy discovers a large, rare diamond and manages to bury it for later retrieval. When DiCaprio learns of Vandy's situation, he vows to help him recover the diamond and track down his remaining family members. Despite his star's considerable matinée power, Zwick is not afraid to portray him as a desperado prepared to kill and kill again when necessary. The ""blood diamond"" of the title refers to the illegal arm of the diamond trade where much blood is spilled and many heads are turned so that the blood diamonds can be traded on the legal market. The film explores the illicit trade and implicates everybody, though it also makes it clear that this is just one sinister aspect of the business. Essentially a bloody adventure with Hollywood production values, ""Blood Diamond"" does meander ccasionally and risks becoming repetitious. Still, it is an exciting, provocative work."

"Mxzplk","Null","0","0","11 January 2007"," For a Good Cause: Blood Diamond, with Leonardo DiCaprio, exposes the suffering that the illegal stones buys in Africa
","Blood Diamond is a fast-paced thriller and a vigorous entertainment. And it is also a movie with a declared mission: to instruct the audience of the suffering that the diamond reservations imposes or imposed to the African countries that possesses them. The called ""conflit diamonds"" are rough stones panned in regions dominated by guerrillas. Extracted almost always by slave work, they are delivered through subterfuges to the classifieds of London and Antuerpia, and them dispatched to the regular trading in all the world. They finance, at this moment, the killing spree at the Ivory Coast. At Serra Leoa, the chosen scenario by director Edward Zwick for Blood Diamond, the United Revolutionary Front (URF) used the illegal gems to pay for more then one decade of violence, between 1991 and 2002. Many countries in the continent live legitimately of their diamonds - as Angola and Serra Leoa really, since they left civil war. But, where they fall on the hands of guerrillas, the stones buy by loads the typical disgraces of the continent: violence, hunger, corruption and the expulsion of entire populations from the coveted zones.<br/><br/>It would be even possible to suspect opportunism here, since movies such as Hotel Rwanda, The Constant Gardener and even this same Blood Diamond make of Africa the cause of the moment for Hollywood. But Zwick's thriller conjugates what is best in this formula of entertainment with conscience. Leonardo DiCaprio, in another excellent performance, is Danny Archer, citizen of Zimbabue (that he calls for the colonial name of Rodesia), ex-soldier of the south African elite and actual weapons dealer for guerrilla fighters - a professional option nothing of uncommon for white africans with his qualifications. It is 1999, year which the civil war in Serra Leoa accomplished a state of paroxysm, and it isn't fiction the mere joke portrayed on the film, in which the guerrilla fighters puts entire villagers in line and, with machete on hand, makes them extend their arms and ask if they prefer ""short sleeve"" or ""long sleeve"". By chance, the road of Danny will cross with one of these civilians: Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounson), fisherman that lost a son to the guerrilla and was directed to a gold panning. Solomon finds, and hides, a fabulous pink diamond. But the rumors about the stone starts to spread, attracting the attention of Danny and Maddy (Jennifer Connely), a journalist that sees on the mercenary a chance for a story about the complicity of the diamond industry with the illegal mining. Danny, Solomon and Maddy are figures that have much more in common with the world of celluloid - but, thanks to a competent script, they act as if they were on the real world, using one another to accomplish their diversed goals.<br/><br/>With this marriage of adventure, drama and, off course, romance, Edward Zwick makes a movie far superior to The Last Samurai and The Siege. There is no action missing in Blood Diamond. And there is no missing as well clarity in the manner which the film brushes the crudity of life in a volatile Africa, with its guerrilla boys, the white soldiers without legitimate function, the peregrination over the refugee camps, the devastation of the city and field. Signs that Blood Diamond touches on a sensible area is that the diamond industry crafted a campaign of public relations to boast the efficiency of the called Kimberley Process - system that obligates the signed governments to detail the trajectory of every stone, since the pan of origin. Even Nelson Mandela, the uncontested moral authority of Africa, manifested preoccupation about the effects of the movie. An indiscriminate boycotting to the diamonds of the country, he defended, would ruin the economies that has in the legitimate extraction their largest source of income, such as South Africa, Botsuana and Namibia. According to the industry, since 2003 the Kimberly Process reduced from 4% total to 1% the circulation of ""conflict diamonds"". In a market of 60 billions dollars, which means that, for each year, there is still left 600 million dollars to buy violence with in Africa. It is for these that, very appropriately, Blood Diamond intends to call attention for."

","Blood Diamond is probably the last great film of 2006, a pretty great year for movies. Directed by Edward Zwick and written by Charles Levatt, it is an action flick, I guess. Or a drama. Or both.<br/><br/>It centers on a man named Solomon Vandy (played to perfection by Djimon Honsou) who finds a large ""pink"" diamond in the rivers of Sierra Leone. Suddenly, his camp is invaded by government soldiers, but Vandy buries the diamond just before he is taken into custody. Meanwhile, a diamond smuggler, Danny Archer (in another great performance by DiCaprio) is caught smuggling diamonds across the border to Lebanon (?), and is jailed for a short period. He meets Vandy in prison and decides to use him to 1)find the pink and steal it, and 2)maybe, just maybe find Solomon's family (who's eldest son is kidnapped and brainwashed by rebel soldiers).<br/><br/>They set off on a journey across Africa, and with the help of journalist Matty Bowen (in yet another great acting job by Jennefer Connelly), they search for the pink, as well as Solomon's family.<br/><br/>As Richard Roeper stated: ""Edward Zwick is the master of politically correct thrillers"". Well, I wholeheartedly agree with him. Glory, The Last Samaurai, and the Siege were spectacular and suspenseful pictures with great acting, and I'm going to chalk this up onto that list as well. There are some great action set pieces that had me on the edge of my seat. But Zwick and cinematographer Eduardo Serra make it look easy.<br/><br/>James Newton Howard also contributes to the film with his wonderful score. His strings work and the African vocalist pieces are great, adding to the grim mood of the film. On a similar subject, the sound design is great as well. You can actually feel the bullets zipping by on screen with Christopher Assells' sound editing--it works as a complete synchronous style with Howard's score.<br/><br/>But I will hand it to the actors. They are the ones who truly delivered this film. This is DiCaprio's second film of the year (the first being The Departed), and he gives a great performance as the cynical Danny Archer.<br/><br/>Djimon Honsou is one of my favorite actors, so, naturally, I liked his work in this. But it isn't that I simply ""liked"" his work in this--he gave THE best performance in the movie. He handles the role of Solomon Vandy as if he IS Solomon. A truly moving character.<br/><br/>This is Jennefer Connelly's second best performance in her career I think (the first being Requiem For A Dream). She plays Matty Bowen, journalist for Vital Affairs magazine. She shows how great an actress she can actually be, but it will never top her Requiem acting.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is violent, gritty, suspenseful, poignant, sad, and long. Clocking in at two hours and forty minutes, it is worth every scene.<br/><br/>Great film that should be nominated for Best Picture."

","In the midst of civil war in Sierra Leone, South Africa ex-mercenary Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) confesses to American reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), ""God left this place (the world) a long time ago"" DiCaprio is powerful and poignant. This is the unforgiving and savage world of Director Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"". Writers Charles Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell tell the story of African ""conflict diamonds"" that are brokered to Antwerp, Belgium stained with the blood of enslaved laborers, merciless gangs, and ruthless mercenaries.<br/><br/>Maddy (Connelly) is in Sierra Leone to expose the diamond conspiracy that generates a glut of diamonds yet imposes a perceived scarcity that drives the market demand. Danny (DiCaprio) is her only credible inside source on the ""conflict diamond"" market. Although mutually attracted to Maddy, Danny is invariably tied to Mende fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), who possesses the whereabouts of a rare and valuable pink diamond. Solomon escaped imprisonment in a diamond mine operation and is in search of his displaced family; including his son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers), captured and trained by a violent gang. Initially, Danny's motives are driven by greed that transforms to heroic selflessness. Leonardo DiCaprio is mesmerizing and powerful in Danny's character arc. I never really got DiCaprio's star quality, until now. DiCaprio is older, filled out and decidedly manly as Danny. He brings such a passion and rugged intensity to the role. Also compelling is his chemistry with the strong Jennifer Connelly as Maddy, who believes in Danny's best. There is a touchingly eloquent scene with the two when Danny tells Maddy, ""You find yourself a good man"" DiCaprio is powerful as a man flawed and ultimately a hero. Connelly is equally powerful, smart with great compassion. She is so compelling, particularly in her silence. Hounsou is truly a commanding force. He is electrifying as the courageous father seeking to reunite his stolen family. Hounsou captures the anguish and strength as the loving and dedicated father and husband.<br/><br/>Edward Zwick (""The Last Samurai"", ""Glory"") is the masterful storyteller. Zwick along Leavitt and Mitchell give us a glimpse of poverty stricken Africa ruled by ruthless regimes where young men have their hands chopped to prevent them from voting. Lives are expendable. Diamonds are everything. Zwick also keeps the story moving with crisp action, and high drama. Unlike the confessed resignation of Danny that God left the world a long time ago, Zwick tells his story of good men who act. Leonardo DiCaprio's Danny and Hounsou's Solomon symbolize this. Reminiscent of ""Three Kings"", the self interested Danny surrenders to his own nobility and grace. DiCaprio is so engaging and compellinghe gives his best performance. Jennifer Connelly is amazing, both radiant and powerful. Though in a supporting role, she grounds the movie. Her Maddy sees the greatness in Danny, and her faith is unyielding. ""Blood Diamond"" concludes in great catharsis. Things don't always end as we wish. But the world is a greater place when good men choose to act out of conscience and valor. Zwick poignantly reminds of this in his ""Blood Diamond"". It is one of the year's best."

Let me reassure you, after seeing this (and the Departed),He is not that sissy pretty boy he was in Titanic. He has grown up and this movie really shows it. As my gf and I walked out of the theater, got in the car, and drove home, there wasn't much said between us. You don't really want to talk about it. It evokes such strong and powerful emotions, that it almost leaves you speechless. You just think, wow, that was amazing but at the same time, you realize that what you just watched actually is going on over there. I felt like driving straight to my bank and donating everything that was in my savings account to the people of that country. It's a fairly long movie, but it never leads you astray. The entire time, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It is a very tightly constructed movie and it never loses its focus. From its quick ""throw you right in the middle of it"" beginning to the powerful end, the movie will captivate you. I will be greatly disappointed if the movie doesn't receive best picture come Oscar time.<br/><br/>(FYI, I've been coming to this sight forever now, but I don't like to type...so this is the first review I have ever written, and thus, posted...so I apologize if it didn't make much sense)"

","Just watched the movie and I was amazed! First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio becomes a real man and his performance is amazing! I mean, they all said that he was great in the Departed but in Blood Diamond he is really really in the character! Definitely Oscar worthy! Jennifer Connely and Djimon Hounsou, simply complete the great chemistry! Ed Zwick did pick a great subject for the movie, very touching and gave it to us with lots of responsibility! The photography of the movie was unbelievable, especially the sunsets and the natural green. And of course the messages of the movie are so many and it truly makes us see some things that we take for granted, well.. to take another look and try to be happy with all we have!"
"Solipsisticblog","8","0","0","30 December 2006"," Performances give ""Diamond"" its luster
","The name Edward Zwick makes me a little uneasy. This is the director who brought us the Harlequin-ready ""Legends of the Fall"" and the overwrought ""The Last Samurai"". He also gave us the outstanding ""Glory"" and the intriguing ""Courage Under Fire"". His films are rarely subtle and often leave you feeling browbeaten in their attempts to move you.<br/><br/>But his film ""Blood Diamond"" works. Why? First, Djimon Hounsou gives a raw and mesmerizing performance as Solmoan Vandy, a fisherman swept up in the civil war and violent diamond trade of Siera Leone in 1990. The opening moments of the film are startlingly similar to those of ""Apocalypto"" as Solomon tries to rescue his family from a rapacious crew invading his small village. Solomon eventually finds himself on a mission to recover his family after they are separated in the escape. This mission brings him into contact crafty diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who learns that Solomon knows the location to a large pink diamond that will make its owner a very rich man.<br/><br/>The two form an uneasy alliance and enlist the help of danger-seeking and principled reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) who is trying to write a damning expose of the African diamond trade. As the film progresses, we see the violent destruction wrought by roving militias, largely made up of children and teenagers, at the service of vicious mercenaries who provide diamonds to legitimate, established diamond wholesalers. The full extent of the destruction wrought by the scheme is horrifying, particularly in the toll it takes on the country's young men. This is a message movie, but it is not polarizing. This isn't a left or right-leaning film, rather it is one that asks us to consider the consequences of our purchases.<br/><br/>DiCaprio continues to mature as an actor and lends the standard role--mercenary who is forced to grapple with his conscience--vitality. He adds to the richness of this film that will surely move even the most jaded of moviegoers."

","Stars: Leo DiCaprio, Djimon Honsou and Jennifer Connelly.<br/><br/>Wow!! That's all I can really say after watching this. Everything about this was great. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a jerk that cares only about himself, and he still manages to be an extremely likable character with a lot of development. Djimon Honsou gave an excellent performance as the determined father trying to get to his brainwashed son. Jennifer Connelly plays a held back, excellent role as the American reporter. Blood Diamond houses some excellent performances. It takes place in 1994 in several countries in Africa that are going in to complete anarchy, with kids being brainwashed and used as soldiers. Solomen's (Honsou) family is taken and he alone is left to save them by finding the biggest diamond he saw and buried. Billy (DiCaprio) meets Solomen in jail and gets him out. Billy sells diamonds illegally and wants this one. Pretty simple plot. Warning, this film is very intense. If you don't mind watching little kids get shot and have their hands chopped off, then you are the right person for this excellent film.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 133 mins.

","Walking out of Hotel Rwanda I was challenged to explain why I was the only one of my group who thought that it lacked, why its story seemed to remain on the surface. I never felt it did the genocide's' justice. Having watched BLOOD DIAMOND it was made perfectly clear to me why I felt that way during Hotel Rwanda; in BLOOD DIAMOND we watch a long, but well told tale of the atrocities that existed in the 80's and 90's in the race for diamonds.<br/><br/>The truth of that period is well known, and director Edward Zwick does well to make the film grounded in truth through representation of the struggle as history says it was. Rather than watering down the violence, and the pain that results, Zwick puts the viewer on the ground, in a run for their life.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connolly all commanded the screen, each possessing differing morals and personal direction; and in both cases much of their existence seemed to be ultimately determined by the civil wars of Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>Dicaprio is convincing as a White African, with his Southern African slang, and Hounsou appears firm, solid in this role as a father and man of great conviction; he is strong. And Connolly, always bright, strong delivery; with a passionate eloquence that adds a sincerity to the films telling that had a calming effect on the films jarring action.<br/><br/>At some point during the film I can imagine that many people watching thought to themselves, ""was the struggle there this bad?"", the film does not shy away from taking its narrative directly into the heart of the struggle, often times it feels like struggle is following them. As the story plays out it becomes journey, a search for a diamond and a search for a son; it is all of the experiences that along the way that make the journey of this film most enjoyable."

The reason I went to see it was because I think Dicaprio is one of the finer actors of today. Reality is sometimes hard to deal with and this movie brought a lot home; and makes you wonder if some of the jewels we wear so proudly that they could they possibly be blood diamonds. Maybe some of don't want to think that hard. The story, acting and directing was marvelous. I cringed at first saying to myself ""too much information"". Reality what a concept.

","Tugging on the emotions of viewers, keeping people on the edge of seats, Blood Diamond is supreme in its ability to engage the sense of adventure, the horror of American greed and how it effects those who come near it. Behind the lust for money and diamonds can be seen the desperation that greed can bring about and the dehumanizing that is the result, or vice versa. The audience is asked in the beginning of the movie to see the events through the eyes of an African man separated from his family as well as through the eyes of a smuggler and a journalist.

"roland-104","7","0","0","26 December 2006"," Leo DiCaprio plays a soldier of fortune who discovers morality
","Based on the trailer, I really didn't expect much from this movie  lots of action maybe but not a whole lot more. Wrong. It's a good enough flick, long on action to be sure. But, beyond that, based on what I've read, it is a more-or-less accurate depiction of circumstances during the on-again-off-again civil war that played out in Sierra Leone from 1991 to 2002.<br/><br/>During that terrible time, hundreds of thousands of ordinary peasant citizens were slaughtered and exploited by armed rebel militias, principally cadres of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), and also by government forces supposedly charged to protect these folks from the rebels. At the very least, many people found themselves lethally caught in a no man's land between the RUF and the Army. Refugees piled out of the most hotly contested areas and into holding camps.<br/><br/>The film narrative takes place in this context of violence and chaos. Danny Archer (Leo DiCaprio) is a renegade gun merchant and adventurer from Zimbabwe, on hand to make a buck selling weapons to the RUF. His love interest is American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) but there isn't really any time for love or lovemaking between attacks in this Hell on earth. So one unexpected plus in the film is the downplaying of romance in favor of another form of bonding and fidelity. For that the partner of interest is not Bowen but a Mende tribe peasant fisherman, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou).<br/><br/>Vandy's village and family have been torn asunder by the RUF, who kidnap Vandy's young teen son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) and turn him into a killer. An RUF cadre leader, nicknamed ""Capt. Poison"" (David Harewood), serves as Dia's mentor and father surrogate, supplying political guidance and, ironically, almost tender approval for Dia's increasingly brutal soldiering. Vandy himself is indentured by the RUF and supervised at gunpoint working on a crew of prisoners busily extracting diamonds from a jungle patch to finance the RUF cause.<br/><br/>Vandy escapes, he and Archer are unexpectedly thrown together, and, when Archer learns that Vandy has buried a gigantic diamond back in the jungle, he becomes Vandy's best buddy ever, vowing to lead Vandy to his family and the diamond, profits from which they will split. The trio of Archer, Vandy and Bowen plunge into an intensely contested battle zone, and the action sequences commence in earnest.<br/><br/>It's a match made in Heaven: Vandy and Archer, that is. They manage their characters' roles and increasingly interdependent relationship with great skill. I think DiCaprio has been growing lately into a first rate adult actor, based on his work here and in the recent Martin Scorsese film, ""The Departed."" He's bulked up physically and seems to have matured into manhood in his last two films.<br/><br/>At age 31, when these recent films were made, he's no longer the troubled kid of ""Basketball Diaries,"" the unconvincing slick operator kid in ""Catch Me If You Can,"" nor does he seem miscast as an adult, as he did in ""The Aviator."" Granted, his characters in ""The Departed"" and ""Blood Diamond"" have much in common: in both DiCaprio is four parts whip smart toughness and one part tender vulnerability. But the point is that he has grown into such roles and performs them with aplomb.<br/><br/>The film suffers towards the end when Archer single-handedly takes on a huge RUF contingent plus a government attack force that Archer himself had called in on the rebels' stronghold. It's a page from Sly Stallone's book of go-it-alone guerrilla warfare. Having worked so hard and effectively to build a credible character capable of moral transformation, DeCaprio doesn't deserve this fatuous Hollywood fate. I do suppose that this one-man-standing-against-the-world-of-evil baloney sells theater tickets and DVDs. Sigh. Beyond this insult to our intelligence, the film is edifying, exciting and believable.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","24 December 2006"," Good mainstream action entertainment with a credible ""conscience"" message
","(Watched in Toronto) <br/><br/>Can't remember when (or maybe it's always been that way) Hollywood started to mix an ingredient of political/social conscience in mainstream adventure/action movies. ""The constant gardener"" and ""Syriana"" are two that immediately come to mind but there must be plenty of others. ""Blood diamond"" can be ranked with the better ones.<br/><br/>The ""conscience"" element here is the atrocity resulting (at least partly) from diamond mining and smuggling in an African country, Sierra Leone to be exact, in the 90's. On the macro scale, we see ravaging civil war, brutal treatment of the innocent, shocking breeding (not literally) of child warriors, none of which is easy to stomach, and the combination of which invokes a nauseating hell. The movie makers spare no pain (in both length and details) in creating on screen an infernal that comes close to ""Apocalypse now"". There were in fact scenes that, quite conspicuously, referenced that movie of movies when it comes to depicting the hell resulting from war.<br/><br/>The mainstream adventure and actions come from two intertwining stories, honest fisherman Solomon Vandy's (Djimon Hounson) desperate effort to look for his family lost after a raid of his village and diamond smuggler Danny Archer's (Leonard DiCaprio) scheme to pull off one big deal which will allow him to leave forever the continent in which he was born and had a haunting childhood. Added to that is American journalist Maddy Bowen's (Jennifer Connelly) quest to write a story to expose the evil of the ""blood diamond"" trade.<br/><br/>Despite being too long (138 minutes) and mostly predictable, ""Blood diamond"" is a movie that is worth watching in the cinema (better still the giant ""Silver City"" franchise screens in Toronto). Breathtaking African landscapes aside, there are also action sequences at pandemonium proportions, the impact of which would be lost watching at home (even granting a good home entertainment system).<br/><br/>On an intimate scale, there is good acting as the movie, while starting slowly and with some suggestions of banality, does simmer to a few emotional scenes towards the end that are commendable. DiCarprio, playing the selfish mercenery with still a conscience buried deep inside (not exactly an unfamiliar character), is good enough to get a Golden Globe nomination to go with his other one from ""The departed"". Djimon Hounson, who is quite unforgettable in ""The four feathers"", is perfectly cast for the absolutely honest, simple, family-loving fisherman caught in the vortex of a hostile world. Jennifer Connelly can probably play the idealistic, determined young journalist in her sleep, but what she also brings to the screen is beauty and grace that is impossible not to fall in love with."

","For a while I used to think Leo DiCaprio was a half-baked actor. Though THE AVIATOR was a good flick and was well-portrayed, it wasn't the kind of character I wanted to see him as. In BLOOD DIAMOND, Leo's Danny Archer, a white African mercenary working for the highest bidder, is the kind of character I like to see.<br/><br/>Usually when I think of Africa, many things come to my mind: names like Mobutu Sese Seko, Idi Amin, Colonel Muammar Qadaffi, Marshal Omar Bashir, Mohammed Farrah Aidid; warlords and displaced governments; genocide; civil wars; CHAOS. BLOOD DIAMOND has all that and more. When you think of the Afrikaner people, Apartheid probably comes to mind. However, Apartheid is the least of our characters' worries.<br/><br/>If you like bling-blang and edge of your seat action, then BLOOD DIAMOND is for you. I am an action junkie myself, and LOVE paramilitary quest and buddy movies. I also like it when the movie draws me in so much that I'm swinging punches as the good guy is fighting the bad guy. This movie is by far one of the best this year has had to offer, and by far it is the return of Leo DiCaprio, if not the First Coming.<br/><br/>Djimon Honsou gives a performance so passionate and authentic that his character and his story are unbelievably believable. His character would probably need a shrink after what he goes through.<br/><br/>I would give BLOOD DIAMOND five stars on a four-star scale... that's how good it was.

The movie touches on so many important issues in Africa--child soldiers, refugees, race, border relations...I can't even explain how great this movie is, just go see it! Everyone should be aware of the conflicts (that have been around since colonialism) that stem from resources such as diamonds, oil etc., but most Americans are not interested. Millions of innocent, hard working people have been forced from their homes due to conflict over resources that Westerners demand and also take for granted. This Christmas we should all think about selling that diamond Ring and giving the money to an organization working with Congolese refugees. Conflict stemming from rebel activity, such as that in the movie, in combination with illegal mining for Gold and Diamonds has killed millions and forced hundreds of thousands of Congolese people from their homes.

My only regret is that I didn't know more about the history of diamond trade before seeing this movie- but my-God, I will certainly try to learn more now. What I liked most about this film- more than the incredible acting be EVERYONE in it- was that at its core was the message that consumer choices we make in western (Global North/first world) nations are directly related to the decolonized and economically enslaved nations that are tied to us (like those in Africa) that have such a small voice in the world. The diamond trade is just one example. Yet it also demonstrates the burden of knowledge, and how simply knowing- as consumers, governments, media, etc...- the facts about goods produced through the blood of others can create a moral obligation that forces all of us to make choices about the kind of legacy that we, as the economic (but certainly not moral) leaders and dictators of the world, want to leave for future generations.

Africa is represented as a ruined motherland who's people, white or black, are suffering. All this while the overpopulated capitalist fascist countries live soaked in their own desires and greed. The movie does not intend to mold people's minds,but i think eventually it strikes one or another on the terms of ""just where things come from, or how they come from and for what purpose"". I think the movie has successfully got the feeling of what a few countries and it's people have gone through and what's still happening in a good part of them. As for the cast, i personally have always disliked Di Caprio but, i have to admit that he might have gotten his second best performance in his actor life (along with the beach). Not only did he give the character some sneakiness but also pure life into it, almost as if he really identified himself with it (not referring to the military moves), it seemed he was used to ""cheating"" and ""smuggling"" since the cradle. Jennifer Connelly looked like the angriest and sexiest woman ever like most of her movies, which is not to be surprised having in mind some of her performances. Djimon Hounsou was the biggest revelation in my opinion, sounding in every speech like a true martyr and a real family boss.<br/><br/>I gave it 10/10 not for the performances, although they were way above average, but for the educational purposes of the movie, it combined a great story with good characters and the sadness of our world's reality."

","Blood Diamond is the latest film that discusses the ever-growing violence in Africa. The plot of the film is rather simple. Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a fisherman in South Africa, who is taken by rebels to work in the diamond mines. The same rebels also take his son and begin to mold him into a soldier. Leonardo DiCaprio is Danny Archer, a Zimbabwe mercenary turned diamond smuggler. The two meet in prison after DiCaprio gets caught smuggling diamonds and the mine that Hounsou worked at was raided by government forces. However, before the government forces stormed the mine, Hounsou found and hid a diamond that is worth a fortune. Archer and Vandy team up to find the diamond, Archer wanting money and Vandy wanting to get his family back.<br/><br/>A film like this lives and dies on the shoulders of the actors. Luckily, director Edward Zwick was able to get two of the best actors around for the roles. DiCaprio gives his best performance of his life in the film. Trailers had me worried at the beginning with his accent, but it works perfectly in the film. He plays the arrogant, asshole character very well and causes the audience to keep guessing on what his character may do next. I would give him an Oscar nomination for this over The Departed. Hounsou has a very difficult character to play. Due to his built, he is a very intimidating person. However, his character in the film is very different. Vandy is polite, soft spoken, and is only a violent man when his family is in danger. DiCaprio and Hounsou have great chemistry and watching their character's friendship grow as the film progressive is exciting to see. Jennifer Connelly also stars as Maddy Bowen, a journalist and love interest to Archer. Her character really was underused and did not serve much of a purpose until the last 10 to 15 minutes. Connelly was good in the limited time she was used but the love story did not work very well and seem somewhat forced.<br/><br/>The violence in the film surprised me a lot. I was not expecting a lot of gore but I was very surprised. The audience saw hands cut off, heads blown apart, and blood, lots of blood. However, none of the violence took away from the story, the violence was there to show just what was happening in Africa and I credit Zwick for doing it as tasteful as possible. The direction of the film was perfect. There were some beautiful shots in the film, especially the final shot in Africa. It really showed how beautiful the country could be if there was not so much death and destruction.<br/><br/>The plot seemed tough to believe at first. I just could not buy Vandy allying himself with Archer. Vandy held all the cards and did not need to deal Archer in but for some reason he did. I slowly bought into it though and this allowed me to enjoy the film. The movie really was a character study on how two people so opposite who believed opposite things could get along and start to become friends. Towards the end of the third act you could feel for these characters and wanted their friendship to last outside of Africa even if you knew that it would not. The movie is a bit predictable but it still does not take away how powerful the film really is.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved this film. I thought it was almost perfect in everyway. If DiCaprio and Hounsou are not nominated for Oscars after their roles, then the Academy really has lost it. The direction is near perfect and the soundtrack was great.<br/><br/>Review by Jay, written for film site www.boxofficefanatic.com"

","Some have noted this movie as a heavy message movie, others that it is too much of a formula type plot; but I saw a well paced action drama with just the right amount of reality to let you know what really happened with diamond mining in Africa. DiCaprio has his accent down - didn't take long for me to adjust to it and Djimon Hounsou showed he is a consistently thoughtful actor that seems to have really taken this role to heart. The movie went by quickly with just the right amount of tension between the characters to keep your interest in what was going to happen next. I'm not a big Jennifer Connelly fan so her role could have been played by anyone but it was credible enough to keep me involved when she was on the scene.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this film because it hasn't been a great year for movies but now it seems a few goods are making their way to us and Blood Diamond is definitely one of the best.

"mvpolyakov","7","0","0","18 December 2006"," It reaches for greatness but has flaws
","The movie has greatness but it is not perfect; it has both flaws and problems - these are not the same thing. DeCaprio and Connelly and especially Hounsou do a great job. DeCaprio's accent may not be constant and whatever, but it's cute. There're flaws - he insists reprising his Titanic death scene - the noble steed dying. But even that's improving; if you don't see Titanic and thus are oblivious to the kitsch factor, it is quite a touching scene - and paired well with Connelly who I think is well picked for the role. It would have been good to get a little more development from her. <br/><br/>There are also problems though. The brutality of the child war is not necessarily out of place - but its setting (to use a metaphor) is wrong/weak. It certainly is an important thing to show and I applaud its inclusion. It is shocking -- it is like that moment in Constant Gardner developed much further - it does for child war what Terrorist did for ""freedom fighting/terrorism"". The problem is that while in movies like City of God it seems to belong within the movie, here it still somehow doesn't fit -- may be the movie has a Hollywood feel and the brutal violence just doesn't jibe. Or may be it was just too abrupt. <br/><br/>The other problem is DeCaprio's character. He's an efficient soldier, and we get the expected open-hearted chat about his traumatic childhood in the tet-a-tete scene with Connelly - but there ought to be more. There's a brief scene with Solomon where we get a glimpse of the ferocity really underneath his skin - but its left unmentioned. I think important scenes were cut for the release. But it does well other than that - it tells a good story, it has great actors who do a good job; it raises a vital social issue and shows us a whole other world, a whole other life - it is much like City of God but from a Hollywood angle (which means it must be about a diamond and have a proper plot flow). 7.5 out of 10"

","Blood Diamond gathers many strains, but the two main ones involve self-styled Rhodesian mercenary Danny Archer (Leonardo di Caprio) and fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou). Vandy's village is wiped out in the violence of Sierra Leone's civil war and, separated from wife and children, he's spared on-the-spot execution but forced to work in a diamond mine  in the open air, but guarded by men with guns who shoot to kill. Somehow nonetheless he finds a huge ""pink"" diamond that he manages to hide. In the chaos of the war Solomon's son Dia gets turned into a boy soldier. The minute Solomon hides the big diamond he's imprisoned, but Danny gets him out because word of the find has spread through Soloman's brutal boss, also in the jail. Danny and Solomon are now linked: only Solomon can retrieve the diamond, but he needs Danny to get it to the buyers. The two men have many adventures together in which Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connolly) a journalist, becomes involved because she can get Solomon and Danny into and out of places through her press credentials and she wants a payback from Danny for her help: names and lines of power in the diamond smuggling business he's involved with.<br/><br/>Edward Zwick's film is quite simply an adventure of character  with a background of violent African civil war and corrupt economics in which the African people are exploited by the rich white men who still run the world. Danny is a hardened man who has seen everything and shifted from any pretense of fighting for politics or ideas to things. He uses a weapon when he needs to, which in a country under civil war is pretty often, but smuggling gems to Liberia is his focus now and he does it for an unscrupulous company that deals in ""conflict diamonds"" -- ones with an ugly background because they've been traded to buy weapons. ""In America it's bling bling,"" Danny says, ""but over here it's bling bang.""<br/><br/>Di Caprio's character is a burnt-out case at thirty-five, stripped of values but with enormous toughness, resiliency, and survival skills. He has a noble, stoical finale worth of the best Hemingway hero, as played by Bogart or Peck or another of the great Hollywood male icons. Still short of thirty-five, playing a role so rich and attractive any actor of his talent would have been a damned fool not to take it on, Di Caprio shows here if he hasn't before that he has left the reedy boy behind and grown definitively into adult parts. If the actor's accent is obvious or inaccurate as some say, it just doesn't matter. Such comments must be based on the trailer. The action doesn't give you time to think about accents.<br/><br/>Di Caprio's face is lined, with a wry grin that reminds you of Orson Welles. He's forever puffing on a cigarette (""They'll kill you."" ""Only if you live."") and swigging liquor, able to catch and kill and skin a monkey for food at the drop of a switchblade. He and Jennifer have a tough-guy tough-gal romance. Both their characters are without illusions. Danny resists Maddy's prying, Maddy his manipulations. Each comes to admire the other's panache. (""You were good today."" So were you."") <br/><br/>As Solomon Vandy Hounsou is the noble African, loving but heroically strong, able to endure anything to reunite with his wife and kids and tame Dia into becoming a son again and not a boy killer. Breathless as its narrative is, Blood Diamond has plenty of intense emotional encounters; its ability to find the time for both action and feeling is what makes it a great movie. The most emotionally powerful moment is nothing between Danny and Maddy, but the time when Solomon begs his son to accept him again and return to being a boy in a family.<br/><br/>As for critiques of the film as demeaning to Africans or inaccurate about its economic and political background, they smack of the foregone conclusion, and show little attention to what's in the film or what it's trying to do. If you want a documentary you will go elsewhere; you'll be lucky to find as unbiased and wide-ranging an analysis, or as palpable a picture of what Africa at war today is like. The focus here is on how men and women function under pressure. The specifics of background are intelligent, but not the main point.<br/><br/>The picture also has balance in the way it informs us but does not lecture us. The boy killers and conflict diamonds and mercenaries, the burned villages and amputated hands and the million-strong refugee camps that the world forgets, the smuggling and the diamond companies that buy up and store gems in vaults to keep up the price of what they sell (that will include the huge one, which they pay only two million pounds for)  these are all facts that enrich the background of an intelligent and up-to-date but essentially old-fashioned adventure story. This feels like a real movie. Call it a popcorn movie. It's not art house stuff. But like some of the best cinema or drama or literature, it can be appreciated and enjoyed on many levels, by audiences ranging from naïve to sophisticated. It's very well made and very well conceived. Good for Zwick and everybody concerned!"

","How to tell a story: Take three characters who each want something different that is in conflict with what the others want but connected and go from there.<br/><br/>I suppose Danny Archer (DiCaprio) is the protagonist but my wife and I had a discussion about it after the movie because there's a good case to be made that Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) was as well. She made the point that Danny drives the story, that it's his want--the diamond and escape from Africa--that makes the story go forward. But it may well be that the real performance in this movie was Hounsou who takes us from rage to tenderness in seconds in the climactic scenes. Despite some pretty negative discussion about her in the discussions here, I think Connelly fitted her role and did it well.<br/><br/>If the movie is flawed it is around the last minute implications of romance between Danny and Maddy Bowen (Connelly) which could, with some suspension of disbelief, be read as human caring between two people who have shared a difficult journey. The one other flaw might have been difficult to handle differently. The diamond business back story is necessary for context but the closing scenes after we see the last of Archer that wrap up the back story seemed unnecessary. They could easily have had the plane taking off be the last scene and the story might have been stronger. Sometimes it doesn't add to a movie to try to tie up everything in a neat little bow.<br/><br/>In summary--hard to watch some parts of this film, but a compelling story well acted."

","For those of you who are hearing about conflict diamonds for the first time, welcome to the real world. This has been going on for decades and continues today. There are literally thousands of journalists from around the world in Africa who report on it everyday. The problem is that we don't really care. we want cheap diamonds (or at least affordable). Also, slavery and genocide is and has been perpetuated by Africans on Africans forever. That doesn't fit in with our politically correct media agenda so it doesn't get reported. The only reason any African nation has any infrastructure is because Europeans colonized it. Take a look at any country there now that all Colonial governments have left and all you see is genocide and war. The revolutionaries who felt subjugated by the Europeans are now the mass murderers and enslavers. The Europeans never did that. Although our media would have you believe that Africa is all milk and honey and that everyone are peace loving fisherman and farmers, its simply not true and never has been. This movie is a metaphor of the DeBeers Diamond Company. For those who don't recognize that name their slogan is Diamonds Are Forever and every woman in the world believes it. They are the real power in Africa and have been for decades.Thats why they are the only company that has survived every war, coup-de-tat, and revolution. Of course Hollywood would not name them seeing as that a good portion of diamonds end up on Rodeo Drive. As for the movie it was fantastic. It presented a world tragedy to the ignorant masses in America and yet lets them go home at night and sleep with a clear conscience. Oh, by the way, all that food aid that goes to the refugee camps, about three quarters goes to the rebels who are killing and maiming. The other one fourth is distributed to the camps and rationed out by United Nations and World Health Organization workers who act like they bought it and that their doing the refugees a favor."

No wonder Mervis has been advertising that their diamonds are not from conflict area which is Sierra Leone in the late 1990's.Leonard DeCaprio is very convincing as a diamond smuggler fighting his own deeper conscience and greed.By showing children conscript soldiers being brainwashed and killing with out regret is probably the most chilling part of the nonfictional aspect of the movie, reinforced at the end by current brutal numerical statistics.

","Blood Diamond takes a look at the diamond business in Sierra Leone in 1999. Most of the diamonds minded in that country at the time were called ""blood diamonds"" because of all the death and destruction they caused. The money from the diamonds were used to buy weapons to start civil wars, massacres, and enslave more people to mine more diamonds. The film might be fictional, but I'm pretty sure exploitation of Africa is still happening everywhere on that continent, whether it's for diamonds, oil, ivory, or any other precious resources.<br/><br/>Thus, before I go into the review, please make sure that any diamonds you buy is NOT a ""conflict diamond"" so you don't support more bloodshed and tragedy in Africa. (I'll get off the soap box now) The movie was good, if only because of the amazing acting talents of Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Honsou, and the unflinching and often explicitly violent depiction of war torn Africa/Sierra Leone. Watching one village after another getting slaughtered for no reason other than ""revolution"" or diamonds was painful (but necessary) to watch. Along with ""Lord of War"" and ""The Constant Gardner"", ""Blood Diamond"" is a film that everyone should see to understand the plight of those who are much more unfortunate than us.<br/><br/>I believe with ""The Departed"" and this movie, Leo should be getting an Oscar nomination soon, and Djimon Honsou was a very capable supporting actor. The storyline was a bit long and dragged out at moments, and some scenes were too sappy, but overall, I give this movie a high score because of the issues it explored and the strong performances (as well as the great cinematography).<br/><br/>Go check it out.

One thing that has gone unnoticed is Jennifer Connely's role, and she has turned in perhaps one of the her best performances ever, and she has this casual ease in which she plays Maggie Bowen. You can almost picture Jennifer in Bosnia, or a war torn country taking pictures.<br/><br/>The film is very frank about it's subject matter, one of which was how young children are brainwashed into being soldiers for the Diamond hunters. The scene in which the children are sent in to slaughter every man, woman and child in a nearby village is one of the most chilling scenes I've even seen. The way the children carry out the genocide with such robotic, cold manner was one of the first things I think about when I think of this film. especially Salomon's son. In a country marred with high school shootings and such plots, this was more impactive then the graphic scenes in which some people are either shot in the face, or have their arms cut off. Now that's powerful direction.<br/><br/>Powerful direction is why the films stays with you after you've seen it. Why some scenes still remain fresh days later.

","With Christmas fast approaching, it is most important to remember that when God sent His Son to save us from ourselves (basically), He already knew our capacity for evil  for choosing poorly, in other words  and that capacity, along with the inextinguishable prerogative of a glimmer of hope, is on full display in ""Blood Diamond,"" the new movie from director Edward Zwick, a stunning character study set against the brutal backdrop of the illegal diamond trade in Africa, and one of the finest movies I ever have seen. Offering incredible acting performances from all of its principals, sweeping cinematography, crisp, cut-to-the-chase dialogue, impeccable pacing and timing, Blood Diamond presents, without preaching, conflicted people with conflicting ideologies and shows what happens when those people and ideologies are thrown into the same melting pot: love and hate, God and godlessness, good and evil, war and peace, selfishness and nationalism and altruism, the powerful and the meek, how the lure of money and power entices and kills, how only those who choose to let go of the things of the fallen can rise above the hell. Along the way of my quest, I have been asked on numerous occasions why anyone would choose to live forever on this seemingly God-forsaken planet in favor of putting off the afterlife's heaven, and Blood Diamond answers succinctly: heaven is where one's heart is. Heaven was here on earth until Adam and Eve turned their hearts away from God (basically they loved what the serpent was telling them more than what God told them), and the fact that evil still exists in this world is testament not to the world being evil, because it remains God's creation, but to the poor choices that His children continue to make  and my argument for choosing to extend one's stay on earth is to fight the good fight against Satan and reclaim for God what Satan deceived us into giving away  for what we chose to give away, we can choose to take back, if only we would, and heaven and earth again will be reunited. Jesus came not only to save us, but also to remind us of the authority God gives us to do His work, and we witness in Blood Diamond that tiny glimmer of hope turn into a brilliant beacon."

His only choice is to form an uneasy alliance with a covetous, crusading ex-mercenary and treasure hunter (DiCaprio) who has the means to find his son in exchange for the location of a rare and priceless diamond. Starts off good, with an intriguing story and rousing since of adventure, but quickly loses momentum, goes on too long, and shifts tone from action-adventure to familiar political propaganda. DiCaprio (once you get past the hokey accent) acquits himself well in an unexpectedly forceful performance, but the film is grounded by Hounsou's riveting, intensely emotional role as a father driven to desperate means. The father-son relationship is by far the most compelling one in the movie, and would have benefited from greater emphasis. **"

Has the rest of the world marginalized the continent in a sort of ""out-of-sight, out-of-mind"" mode of thinking. Unfortunately, there is not enough attention placed upon events taking place across Africa-this movie shines a light on some of the social costs of western consumption habits. Given the level of discontent surrounding the extraction of much of Africa's natural resources we should stop to consider the ramifications of doing nothing in Africa. It raises questions of why Africans treat themselves to brutally, but also why the rest of the world turns a blind-eye to the brutality. It's not just savage behavior, there is a reason behind the collective actions that engenders violence for monetary gain.

"dfranzen70","5","3","8","23 March 2007"," Unimpressive, loud, unmoving
","Blood diamonds are pinkish in nature, and the term ""blood diamond"" refers to the blood spilled by those who were killed during its mining or transfer from the heart of Africa to stores around the world. That much I learned from the movie of the same name, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as an amoral smuggler who teams up with a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou) and an American journalist (Jennifer Connelly). I also learned that huge multinational companies control the diamond market by hoarding all the diamonds. Actually, I knew that part already.<br/><br/>Denny Archer (DiCaprio) sells guns to rebels in Sierra Leone in exchange for diamonds, which he then turns over to a diamond cartel. Pretty nice gig, really, especially since apparently everyone in Sierra Leone is in on it except for the poor souls who have to mine the stuff. The revolutionaries rampage through villages, killing most of the citizens, including the women and children, and taking the men to work in the diamond mines. Some of the male children are taken to be ""baby killers"" among the rebels. So you see, everyone has a nice job.<br/><br/>Until the day that Solomon (Hounsou), mining in a creek for the rebels against his will, comes across a pink stone described as being about the size of a bird's egg. (It's never mentioned which bird, though.) As the rebels are being bombed by the government, Solomon buries the stone. But of course he's been spotted, and the rest of the movie is spent by everyone trying to get his or her hands on it to get out of Africa in one piece.<br/><br/>One of those people is Archer. At first you get the impression that he's sort of a summa-cum-Indy, an adventurer who looks like he's out for himself but deep down is a right respectable bastard who'll save a pretty girl and prevent an innocent man from being stabbed. Well, he's sort of that person, in that he'll save the pretty girl (Connelly), as long as he still gets his money. Kind of a low-rent Han Solo, really, only without the cool ride. At any rate, while in jail in Sierra Leone, Archer overhears a captured rebel commander accuse the also-imprisoned Solomon of hiding a big ol' diamond. And that, apparently, is all Archer needs to know, as he gets Solomon bailed out for the sole purpose of getting him to lead Archer to the diamond.<br/><br/>To accomplish this, Archer joins forces with Maddy (Connelly), a journalist looking for the real story of the rape of the African continent. She knows the diamond cartels are behind all the mayhem but can't print anything without anyone willing to go on the record with names and dates and other information. Of course, the swaggering Archer might be that person. Might they strike a deal? Oh, even better yet - perhaps they'll fall in love with each other, running through the jungles and plains? Leonardo DiCaprio could wear a four-foot beard and still look about sixteen years old. He can't disguise his youthfulness with a somewhat-acceptable Afrikaans accent (Archer is supposed to be from Rhodesia, aka Zimbabwe). And were we supposed to root for him or against him? In the hands of a skilled actor, ambiguous intentions can lend an air of mystery to a character, but it's a delicate chore; otherwise, you wind up not really caring if the guy's supposed to be good or bad. Such it is with Archer. I got it. He's in it for himself. Okay, I wondered, now what? Give me a reason why I should care if he dies, if all he's after is the diamond, no matter the cost of human life.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Hounsou is exceptional as a man who's quiet life has been incontrovertibly rent asunder by the invading rebel forces, which kidnap his son and turn him against his own people, and the government itself, which quarantines all refugees with the idea that it's too tough to tell which refugees are with the rebels and which are not. Having lost nearly everything save his own dignity, Solomon does not break, but bends when he must. His urgent need is to reunite with his family and restore order to their lives. Nothing else matters; he sees his diamond as a way out of everything.<br/><br/>Completing the troika is Connelly, who offers a somewhat distaff performance as the naive, unlikeable journo Maddy. Why would Maddy feel compelled to help Archer? Oh, that's right, he's Leonardo DiCaprio. The blunt sexual tension gets to be a bit too much at times; try to avoid screaming ""oh, just get on with it, already!"" at the screen. Connelly's done much better work than here, of course. It's just that she seems so listless, almost bored at times by the proceedings, like she can't quite believe she's in this junky, pseudoaction movie.<br/><br/>We're supposed to take away from this movie the central message that Diamonds Are Bad, at least if people died in order for them to make it to us. As soon as the movie came out, various diamond companies announced they were upstanding companies who'd never, ever do anything like this. I don't know what I should believe, because I've always sort of thought that buying shiny rocks was a dumb thing to do, anyway. But overall, the impression one gets is that this is just another dumb Hollywood message/action movie. A lot of the time, the scenes are basically people running from one explosion to another; luckily, the fine acting of Hounsou allows the audience to track what's going on rather effectively. And of course, in the end Things Are Solved, as I'm sure they are in real life."

She and Danny are supposed to have some kind of attraction; but instead of having sex, kissing, or even flirting, they just bicker about the state of post-colonial Africa, and she keeps preaching at him about the diamond trade, his profession and his cynicism.<br/><br/>Director Ed Zwick has made other sermon-films such as ""Glory"" and ""The Last Samurai"". ""Glory"" succeeded because it was a true story. ""The Last Samurai"" succeeded because the anti-imperialist message fit neatly within the plot and didn't seem forced. In ""Blood Diamond"", I can even imagine Bono thinking ""enough already"" during one of Stephen Collins' or Jennifer Connelly's monologues.<br/><br/>As to DiCaprio's and Honsou's Oscar nominations: DiCaprio was deserving this year, but for ""The Departed"", not this film. In this one, he completely hams it up, especially toward the end. I can only imagine the Academy was impressed by the fact that not once does he slip into an American accent, and that he has finally figured out how to trim his beard so it's not dorky-looking. Why Honsou was nominated remains a mystery to me. He is a fine actor and has had far superior roles in the past; but he was nominated for them, so this is hardly a case of the Academy trying to right past wrongs. In this film--I kid you not--he shouts, goes bug-eyed and drools during the action sequences.<br/><br/>Africa's problems are a fascinating and worthy subject for Hollywood to deal with, especially since the rest of the world has cast a blind eye for far too long. But ""Blood Diamond"" will not change anyone's minds or alter their buying habits. Instead of being like ""Three Kings""--which refused to be predictable in combining Hollywood action and a socially conscious message--it is more like ""The Day After Tomorrow""--which used the worst Hollywood action clichés in an unsuccessful attempt to try and preach at us. 5 out of 10"

","I was able to see a sneak preview of the film tonight ahead of the film's wide release next weekend. In short, it was worth braving the (large) crowd for a chance to get an early glimpse of the film.<br/><br/>As the title suggests, the film focuses on the seedy world of conflict diamonds, and how lead character Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) fits into the illicit trade that's involved. However, the film also touches heavily on other themes, including the issue of child soldiers and the unrest facing Sierra Leone during the late 1990's.<br/><br/>As with many Edward Zwick films (Glory, Legends of the Fall, The Last Samurai) - the film is relatively lengthy. We are initially introduced to the character Solomon (well played by Djimon Hounsou) and how a simple fisherman, and his family, was swept into the rebel/government conflict in Sierra Leone. Without giving away too much, Solomon's separation with his son and the rest of his family plays a big role into the film.<br/><br/>Separately, Archer is introduced as a lone wolf/soldier of fortune type that is captured by local authorities for smuggling. As the movie progresses, both men meet under unique circumstances and essentially rely on each other to accomplish their ultimate goals.<br/><br/>Overall, the pacing of the film is relatively quick, and offers a sobering view of the underground diamond trade without appearing too preachy. The violence is very graphic, and at times, the images of chaos in Sierre Leone reminded me of the gritty scenes in Black Hawk Down. I was glad to see that Zwick avoided some of the cheesiness that he employed in The Last Samurai (i.e. hefty moral/cultural debates that came off as being more superficial than relevant) ... and let the situations that faced the characters speak volumes.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Djimon Hounsou showed once again why he is a great up-and-comer, and was to me, the real star of the film. His stints in films such as Gladiator and The Island provided much needed depth and substance to the lead characters in those films, and once again he's done it again. His acting and emotions spoke volumes about the tragedies that face the African continent, and at times, it's almost his emotions alone that carry the movie. His stoic patience in the face of losing his family and dignity was why he was the most sympathetic character in the film.<br/><br/>On the other hand, even though some have criticized DiCaprio's weak South African/Boer accent, I actually found that to be little of a distraction. I've always felt that DiCaprio was at his best when he's playing the underdog, or lone wolf/vagabond role (see Titanic, Gangs of New York) and in this case, he demonstrated why he's one of Hollywood's most versatile actors. Throughout the movie, he was good a playing a character that was hard to read...one that you never knew what his true motivations were. In that sense, you never knew if Archer was going to betray Solomon, and that created another layer of drama in the film. It wasn't so obvious, as say it was in other Zwick films, and the relationships between two protagonists.<br/><br/>I find that movies which raise awareness about key issues are a very important part of Hollywood. This was one of them. Some of the brutality and inhumanity that was portrayed in the film really hit home. Given the relative quality of most films these days, I was satisfied to watch a film that left me thinking, way after the credits ended. For that reason, I strongly recommend this movie."

","I just watched a sneak preview of the film and I must say I was impressed with the cast but something was missing. It was like the film didn't know what it wanted to be..it would have intense, long, action sequences and then intense,long, dialogue amongst the characters. At one point you kind of forget what they are looking for. And Jennifer Connelly is one of the most beautiful actresses to ever grace the screen. It was like she was too beautiful for this movie. She didn't fit in with the ugliness of the scenario.

It starts out very serenely then smacks you in the face with the violence of the region. Little kids mowing down whole villages. Point blank shots to heads and chests, and backs. The message of the film should not be lost on anyone, and you get a good action flick mixed in. Leo's accent isn't as bad as you think from the trailers. And is actually very good, and unwavering. Jennifer Connelly, Maddy Bowen, was more fleshed out than I was reading about. And the relationship forged between her and Danny is much needed for the progression of his character."

","Against the backdrop of the civil war in Sierra Leone, a soldier of fortune and a fisherman try to retrieve a rare diamond that the latter has buried. The ravages of war are effectively conveyed but it takes a while for a narrative to emerge from all that chaos. And the narrative is less than compelling due to a weak script and undeveloped characters. Although they find time to espouse philosophy in breaks between frequent gun battles, the characters remain one-dimensional. The film is meant to be emotionally gripping but is tedious instead. DiCaprio sports a goofy accent. Connelly proves the camera is mightier than the sword. Hounsou looks intense. Zwich favors melodramatics."
"Boyo-2","10","2","5","8 December 2006"," ""Diamond"" in the rough
","The second-best Leonardo DiCaprio movie in which the search for a diamond drives the plot, ""Blood Diamond"" should not be written off as an 'old-fashioned adventure movie', or, for that matter, just another Leonardo DiCaprio movie..although, in all honesty, if it starred anyone else, I probably would not have seen it this morning.<br/><br/>Leo plays Danny Archer, diamond smuggler and part-time jerk. He lands in prison for smuggling and overhears an accusation that Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) has unearthed a pink diamond so huge it could accommodate a hockey team (preferably the New Jersey Devils) skating on it. Danny arranges for Solomon to get bailed out and strikes up a deal with him - Danny gets the rock, Solomon gets his family back (they'd been taken hostage earlier) and that's how the two start their reluctant relationship. Meanwhile Danny has struck up a another friendship with Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), who wants the truth behind the civil wars ravaging the country; she knows the international diamond trade is behind it and she also knows Danny is involved with that. She needs facts to write the story that has to be written in order to shine a light on this tragedy, all the whole acknowledging that ""Americans might see sixty seconds of this between sports and the weather on CNN."" None of the plot is far-fetched, unfortunately, and none of the action, either, most unfortunately. There is a huge body count of innocent people, women and children included, and children are additionally seen being recruited to join the rebels, so it makes the movie less than enjoyable, if you're just looking for escapism. I found it very well done and painfully realistic. If you have even the slightest bit of conscience in your head, you will be effected by the movie. You might not run home and throw all your jewelry in the garbage, but as the movie suggests, you might want to inquire before your next purchase.<br/><br/>The three leads are all terrific. Leonardo is incapable of delivering a bad performance. Here he is as good as he's ever been. If he's not, the movie fails, and he also wisely realizes that he's not the emotional centerpiece of the movie. He allows Hounsou to occupy that space. Djimon is one of those actors whose soul is apparent on the screen and he can and does communicate without saying anything - my favorite type of actor. Connelly is not just 'the girl' or just around to look pretty - she has a lot to offer on screen and also never phones it in.<br/><br/>In the useless trivia department - all three have co-starred with Russell Crowe - Leo in ""The Quick and the Dead"", Djimon in ""Gladiator"" and Connelly in ""A Beautiful Mind"", and Djimon just won the National Board of Review Best Supporting Actor award, which Leo won for ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape."" As I mentioned, I respect the movie and am glad that it got made as it may change some grievous wrongs that have occurred, but with so much killing and violence, its impossible for me to say I 'like' it, although that does not mean that I 'dislike' it either. Its a helluva journey, with all that that entails. 10/10."
"editor-299","8","2","5","2 December 2006"," Action thriller with a heart
","While the inclusion of heart throb, Leonardo DiCaprio, may attract a few teenage girls to Warners' ""Blood Diamond,"" this is by no means an insignificant or shallow film. <br/><br/>DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a native of Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) who smuggles diamonds out of Seirra Leone (where there is a civil war) into Liberia (where there is not); from there the gems are exported to various parts of the world. <br/><br/>These are called ""conflict"" or ""blood"" diamonds, because of the violent way in which they are obtained. One example of this violence is what happens to Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou, ""Amastad""), whose village is overrun by rebels. <br/><br/>His family escapes, but he is captured and put to work in a diamond camp. There he discovers a huge gem worth a fortune. He hides it, but is spotted by a cruel militia leader; but government troops attack and keep both from the precious stone. <br/><br/>In prison, Archer finds out about the diamond, and in exchange for tracking down Vandy's family, the men team up to go back and dig up the stone. <br/><br/>This leads to a series of exciting escapes and brushes with both government soldiers and rebel militia, as well as an introduction to American journalist, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connolly, ""A Beautiful Mind""), who helps in many of these escapades. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Vandy's only son is being cruelly indoctrinated into the rebel cause and against his family; while DiCaprio is being pursued by South African soldiers of fortune, led by the Colonel (Arnold Vosloo, who played High Priest Imhotep in ""The Mummy"").<br/><br/>I don't know about year-end awards, but I would be very, very surprised if DiCaprio (whose South African accent grows on you, unlike Rob Morrow's annoying Boston drawl in ""Quiz Show"") and Hounsou did not earn Academy Award nominations. <br/><br/>There may be another few nods for Connolly, director Edward Zwick (who should have been at least nominated for ""Glory"" in 1989) and maybe even best picture. The story has a heart, the action is exhilarating and the acting top notch; truly one of the best films of 2006."

","I cringed of embarrassment for the sometimes awful performance by Dicaprio and Connelly. Archer is not a role for Dicaprio who never never appears convincing... it needed more ruggedness and maturity. Dicaprio always looks like he just walked out of a beauty parlor where he got his nails done. Dicaprio is an obviously intelligent, slender man with boyish looks... he shinned in Titanic and Catch me if you can, where the charm and sensitivity of his being comes through with honesty. But tough South African diamond smuggler and killer... no way. This movie could of done without the sappy romance.... which usually ruins any decent adventure film. The photography is stale and outdated. This is Africa... stunning valleys, immense rivers and water falls... nothing of that here. On the plus side, Djimon Hounsou is quite good and the movie is informative on the subject of these boy soldiers and the diamond industry (which is a complete sham by the way). The best performance comes from the band of rebels. The kids are frightening. That's really well done. I wanted to vomit when the final scene rolled on.... a standing ovation??

"goldangl95","6","2","6","16 December 2006"," Touching but not memorable
","I was apprehensive about this movie considering the ambivalent critic response and the huge outpouring of African tragedies that have come out in the last year (The Constant Gardner, The Last King of Scotland etc.) My reaction after was: Alright...could have waited until DVD.<br/><br/>The story is about the illicit diamond trade in Sierra Leone. Blood Diamond's strong point is showing a beautiful country (sadly, not actually filmed in Sierra Leone) torn apart by a horrific civil war. Neither the rebels nor the government are portrayed in a favorable light, and the characters are just trying to survive in the crossfire.<br/><br/>Portraying an African-born white diamond trader, Leonardo DiCaprio does a credible job with a believable accent. However, every once in awhile he became ""Leo"" instead of Archer (I didn't feel that way about him in the Departed). Hounsou is compelling as a fisherman trying to find his son.<br/><br/>The romance between Connelly and DiCaprio seems to have been heavily edited out or should never have been there in the first place. Their story works better as strangers using each other and eventually coming to an uneasy understanding. Not a deeply felt love/attachment.<br/><br/>In the second half, the movie focuses on the characters and their goals instead of the civil war at large. At this point, I was tempted to check my cellphone for the time. While the movie was compelling depicting the actual events of the civil war, I never really cared about the fates of the individual characters. <br/><br/>I believe its valuable and necessary to learn about Sierra Leone's recent civil war.

While the theme of the story was interesting and the screen play generally well-written, some of character interactions came off as slightly clichéd.

The character he creates is definitely my favourite character of his so far, with an honourable mention to Howard Hughes, the part he again portrayed superbly in The Aviator. Anyway, DiCaprio elevates this movie from a routine action piece to a really interesting character driven story. However, whilst I found his character fascinating I did not care to much for Djimon Hounsou character of Solomon Vandy. In fact, I felt the character was overplayed and somewhat corny. Also, the main storyline of the film is about archer and Vandy etc trying to rescue Vandy's son from the grasps of an evil dictator. However, all becomes a little far fetched and contrived at this point as his good natured son seemingly gets turned into a killer within a space of less than week. <br/><br/>So, to conclude I love this film because of Leonardo DiCaprio character Danny Archer, but as well as that the film does feature some great dialogue, some terrific action sequences and also some beautiful shots of South Africa.

It just makes me feel the Earth is so amazing. The scenes also impress me a lot, there is a lot of sound effect like gun shooting, incidental music etc. Music makes the film more convulsed and give a good effect.

","Film Review Blood Diamond The story happened in Sierra Leone in 1990, an unpeaceful place where civil war was happening and people living in horror and fear. Solomon Vandy was one of the victims, who used to have a lovely family, but was forced to be a diamond miner after being kidnapped by the rebel. However, a pink diamond he found changed his density. A mercenary smuggler Danny Archer made agreement with Solomon to get that precious diamond in exchange of Solomon family's position. They began the journey with an America journalist Maddy Bowen and built up a praiseworthy friendship.<br/><br/>The film, doubtlessly, is very touching and meaningful. It may be impenetrable for us of what was happening in the film, but it makes an impact on me and I truly believe the story. I love the character of Danny Archer, acted by Leonardo DiCaprio, who always reflects on his life, his density, and his ideal future. It brings some message to everyone, that we should have a clear target to our future, and try our very best to attach. The smiling face on Archer shows that he had no regret on his life. The varicolored world nowadays made us forget the hardness people had paid behind. Please treasure what you have, and do all we can to have our meaningful live."

"allanahj","9","1","2","2 August 2010"," Very thought provoking movie
","Overall I thought this movie was excellent.<br/><br/>Flicking through the channels one night I came across Blood Diamond and thought I would give it a watch, half expecting some Hollywood take on Africa.<br/><br/>What I found was a thought provoking, emotionally moving movie that felt more African than Hollywood. I have read a fair bit about conflicts in Africa and as far as I can tell the movie was in no way over the top or sensationalist at all. Conflict is widespread across many countries in central Africa and this movie combines all of these elements in all their horror - massacres, forced child soldiers, mass displacement of refugees, corruption, dodgy western arms dealing and corporate greed which fuels the conflict. Indeed the movie avoided some elements which characterise the conflict - for instance no one of the fishermans family actually died, and you didn't see anyone actually raped which was widespread in Sierra Leone during the conflict as in other countries such as the Congo.<br/><br/>I thought both Leonardo and the fisherman were excellent, and as far as I could tell Leo did a very good accent and that is a challenging one to pull off.<br/><br/>The let down in the movie was Jennifer Connelly - its true that she didn't have much to work with but her character was frankly annoying. She came off like so many American tourists overseas who wander into situations they have no real comprehension of and start trying to solve the world in a very preachy manner. I didn't buy the romance between her and Leo (what would attract him to her? She's way too naive and the way she dangles herself in front of him like a carrot in exchange for info is rather irritating). It was fortunate they didn't actually sleep together as that would have been terribly clichéd.<br/><br/>That aside I was so pleased to find this movie after viewing so much sentimental, formulaic American rubbish of late. This movie was intelligent, educational and well worth watching. I don't own any diamonds myself and now am pretty much resolved never to touch one of those again, given that they reek of other people's suffering."

"tburke85","10","1","2","9 May 2009"," Blood Diamond An Excellent Film
","Blood Diamond is an excellent film with a compelling story, plenty of action, drama, suspense, and character development. The movie breezes by even with a running time of 143 minutes. Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific as Danny Archer a South African ex-soldier turned smuggler. DiCaprio has really established himself as one of the best actors in Hollywood today with films like The Avaitor, Gangs Of New York, Catch Me If You Can, Titanic, and The Departed to name a few and he continues to show that in Blood Diamond. Equally impressive are Jennifer Connelly as Maddie Bowen a dedicated journalist and possible love interest and Djimon Honsou as Solomon Vandy a Mende fisherman who finds a rare pink diamond that could help him get back his family. At first Archer uses Solomon in order to get the diamond so that he can payback his employer for a deal that went bad earlier on in the film but a bond eventually grows between the two men that becomes an admiring friendship. All the supporting actors are good in the small roles including Arnold Vosloo and Michael Sheen. The director Edward Zwick does an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen which couldn't have been an easy task. If you're looking for an entertaining film to watch then Blood Diamond is the movie for you. It has it all action, drama, suspense, thrills, adventure, some humor and a little romance that make for an enjoyable film to watch."
"moviesleuth2","10","1","2","14 January 2009"," A Perfect Movie
","""Blood Diamond"" works in the two most lucrative ways: both as a powerful film that the Oscars love, and a summer action/adventure film. It is both of these at the same time for its nearly two-and-a-half hour running length. Despite its length, it is always fully engaging and NEVER boring.<br/><br/>The best way to classify this movie is as an epic, though not in the same sense as say, ""Braveheart"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia."" It has wide epic scale, fully realized characters, a thoroughly compelling plot and thrilling action. I don't think there is a person alive who wouldn't find something to appreciate in ""Blood Diamond.""<br/><br/>1999. Sierra Leone is in the midst of a brutal civil war. Both the government and the rebel RUF are battling for the control of the diamond trade. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) has found a giant, priceless diamond, and just before he is captured, he hides it. A smuggler named Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) finds out about it, and promises to help him find his son if Vandy shows him where he hid it. Along for the ride is journalist Maddie Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), who also wants to write the story of how one company makes money off the war.<br/><br/>The film features two brilliant performances. Leonardo DiCaprio has long since left his ""Titanic""-era heartthrob days behind him, and continues to impress as a serious thespian. This is his best performance yet. Danny Archer is a familiar character, but DiCaprio does enough with him to make him unique. He doesn't like having to help Solomon, but he knows he doesn't have much choice. The same goes for Maddie Bowen, as he is reluctant to give her information, but he has to in order to use the resources that she has. Matching him is Djimon Hounsou, who continues to astound with his mostly unrecognized acting abilities. Solomon Vandy is a desperate man, but he will not let someone push him around, even if they are pointing a gun in his face. To him, the diamond is nothing. All that matters is getting his family back. Hounsou uses his capacity for power and strength to portray a man who is so desperate that he becomes fearless. Jennifer Connelly may have a less showy role, but she does enough with it that it avoids becoming a cliché.<br/><br/>This is clearly a movie for Edward Zwick. He's no stranger to this kind of film, and he knows exactly what to do with it. He treats the material with respect, and gets his point across, but he knows that people go to the movies to be entertained, and he balances that perfectly. ""Blood Diamond"" has a lot to say, but Zwick keeps things movie at a brisk pace. This is his best film yet, and I am eager to see what the future has in store for him.<br/><br/>Typically, musical scores are a small part of a film, but nevertheless a film wouldn't be the same without them (or in some cases, with them). Here, the score plays a big part in the film's success. It's not that its noticeable, or anything special (you're not likely to come out humming its main theme, if it even has one). But it perfectly sets to tone. Without the viewer really noticing it, the music changes the film's tone from something serious and hard-hitting to something more alive and adventurous. James Newton Howard's score is brilliant in how it accomplishes this, because if the film had a different score, it would feel a lot different.<br/><br/>""Blood Diamond"" is the perfect movie. Sure, a lot of the stuff is familiar, but there's a lot of new stuff as well, and the filmmakers and actors do enough to make it all seem fresh. This is one of the best films of 2006, and one of my all-time favorites."

","like the previous comment, i would like to say that i thought Blood Diamond was a great movies and one of the best I've ever seen. You do learn heaps about the wars in Africa and what is a little disturbing is the child soldiers but if you don't mind the violence, swearing and 'disturbing material' then you would love this movie. it has a bit of everything: romance, comedy, violence - and most importantly a not all happy ending. With regards to the ending, I think it was good that the fisherman and his son were reunited and everything turned out happy for them but I also think that Danny Archer dying was good in a way - like sure we would have liked him to go on smuggling diamonds but be realistic - he was a bad guy! And that was the interesting thing about this move - the main character (Danny Archer - played by Leonardo Di'Caprio) was the bad character. A great movie but the only criticism I would have for it is that it was too short for my liking and I would have liked to hear some of the speech the black fisherman made at the end. Great movie - 9 out of 10."

","This will make you think about that big shiny rock on your finger. This reminded me of Tears of the Sun. It was set in the same place and had a similar feel to it. So if you liked Tears of the Sun then you might like this.<br/><br/>Great acting. A very surprising performance from Leonardo DiCaprio. He hasn't won as many awards as he should have. Something that might annoy some people is he accent in this movie. I liked it but some might not. Djimon Hounsou,who is one of the most underrated actors in movies today brought a intense and powerful performance. Jennifer Connelly was not bad but not good. It felt like she was there so it wasn't a total sausage fest. Kagiso Kuypers played Dia Vandy(Hounsou's son in the film)who was IMO the best performance in this movie. He has only been in one movie and he was excellent.<br/><br/>As i said before. It is like Tears of the Sun. Now i am not comparing the two(well maybe i am) but i have to say that Blood Diamond is better then Tears of the Sun.<br/><br/>This is one for you to see. It was great. I recommend.<br/><br/>8/10"
"The_Void","8","1","2","27 January 2008"," Perfectly pitched, well executed action adventure flick with a point
","I wasn't overly enthused at the prospect of seeing this film upon it's release in late 2006, mostly owing to the fact that the previous two Edward Zwick films I saw (Glory, The Last Samurai) were rubbish; but to my greatest surprise, Blood Diamond is an excellent film. The film is about 'conflict diamonds' and the effects they have on the African countries that produce them. This provides the backbone of the film, but there is much more to it than that as aside from the main theme; the film is also an action thriller, a character study and a very entertaining adventure film. The plot focuses on Solomon Vandy; a man whose village is attacked by rebels and his son taken. He is forced to work in the diamond mines. One day, while mining diamonds, he comes across a huge and priceless pink diamond, and promptly hides it. After finding himself in jail, a conversation between him and the slave master is overheard by Danny Archer; a Zimbabwean diamond smuggler who convinces Solomon to take him to where the diamond is hidden...<br/><br/>This film is bolstered by two excellent central performances courtesy of Djimon Hounsou and Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio was seen earlier in 2006 in Scorsese's excellent 'The Departed', and here the great actor is just as good, in spite of the silly African accent. Djimon Hounsou is the real standout, however, as the unfortunate African man who finds the diamond; the French-African actor fits into his role excellently and constantly convinces that he is the character he is portraying. The two men are joined by Jennifer Connelly who impresses also with her limited screen time. The film takes place in war-torn Africa and Edward Zwick manages to get across the danger of the continent really well, and many of the locations are beautiful to look at. I have to say that the 'conflict diamond' theme of the movie doesn't really concern me much; but the reason this film works has nothing to do with what it's about but rather the way it works. Zwick has really succeeded here in making a film with a point that has enough about it to entertain audience members who don't really care. There's a constant stream of action and the characters are fleshed out enough to ensure that we care about them. The film lasts for over two hours but it really flies by. It boils down to a satisfying conclusion and this undeniably one of the best films of 2006."
"hall895","7","1","2","26 October 2007"," Often bleak but certainly compelling
","With its brutally honest look at the harsh realities of life in war-torn Sierra Leone, Blood Diamond can at times be a hard movie to sit through. But there is no denying the fact that the story told here is very powerful and compelling. With atrocities occurring all around this film certainly has its share of painful, depressing moments. But the story is so good, and that story is performed so well by a fine cast, that the film is well worth your while.<br/><br/>The film is set in 1999, when Sierra Leone was in the midst of a brutal civil war. In the midst of this war, the big business of illegally exporting diamonds out of the war zone carries on. Our story here mainly focuses on two men caught up in this illicit, and often deadly, business. Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a loving husband and father living a relatively simple, peaceful life as a fisherman. That peaceful life is shattered when rebels come to his village, take his family away and put him to work searching for diamonds. The other key character, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is Danny Archer, a ""soldier of fortune"" as he describes himself who makes his living smuggling diamonds out of Africa. These two men's paths will cross in jail, Archer there after one of his smuggling efforts goes awry, Solomon having been rounded up in a government raid on the rebels' diamond mining operation. While in jail, Archer learns that Solomon has a secret. Just before being hauled off to jail Solomon had found, and proceeded to bury, a huge diamond of immense value. When the two men are released form jail, they form an uneasy alliance. Solomon will lead Archer to the diamond, Archer will help Solomon find his family. These mens' respective quests, and their very different motivations, will drive the film.<br/><br/>While the story certainly is a strong one the film does tend to drag at times. A few scenes left on the cutting room floor probably would have helped matters. There are some ""action"" moments sprinkled throughout but it's certainly not an action film. It's well-done compelling human drama. Hounsou is terrific in his role, brilliantly bringing the strong, powerful, determined Solomon to life. DiCaprio is also very good, although in a minor quibble, he never does seem entirely comfortable with the accent. Jennifer Connelly has a smaller role as one of those idealistic investigative reporters who always seem to turn up in movies like this. Her character in many ways is very clichéd but Connelly does a good job with what she has to work with. All in all this film may fall just short of being labeled great but it is certainly very good and well worth seeing."
"treeskier802","10","1","2","1 September 2007"," Gripping and Informative Story With Interesting Characters
","Blood Diamond is a very moving film. The story will grip you from the very first moment and drag you on one intense ride. You want action? You got it. You want romance? Check. You want complex characters and great acting? It's here. You want to learn something about the real illegal diamond trade that exists in Africa? Well, you got it and you'll be wiser to what a diamond really may stand for.<br/><br/>Zwick's direction is superb. He gets the most out of his actors, he chooses the most beautiful and the most ugly locations, and he tells this story in a way that draws you in as if you are in the throes of hypnosis. I thought Leonardo Dicaprio's best performance to date might have been The Departed. Not so. He is just as good, if not better, in Blood Diamond. High marks also go to Djimon Hounsou and youngster Kagiso Kuypers.<br/><br/>And although there is less screen time for the romance between Jennifer Connolly and Dicaprio, it is every bit as intense as the one you witness in Titanic. This movie may make you think twice about buying a diamond. For me, I'll still buy them, but I will have greater appreciation for what they symbolize. Rating 10 of 10 stars."
"tenthousandtattoos","7","1","2","5 August 2007"," In America it's bling-bling...here in Africa it's bling-BANG
","A pervading message that comes across time and again in this film is that in Sierra Leone in 1999, life was very, very cheap. Another message it delivers is the ABSOLUTE TRUTH about diamonds: they are NOT rare. <br/><br/>The film follows Danny Archer (DiCaprio), smuggler and ex-soldier, as he meets Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a fisherman who has recently been separated from his family by the Sierra Leone rebels (The ""RUF""). Together the two men embark on a dangerous trek to a diamond field where Vandy has buried the infamous ""blood diamond"" of the film's title. DiCaprio goes because of the diamond. He wants it. It's his ticket out of Africa. Vandy just wants his family back, but quickly realises he can't do it without Archer's help, leading to a very fragile friendship between the two that is played out with excellent talent by the two male leads.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly plays a journalist, Maddy Bowen, who has come to the thick of things because she's tired of writing stories about the ""victims"" and feels powerless. Along the way she tries to pump Archer for solid info about the diamond smuggling trade, but gets swept up in some feelings for Archer, and in wanting to help Solomon find his wife and kids.<br/><br/>Some Edward Zwick trademarks here: conflicted male protagonist ""anti-hero"", strong female lead (who is not just there to f*ck the male lead), fantastic action movie in historical setting. While not great, the film certainly had a reasonable share of standout moments: - One of the best intro scenes to a main character I've ever seen (to Leo's Archer)...perfectly sets up who Archer is, and what he's about...coolness factor is through the roof.<br/><br/><ul><li>Djimon Hounsou's performance in the jail scene, where he strips naked. Great moment for this character...in fact his whole performance is flawless, he is the character in the film I most admired. The scene with his family, and the final moments with his brainwashed son are incredible and very moving.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crossing the bridge - scene where Archer pretends to be Solomon's prisoner. In this scene, Solomon realises without doubt that Archer is one tough cookie...he takes out the 3 RUF members here in a merciless and controlled way that leaves no doubt in the mind that this guy is a soldier, and will kill without hesitation. Worth buying for this scene alone.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ""RUF""...the scenes where we witness them driving around listening to American ""gangsta-rap"" in overloaded 4x4 utes bristling with weaponry are truly frightening...and we can really get the sense of what it would be like to have to live in a country with these thugs. Also, the scenes where they are training and ""indoctrinating"" their child recruits are truly disturbing. The startlingly quick change in Freetown from a bustling market to a gun battle is also very effective and a truly exciting scene.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The love story - understated, realistic and free of a contrived sex scene, very reminiscent of the love story in Zwick's masterpiece, The Last Samurai.</li></ul><br/><br/>In a nutshell this is a politically-motivated action film. The suspense is real, the characters are engaging, the setting and photography are superb, the score fits the movie well and I guess it's just an exciting movie to watch. I'd watch it again because yes, it is exciting, Africa's history fascinates and terrifies me, and there's enough depth to it to get more out of it with subsequent viewings."
"shadowman123","8","1","2","2 July 2007"," One Leo's best performances
","Blood Diamond was a remarkable film that should of gotten film of the year award after The Departed. NOT that I am saying The Departed was no good I just felt in Blood Diamond we were given true depth into Leo DiCaprio's ability as an actor. Set in the back drop of the Seirra Leone Civil War, Blood Diamond is the story of lust power , money , greed to the highest degree all over a rare pink diamond for which all this madness and chaos is about. There is a lot happening in this film so you do have to watch it carefully and usually that would be a complaint of mine but in this film it was I felt an important part because it is all about the chaos that happens in a nation and how the ones in power will do absolutely everything to make sure that carnage ensues so that they can line their pockets with the blood money. The acting was top notch and I really could go on forever how Leo DiCap stole the show with one of his best performances (he starting to compete with Jhonny Depp now , as he has long shrug of his handsome, pretty boy image in Titanic). Djimou Houston acting was also something special as he plays an innocent man caught up in all this and not to mention Jennifer Connolley as a reporter trying ever so hard to make a difference but frustrated at the lack of international attention and not to mention stand out performance's from Arnold Vosloo and the Rebel United Front leader. The action was fast and non-stop with equal amounts of wit and humour from every angle, my only thing was that apart from its romantic moments which never really hit the spot apart from in one scene because we all know really that everybody is out for them-selves at the end of the day. To sum it I would have to say that Blood Diamond is an experiment with the truth. It shows how far a people with power are willing to stretch to ensure that a nation will tear it-self apart so the customer demands of the likes 50 cents, Snopp Dogg are met but only if they realised the amount of blood spilt for a diamond which shows how cheap life really is worth out there.<br/><br/>BLOOD DIAMOND - 8.8 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>IT WILL COST YOU EVERYTHING !"

What this film was was a movie with a good message that managed to entertain too; which is perhaps the best way you can ever really get a message across anyway. Education while entertaining makes something a lot more memorable. I think the critics in here are being way too harsh. I t was a very good film and extremely well acted. Poking holes in it for the sake of comparing it to docudrama films is missing the point."
"Matt_Layden","8","1","2","7 May 2007"," ""Leo Scores Twice In One Year - One Of The Years Best""
","Archer is a diamond smuggler who is thrown in jail after being caught on a routine smuggle. Solomon is a fisherman who is captured by guerrillas and is forced to mining diamonds. Solomon comes across a rare diamond and decides to hide it. A raid occurs and the 'RUF' and the diamond miners are thrown in jail. This is where Archer and Solomon meet and where the word about the diamond being buried is let loose.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond is the second film to feature Leonardo DiCaprio in the year 2006. The other was 'The Departed' and both films found their way to the Oscars, with Leo's performance in Diamond going up for Best Actor. While I personally believe the stronger performance was in The Departed, Blood Diamond still is an awakening to the viewer and not only send out a message, but entertains its audience at the same time. Not many films can do this, but Diamond executes it very well.<br/><br/>Zwick's previous film was 'The Last Samurai' with Tom Cruise. That film was good, but it left me with an awkward feeling. Everything was good until it's bogus ending, in which Tom Cruise, the one American, is the only person who survives the onslaught at the film's climax. All emotion is basically stripped at the end. With Diamond, Zwick learns from his mistakes in Samurai and is actually able to convey some emotion in this film. With a depressing story being told, Zwick needed actors who were able to translate this emotion, he found them in DiCaprio and Hounsou.<br/><br/>Both actors received critical acclaim for their performances and rightfully so. Hounsou captures the screen with every minute he graces it. Playing a man who is tripped away from his family and then learns his son is captured and turned into a soldier is demanding, but Hounsou depicts everything perfectly, even stealing some scenes away from DiCaprio. DiCaprio scored big with 'The Departed' and here is smacks another one out of the park. Before the film came out all I heard were negative things about him in this film, most people nitpicking on his accent. Truth be told, it's pitch perfect and is consistent all throughout the film. DiCaprio is intense and believable all throughout and deserves his Oscar nomination, even if it is for the wrong film.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond feels like two films, one wants to entertain the audience with it's thrilling action scenes and gun battles galore; while the other feels the need to beat us over the head with the message that we may have blood on our hands. While the film does a fairly good job at balancing the two, at times it's just blatantly obvious that the one outweighs the other. By the way, it's the message and not the action. Through dialogue and actions from the characters might as well just turn to the screen and tell us that ""This is bad"".<br/><br/>Straight from the start you know how real and brutal the film is going to be. It's relentless with it's killings, most notably on the village raid in the opening scenes, tying in with the message that the film is trying to get out there. On a technical aspect the film is beautiful, from the desert grounds to the green forests. The art direction and cinematography are both breathtaking and add to the overall authentic experience this film offers.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond, is a film that delivers what it promises. It delivers its message when it needs to and the action when it needs too, only in a few instances it faults. With great performances and beautifully filmed scenes, it's no surprise that Blood Diamond is one of the years best films. Although it could have been a little shorter, clocking in at 2 hours and 15 minutes. The film tends to drag in the final 20 minutes. I can recommend Blood Diamond, it will most certainly entertain."

Leonardo Di Caprio - oh my god, this guy in his last movies perform just amazing. Whole movie was very tense, very powerful.

Where the ending may bring mild scrutiny, and the accuracy of the political nature of the film may be questioned,....this is still one powerhouse of a movie. Leonardo and Djimons' performances are dead-on. The two bring a power to the film that is only equaled by the fantastic an under-appreciated action sequences. The film is incredibly well-fashioned and the plot flows with grace while never leaving the viewer with any of those 'uncomfortable' lulls in the story or in its action. It gains momentum early and then builds to a fantastic fallout of superb thrills and first-rate performances. I find it hard to believe that a film with such a benign premise(the sale of a valuable conflict diamond) can be so fantastically entertaining.....more entertaining than films that have even more interesting story lines....like say 'Children of Men'....which I find to be a good film...but one that takes a great premise and makes it good....where 'Diamond' takes a basic storyline and executes it to near perfection.....the script, the performances, the action, the sheer entertainment...this is a can't miss in my opinion! If it would have ended on the mountainside....or with the reunion(minus the 'hearing'/'meeting') it would have been a 10....a minor and trivial negative....either way...YOU WON'T BE Disappointed with this selection! 88/100<br/><br/>You'll like this if you liked:The Power of One, Catch a Fire, or Body of Lies."

","This is a movie that tries to be all things to all audiences. Its a conscience tweaker like ""Hotel Rwanda"", an action flick and even has the romantic overtones you'd expect from the casting of Leonardo and Jennifer. It's hard to make all three of those jell into a total success, but Zwick has succeeded as well as can be expected.<br/><br/>First and foremost it is another gut-wrenching history lesson about the blind eye the world turns towards Africa. Well, that might be unfair given they depict a UN camp of over one MILLION refugees and describe it as the 2nd largest in the country. Since the UN is there supporting the effects, rather than causes of the strife, the ""world"" is at least trying to patch up the blowout. I believe this is based in fact. Real Diamond Companies are indicted and real UN resolutions are alluded to.<br/><br/>The action flick head of the movie is fast paced, frightfully bloody and given the ""heroes"" multiple narrow escapes (as in dodging several thousand bullets) is a total stretch of believability. But the show must go on, greed must be explored, fatherly love must be exalted and journalistic integrity satisfied.<br/><br/>The romance is handled well enough, with Jennifer Connelly looking better than ever (and in her case, that is saying a lot!!), Leonardo baring his soul and justifications bit by bit and the seed of a mutual understanding and affection planted.<br/><br/>So, these three elements add up to an rather entertaining, satisfying whole, but not without much time and effort from the viewer. Yes, the Connelly character seemed convenient to carry plot points, and later, our emotions forward. Yes, a change of heart or two takes place for an emotional kick. Yes, good triumphs over most of the evil we are presented with. Welcome to the Hollywood blockbuster version of the world's strife and suffering.<br/><br/>Almost 7 / 10!"

Djimon Hounsou is ridiculously authentic as the farmer from Sierra Leonne. <br/><br/>The plot line...The last 5 minutes of the movie seemed too much like the director was preaching.

","If diamonds really are a girl's best friend, they must be an African's worst nightmare, as Blood Diamond uncovers the filthy truth behind the murky trade business of conflict diamonds. Ed Zwick's new film is an issue movie, dressed up as a rip-roaring action-thriller (or an issuetainment film to all you Sun readers). The issue of conflict diamonds is raised right at the start, as a table full of UN ""peacekeepers"" discusses the problems with how our sparkly necklaces may have, at one time or another, been drenched in crimson at the hands of smugglers.<br/><br/>Our story centres on the family of Soloman Vandy (Honsou), a fisherman from Mende whose village is ravished by an armed mob of diamond smugglers, sealing Vandy into slavery, and kidnapping his son. A South African smuggler by the name of Danny (DiCaprio) is thrown in prison for smuggling, and it is here that he meets Vandy. Learning of Soloman's catch of a massive diamond, he uses him in order to make the sale of a lifetime. Unfortunately, his quest to locate the stone is complicated through both Vandy's son being brainwashed by the RUF mercenaries, and a journalist by the name of Maddy Bowen (Connolly), who they need to take them to the site of the diamond mines.<br/><br/>Despite coming under some criticism for his (actually quite good) African accent, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a refreshingly evil performance as the cold-hearted diamond smuggler Danny Archer. But it is Djimon Honsou, as the man desperate to find his family, and escape the wrath of the RUF, who has the stand out performance. Vandy goes through a whole checklist of emotions, each resonating with the audience with true conviction and power. You can almost taste the sweat and smell the fear from his mannerisms. But perhaps the star of the show is the director, who specialises in making entertaining pictures out of political issues. Blood Diamond strikes a worthy balance between the thrills and the chin-stroking."
"ptb-8","8","1","2","18 February 2007"," A bloody good movie
","What BABEL strives for with 4 contrived tragic intertwined story threads, THE BLOOD DIAMOND hits a bullseye with one excellent and timely topic with a powerful and believable subplot.......and a stellar performance by an ever increasingly admirable Leonardo Di Caprio. Like Matt Damon in THE GOOD SHEPHERD and James Franco in FLYBOYS we see a major young male actor delivering a performance that carries the whole film, elevating it to near classic proportions and allowing for a complete absorption and focus for the astonished viewer. I have high admiration for the massive production undertaking that is clearly on screen allowing for a spectacular and tragic epic drama that bats political home runs right to the viewer's increasing awareness of the horrors and cruelties of Africa. As 'worldly' as BABEL attempts and becomes laboured, preachy and contrived; this film succeeds because it is mounted as a combat political thriller with deep social awareness, family realities and utter sadness of loss of spirit. THE BLOOD DIAMOND is terrifying in every way and clever to allow the viewer to be so well swept up that any 'lessons' of the plot and character come as welcome fascinating insights rather than a shopping list of BABEL misery. Director Edward Zwick who also was behind GLORY in 1989 sees the power in the struggle of injustice and noble races has, to me, now offered a superb tough look at the reality of recent Africa and a consumer issue still valid in 2007."

","Edward Zwick's new film the Blood Diamond is a true piece of cinematic art. Leonardo Dicaprio once again delivers a powerful performance & is without a doubt a tour de force.Playing a South African there was concern about the accent but he has perfected it to such a degree that one can mistake him for an Afrikaner.nobody could've embodied such a complex character better or with more honesty and he gives Danny Archer so much depth.Even with a different accent he never wavers. Both Djimon & Jennifer give fantastic performances and should not be overlooked in any way,Djimon is very emotionally engaging and has a great presence on screen while Jennifer brings a softer side to the tough reporter she portrays giving a quiet but memorable performance.These characters are raw and real and they draw you into their world.add to that locations & outstanding cinematography with its panning shots and fast paced angles used during the action sequences & you have a film that is so gripping it captures its audience like a rabbit in a snare. although the story & the characters are fictitious the issue of conflict-diamonds is very real.this can be seen as the eye-opening film of the year and will hopefully cause us to recognize what corruption occurs when people take advantage of their own struggling countries to ensure their own selfish gain.Zwick has successfully made a heartfelt action drama with emotional depth and which opens us up to the horrors of the civil war of 1999.He brings fact and fiction together beautifully and we feel for both the characters and the situation faced in Sierre Leone.the theme has stirred concern but in my opinion that only makes the film more worthy.It truly deserves Oscar praise in all categories."
"owlglass","8","1","2","7 February 2007"," This is Africa
","I always thought of Leonardo DiCaprio as a bit of a 'twit', as the English say. But I must admit, I believed every second of his portrayal of Danny Archer, the un-PC Rhodesian mercenary. More than I believed any of the other characters, except maybe Arnold Vosloo. In fact, DiCaprio was the character that turned this super-PC movie into something that went beyond that and thereby, and despite its ""I'm Important!""-shouting ending, made it into a 'good' movie.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou were burdened with lines so loaded with 'message' that it was almost cringe-factor-10 material. That they managed it to deliver most of them without me wanting to duck every time one of those lines was coming, is a testament to their skill. But in the end it was DiCaprio's sustained characterizationand accent!that kept it all going.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond, whose best and most enduring lines were those relating to the acronym 'TIA' (This Is Africa), wears the 'important' label like a General wears his decorations. Still, its impact is lost in overkill. The same movie without the message-bits would have been simply superb. And without that hokey ending, of course. Does anybody really believe that this trade is ever going to stop? Does anybody really believe that the true evildoers are the traders, middle-men, corrupt government officials, local potentatesand not the ultimate buyers themselves: the people of small minds and/or stupid vanities? For the majority of these diamonds do not go to the rich and powerful, but to those who flood into the local cheap-special-offer jewelry store when the occasions for buying arise or are fabricated by the peddlers of the goods. Without customers there are no middle-men and peddlers turn their attention to something people will buy instead.<br/><br/>Apart from all that, let's look at another messages of this movie. One of them was that about the child-soldiers in Africa, and everywhere else, for that matter. The Hitlerjugend happened in the middle of Europe, rememberand there's nothing new about this anyway. When you need some killers and are running out of grown-ups, the young are the most impressionable and easiest to mold. Even volunteer armies consist mostly of those qualifying as 'young'and for good reasons, one of which is that in their brains one is more likely to find 'impressionability' and a lack of big-picture judgment. I believe the age of cerebral maturity is somewhere around the age of 25. Most soldiers are significantly younger than that.<br/><br/>So, nothing new about child-soldiers, and if anybody thinks that's going to change, think again. The point was that as a 'point' to be made in a movie, Blood Diamond practiced overkill. The same point was made with much more impact and much more to the gut in Tears of The Sun, when one of the team of SEALs, while interfering in some ethnic cleansing in the middle of the jungle, killed one of those in the process of some serious rape and violenceonly to find, to his horror that ""He's just a kid. Just a fg kid!"" The look on the soldier's face as he stared close-up at the face of the dying child-soldier he's just stabbed: that will stay with me forever. Related scenes in Blood Diamond I already have a problem recalling. But what I do remember about it are all scenes involving 'Danny Archer'which tells me something about the caliber of the actor who represented him.<br/><br/>Here we have the difference between bad and good story-telling. But, of course, Tears of the Sun was a flick about US soldiers having a conscience and one with Bruce Willis at that. So it can't possibly have been as 'important' and was probably pure US Navy propaganda. Right? Never mind that it asked more questions per average minute of film than Blood Diamond asked in an hour. It's just that they weren't shoved into your face with a ""Look here! Important stuff coming up!"" Ignoring the gratuitous proselytizing this was a damn good movieand thanks to DiCaprio for making it that way."
"Robert_duder","8","1","2","5 February 2007"," An adventure of great political importance creating iconic characters for film
","Blood Diamond created quite a stir when it was released showing a different side of the diamond industry. It also created a stir with critics and they loved it and now is taking away five Academy Award Nominations which really surprised me. It wasn't that the film wasn't good but it just didn't strike me as anything more spectacular than a run of the mill main stream action film. Sure there was a political underlying message and two really terrific stand out performances by the lead actors but it wasn't overtly artistic or moralistic and had plenty of action, explosions and heroes. Blood Diamond tries to be more than what it is and it might have succeeded considering the critics love it but ultimately it should be taken as nothing more than a run of the mill action film and a good one at that.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio in his Golden Globe and Academy Award nominated role as Diamond thief Danny Archer. There is no doubt that DiCaprio creates another terrific film character in Archer. Archer is truly NOT a hero and yet you do root for him and hope for his redemption in what he does. He is a complex and intriguing character and the question of his redemption is open to interpretation as his final decision only comes from circumstance. Terrific actor Djimon Hounsou also in an Academy Award nominated performance as determined father and husband Solomon Vandy. Vandy is taken into slave labor to mine for diamonds and ends up finding a huge diamond that sends him into a turbulent adventure with Archer who agrees to help Vandy find his family. Vandy is far more the hero of the story and his dedication and love for his family makes him an intriguing opposite to DiCaprio's Archer character. The two of them are an odd teaming and yet they work so well together. Hounsou is perfect in the role. Jennifer Connelly plays reporter Maddy Bowen who becomes involved with Archer in trying to get a story. I have always thought Connelly was a bit of an over rated actor and this is really no exception. Connelly just doesn't seem up to par with DiCaprio or Hounsou and she doesn't fit in with the cast. The romance between her and DiCaprio is forced and unnecessary to the story.<br/><br/>The brilliant cinematography, and setting, all filmed on location throughout South Africa is worth the price of admission alone and then performance by the lead males and much of the supporting cast make Blood Diamond well worth seeing. The story is interesting but I think it's far from politically controversial. Plenty of action, and scenery to keep this a riveting well worth it film but a surprise if it takes home any awards. 8/10"

"shibbyness","8","1","2","2 February 2007"," Africa is burning, and for what reason?
","An abandoned village burns, the vibrant flames lighting the darkness of the night and children and young adults dance to heavy music in and around the flames, firing there weapons into the night as if to celebrate victory.<br/><br/>In recent years, African nations have become fertile ground for Hollywood to exploit(?) for cinematic, and thus financial purposes, in spite of the necessity for film to tell powerful narratives of issues and conflicts still pertinent to the contemporary world. So, although these films, including The Constant Gardener, Blood Diamond, Hotel Rwanda and The Last King of Scotland tell stories simultaneously inspirational, horrific, despicable, shaming, compelling and unique, they also are produced to make profit, and in retrospective analysis, are quite successful in doing so. Blood Diamond is certainly no exception, and ironically, money is one of the predominant themes (among others) of the film.<br/><br/>The story centres around a smuggler, Danny Archer (DiCaprio), a journalist, Maddy Bowen (Connelly) and a fisherman, Solomon Vandy (Hounsou), each with their own motives (freedom, truth and justice respectively). Thus, in both subtle and overt ways, each uses the others for their own benefit, and the benefit of each other. As a result, the three central characters form a framework of trust and dependency, for better or worse.<br/><br/>Of the 'worse' are the events of the African conflict diamond trade, and the rebel force, the RUF. The film does not hold back in this respect, portraying to the audience the despicable acts this force carry out, and many rebel/ militia forces still carry out today, and that is to do with child soldiers. Bringing shame to such an act, we see children being taken from their parents, their families and tribes, and being bribed and manipulated, corrupted, into loyal troops for the rebel force - and thus we also see the horrific acts these children and then carry out, and with such unrelenting glee, and unrelenting loyalty.<br/><br/>The performances are all excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio is indeed a fine actor, although his accent for the first hour of the film seemed to fluctuate between Australian, British, French, and Afrikaans. Jennifer Connelly, as always is excellent (and bears close resemblance to Tea Leoni - in voice and appearance) and the supporting cast is also good. The only actor I'm troubled by is Djimon Hounsou. He is a great actor, which I will not deny at all, however, I found his character in this film to be slightly cliché, as if to say we've scene his character elsewhere many times, and this screen presence also doesn't change. But overall, the performative and emotional intensity from all actors reaches beyond the standard level.<br/><br/>It is here that I would like to digress a little and make some general comments about factual films. While I find that these stories, historical facts, must be brought to screen, and make compelling films, I am equally concerned about the cinematic imperatives that must be considered for the commercial success of the film. For example, in Blood Diamond, it is true that the context and 'A' storyline about the diamond trade and conflict between rebel and government forces occurred. It is also very likely that events that happen in the film to Hounsou's character also occurred to real people. However, the nature of film is to tell narratives, and narratives have a beginning, middle, and end, all of which must conform to an overarching template, and Blood Diamond is no different.<br/><br/>That is to say, the camera has the ability (both intentional and unintentional) to distort reality. That is to say, scenes may be included in the film because they make powerful cinema. This may be by entertaining the audience, or equally by shocking the audience - either way, the audience is responding to the film, and any response to a film, is paramount to not feeling anything. This is a major strength of Blood Diamond and, like Hotel Rwanda and The Constant Gardener, why it is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this conflict was about money. Money from the sale of conflict diamonds, filtered into the market with diamonds mined without conflict. Hence the title 'Blood Diamond' - diamonds traded in the market at the hands of human life. The question the film wants us to ask ourselves, is ""How much blood was spilt for these diamonds to be released in to the market?"" So, returning to the beginning, Africa is indeed burning, and we must ask ourselves, why?"

","While the story is about an actual conflict set in 1999 Sierra Leone, this flick can still be categorized as a well paced action movie. The story itself was quite intriguing, none of the protagonists' behavior seemed tacked on. However, I thought that Leonardo di Caprio was a little miscast for this role, I personally had a hard time to buy his cynical soldier role, probably because this is his first film in which he tries to be a biased, if not bad character. Jennifer Connelly is just great, although she looks a little too glamorous throughout the film, even when she is wearing shabby clothes and khaki trousers.

The finale depicting a conference condemning the Diamond Trade and espousing the merits of ""conflict free"" diamonds is quite frankly an insult to the intelligence of the viewer, and reprises the quite dreadful ""concentration camp motorcade"" addendum to ""Schindlers List"".<br/><br/>Nonetheless this film wins a lot more often than it loses, and neatly interweaves a conventional action movie with a modern morality tale. it scores above average in both genres."

","Hands hacked off to prevent voting. Young children trained to machine gun villagers. Try to fight it or try to survive? Try to fight it by getting rich first?<br/><br/>Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a Rhodesian-born diamond smuggler and ex-mercenary. He ferries ill-gotten gains from 1990s slave mines in Sierra Leone to fences in Liberia. The initial trade is diamonds for guns, but once in Liberia the stones have access to international markets. He meets Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) who has escaped from a slave mine after risking his life hiding an enormous pink diamond. Solomon's son, Dia, went to school every day and dreamed of becoming a doctor - until he was captured by the Revolutionary United Front and brainwashed into becoming a child soldier. For Solomon, recovering the diamond could save his family. For Danny, it could be a ticket out of the cycle of violence in which he has become a willing player.<br/><br/>Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is a journalist trying to expose the bloodshed and misery fuelled by diamonds. For her, Danny is a major potential story source. For Danny, she becomes a useful diplomatic player as they each try to use each other for their own agenda.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond is a taut thriller, but how legitimate is its claim to be a vehicle for human rights?<br/><br/>It made considerable furore. In the week of its British release, both The Economist and The New Statesman - leading influential newspapers - published related articles. DiCaprio was nominated for an Oscar. The US diamond industry announced it would donate $10,000 to African charities for each star raising a diamond-studded hand at the event - a gesture condemned by director Edward Zwick as distasteful.<br/><br/>The film is supported by Amnesty International and also by Global Witness - an organisation highlighting links between environmental exploitation and human rights abuses. Our average audience, in between popcorn and supersized CocaCola, is quite likely to take onboard the message that diamonds should be treated as a pariah like fur. Who wants to be responsible for tying the knot with a gem soaked in blood?<br/><br/>To be fair to the film, it goes to considerable lengths to point out that Sierra Leone is now at peace and that regulation of the industry covers all but a minute fraction of diamonds. This was due to a protocol called 'The Kimberley Process' which now regulates trade in rough diamonds. 99.8% of new diamonds are now from conflict-free sources. This doesn't mean that there are not still millions of dollars of blood money involved in the trade of a few diamonds. Or that slavery and child-militias have been wiped out. But the rhetoric of the movie is designed to make us angry rather than conveying precise information. It has a blockbuster style that spotlights the (excellent) performance of its star Leonardo DiCaprio and makes the villagers the supporting cast rather than the focus. Its target audience may enjoy a feeling of righteous moral outrage, but will they linger to absorb the factual information in the credits or on the official website? Will they ask sensible questions when buying diamonds (such as, ""In which country were they mined?"" ""Were the stones traded under the auspices of the Kimberley Process?"" ""Can I see the guarantees""), or will they simply join the director in his tirade against any industry scapegoat, beneficent or not?<br/><br/>Acting and editing in Blood Diamond are superb. What could have been a very predictable film, keeps us on seat edge throughout its two-hours-plus running time. DiCaprio is amply rewarding the faith that early directors like James Cameron and Woody Allen expressed in him at a time when the public viewed him as just a pretty face. Djimon Hounsou contributes a towering performance. Only the beautiful Jennifer Connelly is woefully miscast. She is at her best in expressing the subtly ambiguous, restrained feelings she develops for DiCaprio's character, but her portrayal of a hardbitten reporter that goes it alone in Afghanistan and darkest Africa comes less easily.<br/><br/>Battles throughout are vicious and realistic. The film does an excellent job of documenting little known areas of human misery and also provides occasional momentary relief with the touching reunions or the re-educating of brainwashed children.<br/><br/>Although Blood Diamond raises worrying human rights issues, careful examination suggests there is more than a hint of jumping on a left-wing bandwagon by the film's producers. It covers important issues but audiences are best researching them independently and understanding both the good and the bad associated with the diamond trade. For instance, diamondfacts.org shows the diamond industry in a much better light than the global witness website, though both seem accurate and factual. Much of the human rights abuses over diamonds since 2003 relate to the abysmal conditions in which diamonds are mined; or the failure of some governments to use diamond wealth to benefit the communities concerned. Liberia is already under UN sanctions. Dealing in conflict diamonds is illegal in the UK. The film barely tackles India, one of the weakest links in the present chain. Worst of all, the unproductive misunderstanding over the industry's donation for 'Oscar waves' was down to the irony that, in Sierra Leone, raising of one's hand to vote used to be a signal for the Revolutionary United Front to chop off hands. One has to ask if the filmmakers' priorities are human rights or the financial success that can ride on the back of making a hullabaloo. <br/><br/>As a thriller, Blood Diamond has a cutting edge; as a protest film, it has as much subtlety as a machete while being careful about offending present day culprits. Finding a diamond story in present day Guinea rather than Sierra Leone might have been more to the point."
"pbartholomew-2","9","1","2","27 January 2007"," Blood Diamond: Leo's gem of an SA accent!
","Finally Hollywood has brought through its ranks someone who can pull off a South African accent without getting laughed of stage.<br/><br/>This has been a point of some concern for South Africans who have seen their lovely accent slaughtered in films like Lethal Weapon 2 and Mission Impossible 2. It seems to always be villains that get lumbered with the task, that and cheesy action sequels. An exception was ""the interpreter"", where Nicole Kidman, wisely stayed away from doing a ""full blown"" rendition and opted for a softer inferred accent. Even so it was still a little crap, and if Nicole Kidman can't pull it off then who can. Remember she kissed Tom ""alien lover"" Cruise with a straight face!.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, South African actors in Hollywood, never get to use their elusive and enigmatic voice in films. Arnold Vosloo was ""the Mummy"" in the ""The Mummy"" and would have been much scarier if he was Afrikaans. Charlize Theron, would have been far more believable as a serial-killer-lesbian, if she spoke like us. <br/><br/>Apparently Leo is the man we were waiting for. Leonardo Dicaprio, is the first to my knowledge that has managed to get the subtle guttural tones without it sounding parodic or just plain silly. He also went one step further to mimic the ""meat eating"" body language of our fair nation. Our hats are off to him and he is welcome back anytime.<br/><br/>Actually while he was here filming, my wife bumped into him at the Diesel shop at the V&A Waterfront, the shop assistants were all in a tizz and dragged up rails from the other diesel shops and closed the doors for a private shopping spree. The pressure!, that's got to be annoying, maybe he was just going in to ask where the toilets were. <br/><br/>used with permission by www.southafricalogue.com"
"polar24","8","1","2","21 January 2007"," Thrilling action meets shocking essential history
","There are so many great films out at this time of the Awards season that I find it difficult to decide which ones to watch and not watch. After noticing that DiCaprio (coming off the back of his fantastic turn in The Departed) was starring, and Zwick (the architect of recent glittering panoramas such as The Last Samurai) directing, I decided to immerse myself in the civil war of Sierra Leone. I was glad that I had as I was swept by the beauty of the country, the exotic jungles and vibrant deserts in the film.<br/><br/>DiCaprio has matured into a fine compelling actor especially since his striking role in the Aviator. In Diamond, his thick South-African accent was just another dimension to the rough, charming, roguish diamond smuggler that serves as our eclectic tour through the fiery Sierra Leone. His performance was charismatic, stunning and heartbreaking. Not to mention he carries the film almost entirely with wonderful help from Connelly and Hounsou. He is at times is dangerous, confident, but tender and I was captivated in his company in war-zone Sierra Leone. Some of the quiet moments in the film where his character is trying to justify his actions and make sense of the world current situation are without a doubt his truly splendid ""money"" moments in acting. His final scene in the film is so poignant and intense - the character truly alluring and remarkable.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly is once again a headstrong, confident and eloquent strong female character. Her ideals and determination force her to expose the corrupt trade of diamond mining and hence the blood yielded for each diamond earned. The chemistry between her and DiCaprio was edgy, clever and well grounded thanks to some tantalizing exchanges from the screenplay. I thought she has never looked more beautiful, articulate and admirable. I think I must have fell in love with her again. <br/><br/>Honsou exuded a quiet intensity throughout. He remains relatively silent for most of the film but when he speaks out under oppression or violence his intensity rages with ferociousness. His tender scenes with his son near the end of the film are also incredibly moving. Not to take anything away from DiCaprio (superbly) playing a South African but Hounson (an African-born) filled the role in every way.<br/><br/>The landscape was beautifully filmed, taking us over fleshy jungles, cocky and rollicking villages, unrepentant deserts and picturesque mountainsides. The Hollywood factor was felt in many scenes with the overpowering use of Newton Howard's score and the money on the formidable sets. But I must be gracious because the sets definitely deserve mention for there complexity, variety and character. Not least the action sequences were fast-paced, sharply photographed and edge-of-my seat suspense. Notably (and thankfully) was the absence of CG effects and explosions which made the experience of being in a war zone even more terrifying.<br/><br/>The commendable and guileless storytelling of the director and producers must also be mentioned. They have brought us a movie that highlights the effects of modern war and civil unrest in our world including the exploitation of people who cannot experience the free will and the quality of life that we take for granted. Myself being for the most part ignorant of these events in our world's history will definitely be learning more about the Africa's bloodshed history and their countries still in desperate need of aid."
"dwpeak","10","1","2","20 January 2007"," Shocking
","Edward Zwick has crafted a wonderful movie. It is a great escape ride, and somehow manages to be a deeply moving human drama, as well as a political thriller. It is hard to determine its genre, and that's one of the many reasons this was one of the best movies of 2006.<br/><br/>Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is an African father who lives in Sierra Leone during 1999. Civil war is everywhere. One day, while walking his son home from school, rebels attack his village. He knows and understands that these rebels are ruthless, and kill without mercy. He tells his son to hide behind a boat. Solomon races to the village to help his wife and other kids escape. However, in the process, Solomon and his son are the ones who are captured. He (Solomon) is sent to dig for conflict diamonds under the strict supervision of the rebel RUF. One day, he finds a large, pink diamond. He understands that this rock could influence his son's freedom. He takes the diamond and hides it. The story eventually makes it to diamond smuggler and former mercenary, Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio). He believes that this diamond, is ""his ticket out"" of Africa. He understands that it must be worth some millions to the diamond industry back in London or the United States. Archer agrees to help Solomon get his son back if he gets the diamond in return. It is also the story of Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), an American reporter who is intrigued by Danny's role in the illegal diamond trade. All three must find a way to come together, or else none of them will get what they want. Or need.<br/><br/>Leondardo DiCaprio has grown so much as an actor. I never thought very highly of him. He was always OK. Then I saw Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed."" As Billy Costigan he blew me away in that masterpiece. Now, he delivers another superb performance. When it comes to Leonardo DiCaprio, I will start looking for his movies more often. He is wonderful here. Some critics have complained of his accent. Why? Many South Africans have said that is is very accurate. They have sounded off in the message board. So have people who have been to South Africa or know those who are from there. The accent is true, and there is nothing annoying about it. I wonder if those who complain about the accent have any association with Africa? Sorry, I got off track. Jennifer Connelly is wonderful here as well, a good actress in a role not based on looks. Djimon Hounsou gives the performance of the movie. He is shockingly emotional and deep. I will be surprised if he does not get an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Charles Leavitt, off of a story by Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell, also deserves and Oscar nomination. It it made up of so many elements, layers, violence, and heart. It is deep. It is wonderful.<br/><br/>Edward Zwick (Glory, The Last Samurai), uses his amazing ability as a director to shoot this artistically crafted picture. This movie is nowhere without him.<br/><br/>Africa has had many horrible things happen in it. I'm not saying other countries haven't, but here Africa is the focus, and to know that some of this is still happening is gut-wrenching. The murder and genocide there never seems to stop. This is a film that wants to tell people there's hope. Hope for a better world. It is a moving film. A lot of what we see is disturbing, but life can be disturbing, and this film doesn't shy away from it. It uses its disturbing content to move you into action. Yes, there has been an act to stop the selling of conflict diamonds in over 40 countries. However, illegal diamonds still make it to the market. This movie will make the most serious diamond-lovers reconsider what they're paying for. Any movie that has the ability to make you rethink and take action, was very well-made. Wonderful.<br/><br/>Danny Archer: Sometimes, I wonder; will God ever forgive us for what we've done to each other?"

This film is unflinchingly graphic (which may seem a bad, in-your-face thing but it is just showing the brutality without any sugar-coating) and incredibly moving. This is helped by some amazing performances, great directing and an intriguing plot. Edward Zwick handles the material quite well and shows us the harsh truth about the diamond mining in Africa during the time of Civil War. All this is helped by great actors. DiCaprio is great in his role as Danny Archer, a white South African diamond smuggler. His accent isn't bad at all considering he only had a month to perfect it. Jennifer Connelly is her usual stunning self as Maddy Bowen, a journalist.

","I really wanted to see this movie but was scared by the drama element ever since I've seen Titanic Leonardo Di-Caprio has left a scar on me, the wound has since healed and Leo has matured on to become one of the finest actors in Hollywood but I'm still scared I'm going to walk into a much hyped movie and come out suffering from 3.5 hours of exposure to drama and romance.<br/><br/>Yet I did see the movie the weekend it released in India and was happy I did.<br/><br/>""This is Africa"" as the actors of the film often repeat is the in fact the central theme of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie explores the ground situation in most war torn countries of Africa and shows us some very interesting and thought inducing facts.<br/><br/>1)That natural resources have indeed on bought about death and destruction to Africa (true from historic times) this is summed up brilliantly by the dialogue in the movie ""Thank good they didn't find oil"" (something middle east will vouch for).<br/><br/>2)That indigenous people in Africa are in fact as responsible for the problems in Africa as the foreigners and instead of organising themselves into helping each other they allow themselves to be manipulated into helplessness, the spate of the people in Africa can again be summed up brilliantly by the dialogue ""....then you'll just be another black man in Africa"".<br/><br/>3)That there is hope and even though they are war torn and death and destruction is part of their everyday lives the people who dare to dream in Africa and and there are others who want to make a difference.<br/><br/>4)The child soldiers (not only in Africa) are the most frightening part of any war torn country children and fragile and when they cross the line they don't just walk but run. Child Soldiers are known to be most brutal of any soldiers and the most heinous war crimes like rape, dismemberment and even cannibalism are mostly carried out by them. Tackling this is going to be the biggest problem, that those trying to restructure such countries face.<br/><br/>5)And my favourite part is how the movie has explored the mixed feelings that the local white people of Africa feel. They are the most interesting part of the movie. Wanting to leave and at the same time struggling with the love for the land they were born and brought up in, are just some of the problems they face, confused about loyalties, racism and to boot it all the funny accents (Leo did a brilliant job here, he sounded just like some of the South African and Zimbabwean cricketers ).<br/><br/>The part about blood diamonds should have been only the the foundation on which the movie was built but was in fact given undue credit in the movie, sensationalists and I believe untrue figures were used to make it look like conflict diamonds were the only cause of Africas Problems and extra-brownie points were earned by putting the onus on the American People (sometimes the I think the Americans like to see themselves as the centre of the world and responsible for everything even death and destruction).<br/><br/>The movie also seems out of date considering that Sierra Leone and many other Diamond Rich African States are now Conflict Free and the hordes of diamonds that had been stored can now be freely sold, yet peace has hardly bought any progress Sierra Leone has the highest infant mortality rate in the world and average lifespan is 38 years.<br/><br/>Yet the movie has put a lot of focus and Africa and Africans and for that it gets huge credit.<br/><br/>Techinically this movie is as good as any movie with this sort of budget and cast should be.<br/><br/>Acting was nearly flawless every actor doing his job perfectly, yet Leo shown above the lot.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography was superb helped by Africas Natural Beauty.<br/><br/>Background sounds, languages and accents showed superb research and were used effectively.<br/><br/>And once again special effects were top notch.<br/><br/>A flaw in the movie is its failure to show the double standards and opposing faces of the life and relief work in Africa, billions are being spent and while many (including relief workers) spend life luxuriously other grovel in poverty.<br/><br/>The only other flaw the movie has (besides its diamond centric viewpoint )is the ending IT WAS WAY TO PREDICTABLE AND QUITE HYPOCRITICAL, there are enough clues in the movie that you are absolutely sure of the ending and it robs its effectiveness. Also the manner in which movie ends clearly shows double standards.<br/><br/>I hate dramas but the brutal life like action and the interesting viewpoints ensure that you are always connected to the movie and the same time you are entertained and excited an extremely rare combination for movies that try to posses any measure of social commentary.<br/><br/>A movie that can be watched and enjoyed by all, even by action/comedy only watcher like me.<br/><br/>THIS MOVIE IS A MUST WATCH.<br/><br/>-s slightly uni-dimensional portrayals and viewpoints, VERY PREDICTABLE ENDING.<br/><br/>+/s romance ???? too universal to be a classic??.<br/><br/>+s technically flawless in all aspects of films, Leonardo Di Caprio, great Africa Centric viewpoint which includes white Africans.<br/><br/>total 8/10 (actually if you factor in expectations and universal appeal it actually a nine but my close friend is one the biggest cutters of diamonds (has never bought uncertified rough) and he assures me that the diamond issue is blown out of proportion (way to shift blame away from arms dealers and relief agencies? )and I trust him enough to give the movie a slightly lower rating)"

"twiceblindsided","7","1","2","12 December 2006"," Worth seeing, but the filmmakers might have missed the mark
","This movie doesn't change your life in epic ways; however, every time you go to the mall, or see an ad for Kay jewelers or even see the diamond ring of a wealthy woman in a restaurant, you will think of this movie. You will wonder whether or not the diamond in the glass case was smuggled across a border, or whether someone was shot for it or not. You will wonder if it was mined by slave labor, digging through muddy rivers while brainwashed AK-47 wielding children watched, anxious to kill somebody.<br/><br/>What should be noted are the performances. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is one of the best of his career and is utterly convincing as a South African (by way of Zimbabwe) mercenary who's seen too much bad in Africa to be anything more than an anti-hero. Djimon Hounsou tries hard not to be the black and white character that the script has written for him, and performs well for what he is given. Of note are his devastating emotional outbursts. His screaming truly portrays anger and vanquish, and its quite powerful.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie, but there was something not quite right about it. The scenes involving ""love interests"" have a cheesy oboe tune playing in the background. The scenes of children killing innocent villagers have poignancy and remind me of the seriousness shown in Black Hawk Down when the little boy shot his father trying to kill Twombly. However, the villains seem pretty one-dimensional, and a lot of the action stinks of special effects and Hollywood exaggeration.<br/><br/>Had the film focused more on the devastating effects of the Diamonds-for-arms trade, this movie could've found itself in Oscar territory. However, it pushed too hard to be an action movie, and the moral of the story was pushed out of focus for too long to really be driven home."

He delivered one of the most moving performances I've seen. The pain and emotion his character shows strikes you and leaves a lasting impression.<br/><br/>Finally while the film does contain some harsh scenes of violence I feel they were needed to tell the story. There is not just violence for shock value, trying to tone down the realities of these African cultures would be doing them a disrespect. You get to realize their struggle and find how small and pointless the problems of America are.<br/><br/>You will not only leave having been entertained with a well developed story but you will also find an appreciation for a beautiful location or more importantly an understanding and harsh realization of the lives these characters are based on."

","first of all, i would like to get a few things out of the way that have been brought up by many of you wanna be critics!.. <br/><br/>There have been people complaining about how leo's accent in the movie is fake..How is one to know what a South African really sounds like.. just like diff parts of the states people have different accents,same as different parts of locations in the uk have different English accents, You cant really be harsh on leo's south African accent.. I think he did a excellent job with the accent and i personally think hes one of the best actors out there in Hollywood..<br/><br/>As for the movie as a whole i think the soundtrack was compatible when played throughout the movie,there was definitely plenty of action, and to top it of, riveting performance from djimon hansou...<br/><br/>this is a movie where it actually gets to you, what people in America are paying for diamonds ,but they don't really wanna take a second to step back and think about whats going on in the world and wheres all this coming from..People in Africa where people are dying just for the sake of diamonds..I also think there was no unnecessary parts in the movie that a lot of you have brought up, it explained the movie pretty well, at least i understood it!..<br/><br/>Story of a mercenary/smuggler trying to find a way out,a farmer's love for his family,and businessmans love for a diamond and to go through extreme measures to have in in there possession..I assure you ,that you will come out at the end of the movie sad but Happy both!..But definitely get Ur moneys worth..id love to sit through it once again!<br/><br/>10/10"

","Having just looked at the numbers for this weekend at the box office, it's a bit saddening to see a popcorn film at the top of the list over an intelligently made action/adventure film of much higher caliber and quality.<br/><br/>I've been waiting for Mr. DiCaprio to pull off something as original as Jack Dawson in the Titanic, and I think that here he's managed to do just that. And now he's got real action hero chops, knocking people around and knocking off the bad guys with a power rifle while dodging bullets and bodies.<br/><br/>In general, it seems, the American public pays virtually no attention to the horrors of Africa, and why should we when we can simply change the channel and not look. Watching the fleeing white Surban with O.J.

Contrary to anything you might hear DiCaprio's accent is flawless, If I didn't know better I'd swear up and down it was real, kudos to him because an African accent is some of the most difficult to master and he somehow manages to pull it off perfectly. Houston's performance as a father fighting to regain is family is enough to move even the most stoic to tears and will not fail to make you count your blessings and be thankful for what you have in the holiday season."

","I have to admit that I am a natural fan of Edward Zwick, particularly with The Last Samurai and Glory. Again, Zwick proves to deliver a very compelling film.<br/><br/>To start off, the film is about an ordinary fisherman named Soloman (Dijmon Houson) who has a perfect family and perfect life in South Africa. It is all disrupted from rebels who raid his village. His family manages to escape (later captured), but he is held captive and is forced to dig in a mine for diamonds. In his time there, he recovers a diamond that he found and hid it away. He is later taken to prison as the mine gets raided by the South African government.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a South Afican weapons and diamond smuggler named Danny Archer (Leo Dicaprio) makes another one of his deals, but is caught red-handed. As fate has it, both men end up in the same prison. Danny soon learns that Solomon has a diamond and wants it. Both settle a deal: Solomon is to give Danny the diamond, and Danny will get Solomon's family back for him.<br/><br/>The two set off on a dangerous and deadly path of finding this diamond with the help of an eager, stubborn journalist (Jennifer Connoly) to get the diamond and reunite Solomon with his family.<br/><br/>Hands down, this is one of the best films I have seen this year! Everything was simply great. Dicrapio has proved himself again as being a decent actor and Dijmon Houson gives an absolutely powerful and believable performance of a struggling father who would do anything to get his family back. Dijmon is simply magnificent and deserves an Oscar for his performance. Jeniffer Connoly was great as well in her role.<br/><br/>The story was griping and easy to grasp. It was highly emotionally driven, particularly with the philosophy talks of modern-day vents about bloodshed and the problems of the world. Also to note, the scenes of brutal violence left me paralyzed. To add about the violence, the director rubs it in your face and is not afraid to show families and children getting blown away by lead, and people getting tortured, giving an authentic atmosphere of the war driven African continent.<br/><br/>The film-making quality captured all of this from the cinematography, use of sound and music, which was all well done. The pace may have been a little slow in a few parts, but the pace is not to be complained about, for I was captivated by this film.<br/><br/>easily **** out of **** Among this year's best films!"

It really opens the eyes of the public, and shows us the corruption, murder, and inequality of Sierra Leone, Africa. The dramatic, cinematic, and literary aspects of this movie are incredible, but I must warn you, it is very violent. However, the violence depicts a message: Don't buy diamonds that have records of being illegally exported.

"LeslieLLKing","1","9","55","12 December 2006"," Blood Diamond - media tip-off -Under a goat's skin it is bloody diamonds (plural)
","Blood Diamond  One Star Time: 1999 Place: Sierra Leone, West Africa Politics: grave civil war and racketeering, including the diamond harvest for the purchase of machine guns to support the civil war. Stars: Leonardo DiCaprio, as Danny Archer, Djimon Hounsou as Solomon Vandy and Jennifer Connelly, as Maddy Bowen Premise: far out, far fetched as in tunnel vision, not strong enough to vigorously and seriously capture any sane person's attention. Solomon, while sifting for diamonds, discovers a rare pink one, and anxiously wraps it in a torn piece of rag, burying it in the earth. Of course, he plans to reclaim it. What makes it so valuable in his eyes? In England, an awaiting jeweler will buy it for a great sum. He and his family will be free, financially and socially. The most thought provoking question arises. What do we place value on and why? For Solomon and Danny Archer, the West African mercenary, riches and dreams bypass the ordinary for extraordinary by means of this pink diamond. Pursuing its capture and trade for money, each believe that there is everything to gain and possibly everything to loose, including their very own lives.<br/><br/>In Robinson Crusoe fashion, this premise plays out. Archer, with determined action pursues the buy out of the mentally scarring and physically taxing practices of diamond racketeering. Solomon, in grave desperation to flee the mass sick persecution, causing great harm to him and his family equates this diamond, just as brilliantly as Archer, a life changing course of passage, to first and foremost, safer land. He and his family are not fighters, maybe naive dreamers, but certainly not people of malice. Tragically, his wife is corralled with others, as prisoner. His young boy, who expressed dreams of being a doctor, is under the spell of the lead guerrilla, a ruthless man, training the boy to kill with a machine gun. <br/><br/>Fairly early in the film, Jennifer Connelly's character is approached by Archer. What single man isn't looking to strike up a conversation with a pretty and striking lady, in a place where only relentless pain and toil persist. She quickly says her name. Mage, Meg, Marge, Maddy? She's an American photo journalist who is set to reveal to Europe, America, if not all of the world, the cruel ways in which diamond traders and buyers work. It's a disgrace, but so is her and her character, residing in such a country portraying this war. To the very end of her West African assignment, she persists to interview West African soldiers, like a high school student collecting trivia and data for the school's weekly paper. All I can think is that Harper's Bazaar is calling you. You are completely in the wrong gig. Don't worry Jennifer. We've all found ourselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. But you volunteered and I wondered why, because you looked so absolutely stupid through out the whole film, and painfully stupid at that. How could this premise give credence to your acting?<br/><br/>My advice  give up on playing yourself as the liberating feminist, as it not only makes feminists look stupid, but translates to simply female idiocy. In your character's end, it comes across a little too Kathy Bates, from ""Misery""  'Mr. Man.' But again, who am I to say? You were only acting  right? Harpers Bazaar  think about it? It just might tell a closer truth, or at the very least, a better fiction! <br/><br/>Question for Leonardo? How would Danny ever literally store a diamond under his tooth and why? That was silly. Also, Leonardo, your goose chase was almost as ridiculous as Jennifer's, with the exception that you are a man, playing in a man's world, an oft times foolish one at that. If you wanted to show such physical prowess to your public or yourself, why didn't you talk to me first? Certainly, if you didn't like what I have already written, I could have designed something more tantalizing and less taxing. Even though your character was Crusoe precarious, you tempted me by all of your earthly wiles and sacrifices. Means by which you through this character dreamily wanted to save your soul, was infinite, not finite. That was impressive, even though the story was not. There was no compromise for you, tragic hero!<br/><br/>If Jennifer can have a Harper's Bazaar spread, why can't you have something that reflects Nemo found, something altruistic, like a bow flex, a lovely, cling to lady, and a resort of your choice for three months? Djimon, do you have an education? It's always continuing anyway. What about a scholarship to an American University? You cleaned up well at the end. It's certainly, not automatic riches, but it's knowledge and understanding, less ignorance and laziness. A son of yours really could become a doctor after all, or a jazz musician. Not bad. As the Chinese say, Happy Christmas!"
"blanbrn","4","2","7","23 March 2007"," A civil war of blood.
","""Blood Diamond"" overall is a movie with a meaning of more than diamond trading or smuggling, but it shows a powerful message of how greed and corruption can cause a nation into a bloody civil war. The performance given in the movie are pretty good from Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly, and Djimon Hounsou and the action and adventure move along to make this a pounding epic. The plot focuses on two different objectives also. DiCaprio is an ex-mercenary turned diamond smuggler who joins up with Hounsou a Mende fisherman during the civil war of 1999 Sierra Leone, both with objectives to recover a diamond, and to rescue the fisherman's son who has became a child solider in a brutal rebel war. Overall this is an OK film not the best though you really have to be into international history to enjoy it well."
"samseescinema","6","2","7","6 December 2006"," Too Distracted by its own Message
","Blood Diamond reviewed by Sam Osborn<br/><br/>Films should be made to tell a story. For me, that's their only function, and it's a function that's beautiful and endless. A message film is a hindered film because it never keeps its eye on the ball. It's like taking a class where your professor is Miss Universe; your attention is directed to the right object, but never for the right reasons. In order for us to believe in a message, we must first believe in the story it has to tell. <br/><br/>The message in Blood Diamond, of course, has something to do with diamonds. The title, a delicious double entendre, refers to the pink hue of the diamond in question, and also to the blood spilled in trying to obtain it. The obtainer is Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a white Zimbabwean diamond smuggler with a South African background. His charge is to hunt the diamonds down, buy them for cheap, and hump them across African state lines to sell them for an illegal profit to Van de Kaap (Marius Weyers), a two-faced diamond retailer mirroring the real-life De Beers. The diamonds involved in this trade are known as conflict diamonds, since the groups that initially profit from the sale are warlords and rebel groups who force slaves to do the requisite mining for them. <br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a father stolen from wife and three kids to work as a diamond miner, sifting rocks from gems in a muddy West African river. He stumbles upon the blood diamond, burying it just before a happenstance government raid puts him in a Freetown jail. Also in this jail is Danny Archer, having been caught smuggling diamonds under the skin of a goat along Sierra Leonean border. When Danny gets word that Solomon knows of the diamond's hiding place, he spins a deal to bail both of them from prison. And because Danny owes a certain Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo) some lost diamonds and Solomon's still missing his family, the two have reason to go diamond-hunting. Jennifer Connelly works her way into the story as Maddy Bowen, the frustrated journalist looking for the inside scoop on the conflict diamond trade.<br/><br/>DiCaprio turns in a satisfyingly ironic performance here, seeming to exploit all the reasons people despised him in the first place. He plays a would-be fraternity brother who seems to have been accidentally born into African violence. He's an overconfident prick with just enough oil-slick charm and big-bulk intensity for us not to hate him. Connelly doesn't have much to work with, granted, but her sympathetic maternal stares at Hounsou could have been laced with more condescension. But then again, maybe not. Hounsou hammers out an affecting role from the little he has to work with. The man is best when screaming and barreling through in a blood-soaked fury, and Director Zwick gives him numerous reasons to do so. <br/><br/>Zwick's direction is lively and strong, giving Blood Diamond a much undeserved umph. But the screenplay devolves its characters into the African sob acts we've seen played out on the Hallmark Channel before: Connelly's American journalist looking to make a difference, DiCaprio's heartless cum last-second humanitarian, and Hounsou's sad African from infomercial land. And as many lines as they can spew on about the ignorance of certain first-world nations and the schmaltzy National Geographic articles cranked out each month, their own uselessness is always underlined by the film's paucity of power. The story turns like clockwork, all mechanical and repeated, because the characters seem always on the verge of looking straight into camera, asking for a tax-deductible donation to save the victims of the conflict diamond trade. <br/><br/>Samuel Osborn"
"sghnmbjb","1","6","35","31 December 2010"," Another movie by the Western civilization to degrade Africa and show how great the West is
","OK before I talk about this Movie let me tell you that the sole and the only reason I saw this whole damn movie was to relate to the pain of Africa and nothing more. I can relate to the pain of Africa because my own country had been ravaged, plundered, raped and its civilization torn to shreds by the same White and Christian people who show pity on us after creating all havoc.<br/><br/>Yes I am from India where the British Empire has destroyed once great civilization......Oh Yeah, some converted Indian christians who recently changed their religions for money will come back to tell me that the British gave us Railways, Post office and most of all their DEMOCRACY......I will say that our civilization was trillion times more advanced that what the British or the west could ever offer us. And I say screw the Railways they gave us.....And definitely screw the democracy they gave us.<br/><br/>Anyway coming back to the subject of discussion, this movie tries to show the current situation in Sierra leone but it is heavily exaggerated in terms of the violence as if Africa was all voilance and America and West and all the ""HOLY NATIONS OF THE VATICAN"" are the seat of Heavens where Christ the savior lives. But it is true that Africa has a lot of violence and there are child soldiers there with guns.<br/><br/>But I want to ask you just one question. Why is there violence in Africa?. Who buys the Diamonds?. Certainly the Africans don't need it....They never went after money or greed and they just want to live happily with their family. It is only the western civilization with its blood thirsty greed who arm the Rebels in various African nations to cause a civil war between their own people and steal all the diamonds.<br/><br/>But I want to say just one more thing. In Hindu philosophy there is a concept of Karma. It means that what you sow so shall you reap. Right now you Western people can make a Hollywood movie and mock at the Africans and laugh as to how they kill each other but one day you shall reap and the same things will happen with you all and 100 times more than what you did.<br/><br/>Finally an African or an Indian will think 10 times to kill his family for money. But I am damn sure that a White man or a Christian man will first kill his family and then take the money.......If you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Thank you."
"christpunchers","3","2","8","15 February 2009"," Another disappointment
","I'll give Blood Diamonds a 3 for the visuals but everything else about this film, from the script, to the ""acting"", to its themes were just plain bad.<br/><br/>Going in, I thought this was going to be a thinking man's movie, but all I got was a young boy (Leo) trying to play a grown up bad boy by growing a face full of beard and putting on a god-knows-what accent (Is it African? Australian? British? Who knows!). Leo is one of the most overrated actors of all time. He was great in Basketball Dairies and Titanic but he CANNOT play a tough guy and certainly not one that needs an accent. Throughout this entire movie, he had one expression on his face for 95% of the time, and that was his ""oh I'm really serious and quite angry"" look. That's NOT acting, there's no range, no emotion, he's just frowning his face and delivering his lines while moving his eyeballs and looking away from the camera for a slight variation so hopefully the audience doesn't get bored.<br/><br/>Then Connelly's character, a ""journalist"", suddenly appears at the right spot and blooms this one dimensional relationship with Leo in a matter of a few hours. The two of them go on a little ""adventure"" in the outback of Africa. First of all, what newspaper/magazine operation would send a woman like that on her own in the middle of a warzone without any restrictions whatsoever and allow her to go anywhere she wishes? Second, was there even a point to her character other than to add cliché romance and tell us that this white woman isn't a bad person but she cares about what she's writing (like it would have went down any other way).<br/><br/>This movie didn't know what it wanted to be. One moment it was comedic, the next it was a drama with some lame-forced romance added in. Suddenly out of nowhere roll into this shaky-cam, 3 seconds per shot-sequence that looks like it was taken out of a Borne movie. It is riddled with one coincidence after another. In one scene Leo's character somehow finds Connelly character after escaping from a warzone in which every civilian including local soldiers all died in. In the next scene, you have the father being locked out of a refugee camp filled with a million people then out of nowhere the family he has desperately searched for magically appears right infront of him. Wow! What are the odds? When our three main ""heroes"" are lost in the woods they somehow end up in the backyard of a friend's house whose sole purpose was to give cliché lines about life, morality, death and righteousness then eventually get shot to give the script some ""dramatic"" effect.<br/><br/>This is nothing more than an Oscar bait with a huge budget and a stinker of a script. Is it really about blood diamonds? No, this ""romance/action"" film could have had any other backdrop and it would have turned out the exact same way. I'm very disappointed by this film. It's the type of movies that come out these days with a lot of hype but absolutely nothing to back up for it. Sure you have starpower with a controversial hot topic but that alone does not make a movie decent. If they only made a movie about AFRICANS and kept it about the BLOOD DIAMONDS then you'd have had a much better film, but of course this is Hollywood, so if the film does not contain big stars with sex appeal the studio wouldn't have okay'ed it."

","This film makes me doubt a lot about this kind of docudrama (which seems to be «en vogue» at Hollywood), I mean about its reason to be done. The acting was completely unconvincing and the script predictable. Just to point a precise moment, the speech of Solomon Vandy to his son in the gun-threat scene was almost ridiculous and it could be great. Also Danny Archer was far from being the «tough guy» deeply troubled by his dark childhood in Africa (I appreciated the irony of stop smoking in the last minutes of the film / before his death: «smoking is dangerous only if you are alive», he used to say). It's a pity that instead of get me worried about what is happening in Africa, the film only get me bored. I would prefer to see instead a straight documentary on National Geographic and it would be memorable."
"jrbmangus","10","1","3","7 February 2011"," Great Movie
","sometimes you walk out of films and forget them easily, but films like Blood Diamond get your mind moving even after its over. first and foremost, this film sheds light on the murderous scandals in Africa which occur over diamonds. It keeps the viewers attention by providing outstanding realism through beautiful locations, mixed with great acting, and creative direction turning Blood Diamond into a must see. The film is one of my favorites and will truly resonate with people who have been to Africa.<br/><br/>Most films that try overly hard to preach a message end up getting bogged down with superficiality, but Blood Diamond keeps its strong message while remaining a highly entertaining flick. I enjoy getting lost in the story or feeling like I'm in one of the scenes which this film accomplishes. The RUF troops ravage the local villages and mercilessly kill hundreds of innocent people. This rebel army brainwashes the male children and turns them into cold blooded killers and reward them with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes afterwords. The film makes the viewer see how lucky they are to not be involved in such civil uncertainty. It also shows people that the country needs help and can't fix these problems alone. The issues certainly set the stage for a dramatic film, but without performances and direction it may have fallen short. <br/><br/>The stars of the film were Leonardo Dicaprio, Djimon Hounsou, and Jennifer Connelly who all deliver outstanding performances. Leonardo Dicaprio looked like a real war veteran with everything from his gunman-ship to his South-African accent. Jennifer Connelly played the pretty American journalist who would do anything for a juicy story, but also showed a deep affection to the issues Africa was facing, her emotion felt very believable. The standout was Djimon Hounsou (Solomon), i mean wow! This guy should be getting more leads if this film was any indication of his body of work. His emotion, believability and commitment were fantastic. There were times his lines would give me shivers up my spine because it felt so real. You can tell the piece meant a lot to him and it shows in his performance. The scene where he strips naked and screams ""WHERE IS THE DIAMOND, you have taken my family, my home, EVERYTHING"", really helps the viewer connect with Solomon. The acting helps the audience really believe this film, and the direction puts everything in place to be a success. <br/><br/>Edward Zwick does a good job at mixing entertainment with an important political message which is no easy feat. Watching this movie as a 21 year old made a huge difference from when i was 16. I connected with the film a lot more and felt the gravity of everything. If you have only seen this film once when you were younger, or for some reason haven't, it is totally worth the 2 hours."

Like many writers faced with a big important subject, Charles Leavitt struggles to find believable (or interesting) characters through which he can tell the tale. Instead, he comes up with a cast that are familiar to us all  the amoral adventurer, ripe for redemption; the crusading journalist (who also just happens to be a gutsy, strong-willed woman), a noble native everyman, a villainous diamond smuggler  all of whom are way too simplistic in their representative roles.<br/><br/>As always, Leonardo Di Caprio delivers an admirable performance, even if he does lay on the 'Saird Efriken' accent a bit thick, although, for my money, he was too convincing in his amoral stage to make his eventual redemption believable. And how heroic is that self-sacrificing redemption? It's always good to see Hollywood straying from its tendency for happy endings, but Danny Archer's decision to die on a hillside rather than try to save himself ('Oi've god a leedle problem 'ere, huh?') really doesn't ring true.<br/><br/>At its surface level the film makes for passable action-adventure entertainment, despite (or maybe because of) the stock characterisation, and is a bit of a throwback to the Hollywood adventures of the 50s. But burden all those explosions and killings with a cumbersome message that comes across as a little too preachy at times and the whole thing gets a little weighed down by its own importance."
"srelan","5","1","3","5 February 2008"," Could have been good movie but ruined
","DiCaprio's role-play was better than I expected, the screenplay was dumbed down cliché as Hollywood usually does with good real-life stories, but it was still good. However, Jennifer Connelly's role (or her acting, I can't tell) was so bad as it ruined the film for me. Her portrayal of an embedded reporter was so unbelievable as to take away from the storyline and DiCaprio's role. She played the cliché moralistic smug reporter that was so far from reality as to be comical. (She should have watched some Iraq video filings from embedded reporters or just about any CNN foreign war correspondent clip to see how neutral and bonded with trust to their subjects they are in real life). The film also made only fleeting reference to the artificial valuing of diamonds by DeBeers yet promoted more blame on U.S. consumers. That illogical fact comparison also stuck out in the film. Couldn't help feeling the whole film as this movie had SO much potential to be better were it not for the mediocre screenplay, shallow storyline, and Connelly totally miscast in that role (or just simply bad acting/direction)."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Danny Archer (Leo Di Caprio) is a South African born diamond smuggler who transports diamonds illegally for a London based firm. Meanwhile Solomon (Djimon Hounsou) is a typical African villager who dreams that his son will grow up to be a doctor, only for a militant band of rebels called the KUF to invade his village, take his son hostage and force him to work fishing diamonds out the rivers. Their paths are about to cross in an explosive way when Solomon is caught by a KUF commander trying to conceal a precious diamond for himself and is thrown into a prison camp. Danny gets him out to work for him but Solomon won't do anything until he's found his son and so begins a desperate and deadly race across Africa for the two men, along with idealistic reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connolly) who wants to expose the corruption going on.<br/><br/>In the leading role, Di Caprio's never been an actor I've really warmed to, as I've always seen him as more of a teen heart-throb rather than a serious actor, but he's making that transition now and roles like this will raise his profile to where he wants to be. His accent was a bit shaky, to be honest, meant to be South African but at times it sounded vaguely cockney and then even Austrailian. Nevertheless, he delivered a fairly commanding performance in the lead role. In the main supporting roles, Hounsou and Connolly are also commendable, if not anything really special.<br/><br/>Performances don't drive the film, the story does, a sprawling, sweeping tale that brings the decadence and evil of the African situation to life, as we see the same problems faced there as they are for black people all over the world, with child soldiers being recruited to serve for militant soldiers, in much the same way as any gang member would do to a kid living in Rio or SC Los Angeles, their young, naive minds being corrupted into thinking they are doing the right thing, made to feel big with a gun and an attitude, and with the same horrid, hollering gangsta rap music blaring all around them. That said, the film also manages some nicer moments, with some great cinematography of wide, luscious African hills, forests and rivers and a genuinely engaging central story of hope and survival. Edward Zwick, whose Legends of the Fall is the main film of his that springs to mind, guides the whole thing along in a manner that's sometimes a bit wavey but nevertheless engaging.<br/><br/>Your attention might wonder a bit sometimes, but overall this is a very rewarding and well made film that was pretty much made for Oscar night. ****"

"MattsMovieReviews","5","1","3","9 April 2007"," ""Blood Diamond"" is an unfortunate disappointment
","""Blood Diamond"" is the story of Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) a fisherman who lives in Sierra Leone where a civil war is being fought between the Government and rebel troops known as the RUF (Revolutionary United Front). When his village is attacked by the rebels, Solomon's family flees as he is abducted and sent to work in the diamond mine fields where the money spent on the precious resource by international companies is used to buy illegal weapons and finance the war. Coming across a large pink diamond, Solomon buries it as government troops attack the mine field throwing all survivors in jail where he comes across Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a former soldier turned diamond smuggler from Zimbabwe. Finding out that Solomon has possession of a diamond that can help him get out of Africa once and for all, Archer makes a deal with Solomon where he will help find his family if he leads him to the diamond. Archer in turn makes comes to an agreement with American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) who will use her resources to help locate Solomon's family in exchange for inside information on who, where and how the illegal diamond trade works. Things however get complicated when Solomon's family is located in a refugee camp minus his son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) who is tortured, drugged and trained to be a child soldier for the RUF leading to a conflict of interest between Solomon and Archer whose main priority is possession of the diamond first and rescuing Dia second. Meanwhile Archer's employee and former commander Colonel Koetzee (Arnold Vosloo) also wants in on the deal. Directed by Edward Zwick (whose previous film ""The Last Samurai"" was one of the best of that year), ""Blood Diamond"" is an unfortunate disappointment which tries to hard to put its message across. The main problem has to do with the fact that I've already seen this film at least half a dozen times before. Corruption, murder and civil war in Africa at the hands of rebels/international companies/governments can make compelling viewing in the hands of the right film maker (""Cry Freedom"", ""Hotel Rwanda"" and ""The Constant Gardener"" are all great examples). Yet ""Blood Diamond"" just does not deliver. It doesn't pull at the heart strings like it should, Solomon's dilemma not scoring in the emotional stakes no matter how hard they try, the action scenes are well shot but seem out of place and the movie runs way to long with an extremely dismal and tacky ending ruining whatever credible it had. However it can be a rather brutal film. The body count is high, the beautiful scenery undone by the brutal savagery of the rebels as the disturbing images of brainwashed children, high on drugs and trained to be killers gun down helpless villages. The movies saving grace comes from Leonardo DiCaprio who gives another career defining performance and, along with his work in ""The Departed"" has won this reviewer over. With a pitch perfect accent, DiCpario plays a man jaded by bitter horrific experience, a classic contradiction as his willingness to do good is undone by his greed. Djimon Honsou is also good with a powerful and emotive display that although is a little over the top at times, his credible presence gives whatever film he appears in a sense of class. Jennifer Connelly's talents unfortunately are wasted, the Oscar winning actress delegated to nothing more than eye candy, although her role may be the most important as the journalist looking for a story big enough to garner the world's attention. And with that comes the question: does ""Blood Diamond"" make a big enough impact to actually change the attitude of a world obsessed with 'bling'? Or is it a case of to little to late to actually make an impact amongst does whose only source of international affairs comes from the cinema's they frequent? The only thing I know for sure is as long as every rap video contains a Bentley with diamond incrusted steering wheels and every gushing new bride drools over her shiny new rock on her finger, than the message is not getting across quick enough."
"mikebrownemail","10","1","3","13 March 2007"," DiCaprio is the next DeNiro!
","DiCaprio makes the movie shine, through and through. He has truly earned his gold star as the next DeNiro of our generation. I watched the movie, completely memorized by his performance and the damn remarkable character he created as the role of Danny. DiCaprio's performances over these past two or three years have inspired me and encouraged me as an actor more than any performance ever has. His work is flawless. And if you think differently, retrace your steps to try to find where you lost your freaking mind. Sometimes as an actor I crave for IN your face, point blank, brilliant acting performances. DiCaprio's performance will make you want to watch it over and over again, because he brings out so much truth into the picture. This character is real. To watch him act is just.... one word spellbinding. He is unstoppable, so get ready for it!"
"Dr_Coulardeau","9","1","3","8 March 2007"," Let's trick the diamond dealers into being humane
","What a rebirth indeed. Di Caprio is finally finding his way to some adult roles. He learned the trade from Scorsese and The Departed. Now he pushes it into some thickening and intensity in this film. He knows how to use his facial expressivity to mean cynicism, hatred, violence, meanness, viciousness, cruelty, etc though not yet the rising physical desire that may accept to condescend to turn into something more intense, even passionate. That's his face, and close-ups are numerous. Yet his body language does not remain that coherent and he still keeps some of his adolescent even pubescent lascivity in some attitudes and movements. He will learn, they say, provided they do not lock him up in roles of villains just the way they had locked him up in roles of smooth-skinned and practically hairless desirable adolescents, in spite of Basketball Diaries where he had quite another potential. So Leonardo Di Caprio is coming of age and may have found a completely new field of artistic expression. Yet the film was expected for a completely different reason. The mythic scandal of our modern world: the wars both for and fed by diamonds in Africa but waged by children soldiers who enrich some weapon dealers and diamond speculators with not only their blood, but also the blood of their parents shed by and with their own hands. The film is poignant because of the presence of several artists, the main black actor of course but also Emmanuel Jal and his music, who were children soldiers themselves. This film is ruthless, systematic, unavoidable in the obvious conclusion that the rich of this world need these wars to become richer. This commitment of an actor like Leonardo Di Caprio to this necessary struggle to make our world more humane, can only help millions of people to understand those wars have to stop, not be stopped by tyrannical foreign military interventions, but by negotiations, economic sanctions and sentences against those who are responsible for these unacceptable feudal if not even more primitive ambitions that can only be fulfilled by the enslavement of millions and the victimization of all those who are not members of the closed clan of power they are part of. It is good Hollywood gets aboard the train to humanistic globalization.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"
"fuzileer","10","1","3","1 February 2007"," An astounding film, a fantastic storyline, a South African with an Australian accent.
","PREDICTION: <br/><br/>When I first agreed with my friends to go and see this film, I was a bit unsure what to think, mainly because Leanardo DiCaprio is in it, and judging by his previous history of rubbish films since Titanic, who could blame me?<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE: <br/><br/>But I almost burst out laughing when I first head DiCaprio's (""Titanic"") first sentence. He was speaking in an Australian voice, even though his character originates from South Africa, how-ever that works... But regardless of the voice, he delivers an astounding performance, only boosted with the (I think best) performance of Djimon Hounsou (""Gladiator""). Sadly, Jennifer Connelly (""Once Upon A Time In America"") does not live up to her average expectations, giving a mildly okay performance as the love interest of DiCaprio. Also starring is the great Arnold Vosloo (""The Mummy"") and the not-so-great Michael Sheen (""The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse"").<br/><br/>BASIC STORYLINE: <br/><br/>Set in the backdrop of the Sierra Leone Civil War, fought between the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the Army, Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a fisherman, is captured by the RUF and taken to work in the Diamond Fields, where he comes across a diamond as big as a pebble. He hides it, but one of the guards - Captain Poison - spots him, before the Fields come under attack. Vandy is captured and taken to prison, where Cpt.Poison is also taken. At this time, Vandy's son is captured by the rebels and is trained to become one of them, a Child Soldier.<br/><br/>In prison, Cpt.Posion starts yelling at Vandy, asking where he hid the diamond, and Danny Archer (DiCaprio) overhears. Once they're both released, he offers to help Vandy find the diamond, and split the rewards 50:50, and Vandy agrees if he helps to find his family.<br/><br/>So the two set off, narrowly avoiding getting shot by the invading RUF. They eventually find his family in a nearby camp for refugees, but is told that Vandy's son, Dia, was captured. They continue, and eventually come across the area where the diamond was hidden. There, Vandy finds Dia, and tries to get him out of the camp, but Dia refuses, as though Vandy is no longer his real father.<br/><br/>Captured, Vandy is about to set off at gun-point to find the diamond for Cpt.Poison, but then, a helicopter attacks the camp and Archer races into the camp to find Dia and Vandy. An amazing scene follows, where there's more explosions and bullet fire than Saving Private Ryan. (Hell, DiCaprio actually looks COOL firing the gun!) Vandy, in a bloody rage kills Cpt.Poison and just when everything seems under control, the army arrives and Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo) forces Vandy to find the diamond or he would shoot his son. <br/><br/>So, Archer, Vandy and Dia walks to the area where the diamond was hidden, with the Cnl. and 2 guards on watch. They rebel and kill the 3 soldiers. Running towards a hill, a helicopter circling above to take them to the safety of England, Archer begins to get exhausted and collapses. Vandy carries him up the hill. (This is where me and my mates began to laugh really loud as it sounded as though DiCaprio was having an orgy... For 5 minutes...) Eventually, Archer tells Vandy to leave him on the hill, revealing that he was shot in the fire-fight between the Cnl. and him. Running towards the helicopter, Archer holds off the Army soldiers giving chase. He watches the helicopter fly off into the distance, a beautiful setting. Then, he slumps where he sits. He is dead.<br/><br/>Vandy gets to London and sells the diamond, for a lot of money and his family's return to England. This happens and he lives happily ever after.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: <br/><br/>In all, it is a great film, even if it may not be true story, it is based on real events that happened. Tens of thousands of people died in the war, and we seem to have forgotten about it. This film is a good reminder, with its great characters and amazing story. 10/10. I could not find a single major flaw in the movie.<br/><br/>A definite must see."
"lmdfrost","8","1","3","31 January 2007"," Leo's ongoing fight with Hollywood!
","Leonardo DiCaprio troubles me. Rarely have I felt as strong an empathy or understanding with an actor! Simply, i think he is truly gifted, a rare and welcome talent in todays 'shout and cry' world of acting. But why, with the utmost respect to all involved in his films, can he not stray from movies laden with Hollywood stereotypes and restrictions. Not since Basketball Diaries have i seen DiCaprio 'let rip', obviously revelling as a young actor in a role packed with freedom and interpretation. And it seems since then DiCaprio has sought out roles which, I feel, prohibit him from true greatness, whatever such a notion is.<br/><br/>I have a great deal of time for Hollywood, and although i feel i enjoy a wide variety of 'world' and 'independent' cinema, i am not pretentious enough to take a disliking to Hollywood or blockbuster offerings. The recent offering of The Departed seems to highlight my point here excellently. I greatly enjoyed Infernal Affairs, and unlike many, was not filled with dread when Scorsese announced his intentions to sample the movie. And, overall, i enjoyed his product, but could not help thinking DiCaprio looked far from free, a mile away from where he seemed so desperate be. The Aviator and Catch Me If You Can seemed more organic an experience, but these offerings are balanced completely by restrictive and stiff performances in Gangs of New York (yes the sets are amazing, yes Daniel Day Lewis can act BIGTIME, NO it isn't a good film.) Blood Diamond by a mile offers Leonardo the most freedom and range of his modern offerings, if not all of them. Perhaps it is the darker, selfish element of DiCaprio's character that is so powerful, or perhaps Zwick is able to prise a show stopping performance from all of his actors, Leo not being in bad company with Washington, Pitt and Cruise arguably best performances! I guess my point is that, for actors like DiCaprio, who have scores of scripts to choose from and the phenomenal power to get them made, i wish they would allow themselves to take risks! Is it the case that a film can ruin a career? Lets ask Ben Affleck, who may never fully recover from a certain collaboration! I hope this doesn't sound negative as a comment, as i say i greatly enjoyed seeing Dicaprio let loose and act as, i believe, only he can in places, but perhaps that is because not many actors are afforded the chance! And perhaps if DiCaprio strayed slightly from the Hollywood forced romantic slow motion politically edgy climax, he could reach new levels of greatness! Let me know what you think"

","Firstly, by shocking I don't mean bad. By shocking I mean I was shocked to see how they suffered and the child soldiers. I thought that this was an excellent film and the acting was great. Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job at the accent as a South African diamond smuggler considering he had one month to perfect it. Jennifer Connelly did a great job as an American journalist and Djimon Hounsou gave a stunning performance as Solomon Vandy.<br/><br/>I haven't seen Little Miss Sunshine, Pan's Labyrinth or The Departed as many people say they are the best films of 2006 but from what I've seen so far this is the best film of 2006.

Dying of cancer, dying of pneumonia, dying of AIDS, yes, but when you look through a diamond what do you see? Do you see red rivers, with a higher concentration of blood than water? Do you see such merciless rape and slaughter, unimaginable to any human being? This film is not for everyone, but everyone has to see it.

Never boring, and not at all predictable. The character development was very good, especially seeing how fast the supposedly unsophisticated fisherman Solomon accurately sizes up Danny for a completely unprincipled opportunist. This is a story that could have gone quite badly if not for the fast action and top rate performances, by the three lead characters. DiCaprio's accent was a bit inconsistent but never distracting.

"AKAGAMASTER","10","1","3","9 December 2006"," Blood Diamond shines
","Director/Producer Edward Zwick's (""Last Samurai,"" ""Courage Under Fire,"" ""Glory"") ""Blood Diamond"" couldn't have been made without Djimon Hounsou (""Amistad,"" ""Gladiator"") who hails from the Dark Continent that has been plagued by ravaging disease, famine and civil war for decades. Set in Sierra Leone, fisherman Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) hooks up with the main protagonist of the story, mercenary Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio, in an Oscar worthy performance, complete with South African dialect on the money) while in prison. Seems Vandy has unearthed a rare pink diamond in the rough during his forced labor work after local insurgents separate him from his family, now on the run. He buries the gem, worth enough to change all their lives, in a conflict diamond field. Archer wants a cut, but he and Vandy clash on values; Vandy just wants to locate his family. To that end, Archer employs the help of newfound friend, an American journalist, Maddy Bowen (Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly, ""A Beautiful Mind""), who accompanies the unlikely duo in their quest for the life-altering bling. Along the way, Bowen realizes her crisis-driven career as a conflict story reporter for a value- based magazine lines up with Archer's angst having been brought up in dangerous territories like the ones she reports on. Hounsou's performance is so powerful and believable that he becomes part of the war torn yet breathtaking landscape as he races to find his estranged family. The movie soars as the characters' plight coaxes viewers to find out more about how approximately 15 percent of the world's consumer diamonds exported to places like the United States and United Kingdom are delivered with blood in their carats. And that blood is often spilled by child soldiers.<br/><br/>Writer's note: I actually know Djimon Hounsou from a cultural exchange program his brother participated in when Hounsou was working on his first film, ""Stargate.""

Djimon Honsou was exquisite as the father desperately using the only leverage he had to reclaim his family and Leonardo DiCaprio was the only choice for the diamond smuggler who marks him as his ticket out of town. Jennifer Connolly should not be forgotten either as the journalist trying to make a difference by getting the impossible story that would 'awaken' the western world to what is occurring. All play their parts brilliantly and convincingly with wonderful chemistry shared between them. The story begins by introducing the main characters and then among the violence and civil unrest in the region, allows their stories to unfold. The direction lets events unfold before you with honesty and emotional intensity, aided greatly by some of the best editing I've seen in film for years. This movie will reach all with a conscience, as it not only lays the guilt for ignoring the conflict, but for aiding it also. To understand, go and see the film.

"cultfilmfan","8","1","3","9 December 2006"," Blood Diamond
","Blood Diamond is set in the late 90's in Africa and is about a fisherman named Solomon Vandy who is taken away from his family and forced to work in the diamond mines. The film is also about an ex mercenary named Danny Archer who is looking for diamonds. Solomon finds a diamond and hides it and soon meets up with Danny who helps him escape from the mine and Solomon promises to help Danny find the diamond he buried if Danny will help him relocate his family. The two are also helped by a journalist named Maddy Bowen. The film is in some ways a thriller about escaping the guards and the violence that rule the country and in other ways is a drama dealing with political issues and about a man trying to get back to his family. Winner of The NBR Award for Best Supporting Actor (Djimon Hounsou, who plays Solomon) at The National Board of Review. Blood Diamond has good direction, a good script, great performances by the cast, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. I was impressed by this film in the way that it was a longer running film, but it never got boring and always had a good steady pace. The performances are great and worthy of award nominations and I like how the film incorporated political issues into this story and at the same time got to focus on these characters and become a bit of a character study. This is a good looking film as well and it is well directed and has a good script too. The film is quite powerful and moving in several ways as we care about Solomon and wish to see him reunited with his family and we also feel bad for the people of Africa who have been subjected to all this violence and loss. This is a well made and engaging film with a great cast and crew behind it and a powerful and engaging story that should keep your interest right till the end. Blood Diamond is one of the better films of the year and I can see it's cast and crew being nominated for several awards by the end of the year."

So, the politics in this movie are just over-the-top, so much, in fact, that the movie becomes more of a self-absorbed white crusade to make the world ""right"", rather than a movie that details people caught up in a story about the despicable diamond market. Leonardo di Caprio goes through his tirade about how this evil works, in a bid to show how angelic his character is, when, actually, his character is the most despicable by far. Then, of course, we have the typical American beauty, Connelly, who appears just to somehow make a bid on how the white world is sooooooooo sensitive to the plight of self-destructive Africaans.<br/><br/>This movie is overrated and was promoted so well by the Hollywood propaganda machine, it actually was a hit. Garnered 5 Academy Award nominations? For what? Di Caprio's stilted accent?"
"Bunuel1976","6","1","4","18 May 2007"," BLOOD DIAMOND (Edward Zwick, 2006) ***
","This film created some controversy when it emerged because it exposed the grim realities behind the diamond industry. Combining action, politics, romance and star power, BLOOD DIAMOND is well-made but essentially manipulative and sentimental; one even begins to doubt its intentions, whether it was genuinely made to raise awareness of the situation in South African diamond-mines or film-wise exploit their novelty and scoop value! <br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio is saddled with a silly accent - I personally found his performance in THE DEPARTED (2006) more impressive; Jennifer Connelly is pretty good, but her character seems like a glamorized version of a modern female reporter; as for Djimon Honsou, his undeniably heartfelt performance too often translates into grating hysterics. The rambling narrative sags alarmingly in its third act and, in any case, the film is full of the hand-held carnage we've been suffering from for the last decade or so! <br/><br/>It's been a week since I've watched BLOOD DIAMOND and, honestly, I can find nothing more appreciative to say about it which would justify my relatively high rating. Let's just say that it's a good film coming from today's Hollywood - but, as with most modern product, it's something I don't really need to ever revisit..."

I mean, come on, he's handsome and appears to be talented. Why not give him something else to do. Ona another note as an African American I am sick and tired of the White man saving the African movie storyline. How come Africans can't save themselves like in Hotel Rwanda.

","An overly violent film dealing with diamond smuggling in Africa.

","So many emotions rise up in this story of family, greed, war, and love. It is emotionally powerful, there were at least three moments in this film where I felt tears coming out of my eyes. I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie. Djimon Honsou gives the performance of his career, he should definitely at least be nominated in the best supporting actor category when the Oscars come around. There was one moment that was so compelling that my lips began trembling and I think my heart skipped a beat, and it is very seldom that a movie can give you that kind of shock and thrill. It is very thought provoking and touching with Edward Zwick proving he is one of the top directors out there currently. It gives you loads of political insights that a lot of people haven't been very aware of, I know. The photography is beautiful, there were two shots in the movie that left a smile on my face even after the tears were shed.This one of the best films to come around in a long time, I highly recommend it."
"moviegeek310","10","1","4","10 December 2006"," Blood Diamond better than is being said!
","While I was looking at various negative reviews for Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"", I realized that while most critics didn't like it, not one has come up with a plausible reason why except one. They all say that Zwick tries to hard to pound the film's ideas into your head. That's no reason to give it two stars, or C's and D's, just for being a little preachy. And yes, it was a little preachy, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is an exceptional film with stunning performances. ""Blood Diamond"" isn't preachy in a bad way either, the director just wanted to make sure the audience was educated to what was happening with the diamond trade in Africa. <br/><br/>I'll explain; the film opens with rebels going into a village and taking young kids and men to go work in the diamond mines, and then destroy the village. The rebels mine the diamonds and sell them to American jewelry dealers who then sell them to us. In the process, the rebels destroy innocent villages, capture the men, and train the children to use weapons for their cause. Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, who is taken along with his son. While working in the mind, Solomon finds a large diamond, which he hides. Before he is discovered hiding it, American troops arrive and drive out the rebels. Solomon escapes and joins up with Danny Archer, a diamond smuggler Â–played by Leonardo DiCaprio- who promises to help Solomon find his son in exchange for the diamond. Chase scenes galore ensue as Danny and Solomon make their way across Africa. <br/><br/>Before seeing this film, I never realized how some diamonds were come by, and the things done to the African people for them. Though, it is true, that at times it seemed like an exciting history lesson. The acting is superb and is all Oscar worthy. Leonardo finally breaks his pretty boy, sissy mold and becomes a macho, man's man, reminiscent of Indiana Jones. The cinematography is amazing, especially since Africa is already beautiful. The camera work accentuates the action scenes just so, that it makes it all the more exciting and intense. <br/><br/>So even though critics are being dumb again and bashing Zwick for making a ""history lesson"" film, it is still important to see. Even if it's just to see Leo and Djimon's Oscar worthy performances, and the insanely intense action sequences. I give ""Blood Diamond"" 8 out of 10. It is rated R for strong violence and language."

"a_dediego2","6","1","4","5 December 2006"," Thoughts
","I have just seen the movie at a screening, and I thought it was very well made. The trailers did no do Leonardo DiCaprio's acting justice, since it seemed that his accent was not accurate, but after listening to the rest of the cast and their accents, DiCaprio's is actually surprisingly accurate. The funny part about the film is that it seems to be one of the few DiCaprio films where he doesn't take his clothes off. It seems to me that Hollywood has such an attraction to the physical side of a player that they distract the viewer from the acting and the storyline by adding love scenes etc. something which this film did not have any of. The film was beautifully shot, with amazing establishing shots, which at certain points, although beautiful, made the movie appear to be too long. Overall, the acting was great and the film was well shot. The storyline was accurate and realistic, mainly because of the lack of a love scene (which obviously seems unnecessary, but many filmmakers would have included)."

"Leofwine_draca","7","0","1","5 December 2015"," Taut, original African drama
","When I first saw BLOOD DIAMOND advertised, the trailer put it across as a straightforward action film, nothing more, nothing less. It's nothing of the kind. Although the film does have a handful of well-played action sequences, it is in actual fact a drama through and through, dealing with the horrors of warfare and the plight of an oppressed country in the same way as a film like THE KILLING FIELDS. Despite it's length â€“ it does drag in a few places â€“ this is a very well made film, ably handled by director Edward Zwick, who previously treated us to THE LAST SAMURAI.<br/><br/>The camera-work is breathtaking, the script is intelligent and the cast is populated by some very good actors, not least DiCaprio, who with this and THE DEPARTED seems to have set himself a new benchmark in acting performances, and Djimon Hounsou, whose heart and soul performance carries the movie along through its dark places. It's also nice to see genre actors like Basil Wallace and Arnold Vosloo getting a chance to act in more serious fare. The plot is relatively complex, as many rival factions battle it out over the bloody diamond fields of Sierra Leone in the '90s, but it never loses you for a second and there's plenty to say about the situation, particularly in the original sub-plot involving desensitised child soldiers. Not a perfect film perhaps but still a very good one, chilling and moving when it needs to be."

Both men are African, but their histories as different as any can be, until their fates become joined in a common quest to recover a rare pink diamond that can transform their lives. While in prison for smuggling, Archer learns that Solomon--who was taken from his family and forced to work in the diamond fields--has found and hidden the extraordinary rough stone. With the help of Maddy Bowen, an American journalist whose idealism is tempered by a deepening connection with Archer, the two men embark on a trek through rebel territory, a journey that could save Solomon's family and give Archer the second chance he thought he would never have."

Most of it is due to Djimon Hounsou's powerful performance. Leonardo DiCaprio does a weird African accent, but I'm willing to overlook it. This movie has a grand scale. The refugee camp is big. The battles are surprisingly big. The subject matter is big. So it's very interesting that the best part of the movie is Solomon Vandy. The only drawback is that the story is too big.

"alciiru","8","0","1","4 July 2013"," blood diamond
","Do diamonds cost more than just money? Blood diamonds was released in 2006 and directed by Edward Zwick who has other great works like Shakespeare in Love, Courage under Fire, and the last Samurai. After watching this nerve wrecking film, l was convinced beyond any doubt, and knew that this is more than a simple action-drama entertainment. It was a story that needed to be told. The director not only had a mission to relay a great message, but also strove to enlighten the audience on horrible schemes and systems devastating the third world, particularly where diamonds come from. The film was set in the West African country of Sierra Leone during the 1990s, a time when the county was devastated by their instability because of such things as civil war, warlords, diamond syndicate, killings and enslavement of men forced to work in the diamond fields, and horrific use of children as soldiers. The title purposefully gets the audience expectant, which refers to Diamonds which were harvested, smuggled, and traded illegally to finance the purchase of weapons used in civil war. The director had a talented cast which came up with an imaginative plot together. Amidst all mayhem, pitiful screaming, and gunfire, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounson), a brave, courageous, family man in the fisherman profession was separated from his family, when the rebel army burned down their village, and sent him to work in a diamond hunting camp. His son Dia Vandy (Kasigo Kuypers), was aggressively captured and was taken to be used as a child soldier. At this point, he was forced to perform unspeakable acts by the ruthless men who had taken him into captivity. Solomon evokes painful emotions of anger and sadness as he swears to reunite with his family again, displaying his affection and everlasting bond between father and son, regardless of the circumstances. In the camp, Solomon discovers a rare priceless pink diamond, and somehow manages to steal and conceal after a violent attack at the mine he was working. Following this, he was forcefully imprisoned. At this point, Danny Archer (Leonardo Dicaprio), a South African Mercenary and diamond smuggler, surfaced into this portion of the movie. Motivated by greed, he was able to adequately portray a ruthless face; one that was determined to stop at nothing in order to achieve the ultimate goal of leaving Africa, it's fascinating to see how his character truly stands out. This is all because his inner self could not stand the horrible things going on in this place that he referred to as uncivilized. When he landed himself in prison for smuggling, he created a bond with Solomon which was solely focused on the rare pink diamond. Solomon was deeply anguished by the fact that his family was close to destitute but still declared his family to be worth more than a diamond. At this point, Solomon's urgency to find his family became very real and stood out. The characters skillfully took on a journey, but their' motives were clouded by their view of the rare stone as a means to accomplish their diverse goals. While Danny Archer was determined to get the diamond from Solomon and make a fortune, Solomon had his sights set on trying to get his family back at whatever cost. The characters embarked upon a gruesome journey that had its way with pushing some towards brutality. Danny Archer began to show a softer side, and as he portrayed a human side he went so far as to promise Solomon to find his family.<br/><br/>One of the more memorable quotes that showed the hope that these people were trying to breathe into a hopeless situation, was from Danny Archer (Dicaprio) saying ""sometimes I wonder if God will ever forgive us for whatever we have done to each otherthen l realizeGod left this place long time ago."" This brings up the question: Were people such as Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) the voice of hope for this disturbing corruption? Maddy was introduced as an American who joined the efforts of Dicaprio and Hounsou. She was determined to make a change in the world. Upon meeting each other, Maddy and Dicaprio hit it off, and Maddy became very compassionate towards Hounsou as well. The three main characters, because of their intense commitments to their goals, managed to bring an emotional and realistic view of a third world that had been shattering in turmoil. Their determinations and constant run for survival gave the film a powerful storyline. Though the film was intense, violent and was highly inclusive of action, making it also a very unfavorable movie for children, the gripping tension was compelling in and of itself and got viewers to keep watching.<br/><br/>The stunning visual effects and disturbing pictures of children either being kidnapped, killed or in the process of being trained to kill in an effort to have had these young minds molded into front line children soldiers was unbelievably nerve wrecking. Blood diamonds was a great film because of the enormous amount of cinematographic work that was inclusive of scenes that were beautifully photographed and with different African scenes, and the soundtracks were touching the core of the heart for this action movie. From start to finish, blood diamonds was beautiful and managed to push its mission to educate at the same time entertain. Overall, the fact was reinforced that precious diamonds did not have to cost poor innocent lives, and we saw the awareness brought. Blood diamonds challenged me and made me think about not taking life for granted. I highly recommend it for you or anyone else's must-watch list."

Hounsou has a great character, full of strength and love, and who faces terrible struggles. Sadly, his performance is given the passenger's seat to DiCaprio. DiCaprio's character hardly speaks for the film (that's Stephen Collins's job). He is at every point the embodiment of the ""white devil"", the trickster caucasian, betraying even himself at his best moments. DiCaprio plays this with a drive devoid of remorse - good or bad, he survives on his selfishness.<br/><br/>Hats off to Kagiso Kuypers (playing Hounson's son). A dark and challenging role for someone so young.<br/><br/>The film makes compelling points about the immorality of the blood diamond trade; how even the ends - the classic diamond engagement ring in Sydney, Toronto, or Honolulu - still bear the stain of rape, mass-murder, and colonialism. However, these points are given to us in brief, expositional dialogue between aggressive and apathetic action/battle sequences. These scenes are shot fast and loud - like a short roll of black cats - popping machine guns flash between quick shots of women and children falling, cap the enemy soldiers or rebels, back to DiCaprio bossing Hounsou around. Apartheid isn't over here.<br/><br/>It seems like ""Blood Diamond"" was dumbed down for Americans, betting against our empathy and instead trying to exploit the action/adventure blockbuster market. There are some deep, touching scenes, but they're cut short and ruined predictably by gunfire and explosions."

You can see his attention to detail and dedication to the part, the intensity of his acting. In this case, his use of a local African accent is, to my ears, flawless.<br/><br/>As to the movie, well, compared to ""Hotel Rwanda"", it still looks more like ""Con Air Goes To Africa"". Nevertheless, the character development is interesting even if obvious and the movie is well paced, so you never get bored. Djimoun Hounsou is a Mende fisherman.

They will try to arrange an escape to America for both the family and the diamond.<br/><br/>The depiction of the cruel African attacks owe more to ""Saving Private Ryan"" than reality, which is a shame, but then, this is a fiction that only uses African conflicts as a backdrop to what the DiCaprio's character has to go through along with Djimoun Hounsou, even if the movie is billed as being about the blood diamond trades."

Frankly, by the time it does, you will have experienced such a monotonous parade of brutality and slaughter that motives will have become lost in the fires, trampled underfoot, or washed away by blood. <br/><br/>It's a moral movie - like so many others - that seeks to point a simplistic finger of blame at the west for much of the dark continent's woes. Presumably, the west were to blame for what happened in Rwanda as well. And like so many others it fails to make its point with anything like the requisite intelligence and subtlety, relying too much upon graphic slaughter, moral cliché, and the popularity of its post-Titanic star. I actually preferred 'Tears Of The Sun', though all of these movies seem to suffer from weak endings.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the Oscar nominations, there are far more coherent movies in this genre that won't leave you suffering from tinnitus."

","BLOOD DIAMOND is quite boring. Which is a shame, because the moral of the story could have been used with something that could've turned out to be a film with its greatness similar to Hotel Rwanda, and although many have called it out for being preachy as a method to reinforce its message. The lack of character establishment aside, Blood Diamond fails to pack a punch, choosing cinematography that, instead of dazzling the viewer, distracts them from the message. It may be a masterpiece in the way that it is well-staged, the performances are at their best (but it could be said that they have had more challenging roles and have lived up to them). Despite the heart-wrenching scenes that are so often used in the film, it is dressed up as an irrelevant political point that is offensive. Edward Zwick's ambition is to display the exploitation of the diamonds and to make some political point about the lack of action in Western nations. The only moral that can be achieved is the former, because the second point is more distracting. The film does have a core: that a lot of the resources (in particular diamonds) we have today are only their due to the misery of others. But it requires far much thought than is needed due to the frustration that is evoked by choosing entertainment over matter, despite the risk that when matter is embraced, entertainment can stem out of it. Positives lie in the script and the positives and merit must be given in the importance it gives to survival."

","Blood Diamond, the Titanic in Africa. Here's the deal, Leonardo takes a dangerous journey, meets an American girl with an attitude, and there is a bloody great diamond involved. Plus a lot of innocent people die. The plot follows the Blood Diamonds from Sierra Leone, West Africa. Mined by slaves to fund a civil war, the diamonds flood the legitimate market after being laundered. In the movie, a slave, Solomon, finds and buries a huge mother of a pink diamond, then the camp is attacked. Solomon is freed but white diamond smuggler Danny hears about the diamond in prison, and the two get out of a heavily assaulted Freetown and form a reluctant bond, Solomon needing Danny's help to find his family and Danny wanting the pink stone. Riding shotgun is middle-class American chick with race guilt and nice hooters, Maddy, who also happens to be a photojournalist. As it turns out Solomon's wife and two daughters are in a camp, but his son has been impressed into service by the RUF (Rebel United Front). So Danny and Solomon head back to the camp to try and find the diamond and Solomon's son, who has now been exposed to mass murder and heavy drugs, a foul practice. Along the way we see the horrors of war in Africa, the retired South African white regiment that is now a mercenary army, the destruction the Africans visit upon themselves. A cheesy movie, Zwick has no depth, (like in Glory or Last Samurai he introduces racially charged topics and dramatic situations) yet it is effective because the material is so rich in human tragedy. Leonardo Di Caprio is cast very inappropriately. In Titanic, he was supposed to be a very worldly-traveled precocious young man. Here it is even worse; he is supposed to be this prematurely aged veteran of armed conflict. It just doesn't work, however it's always nice to see Jennifer Connelly, even with her clothes on. That black guy from Gladiator with the name like a fancy French sandwich with mustard is very good as well, but I would be wary starring next to him because the white guys he stars with all die and are therefore illegible for a sequel."

","It's a tragic story about conflict diamonds in Africa. Africa has the largest diamond mines in the world.

Where do those immaculate diamonds come from? <br/><br/>It's a truly alarm for me to reflect the value of things I purchased. Frankly speaking, most girls buy things impulsively and without much consideration of the value behind. Take the blood diamond as an example, people think that paying the market price is the only cost of a diamond, whereas the explicit cost is thrillingly far behind what we have imagined.<br/><br/>Those young African who deserve to enjoy their precious lives like us are deprived and forced to involve in the bloodbath. Some kids are even taught to shoot people within a second before knowing to grab a pen. Those physically alive, mentally dead African are extracting diamonds under being threatening every moment.<br/><br/>After watching this movie, I interrogated myself, ""Is it what I want from buying a diamond?""

","Blood Diamond (2006)<br/><br/>2006 was quite a year for movies. The Departed, Pans Labyrinth, Letters From Iwo Jima, Babel, Children of Men, Last King of Scotland, The Prestige, Etc. Even with all these great films Blood Diamond still stands out as one of the year's best. <br/><br/>Blood Diamond has so many things working in its favor. Fantastic performances by Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou, and Jennifer Connelly, great directing by Edward Zwick, amazing cinematography by Eduardo Serra, and an exciting and touching story by Charles Leavitt. It's so close to being a perfect film, it just barely missed the bar in my opinion. <br/><br/>The main thing working against it was the length. I have no problem with long movies, however I feel that a little too much time was spent with Jennifer Connelly's character. She did have an important role, I guess, but not as important as they made it, which stretched the film a little longer than I think it need to be. <br/><br/>With that aside it was great. DiCaprio and Hounsou's performances are probably both of their bests. The story kind of makes you not want to by diamonds. Which isn't really the message at all, it's just telling you not to by them from conflict areas. The story is so powerful, you feel for all the characters and want to do something about it. It's a outstanding mix of thriller, drama, and action films. <br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone. DiCaprio fans, action movie fans, drama movie fans, as I said, anyone.

","Lately, every film I see is so full of violence and suffering. Here the catch is diamonds and their impact on the world. Leonardo de Caprio is a mercenary, working the two sides against the middle. During this film, his character reclaims his soul. The strong suit of the film is the portrayal of the Africans who are victimized by the unfeeling diamond cartel and their own military infrastructure. It shows the process by which boys are kidnapped and then made into mindless soldiers fighting for a cause they don't even understand. I wish there had been a better sub-current of humanity and a little more human connection. I ask if this is the way it is or is it the way it is on the worst of days? What is truly astonishing is how the principle characters manage for so long to not get hit by fire. At times it's a bit much. Still, it sends a clear message that most of us ought to be aware of."

"nikpathak","9","0","1","2 June 2010"," Sierra Leone became 'famous' post this movie.
","Some of the reviews suggest that the conflict diamond situation has been exaggerated and completely distorted. I don't know if that is the case as I am a neutral viewer. The film makes a compelling case and a film that, while concerned with the political situation in Africa, focuses more on how the obsessive search for a large, rare pink diamond consumes those who get too close to it. In contrast to a film like 'Traffic,' 'Blood Diamond' doesn't wallow in hopelessness. Some of the characters might be cynical but the film itself does search for hope.<br/><br/>There is a great deal of violence in this movie, but that violence is organic, realistic. Connelly's role is much smaller but she makes the most of it though from a larger perspective her part was just a larger version of Joaquin Phoenix's in Hotel Rwanda. Its DiCaprio's performance that raises this film above the normal Hollywood 'flare' (although it is a solid script) into something memorable. His performance may be his best performance yet, and in terms of sheer charisma and it outlives his mega-star making performance as ""Jack Dawson"" in Titanic. Hounsou was wonderful as well, and the chemistry between the two men in their scenes together is spell-bounding. In comparing it to other recent films about Africa, this was quite as good (if not better) than Hotel Rwanda, but better than 'The Constant Gardener', and 'The Last King of Scotland'. An emotional engagement with the characters not experienced in the latter two films is found in this one. <br/><br/>The violent state of decay in Africa which is depicted is what reminds one of Hotel Rwanda; and if you liked that film you'll enjoy this one. It's overall message isn't too different. Where it deviates is that this film is much more action packed – the crossfire is nothing short of what you'd expect from a World War II movie. It was an overall nice balance between the dialog and action scenes. Apart from the visual and interpretative prowess of ""Blood Diamond"" there is a realistic view of a third world country as shattering as the unforgettable one in ""City Of God"".<br/><br/>The only shortcoming which leaves you at the end with a 'movie' feel rather than a 'hard hitting documentary' feel is the ending that they chose which extends the film too far, and to a certain extent seems forced to make the UN – like bodies look nice. The more apt ending would have been on the mountainside when Leo – injured guides the diamond to the chopper.<br/><br/>""Making a child a soldier when he grows up is fight against crime but making him a soldier during childhood is a war crime"" -- this movie artfully shows you why, without saying a word about it."
"glasgo04","8","0","1","25 April 2010"," Diamonds are more valuable than human life!
","The eye opening movie Blood Diamond, in my opinion, is a must see film. I could not help but to be amazed how Director Edward Zwick, brought to life the so real images of what it is like to live in Africa near the diamond mines. With the vivid imagery of the constant blood shedding, he gives us an insight on how worthless life could be when natural resources, such as, diamonds are being glorified in other regions of the world. It seems as though diamonds are more valuable than human's life. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, who is from Africa and is a confidant of Colonel Coetzee played by Arnold Vosloo. His life is on the line when a smuggling deal goes bad, and he is force to repay Colonel Coetzee. Danny's ticket to life is discovered through a local fisherman, known as, Solomon Vandy, played by Djimon Hounsou, who has one of the biggest diamond ever seen. Solomon, separated from his family in a brutal rebel invasion, was force to work as a miner. While working in the blood-infested diamond mine, he locates the rare diamond, and hides it underground, so no one would have access to it. Solomon's son Dia Vandy, played by Kagiso Kuypers, was also captured by the rebels. He was brainwashed, and forced to work as a child-soldier. His wife and two girls were detained, and held at the Tassin Refugee Camp.<br/><br/>This movie shows that an individual may appear to be a heartless human being from what has been instilled in them, but as Benjamin Kapanay said while talking to Danny,"" A person is inherently good, but can become corrupted by his surroundings."" Three similar scenes that relates to this theme are when Captain Poison the commander of the mine looks at Solomon and said, ""You think I am a devil, but it is only because I have lived in hell."" Another insight was looking at the transformation of Dia Vandy. He was a typical child, full of life that enjoyed school and soccer. His father Solomon had hopes for his son to become a doctor. His hope was later shattered, when his son was kidnapped, and brainwashed to become a brutal killer. Dia, was given the new name, Bossman. He was told to erase any memory of his family, as his new family was now the RUF. His father in disbelieve of his son's transformation calls out to him while sneaking into the rebel's camp and was shock to discover his son's disapproval of him as he yelled, ""stranger, enemy"" as if they was no ties to him. Danny's mind was also altered, when he realized that the same government he served was no better than the rebels were. He becomes a diamond smuggler for Colonel Coestzee. <br/><br/>A few elements that captured my attention, was Danny's chain-smoking when he seemed to be annoyed, or in need of a stress reliever, similar to the the movie The Hurt Locker. Sergeant James seemed to smoke every chance he got, and carried a pack of cigarettes with him. Danny however, did not often carry cigarettes with him, but would ask just about everybody he met for a smoke, like he did his partner Cordell before launching a punch in his stomach, and one of the military soldiers.<br/><br/>There are a few film techniques, which Zwick used to bring this film to life. The two that caught my attention was the gun motif and the long-shot scenes. It seemed like everyone carried a gun, and most of the times the guns were noticeable as seen in the RUF camp. The boys carried guns at all times, as a sign of power, and demanded respect. Danny also carried a gun at all times, however, his was less noticeable, as seen in the scene when he went to visit Commander Zero, he pulls it from his back trousers and handed it to the soldier. I also noticed several long-shot scenes that showed beautiful sceneries in the distance, but in the mix of such a scenic place lies constant death and destruction. These long-shot scenes can be seen, as the plane flies across the green covered mountains and at the end of the movie while Danny sits on the hill taking to his friend on the phone he says,"" I am looking at an incredible view."" <br/><br/>This movie is very graphic and can be very disturbing to watch, especially, seeing children stripped away from their childhood and innocence while brainwashed into becoming brutal soldiers, but overall a great action movie. This movie is a bit lengthy, but is worth every minute. It was interesting to see how a diamond makes its way to some of our local jewelry stores."

","I'm going to start by saying that I felt this movie very deeply, partly due to it's very powerful and emotional story, partly because of the solid and strong performances of DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou which was a good surprise.<br/><br/>This movie has a political side to it, the RUF (Revolutionary United Front) is a violent group of rebels that kidnaps children, destroys their innocence with drugs and alcohol transforming them into one of the rebels themselves with a complete brainwash, while enslaving adults to work on a diamond field. Diamonds those, that are used to fund their war. However the main point of interest in this film, is the quest of a fisherman (Djimon Hounsou), made slave by the RUF, to try and save his son, who was kidnapped by RUF as well, when he is rescued by a diamond smuggler (Leonardo Dicarpio) who is only interested in... diamonds.<br/><br/>The story becomes a painful journey for these men, each one using the other to reach their own goal. It's interesting to see the evolution of the relationship between them and the character development twists as they become closer. Specially interesting to see is the inner conflicts going on with DiCpario's character.<br/><br/>It becomes with no doubt an emotional ride within a violent and intense story. I don't mean violent in a graphical way (the movie has some very tough scenes though), but violent in the way the movie explores and deals with the darkest and evilest sides of men's nature as well as what despair and force of will can achieve.<br/><br/>If I was child living in the situation those African children were living, I would look at the RUF and I would see the purest state of fear and evil, so great of an evil that it could torture and twist you to the point of destroying all the good and innocent in you and transform you in fear itself. Now this is what this child is experiencing and what this father is trying to stop at all costs... heavy no? This movie is definitely worth to be seen, it's a human story with a inhuman side to it, though not everyone will have an easy time watching it. I watched this movie with my father (who is actually a very sensitive person concerning movies and not-only) and he greatly enjoyed the movie but had trouble watching some of the more powerful scenes due to its incredible realism.<br/><br/>Great story, great drama, powerful performances and a beautiful reporter as well (Jennifer Conneli, I forgot to mention you!).

","This was a film that I connected with, as with Hotel Rwanda and unlike Black Hawk Down. DiCaprio pulls off his finest performance ever and Djimon Hounsou is excellent. The film succeeds in being entertaining whilst showing the horrors of the Sierre Leone civil war, a subject which I knew nothing about. This was something I think Black Hawk Down failed at, it did de-glamorise violence but at the same time failed to engage me with the characters. Blood Diamond certainly does engage the viewer with the characters, and you do feel a genuine emotional attachment with DiCaprio and Hounsou's characters in particular at the end of the film. I fell for the film and by the end of it felt completely engrossed in the lives of the extraordinary people portrayed in it. There were also some really nasty but relevant issues brought up, war crimes, child soldiers, the reminiscence of the bitterness of white supremacy in Africa (from both points of view) and of course the main one- the trading of conflict diamonds."
"cathcacr","Null","0","2","23 December 2009"," Just so we're clear, DiCaprio's character is monstrous
","Let's see if we have this right: in order to acquire the diamond, Archer (DiCaprio) orders a bombing raid on a village with innocent slaves (including children). If Connelly's character knew about this, would she have been nearly this friendly to him over the phone at the end? Did the scriptwriters really think this one through?<br/><br/>I suppose we were supposed to sympathize in some way with Archer throughout the film. And I actually did. He seemed like a man who would get his hands dirty in pursuit of his high-risk obsessions. He's crafty, skilled, and smart. And then we get thrown for a loop 90 percent of the way through the film. Then we're left wondering just how and by what Archer is motivated. After ordering his bombing raid, he seems to show compassion towards Hounsou's character, and yet why? He might as well murder him as well and make off with the diamond. He was willing to murder his only son, after all, the son being the only reason Hounsou went with him. Which is worse? And why does Hounsou treat this monster with any compassion afterward? It doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Director Edward Zwick pulled this same sort of nonsensical stuff in the climax of _The Last Samurai_, where Cruise's army runs straight to their deaths for no good reason. Zwick appears to be little more than a run-of-the-mill Hollywood director ruined by the system, producing cheap thrills irrespective of the importance of underlying substance. Go back and look how it's in pretty much every film he's made."

","Coming into the film, I had heard it was good but I tried not to get myself all set up for a letdown. I was, however, drawn into the movie without even really realizing it, and then all of a sudden at some undefinable moment in the first hour or so I was very invested in the story and the characters.<br/><br/>First off, as a film set in Africa, I felt that it did justice to capturing the tragic element of Africa without making it too (and by too, I mean relatively speaking) ""Hollywood."" I felt that the movie was in no hurry just to rush through setting the tragic stage in Africa on the way to delivering a Hollywood plot line. Rather, I felt and very much appreciated the depth of the movie and the fact that it gave significant and sufficient time to really try to explore and capture what the tragedies and chaos in Africa looks like, as with the depiction and actual engagement with children soldiers, the village raids, and frenzied chaos of not only violence and fear, but the suffering, pain, and emotions of humanity in the midst of it.<br/><br/>As to the story, the basic plot line is not one for the ""list of top 10 greatest movie twists"" or something like that. But it isn't supposed to be. The power of the movie comes in the unfolding of the story--what you see taking place, how the characters react, and the very poignant capture of the tragedy of humanity and what is happening in Africa. The greatness of the movie comes from what lies beneath the plot and shines through it.<br/><br/>As to the characters, DiCaprio's Danny Archer is simply unforgettable. You at first judge him, then are unsure of how to view him, then are mystified, and finally embrace him and his humanity. DiCaprio's performance was masterful. Djimon Hounsou's character was also very well played, but was less complicated by its very nature (less inner conflict meant less development) so Danny Archer really shines above both Solomon Vandy and Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly's character--also well played but much more of a supporting role and less in the forefront of the movie's story).<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie is a must-see for everyone. It, like Hotel Rwanda (a great one), is a powerful movie that captures some of the deepest and more raw suffering and tragedy of humanity amidst chaos, conflict, and violence on the stage (Africa) which it is probably most prevalent at present, though sadly not noticed enough. If that doesn't grab you, Danny Archer's character is so poignant and beautiful that he stays with you. Don't miss your chance to get to know him. Finally, go call, email, or send letters to your Congressman or your Representative or government and put pressure on them to do something about the violence and genocide in Africa!"

","There is no way i can criticise this film at all. This film is one of the best films i have ever seen. To me films are really difficult to get my attention. But this film will get you: crying, gasping and realise how fortunate we are. Djimon Hounsou is at his best. Leonardo Dicaprio is also at his best. I would have to say it is one of my favourite films. Its about a man, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) that loses his son and goes to look for him. But he gets kidnapped and finds a diamond. And that is all i will say.<br/><br/>If you see it in the shops i recommend you buying it. No matter the cost.

","If nothing else, this film does a good job in bringing to light the controversy over ""conflic diamonds"", which I've not seen anywhere else. The story takes place during a violent revolution in Sierra Leone where the male child of a fisherman is conscripted into a sadistic army funded by diamonds sold for weapons. Djimon Hounsou, whom you may recognize from other films, plays Solomon Vandy whose family is terrorized in early scenes, and then broken apart by these revolutionaries. His only hope is that he knows the location of an enormous diamond big enough to get all the right (white) people involved that may help him track down his son and defeat those who have taken him. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a white African diamond smuggler/soldier of fortune kind of guy who really, really wants this diamond and knows he has to keep Solomon safe in order for him to show him where it is buried. Along the way, the two befriend a female journalist (Connelly) who is more interested in the plight of the masses displaced by the violence. Each of these three need and use each other when it suits them best. The action is often intense, and the carnage is jarring, to say the least.<br/><br/>The film has many strengths. It does get the viewer involved in the struggles of this part of Africa, and it does make you care about the personal plight of these characters. DiCaprio is pretty much hit and miss in terms of acting. Though his performance is not spectacular, I did buy his character a bit more than I expected to. Hounsou is much more believable, and Connelly often comes off as window dressing. The film relies maybe a bit more on action than it needs to. And one may think the white leads are here only for box office fuel. The film was kind of a bomb in theaters, but it did garner some Oscar nominations for DiCaprio and Hounsou. The photography is very lush and makes one lament what a beautiful place Africa would be without all of the carnage and human problems that seem endless.<br/><br/>Go ahead and give this film a try. It will keep your interest throughout, and if nothing else it may make you think twice about where pretty diamond jewelry comes from. 7 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","Blood Diamond is about a war in Sera Leon and the murder of the locals for the acquisition of diamonds. The criminals here brutally use their own as slaves to harvest the minerals that will make them rich. It also highlights the greed and manipulation that characterizes the international diamond market. The characters are well developed and there are very strong acting performances, especially Leornard DiCaprio and Jennifer Connelly. The film really makes memorable points about how money corrupts. Child soldiers, gangsta rap, and human rights violations are portrayed with realism and great effect to convey the theme in creative ways. This film will stay with you for a long time!

"warren-1976","10","0","1","14 April 2009"," A Resounding Surprise And Success
","I have to admit, I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film. Leonardo DiCaprio, and a Hollywood 'message' movie rolled into one. I am very happy to say that I was truly surprised and impressed, and my worries were proved unfounded.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou is excellent as Solomon, while Jennifer Connelly is good in a somewhat limited and slightly stereotyped role. However, the real stand out performance is DiCaprio. I will freely admit I have never been a fan, usually finding him weak and unimpressive in his younger roles, and in more recent years he has proved reasonably good but not awe inspiring. In Blood Diamond he got me. For the first time, I wasn't watching DiCaprio act, but the character he played. Rightly, both DiCaprio and Hounsou were Oscar nominated for their performances. <br/><br/>Whether Blood Diamond is an accurate or exaggerated portrayal of events I don't know, and only those who experienced what happened in that time and place could say. As a story though, it fires on all cylinders, providing a thought provoking and hard-hitting tale. There are various themes, and it portrays its characters fairly even-handedly. Danny's character is a grey and nuanced individual, who doesn't fit all the typical stereotypes. He can be selfish, insulting and prejudiced whilst also showing that beneath it all he can be self-sacrificing and thoughtful. The other characters and events make him re-evaluate his priorities and goals, but not in a typical 'life changing' way. It's more as though he already was that person, he just needed reminding. It makes a change from the type of character who 'sees the light and suddenly becomes good'. <br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly does well in what is really a thankless role. In essence she is a sounding board for revealing Danny's character, and getting over the film's political and social conscience and/or message. Her character is also somewhat of a stereotype, with the 'exposing incorruptible reporter', but it's to her credit that we do not lose sympathy with Maddy. <br/><br/>The film is not perfect. There is one scene where Solomon acts stupidly and out of character, shouting at a passing truck in the darkness, but this can be forgiven as it does not affect the story, and is primarily a story device used to trigger a dark character moment between Solomon and Danny. The conclusion of DiCaprio's character is possibly the most predictable and clichéd event, but from a story perspective, it is the most effective and meaningful. Sometimes such story devices have to be used, as they work well for a reason.<br/><br/>Some have criticised the film's ending for being too 'Hollywood' and proceeding beyond what was necessary. In all honesty, I felt that without that ending, without that conclusion for the characters, the impact of the overall story would have been lessened. It is like the ending of a movie such as The Shawshank Redemption, where critics managed to complain about its ultimately uplifting 'Hollywood' ending, stating that it was out of place and at odds with what went before. Yet that is the whole point. It is the contrast that lifts up the story's conclusion, and gives everything leading to it, a point and reason.<br/><br/>With regards to how it was filmed, it has to be said there is some wonderful cinematography to be found. I genuinely felt drawn into the film and its story, and was never jolted out of it by any false and forced 'documentary' style camera work, which has become an over-used technique in recent years. The pace and editing show their quality, when you suddenly realise you have watched a film that is over two hours, without once feeling it.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a very human and personal tale, set against tragic events. By centring on the characters, it tells its story and message to best effect, without too much preaching and posturing. If you took away the message, it would still be an intense and riveting tale about the individuals involved, and that is why it works so well, and makes for an excellent film."

Some of the scenes were very moving especially what happens to the fisherman's son. There is a good amount of violence, which should be expected. The score by James Newton Howard is somewhat unusual for him, but this new style works.<br/><br/>Edward Zwick, the famed director of The Last Samurai and Defiance, did a very good job.

"valid908","7","0","2","23 December 2008"," Good movie - bad accent and some other notes:
","I enjoyed this movie and thought that the political message of it was important. The acting was decent especially by the main black character who played the father. He was completely believable in his emotions and focus on his son.<br/><br/>I did have issues with Leonardo's accent though since it really did not come across as authentic at all. Some of the beginning of his performance to me was a little weak and almost like he was posing for the camera half the time. Also, did he need to smoke that much for this character? I assume Dicaprio is a fond smoker himself given that he practically smoked in every scene of this movie! I really didn't understand why the smoking was so glamorized in this movie. Coming from losing a mother to lung cancer I guess I have a different perspective but i didn't see that it was necessary for the constant smoking in the scenes.<br/><br/>Towards the end however I feel that Dicaprio shined in his acting and in his change of heart towards his greediness in obtaining the big diamond. you could see his conflict within himself in wanting to help the father find/save the son and from his own greedy desires.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a really good film but if i compared it to ""the constant gardener"" I would have to say that this film is inferior to that level of a movie. Definitely worth a watch but could do without Dicaprio's fake accent and constant smoking!"

","I get a great deal of satisfaction from watching Oscar tabbed films. Why? Because like most people, I love dissecting which are deserving and which are not. Everything about Blood Diamond screams it deserves, yet these cries are hollow. Because Blood Diamond echoes 'Hollywood'.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond features an Oscar 'worthy' cast of Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou, and Jennifer Connelly. They play Oscar worthy characters with accents, faulty personalities, and sad stories. It is directed by an Oscar worthy Director in Edward Zwick(Glory, The Last Samurai). It has an Oscar worthy story that taps into the human condition. It has an Oscar worthy release date(can anyone say Christmas holidays...). It has an Oscar worthy conclusion. Are we noticing a theme here?<br/><br/>The sad truth is that a truly meaningful story that needed to be told was done to manipulate. The plight of 3rd World countries tugs at any persons heart strings. We all want to say we're doing our part to help those in need. Blood Diamond is made to reaffirm this. Then why is Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role when a real South African actor is not? Three words: Hollywood Star System. Why is their a romance in the middle of a larger conflict a la Titanic. Three more words: People like it.<br/><br/>I wanted to say I liked it. Trust me, I did. But what message does this movie send by having an ending that concludes everything? The problems of that region are not solved. The reading at the end is a cop-out for a film that didn't want people to stop and say, ""Wait, what happens now?""

","I very rarely give films a 10 and this one is by no means perfect. For example, DiCaprio's accent was a bit annoying and there were times when he seemed to out-Bond James Bond. Parts of it were really not completely plausible, and were obviously glamorized to make a more compelling film.<br/><br/>Having said that, a film like this is vital on 2 levels. First, it enlightens and educates people, who are probably not aware of the evil of conflict diamonds. This flick is a real consciousness-raiser, in that regard.<br/><br/>This movie takes the violence from rural areas and then amps up the shock factor by moving that same violence into an allegedly more cosmopolitan urban setting.<br/><br/>The second thing this movie does so well, ""Blood Diamond"" is one of the few films to really show what is happening to the children and some of the victimized citizenry in several African nations. The violence shown in this film has been an ignored story for years, to the world's shame.<br/><br/>I felt this movie did a vastly superior job in conveying the horror than ""Hotel Rwanda"" did. While we are talking about 2 separate stories, the common thread is the use of children to perpetuate violence and the disgusting things people can do to their neighbors, over fanatically-inspired hatred.<br/><br/>The fact that ""Blood Diamond"" exposed the violence makes this movie worth its weight in gold.<br/><br/>This movie changed my world-view.

I found the violence did not get to be overdone, although it is a terribly violent film. I did see elements of the rawness of war, although not perhaps enough. I am sure they could not do more without alienating the audience. They presented a number of different viewpoints and interestingly a subtle commentary on some underlying ethnic issues in the diamond industry and Africa and insight into the real problems of the diamond industry, especially in that the are horded to be artificially scarce; any diamond creating a market for war. As regards the technical elements of the film, direction is quite good as one would expect from my comments above, and script writing and production are excellent. I think Connelly's character needed more development and is a bit too pristine. I think the direction lacked focus a bit here. DiCaprio is good, but the accent is awful. Hounsou is excellent.

","Blood diamond was a critically acclaimed movie & touted as the best movie of 2006. It really lived up to that reputation as far as I am concerned.<br/><br/>It is a plot driven story of a Sierra Leon worker, who is separated from his family during the internal conflict. Later, his life revolves around a large piece of conflict diamond that he discovered while working as a forced labor in the diamond mines. He comes across several people with vested interest in that diamond including Leonardo Di Caprio. Jenifer Connelly plays the role of a journalist who wants to expose the whole conflict diamond trade link. The escapades of the trio from the conflict zone remind you of a bond movie. The movie is fast paced and it also explores the emotional aspect of the relationships between different people.<br/><br/>The best aspect of the movie is the hard core reality that it has portrayed about the life in war-torn Africa. The way the conflict has affected the life of people & the way children have been forced to take up arms & join the rebels. It has also raised a question as to how diamonds that we long to possess actually cost people in Africa their life. Sometimes it makes you feel that you are watching a documentary on BBC.<br/><br/>The performance of Djimon Hounsou as Solomon Vandy, the African worker is exemplary & surely makes him a strong candidate for the Oscars. Even Jenifer Connelly has played the role of a conscientious journalist to perfection. Leo has also done justice to his part as a Rhodesian diamond smuggler.<br/><br/>All in all it's a movie which is definitely worth watching both for the artistic value as well as the awareness it creates."
"johnnyboyz","8","0","1","24 September 2007"," Much like the diamond, this film is a jewel.
","Blood Diamond plays out like a number of things. Its use of a Macguffin to forward the plot is easy to spot but it makes full use of its approach and at times, the film will feel like a war film in the vein of Black Hawk Down minus the American soldiers; a secret agent film in the vein of a 'Bourne' film with DiCaprio replacing Damon and a political thriller surrounding a desperate situation in another country which isn't developed enough to deal with it itself.<br/><br/>What felt fresh about Blood Diamond is its use of the diamond as the object and the country of Sierra Leone as the setting. I doubt if the film would've been as good had the diamond been a case of money being sought after in a city and it reminded me distinctly of a novel I read a couple of years ago entitled 'Night of the Fox' which was a Second World War story about an Allied general who gets washed up in France following a boat attack and is carrying extensive knowledge about the D-Day landings planned for France within the next month or so. Needless to say, certain Axis powers and characters all try and get their hands on it as it could prove vital for the Nazi effort. Blood Diamond was this sort of unpredictable, middle of a dystopia film with several powers all trying to find what's what.<br/><br/>I especially liked the character study Blood Diamond had and its attention to development and detail as events unfolded. DiCaprio plays his character, Danny Archer, like a secret agent throughout most of the opening third but then as we get to know him more and more, it becomes clear why he's acting in that way and why he's so good at evading capture and dodging bullets. This is contrasted to the character of Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) whose story is so much more compelling and involving; where Archer's side of the film plays out like a Bourne film, Vandy's is more of an Apocalypto. But these two different approached are separated once the coming together of the two characters happens. They are combined in an effort where the film retains its 'Bourne' and 'Apocalypto' feel yet goes down the road of 'D-Day plans in France' or 'Bag of money in a city' obviously using a huge diamond buried somewhere in a war torn country full of jungle, warlords and greedy South African commandos.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond becomes more action packed when the two leads combine. There is a fabulous scene in a street where after literally just meeting, Archer and Vandy are caught in a crossfire between two sides that escalates into a spontaneous war zone; echoing Black Hawk Down but also a Bourne film. There are also other scenes such as the escape of an ambush and a chase involving a jeep  the following exchange at a checkpoint guarded by kids with AK-47s is equally as compelling. But the whole time, Archer and Vandy sort of remain enemies as they're both after different things  Vandy wants the diamond and his family whereas Archer, deep down, just wants the diamond.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond is not only a fast paced, adrenaline fuelled action film with excellent dialogue, acting and character development but also as a political comment on not only Sierra Leone's situation but Africa's as a whole. One character states how she says CNN will probably squeeze a report of Africa's troubles in-between the sports news and the weather forecast and there is further evidence of richer countries ignoring the situation when a bar television has Clinton addressing problems on his supposed affair and not problems on Sierra Leone's civil war. This is of course dealt with toward the very end when gracious acknowledgement is given to certain characters and I'll say that simple shots of Jewelry shop fronts have never been more meaningful. Blood Diamond is powerful and important as well as remaining entertaining and compelling."

","From director Edward Zwick (Legends of the Fall, The Last Samurai) this is quite a gripping action thriller with controversial imagery and realistic situations. Based in 1999, Sierra Leone, the film sees fisherman Solomon Vandy (Amistad's Oscar nominated Djimon Hounsou) dreams that his son, Dia Vandy (Kagiso Kuypers) will grow to be a doctor, but this is shattered when rebels invade his village, and kidnap him and his family. He is forced to work in the diamond mines, and it is there that he comes across a huge pink diamond, and he managed to hide it just before being arrested by the government army. It is in the jail that diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio, with a slightly confusing accent) from Zimbabwe overhears his find, and releases Soloman proposing to help him find his family in return for finding the diamond. Using American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) they manage to find Soloman's wife Jassie (Benu Mabhena) in a refugee camp, but he finds out his son has been recruited by the rebels. Danny and Soloman then start their journey, Soloman concentrating on finding his son more than the diamond, Danny the diamond and redemption (the diamond will help him get away). They do eventually find the rebels, and this is when Danny arranges his ""friend"" Colonel Coetzee (The Mummy's Arnold Vosloo) to send an army to take them out, and when they find Dia, he has almost been brainwashed to hate his Dad. In the end, they find the diamond, Danny gives up after being shot, talking on the phone to Maddy in his last moments, and Soloman goes to London with the diamond to represent the rebel situation in his country.

The imagery of black children forced to kill their own people is disturbing (I only heard of that kind of stuff on Comic Relief), DiCaprio as the anti-hero and Hounsou as the desperate father are both worthy Oscar nominees, the action is gripping, the only bad things that can be said is that it was typical to see the anti-hero give up easily when getting shot and one or two moments of only okay sentimentality, but besides that it is a good thought-provoking film.

","An excellent storyline, but the political slant combined with 'Hollywoodism', keeps this movie from being a 10 star film. Hollywood should take notice that a longer run time doesn't mean a better film. This movie could have and should have been shortened. Even with the storyline and fast action scenes, the film still drags in places. DiCaprio and Hounsou are indeed the diamonds in this film. Brilliant talent shining brightly throughout the film is what will hold your interest. The accents were a bit difficult to follow in places, but not enough to cloud the understanding of the scenes. The storyline serves up political intrigue, brutal violence, child exploitation, shoot outs/explosions, car chases, greed, and even love. There are a few shots of breathtaking beautiful mountain scenery. Overall, a film worth watching, but it is a bit too long and a bit too political."

","On a few previous comments regarding both ""The Illusionist,"" and ""Rocky Balboa,"" I had stated that not only those two, but others, were better than the Oscar winner ""The Departed."" Well, here is another. ""Blood Diamond"" is a very ""grown up"" film which delivers not only some intense drama, but also some good old fashioned action, not to mention, it's historical, and political perspective. The story is involved, the characters are engaging, and well developed, and to me, the finished product was very good. A number of other Oscar winners come to mind. This film is better than ""Crash,"" not by much, and way better than both the nonsensical and overrated films ""Traffic"" and ""The Departed."" So do yourself a favor and watch this film, it is very solid, and DiCaprio delivers a surprisingly good performance considering he had to carry an accent through the whole thing. Great film!"

","Tara had been keen to see this for a while, so we got it out last night ""Blood Diamond"" is a story based upon the ruthless diamond industry in Africa. It follows the story of Solomon, an African man who discovers a massive diamond while prospecting under duress. Word gets out about his discovery and he soon is tracked down by Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio, in a much manlier role than ""Titanic""). Danny is a diamond smuggler and sees getting this diamond as his chance to get out of Africa.<br/><br/>It's a powerful movie, giving great insight into the diamond trade in Africa. It shows us the horrific political struggles going on in parts of Africa and the devastation many people face. To be honest, some of it went way over my head, but it again hammers home the atrocities that go in this continent for luxuries to provided to the West.<br/><br/>An excellent cast, spearheaded by Leo, as well as some amazing cinematography. Gripping. Worth seeing."
"ciribiribin","9","0","1","1 June 2007"," A Gem
","Blood Diamond is an excellent movie. See it.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond is reminiscent of old Hollywood. Yes, Virginia old-fashioned heroes (and villains) do exist. Good (and bad) can be painted in vivid, living color. Just desserts can be served after the main course.<br/><br/>The story is original and captivating. The plot is tight. Characters are fleshed out. Dialogue is fresh and believable. The action flows seamlessly from the characters' motivation. The theme of the movie is noble and honest. The acting is superb all-around. The movie is beautifully filmed. The ending is true to the theme. Even the musical score is outstanding.<br/><br/>My only quibble, which accounts for my less-than-perfect rating, is the movie's length. Tighter editing could have helped the movie move along at a faster pace. The G-8 political business at the beginning and end of the film is unnecessary and preachy. The movie's theme is well-enough developed that it doesn't need to be spoon fed. Some of the chase/combat scenes seem interminable and could have been cut short.<br/><br/>However, I especially appreciated the moments of sincere dialogue between Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Connelly. The film treats their relationship with perfect subtlety and understatement, which only serves to make their connection somehow more intense.<br/><br/>I think DiCaprio's performance deserves to be singled out. He was flawless and believable in the role, again reminiscent of yesteryear actors who might have been pegged for such a role (Robert Mitchum?, Richard Widmark?). Any criticism that DiCaprio lacks the machismo to carry off such a part is unfounded.<br/><br/>This film, which I didn't expect I would like, goes a long way to restore my faith in present-day Hollywood's ability to make good movies."
"JesusTwinFish","9","0","1","27 May 2007"," Friendship, Love, and Human Ambition
","This movie has a lot of good points behind it. However, one in particular that was obviously noticeable was the political message: conflict diamonds. Of course that seemed to be the major motif in the film. However, I saw it differently. This movie seemed to be a movie about love, friendship, and human ambition with the political message as it's catalyst.<br/><br/>Love is the connection between Danny and Maddy. Clearly, these two fell for each by the time Danny left her to go with Soloman after the diamonds, and at the end when Danny says ""I'm really glad I met you"" and Maddy responds ""I'm really glad I met you too"" they clearly wanted to say ""I love you"" but, Archer is a man that tries not to feel so he couldn't say it. Mr. Zwick may not have gone into a great deal of detail with their love however it is greatly performed by DiCaprio and Connelly when they are on screen together and you can really sense their loss when Maddy walks off to go into the plane. Zwick also seemed to take a different direction with the love also: NO SEX SCENE. That is truly amazing given the fact that Hollywood usually finds a way nowadays to sneak in sex scene, but not this one. So props to this movie for not doing it.<br/><br/>Another motif is that of friendship. Danny and Soloman seem to have a connection between them in the fact that they are both providing services for each other to get what they both want. However, it is clear by the end of the movie Danny and Soloman become more than just associates - they become friends; cherished friends. Enough to the point that Danny gives up his life for Soloman and his son. Even though Danny wouldn't say it, he did it for them; the diamond was just his bonus. However, and tragically, his bonus was also his ambition. Ambition is a big theme in anybody's life - however it cannot become your whole life, like it did Danny's. And that is ultimately what lead Danny to his death.<br/><br/>So watch and enjoy this movie. Not because of the mediocre political message, but because of it's accurate display of Friendship, love, and Human ambition - and how they all coincide, and how they can all make or break one's life. This is truly an excellent film with excellent character development and excellent relationship displays. Blood Diamond is a classic, and deserves to be treated as such. Get it into the top 250."

","A story following Archer, a man tortured by his roots. With a strong survival instinct, he has made himself a key player in the business of conflict diamonds. Political unrest is rampant in Sierra Leone as people fight tooth for tooth. Upon meeting Solomon, and the beautiful Maddy, Archer's life changes forever as he is given a chance to make peace with the war around him.<br/><br/>I liked this film a lot. It is somewhat similar to Hotel Rwanda which shows us an even that happened that we weren't aware of. This shows us where we get our diamonds. What we don't know is that people actually try to kill themselves to find these rare diamonds.<br/><br/>There are many moments you will find very wrong. This film shows us the truth and is very emotional, if you're that kind of person. The acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou are really Oscar worthy giving superb performances while Jennifer Connelly was just good. I loved the scenery in the film. The whole view is wonderful, filled with spectacle.<br/><br/>I really don't know what else to say about this film but it's one of the best in 2006 and it's truly heart breaking to try to sit through some violent scenes. This movie is not for children and I'm glad it doesn't have a complicated plot to follow. Watch it if you really like good films."

"view_and_review","10","0","1","17 May 2007"," I cannot rave enough about this movie
","When I saw Hotel Rwanda about a year ago, it was the saddest, most disturbing, most depressing movie I'd seen in my life. Blood Diamond is a very close second. And like Hotel Rwanda, Blood Diamond was masterfully done. It almost seems paradoxical that a movie so incredibly sad and morose could be considered excellent. But oddly, it is the movie's ability to evoke such deep and genuine emotions that makes it so good.<br/><br/>DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly were phenomenal. I haven't seen every DiCaprio movie, but his performance in this picture outstrips everything before it. His character was very complex and layered and he nailed it. He displayed greed, love, ambivalence, and even honor. He was magnificent and I never even once honed in on the accent.<br/><br/>Hounsou was equally wonderful. He delivered his role with such emotion and such believability that you'd swear that he was reliving an event he'd experienced before. In fact, it was the acting of DiCaprio and Hounsou that triggered most of the various emotions I felt while watching Blood Diamond. I say most of the emotions because the camera work and excellent directing to depict the despair of the African people triggered the rest of the despondent feelings I had.<br/><br/>This movie successfully captured the plight of a people and the plight of one man, all the while seamlessly tying in other ancillary interests and conflicts, such as that of Danny Archer (DiCaprio), Maddy Bowen (Connelly), and other characters who were driven solely by greed. This movie was riveting, relevant, very hard hitting, and just gushing with excellence. I was told of this movie's merit and also duly warned because it is not for the faint of heart. But I'd say that the way that this movie was done was necessary in order to avoid belittling an otherwise great and tremendous issue. There was really no other way to impact the audience without the intense scenes and intense drama that was shown. This movie heaped one heavy hearted scene upon another, pushing the audience to the brink and testing our fortitude and resilience. Would we turn away to avoid a stark reality and continue to live happily ever after because ignorance is bliss. Or would we watch so that we can be apprised of what is going on outside of our safe confines and how it in fact has to do with our way of life. Yes, our fancies and indiscretions do affect lives outside of the Western world.<br/><br/>As an African-American I felt especially obliged to watch Blood Diamond, and I felt especially saddened by what I saw. And I would be remiss if I didn't cite the most memorable line to me, and that is when Solomon Vandy said: <br/><br/>""I understand White people want our diamonds, yes. But how can my own people do this to each other?"""

For instance, that shirt made in Korea, or your game system made in Japan, or how about that diamond ring found in Africa.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond is the story of a smuggler, an African native and a journalist in the country of Sierra Leone at a time of Civil War. By the first ten minutes of this film, we know how violent it's going to get when a Rebel Group of fighters, the RUF, come into a village and terrorize it's peaceful citizen. What do these guys want. Strong abled bodies to do their Diamond Mining. What about the rest of the people. Kill them.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou is Solomon Vandy, one of the villagers that the rebels have taken hostage. He is forced to mine for Diamonds. While on the job, he stumbles upon a huge 100 karat Diamond. He buries the diamond as the area is being secured by armed forces against the RUF.<br/><br/>Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a diamond smuggler who finds Solomon while in a jail house. He hears that Solomon has found a priceless Diamond and comes up with a plan to use Solomon to get that diamond. He offers to help find Solomon's family.<br/><br/>Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is a journalist looking for a story to expose the Diamond Scheme to the First World Nations. She wants Archers story.<br/><br/>The film is a violent adventure that exposes the real life violence in Africa because of US consumer needs. Leonardo DiCarprio (Nominated for Oscar)gives an awesome performance despite his accent. Jennifer Connelly gives a convincing performance as Maddy Brown, she is everything; Sexy, Sensitive, Brave and Smart all at once. The best performance of the movie goes to Djimon Hounsou(Nominated for Best Supporting Actor,) the refugee searching for his family. Above all, we want to see his character come out on top.<br/><br/>The villains in this film are deep and we really hate them because they are, plain and simple, bad dudes you don't want to mess with. They will stop at nothing, including having children kill innocent people.<br/><br/>Once again, the film is violent, but this kind of film has to be violent to get it's point across. The reality of this country is violent, it is gruesome and yet the western world closes their eyes and soaks up the benefits."

","BLOOD DIAMOND is a fast paced action/drama that deals with the real truth about diamonds in Africa: that they are sometimes obtained using some of the most ruthless methods and with little regard for human rights. This is the story of Danny Archer, a diamond bounty hunter who during a brief stay in jail meets Solomon Vandy, a black ""slave"" worker who apparently finds a large, precious diamond in the diamond digging site, and buries it so no one else can get it. Archer, anxious to know if Solomon indeed has access to this diamond, pays his bail in order to get to the diamond. In the process, Archer meets Maddy Bowen, an American journalist determined to expose the diamond trade's dirty laundry. Maddy needs Archer's inside scoop about the diamond trade, Archer needs the hidden diamond to escape from Africa and Solomon wants to get his family back. All 3 main character's want something desperately and it's the diamond that holds them together. This is an interesting movie about a subject most of us probably only heard once on CNN or read something about it in NAT GEO. It's sad to see this brutal trade still goes on in the 21st century so in this respect, the movie also succeeds in raising awareness about the subject. <br/><br/>Just as a note, it's kind of funny how most movies about Africa only deal with dark subjects, either about this bloody diamond trade, or about ruthless dictators (LAST KING OF Scotland), or pure and simple mayhem (BLACK HAWK DOWN). It's a wonder if Africa has a blooming tourism industry! Di Caprio's performance as Archer is amongst his best. Jennifer Connely is also good, but a bit underused, and Djimon Hounsou is simply unbelievable. I don't think it will be too long for him to get an Oscar. All in all, and movie worth seeing again!"

"shanfloyd","8","0","1","10 April 2007"," Brutal... both in violence and honesty.
","'Blood Diamond' is another typical example of a class of Hollywood movies that makes you sick but you cannot leave the theatre until they end. The film gruesomely portrays the social aspects of civil war in so-called third-world countries... child soldiers, slavery, prostitution, political corruption at their best. The opportunistic standpoint of the Western developed nations in such matters is also delicately pointed out. And all these are brilliantly done with the help of three totally different characters: a poor fisherman in Sierra Leone who accidentally finds a large diamond in the conflict mines, a tough ""white trash"" smuggler of conflict diamonds and a no-nonsense American journalist whose primary goal is to sell a good story.<br/><br/>The film is extremely well-acted. Leonardo DiCaprio again effectively sheds off his boyish charm in this tough criminal role of smuggler Archer and his Academy Award nomination is hundred percent justified. Jennifer Connelly did not receive the best dialogues, I must say, but she does a pretty believable job in this rather tomboyish role. But it's Djimon Hounsou who steals the show with his extremely passionate portrayal of the fisherman Solomon Vandy. Solomon is a rather complex character and it's wonderful to watch Hounsou's take on him, especially at that scene when he finally bursts out in the end when violence was constantly imposed upon him. May he receive more complex roles in future projects.<br/><br/>The screenplay, though wonderful to express the true situation of African civil war, appears exaggerated at times (e.g. the child soldier points his AK47 to Archer in the car and shouts ""Who is this motherf---er?""). Some dialogues appear a tad too dramatic. The story suddenly seemed to rush right after the diamond was found in the end. Edward Zwick is an excellent director and we all love his works but here he fails to develop a new style of storytelling. All the scenes of violence and torture are just usually graphic and without any originality.<br/><br/>Still, this is one of the best films to come out in 2006... because somehow it's very honest. It doesn't exaggerate any of the characters. It does not take a stand to glorify one particular nation. 'Blood Diamond' must be an eye-opener to many filmmakers who often shout out morals in their films."

","Solomon (Hounsou)a fisherman turned diamond miner for the rebels in Sierra Leone finds and hides a Blood Diamond (also known as Pink). Danny Archer (DiCaprio), a diamond smuggler knows Solomon hid the diamond. The two must work together to achieve their very different goals. <br/><br/>I thought I had seen enough movies where violence and sheer killing madness ruled, but I was not prepared for this one. It is the most violent I have ever seen, but consider this: the choreography of such killings was outstanding. That is a terrible thing to say, but when you see what is going on, everything flowed like poetry. You couldn't help but notice that. That director gave us a sense of something we should never see, or hear about. It was like I was there and I kept hoping it would all stop and never start again. You keep asking yourself how could human beings act this way and I am talking about the rebels in Sierra Leone in the late 1990s. These things really did happen and most of the world knew nothing about them. Now, get this: the rebels recruited young boys to do much of the killing too. Solomon's son was one of them. The story is fiction, but the events in Sierra Leone, at that time, were very real.<br/><br/>I know The Departed won the Oscar for Best Picture, but I would have given it to this movie. All in all, the production, and the acting was a cut above everything else. DiCaprio is in a league of his own and he makes all the others in the cast better. There is no other way to say it even at his young age. Yes, he came up with a Rhodesian South African accent and that was fine. Marlon Brando did much the same thing with accents dependent on what was needed for the story. DiCaprio also did a New Jersey accent in The Departed. It worked. <br/><br/>The movie is long but never drags. When it looks like it may slow down, here comes a gang of rebels or soldier children in jeeps killing everything in sight. At the end of the movie a notice says that today Sierra Leone is quiet, but that there are still 200,000 soldier children. That's still scary. <br/><br/>The movie itself and the director Edward Zwick should have been nominated and they weren't. DiCaprio was nominated for Best Actor and that's something, but not good enough. Do the nominations have to be limited to five? <br/><br/>Violence: Yes,Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: Yes"

","OK, first the positives. The acting is great. Dicaprio is very, very good as are the other main characters. The cinematography is rich and wondrous. There is action. The characters are interesting. And, as everyone knows before entering the theater or renting the movie, there is going to be plenty of violence. And yes, the violence is handled with skill. It is movie violence. They do not show the head getting crushed with a shovel, you only see it coming and hear the sound.<br/><br/>Even the title is great. So many levels of meaning. Diamonds and bloodshed, wedded. Oh yes, and that rock you get your sweetheart when you get wedded, might have been bought with blood. And what is a ""blood diamond""? It is large, it is hard, it is precious. It is hidden and valuable. It is a metaphor for many things and one thing. Rosebud. A rose is a rose is a rose.<br/><br/>So what's wrong with this movie? Why isn't it working for me? Why do I keep wanting to fast forward? The answers to these questions reveal the movie's fundamental weakness. Is it because I just don't care about the characters? That's part of it. The greater problem is that the quantity of close escapes, improbable escapes, improbable re-unions, impossible situations that you really have to stop caring whether this story could really happen or not.<br/><br/>Dicaprio is superhero and anti-hero. Spiderman with an attitude. No matter how many times he encounters armies of rebels with AK-47s, missiles and the like, he and his sidekick always dodge the bullets and glide away.<br/><br/>And so, you fast forward. You really don't care HOW they get away, and you already know that they will, so what is the big whoop? Fast forward.<br/><br/>Then there is the improbable with regard to African jungles. Are there really no bugs, no snakes, no crocs in the river, no predatory beasts? And where do they sleep? I get tired traveling on a business trip for four days, eating well, sleeping in comfortable beds. These people run through the jungle, sleep on the ground, get up and climb mountains, fight battles. And they never need caffeine. They are superheroes. Bigger than life.<br/><br/>The plot is predictable. You know he will find his family. You know he will find his son again. You already know Africa is a bad, bad place, and that it is the fault of the Colonializers.<br/><br/>Alas, the director created some beautiful cinematography, but like Peter Jackson's King Kong, there were too many scenes that went way too long. My speculation is that these directors spend so much time and money creating a set, setting up the shoot, that they don't have the good sense to put a lot of what is shot onto the cutting room floor. They fall in love with what they created, whether it is relevant or not. I think here of Chinatown by way of contrast. A scene does not have to include everything that happens. The bedroom scene with Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson has parts of the beginning of an encounter, parts of the aftermath, and leaves the rest to the imagine. The goal of the scene is to move the story forward. Instead, in movies like King Kong and Blood Diamond, the aim of the scene is The Scene. To make it and milk it.<br/><br/>Great films are about story, and Hollywood all too often forgets this. Blood Diamond could have been a better film. Most of the elements are actually there. The actors certainly gave it their best and performed admirably. In the end, though, the film felt too much like a Hollywood cliché."

","Why was THIS not nominated for Best Picture and Best Screenplay? Easily the best film I've seen all year, if not for several years, and I AM a picky moviegoer. First of all, the script was truly excellent. The plot worked, the characters were real and 3-dimentsional, and the interplay between the three main characters made the whole thing really spark. Added to that, the acting was first-rate throughout: not just the leads but ALL the characters. Secondly, I loved that the movie makers were unafraid to show what really went on in Sierra Leone at that time. The child soldier parts were harsh, but you owe it to yourself to see this. The cinematography was excellent, and the juxtaposition of such beautiful scenery as a background to horrific events served well to highlight just how shocking the atrocities there really were. This was one of the few films I watched again the next day, and picked up lots of small parts I'd missed the first time round (minor nit: some of the actors mutter a bit a times, so you can easily miss things people say) - but you'll want to watch it a second time anyway. The parts I wanted to come back to the most were always to do with the interplay between the characters. An excellent, excellent film."

","Blood Diamond was the best film i saw in 2006. The storyline was engrossing and addictive and the action sequences were timely and authentic. DiCaprio was stunning as always. He has really developed into the best actor in Hollywood and rarely seems to star in a bad movie these days.<br/><br/>His portrayal of Danny Archer as the bad good guy, was brilliant. Right down to his seamless South African accent (although his character is from Rhodesia i think?).<br/><br/>Guys, take your girlfriend to see this movie and she will soon grow to detest the diamond trade and totally understand when you propose to her with a cubic zirconium!!!

","One can only hope that the message being spelled out in this movie is one that will actually hit home to a few people in the major diamond consuming countries of the world, DeBeers is evil. Having had the chance to actually meet a few children who had been mutilated by the R.U.F. it was a difficult thing for me to watch the actual process of forced amputation but i think depicting it in this film was a necessary evil meant to shock and move those that watched it. The biggest let down for me was DiCaprio, i happen to think that he is a very versatile actor but in this film i think the south African accent was a little out of his league, he seems to change from Australian to Scottish to Irish to English without warning. Not implying that i could possibly do any better but it ain't my job to fake an accent. overall i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good action movie with a reasonably interesting plot."
"kctotal","9","0","1","25 March 2007"," An Interesting Approach to the Blood Diamond Industry
","2006 floundered with brilliant politically motivated flicks. Now with 2007 just beginning to blossom, Blood Diamond can call itself the first proper and serious movie of the year.<br/><br/>Solomon lives a normal life, working as a fisherman, but when his family is taken away by the rebel forces, his life is dramatically changed. His fate gets worse when he discovers a huge diamond, which is desired by everyone. In the meantime, a professional diamond smuggler learns about the diamond and bargains with Solomon that he will help him find his family in exchange for the diamond's whereabouts. Also joining the small traveling duo is an American journalist desperately searching for some information about the blood diamond industry.<br/><br/>In a film featuring three Oscar-nominated actors and two for the film itself, Blood Diamond cannot help, but benefit from its stunning performances. At the helm is Leonardo DiCaprio, who develops a South-African accent, and gives his most mature and yet touching performance to date. Another worthy performer is Djimon Hounsou, who has been previously seen in a brief role in the remarkable ""The Island"". His performance is brave and despite the fact that the viewer may not side for him for most of the film, one can still feel his pain and suffering. Unfortunately, the understated Jennifer Connelly, isn't given as ample screen tome, as her fellow actors. She is very convincing as a journalist who truly cares about what is happening in these nations. Other actors who occasionally pop in aren't unwelcome either.<br/><br/>Despite having a very dramatic subject, the film still allows itself a series of breathtaking and entirely engaging sequence, which vary from wild street shootouts to an explosion in a diamond mine. These frequent scenes are handled with ease and the actors easily transmit their emotions even in these adrenalin pumped sequences. Some seem out of place, but in my opinion they help this film become a rather exciting feature rather than a two-hour long lecture. The only problem with these scenes is that they are not given a Hollywood touch, but are confined to some endless blind shooting by the rebels and the government. Blood flows like water, and corpses linger around every corner.<br/><br/>Finally, I also applaud the movie for its ability to tug at a few heartstrings every now and then. Teens and adults who are not aware of what is happening are urged to see this film as it raises many important issues which aren't normally tackled in such a manner. It is isn't enough to make you feel the dirt rubbing against your diamond-laden fingers, but is enough to make think twice before buying a diamond which has been imported from Africa. In fact, the audience shall be shocked to see children chanting war raves, and shooting mercilessly at innocent and helpless civilians which simply want to get on with their normal lives.<br/><br/>Verdict What could have been a long and tiring documentary about the troubles in Sierra Leone is turned into a star-powered vehicle with raises some very important issues. Smart, searing and seemingly ruthless, this is a must-see if not for its laid back action sequences."
"digmovies","10","0","1","24 March 2007"," DiCaprio's Best
","An absolute knock-out on all accounts. Blood Diamond takes a heartbreaking story, and masterfully crafts it into a captivating and emotionally impacting motion picture.<br/><br/>Personally, not being a fan of Edward Zwick I was quickly anxious to see what he's done with his cast. Thankfully, I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio just keeps getting better. He will quickly build up a resumé that won't be matched. Danny Archer is the character of charm and wit that everyone admires. Though, our admiration as viewers will be somewhat diminished as the true nature of the character is revealed.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou is remarkable, and well deserving of an Academy Award. It would be late to say, that Alan Arkin did not match the intensity and conviction that Mr. Hounsou has brought upon us.<br/><br/>Viewers will sympathize with everyone, not in terms of their actual personality, but more from the realism which is brought by an all-star cast. Not often am I terrified by what I've seen on screen, and yet Edward Zwick tells the story through his vision.<br/><br/>The murders, shooting, and destruction are a symbol of evil that we are unaware of. The diamond corporation is revolved around beauty and glamor, but the origins of these stones go unrecognized by nearly everyone.<br/><br/>In terms of relevance, Blood Diamond takes the honor. It takes the honor and smashes it over every single Best Picture nominee. The fact that this film was excluded is a sin, and a crime at the least. Are the majority of film goers claiming Little Miss Sunshine to surpass the mastery of Blood Diamond? Is Scorsese's gangster film worthy of the title on surpassing this? The answer is simply, ""no"" but it does bring up interesting questions. Blood Diamond may have a more personal connection rather than targeting the general population. I mean no offense for the previous films, but if it is a connection aspect, then yes Blood Diamond is far superior based upon my own opinions.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Blood Diamond, rent it or buy it immediately. There won't be a film to match this caliber for decades.<br/><br/>This is the greatest motion picture of 2006, and if based on personal connection, a Best Picture victory would have been deserving."

Instead of Sidney Poitier we have Djimon Hounsou as the poor noble man looking for his wife & children & instead of Maureen O' Hara we have Jennifer Connelly as the intrepid reporter.,Granted my 3 names from the past never made a film together, But this film has all the same ingredients, Instead of a false ,phony story way back then, we have a more vital truthful story here..<br/><br/>The villains are still the same only this time more realistically vicious.<br/><br/>In fact the only thing missing is a free-for all barroom brawl.

THis is a long film 143 minutes, If I were to be picky I would state the the last 15 minutes before the credits began to roll,were very slow moving. The first 130 or so minutes moved at a rapid pace.<br/><br/>As much as I loved the older movies of my youth,the stores they told were very juvenile on most cases.

Of Course my friends didn't know who i was talking about, but i told them who i meant.<br/><br/>In January i turned out do be right. He became nominated for best actor in a supporting role. I am telling you this, because the reason why I actually saw this movie in the theater's is, that Djimon did NOT win the Oscar. So i wanted to know, for what reason they did not give him that award.<br/><br/>Two days after the Academy Awards i went to the cinema and watched the movie with my girlfriend. She is an actress and i am a screenwriter.<br/><br/>After about ninety minutes i said to my girlfriend. F*** departed, F*** babel, this is the best motion picture of the year. I mean it is so important. And its REAL. That is why it is so important.<br/><br/>When the movie was over, i remained motionless for about ten minutes. i never did that before. But i just could not stop crying.<br/><br/>When we were leaving the theater's i said to my girlfriend. I can certainly see, why Leonardo did not win the Oscar for best Actor in a leading role. Djimon should have. I mean, i cannot possibly think for any reason, why Djimon's character is supposed to be a supporting character.<br/><br/>Now i can only give you the advise to go an watch that movie. That is all i can do.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>I want to add something, and i want you to know i added it. Last week i saw Blood Diamond the second time and - I don't know what to say, it is just amazing. Until 90th minute i didn't rellay watch the movie, i just listend to the dialogue cause i was doing something else. At the end, at some point i realized that i was crying. I did'nt even notice when i started to cry. This story, these characters are so intense.

","""Blood Diamond""  Rated R, C<br/><br/>""Blood Diamond"" is one of the most confusing movies I've seen in quite some time. I can't say that I enjoyed it or hated it. Some parts are brilliant, but others are preachy and predictable.<br/><br/>There are too many stories within the film to describe. It might be easier to list what I consider the main themes of the film, most of which are universal: · Parents want a better life for their kids. · Individuals are greedy, but governments are greedier. · Redemption is always possible. · Dire circumstances force people to perform unlikely actions to survive. · People will trade whatever they have for whatever they want. <br/><br/>In late 1990s Sierra Leone, the main commodity is diamonds. Rebels coerce the locals into sifting through the muddy river to get them. If they do, they get to live. If not, they don't. It's that simple. But one man (Djimon Hounsou) sees a way out of the refugee camps for himself and his family when he finds a large diamond, which he then steals and buries.<br/><br/>After getting arrested, he gets accused of stealing the diamond but there's no proof. Fortunately (or maybe not) there just happens to be a diamond smuggler (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the other cell. After springing him, the smuggler offers to find the missing family in exchange for the diamond. After exhausting any legal possible alternatives, the two join forces.<br/><br/>The other integral part of this trio is an American journalist (Jennifer Connelly). After her initial fishing attempts are rebuffed, she decides to give her aide to the pair in exchange for proof of the story that she knows is there.<br/><br/>But this was where I started to get confused. What was the main point of the film? I can't even classify it  is it a drama, an action film, a political statement, or something else? I understood that Africa is a very chaotic place and that anything can happen at any time. Maybe I just didn't get it.<br/><br/>The scenes that affected me the most didn't have anything to do with the main characters  it had to do with the training of children. One scene in particular hit me  a child is blindfolded, given a machine gun and then told to shoot. He does, but what's he's not told is that an adult will be thrown in front of him, who is obviously killed. The look on his face made me feel more than any speech of dialogue in the whole film.<br/><br/>At one point, Connelly's character is typing a story. She remarks that whatever she types won't make a difference. That maybe, if she's lucky, it may convince someone to write a check.<br/><br/>I can't help thinking that if this film wasn't quite as fragmented, it could have made some solid point  even if I'm not exactly sure what it would have been."
"Pingo-2","6","0","3","13 March 2007"," Sloppy production of important subjects.
","You can't really say that the producers of this film are as much heroes as the film's characters. Leonardo DiCaprio is doing one of his best roles, and is great as the diamond-hungry smuggler from Rhodesia. Djimon Hounsou is equally marvelous as the family father who just happened to find the largest diamond in the world.<br/><br/>The story revolves around conflict diamonds, large business conspiracies and child soldiers. Most of it is created from true stories. But some stuff that are extremely important to lift forward (like that the price of diamonds are kept up by a cartel) are just mentioned quickly.<br/><br/>Likewise, the ending is soft and tacky. Don't be fooled to think that this is an African movie depicting Africa, Sierra Leone or any other African country or place, in its right way. This is purely Hollywood speaking, and it has nothing to do with anything but selling a product to a domestic audience.<br/><br/>This comes evidently clear when you hear the hip-hop for the first time. Why is it that all films with black actors HAS to have hip-hop music - just because there are black people in the film? If Hollywood wanted to stay free from racial slurs, then they should try to re-think their productions a bit more. BLOOD DIAMOND have many of these almost racist characterizations, and that doesn't give these tough and important subjects justice.<br/><br/>But even though the producers are cowards, and the PR-people stupid fat white men, the rest of the film is quite nicely done. It could have been more violent though, since watching a war movie without blood feels like watching a TV-film from the 1960:s.<br/><br/>The movie itself has a very nice script, the locations are great and the actors are mostly very good. The director tries hard, and gives us as much as he's allowed to show. The producers, though, should probably try to produce children movies in the future and stay clear of hard subjects. Some people just doesn't have the guts for the real thing."

I have to agree with a previous reviewer, and say this is the finest film of the year. Although I have no complaints with the other successes at the awards. I am surprised that Djimon Hounsou did not receive recognition for his performance and thought he was the most 'sure thing' for an award since Benico Del Toro for Traffic.

","Blood Diamond is a compelling dramatization of events in Sierra Leone in the late '90s concerning ""conflict diamonds"" that are used to finance war in African regions. Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou are fine as the smuggler and fisherman who reluctantly team up to achieve their own goals of survival and destination. Jennifer Connelly has the more difficult role of a reporter who explains what info she needs and serves as something of a romantic interest for DiCaprio but thankfully something tragic happens before it could come to fruition... Hounsou is especially good when he finds nearly all of his family except for his most cherished child: his son. And the accent and weariness of DiCaprio's character shows how far he's gone in prominence since his heartthrob days in Titanic. Both got well deserved Oscar nominations (though I think DiCaprio's should have been in the other film he made that year: Martin Scorsese's The Departed). Director Edward Zwick, best known for TV's ""Thirtysomething"" and ""Once and Again"", brings a compelling pace throughout. Well recommended for anyone interested in the events this movie depicts."

It is actually a touching story about a man who's son was captured by an African rebel group known as the RUF, and that man's struggle to find him.

Not much emotional gravitas for Connelly here, maybe a good cry after some loss and even some appealing feminine foxiness in her part as a photo journalist. Again, expected but something always worth noting with Jennifer Connelly.<br/><br/>The surprise IS DiCaprio manages to pull off an adequately intense and gallant portrayal as the Briton/smuggler/journalist on the quest for the big piece. Zwick does a decent job as well, and I particularly liked the juxtapousition of scenes in the beginning when violence and exploitation is carried out in the jungles.... and it is merely being talked about in a cozy, comfortable conference room. Third World. First World. And also one of the end scenes where DiCaprio phones Connelly from the warm, blazing warzone; while the latter is in a cruise ship with cooler or colder colors.

Such movies are nice to see after a long time, it reminded me of Indiana Jones series, a power packed adventure drama. Only addition this time is that the narrative has more violence in it.<br/><br/>Without mentioning the director  Edward Zwick in the beginning of my review, I would be doing disservice. Edward Zwick has punched in enough commercial delight with a human rights (that's what I heard on TV!?) message. Yes, he touches the fringes of critical issues that tingles the mind. The movie casually makes philosophical, political, economic and a few cynical statements especially against American life and thinking. But that does not stop the director to carve out his narrative out of the Hollywood style of story telling.<br/><br/>The setting is epic  in the backdrop of Sierra Leone diamond mines and rebel war lords who fight inhumanly for getting a few more diamonds. The story is about Djimon Hounson who finds and hides a big diamond; Leonardo in pursue of the diamond joins hand with Djimon  who now wants to go back to his land to find his son. Jennifer Connelly is a journalist (so typical!!) in search for an expose to illegal diamond trade, who develops a love bond with Leonardo and helps him at crucial juncture.<br/><br/>But let me tell you that the story is bit over-stretched, and linking all child soldiers to diamond trade is untrue. Nor the persistent violence of such a heavy shooting and killings on the streets exists amidst environment of normal life. But this is a commercial format  and I think such liberties are permissible.<br/><br/>The movie is well made  and scores high on every department of movie making techniques  cinematography, actions, sets, music and above all acting. Leonardo is great, Djimon is terrific and Jennifer is 'American'!! I think the credit of bringing out this story and screenplay should be given to Charles Leavitt, who successfully blends good story (like a typical epic action novel) in a commercial format. There are softer moments in the film, that dwells into and touches intense global issues  but I thought that it fell one or two notches short of hitting bulls eye.<br/><br/>If you like Leonardo, go and see the movie  you will love him. And even if you do not like Leonardo, but like good commercial movies go and see the movie, you will like it.<br/><br/>(6.5 Stars)"

","It's gotta be said, Leo Di Caprio has the best Agent in Hollywood right now. After a brilliant performance in The Departed, which was also a brilliant film, he keeps the pace with Blood Diamond.<br/><br/>The story is pretty basic -- two African men; Solomen Vandy (black poverity stricken pan handler) & Danny Archer (ex white soldier now diamond smuggler), from opposite ends of society are forced to help each other out, in search of a priceless diamond that was hidden by Solomen -- when the gang he worked for were caught up in the chaos of a civil war skirmish.<br/><br/>Some of this film is beyond gritty, it attempts to portray typical events that occurred in the late 90's Sierra Leone civil war. The angle and the camera shots, the colours, the shock-factor probably stretch further than City of God. If the director wanted the viewer to be gripped, he achieved this.<br/><br/>I'm glad to say for a big-budget, typically marketed movie, it rarely gives any flaws in the script, no cheese, no pointless feel-good humour that is sometimes peppered on a class films such as Ocean's 11, Three Kings, for example -- but maybe they're a bad comparison? The main cast were very believable, Leo's ""South Africaaan"" accent was spot on, he has become a man. It must have been The Departed that helped shed his boyish charm and allowed him to grow into the league of big players like Robert De Niro, and I'm not exaggerating -- his performance equals a good De Niro film.<br/><br/>The babe of the film -- Jennifer Connolley I think she served this story well. Looks a little like Courtney Cox but healthier, then there's the Solomen character, who we've never heard of; Djimon Hounsou. He was spot on too. The only thing I may have changed, would've been Archer's old mentor  the Colonel. I didn't feel that character was exploited enough. But whatever..<br/><br/>If you've not checked this film out yet, then you almost definitely should.<br/><br/>~Paul Browne."
"come2whereimfrom","6","0","2","2 February 2007"," OK action film
","The latest Leonardo outing is based on some facts but also contains some fiction. Set in 1999 against the backdrop of the bitter rebel fighting in Africa it tells the tale of how the exporting of illegal diamonds funds the fighting that is wiping out thousands of Africans and making even more homeless. Leo plays Danny Archer ex-soldier turned diamond smuggler and all round wheeler dealer and hard man, along with a reporter played by Jennifer Connelly and a local desperate to be reunited with his family they embark on a journey to recover a diamond big enough to get Connelly her story and Danny out of the imploding country. With rebels and the corrupt army also in pursuit there is enough action to keep the film moving along at a fair old pace and with some great performances the overall film is OK. One thing I didn't like was Leo's South African accent and all I could think about was the boss of Dante fires from 'Alan Partridge' and at times he does border on comical. The camera work on the fighting and set pieces is reminiscent of 'Black Hawk Down' with whizzing bullets and showers of debris which draws you in with the intensity of the action. Dimjoi Houston clearly has a chance at the best supporting actor Oscar as he gives such a passionate performance from start to finish. There are a few obvious bits of plot but also a few not so obvious that lead the viewer in a different direction than expected. But from what clearly starts off as a friendship due to the money at stake it does turn slightly towards the end and veers a bit to close to an ebony and ivory buddy romp through the jungle, that said I did enjoy the film not fully polished but by no means a rough diamond."
"radu-balanescu","6","0","1","1 February 2007"," Better than average but no more than good acting
","********** *SPOILERS* **********<br/><br/>I just saw this movie yesterday evening and I must admit that I was expecting more. I can't deny that Leondardo DiCaprio does a great job and perhaps deserves his Oscar nomination, although his other great performance in The Departed must have its part in this nomination. If I had to choose between his two performances I would chose Danny Archer as the better, probably because of the more challenging task he had to achieve. I must admit that Archer's final moments, and his sarcasm until the last moment, are irresistible and after making you laugh will most likely send some shivers down your spine. <br/><br/>Mr. Hounsou also has a great appearance with a difficult part, a more sensible one, mostly meant to point out the changes in Archer's feelings. Jennifer Connelly's part is quite a small one and to be frank it didn't impress me at all.<br/><br/>All good until now but when you bring into subject the theme and the script, well I must say that it has its lacks. The subject itself is a touching one, one that should make people ask themselves again if money is the only thing that mattered these days and if it is worth a human's life. We all agree that tragic events happen everywhere and it is no secret that children are being abused in ways we can't even dare to imagine. But why combine all this tragedies with a Rambo type of movie? I am sick of characters that throw themselves in the middle of the battle, bullets flying around, rockets exploding everywhere and our character shoots everyone around just like in an action computer game. I admit that the point was to show that no one cared about those people but it could have found a better way of showing that without making such an incredible hero out of Archer. After all he is human and we all realize that the chances were greater of him getting himself killed in that moment than taking a bullet in the scene where he kills colonel Coetzee. <br/><br/>The brilliant and all knowing bad guy that eventually turns into an emotional savior of the weak is a much used theme and this picture doesn't bring anything new to the subject. We are all sorry for Archer but in the end you have to ask yourself whether he wouldn't have killed Solomon and his kid if he hadn't been shot. Maybe he would, maybe he wouldn't. There was definitely a struggle inside him but his wound had the decisive part in taking the decision.<br/><br/>I realize that the movie was about Africa and the tortures its inhabitants suffer every day and that Archer was only a mean of showing that. The ending suggests that but it leaves us wondering if anything could really be done for those people. Money will always matter more and just like that black guy said, let's hope they don't find oil there. <br/><br/>All in all I think they could have found a better way of telling the story. I really liked the sceneries and some scenes made me think of lord of the rings, the friendship between frodo and Sam, the beginning of their journey and the way Sam carried frodo to the top of mount doom. Anther scene I enjoyed was the one during the road to kono (if I remember well the name) when all those reporters rushed to take pictures and shoot the dead people in the middle of the road. We are no longer impressed by the suffering, we are just trying to sell the better story. It's just about the money or the fame, isn't it?"
"dunmore_ego","7","0","1","24 January 2007"," A Rough in the Diamond
","The greed of the human animal is such a compelling thing that even decrying that greed will only feed it. Such is the paradox facing Edward Zwick's powerful *Blood Diamond*, a movie set in the west African country of Sierra Leone in 1999, when Revolutionary United Front rebels took over the nation's capital, using diamonds mined by slave labor as their civil war sledgehammer, to finance their war against the government.<br/><br/>Though it is against the horrors perpetrated by the rebels and their leveraging of ""blood diamonds,"" the movie recreates their atrocities so well that it will rake in millions on the depiction of those atrocities.<br/><br/>Audiences have recently given Mel Gibson grief over the gratuitous bloodletting in his movies, yet when *Blood Diamond* blasts into a shattering killing euphoria every twenty minutes almost on cue, do those same critics hold their tongues because *Diamond* supposedly portrays a real conflict? Written by Charles Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell, we are shown boys recruited by the RUF, armed with AK-47s, mindlessly blowing away citizens, we see arms being lopped off, sudden shootings in the head and wild slayings of innocents; knowledge of the Sierra Leone civil conflict might lend a context to the violence, but its acceptance as an ostensible necessary element in this movie says something about our violent species. Is Gibson's violence gratuitous because it depicts societies far removed from our modern world, and is *Diamond*'s violence ""noble"" because it is just across the pond? Like Mel's *Apocalypto*, we are witness to a people destroying themselves from within. Over greed.<br/><br/>Slinking beneath the radar of the turmoil is diamond smuggler, Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio). For this role, Leo does what most women do who want to be taken seriously  women like George Michael, Ashton Kutcher and Joey Fatone  he grows a goatee. It doesn't help. He's still as pretty as sunset on the French Riviera. But he's hard - the hardest he's ever played: shooting down guerrillas in cold blood, breaking necks, facing down gun-toting madmen, all in a shirt so grimy with his back-sweat that it probably brought a lunatic's price on e-bay from some squealing tweener. In fact, he's so hard that if they were to remake *Titanic* today, he'd play the iceberg.<br/><br/>Though his career performances have been consistently stellar, in burying himself in the role of this Rhodesian-born, white African, through a reasonably legit South African accent (and that badass goatee), for the first time, we lose the sense that we are watching a Movie Star; it could be just some guy pretty enough to be Leo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou is Solomon Vandy, a fisherman whose teen son, Dia (Kagiso Kuypers), is kidnapped and brainwashed by the rebels, *a la* Patty Hearst. While Dia is trained to smoke, drink and mow down villagers every bit as mindlessly as a good ole U.S. Marine, Solomon is enslaved by the rebels to dig for diamonds, one day unearthing a pink rock the size of Freedom  which he hides.<br/><br/>In true mercenary style, Archer hooks up with Solomon, promising to help retrieve Solomon's son in return for a part of the diamond. (In an unintentionally funny scene, skinny white-boy Leo asserts he will set the pace cross-country  with a mandingo like Djimon at his side.) Archer brings along smart-mouth American journalist, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly  blessed with the scriptwriter's snappy repartee that no female ever employs in real life), who is also a merc, offering to help them in return for Archer providing her vital black market info that will make her exposé on blood diamonds pop. So she has no call to give Archer a contemptuous look when she discovers why he is helping Solomon  but in true Female Double Standard idiom, we are meant to forgive Maddy *her* merc intentions for her doe eyes and half-exposed teats.<br/><br/>Still, though both start out as mercs, Maddy and Archer's characters eventually bow down to the god of Hollywood Character Arcs, both finding their inner Oprahs before the credits roll.<br/><br/>Keeping the lovebirds apart in the final few minutes, the film might have retained even more cred had it not made them so freakin' HONORABLE. We humans are a gruesome, violent species - watch the screaming satisfaction of Solomon smashing a shovel over his slaver's head. More than a few people enjoyed that scene with their hands down their pants, me included.<br/><br/>During boardroom scenes (populated by suits pretending concern for the blood spilled over illicit diamonds) we learn of The Kimberley Process, a joint government and diamond industry initiative working to staunch the flow of ""conflict diamonds."" But who's buying this lip service? There is greed up and down the ladder, from the CEOs to the governments, to the rebels and precious stone customers.<br/><br/>And though the movie is supposedly an indictment against this black market bingo, I doubt Leo's goatee, Jennifer's teats or Djimon's mandingo will influence real world buyers into only purchasing ""conflict-free"" gems.<br/><br/>Trying to blow the lid off the illicit diamond trade, Maddy asserts, ""People back home wouldn't buy a ring if they knew it was gonna cost a hand."" Wrong. The type of people who insist on diamonds as presents, who think nothing of terrorizing a man into surrendering three months' salary to placate them with trinkets, hail from a sickly society whose voracious greed ensures blindness regarding methods of procurement. Besides their industrial abrasive and conductivity properties, diamonds are non-utilitarian status symbols, in the general community only serving to make her bleary-eyed and open-thighed upon receipt.<br/><br/>Guess that's all the utility we need."

","A fine movie about the problematic situation in Sierra Leone - a strong depiction of the creation of child soldiers and their brainwashing process which makes children hate their parents. The brutality of the civil war is explicitly depicted through the presence of the great actors especially the actor who plays the African fisherman bent on searching for his lost son.The end of the movie is inevitably moralistic notwithstanding that a lot of double-crossing and treason has been depicted during the duration of the film both among native Africans and white colonizers and soldiers of fortune.The triumph of morality in the ends comes after such a display of treason and duplicity that it does not have the required cathartic effect."

","I went to see this movie with some reservations, as I am not to crazy about Leonardo DiCaprio in any of his roles since Titanic. I should have followed my instincts so I sat through this 2 plus hours movie. The outstanding job of acting was by Djimon Hounson who played the role of the fisherman who found the blood diamond and spent the great part of the picture trying to reunite with his family. Jennifer Connelly was good in her role and pleasure to look at. My recommendation to you is to pass this one by or if you have to see it, wait for the film to come out on DVD which should be shortly.

It's nice to see a movie that shows what is really going on in Africa. Leo's accent seems too sentimental for the brunette he's always wanted and could never conquer without kissing up. It was a touchy subject that used mystification to handle and made it up there with Leo's most excellent performances. It was Jennifer Connelly's best!!! Compelling scenery deserving of Leo's fight and my vote for outstanding lead male. It was good that he didn't try to conquer her and supported her talent. It was filmed as if they didn't even know it and Leo acted like he just wanted his pillow. When he does win his Oscar I hope he knocks on my door to bust me out. i'm crazy about him!!!"

"greer453","Null","0","2","11 January 2007"," Settling the ""Accent"" Issue Once and For All
","Yes, DiCaprio's acting is fine--he's a good actor, not great, but good enough to carry a movie provided he isn't miscast. However, some actors are particularly adept at doing accents, but DiCaprio isn't one of them. Yes, he tries hard and obviously put a lot of work into it, but for those of us who are sensitive to regional accents in films, it wasn't good enough to pass without criticism. And this leads me to my main point: People who aren't accent savvy really shouldn't waste our time posting their opinions about how good a job an actor does with an accent. If accents don't matter to you, then say so. Accents do matter to me, and when an actor attempts a tough accent but falls even a little short, I find it distracting to the point where it makes it difficult for me to completely lose myself in the film. As an actor, it is DiCaprio's job to create a convincing character, and sometimes an accent is part of that job. This film was a pet project of DiCaprio's, so he set himself up for the task of nailing a subtle and notoriously difficult accent. Why are so many people eager to excuse him for falling short? There are several postings in which some obviously die-hard DiCaprio fans say silly things like, ""I am not familiar with the South African accent, but I have a hunch that he got it right."" I mean, come off it, people! I think Leonardo DiCaprio can manage to weather a little criticism without your starry-eyed attempts to defend him. We're not talking about a mentally or physically challenged child competing in the Special Olympics here--this is a universally-adored and well-compensated adult actor playing a part in a movie. Get over your adulation and judge his phony accent on its merits. Better yet, if you are not someone who cares about or is sensitive to accents, then keep your hopelessly biased opinion to yourself. By glossing over DiCaprio's shortcomings in the accent department, you take away from the achievements of those actors who really are able to perfect an accent that is foreign to them, such as Christian Bale in ""Batman Begins"" or Meryl Streep in ""Cry in the Dark."" DiCaprio should stick to doing an American accent, at which he excels. Case closed."

","Last year saw the arrival of a fantastic film about the western worlds exploitation of Africa within the medical industry, ""The Constant Gardener"". Some years before that ""Hotel Rwanda"" left an unforgettable impression in its depiction of the genocide in Rwanda, an atrocity as horrible as the holocaust, and raised the question of how the United Nations and the rest of the world could turn a blind eye to such a mass-slaughter.<br/><br/>This year ""Blood Diamond"" raises issues of the western worlds exploitation of Africa by focusing on Sierra Leone and its diamond fields. The film also manages to show the sociological effects of such an exploitation, whether it is in the form of civil war, child- soldiers or prostitution. At the same time, it has a very engaging and thrilling storyline.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou plays a farmer who is captured by rebels in Sierra Leone to work in the diamond fields. There he finds a big diamond and manages to hide it, just before he is taken to prison. In prison he meets Leonardo DiCaprio's smuggler, and together they embark on a journey to retrieve the diamond, but both have a different, and at times contra productive agenda. Jennifer Connelly plays a reporter who teams up with them in order to get a story.<br/><br/>Sounds like Indiana Jones/The Jewel of the Nile? Nothing could be further from the truth! This is a political thriller that manages to raise important issues without ever becoming melodramatical or ""Hollywood-ish"".<br/><br/>DiCaprio proves once and for all that he is by far the person most worthy to be labeled ""The New Brando"", this is his best performance to date! Hounsou is a character actor of the highest caliber, never hitting a false note in his performance of a man torn apart, trying to maintain some control. And Jennifer Connelly finally does something to deserve that free Oscar she received for ""A Beautiful Mind"". She is absolutely amazing, and so are the rest of the cast, down to the extras! The photo is probably the best in the history of film in this sort of genre, beating its predecessors ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"".<br/><br/>This film will probably not win any of the major Oscars, ""The Departed"" seems to be going in that direction. But pneumatically, this is by far the superior one of them two, and the best film of the year. I even dare to say this is the best American film of the millennium so far! Extra: Even though this film has scenes as powerful as anything in film history, my favorite has to be the very subtle sequence with the child soldiers playing cards, and there's a TV in the background showing a ""Bling-Bling"" rap video. I just love the paradox of these so called rappers who always brag about being proud Africans, when at the same time they measure their success in the diamonds that is the cause of the slaughtering of millions of the same people they claim to be part of. How brilliant!"

","A rare and sizable diamond is found by a worker in a warlord's diamond mine. This adds even more turbulence to an already volatile situation as different forces attempt to seize the 'blood diamond.'<br/><br/>In a certain sense I found this film to comparable to 'Babel' - it tells s story that reveals an uncomfortable truth about our world, but remains grounded and personal with its perspective. Focusing of a few principle characters - with each actor/actress giving a solid performance - the film gives a really up-close look at a world fueled by greed and filled with violence. There is something rotten in the states of Africa and the 'blood diamond' of the title is practically a classic McGuffin - totally incidental to what is going on. But if people can get so worked up over just one diamond it gives you an idea about why the situation there is what it is - and just how expensive diamonds really are.<br/><br/>Also, Leonrado DiCaprio is actually a pretty damn good actor. This year has been exceptional for him with two powerhouse roles - the other being ""The Departed"" - and his career is now something quite respectable.

"tassiedevil","7","0","1","8 January 2007"," I think Blood Diamond is a special movie.
","I watched the Blood Diamond movie last weekend. Ever since I saw the trailer of the movie, I was curious, how they could perform a film about blood diamond in African Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>Especially during the last years my basic criterion for evaluation of a movie is how much Hollywood style the movie is. In fact this one can also be categorised as a Hollywood movie. With the proudly mastered fighting scenes, where crazy rebels and high tech soldiers shooting bullets showers like a heavy rain, and moreover our heroes running around and surviving this inferno without even a scratch, the Blood Diamond movie is surely not poor with such action.<br/><br/>Another detail in the movie, which makes me annoyed was that the ordinary African people speaking in English in their own distinct accents. The only thought came to my mind at that moment was, ""Oh the movie is again prepared especially for the English speaking audiences, but I want to watch and listen to them in their own language"" Anyway, now I know, after reading in the Wikipedia, Sierra Leone was founded in 18th century by the freed slaves under the effective shadow of Britain, and only gained their independence in 1961. Which means it is understandable that they still try to speak in English even sometimes among themselves.<br/><br/>I think the director Mr. Zmick is successful in putting the movie smoothly in these poor countries streets and people. But I couldn't catch any distinct signature of him throughout the movie. I can save a few words for Mr. Di Caprio. During the last couple of years as he is getting maturer in his age and losing his baby face with the weights put on, we started to realise how a good actor he actually is. He already deserved my admiration, since breaking my heart as being obsessive-compulsive Howard Hughes in The Aviator. And in this movie only his almost genuine South African English accent proves us how much he's focused to be Danny Archer. Instead of writing too much about the African co-star Mr. Hounsou, I just would like to remind his acting in Amistad in 1997, (here ignoring his other movies in between). For me recalling him as a young, proud and leader spirited slave was a sudden flashback. Considering that he had a difficult child-young hood, I don't think he had to act too much.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, despite some of the cliché scenes, Blood Diamond is a special movie. It sheds a light on how diamond brings everything but money and wealth to this tiny poor country. Screenplay is trying to be honest and sincere, and besides the simple core story tries to cover too many facts about the illicit diamond trade. The rebel group (RUF) which was somehow created by any malicious intentions, fights against the government and people and makes massacre a reality of life in Sierra Leone. With their famous way of punishment especially to the young ones, to amputate one of the arms or legs, and using others in the so called diamond mines, to finance their rebel organization. And those stones, smuggled through the borders, exchanged in the hands and laundered by the brokers in Antwerp-Belgium and Israel, finally find their way to European customers in their most conflict-free and brilliant forms. And nobody is innocent in this story, neither the governments, nor the terrorised groups, nor the white African soldiers equipped with the very hi-tech combat gears whose so called mission is to clear the continent from socialist rebels, nor the smugglers and brokers, and lastly nor the young modern-life girls who are wishing for a diamond wedding ring without considering all the happenings till it's polished resplendently. Personally speaking there is an influence on me by this movie, and at this moment I am happy I don't have any diamond jewels, and do not plan to buy any."

","Blood Diamond is a film that depicts a certain period in a graphic and narrow scope. Although it's subject matter raises countless idealogical and moral questions, the film's predominate intention is to inform the viewer with a pragmatic perspective. Certain images in this film will resonate with you for days, the subtle and intriguing land scape of Africa is often meshed with the inhumane images that lie with in it, stating that humans are the true tyrants of nature. Unlike many films of this genre Blood Diamond reflects on contemporary racial turmoil with malicious intent, in addition to this the film generates an accusation towards prior and current atrocities such as apartheid and the foreign exchange trade. The performances are electrifying from DiCaprio's morally complacent diamond smuggler to Djimon Hounsou's petrified and conscience stricken fisherman. Edward Zwick once again directs the film on an epic scale with a candid eye. Blood Diamond isn't necessarily a film you will enjoy, astonishingly it's completely in contrast to that it's a film that invokes you to sympathize and accept leaving you impinged and invigorated."

","*spoiler* yes I warned you... I will warn you once again... And once again.... So here's my question. Would he still have saved the lives of Solomon and his son had he not gotten shot at the end? Two ways of looking at Mr. Archer: 1. He delineated himself as someone who is only looking out for himself throughout the entire movie, and the only reason he cared for Solomon is so that he can get the diamond. After he gets shot, he knows he's not going to make it, so he gives the diamond to Solomon, and realizes his errors and repents his sins. If he hadn't had gotten shot, he would still 'Lose both of them' and fly away home free towards the sunset with his diamond. 2. He was brought up to survive in a 'dog eat dog' world after his family is brutally murdered when he was 9, but his heart is at the right place.

He's definitely no moral crusader, but he's not a bad man either.

The fact is, at the end of the movie you don't know what to think of Archer.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's acting was spot on. Hounsou's effort stood out as well. On the other hand, Connelly was a fraud.

Incidentally the only decent pink diamonds come from a mine in Australia,so not much slavery there. Oh yeah talking about slavery!! The next time a black person goes on about 400 years and guilt of white people,maybe you could tell them to have a look at this and say what about now. I know they are still gonna turn it around and blame whites again,but there's no way out of that argument,unless they are in total denial. The journalist character gets silly as the movie goes on and all of a suddon she's talking photos??(black and white...Ohhh how very dramatic!!) Still there is plenty of action although seeing as Decaprio is supposed to be a super soldier it looks a bit camp as he seems to flinch when the bullets are flying. Just another thing. I brought back a rough diamond from Ghana(still got it somewhere) years ago?? and they are not that valuable,and it's quite expensive to have them cut and then you have to find someone to actually buy the thing. The movies a bit like fox hunting It good to hate rich people and also good to feel sorry for poor Africans."
"DICK STEEL","8","0","1","1 January 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Blood Diamond
","Blood Diamond marks the first 2007 movie for me, and what a blast it was, surprisingly. Directed by Edward Zwick, you'll probably enjoy the movie if you liked his previous movies - The Siege, Courage Under Fire, and The Last Samurai.<br/><br/>This movie touches on the bling-bling industry, one which feeds the demand for girls' best friend. It demonstrates the seedier side of the industry, makes allegations about the dubious operations of associated conglomerates, the plight of those sold into the greed, the victims of those who have, basically everything negative of the industry, right up to the artificial control of the diamond's exorbitant price due to a control and restriction of supply. No wonder the big boys earn money, and the little pawns at the bottom of the chain slog their lives for it. Makes you think twice about the source of the next stone you buy.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, like it or not, has his fair share of acting accolades, and what he did for Blood Diamond is no exception, garnering him a nomination for this year's Golden Globe, against himself in The Departed as well. Here, he stars as an Indiana Jone-ish character who belongs to the other end of the archaeological spectrum, that of an illegal smuggler. It's an interesting character, as his morals as greasy as those money greased palms, he speaks with an African twang, and his allegiance switches to whosoever provides him the greatest possible advantage. As Zimbawean Danny Archer, he's tough, sly, no nonsense and full of smarts. A roguish Indy Jones if you deck him out with a fedora, and definitely one of the more memorable characters DiCaprio played, given the character's shady past and present.<br/><br/>In contention here is a rare and huge pink diamond (which naturally spelt trouble), found by fisherman Solomon Vandy (played by Djimon Hounsou), one of the last survivors of his Sierra Leone tribe which was wiped out by militants. Fate brought Archer and Vandy together, and they must reluctantly journey to retrieve it - for the former, as his ticket out of a botched job and to get out of the continent, and for the latter, a means to seek out his family. Added to the fray is reporter Maddy Bowen (the beautiful Jennifer Connelly), who is in Africa to seek out the big story on the dark side of diamond prospecting.<br/><br/>The movie will definitely bring about an awareness to the diamond issue, those stones which were obtained through illegal or exploitative means. Similar to Hotel Rwanda which highlighted the plight of those subjected to ethnic cleansing, in Blood Diamonds, the UN again are given the flak with its portrayal of unhelpful officers, as millions of refugees suffer under civil war conditions - that of militants running villages to the ground and the massacre of thousands in cold blood. The government troops too are also shown as inept and ineffective, often partaking in atrocities themselves. In effect, the movie becomes a summary in its explanation of the corruption so permeated in life in TIA (This Is Africa).<br/><br/>But no worries, the talky bits are excellently blended together with the set action pieces, and together with the wonderful score by James Newton Howard, provided a very balanced narrative, taking turns to explain itself, or to dive right into massive gun battles. You would probably not feel its length, and there are enough graphic violence in the movie to satisfy anyone's blood lust.<br/><br/>However, what's more harrowing instead are scenes in which the militants train the young on guerilla warfare, indoctrinating their impressionable minds with lies and empty promises. Somehow the images of kids holding AKs never go down well with me, and during these scenes, I actually cringed. Watch and you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>I think amongst the movies opening this week, Blood Diamond will be the one I'll recommend, for its excellent characterization, and its unsophisticated delivery of thought provoking plot lines over some amazing action sequences."
"vSkyfluxx","8","0","1","31 December 2006"," film review: Blood Diamond
","Just in time to rally against all those DeBeers commercials and put fire on the Save Darfur flame  Darfur or whatever African nation is falling apart at the moment  this winter brings us Blood Diamond. This movie is about conflict diamonds  precious jewels whose sale and illegal trafficking funds war in Africa and comes at the cost of many human lives. With plenty of action, a tad of moral and social philosophy, and not surprisingly political commentary, this film is what you might expect from Hollywood when it's trying to show how honest it can be and what ""real"" issues it can portray. In other words, Blood Diamond is this year's Syriana. But fanaticism, humanitarianism, and hype aside, this is still a very good movie.<br/><br/>It portrays the chaos in Africa much like The Constant Gardener, mixed in with better and more gripping action, and the drama of City of God. Now unlike The Constant Gardener's slow, mysterious pace and conflicted heroes of Justin and Tessa Quayle that take too long to develop, Blood Diamond masterfully interweaves the tales of a father trying to find his family, a diamond smuggler, and a journalist into a fast-paced story. It captures the heart of City of God and the sadness of innocent children's eyes but in a much more streamlined way. Things are not spelled out for the viewer; attraction, danger, and death are realistic and unsaid instead of woven into clichéd dialogue. And finally, unlike Syriana, there aren't too many characters and you actually care about them as they go through the war zone of Sierra Leone in 1999.<br/><br/>Two big stars headline the show in Jennifer Connelly and Leonard DiCaprio, but both work magic in their roles. Largely unknown Djimon Hounsou, who radiates the passion and energy of a just and honest family man in dynamic times of crisis, rounds out the main characters. Connelly never fails to impress and does well with her smaller but effective role while DiCaprio takes on a much more challenging character (along the lines of The Gangs of New York's Amsterdam Vallon and The Aviator's Howard Hughes). He proves that he isn't Scorsese's second (or new) DeNiro but can still make the screen sizzle on his own. The diamond-smuggling Danny Archer isn't just a gun totting, careless opportunist. He has a past, a philosophy that goes beyond ""screw everything,"" and he is not invincible. Nothing that is revealed about his character is left to be implausible or unexplained, while still retaining depth and unpredictability. DiCaprio compliments his costars very well and masterfully jumps between the different roles Archer is forced to take on. As smoothly as a flick of a light switch, he goes from saving a child to ruthlessly fighting the child's father.<br/><br/>This film does lapse into a bit of predictable cinematography with scenes of the sunset and convoys of cars that feel lifted from elsewhere but is otherwise more raw and original than one might expect. Everything from DiCaprio's accent (South African, not British) to the minimal portrayal of the diamond industry itself indicates that this is not a run-of-the-mill political thriller that tells you what to think or how wrong something is. Like a good book, or any good story for that matter, it shows rather than tells, it feels rather than kisses and sleeps around, and it breathes and bleeds rather than do fancy cut scenes for suspense. In the end, the viewer is more open to making up his or her mind as to what he would do in these circumstances and times. The movie needs no tagline but can be summarized by one motif and acronym: TIA. ""This Is Africa"""

","I suggest that the most important feature of this film is that it can help in the decades-long process of peeling the layers of baloney that the west has used to cover its catastrophic history of imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism. Europe has never, ever, not once, taken full responsibility for the massive cultural, political and economic wreckage it brought to the Americas, to Africa, to the middle east, and to southern and south-east Asia. The US, moreover, stepped up to take Europe's place beginning in the late 19th century and has proved to be indeed a child of Europe's obsession with dominance over other peoples and cultures. While the film is still too much about white and European people, at least it points in the direction where most of the world's miseries stem: ongoing western imperialism. -- The struggle continues."

","Blood Diamond is a masterfully done film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou give breathtaking performances. It will be very difficult to choose which one of the two lead actors should win the Best Actor award. It has to be one of them. Jennifer Connelly demonstrates another Oscar-worthy supporting actress performance.Cinematography and direction are as solid as any film in recent memory. <br/><br/>The subject matter is profound and,unfortunately, timeless. Blood Diamond clearly exposes the nature of man ... neighbor killing neighbor and brother killing brother. The atrocities perpetrated by men and the greed behind those atrocities are powerfully portrayed. It is especially sad to see the theft of youth from countless young victims. The brainwashing techniques used to turn son against father is at this film's core. It's not about finding one large diamond, it's about finding lost humanity. Director Edward Zwick has made more than a movie. He has created a commentary on our current world. I can't imagine anyone not putting this film in their list of top five films this year."

","I went into Blood Diamond thinking that I was going to view a ""semi"" conscious film, slightly entertaining, and cool, staring a handsome Leonardo DiCaprio and a buffed, Djimon Hounsou, about the racist, Machiavellian, evil enterprise of the diamond trade. What I got instead was a film that surpassed all my very low expectations, layered with truly shocking revelations, functioning on many levels, with an intense, int resting plot, and an education on how independence from oppression, is no cure for peace, when diamonds are at stake! This movie submerged you in hell for 220 min and did not stop until the final credits rolled. I seriously suffered from post traumatic stress disorder from watching all the carnage and mayhem in this shocking film. The majority of the budget in this film must of gone into hiring African extras; the numerous Africans reminded me of some of the Political rally scenes in the Last King of Scotland. Where do they find so many people? Unfortunately the re-watchability of Blood Diamonds is very low due to its rushed, narrow and choppy visual feel; I would only watch this film once and would not recommend it to friends."

","Immaculate craftsmanship, fast pacing, beautiful actors and acting, spectacular locations...that's Hollywood. Add an engaging story, character and a message, and you now have a good reason to go out to a movie instead of sitting on your duff watching pay-per-view. But Blood Diamond is one of those flicks that make it worth the effort to drive the extra mile to get a perfect screen, projector, print, sound and stadium seating.<br/><br/>Leo DiCaprio has now reached the point where, like Gable, you can't forget it's him in the role, not because he's not good but because he's so good. He does become the character, but, I mean, you can't stop saying, Wow, this guy is great. (Ignore the idiots who gripe about the accent. His accent is fine.) Oscar nomination cinched. <br/><br/>Same problem with Jennifer Connelly: she's really a fine actress, but she's so damned beautiful...that skin, the nose, the eyes...<br/><br/>Same goes for Djimon Hounsou. Great looking but, Wow, acts even better! There's this scene where Leo's character barks at him to follow, and Djimon says, ""Yeah, boss"" in a way that's impossible to describe. He submits, but the same time puts the bwana in his place.<br/><br/>And the kid who plays Djimon's son.... How about a special Oscar? <br/><br/>Couple of quibbles. I'd like to have seen less chase and more process. The blood diamond trade was described, but we only saw part of it. A bit more intrigue, a little more Syriana-like complexity, would have been nice. Also, some of the local non-English dialog wasn't sub-titled in places where I feel it should have been.<br/><br/>That said, Edward Zwick has shown us why, when it comes to movie-making, no one else in the world comes close to Hollywood."

"matthewroyds01","5","0","9","24 December 2006"," This movie is kinda crappy
","In most circumstances, Blood Diamond would just be passed off as a mediocre star vehicle. But when a movie purports to be important, and fails, it deserves whatever it gets thrown at it.<br/><br/>In Blood Diamond, a peaceful Mende fisherman (Djimon Hounsou), sees the corrupt African militia coming to his village. Though he tries to save his family, they are separated. The fisherman is forced to work in the diamond fields while his son is trained to be a militia killer and the rest of his family wait in a camp. In the fields, he finds and hides a rare, pink stone.<br/><br/>Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is looking for a way out of South Africa. When he hears of this blood diamond, he sees it as his ticket, so he makes a deal to find the fisherman's family in return for the stone. A journalist (Jennifer Connelly) tags along to try to convince Archer to pay more attention to the atrocities of the government and military than his own personal riches.<br/><br/>All sounds promising so far. Hey, Indiana Jones fought Nazis. But he also never ran from a boulder in a concentration camp. Blood Diamond shows us plenty of tragedy, but it all feels like Hollywood pathos. Kids get their arms cut off, and that's bad, but the focus is on the fisherman and his family. So it sucks that his kid is being brainwashed, and his wife and other children are locked in a camp, but all he does about it for the whole movie is scream and cry. How is that going to help them? Are the big men with guns going to feel threatened by his powerful voice, or find sympathy in his plight? It's the sign of a filmmaker that doesn't really have anything to say, so he just shows some tragedy and lets his actors cry about it. The action is nothing to get excited about either. They dodge a lot of gunfire and run around the desert and jungle, but there's never any wonder of ""how are they going to get out of this one?"" It's just ""time for an action scene, get some helicopters and machine guns.""<br/><br/>There isn't even any banter that makes you bond with the trio on their journey. Connelly is playfully flirtatious but Archer seems so uninterested there's never any romantic tension. And Archer is either using the fisherman or he's going to help him, but there's no talk outside of the political issue that makes these real characters. Nobody's playfully hating each other, or even really learning how much they actually have in common.<br/><br/>Blood Diamond is Oscar bait at its most blatant. Don't let them suck you in with their lies of rousing action or moving emotional journeys. It's just tragedy by the numbers peppered with lame battle scenes."
"bumrucker311","6","0","2","23 December 2006"," Blood Diamond, not the best it could be
","Personally, the way the people of this time and place were represented was rather one-sided, and didn't have any heart whatsoever. The heart lay in the main characters, and was well-written in that respect. It's just the people of the land, especially the children, that seemed completely and irreverently heartless. Even if these children were supposed killing machines, there's no way that they couldn't have felt some sort of guilt. Yes, this is shown in one instance, when a child kills a man blindfolded for the first time, as part of a training program for infantile foot soldiers. But, nonetheless, this aspect should have been shown in more than one instance for the good of balancing out the characters. In Shakespeare, every character, even the utilities, have some sort of 3rd dimension. But to make the children of the film completely heartless seems rather careless.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I thought that the writing served some of its purpose. It's borderline propaghanda, but remains entirely entertaining the whole way through. I only fell asleep because I was extremely comfortable and had a rather long and arduous schedule that day.<br/><br/>The acting was top notch in every respect, especially the stars of the film. Leonardo Di Caprio doesn't have so much of a stretch, seemingly, in the suit of his character. BUT!, this is not what I mean. Leo's character actually had a sarcastic depth not seen in Jack from Titanic or his character in The Departed. His strengths show brilliantly in the film, and create a glowing effect throughout the film. You can't get enough of him. Djimon Hounsou's raw performance is as outstanding as Leo's, and typically shines in all of his works, even in The Island he is entirely entrancing. Jennifer Connelly is above her standard performances, and satisfyingly delivers. The utility characters, though some are carelessly written, are still well acted, and make great use of the text they are given.<br/><br/>The cinematography was completely standard. No artistic eye shows up in this film at all. It's rather disheartening to think that Zwick didn't take advantage of the boundaries outside of an action film's cinematographic stylings. There are times throughout the film where a beautiful frame may be shown of a particular instance, and the moment is not taken advantage of. I was rather disappointed in this department.<br/><br/>And in these negative respects, I'm disappointed in Zwick as well. His direction of the images and the story being told could have been far more commanding and innovative. The story was absolutely fantastic, tight, intricate, and well furbished. The substance could have been boosted tremendously, and as the director of the film, if Zwick felt this, he could have solved the problem by either meeting with the screenwriter or sending the script to a decent script doctor, like David Mamet (not to put him secondhand to his stellar play and screen writing careers). Zwick's commitment to the project didn't reach its full potential in my opinion.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Blood Diamond delivers a fun-to-watch action flick with a fantastic cast, great performances, and a great story. Everything else can be seen in your standard horror movie or adventure picture, such as Laura Croft: Tomb Raider, or something of the like."

Blood Diamond is a film about the price of truth, freedom, and fortune, that poses you to ask where all this bling bling comes from. <br/><br/>As an actor I am amazed by this movie.

The heart ripping opening scene captured my attention forcing me to watch this epic unfold.

The one clear envelope I can see this film pushing is a brief awareness. A glimpse at a way of life I never thought existed. I can begin to understand now how diamonds play a part in war trading. I can begin to understand how the rebels would loose their humanity and to live like animals. And I can begin to understand that the connection between father and son never dies. <br/><br/>The unfortunate thing about the topic of this film is that it is not glamorous. People don't get excited to see stories about African villages being torn apart and forced to struggle for what we call nothing. Thats why it is unique that these stars have taken the time to fully develop characters that show us the truth about what we don't see everyday, and make it beautiful.

"Imtheechelon","10","0","1","15 December 2006"," A heart gripping adventure with a plot and action!
","DiCaprio has done it again with his amazing role in this movie along with Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou. This movie shows life in the diamond fields in Africa and how the towns people are put in harms way over a small stone worth a lot of money. DiCaprio has done a awesome job on the African accent. This movie shows greed, courage, hope, anger, and love. This movie is one of the best movies of the year! Excellent plot and good action! The acting is very good in the movie, all three actors did a great job portraying their character in this movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time with a good plot."
"KUAlum26","9","0","1","15 December 2006"," Socio-political drama paired with action adventure
","Solomon Vandy(Djimon Honsou,to me,the best part of this movie)is little more than a simple farmer/fisherman in rural Sierra Leone. His simple life is interrupted when R.U.F. rebels sack his village,kidnap his son and force him into forced labor. When he stumbles upon a large diamond in the mines,he goes against better sense and hides the gem,which doesn't go unnoticed by his captors. He manages to get arrested,where he makes the acquaintance of mostly amoral diamond broker Danny Archer(Leonardo DiCaprio,who does his best to be as gritty and unsavory as possible here),who decides to sidle up to the village man to find the diamond he's accused of having. The two,along with a savvy,bright reporter named Maddy Bowman(Jennifer Connelly,intelligent and sporting the most inscrutable green-eyed stare),make the long trek back to the wilds of Siera Leone,looking for Solomon's family,which in turn is tied to the diamond Solomon found.<br/><br/>Director Edward Zwick seems to like large,panoramic movie settings,and he seems to be the perfect director for this piece that utilizes as much of the wide,rough terrain of western Africa. Writer Charles Leavitt's script is rife with socio-political theming,and while it's as subtle as a sledgehammer,it's effective all the same. The acting performances move in a mostly perfect rhythm with the film's tone,particularly Honsou and DiCaprio. <br/><br/>An effective blend of action and conscience,this movie should enthrall AND make the viewer think about the full cost of the bling that sells at your jeweler's."
"Randy-Martens","9","0","1","15 December 2006"," Best Movie I've Seen All Year!
","This excellent historical/drama, so typical of Edward Zwick films, is simply OUTSTANDING - having all the elements of a great motion picture: well-written script, very real-life characters, beautiful cinematography, moving soundtrack (OK, except for the rap music, which is part of the background story), close attention to detail, etc.<br/><br/>I must say Di Caprio is really maturing as an actor, slowly becoming extremely versatile in his roles, perhaps becoming this generation's Jimmy Stewart, or more recently, Tom Hanks. Leonardo is superb playing the character of Danny Archer. I went to college with a number of South Africans back in the ""70's, and Di Caprio really has got their unique accent pinned down quite well."
"luckyshot1111","10","0","1","15 December 2006"," This is not Hollywood, Its real.
","Often Hollywood movies are expected to contain over the top additives and exaggerations, NOT this one. People if you want a dose of pure reality... watch Blood Diamond. As a African I can say there is no movie more realistic and true than this one. In fact it hurt to see it,because its so real. Yes these atrocities are still happening as we speak.(DRC, Congo, Sudan, Uganda, Chad, Somalia, Ivory Coast, Zimbabwe,Liberia, CAF) Learn something about these countries and what you can do to help. It is often said that the lack of education is the result of such horrible actions. Please do your part by watching this film."

","Ten points to anyone who gets that reference. I actually thought of that quote in the middle of this movie which I can assure you is not a good sign. I don't know maybe I'm over it. Maybe I'm sick of being informed about problems that are supposed to shock me, because I've gone past shock to ""whatever"". Had the same problem with Babel. Movies like this aren't really that great if you're not emotionally impacted by them and I wasn't.<br/><br/>I like Djimon Hounsou and Leonardo DiCaprio and Edward Zwick but somehow this movie fell flat for me. Now the performances of those actors were very good and Zwick is the master of battle scenes. So if that interests you that should make the movie worth your money right there. But there are huge gaps of nothingness in the form of Jennifer Connelly's performance. Homegirl cannot flirt. She's extremely beautiful and very talented but I found out that she is not charming. And this character was obviously meant to be. And what's worse is that she seems to have come down with a severe case of Ally Sheedy Jaw. Now the character was sort of equivalent to Joaquin Phoenix's character in Hotel Rwanda but that character had the sense to leave when he lost his usefulness and did not hog up screen time the way her silly reporter/love interest broad did. Waste of space. I mean she was integral in terms of being part of their plan but the added on BS of the romance angle just stretched it way too thin. I feel bad for saying this but I really feel like this movie would have been greatly improved had her role been cut down or if another actress had played the part.<br/><br/>There are a few instances in the film that make you go ""didn't I just see someone do that in another movie?"" especially toward the very end when Leo and Djimon become Sam and Frodo climbing Mt. Doom. I know this is a very cynical comment but that's how I felt coming out of this movie. Parts of it are very well made and most of the performances are good but it's got lots of slow points where you drift and you have to force yourself to pay attention especially when Connelly is on screen. So the good scenes get 9s the bad scenes get 5s and you wind up with a 7/10."
"TLDavis1230","9","0","1","14 December 2006"," My Review Of Blood Diamond
","I just came back from seeing Blood Diamond, and I have to tell you that I was quite pleased. I had no idea what the critic of the Miami Herald was speaking about (Mr. Rene Rodriguez), talking about this movie does not shine. This movie came all the way through in a multitude of colors, and in spite of what you may feel about Leonardo DiCaprio, this film is definitely worth seeing. It is very true to historic form, that diamonds in the past were used to finance revolutions and coup de tats.<br/><br/>After seeing this film, people in America do not realize how lucky/good they have it when they take a look around. Imagine being asleep in your bed just like any other night, and revolutionary forces barging into your home and taking your family and yourself by force. A lot of African nations to this day, still do not have central government or social services. An example of this is back in 1993 when Mohammed Farah Adid was the ruler of Somalia, he seized shipments of food from the country's borders and caused his own people to starve to death. My point is that this film is not only about greed, but man's inhumanity to man and all of its atrocities.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone who wants a true and deep-hearted look at war, how it is financed, and the consequences thereof. Granted that this is not a war film per se, just like the movie 'The Deer Hunter' was really about friendship."
"kate-carstens","10","0","1","13 December 2006"," Excellent
","This is one of the most astounding movies I have ever seen. The acting is brilliant -although being South African - I must say that Leonardo DiCaprio's attempt at a South African accent is rather poor. Jennifer Connelly did an outstanding job in her role as a journalist, and Djimon Hounsou had an enormous presence and captivated the audience in his role as a Mende fisherman. This is a brilliant, heart-rendering movie. One of the best, if not THE best, of 2006. I don't recommend taking children to see it... the violence and graphic nature is sickening. But we are given insight into what the idea of power,control & money can do to people. Edward Zwick did an amazing job ofdirecting this movie, and was able to capture the harsh, untamed beauty of Africa. I believe the viewer would have to be from Africa to truly understand the poignancy of the movie.I sincerely hope this movie receives the recognition and acclaim it deserves."
"george.schmidt","5","0","6","12 December 2006"," Noble effort with mixed results
","BLOOD DIAMOND (2006) ** Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou, Jennifer Connelly, Kagiso Kuypers, Arnold Vosloo, Antony Coleman, Bneu Mabhena, Anointing Lukola, David Harewood, Basil Wallace, Jimi Mistry, Michael Sheen, Stephen Collins. Based on the South African accounts of harvesting diamonds that have been known to finance wars (hence the title), a former soldier of fortune (DiCaprio) reluctantly agrees to help a fellow countryman (Hounsou) find his family after being torn asunder and forced to dig for diamonds by marauding groups of brute force, when a sizable jewel is uncovered proving to be their ticket for salvation. Although a noble effort is undertaken by all involved the funereal pacing and repeat of action sequence  lengthy speech by main character  action sequence etc. taxes the nerves and the fact that Hounsou is reduced to a howling, righteously angry man is getting to be a sad indictment for this otherwise excellent actor's skills. Connelly is miscast as an American journalist who has the misfortune for one of the worst scenes in the film : facing certain death she asks her would-be assassins if it is OK to take their photos (!) (Dir: Edward Zwick)"
"aharmas","6","0","3","11 December 2006"," Bloody Overkill
","It's hard to dismiss work by Di Caprio as something substandard, and Zwick has in previous occasions come up with work that transcends the physical and shows us what our spirit can achieve. There is plenty of good intentions in this film, and I'm glad it exposes something of the horrendous crimes that are seldom publicized for some of the peoples in Africa.<br/><br/>What I found disturbing in this film is the amount of violence that has somehow found its way to the final cut, and the problem with having too much in it is that it does result in a state of numbness. It's still horrible to watch as it is effectively portrayed in the film, and it hovers too closely to a caricature. ""Hotel Rwanda"" brought hell portrayed hell effectively, with enough shown to us so that we could understand the intensity of the tragedy. In here, hell is threatening to kill the heart of the film, as it becomes the central protagonist, keeping us from connecting to the human tragedy that is at the heart of the film.<br/><br/>Fortunately, we have an actor like Hinsou, who is able to show us how his soul is traumatized as he sees what goes around him, with his immediate family's situation and with the people who are dying and killing each other in front of him.<br/><br/>There are very powerful moments in this film, particularly the ones showing you the destruction of innocence, as children are brainwashed and indoctrinated into becoming monsters to serve a different type of regime. Sadly, even DiCaprio can't lift the film beyond an average level where machinery rules and the soul disappears behind the use of technology and special effects. He is much more effective showing us the turmoil in the soul of his character in ""The Departed"". In here the transformation from manipulator to benefactor rings a bit phony. It might not be his fault, but it might be the interpretation of a script that needed a little more work to expose this tragedy in a more impacting manner.<br/><br/>""Blood Diamond"" is just too much of something... horrible and violent as it could be."
"cnewf","7","0","2","10 December 2006"," Good - for Hollywood!
","This is classic Hollywood ""dual-use"" - tell a popular story to send a serious message. The idea is that you can use formula elements to get a huge audience who then learns uncomfortable things. You can tell the truth about the world and make enormous amounts of box office - no conflict there, right? The movie takes on big issues like child soldiers, diamond wars, failed states, kids with chopped-off hands, random slaughter of villagers, millions of refugees. It has excellent Hollywood production values - the action scenes dip you into terrifying violence and stir you around. The lead performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Djiman Hounsou are wonderful. DiCaprio's character, an ex-military diamond smuggler, is interesting and complex. But there are limits to dual-use strategy. The white hero has a love interest, an implausibly beautiful American journalist who tries to flirt her way into a scoop and then implausibly toughens up. In a Hollywood film individuals always have to be able to make a difference and not just save their own skin, so Solomon Vandy's search for his family is juxtaposed with the more ridiculous, self-flattering story of a journalist taking on the world-wide diamond trade. Finally, there's Hollywood's compulsory narcissism, which means that it can't explain why control of diamond fields requires rebel posses to massacre innocent villagers, or imagine African solutions to anything. There's a weird racism floating through all the sympathy for African victims, so that the rebel army scenes are shot Pirates-of-the-Caribbean style with gun-toting children dancing insanely around roaring fires in bloody compounds in an unwitting repeat of old Western stereotypes of bloodthirsty African savages. In Hollywood dual-use, structural problems are suppressed in favor of lone villains with a long reach, so that it is impossible to imagine, for example, that there may be a problem with capitalism itself, which has done so little good for so long for Africa. It all leads to a consumer boycott, the ultimate middle-class American political gesture - to not shop for one thing we want! It's true that Americans aren't interested in wearing ""conflict diamonds"" dug by one-handed African slave children. It's true that Hollywood does not exist in order to refute naive business books like ""The World Is Flat."" But putting a little more African thought and society in place of American journalists might have made the movie's hope for the future at least half as convincing as its blood-soaked action."
"evanevans333","7","0","2","10 December 2006"," Bad Editing; Music Score 180 Degrees Wrong; Acting is Superb!
","The editing doesn't let you dwell or savor anything. The editing is singly responsible for destroying any cinematic quality the film could have, whether it's grace, elegance, or narrative. The editing never allows a single thought on the cinematic narrative speak. It's the largest cause of the film's weakness.<br/><br/>The music score by James Newton Howard is way off. During scenes where our main characters are trying to escape rebel forces in order to either save his family or find salvation, the music chooses instead to be testosterone driven and percussive, completely missing the reason d'etre, and making it a vanilla action scene all about rebel invasion. Even if it was the Director who made this poor decision, it was Mr. Howard's responsibility to illuminate to Mr. Zwick the poor direction that choice is. That the right choice was not made, either says Howard is ignorant to such score-film dynamics, or is too passive or weak of a creative team member to actually heighten any film he works on beyond just the power of the Director's own boundaries.<br/><br/>The story is in itself undeniably important. It doesn't fail on this level at all. Except perhaps by being unbiased and insensitive.<br/><br/>Last and most important, DiCaprio's performance would be easy for Academy Members to feel proud awarding a nomination at this year's Oscar's contest. That isn't to say he'd win, since the film he's in is whirling around him at sub par levels to his performance, but his job is stellar, 100% top notch, and it's an easy non fiction vital subject matter that is politically correct to support.<br/><br/>See it. Rent it. Enjoy it. It's above average. C+ to B area, with my own weighting at about a B-.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 anyway."
