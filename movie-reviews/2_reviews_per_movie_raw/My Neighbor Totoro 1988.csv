"jmjolnir","9","388","417","25 November 2003"," A kids movie?
","Picture if you will, a 27 year old male, scanning through his dvd collection, trying to figure out what to watch, on a boring night at home. Suddenly, he stops at My Neighbor Totoro and smiles.  Well, that's a pretty typical happenning around the house here.<br/><br/>Miyazaki created a true masterpiece with this film.  It has everything a person, of any age, could want.  There are points that it is hilarious, a few points where it makes one slightly nervous, the animation is outstanding (as with all Miyazaki films), and aside from lacking a little bit in plot (what movie doesn't nowadays?), the story is wonderful.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes this film shine, at least for me, is that there is absolutely no antagonist role.  No bad guy whatsoever, and only a genius like Miyazaki could pull that off.<br/><br/>Is this a childrens movie?  Yes, of course it is.  Is it a movie only for children?  Well...  maybe for the inner child inside all of us.  There's humour in this movie that the young will laugh at, and there's a bit of humour in the movie that only adults will fully catch and appreciate, without it being ""adult humour"".<br/><br/>I would reccommend, and have reccommended this film to anyone that would listen.<br/><br/>Thank you again Miyazaki Sensei."
"ghostofdaniel","10","258","281","18 August 2004"," The cutest movie I ever saw !
","My favorite Miyazaki's movie is ""Princess Mononoke"" on a graphical scale. But on a ""charming scale"", this one is really the best.<br/><br/>Even the Disney movies are not so charming than this movie. Poetic, charming, cute, I can't find the words to describe the good this movie made to me. Miyazaki brings us into the wonderlands of the children, better than ""Alice in wonderland"" or ""Peter pan"".<br/><br/>In fact, Miyazaki makes us loving children. In the movie, the children run, shout all time, laugh, cry, and so on. In the real world, I hate this. In normal movies I hate this too. But, here, every actions of the two little girls touch us deep in our heart. We learn to love children's world.<br/><br/>Every one of us will have a smile on this face, from the beginning to the end of this movie.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is the first encounter between Mei and Totoro. It's fun, poetic, and charming. Miyazaki succeeds to make a movie enjoyable for the very little kids (4 y.o.) and for the adult audience. It's very rare to succeed doing that !<br/><br/>Really, a masterpiece !<br/><br/>10/10 !"
"billf7","10","153","165","13 February 2005"," The kind of film that stays with you afterwards...
","I first watched this film in Japanese with a 12 year old translating for me and I still thought it was incredible. There are so many wonderful touches, like a tin can in the stream while the kids are fascinated by a fish, or the flying scenes (I'm convinced that Ang Lee thought of Miyazaki when he made The Hulk, just in terms of the jumping scenes) that show a curious mind at work throughout the picture. I also love the sense of magic and innocence (and the lack of violence) which pervades the movie. It is a real antidote from the Disney formula which always involves a villain being trashed at the end. This is a film about the wonder of being a child and experiencing something incredible which adults can't see but recognize nonetheless. It works for any age as well. Enjoy."
"Spectravideo","10","319","357","1 January 2005"," This is a great film!
","There is no compulsory villain in this wonderfully animated film, no moral lessons, no standard blue print story, and the characters will definitely not break out in a song. Thank God! It's simply a great film for all ages. Don't mind if the soundtrack isn't dubbed to your native language, my kids (4 and 6 years old) could easily follow the story with just a few helpers. Japanese is a wonderful language. The film has great direction, beautiful backgrounds and a mystical, pleasant aura throughout. There's nothing like this, I promise you. It's idyllic, for the most part, but still with an exciting story that unfolds into something very unexpected."
"EarthwormJimFan","10","158","177","20 February 2005"," A delightful, touching, timeless classic!
","From the brilliant ""Walt Disney of Japan"", Hayao Miyazaki, comes a wonderful soothing film that everyone will simply embrace. Featuring stunning animation, endearing personable characters, and a heart-tugging storyline that's simple, enchanting, and even dramatic.<br/><br/>Sometimes you feel like you're not watching an animated children's movie, because the characters (particularly the children) and the storyline seem so realistic. There's no bad guy, no song numbers, and no references to pop-culture. Most cartoons (especially Disney) feature these and it gets old and routine. Here we have a break from all of that and get a real masterpiece.<br/><br/>Miraculously, Totoro doesn't talk, and yet you can still understand what the lovable furry creature is thinking with his endearing actions. And the six-legged CatBus is undeniably one of the most imaginative characters in animation history. And the human characters are also remarkable. Mei and Satsuki act like little girls, not like kids who are smarter than adults (a routine toons today are guilty of).<br/><br/>I loved Totoro when I was a small child and I always will. When I have children of my own someday, I will show them Totoro instead of toy commercials like Dora and Elmo's world.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: A masterpiece... pure and simple."
"marka_dogg","10","74","82","15 September 2005"," Wonderfully Magical!
","Like all Miyazaki films, this one is absolutely sacred. Some parts are reminiscent of Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Spirited Away (and Alice in Wonderland by extension), but Totoro stands out as probably the most unique of them all.<br/><br/>The premise is nice and simple, which works brilliantly because the plot is established as a foundation without hindering the experience of the movie itself. The viewer is allowed unrestricted access and exploration of the messages offered by the film.<br/><br/>In addition, Totoro is not bound by any rules of traditional storytelling. Instead, it presents occurrences that touch on a fundamental human level that is so deep and profound that it will have you feeling a range of emotions. There are so many layers to this movie, each one meaningful and special. From community building to the love of a family to sibling relationships to facing the unknown; everyone can take away something personal from this movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most sacred aspect of the film, however, is that it reminds us that life is magical. Not all of us have a neighbor like Totoro, but we are all fortunate in different ways. Each of us has something to treasure, something that brings joy and comfort.<br/><br/>Totoro is special in that it frees the viewer to be a child again and to contemplate the world through a perspective that we have perhaps forgotten. Everything is new and interesting and beautiful, from a crumbling porch to an acorn seed. We live in a magical world, and it is definitely worth taking the time to appreciate this."
"burgan6203","10","137","160","29 September 2004"," This is the movie I watch to restore my faith in humanity
","I first saw ""My Neighbor Totoro"" when I was maybe seven.At the time, I thought that it was really boring(that was still when I liked Disney movies). Years later, when I discovered ""Princess Mononoke"" I learned that MNT was by the same director and watched it again. And I find that I appreciate this film a whole lot more now then I did when I was seven.<br/><br/>The animation is absolutely stunning(as with all Miyazaki films)and the story is deceptively simple, told with patient, subtle attention to detail. The best example IMO is the scene where Mei falls asleep on Totoro's stomach.It's fruitless to try and describe it;you have to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>In closing, I would just like to say that I can't wait for a decent DVD to arrive so I can view this quiet masterpiece in widescreen in Japanese with subtitles."
"ww_sketcher","9","74","87","5 April 2005"," Totoro is a Winner
","Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro is a film that should be able to put a smile on any viewers face, and without a doubt, it'll take you on one of the most whimsical and fantastic journey's ever.<br/><br/>My Neighbor Totoro is a story that definitely something children can relate with, as i watched this with someone, they immediately paused the film and asked if this reminded me of being 4 years old again. This film really connects with people. But it's far from a quality nostalgia piece, it's well animated, beautiful, avoids cliché stereotypes (from both typical of the Anime genre and Children's Fantasy films), and is beautifully filmed (see scenes such as the girls waiting for the bus with Totoro and the scene where the magic nuts and seeds grow with the help of Totoro).<br/><br/>Even the English dub done by Fox isn't as bad everyone states. I've seen the Japanese version, and i'd have to say it's a mixed-bag between having Mei's voice sounds a bit too bratty for the English version, or having the Father's voice sound a bit awkward and perhaps not as caring in the Japanese version. Disney is said to be releasing a re-dub in mid-to-late 2005, so perhaps that will even out the controversy.<br/><br/>This film may not reach the heights of other Anime classics (mainly it's double bill with Grave of the Fireflies, or Miyazaki's other masterpieces Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away), however this will definitely be high on any film lovers list, and is definitely a high water mark of it's genre.<br/><br/>A solid 9/10, This film is next to impossible to watch without it pushing a smile out of your face."
"LaserBears","10","29","33","17 August 2007"," Rare Classic
","I watched this movie when I was a kid, and while it never caught my attention as I do other commercial movies, I think it had a quiet and subtle effect on me over the years. Sometimes I think about that film, but I never knew why. So, after watching it again as an adult I realized why this movie stay within me: Totoro is a rare film that manages to capture the essence of a child's emotions and vision without being filtered through the adult's tendency to editorialize it, to insert a moral judgment, or to sugar coat it. Mei's behavior is naked, showing raw happiness as well as anger. Her movements are strong and her voice fierce, she thinks she lives in a world without limitations and not binded by adult's notion of etiquette. Satsuki is at a crossroads between adulthood and what remains of her innocence, we see her anxieties and we identify the world of the movie through her eyes. Totoro's physical characteristic is actually menacing and otherworldly, and our first impression of him (through the girls' eyes) is a natural mix of fear and amazement... the same reaction any human would have when confronting something foreign. But then something magical happens: Totoro moves and behaves just like Mei. We identify with this raw, pure energy of joy and imagination. That Studio Ghibli managed to express this idea visually, through character design, storytelling, and animation, is a rare and special accomplishment. This effect cannot be described during a script meeting with a committee of marketing execs.<br/><br/>A typical American studio would be worried about presenting its main character as frightening, would redesign Totoro as a ""cuter"" character as a safe strategy, and would certainly make the father more of a one-dimensional, stereotypical ""adult"" character for dramatic purposes.<br/><br/>But in this movie, we see the background story of the characters by deceptively simple closeup shot of the pebbles in the stream, or the details of the bathtub.<br/><br/>But the most telling moment of the movie is actually early on: when the girls tried to push down the rotting wooden support of the house. At first only playing around, they then gave a serious effort to try to bring it down. But it doesn't fall. Seeing that the support stays, they simply move on. That establishes the tone and the world they inhabit: Life is unpredictable. Adults must learn to expect the worst to happen in order to deal daily with the real world. But the child has not yet fully learned this skill, so through their eyes, we see what we were, and what was important to us, long buried but not forgotten.<br/><br/>Kids should see this movie as an alternative to the shallow mainstream entertainment. Whether they like it or not is irrelevant; its lasting impact is worth more that the toy of the month. Adults should see this movie to re-look at themselves and what they were, who they are now, and what they want to become. It doesn't preach anything, it's a simple story that you will enjoy when you can stop and have time for yourself and for the people you care about."
"Galina_movie_fan","10","17","19","15 October 2007"," Another miracle from Hayao Miyazaki
","I absolutely agree with Roger Ebert who called ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""One of the most beloved of all family films"". Its colorfully bright and sparkling animation is enchanting. It is incredibly realistic and at the same time makes us along with two main characters, the young sisters ready for a miracle to happen any minute. The gentle story is touching, uplifting, funny, and tender without being overly sentimental or didactic. The film takes place in the early 50s, when 10-year-old Satsuki and her baby sister, curious and energetic 4-year-old Mei spend one summer in an old house in the country side with their University professor father while their mother recovers from a serious illness in the nearby hospital. The great master Hayao Miyazaki remembers well what it is like to be a child, to see magic in the everyday life and be always ready to encounter it. This ability usually disappears as the child becomes adult but it stays forever in a few chosen, and they become the visionary Artists - just like Miyazaki himself. The film is partially autobiographical for the writer/director/storyboard artist. ""When Miyazaki and his brothers were children, his mother suffered from spinal tuberculosis for nine years, and spent much of her time hospitalized. It is implied, yet never revealed in the film, that Satsuki and Mei's mother also suffers from tuberculosis. He once said the film would have been too painful for him to make if the two protagonists were boys instead of girls."" (From the IMDb film trivia)<br/><br/>Totoro of the title is an adorable funny blue forest spirit who lives in the nest beneath a huge tree and makes the trees grow and the winds blow. Totoro becomes the friend and protector of the sisters and one day he sends them on the bus journey that is like nothing they and the viewers could ever imagine. I wish I could ride that cat bus. What a wild and kind imagination an artist should have to create it. How much happier we all are knowing that Hayao Miyazaki exists and makes his amazing films at the Studio Ghibli for which King Totoro is the mascot."
"Jeremy Bristol","9","81","110","31 May 2001"," A superb, uncynical journey into the imagination. Not so great dubbing, though.
","This movie, set in Japan in the early fifties, is director Miyazaki's tribute to his mother (who suffered from tuberculosis, just like Satsuki and Mei's mother), his childhood home, and childhood innocence.  Although some people who watch this movie wonder where the Americans are (this is post-WWII Japan, after all) and why so little screen time is spent on the girls' mother, but that may be partly due to the dubbing.<br/><br/>Americans: First of all, the house the girls move into is rather European in design (with doorknobs, and an attic, and a front porch) despite the Japanese style bath and occasional sliding door.  Secondly, Mei and Satsuki are really into Western fairy tales (the are brief glimpses of Japanese translations of The Three Billy Goats Gruff and other stories, along with Mei inadvertently re-enacting scenes from Alice in Wonderland and Chronicles of Narnia).  On top of that, according to Helen McCarthy and other Miyazaki experts, the name ""Totoro"" is little Mei's mispronunciation of the Japanese transliteration of the English word ""troll"" (""tororo,"" which the Japanese would pronounce like ""tololo"" because they do not distinguish between r's and l's).  This is why an accurate dubbed version is nearly impossible (like any little girl, Mei mispronounces a lot of words).<br/><br/>The Mother: I think this movie is entirely about the mother.  Throughout, you see them subtly (almost too subtly at times) change from completely carefree to terrified with each scene involving the mother.  This parallels Satsuki's coming of age subplot (she's ten and like anyone that age she is self-conscious about believing in Santa, or in this case Totoro).  There's a little bit of both in the culturally-shocking--though completely innocent--bath scene (both girls take a bath with their father during a wind storm).<br/><br/>Really, though, My Neighbor Totoro is less about story than it is about the imagination of children.<br/><br/>Although the animation is a little dated and a bit jerky at times, the direction is absolutely top notch.  There is enough visual creativity to rival an average Hitchcock film (Miyazaki's a huge fan of Hitch: check out the long wait at the bus stop, which is reminiscent of North by Northwest). Highlights include a Mary Poppins-esque ride on an Oriental top, a beautifully animated storm, Mei's nap on the slowly rising and falling chest of the giant totoro, and a cat-bus complete with headlight eyes."

","I'm a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki's work and was rather disappointed that this movie did not have the Japanese language/English subtitles option. But, I've finally seen it and must admit that it is incredibly cute. One does NOT have to be a child to enjoy this movie or any of Miyazaki's movies. The story line was good and and the characters were really touching. The totoros were so adorable that I want a plushie of one. I also loved the artwork. I finally know what some of the scenes are from in the AMVs that I've seen. I would definitely recommend this to families as well as to those who are Miyazaki fans. A definite thumbs up. Though I do wonder where Miyazaki gets some of the ideas for his characters such as that cat bus."
"zorrothefox","10","11","13","12 January 2006"," Delightful Children's movie
","What can I say ? It's a really endearing movie, and even though it's a children's movie, I found myself captivated. The story is about two children, who move to the village with their father. They come into contact with various lovable spirits/ghosts.<br/><br/>Before watching various Miyazaki movies, my view of Japanese animation was that it was mostly full of violent animated serials, with a smear of science fiction. Seen them one, seen them all. I know that most people love to watch these type of animations. But I've never really been a big fan of these. One exception being ""Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within"".<br/><br/>I watched this movie, because it was directed by Hayao Miyazaki. I had already seen ""Sen to Chihiro No Kamikakushi"" and "" Neko No Ongaeshi"" (thanks to these being rated in the top 250 on IMDb) and found it to be a wonderful movie. The same applies to this movie.<br/><br/>The animation is stunning, even though it was done in 1988. I guess that's because since the entire animation is hand drawn, it doesn't get much better than this.<br/><br/>The story is captivating, and keeps one wondering as to what will happen. I have a 2 year old niece, and when I watched the children in this movie, I was constantly thinking of how well the director has gotten into the skin of children. Their various facial expressions, cries and antics are uncanny. Many of the scenes are just magical, and I was really amazed at the creative imagination of the director and animators. Even the title song is very hummable.<br/><br/>After watching these movies, I have now realized that the best Japanese animation is not the type that is shown on ""Cartoon Network"".<br/><br/>A must-watch movie for all children, and adults too!"
"ma-cortes","8","4","4","6 February 2019"," Riveting, visually sumptuous and marvellous animated movie by the great Hayao Miyazaki
","Fascinating and wonderful cartoon movie by the genius Hayao Miyazaki . This magnificent cartoon movie concerns Japanese legends , and forest spirits . Exciting and rather good film set in the fifities about a Japanese family moves to country , being formed by the University professor father and his children : Salsaki and her younger sister Lucy whose new house in the country is filled with magic , including strange creatures as some black dusty balls and especially by Tororo . It is a cuddly , friendly animal that can fly , if weird mix of bear , owl , cat and seal with a gentle rear and whiskers . Naturally , every time the two sisters get into mischief , the sympathetic Totoro is there to rescue then . Meanwhile their mummy recuperates from Tuberculosis in hospital and only gradually becomes aware that something's hanging in the trees outside .<br/><br/>This wonderful film is plenty of fantasy , adventures, spectacular images and with ecological message . The picture is narrated with sensibility and sense of wonder and being quite entertaining . This is the animated movie that first brought Miyazaki international attention , it remains as a cartoon movie achievement almost without parallel. The first half delicately captures both quietness and mystery as two little girls move with their daddy to remote new mansion in the countryside , inhabited by strange spirits . While younger spectators will adore the funny creatures : Tororo , Kodamas , the twelve-legged cat-bus that can be only seen by kiddies ; adults will perhaps best appreciate the movie's delicate rending of atmosphere and its attuned understanding of the wonders and anxieties of infancy . It contains a great sestimentality and sensibility , it will be utterly refreshing to those raised on a diet of Walt Disney . The protagonist animal , house-sized Totoro steals the show , it is a giant cat-alike that can fly and has a magic bus which only can be seen by children . This stunning and superbly imagined film will appeal both , children and adults .<br/><br/>The motion picture was splendidly realized by Hayao Miyazaki , he personally corrected or redrew more than 80,000 of the film's thousands animation cels . Being accompanied by sensitive music score composed by his usual musician , Joe Hisaishi. It packs up a big resonance , weight and delicacy that make it all an awesome film . Never remotely didactic , the movie is ultimately a children fantasy that touches brief thoughtful issues dealing with sintoism religion , ethical , ecological and kiddies psychological themes . It has some self-biographic elements as Miyazaki's mother suffered TB for 9 years , and she standed in hospital . It followed a Short movie , titled ¨Mei and the cat-bus¨ it is only exhibited in Ghibli studios . My neighbour Tororo premiered in cinemas along with ¨The tomb of glowworms ¨ (1988) by Isao Takahata and failed at boxoffice . However , later on Tororo has turned to be a real classic movie . As Tororo is an icon or brand in Ghibli Studios , getting a great merchandising . No other Word : a masterpiece<br/><br/>
Miyazaki wasn't yet a culture hero in Japan when made this animated mythic adventure ; later on , he directed ¨Princess Monokone¨converted the first of any kind to gross over the box office in Japan and around the world , it raised him to a status approaching living national treasure . Miyazaki also directed other excellent cartoon movies as ¨Lupin¨ (1978) , Castle of Cagliostro¨ (1979) , ¨Nausica of the valley of wind¨ , ¨Howl's moving castle¨ , ¨Laputa castle of the sky¨ ,¨Porco Rosso¨ , ¨Kiki's delivery service¨, ¨Chihiro¨ or ¨Spirited away¨: the highest grossing Japanese film ever , and this cult movie : ¨My neighbour Tororo¨ ."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","6","51","84","29 December 2015"," Where's the rest of it?
","It pains me to give it an average rating, but the fact that I wanted more of it proves that I was enjoying what we got before it came to an abrupt end. I was certain that I had accidentally hit the chapter skip button my remote, but nope, I did indeed watch the whole movie.<br/><br/>It's summer 1955 and very cute and curious 4-year-old Mei and her sister Satsuki move out into the country with their dad while their mother is in hospital. The creaky, dusty old house that they move into appears to be hot spot for forest spirits and magical creatures. As with all Hayao Miyazaki movies there is a heavy theme of nature being beautiful and the Earth being precious but where is the story?<br/><br/>Mei soon meets ""Totoro"" a giant cat/rabbit thing, who does...pretty much nothing. Totoro is barely IN the movie. I've seen pictures of him for years, I even carry around a Totoro satchel at work. I assumed that the movie would be filled with their wondrous discoveries, summertime adventures, and, y'know, some kind of PLOT! But nope. He's barely in it. Seriously, where is the rest of this film? I assume all those picture I saw were merely fan art and not stills from the actual film.<br/><br/>At one point Mei runs off to find her mother but gets lost on her way to the hospital. Satsuki enlists Totoro to help her and he summons the Catbus to locate Mei and take them both to the hospital and the film ends there. That's it! My jaw was on the floor when the credits began to roll, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>The animation is simply beautiful and is the perfect antidote to the ostentatious horror of modern CGI animated movies, the kids are cute, and Totoro (all 2 minutes he has on screen) is one of the most huggable characters ever created, but I am sorry I have to rate this on the lower rung of Miyazaki movies. There should have been more to this."
"esbenpe","9","8","10","9 March 2007"," Introduction to one of the greatest storytellers
","After seeing both Chihiro (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004), I instantly became a Miyazaki fan. I am especially fascinated by the mix of western and non-western mythological worlds, in which the different characters are developed. As a fan, it is IMO a must to see all of his films.<br/><br/>My Neighbor Totoro (1988) is one of his most beautiful and charming works, and I recommend this particular piece to first-time Miyazaki-viewers as an introduction to one of the greatest storytellers in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>While this story is simple and not as wildly imaginative as some of Miyazaki's recent works, the storyline has a slightly more emotional touch.<br/><br/>The story is about two sisters who are moving to the country side with their father  the mother being permanently in the hospital. The story takes off, when the youngest girl unintentionally falls down into a deep ravine and finds the protector of the forest - Totoro. Together with this wonderfully, flighty and friendly forest creature, the children experience one of the most fantastical journeys, physical as well mental.<br/><br/>If you have watched Miyazaki's latest productions you will know that his universe - social deliberated, humorous and ecological - appeals to children and adults alike. This is also most certainly the case with My Neighbor Totoro.<br/><br/>I give this movie 9/10, as it is one of the best family films ever made."
"JTurner82","10","8","10","7 March 2006"," A wonderful Miyazaki masterpiece in either version.
","What more can be said about MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO? Get this movie. Immediately. Without a doubt one of the best animated features ever made, Japan or otherwise, TOTORO is an outstanding original creation from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. It's about two sisters -- Satsuki and spunky little Mei -- moving with their somewhat scatterbrained but loving father to a new home in the Japanese countryside. But the place isn't just deserted; wonders galore lie within their household. Tiny, fuzzy black balls of soot (""Soot Gremlins"") scatter every nook and cranny of the walls, frightened away only by laughter. A tall, luscious camphor tree towers above the other trees in the back yard. And, lastly, the Totoros themselves, absolutely adorable little creatures who look like a cross between a raccoon, rabbit, owl, and guinea pig (a personal bias here, since I owned such a pet who reminds me so much of the Totoros here), live in this very forest, carrying acorns, making huge trees grow at night, and playing ocarinas on the branches of the trees. There is even one really BIG Totoro who sleeps under the tree, so cuddlesome and gentle that you'll swear that he's the equivalent of your pet. Of course, he doesn't just allow Mei to snuggle on his chest. He lets out thunderous roars, shake the ground by jumping with full force, grins as wide as a Cheshire cat (albeit with warmth and generosity), helps others when they're in trouble, and gives acorns wrapped in bamboo leaves in return for gifts. The story isn't all hearts and flowers, however. An emotionally charged subplot involving the sisters' ailing mother (shades of Miyazaki's personal life here) gives TOTORO a dramatic edge. This is particularly evident in the third act, when the girls receive a distressing telegram about their mother. Both Satsuki and Mei are extremely traumatized by this as any real child would be if such a situation occurred in their lifetime. What follows is a tearjerking sequence that builds to a truly happy ending. This mixture of real-life situations, emotions, and magical discoveries found in your nearest back yard make TOTORO feel authentic (even with its fantasy elements). One cannot help but find this quality in any of Miyazaki's films, this one included. <br/><br/>MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO was not a box office success in either Japan or America, but the film has won over millions of children around the world as well as animation buffs for its gorgeous animation style; the backgrounds are lavishly detailed and imagination is galore in much of the sequences. (It was KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE that would catapult Miyazaki's animation company, Studio Ghibli, into box office success status.) <br/><br/>The movie was originally dubbed into English by Carl Macek and his infamous company, Streamline Pictures in 1993. Believe it or not, this was one of the ""best"" dubs they've ever produced. As Disney has acquired the rights for Ghibli's movies, though, it was inevitable that they would produce their own version. This has infuriated many, but as someone who fell in love with TOTORO with the Mecak version, I have to say that this new Disney production offers charm and emotion on its own ground. The script is a fresh new translation from the original Japanese (clarifying the origin of Totoro's name), and remains faithful to the meaning of Miyazaki's screenplay, despite a few line changes here and there (nothing major, though). At first, I was a little worried about hearing Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, but both ended up captivating me from the start; personally, I think it was great for Disney to cast two actual sisters to play the young girls--it helps their chemistry come alive. The other actors, including a warm, understated Tim Daly, and delightful Lea Salonga provide similarly top quality work. My favorite performances? Pat Carroll, displaying maternal charm and whimsy as Granny (not sounding anything like her most-famous role, Ursula from THE LITTLE MERMAID), and Frank Welker, who does outstanding vocal foley for both Totoro and the Cat Bus. The OP and ED songs have the same lyrics, but are sung by a different singer (Sonya Isaacs), who may please some and annoy others. I'm sure that there will be many who will draw comparisons between the two dubs to the very bitter end, but I think it's great to have more than one adaptation of a beloved story, especially when done by folks who obviously love Miyazaki's works.<br/><br/>As far as the long awaited 2-DVD set from Disney goes, the widescreen visual transfer is absolutely gorgeous--Miyazaki's visuals really shine with pristine clarity on the screen, and the Japanese language track features literal subtitles, too. The extras are the same-old voice talent featurette, storyboards, and trailer we saw on most of the other Disney-Ghibli DVDs, which is sparse to say the least, but better than nothing.<br/><br/>Folks who want the old dub will obviously flock to the FOX pan & scan DVD, but personally, I'd suggest getting both the FOX and Disney releases--the former for nostalgia, the latter for a more professional sounding upgrade. Either way, however, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is far from just another kid's story. With a little bit of luck, grown-ups (and those who consider themselves too ""sophisticated"" for cartoons) will enjoy it too."

","After watching this film i was so overwhelmed by happiness and i just marvelled at the cuteness of it all. Totoro is beautifully drawn timeless touching, adorable film which will just enlighten you, regardless of age. I've seen this movie around, say, 8 times? I've watched it every year since i was 4 and it's the kind of movie that just puts this massive smile on your face.<br/><br/>The protagonists are sisters Satsuki and Mei. They have just moved from the city with their father into the countryside while he writes a book and their mother is suffering from an unknown disease in a hospital nearby. The girls explore the surrounding wilderness and have an encounter with Totoro, a cuddly, cute, fat, imaginary forest 'spirit'. Totoro can only be seen by the girls and even then, only occasionally. The movie does not have an ongoing perpetual plot but it doesn't need to. Its an endearing story about a few months in the life of two young sisters. There is no clear villain the the film. The dad is not an uncaring workaholic, the mean kid next door isn't really that bad, and the somewhat scary old neighbor is kind and wise. Everyone has their good and bad points and Hayao miyazaki does a great job of showing them.<br/><br/>Though the movie is about the imagination of little kids, it has this incredible sense of reality. The little 4 year old is cute but loud and demanding like all young children. Satsuki, the elder sister, is protective over her little sister and a bit bossy. There is a scene of a boy playing with a toy trying to avoid a chore. Despite the fact that it is such a calm movie, when a crisis occurs, you're at the edge of the seat, worrying, because the movie, unlike most animated films, it luckily lacks that element of ""There's Always going to be a Happy Ending"" The drawing is great. Its so natural and there are these scenes of wonderful sereneness. It's just so pleasant to watch. I just hate kids, but every single time after watching this movie, I just feel like hugging every little girl I see. I think it is impossible for anyone not to like Totoro because it is just this incredible masterpiece that erases any doubt in mankind. I can't come close to putting the wonders of this movie in words, and all i have to say is watch it!"
"monkeydisco89","10","6","7","22 October 2010"," My favorite animated feature
","Hayao Miyazaki is a genius. Most critics and moviegoers will second that notion. My Neighbor Totoro, one of his earlier features, is evidence of that claim. On several occasions when recommending this film to friends they have asked me, ""Well, what is the movie about?"" And, well, that is mostly hard to explain. There is no set plot, structure, nor is there much conflict; the film simply follows the lives of two little girls that meet the King of the Forest, Totoro. The film is from the perspective of a child, which, in my opinion, is the core of this film's brilliance. You can't help but watch the film without being imbued with a sense of jubilant wonder, joy, and warmth. This movie is older than I am, but still feels new and original. Everything from the music to the scenery to the dialogue is top-notch. I would recommend getting the 2005 English version with Dakota and Elle Fanning, Pat Carroll and Tim Daly, though both English dubbings are great."
"rsa5387","10","6","7","17 August 2008"," Essential Viewing
","I was initially skeptical on the quality of this one, but surprisingly this film was both engaging and beautiful from start to finish. Loosely based on Miyazakis own childhood, My Neighbor Totoro is a simplistic story with a kind of charm, depth, and broad appeal that makes it irresistible. When two girls move to a new farmhouse to be closer to their ailing mother, they have to deal with some of life's more eccentric experiences, that of impending death and incredible magic. At its heart, its about the uninhibited curiosity of childhood, and the innocence in accepting everything without question, to such an extent that magic is a very real reality. The otherworldly in this film, comes in the form of Totoro, an animal spirit who is the guardian of the forest near the girls home. Overall, this film is absolutely spectacular. Kids will love it, though some of the deeper meaning will be lost on them. Adults will also love it, as a nostalgic ride through childhood and for some of the more profound themes running throughout the film. Technically, though made in 1988, the animation in this film looks every bit as stunning today. Totoros forest and the many quiet landscape shots are absolutely gorgeous. Disney, eat your heart out. The film is paced slow, letting the film unfurl at a relaxing pace through its scant 86 minute runtime. The lethargic pace, along with Miyazakis expressive camera pans and attention to detail lend the girls discovery of their home/the forest, the famous cat bus scene, and every moment with Totoro a very 360 degree, hypnotic feel. The new English dub is well done without losing much in translation, retaining the witty and lighthearted exchanges from the original. Overall, this films serves as a great introduction into the world of Miyazaki, and remains a timeless classic in its own right. Miyazakis most lighthearted venture also remains his most introspective and grounded work. Even without the whimsicality of Spirited Away and Kikis Delivery Service, this is by far his most engaging and charming film. Essential viewing."
"refresh_daemon","8","6","7","15 November 2006"," A remarkably enjoyable film
","I keep watching Studio Ghibli films like this one expecting that in all the films that they've made, there's got to be one that just doesn't hold up. Well, My Neighbor Totoro isn't that one.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful and exuberant story story about a pair of kids that move into the country with their father and meet some of the less visible residents, including some lively dustbunnies and the giant Totoro. Although this could just be a story about kids meeting the magical residents of their rural community, the story deals a lot with the relationship between the two young sisters and their parents as well.<br/><br/>One thing that's absolutely charming about this film is the realness of the relationship between the sisters, with the younger Mei commonly copying her older sister Satsuki, getting upset and bratty and unreasonable in addition to being ridiculously cute at times, while Satsuki gets worried and dutiful. It makes some interesting observations about different family roles and I found myself surprised at how it made me re-examine my role in my family.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say it's a remarkably deep film, but the little observations that it makes causes it to be a lot more than just simple children's entertainment. The characters are complex and multi-faceted and surprisingly real for animated images.<br/><br/>The voice acting in English is decent, but still doesn't fully connect with the Japanese dressing. Hearing a ""Yes!"" in English just doesn't have the same sort of exuberance that the Japanese kid shouting ""Hai!"" has. But it's good enough that the dubbed soundtrack won't be distracting.<br/><br/>All in all, I have to say this is a remarkably enjoyable film and wonderful for children and the older folks that watch with them. (As well as the child in you.) 8/10."
"gracegibson","10","7","9","4 June 2005"," Another Stunning Work from Hayao Miyazaki
","I first saw this movie when I was very, very young. I loved it then and I love it now. It is like a beautiful painting. The visuals are fantastic, the plot charming, and the ""totoros"" are adorable (not to mention Mei). Miyazaki has refused to follow in the footsteps of other Japanese film-makers and do those awful anime movies that are, unfortunately, popular among many of my friends. Instead, he has made animated films that look and are captivating. I love how he did the fantasy element in this movie, with the totoros flying and doing magical wonders and Satsuki and Mei looking like they're having the time of their life. My favorite part is when Satsuki and Mei sneak outside to see the totoros and they make the trees grow (and their father has no clue!). The enchanting music during that part was what made it memorable. A must-see for all little kids."

","You know when you're a kid and you just want to be independent? You want to become an adult once and for all? And later on when you're there realize that being a kid was the best moment of your life? This movie, plus its great OST achieves making me nostalgic, making me feel like a little kid again. Yes, you have these high budget animated movies like The Lion King, but they're movies for kids, not a movie to make you feel that nostalgia. My Neighbor Totoro's main theme captures this perfectly. If you could only go back to those beautiful times, when nothing mattered, wen you could play all day and run around the house...

","Last night, I went to a rave party. Because of that, I can't sleep tonight, even as tomorrow is my birthday. So I decided to watch some anime. Tonari no Totoro had been given a very nice average score here at imdb, so I settled for it. It seems fortune itself has decided to give me this birthday present that is the pure joy of watching this movie. <br/><br/>I mentioned in a review of another anime (Kiki's Delivery Service), that it reminded me of Astrid Lindgren's ""Pippi Longstockings"" which I was fed with as a swedish child. This movie is just about as fine! It gives me an insight of what it must've been like to be a child growing up at the countryside in the japanese 50s (which I guess is the setting for this movie), and at the same time it reminds me of what it was like for myself to grow up back when I lived in a house in the suburbs of Stockholm with a fairly large garden.<br/><br/>I started smiling after watching this movie for about ten minutes, then I kept on smiling unto the worrying part (you will know what I mean if you have seen/will see the movie). How about that, by the way? An anime for kids that gets a 22-year old like me worried when the plot becomes saddening? Anyway, when the credits started rolling by with a beautiful, playful song in the background, I was smiling once again. This movie deserves no other grade than a 10, and that's what I'm about to give it :)<br/><br/><ul><li>Johan</li></ul>"
"zh84","10","8","11","16 March 2007"," The most charming film I have EVER seen!
","This film is intended for small children, so Miyazaki says. I was thirty-six when I watched it. I was so charmed that I showed it again to my father, who was then seventy-seven. He was so charmed that he insisted we must show it to his grandson, who is four. I have seen more exciting films, or funnier films, but none which gave me more sheer delight. It is a great shame the world isn't really as nice as this, but when you are four, like Mei, or even eleven, like Satsuki, this is how you want it to be: everyone bigger is kind and can be trusted completely, and everything always comes right in the end. Knowing a little boy of Mei's age I can vouch for her being highly realistic, from the obsessive looking through a hole in a bucket to the scowling and sulking! The most touching moment is when Catbus' destination board changes to ""MEI"", showing Satsuki that he knows exactly where her little sister is, and that he's going to take her straight there. My only criticisms, if you can call them that, are that the DVD doesn't contain the legendary sequel ""Mei and the Kittenbus"", in which Mei meets and goes for a ride with Catbus's little son, and that I can't ride in Catbus myself. As a cat lover and occasional bus user I feel I was born to do that, and it's a disgrace he's only imaginary!"
"jzappa","8","6","8","6 May 2009"," Miyazaki's Absolutely Hilarious, Culturally Significant Story of Existence, Location and Expedition, Rather Than Rivalry and Danger.
","This culturally significant Kodomo anime has become one of the most endeared of all family films without ever having been much popularized or sponsored, which is a testament to its magic. This is one of the tenderly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki, perhaps the greatest of the Japanese animators, yet his collaborator at the Ghibli Studios, Isao Takahata, who fashioned Grave of the Fireflies, may be his rival. Miyazaki has not until quite lately used computers to animate his films. They are drawn a frame at a time, the time-honored way, with the master himself providing tens of thousands of the frames.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's films are in particular viscerally entrancing, using a watercolor look for the backgrounds and working within the unique anime tradition of characters with big round eyes and mouths that can be as minute as a fleck or as enormous as a cave. They also have an spontaneous authenticity in the way they mind minutiae.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of two young sisters who share a wonderful bond. As it opens, their father is driving them to their new house, near a boundless forest. Their mother, who is ill, has been moved to a hospital in this community. Now think about that. The film is about two girls, not two boys or a boy and a girl, as all American cartoon films would be. It has a resolute and loving father, in contradiction to the recent Hollywood affinity for selfish or absent fathers. Their mother is sick: Does sickness happen in American family cartoons?<br/><br/>A neighbor boy later tells them their new house is haunted. But not haunted in the American sense, with ghosts or forbidding creations. When the girls let light into the shadow, they get just a peek of little black fuzzy dots scampering to refuge. ''Probably just dust bunnies,'' says their father, but there is an old nanny who has been employed to look after them, and she suggests that they are ''soot sprites,'' which like empty houses, and will pack up and leave when they hear laughter. Perhaps I'm reading too much in, but during this scene, I feel like I caught a brief reference to Ingmar Bergman's Through a Glass Darkly, as one sister stares transfixed at a crack in the wall.<br/><br/>Assent to how the father composedly receives their account of arcane critters. Are sprites and totoros for real? They surely do in the minds of the girls. So do other hilarious beasts, such as the Cat Bus, which bustles through the forest on eight fast paws, its big eyes working as headlights. Instead of letting the children be scared of hauntings and the soundness of their own minds, the elders teach them to like and enjoy it all. They go along with it rather than irrationally making them feel silly.<br/><br/>While it's not necessarily clear whether or not the adults actually consider them, not once does Miyazaki trot out the relic children's literature adage of The Adults Who Think The Child Is A Liar, So Child Is Going To Have To Save The World Without Them. This welcoming approach to accustomed Japanese spirit-creatures imparts a telling distinction between our two cultures. In America, there must always be something to fear, always a scapegoat, always something or someone to antagonize. No matter how equally violent or aggressive the history is of Japan, they do not thrive on fear factors. It is a beacon of great hope and pleasure to me that family films are the rudimentary place where cultural difference is easiest to discern in the movies.<br/><br/>My Neighbor Totoro is made of existence, location and expedition, not on rivalry and danger. This is made crystal in the engrossingly extensive sequences involving totoros, which actually are not Japanese myth, but were indeed created by Miyazaki specifically for this movie. In these sequences, Miyazaki gets no mileage out of any trite ideas about the dark and dreadful forest. It's only nature. Is the film sometimes corny and absurd? Yes, but it knows when to be quiet and real.<br/><br/>One of the funniest scenes I think I've ever seen on film occurs when the girls go to meet their father's bus. But the hour grows late and the woods grow dark. Without a sound, matter-of-factly, the giant totoro joins them at the bus stop, standing to one side as if it's been there the whole time. It starts to rain. The girls have umbrellas, and give one to the totoro, who is fascinated by the raindrops on the umbrella, and jumps up and down to render free a downrush of drops from the trees. Watch how coolly and constructively the scene has been handled, with the night, the forest, the lateness of the father seen as a circumstance, not an omen. The movie needs no villains. I remember that Winnie the Pooh also had no evil characters at first, but that in its new American version evil weasels have been interposed into his benevolent setting.<br/><br/>But it would never have won its worldwide audience simply owing to its fuzzy heart. It is also full of mortal humor in the manner in which it perceives the two exceptionally authentic, realistic little girls, and I refer to their characterizations, not their physicality. It is side- splitting in the scenes involving the totoro, and in the scenes with the ridiculous Cat Bus. It is a little tearful, a little hair-raising, a little out of the blue and a little enlightening, just like life itself. The film expresses a refreshing ideology with Miyazaki later deepens and defines in his more recent films. Look at the minimal amount of external things in these girls' lives, or their father's, or the nanny's. Their story exists as a situation rather than a plot, and suggests that the uncertainty of life and the makeshifts of invention afford all the enterprising escapades one needs."
"WolfHai","10","4","5","6 April 2008"," A wonderful movie!
","The movie is from Japan and it is 20 years old -- it feels fresh as if done yesterday and there is no cultural barrier whatsoever. The drawings of the landscape are fantastic and are alone worth watching this movie: the reflection of the sun on the leaves of the trees, the reflection of the sky in the rice paddies, the high summer clouds, the flowers detailed and colorful.<br/><br/>Two girls, maybe four and ten, move with their father into their new house in this landscape. How they discover, befriend, and master their new environment is shown in a detailed, loving, but not sentimental way. Watching these girls create their own adventures and act and react in them, is delightful. Even more, they reveal something deeply human; and the audience can rediscover its own humanness by watching and identifying with them."
"DICK STEEL","10","4","5","10 June 2007"," A Nutshell Review: (DVD) My Neighbor Totoro (1988)
","I have never sat through a complete Hayao Miyazaki animated movie despite all the good vibes, reviews, recommendations I got from friends. Actually I have Spirited Away on DVD just waiting to be watched, but for some reason it still sits on my desk amongst others. Well, a good friend from up north passed me THREE Miyazaki DVDs, and given I'm going to where he is tomorrow visiting someone who mentioned during a visit to the previous movie set, how the scene was reminiscent of My Neighbor Totoro, I thought I'll pop that DVD and give it a watch.<br/><br/>I was blown away. This IS animation, with a story suitable for kids to understand, and for adults to get a kick out of given its fantastical pieces. I shan't spoil the movie by spelling out the storyline, but suffice to say it centers very simply on a family, the father a professor who has recently uprooted his family of two girls, Satsuki and Mai, to the countryside, to provide a healthier environment for their ailing mom, currently in the hospital, to recuperate in. Thus begins the children's adventures in the country, with its lush greenery, and of course, with their new found friend, a giant ghibil known as Totoro, with seemingly magical powers of flight and fantasy.<br/><br/>And it is in its simplicity where its beauty shines through. It is always said that children can see things that adults don't, and hence, there's a constant question as to whether Totoro is real, or not, and if so, how its interactions with the kids are possible. It's not just Totoro itself which is out of this world, but I totally like that grinning cat-bus.<br/><br/>This is the kind of animated movie that our local animation production houses should be looking at. First and foremost, the story. While it doesn't contain huge battle sequences, complex or multiple characters for the sake of stuffing the movie, it goes to show that the story matters, in its ability to touch and resonate with audiences young and old (while the young ones go to the cinemas, don't forget the adults have to bring them too, and somehow you have to entertain them as well without being too complex for the little ones to understand).<br/><br/>The character designs are also kept simple, but nonetheless effective. The animation here is top notch despite it being 2D, as are the cast who voiced the characters. The acid test here is whether the movie can stand the test of time, and watching it close to 20 years after it was made, the answer is a resounding yes, it passed with flying colours. There are plenty of moments where you go ""so cute!"" without it being saccharine, or trying too hard, and that is indeed remarkable. Characterization is superb, especially Mai, whom I think everyone who has a kid sister, would be able to relate to. That's how realistic I thought she was!<br/><br/>Everything in this movie works well together, like a fine orchestra performing its pieces with precision yet with lots of heart. I do feel compelled to pop in and watch all the other Hayao Miyazaki DVDs I have in my collection, but I have to travel tomorrow and be away the next few days. You can be sure however, I will be back and complete watching them all real soon!<br/><br/>I like Tonari no Totoro, certainly one of the best movies I've seen!"
"MrVibrating","10","4","5","14 May 2006"," Extremely cute(in a good way!)
","If you see a movie like 'My Little Pony', you think ""CUTE!"" and feel like puking. That's a common trait in children's movies today. Too many bright colours, boring and dumbed-down dialog, and tired and boring concepts.<br/><br/>This usually stems from the problem that only grown-ups make movies. But this movie is also made by grown-ups. So what's so different? I think Miyazaki has very good contact with his inner child. It sounds corny, I know, but he's spot on with every line, every movement, in fact everything the wonderful two sisters do in this movie.<br/><br/>American child heroes are usually very grown-up. They speak pretty much like an adult. They remind more of the kind of children we see all the time in horror movies(the kind who has black makeup under the eyes and says eerie things to the main character) than real children. If they're not like that, they're painfully cute and stupid. But not in this movie.<br/><br/>The plot is wonderful as well. It's magical enough to appeal the children and serious enough to affect grown-ups. It's a rare mix. Most importantly, it's gripping. You really care for the characters, you feel happy when they're happy and you feel bad when they're in danger.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Totoro is a really cute movie but not in the usual brain-dead way we Westerners have become used to. It's as good as Disney in its prime, and in some ways better. It's easily the best movie you can let you children watch made in the latest 20 years. Mom and Dad might want to turn off the dubbing and watch the Japanese version as well."
"MartinHafer","10","4","5","24 June 2005"," I loved the film but know there are now three versions on video in the USA
","Although so many reviews have been written here for the movie, I am including one because there are now 3 different video versions of this movie and all three are certainly worth watching.<br/><br/>Originally in the United States, 20th Century Fox released the movie on video in the early 90s. This is the version I first saw. Then, a few years later, Studio Ghibli (who made this film in Japan) signed a deal for exclusivity with Disney. This has resulted in a more widespread release of their pictures but has also recently resulted in a new dubbed version of the movie. The Disney version has, perhaps, more realistic voices--as the children sound more like kids. However, I prefer the original voices--particularly the voice for Mei. I think it's the same lady who does the voice of Angelica on Rugrats.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the original Japanese version that is subtitled into English. I am a bit compulsive and actually have seen all three versions! I think the subtitled is best because there are also a few tiny scenes that are in neither dubbed versions (not enough to change the story, but still I prefer a complete film). Of the dubbed, my loyalty is to the Fox version--it just sounds more charming and cute.<br/><br/>Now about the movie itself, the animation is about the best you'll find anywhere--particularly the gorgeous backgrounds. They seem to yell out ""QUALITY PRODUCTION"" throughout. The story, though very simple, is very captivating and the emotional response the film triggers is amazing. Anyone (except a total curmudgeon) will love this charming and simple film. See the movie, as it's about as good an animated film as you can find--regardless of where it was made."

A somewhat embarrassing moment for me, but I think few of the 500-odd crowd would have disagreed.<br/><br/>It must surely rate somewhere at the apex of the cartoonist's art. The scenes are magnificently detailed, and the action portrays real humans of the kind we all know and love, seamlessly moving into the fantastic realms that we would all _like_ to know and love.<br/><br/>Aside from the beautiful artwork, the music supports the action all the way through, and there are several good stories woven into the movie as well.<br/><br/>The copy I saw was subtitled in excellent English and some of the younger audience may have trouble with that, although they would probably still find the movie very enjoyable."

","Hands down, 'My Neighbour Totoro' is far superior to any film ever produced by Disney and that's including my personal favourites 'The Lion King' and 'Hercules'.<br/><br/>It revolves around two young girls Satsuki (aged around eight) and Mei (aged around three) who move to a new house while also coping with their mother's illness in the resilient, sweet way young children have in dealing with problems. They then discover these furry totoro creatures only ever seen by children and through their new friends, they are able to face their fears.<br/><br/>You can actually feel the magic when you watch this. The totoros are adorable and their haunting silence only intensifies their beauty and the two children are so innocent and captivating that you completely empathise with their delight at meeting these fabled creatures.<br/><br/>Although I watched it a few times when I was around 12, I rediscovered this in Disney Land (Disney own the rights now) and walked from the Britain exhibit in EPCOT back to Japan to buy the cuddly Totoro toy which is now my most prized possession from that Florida holiday. At the moment, this excellent film is not on DVD in Britain for some criminal reason, I hope now that Disney own it they will release it soon enough. I would certainly reccommend it to anyone of any age."
"Munster2000","5","20","39","16 December 2015"," Left Underwhelmed
","The animation style is what you would expect from Studio Ghibli, which I really enjoy. This movie is meant to be a sort of slice of life film, which I don't mind either. The main two characters have enjoyable personalities as well. This brings us to why the 5/10.<br/><br/>To be plain and simple, I found the movie extremely boring. Watching a movie such as Spirited Away or Kiki's Delivery Service, you will notice that they're rather relaxing and aren't paced that fast but you knew the movie was building to something. That is one of the major reasons why I like Ghibli films and what I was expecting again with My Neighbor Totoro. Unfortunately that was not the case and I was left wondering when the movie was going to climax or what adversity the characters are going to face.<br/><br/>I was left disappointed that the characters that i started to like during the beginning of the film never really changed or learned some sort of lesson. At the end of the day, I was left underwhelmed especially since I have heard nothing but good things about this movie from anyone who mentions it."
"popculturethoughts","6","5","7","1 December 2018"," Pop Culture Thoughts

That trend continues with ""My Neighbor Totoro"" after disappointing experiences with ""Spirited Away"" and ""Ponyo"" - while I find the animation and music absolutely gorgeous and charming, Miyaaki's narratives leave me indifferent and rather bored, even though I find a few moments entertaining here and there. Just not my jam I guess."

The film respectfully portrays so many slippery nuances of childhood--powerful emotions, unexpected perceptions, and secret worlds of adventure. I think our baby might like it because it's helping him learn how to be a little kid. He loves the music, the tree, the baby girl Mei, the Dad, the catbus, and especially the totoro (although this is also the scariest part for him).<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film for anyone except adolescents, who might find it sort of dull and goody-goody."

"Jens-ar","10","5","8","21 June 2008"," Subtle and poetic
","Two little girls, Satsuki and Mei, moves into an old house in the Japanese country with their father. Their sick mother is at the hospital. The two kids meet the gentle and flute playing Totoro, a hybrid between a gigantic rodent and a bear. The movie's style is quite different from most Western animations, and only a few Disney movies can hold their own to Tonari no Totoro's amazing and poetic expression. The bus stop scene is brilliant, and so are many other similar scenes where only few words are spoken. Disney animations are often too restless to create an atmosphere like this. Pardoxically the two children are a bit stereotypical at times, but in the end of the movie they become more complex. At this point in the film a cryptic message from the mother's hospital, makes the children suspect that their mother has died. After an intense drama they are being flown to the hospital in Totoro's bizarre cat bus. But it turns out that the mother has only had a cold and that she's going to comeback to them soon. This is, though a foundation for a happy ending, a bit of an anticlimax. I couldn't help but wonder if the movie would be better if the mother was dead from the start of the film. Not that I'm a sadist, but as it is, the children are living a great life in a beautiful place, and when their mother comes back, all is practically well, this would make it seem so perfect, that you don't feel like you have to pity the kids, which makes their attempt in finding comfort in their friendship with Totoro less touching than it could be. If the mother was dead, the movie would probably touch some deeper feelings. But this is only a thought. However, a psychological interpretation could be that the mother really is dying, and Totoro only is a delusion made by the children in their grief. But this would however be too cruel. Perhaps the perfectly happy ending is the best way to end the film, though a sad future awaits the children when they get too old to see Totoro. Though I'm not a big fan of the manga style I must admit that it's masterfully animated, and the imaginative pictures make the movie seem like a beautiful dream."

My Neighbor Totoro is simple but still imaginative like all his works, and it is quite simply a masterpiece. Even though Totoro doesn't seems he wanted to be lovable, even though he looks scary because of his huge eyes and large mouth, he remains to be one of the loveliest characters of Hayao Miyazaki, quiet but unforgettable, he is like a Teddy Bear. If Satsuki and Mai was amazed when they saw Totoro the first time, well I'm astonished when I saw the half-cat, half-bus creature, it is magical to see that. He didn't go far in this one, but it's the first film that I've seen from him that has a heart."

It is apparently simple, made up of the tiny, everyday events in a child's life, but unlike many films for and about children, it doesn't ignore the huge shadows those events cast in the imagination. Some critics have said that not much happens in My Neighbor Totoro, but discovering a new world, learning the cycle of nature, and facing up to the fear of death is more than enough action to sustain a film, especially in director Hayao Miyazaki's hands. The film is, of course, breathtakingly beautiful. The action may be small-scale but the vistas are incredible. Joe Hisaishi creates what may well be his greatest ever score, another miracle of seeming simplicity. In terms of story, design, animation, and music, this film achieves its aims so perfectly that it's almost absurd to give it a rating. Miyazaki set the film in the remembered landscape of his own childhood. Never sentimental, never dishonest, never preaching, and never failing to acknowledge the realities of life, he has made a film with more magic in it than any number of wizards and superheroes could create. The film became so popular that Studio Ghibli adopted Totoro as the company mascot."
"Quinoa1984","10","3","4","11 June 2006"," My Neighbor Totoro turned me into a little squish-ball, and I mean that as a compliment
","That one line summary refers to, basically, what it feels like to be a kid and get delighted by a story and characters that are (to use an overused word) enchanting. In fact, this film to me represents the kind of enjoyment I had as a very young tot watching the Winnie the Pooh films. It is so in touch with the innocence and escapism of children that it actually works for the adults too. As a man already in his twenties, I was really taken aback by how adorable all of the little woodland creatures are- the ""King"" Totoro, the Cat bus, the other little creatures alongside him- and how it wasn't annoying or nearing that. This is the kind of Japanese-export that puts an entertainment like Pokemon, which is all about conflict and defeat and trying to save the end of everything from some super-chu or whatever, as the fun if shallow stuff that it is. Here is a story that works much more like a fairy tale, where there is almost no real conflicts that are impending or spelling deep trouble, only the exaggerated thoughts and occasionally distraught emotions of kids 4-10 years old. Hayao Miyazaki is really, truly in touch with these feelings that go about with kids like these.<br/><br/>If anything might be lacking in the film it's a 'plot' or sorts, as there really isn't any- a story it does have, however loose with what goes on. It's a pure kind of feel-good story about two young girls who have moved into a new house with their father so they can be closer to their mother who's at a hospital. After finding their house might be haunted, the younger of the two Mei searches around a gigantic tree to find Totoro and his buddies, who help make things grow in nature and are generally just there to act like fuzz-balls. Aside from a bit of trouble that arises in the third act, which does hold some overall significance to the implicit message in the film, it's really got nothing on its agenda except to give the little kids a big smile and some laughs in some of the cuter, odder moments. If some American kids might not get it or latch on to it like the homegrown animation of late, it might still work for their parents probably watching it with them.<br/><br/>And this message I mentioned- which is also connected with Winnie the Pooh on some fundamental level- is that its essential to have this kind of lively dream-life for children, to have a section of the world just for them where nothing bad or upsetting can protrude through. But, like Miyazaki's other films, this isn't a message crammed down the kids throats. It's also for me (damned if I'll say it as a guy who's usually into more mature dramas and such) one of the most charming and cute pieces of animation to ever come out of Japan, and I would give it such a recommendation that the Pooh movies meant for me- as a first movie for a little one to see and maybe get addicted to."

","I love this movie for the following reasons. First, the characters are very very cute. Mei has pure heart and she believes in natural wonders. Satsuki is kind and always think of Mei. Above all Totoro's big and round eyes are incredibly wonderful. Second, music is good. Heart-warming music fits the movie혖fs warm atmosphere. I saw the Lilo&Stitch shortly before I saw Tonari-no-Totoro. Lilo&Stitch's score has strong impacts, but I like soft music in Totoro. I can recommend this movie to all mothers and children.<br/><br/>They can learn how valuable a family is through this movie.<br/><br/>I rate this movie at 8/10"

And its score really goes well with the country scenery in this movie.<br/><br/>The music reminds us of our happy and good old childhood.<br/><br/>This movie is more peaceful than Disney's Lilo and Stitch though it is also about two sisters.

The music and words are also perfect for the story. It makes me feel really excited. The story teaches me the importance of love and dream! Lilo & Stich produced by Disney, Tonari no Totoro produced by Gyibli are similar in that in both sisters appear. But, Tonari no Ttoro doesn혖ft have any offensive scene and is more full of love and dream. I really want to meet Totoro & Nekobus to return to my childhood! I recommend this film to all people.

"rbverhoef","8","3","4","16 May 2004"," A great animated film
","Most animated movies, for children and adults, have a hero or heroes and at least one great villain. With 'My Neighbor Totoro' it is different. This movie shows us a wonderful world of animation without a villain. This does not mean the movie is boring or nothing is happening. A lot is happening. There is comedy, drama and suspense but this movie does not need a villain. The only villain there probably is, is the illness the mother of Satsuki (Noriko Hidaka) and Mei (Chika Sakamoto) suffers.<br/><br/>I can be short about the story. A father moves with his two daughters to a new home, close to his wife who is sick. The children discover spirits in the forest, not visible for adults. An adventure with the children and the spirits is what follows, with Totoro as the leading spirit.<br/><br/>'My Neighbor Totoro' with its friendly and original story is entertaining from start to finish. Hayao Miyazaki, the great Japanese animator, has created a wonderful world with his imagination and animation. Definitely recommended."

","I have never been so happy whilst watching a film, after a film and even at the beginning of a film. I found myself smiling all the way through. The characters are all so lovable, I marvel at Hayao miyazaki's ability to create something truly imaginative out of every standard object. The film is visually beautiful and wondrous. What was also heart warming was the relationship between the father, mother and kiddies, it's everybody's ideal family unit. It reflected well the older sister younger sister relationship, leaving the viewer feeling very nostalgic. The cat embodied everything that a child desires from a companion. The film managed to capture the world that children live in and take you back to what it felt like to be a child living in your own idealist environment. Basically i feel it's impossible for anybody to watch this film and be left feeling cold. It warms you from your toes to the tip of your head, you'll be smiling for days."
"muathuvn","10","4","6","25 September 2005"," The best animated movie ever
","I love Totoro, Mei and Satsuki. I have been seeing the movie many times without getting bored while I become tired of seeing other movies easily right at the second or third time. I can't imagine how the director can create such real and cute characters. Notice the way Mei goes upstairs and downstairs, showing Myazaki to be very observant about children's actions. They are amazing compared to conventional move of Waldisney's as well as of many other animated movies. The movie is a simple story with normal circumstances of daily life, about a family with 4 members, the father is a university professor, the mother is in hospital because of suffering from a disease unknown and the two children of 10 and 4 years old are still very innocent. The family is as ordinary as most of real families around us but described within several selective days. That is when they move to a new house in the beautiful countryside. The fresh scene encourages the two children to discover everything they see and this leads them to meeting with Totoro. Totoro is only a character of imagination but more real than any other imagined characters. He looks like a bear and may symbol children's belief in good things of life. One of the scenes i like best is that of the three people bathing together when a very serious storm goes through the area, shaking the house and scaring the two children, so warm. And the scenes of field, hills remind me of my childhood as if it was just yesterday. For me this is Myazaki's best animated movie and one of the best animations of all time. Voted it 10 stars."
"pagliani-p","3","12","26","6 January 2019"," That's it?
","I really don't get it.. why all these critics praise this kind of movie that are totally without plot.. it won't deliver no emotions at all. Completely waste of time. At least it's only 90 minutes long. It looks like a Sunday morning animated tv show that cliffhanger you to the episode of the next week.. in this case an episode that you cannot (luckily) see."
"A_Kind_Of_CineMagic","4","17","44","31 October 2013"," A very over rated film in my opinion
","I apologise to the seemingly massive fanbase for these Miyazaki films but I find them totally over praised.<br/><br/>I cannot see what people find so amazing about them. The scripts are totally banal and unnatural with nothing that makes me feel any emotion or humour. I find the dialogue boring and idiotic to be honest.<br/><br/>Yes the animation is what must attract people mainly I guess but is it just me or is it no better than the weird cartoons I used to watch on kids TV in the 80s like Ulysees, City of Gold or Thundercats? I just would accept it as a kid in the 80s and it is not terrible but while quirky it is neither clever nor realistic nor beautiful. I am not impressed.<br/><br/>The stories are mostly weird. In this case again the film is weird and unengaging for me. I cannot see why people rate it so highly. The characters are uninteresting and the script is robotic. The quirky animation and story is all that I can see to attract people but I find it a big turn off. I feel it appeals to the kind of computer game playing, does not leave their bedroom type of geek who has not grown up. It is neither for children nor for adults which is my main disconnect I think. Just my opinion."
"GiraffeDoor","3","7","16","16 March 2019"," What the hell? This isn't for kids.
","My problem with this movie is simple. There's just not enough conflict.<br/><br/>I am a grown man who has never outgrown stuff made for children. I actually really like ""Masha and the Bear"" and ""Charlie and Lola"".<br/><br/>But this movie just annoys me. The girls are happy in their new home, no one seems to be discontent or threatened, there is admittedly a sick mother but we only see her in a state of convalescence. It feels like a TV show aimed at young children right before bedtime but with the pretence of being worthy of a feature length running time.<br/><br/>There is some stuff to like. There's some cuteness and a lot of well imagined sequences and images that feel instantly iconic (shame about the cheesy music) and I can appreciate that this movie isn't trying to be riveting story telling but something sweet, idyllic and simple.<br/><br/>Totoru himself doesn't really do much and the climax feels really tacked-on. I thought Twilight had a tacked-on ending after not having nearly enough real conflict or high stakes but at least Twilight (in its defence) uses its climax to explore its major themes and is only the first part of a tetralogiy.<br/><br/>Bland story, characters and themes aside, this could be the perfect movie for someone who had undergone a traumatic experience and is recovering in hospital. It's really not challenging at all except in how audaciously unchallenging it is.<br/><br/>5 year old me might have just about enjoyed parts of this. 10 year old me would have completely dismissed this movie for its lack of antagonist or a real story.<br/><br/>it's not a classic to enjoy with your children."
"suzunaho","9","3","5","26 June 2006"," No impractical !!
","I like this movie very much. Particularly I love the unique atmosphere in this movie's world. I think all of Miyazaki's films are unique. But this movie is most heart-warming one of his works. I would like to tell you why. First of all the story is almost realistic. In other words, it is about our ordinary life. We can see Japan's typical countryside and an ordinary life whenever we see the film, we feel peaceful. For even those who live in a big city, the movie might have relaxation effects? Second its music and pictures are very enchanting. Maybe almost all the Japanese know ""Sanpo"" -Totoro's theme song- the song is very very famous. It always makes us happy.The pictures are also popular. All characters have tender facial expression. I love their smiles. Everyone like them, don't they? Third, There are many silent without conversation. In such a scene, I can hear the song of birds, sounds of wind. I feel comfortable and calm .It is really Miyazaki's world. This movie will give you gentle, comfortable and calm mind. I can recommend this movie to everyone. Particularly I want to recommend this movie to those who are busy everyday. Maybe this movie makes such people smile."

"Zoopansick","3","24","78","21 May 2006"," I dare your five-year old not to be bored
","This is supposedly one of the ""Great Movies"" according to Roger Ebert...My tone in the previous sentence should suffice for my review, but I feel like more needs to be said. My Neighbor Totoro isn't offensive, obnoxious, disturbing, annoying, or irritating in any way. And as Ebert continually points out in his review, it doesn't fall in line with a lot of clichés that are prevalent in American cartoons in terms of characterization or plot-line. This may all be true; but it doesn't make up for it's fatal flaw...it's boring. It's really really, boring. There is hardly any plot other then these 2 girls hanging around their house out in the country side. The title character makes his first appearance 30 minutes in, and only a couple of times after that. He doesn't do much either. In his debut scene he sleeps and yawns...how appropriate. Later he does some other stuff but it's not too exciting and perhaps only mildly so compared to the doldrum of the girls lives. I wasn't ""enchanted"", the world didn't seem that magical to me, and with the lack of any compelling plot I couldn't help but once again become baffled by the godly praise for this movie. The animation is OK but don't see why Miyazaki's work is considered to be THAT much better then everyone else's. Perhaps you have to be an anime aficionado to understand why. Perhaps you have to be an anime aficionado to love this movie. I can think of no other reason why. Granted, I'm 23 and cartoons don't hold the same appeal as they did 15 years ago. But that being said, I can't see myself even sitting through this 15 years ago. And as an adult, it doesn't seem to hold much value. There is no plot, the writing is forgettable, and I don't find it's artistic value to be any higher then that of any other anime. Bottom line, if you are an anime fan, you aren't even reading this because you own My Neighboro Totoro on DVD and are probably waiting for the special edition. However, if you are checking up on one of the ""Great Movies"" or if you a parent and want to show your kid something, I can't recommend it to you on either level."
"Deshra_Dine","10","4","8","24 August 2007"," Great movie, don't waste money on the Disney dub.
","(0) for Disney dub Disney ruined the movie, seriously if your going to watch it, watch either the fox version or the Japanese. What stuns me is that Miyazaki did this movie, well that and the fact that Disney would RUIN a Miyazaki film. All of Miyazaki's films are good. Kiki's Delivery service for instance. all good. I absolutely love the movie, and when they get a little older my girls will get to enjoy it. The movie itself is pure magic, I love umbrella scene and the scene where the catbus first appears. I STILL have the VHS copy of the fox dub since I cant find the FOX version on DVD, although as soon as I find it I intend to buy the fox version DVD. In my opinion I wish that disny and the fanning girls would have left a wonderous movie alone. Disney has a way of ruining good stories. (Black Cauldron) cough* Cough."
"iamakitten","10","2","3","7 February 2010"," my favourite movie
","If you are sick of taking your children to see movies written by Disney where their intelligence will be insulted by stereotypical and unrealistic representations of children, consider showing them Totoro.<br/><br/>It is everything Disney is incapable of creating.. intelligent and heart warming with believable characters. Hayao Miyazaki doesn't need to rely on the same old cheap tricks to keep his movies interesting because he has something special.. he hasn't lost touch with the innocence and wonder of being a child, which is why he's so perfectly able to represent Mei and Satsuki's emotions and draw you into their world in this movie.<br/><br/>It isn't action packed or epic, but it doesn't need to be because it is far more special, individual and unique than any ""children's"" movie created in the last twenty years. This isn't a movie to be appreciate by children only, it is one of the rare movies that will be appreciated on different levels by viewers of all ages.<br/><br/>You must watch Totoro, and I would highly recommend watching it in subtitled format. The American voice actors do not demonstrate the ability of their Japanese counterparts and reduce the enjoyability of the movie greatly."

","My neighbour Totoro.<br/><br/>
Where do I begin. This movie is a cinematic masterpiece with amazing writing beautiful animation and tremendous sound and lighting.
Firstly the characters we start off with 2 young girls and there father moving to the country side. The character satsuki is the eldest daughter and is a fun smart young girl that brings a lot of charm and she definitely shows how natural growing up should be. She acts her age and plays with her sister and gets involved with chores and does act like a 10 year old should. Mei is the youngest at the age of 5 or 6 and she is a fire ball of energy and whimsy and often seeks adventure and is the spirit of what a child should act like and how children play the director really captures the true innocence of children and how children used to behave before technology took over. The father Tatsuo is a loving caring father who tries his best to give his family a good life. You can really see the lice he has for his children he acts like a typical dad and this is why I love ghibli movies so much they take strange concepts and turns them into normal life and the company chooses very human like characters and they understand true human emotion in ghibli films.
The plot.
So we start off in a moving van with the father and the 2 children and then we get settled with the surroundings the children explore the new house and this scene is definitely one of my favourites because is captured true child like play and exploring. They come across these black soot like creatures and later we find out they are called spot sprites and they are forest spirits. Meanwhile the father and neighbor granny sort out the house. At night time the father and 2 daughters share a bath now some people may find this weird but it was very common to share a bath with parents at that time and then we see the door sprites fly off into the distance. The story is a very loose one especially when I haven't even brought up the giant monster. I won't spoil it all but the main feature in this movie is a giant chinchilla like forest spirit makes Totoro. Him and a bus that is also a cat are the main spectacul of this movie and one day while Mei is exploring she comes across Totoro in the forest and in a normal movie the girl would scream and run away but not this movie she climes upon Totoro and sleeps on him. We find out that there mother is in hospital sick and there's the whole sub plot of when is she getting out of the hospital. What I love about this movie is the sense of innocence it really makes me feel like a 10 year old and the charm and scenery is delightful. The over arching lesson is family and growing up and how to deal with change and dissatisfaction is brilliant. The climax of the film is heart reaching and powerful and is an extremely sad and painful thing to watch but that's why it is so good it brings up so many emotions and Totoro is really an amusing character that isn't the main part of the film he isn't in it ally but that's what makes his character so special. I truly believe this is my favourite ghibli movie and one of the best films I've ever watched. However there are a few flaws such as the ending. The ending is annoying to watch because you want to see more, questions go unanswered such as is the mother going to live. Is Totoro real or imaginary but I guess these questions are supposed to be unanswered and remain a mystery. I would rate My Neighbour Totoro a 4.4/5"

I still wanted to hug that guy so badly just like I was when I was a kid. Other than that, I think the whole movie structured really really well. It never gets too over the top with the fantasies, and it knows exactly when to bring out the serious stuff and get emotional. It is all really well balanced. It also created really likeable characters as there are literally no evil characters throughout the film. Even though this movie sounds really childish, but I can tell you that's absolutely false.

"mstanger-99388","10","1","1","20 December 2018"," One of the Best Miyazaki Films
","Ever since my mom brought home the Chinese edition of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" way back in 2003, it's been on my top ten list of films. And while I haven't lived out in the East Asian countryside nor have I had my mother become seriously ill, the family dynamic of two young girls and their father can always take me back to being a little kid again.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes has to be when Mei goes missing. Satsuki and
Nanny are heard calling out for her over scenes of fields as the sun sets. First of all, beautiful scenery, but it always makes me nervous when Satsuki calls Mei's name out once more in hope only to be recieved by the loud, static buzz of cicadas. The barren and empty atmosphere certainly gives me the chills. It almost reminds me of getting lost when I was that age.<br/><br/>One of the best features of Miyazaki films is simply the pure piece of artwork it is, and it certainly doesn't falter here. Each animated figure is vividly colored, expressive, and detailed. It's almost a style where you could stop at any moment in the movie and take apart the details of Satsuki's facial expressions or the condition of Mei's clothes and figure out what is happening. Even better are the painted backgrounds of rice paddies that never cease to remind me of Van Gogh paintings or the spiritual forests, and creepy old houses. Every fine brushstroke adds more meaning and cultural significance to the plot, such as the protective spirit statues behind the bus stop in the woods just before Totoro shows up to wait for the Catbus.<br/><br/>Another great feature apparent in this film, and really of his films, is the shear originality of it. I'll be honest, I haven't seen a thing like it. The combination of East Asian mythology and Miyazaki's creativity make all his productions stand out from your typical animations. There's nothing quite so heart-warming as two little kids befriending the big and fuzzy spirit of the forest named Totoro. The plot and content is also innocent and folk-based unlike many animations. It's great in that it allows you to more closely see the values and morals of different cultures without all the hyped fuss. Truly a great movie for all people of all ages."

","When 4 year old Mei moves to a house in the country, in order to be closer to hospitalised Mum, with Dad and older sister Satsuki, she discovers Totoro in the vicinity - creatures like obese rabbits of various sizes.<br/><br/>This charming tale from Studio Ghibli is reminiscent of the British stories of Rupert Bear, where everday life rubs shoulders with high fantasy in a world where both are unremarkable. Couple this with an ability to see the world through a child's eyes, and an easy and undemanding narrative leads us through a series of events of extraordinary ordinariness. <br/><br/>It looks lovely, and leaves you with a smile on your face."

","Bland, boring, predictable animated pseudo fairytale of two Japanese girls and their father who move to the country to be nearer to their ailing mother's hospital.One day, they meet a forest spirit whom they call Totoro.Looking like an overweight rabbit with short prick erect ears, this non-threatening harmless character leads them through a series of bland, Disney like adventures that makes even ""Dora the Explorer"" look like Shakespeare's "" Mac Beth""-and we don't even get to see Totoro until a half hour into the movie! Thats about it. This is probably the most over rated film from Miyazaki, the uber over rated Japanese anime director.Its all done in a pastel tone animated style that looks like an a painting by a first grader, yet some of the backgrounds do have a certain charm to them.There is no edge, conflict, sense of menace or real emotion or drama in this pablum coated film to engage the audience. Even a 3 year old would become bored-fast. Done by Studio Ghibli-a sort of Japanese Disney studio, this turkey has earned much yen since its release. Not to mention the merchandising it has inspired that, fortunately is not too readily available in the United States. And can anybody please tell me what is so great about Miyazaki? He's just another ""in it for the money"" artist like Tim Burton, Spielberg, and Murakami. As a matter of fact, I have a hard time distinguishing Miyazaki from Murakami.. Even Spielberg's ""ET"", a film that I thoroughly hated seems enjoyable and well made when compared to this. Do yourself a favor-watch it only if you have to. Not worth your precious time.For some reason, this was one of the the highest grossing film of all time in Japan until Titanic came along. I can't see why."

","Tonari no Totoro is a marvelous movie. We can learn a lot about relationships between human life and nature from this movie. Totoro is a forest spirit. When Mei tries to go to hospital that her mother was in, She gets lost. Satsuki is worried about Mei. Totoro kindly helps them. The scene in which the forest spirit helps humans is superb. Totoro also presents a gift to Satsuki and Mei to thank her for her fatherfs umbrella. It was a package wrapped up in bamboo leaves and tied with dragon whiskers. The substance is magic nuts and seeds. I would like to be given the some gift from Totoro. I watch Disney's Lilo and Stitch too. Tonari no Totoro and Lilo and Stitch films are different though they are both family animation. Lilo and Stitch is a more realistic film than Totoro. Stitch is an alien who causes many trouble at every place. And Lilo isn't childlike as Mai. Both at these films are interesting. But, I like Tonari no Totoro better than Lilo and Stitch. Because Tonari no Totoro gives us a lot of dream. For example, a Cat bus which Totoro carry Mei and Satsuki is really impressive. After seeing this movie, I realize we should protect nature in which Totoro can have a happy life. I rated this movie at 9/10."
"tjsdomer2","5","6","16","28 July 2016"," I like Totoro, but...
","I can't say enough of the animation, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Despite this, I'm not sure what message the film sends, besides being a child-like distraction. Maybe that's the point, and I guess that's OK for kids, but nothing really stands out in a cohesive way for adults. Another possible message involves the tension between childish innocence (as represented by Totoro?) and the worries of growing into adulthood, though I'm not entirely sure what that message is other than being true prima facie.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is too ambiguous in the conflict department, and as a result is lacking in immersion for the viewer. Even children's films deserve better than this. Though also a flawed and somewhat rambling film, I prefer Spirited Away.<br/><br/>My Neighbor Totoro gets 2 out of 4 stars."

I didn't enjoy anything about it. <br/><br/>On the plus side the kids I watch love it and will sit though the whole movie.

","This was a wonderful movie in how imaginative it was. I would completely recomend it for family viewing and if i ever have any children i am sure it will be one of thier favorites.<br/><br/>My complaints are that, while being very imaginative, the movie was rather empty when it came to plot when it came to depth and meaning. Some rather important points were not even mentioned, such as why the girls' Mother was in the hospital, and what exactly a totoro is. Also, there really was no set plot, it was more of a story that left me feeling relativly empty when the film ended. I felt it needed to be longer (which would take away from the appeal to children), or have a sequal, which i dont see any reason for it not to.<br/><br/>I did enjoy a film on a certain level, but would not recomend it to an adult unless they were a fan of animation or Miyazaki's work. If you have any children on the other hand, i couldn't recomend it enough. My only remaining hope is that Disney releases the rest of Miyazaki's work, especially Nausicaa, which i cannot recomend enough if you can find a copy with subtitles."

Lots of times where the silence or lack of music or dialogue lets the visuals speak for themselves. I usually prefer the soundtrack in the original language, but these voice actors were just perfect for the parts. The girls' boundless energy was infectious.<br/><br/>This is not just a movie for young kids, although they will probably find it quite enjoyable. Adults can appreciate the youthful exuberance exhibited by the girls. There were lots of little touches that made it seem ""real"".

","Totoro is one of our family's favorite movies of all time. We watch it again and again, so much that there is a chip in the middle of the disc. So when I saw the title at Costco or someplace I grabbed it to have a second copy. My kids just watched it today and they were sorely disappointed to see that Disney had wrecked their favorite movie. For whatever reason, they took it upon themselves to ""improve"" or update the film. They changed many of the voices and also changed some names and also the dialogue, all in bad ways. Did they not learn anything from the reaction to The Last Airbender? The result is a darker and less pleasing version than the original. So by all means get this movie but try to find the non-2005 version as originally dubbed into English under the direction of the boys in Japan rather than the cultural destroyers from Anaheim/Florida."
"Bob Pr.","10","2","4","11 January 2011"," Delightful ""slice of life"" film
","Miyazaki's animé films differ considerably from the usual (Disney) animated films both in art form and narrative: <br/><br/>-- The art work in many animated films is similar to that in Mickey Mouse cartoons: outlines or features that are colored/shaded in; some movements are exaggerated for dramatic effect; almost all stories have adversaries or problems that the hero/heroine defeats near the conclusion. <br/><br/>-- In Miyazaki's animé films, the backgrounds (landscapes, skies, interiors of homes, etc.)are beautifully, naturally rendered: e.g., weathered planks of wood have the texture and color of the real thing; clouds look very realistic. But while the actions, reactions, emotions and movements of people are very realistic, the visual, artistic rendering of people (& animals & fantasy creatures) is more cartoonish; the animals and fantasy creatures frequently move in ways not possible for people. But, while these human figures are cartoon-like, their reactions, emotions, motives, etc., are VERY realistic. Many of Miyazaki's films have a ""slice of life"" quality--there's no big conflict and climax of resolution; his films show life.<br/><br/>Also, Miyazaki's films often mix objects (cars, phones, radios) from different time frames and some of that occurs here with telephones from the '30s, and a radio and 3 wheeled motorcycle van from the '40s. This video clip shows some of this quality: http://w w w.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi477103897/ (copy link & remove spaces between w w w to activate.)<br/><br/>In ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" the two principle characters are sisters: Mei, 4 years old, who is sometimes too spunky and daring and her older sister, Satseki, about 8-10 years old, who cares for Mei when she's home from school. The movie opens with the 2 girls and their father moving to a home in the country which will permit them to be closer to the girls' mother who is recuperating in a hospital.<br/><br/>The old house they move into is said to be haunted (the sisters DO see some soot sprites). In a nearby forest, they find a large, somewhat pear-shaped, friendly magical forest creature they name Totoro and two much smaller similar creatures.<br/><br/>The movie deals with their adventures in their new home, with Satseki's school, with adventures while waiting for their mother to recover, etc.<br/><br/>Lovely to watch. The capturing of the girls' interactions between themselves and with others is remarkably well observed and captured."

It is very simple in story and character but it is all very beautiful, charming and touching. The animation is typical Ghibli, ethereal-looking and just ravishing to watch, while the music is one of my favourite scores in a Ghibli film. The story is simple, but I loved the simplicity, it had such a pleasant atmosphere to it, and the characters are engaging with great chemistry together.

","This was both of my children's favorite movie as kids! So I thought I would surprise my 20 year old with the new Disney version for his birthday. Big mistake! They re-did everything. They performed the notorious Disney cutting of the film they're famous for when given foreign animated films. Eliminating scenes all throughout the movie, or just cutting scenes shorter. All the voices were redone horribly. The two young girls who were tasked to re-perform the voices of the two main characters sucked. Every change was pointless and brought the movie down. The original American version of the film done by Fox, I would rate it a 10/10 as a movie your children can enjoy and love. The new ""remastered"" Disney special edition I would give a 5/10.

"Rectangular_businessman","10","2","4","12 June 2010"," A masterpiece for all the ages
","Miyazaki has to be one of the greatest and most creative artists and film-makers alive. Creating some of the most well crafted and unique animated features of recent years, Miyazaki makes his film very personally, checking thousands and thousands of the frames himself. To top it off most of his films are made with either very minimal use of or no use of computer animation. While I believe CG animated features are an art and respectable side-genre of animated films, there is something always refreshing about seeing hand-drawn images, especially ones as vibrant and creative as Miyazaki's. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is one of Miyazaki's earliest films as director and what he crafts here is a magical film that proves that plot is not everything. The premise of ""Totoro"" is not bad or stupid, but not the strong point of the film. However, it serves it's purpose, and Miyazaki uses his simplistic plot line to help contribute to the aura he gives his film. As with any Studio Ghibli film the visuals are astounding. The creature designs of the Totoro, his small friends, the elaborate cat bus, and even the human characters is pure magic. One thing that I absolutely love about ""My Neighbor Totoro"", which is really a very minor feature of the film, but an important one. When the young daughter tells her father that she has seen the mystical creature, Totoro, the father does not scoff at her 'fantasy' or tell her that there is no such thing as a Totoro, but instead goes along with her. It's such a breath of fresh air to see a father figure especially in a children's fantasy film believing the wild accusations of his young daughter. It's true that ""Totoro"" doesn't real involve any main conflict, but that is the beauty of it. Towards the end there is a bit of a dilemma, but not to the point where it turns into the typical structure of most kid's flicks. ""Totoro"" relies on enchanting visuals, insightful character writing and charm. So many movies are dark and depressing and while I fully stand behind depressing movies it's nice to see a movie that makes you feel good. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" not only makes you feel good, but it also leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling. If you're a parent I highly suggest you show this film to your children for two reasons. 1) I know that they'll love and 2) it's a movie for little kids that you will thoroughly enjoy as an adult as well."

","My Neighbour Totoro is one of the most enchanting films that I've seen.

When the girls explore the house they find strange creatures that look like tiny black fur balls which scurry away as soon as anybody enter the room. While Satsuki is at school Mei sees a strange little creature, about the size of a rabbit, in the garden and chases it into the forest, here she finds a similar creature which is much larger. She names them ""Totoro"", which I believe is a slight mispronunciation of the Japanese word for a troll.<br/><br/>When here father and Satsuki find her sleeping in the woods we are left unsure whether it was real or whether Mei had dreamt it. Not long after while waiting at the bus stop in the rain Satsuki also sees Totoro as he is waiting for his bus... not just any bus though, he rides in the Cat-bus, a wonderful eight legged creature who's eyes are its headlights.<br/><br/>This film is suitable for people of all ages, there is no antagonist and the only slight worries are when Mei gets lots while trying to walk to see her mother who is in hospital.<br/><br/>This comment was based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles, I've only seen a little bit of it in English but what I saw gave me no cause for complaint."

It is worth noting that the little boy in the film was shy when facing the girl, teased the girl, and finally let go to find his sister together. These processes show the maturity of a little boy. When I saw it, I felt: Isn't this me?"

","""My Neighbor Totoro"" is one of Studio Ghibli's most pure, heartwarming films, a feel good movie in its essence. The two sisters Satsuki and Mei move to the Japanese countryside with their father, where they befriend the large, loving wood spirit Totoro. As always with Studio Ghibli, the animation is flawless, with the fantasy forest setting being a cavalcade of cozy, leafy dream landscapes. Totoro and his friends are simply drawn, but just perfectly so, and the cat bus (or whatever it is called) is a highlight, being a psychedelic scene stealer whenever he emerges out of the bushes. The plot of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" doesn't use any surprising twists to reach its end and moral. Instead, Hayao Miyazaki brings a story of innocence, sister love, and childish curiosity in the cleanest, no-fuzz way possible. From start to finish, you will find yourself 100% consumed by the film and your inner child are about to come out as the lovely sisters are so relatable. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" wouldn't suffer from showcasing its wood critter, and now cult icon, star a bit more often. Neither would I complain if we got to see a bit more of the fantasy forest he calls his home. And while children might not be as caught up with the realistic pacing - I refuse to call it slow - as the rest of us, even the most cold hearted people must relate to this brilliant take in childhood adventures. At least I want to think so."

","The rating I gave might seem excessive for this movie. It's an animated fantasy. It has subtitles (has to be watched thus way IMO). However, the way this movie makes me feel is deserved of being a perfect 10.
Firstly, the characters are a delight. The girls are loud and annoying but at the same time so cute you love them. Totoro and every other fantasy being are wonderful and creative. The story itself, minus the fantasy element, is almost inconsequential but is enough to keep you engaged. The animation is incredible. Every scene a piece of art itself.

","My Neighbour Totoro, celebrating silver jubilee of its original release this year, is an animated classic directed Hayao Miyazaki. Popularly considered that the best Japanese animated film, it has found global acclaim over the years and remains one of the best animated family entertainers ever made.<br/><br/>The story begins with Tatsuo Kusakabe, a university Professor shifting into a rickety rural house with his two daughters - Satsuki & Mei - such that they could stay close to the nursing home where their mother is recovering from an illness. Upon settling into their new home, Mei & Satsuki notice some strange happenings, but are not too perturbed and merely approach them with an innocent curiosity of a child. One fine day, little Mei while playing near the home, comes upon an oversized bunny like creature under a giant camphor tree. She finds the cuddly creature to be a friendly spirit refers to it as Totoro. Eventually, Satsuki also meets the creature after her initial skepticism in what turns out to be a wonderful scene when she waits with an umbrella for her dad to return home from work on a rainy night at a bus stop. The rest of the story follows the encounters between Totoro and the two girls set against the imminent arrival of their mother from the nursing home after her treatment.<br/><br/>For most of us who have grown upon a staple of modern digital animated movies churned out by famous Hollywood studios like Pixar or Disney, this is a welcome throwback to those wonderful years of our childhood when we used to be enthralled by animated movies/series such as the Jungle Book, Spiderman, He-Man, etc. Made in the classic style, the colourful creatures and the lush landscapes which are brought to life with great detail and richness in each frame of this movie are an ode to the tireless efforts of the animators who have hand-drawn each frame with oodles of vivid imagination and great passion.<br/><br/>This movie treads a path that is markedly different from the several norms of the contemporary animated movies from Hollywood which rarely explore outside a set three act mould of story-telling. There are no superheroes, no fearsome creatures, no bad characters, no life-altering choices or challenges and definitely, no underdog aspiring to ace the masters. This movie, despite having creatures/spirits based on fantasy, portrays a natural flow of life which is close to reality that is unadulterated by the compulsions of creating any onscreen drama.<br/><br/>Miyazaki keeps the story line childishly simple and does not bother a great deal on the construction of a plot. Nevertheless, he fleshes out his characters with enough personality to engage the viewer - be it a father who is sensitive, patient, tactful and sensible; or the daughters who are caring, understanding, helpful and responsible; or the mother who is warm and confident despite her ailment. Even the minor characters like the granny and her grandson make an impact on the viewer.<br/><br/>The genius of Miyazaki is in the way he seamlessly synthesises the realms of reality with magical charm to present a movie that transports us back to an idyllic world of a joyful childhood filled with innocence, fantasy, mirth and fearless fascination for the unknown. That, in no small measure, explains the overwhelming global success of My Neighbour Totoro which remains an enduring and endearing classic for the whole family to cherish even after two decades of its original release."

That's not the only encounter with reality in the movie, but let me tell you, it's not just material changes, but some serious events handled in such a respectful way without being as heavy handed as the tear-jerkingly sad Grave of the Fireflies released that same year.<br/><br/>And as always the animation is just gorgeous with beautiful design of iconic characters, immersive landscapes and grabbing elements of imaginative beings which can be in every child's mind at that young age.<br/><br/>A nice feel-good movie with a surprisingly real setting.

","When first seeing this movie, I didn't understand why this movie didn't have a major plot and conflict. With all these fantasy creatures including Totoro (One of my favorite anime characters) and the cat bus, I was shocked to find this film was a simple slice of life story with the fantasy creatures living in this world as it was natural. The two leading female characters are getting used to life in a new home, growing up, and their mom in a hospital. They soon meet Totoro and multiple other creatures and they settle with them in their lives. I found this kind of story odd and weird at first. But now, the more and more I watch it, this kind of story is something I need. Other Studio Ghibli movies are these big action-packed fantasy adventure movies, so it's nice to see something cute and simple. This film does have a plot though but it doesn't have a clear focus or core, it has multiple focuses such as the creatures, the mom, a boy who has a crush on one of the girls, and getting use to living in a new neighborhood. This film makes me feel like a child when seeing all of the great imagery, like able characters, and cute creatures. Besides Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. This would be my favorite Studio Ghibli film. It's colorful, fun, heartwarming, and realistic while taking place in a world of creatures. I'd recommend it."
"trenttuttl","10","0","0","22 July 2019"," A little film.
","And there's nothing wrong with that. After directing two epics in a row, Miyazaki went smaller for his fourth feature. I really respect that he scaled back his work for a time, letting some more ""out-there"" ideas be produced, before returning to creating epics in 1997.<br/><br/>A word of caution though. Don't go into this expecting too much to happen plot-wise. Not saying that you should have low expectations, or anything, but I could understand if the story of two young sisters, and their forest spirit-thing, doesn't hold your attention at first. Instead of looking for action, try to focus on the relationships and chemistry of all the characters. And also, just have fun! Let go! Let the film uplift you!<br/><br/>Oh, and I mean it when I say it's uplifting. Every time it gets to the part where Satsuki finds her little sister, and they go to secretly visit their mother, I'm always grinning from ear to ear, (Like Totoro)! A nice, light Miyazaki film."

It's childlike and surreal at times it makes you think of children stories are fairy tales, if that's juxtaposed with very real emotions and feeling and a sense of honesty of life. It somehow the film stays light-hearted and whimsical. The animation is absolutely gorgeous but in a sublime if not subdued kind of way. The story and the depth of the plot might be somewhat lacking in that they aren't complex, but the connection to the characters and their humanity give so many relatable threads throughout that you might almost overlook that.<br/><br/>I come away from this film, not feeling wowed and the way that I did with princess mononoke, but feeling like I've somehow been shown something that captures an essential character of childhood and innocence without watering down the emotional reality surrounding all that whimsy"

"elicopperman","8","0","0","10 November 2018"," Everyone's Favorite Ghibli Creature
","We all love My Neighbor Totoro, and there's many reasons why. It's an adorable children's film with a lot of heart and soul, it's the first film people conjure up when they think of Studio Ghibli, and it's one of the most recognizable Japanese animated films of all time. Out of all the films by Hayao Miyazaki, this one just might be his most popular, even more than his greatest accomplishments like that of Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. I mean, Totoro is Ghibli's mascot after all. But what does make this film special and worth this much praise for over 30 years?<br/><br/>When one gets down to it, this film doesn't really have much of a concrete narrative. The whole film centers around two girls named Satsuki and Mei who move with their father to the countryside to be close to their ill mother, and the rest of the feature is about them embracing the wonders of the forest around them, as well as befriending a giant bunny only they can see. Now from that concept alone, this film could have easily failed, as there's no full on narrative to gravitate towards and we mainly watch the children run around in their home, go to school and hang out with Totoro. However, in execution, it actually works as a visual showcase of childhood wonderment.<br/><br/>Apparently, Miyazaki based this film off his own life growing up in post WWI Japan around the ever growing urban development near big cities. Similar to Satsuki and Mei's mother, Miyazaki's mother suffered from tuberculosis, so the depictions of the children's astonishment and activities around their country house feel very much like how any given child would act. In addition, the dynamic between Satsuki and Mei feels very genuine, as even during their biggest arguments, they're no less different than any sibling rivalry that we've all faced growing up. For a film entitled My Neighbor Totoro, the film really is about these two girls' mundane lives, and there's a lot to appreciate about just how peaceful yet alluring their fantasies play out in contrast to their daily lives.<br/><br/>That being said, the closest element of the film that resembles a plot is during the third act when Mei runs away to the hospital after hearing that the mother has to stay a little longer. A real sense off drama comes through and yet despite it feeling very emotional, we all know things will be just fine with Totoro around. In fact, this act alone pretty much wrapped up the arch of the girls worrying about their mother, and one can tell Miyazaki really felt proud about this addition given his autobiographical influence that led to this conclusion.<br/><br/>There are many different mythological beasts of Japanese folklore, and I think Miyazaki has created a new one for the ages. One of the best scenes in the whole film is centered around our two protagonists waiting for their dad at the bus stop while Totoro waits for a cat bus. Setting aside just how luxurious that cat bus is by both design and motion, there's a real sense of fantastical mystery that comes from seeing such a strange albeit friendly creature that children can gravitate to in becoming one with their surroundings. Overall, My Neighbor Totoro is a genuinely sweet, optimistic and downright admirable family film that reminds us how friendliness can triumph over grimness."

","I had seen the image of one of the recognisable title creature from this Japanese anime movie several times, and I am obviously a big fan of the animations from Studio Ghibli, so I could not wait to watch it, directed by Hayao Miyazaki (The Castle of Cagliostro, Spirited Away, Ponyo). Basically set in 1958 Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe (Tim Daly) and his two daughters, Satsuki (Dakota Fanning) and Mei (Elle Fanning), have moved into an old house to be closer to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko (Lea Salonga), is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited with by tiny creatures, small, dark, dust-like house spirits called susuwatari, until the girls and their father settle into the house, the soot spirits drift away on the wind to find another empty house. One day, Mei sees two white, rabbit-like ears in the grass, they are two spirits, they lead her through a briar patch and into the hollow of a large camphor tree. She meets and befriends a larger version of the same kind of spirit (Frank Welker), it identifies itself with a series of roars, which Mei interprets as ""Totoro"", she falls asleep atop the large creature. When Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground in a dense briar clearing, despite her attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her, telling her she must have encountered the ""keeper of the forest"", and that Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to. On a rainy night, the girls become worried when a bus they are expecting carrying Tatsuo does not arrive, Mei falls asleep, and Satsuki is able to see Totoro when he appears beside them, he is delighted to be offered an umbrella to shade him from the rain. In return, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds, then a giant bus-shaped cat appears, halting at the stop, Totoro boards it, taking the umbrella, they disappear, shortly after Tatsuo's bus arrives. The girls plant the seeds, a few days later Totoro and his miniature colleagues appears and engage in a ceremonial dance, when the girls join in, the seeds sprout, growing and combining into an enormous tree, then Totoro, his colleagues and the girls go for a ride on a magical flying top. In the morning, the tree is gone, but the seeds have indeed sprouted, it is unclear if they girls were dreaming or not. The girls find out that a planned visit to Yasuko has been postponed due to a setback in her treatment, Satsuki is disappointed and worried, while Mei is upset and angry, leading to an argument between the sisters. Mei disappears, prompting Satsuki and the neighbours to search for her, Mei is trying to walk the long distance to the hospital to bring her mother some fresh corn. In desperation, Satsuki returns to the camphor tree and pleads with Totoro to help her, he is delighted to assist, and summons the Catbus, which carries her to where Mei has stopped. Having rescued Mei, the Catbus then whisks her and Satsuki over the countryside to see Yasuko in the hospital, they perch in a tree outside, to overhear the conversation between their parents. They hear that their mother has a minor, but is otherwise fine, they secretly leave some corn on the windowsill, and return home in the Catbus. Eventually, Mei and Satsuki's mother returns home, the sisters play with each other, while Totoro and his friends watch the family from afar. Also starring The Little Mermaid's Pat Carroll as Granny, Paul Butcher as Kanta and The Simpsons' Russi Taylor as Additional Voices. This film has developed a cult following over the years, it is interesting insight into childhood innocence and experiences, it is a bit of minimal storyline, but you can enjoy the adventurous moments, furry Totoro is adorable, the 12-legged cat bus is wonderfully bizarre, and the colourful animation is of course delightful viewing, a worthwhile animated fantasy.

"Anonymous002","8","0","0","22 July 2018"," Too much for a kid's film
","This film is not only for kids . Infact , I don't recommend it to anyone below 13 . Most of the cartoons movies have a simple single plot. This one has two major plots and some sub plots too. I think it's a little complex for a children film.There is a scene where a father and his two daughters bath together which not okay for such a film. Maybe it's a culture in Japan but it can be disturbing for foreign viewers. Furthermore, there is a subplot of a love story between two kids. I admit that cartoons(And Animes) are also for adults but still this is a little too much for animation film.This is case with other Miyazaki films .<br/><br/>Coming to the story , it starts with tatsuo kusakabe buying an old house . He lives with his daughters satsuki and Mei while his wife is sick and is in a hospital. Satsuki and Mei discovers that the house is haunted . They soon meet forest spirits and befriends them . First 50 minutes are wonderfully entertaining . It's a highly imaginative film. The bizarreness of the storyline keeps us engaged for entire 50 minutes. But after that the story goes downhill . It becomes confusing . The repetitive incidents fails to entertain . It drags for another thirty minutes.<br/><br/>It does not have much of a storyline . It's a combination of sub-plots with a high amount of imagination which is best suited for kids . Miyazaki has a wide understanding about children's mind . More than any of us.

","Tonari no Totoro is an animated film which tells the story of Satsuki, Mei and their father Tatsuo who just moved into a new place, a little house in the Japanese countryside, so that the girls are closer to their mother's hospital. The little house is surrounded by fields and forest. In the nearest forest, Mei and Satsuki are going to create strong ties with the forest spirits called Totoro. The forest spirit is really powerful in the way that, in a certain angle, he can represent the hope of the two young girls toward their mother's health and the wish that it gets better. What is interesting in this movie, is that it is different from the classic outline when the lead character has to fight/ win over an enemy which is another character. There is no enemy in this story, the main problem that hooks viewers is the disease. In this way Tonari no Totoro is different from most of animated movies putting forward the enemy and his/her fall as a goal. Moreover, the magical atmosphere of the movie, halfway between the real and the imaginary, plunges the viewers in a particular mood and way of thinking and incents them to feel more concerned about the problem while still not being too worried. Indeed, the movie is far from being a tragedy and the magical atmosphere debunks the stress of the disease in a way. From its deep content to the way it is structure, Tonari no Totoro is a really beautiful movie that I would definitely recommend watching!"
"AhmedSpielberg99","8","0","0","5 June 2018"," I felt like I was watching my younger self!
","I can't describe how delighted am I after I've just finished watching this movie. This is the best movie that captured the childhood very accurately. The children characters behave so realistically that I couldn't believe my eyes while watching them play, cry, laugh, or doing anything. I didn't felt like I was watching a child in front of me, but I felt like I was watching my younger self; I felt like I was watching myself as a child, or as if my childhood memories were being displayed before me. Even if I haven't done that particular thing the characters do, I somehow felt that my younger self would do the exact thing. If that means anything, it's that Hayao Miyazaki has captured The essence of childhood like now one did.<br/><br/>But the greatest thing about My Neighbor Totoro isn't how realistic it feels, but it's the fabulous message it delivers, and the thing that is more fascinating is the way it delivers this message. I really shouldn't spoil anything about this gorgeous film, but it delivers a message about facing the fear; the fear of everything, and the fear in all its kinds and levels. Miyazaki merged this message with the story in a gleefully brilliant way.<br/><br/>I shouldn't call it delivering the message, though. Instead, I should call it merging or combining the message with the story, or rather I should say that Miyazaki created an entire story from a message! It's really amazing that this film has no real plot!<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki proved that it's not even necessary for a movie to have an antagonist, or at least not a common one, as I mentioned above, the story itself is about a message about facing the fear. And I didn't feel at any time throughout the movie that I need an antagonist or a usual problem to be invested in the movie. I was engaged and hooked from the very beginning of the movie till the end credits scene, which is very cool, by the way.<br/><br/>The thing is that at the third act the movie changed completely in terms of the plot; it turned from a plot-free movie to a movie that has a real plot and a very serious problem. The plot and its problem didn't come from nowhere; they are attached very well to the story from its beginning, and it's been appeared later that the plot is kinda share the same message of the story, but the problem is that the movie changed a great deal when it moved from its second to the third act. I felt as the movie betrayed itself after promising, and spectacularly managing to keep the audience on the edge of their seat with a story devoid from typical plot issues and obstacles. Yes, I've been engaged again and invested in the story with its plot because I cared about every single character, but it took me a little time, and I really felt a bit uncomfortable and annoyed with this inconsistency.<br/><br/>Overall, I can say that My Neighbor Totoro is an imaginative tale that every parent should enjoy it with his/her child. Because I think that the moral of the story is actually as, if not more important to parents.<br/><br/>I personally prefer My Neighbor Totoro to Spirited Away, but if I'm going to be honest with myself, Spirited Away is the better film; just slightly better. Looking forward to see more works from this genius filmmaker.<br/><br/>(8.5/10)"

","It is a dream, and it is not a dream. Two girls, Satsuki and younger sister Mei, move with their father to a country home to be closer to their sick mother. The girls discover a magical realm full of playful, mischievous and child-like spirits. When their mother appears to be in deeper trouble, Satsuki and Mei set off on their own to see what they can do to help.<br/><br/>Prepare for deep immersion in Japanese culture, together with its surreal magic, humor and charm! Combine this with the vivid imagination, wit, playfulness and vibrant artistic detail of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and discover a film experience that will transport you to a parallel universe of fantastic sounds, colors and emotions. Enter mysterious forest shrines, dance in the moonlight, listen to the eerie chirp of cicadas and distinct calls from Japanese kites (hawks). See the camphor trees in all their shades, admire the wildflowers and the sky full of stars, and enjoy frequent baths and magical spells. The artistic detail of the animation is amazing to behold, even as early as thirty years ago; light and shadows in multiple layers and forms, reflections and glare in glass, translucent water, drifting clouds, the glow of twilight, astonishing sunrises and sunsets, complex angles of the sunlight, rainfall that mimics the real thing in sight and sound, a rich diversity of dragonflies and butterflies, and even multiple shades to the paint on the wall.<br/><br/>Contrary to European culture, a haunted house (a sub-theme of the film) is not necessarily a bad or scary thing. Japanese spirits and demons are good or bad, or more often both, depending on the circumstances. Please listen to the film in Japanese, as the fastidious Miyazaki takes great care to choose the perfect voices. Plus it is rewarding to learn some Japanese (konichiwa! moshi, moshi!) The filmmakers must have spent time observing kids to know and reveal their antics so well. Released by Studio Ghibli at the same time as Grave of Fireflies."

","Even after 25 years, My Neighbor Totoro remains an instantly watchable animated masterpiece that holds new surprises from every time I watch it.<br/><br/>Satsuki and Mei are sisters who move to the Japanese countryside with their father. The children are fascinated with the quirks of their new house, as well as the vast nature around it. Satsuki goes to school and Mei begins to explore a fantastical world beneath a large tree in the backyard. She meets three little creatures and names one of them Totoro. Mei tells her sister about the adventure, but Satsuki does not believe her. During the next few days, the sisters discover more and more about their neighborhood and adjust to their new way of life.<br/><br/>My Neighbor Totoro effortlessly crafts and develops so many different poignant stories. It is a coming-of-age tale, as well as a story about how we deal with change and one about the bond between two siblings. Totoro, his little pals, and the world they inhabit add a whole other layer to an already complete narrative. The magical elements intertwine with Satsuki and Mei's story. They bring light to the siblings, during a scary and dark time in their life. The elements of magic add some levity to less joyful parts of the film, giving just as much closure to the audience as to the characters.<br/><br/>The film never reveals too much about Totoro and a lot about him remains a mystery even after the credits roll. He is so adorably drawn and never feels threatening. He has no dialogue, excluding a few grunts here and there, but is still one of my favorite things about this film. He brings a kind of magic that resonates with you every time he is on screen.<br/><br/>The lesson of My Neighbor Totoro is to never lose faith in what you believe in. Mei's belief in the magic of Totoro never falters and for that, Totoro helps her and Satsuki not just because they are kind souls, but also because they both learn to believe in his magic.<br/><br/>I give My Neighbor Totoro an age rating of 4 to 18. It appeals to all ages and has practically nothing objectionable for young audiences. I think adults will marvel at the spellbinding animation and wonderful story. I give My Neighbor Totoro 5 out of 5 stars and you need to see this special re-release if you haven't already fallen in love with this film.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

","The anime movie My Neighbor Totoro is cute and funny, yet somehow still realistic. Even though some parts are sad, that adds to the plot and makes the story even better. It starts with two sisters, 4-year-old Mei and 12-year-old Satsuki. When Mei runs off and meets a large, mischievous forest spirit named Totoro, their lives are changed forever. <br/><br/>My Neighbor Totoro is directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Every scene is hand-drawn, unlike modern CGI movies. The rural setting and characters just feel real. In one scene, Mei trips and falls instead of running on. This gives a sense of reality, instead of edited perfection.<br/><br/>The story starts when Mei, Satsuki and their father move to a new house while their mother is in the hospital. They soon discover that their house is inhabited by forest spirits, such as the soot gremlins. Nearby, Totoro lives in a huge camphor tree and a magical, eight-legged cat bus is a normal mode of transportation for them. <br/><br/>After Satsuki and Mei get into an argument, Mei runs away. This part is so heartbreaking! With the help of Totoro...you'll see. The ending is a surprise you'll enjoy!<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki has also directed other enjoyable anime movies, such as Kiki's Delivery Service and Spirited Away. Recently, Hayao Miyazaki came out of retirement. I, for one, cannot wait to see another Miyazaki directed film!
My Neighbor Totoro is cute, funny and realistic. However, I feel that something is missing. Totoro sounds like the main character, but he is on the screen for only a few scenes. Therefore, the movie somehow seems incomplete. The fact that I want more from it only proves how captivating it is.<br/><br/>Overall, My Neighbor Totoro is an amazing movie. In 1988, when this movie came out, anime was not that popular. My Neighbor Totoro set off a craze for anime in the U.S. that has not stopped yet. The special features unravel the magic by describing how the characters were created, the real life inspiration for the movie's unique locations and more.<br/><br/>I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 8 to 12.

"datautisticgamer-74853","9","0","0","26 December 2017"," Yet another Miyazaki champion
","The Music Box Theater not too far away from my house was playing this movie as part of a week long celebration of Studio Ghibli. Being the opportunistic animation watcher that I am, I decided to make today a suitable view for this film, which was on my watchlist. So, what be my thoughts?<br/><br/>The animation, as with anything spawned from Studio Ghibli, can only be described with rather bombastically high quality language. While the humans look familiar in style to other Ghibli films (not that it's a fault), Totoro and the other spirits have a design that I really enjoy. It's no wonder that Totoro ended up becoming the Studio Ghibli mascot. The environments are lush, which is a pretty major compliment to pay an animated film from 1988 given how Oliver and Company had really only one OK setting. The story is captivating, although there are some points in the script that I will say weren't done too well in the 2005 dubbing (Mei's cries don't sound like actual 4-year-old cries). The humor, however, blasts full force from both the script and animation, including the infamous Totoro jump scene. I was laughing a lot of the time and a smile remained on my face when the movie ended. As we go for music, it's surprisingly memorable for a movie that isn't a musical; I swear that I could get the main background theme stuck in my head if I watch this one more time. And for characters, I appreciated how Satsuki kept by Mei's side even when their relationship roughened based on their mother, which was a very great message. Most people would probably find Totoro cute (since his merchandise is EVERYWHERE), but I find him more hilarious and fascinating than actually adorable. I don't have much to say for the side characters except that they, like in previous Studio Ghibli movies, succeed in what the script has provided for them.<br/><br/>Like almost every film Studio Ghibli has produced, this is a film that I can recommend to any family, otaku, or just the common audience. Just keep the volume down when you watch it, though; some parts of the film nearly slit my eardrums. Children may find Totoro somewhat scary at times, let alone too loud. Regardless, this is a premier family film, and no family deserves to miss it."

"ElMaruecan82","9","0","0","22 December 2017"," No one understands the soul of childhood like Hayao Miyazaki...
","Miyazaki's movies demand more viewings, not because they're too complex, but because their narratives and visuals are so rich you can easily miss a detail. 
Still, ""Totoro"" looked startlingly simple and straight-forward, there wasn't much intrigue, or even character-development, it's not even a coming-of-age story, despite being a childhood adventure and while there's no villain, there's no conflict whatsoever to enhance the dramatic outlook.<br/><br/>But it's precisely for these reasons that I watched it again, and this time, I had the proper key to open my heart and let the magic operate: my daughter who's the same age as Mei, four years (actually she just celebrated it today). We saw the cartoon together and I didn't miss any detail, I couldn't since each scene she asked me question, about the soot sprites, the haunted house, why are they laughing in the bath, why are their little dark things leaving the house? And I had to pay attention to all these tiny details because she wouldn't miss one, just like Mei... and then I realized that Miyazaki understood children.<br/><br/>I said this is a children movie; less because it deals with children but because it's oriented toward children. And maybe it's because Mei is the smallest one that she could spot these rabbit-like ears in the grass and then discover a white little creature with the same role than the white rabbit in ""Alice in Wonderland"". But Miyazaki doesn't use that scene for a narrative purpose, if he cared for narrative, the titular Totoro would have appeared fifteen minutes earlier. Miyazaki sets the mood, he lets us contemplate the place, the house and the beautiful nature with that watercolor quality so typical of the anime style.<br/><br/>As usual there are many long moments where nothing happens, or nothing special, which is the antithesis of screen writing but the essence of life, sometimes, things take time to happen. And we have almost thirty seconds where Mei is trying to catch the little rabbit and we see nothing else, except for a butterfly entering from the other side of a cabin and getting out from the hole Mei is staring at. I hadn't noticed that butterfly before and it didn't change much to my comprehension of the film but its adorable randomness made me smile. Never underestimate the appeal of 'insignificant' details.<br/><br/>Finally, Mei spots the rabbit and he's following a bigger one, the two run away leaving nuts and seeds on the ground and after a chase across the forest, she finally lands near the hollow of a camphor tree where Totoro is sleeping. What a delightfully anticlimactic entrance! Myazaki's most iconic creation just lying there and being slightly disturbed by a small girl. We're not even sure his name is Totoro, it seems to be the way she interpreted his repeated roars... or yawns. Mei baptizes him Totoro and seems to be the only privileged kid to see her, for a while.<br/><br/>But here again, Miyazaki avoids all the clichÃ©s of the genre, Mei's father believes her and explains that the creature is probably the master of the forest or some protective spirit. And her sister Satsuki while the voice of wisdom at the age of 10 and the substitute mother... envies her kid sister. Miyazaki understands children so much that he grasps the different layers of childhood representing them like the small and average rabbit, he knows a kid of four will be playful and incapable of reasoning or being reasoned while an older one will still be innocent but aware of the tough implications of the world.<br/><br/>But once Totoro is there, Satsuki and Mei are both incarnations of the spirit of childhood, they literally jump at his tummy and fly together, this is a magnificent scene but we've seen flying already in Miyazaki, how about perhaps the most iconic moment where the two sisters and Totoro wait for a bus, and Satsuki gives him an umbrella. We talked about moments where nothing happens, whatever this scene is supposed to mean is secondary beyond the fact it inspires a wild smile and a certain warmth... and that it introduces the second iconic creation of Myazaki, the Chesire-like cat-bus. 
Only a mind that understands children can be that creative... and Miyazaki knows childhood with the same intelligence as he respects ours, he knows the kids won't jump in the cat-bus, they're waiting for their father. For all the magic and fantasy the film carries, it's only because it's rooted in the reality of the world, incarnated by the beautiful landscapes or the sickness of the mother or relationships between parents and children or inter-generational, that we're transported by Totoro. He only pops up when reality is sometimes too tough to handle, even for children.<br/><br/>And I can't imagine any children not being responsive to the film, Walt Disney said that every film should have morale, for every laugh there should be a tear, that one scare or two can be stimulating but while ""My Neighbor Totoro"" has some dramatic tension, this is a film consistently gentle and sweet about its own material as if a world where Totoro didn't need villains or antagonists to make its point. As ifTotoro was the master of the film, spiritually. 
Miyazaki took that gentle approach we'll also find in movies like ""Kiki"" or ""Ponyo"", with a basic story and not too fancy animation but a huge emotional outlook just like ""Dumbo"" was the most popular Disney film while not as sophisticated as ""Fantasia"" or ambitious as ""Bambi"". <br/><br/>But ""Totoro"" is more than a Japanese Dumbo, it's an icon so popular even the opening song (a catchy march tune) became a children rhyme. No wonder it became the Studio mascot. And since the name refers to an airplane engine. You have the essence of Miyazaki's creation in that blue cardboard opening in each of his films."

","As a 17 year-old boy, I watched this movie for the first time in my life today and I am pretty sure it won't be the last time.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's love of nature is fantastic. I loved the famous rain scene, and the tree growing scene which is -I think- the best scene of the movie. Also Totoro, symbolozing nature was lovely. <br/><br/>I saw my family and my mum's village in this. The love between family members were so great. I watched like: ""Yeah, that's my dad. Yeah this is how I love my mum."" Also the neighborliness makes you smile. People care about each other. When Mei gets lost, everybody stops working and starts looking for her.<br/><br/>Sastuki and Mei are well-created characters. Especially Mei, she loves her sister so much and she always tries to imitate her. Because she is too little, she is not capabele of of understanding some things. For example, she insists that her mother must come home. She is ""innocent"" and that's why she is the most lovely character. Her caring sister Sastuki is a mature child, because she looks after and tries to protect her sister during her mother's long absence. I loved Satsuki more than any other character(maybe that's because I don't have elder brother or sister, but I have a sister-that's why my emphaty for Satsuki were stronger than other characters-.<br/><br/>I am sure Kanta loves Satsuki but he is embarrassed to talk to her. I can't express his feelings in English that's the end.<br/><br/>Not as good as Spirited Away, but still one of the greatest animations of all time. A well-deserved 9/10."

","Director Hayao Miyazaki has certainly made his mark with the IMDb audience. If I'm not mistaken, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" joins four other of his films in IMDb's Top 250 movies. I've now seen them all, and probably come away from them with ""Howl's Moving Castle"" as the most appealing to me.<br/><br/>The version of this film I saw was the Studio Ghibli/Disney rendering, and perhaps it was a by-product of that translation, but I was surprised with the pronunciation of the name 'Totoro'. It was rendered as 'Toe' tuh ro' with the emphasis on the first syllable, whereas before I knew that, I would have pronounced it 'Tuh tor' ro, with the emphasis on the second syllable. Maybe that's anglicizing it, I don't know, but it sounded a little off to me.<br/><br/>What stood out to me were some of the concepts that came out of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"", with elements like Mei falling down a tunnel (replacing the rabbit hole), and later on with the appearance of the smiling Cheshire Cat bus. I don't know enough about Miyazaki to know whether he was influenced by the Alice story, but he did something similar in ""Howl's Moving Castle"" when the Witch of the Waste was defeated by a bucket of water, a nod to Frank Baum's ""The Wizard of Oz"". I acknowledge that it's difficult to come up with something creatively original and brand new, but those two examples suggest that Miyazaki borrowed some of his ideas from other sources.<br/><br/>The story itself is quite charming in it's way, and the two young girls role model an ideal family relationship. What bothered me was the way the story left their mother's condition unnamed except to say that she was ill and confined to a hospital. For some reason, the idea that some form of mental illness may have been involved kept intruding while I watched the story. There was nothing overt to suggest that, but neither was there a reasonable expectation offered that she would be out of the hospital any time soon, and I kept wondering about that.<br/><br/>What I liked most was the imagination that came up with 'soot gremlins' and the titled Totoro itself, along with those little ghost-like apparitions that followed along. Even though a haunted theme was mentioned more than once, it didn't seem to affect Satsuki and Mei, who were innocent enough not to be fearful of the unknown. That was probably the most charming aspect of the story, and if one were to ask about a recommendation to watch the film, I'd suggest following the acorns."

","I watched this movie countless number of times with my small children.<br/><br/>There isn't a lot to tell to be honest. Not from my perspective. The drawing is, as usual with Hayao Miyazaki movies, exceptional and the soundtrack sublime.<br/><br/>My neighbor Totoro is a simple story of two girls, relocating with their father in the countryside to be near to the hospital where the sick mother is taken care of. There is nothing much else to be honest.<br/><br/>So, why a 10/10? Simply because it is such a nice movie. Nice in its purest form. There isn't any opposition. In 99.999% of the movies there is always a conflict. Not necessarily a fight or war between two factions or two persons, but the notion of conflict is almost always there. Most of times the distinction is clear and driven by the scenario. Sometimes the distinction is not that clear. And then there are the 0.001% movies left: the ones where there is zero conflict at all.<br/><br/>Some people may find this absence of conflict boring, I find it refreshing. Don't get me wrong though. That doesn't mean the movie is empty, because there are emotions popping out as you watch it. Mainly positive and kind emotions, but equally there is some tension. All adults won't necessarily feel the tension. Adults that were never in this kind of situation won't understand what feeling they are supposed to have. <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE<br/><br/>The tension is present when actually the girls find out through a telegram that their mother needs to stay longer at the hospital. But they don't know why and start to panic! Did their mother became REALLY sick she is going to die? Why? And the smallest girl, incapable to wait longer to have the answer, leaves the home and try to join the hospital which is hours by walk from home. The father is absent at that moment and the older girl launches herself trying to find her lost little sister being afraid she will never find her back.<br/><br/>And as an adult, ex-children, you recall this tension of not knowing immediately what is going on.<br/><br/>Nowadays it won't make a lot of sense since we are totally interconnected with smartphones and apps, and you get notifications almost instantly, but try recalling when you where a children and there weren't any mobile phone. Try recalling when your parents where late, really late, to pick you up at school and you started panicking thinking something awful happened, an accident, the house on fire or god knows what other horrible incident, and that you'll be left alone, with your siblings and no one to take care of you. Well, the movie succeeds in making you recall this emotion, stress, panic, you had when you were a kid. That is the tension the movie creates and does it in an extremely sensible, kid-perspective, manner.<br/><br/>It's a real gem."

","My Neighbor Totoro was the first anime that I saw. It was also the first time I saw writing other than English. I found it so captivating that it fixed my impression on Japanese animation for many years.<br/><br/>Two girls and their father move to the country side in rural Japan, while the mother is in the hospital for tuberculosis (Drafts for the film place the setting in 1958).The girls encounter what their father identifies as spirits, which only children can see. The girls call them Totoros. As far is plot and story, there isn't a lot that goes on. Most of the scenes involve the girls interacting with the spirits. On paper that may not sound like an interesting film, but like Disney, Miyazaki really knows how to make sequences like this very engaging and captivating.<br/><br/>There isn't any significant plot until towards the end, where the girls are told, through a poorly worded telegram, that their mother is sick. The youngest one attempts to walk to the hospital herself to see her (a two hour walk through dense farmland) and loses her way. Ultimately, Totoro and the other spirits save the day in a thrilling and captivating climactic sequence.<br/><br/>My Neighbor Totoro was released on the same bill as another Ghibli film ""Grave of the Fireflys"". No two films can be more opposite. Since the latter was about two orphaned children at the end of WWII, thus making it a depressing film, it was decided to produce a more lighthearted film to release alongside it. But ultimately, Totoro became the mascot of Studio Ghibli and has gained iconic status in popular Japanese culture and later American culture.<br/><br/>Totoro is a film that ranks alongside the greatest Disney films. It's a film that can be enjoyed by the entire family."

What a disaster! But, a disaster with a fine message.<br/><br/>Totoro, like every Miyazaki film, is a glorious soundscape. No less than the script and visuals, sounds--her own, verbal and not, and those around her reflected in her every squeak and movement, every sigh, every audible breath--establish the younger child, Mei, as protagonist. Without her unique pass, we have no entrance into the film. This old VHS, besides lopping off so much of the frame that ambient sounds too often make little sense anyway, mutes that part of the soundtrack in favor of vocals, killing nature and Mei along with it as surely as the 'villains' in so many other Ghibli films kill Nature.

I only have to add that even though in recent years Disney has dubbed (very nicely, too) Princess Mononoke and Kiki's Delivery Service, it was *Fox Video*, in conjunction with Troma, Inc., that is responsible for this video's release in 1993."
"mikvance","5","9","34","19 March 2007"," Irritatingly Sugary-Sweet
","There's no doubt that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius, but even Spielberg has made some clunkers in his time. My Neighbor Totoro is a beautiful animated tale with plenty of interesting character animation and breathtaking backgrounds. However, it takes exactly 30 minutes before the a ""totoro"" (the titular fictional creature) actually appears and then another 30 minutes before it does anything worthwhile. In between nothing happening, the characters are irritating sugary-sweet. The dialogue is so unoffensive that I was offended. Miyazaki-san is known for being a nature lover and usually animates cautionary tales about disrespect for nature. Sometimes this message is subtle; the rest of the time he wallops the audience over the head with it. This film is not even suitable for children as it slugs along with no pulse. On those rare occasions when a Totoro does appear, the creature's on screen interaction with the children is quirky and creative. When the creature is not on screen the humans trade sugary-sweet pleasantries back and forth ad nauseam. The girls are hyperactive but never once disciplined by their kind, but dull father. The sisters never once bicker and I must question why Miyazaki must have their panties showing whenever they run fast. The human characters once sat around and yapped about sharing fresh vegetables with one another. Why waste dialogue on how good a cucumber tastes? Where's the plot? There's no conflict or even a lesson to be learned. If you can stomach the overly-sweet dialogue and lack of a conflict for a full hour, you just may survive the last half-hour when something finally does happen. The last half-hour does not redeem the movie, instead its what should have been the movie all along!"

","I recommend this movie to all the adults.<br/><br/>because it contains a lot of nostalgic scenes which remind us of our good old days.<br/><br/>For example, you can enjoy seeing beautiful Japanese nature such as a huge forest as well as old school buildings, old-fashioned bus stops and houses, which we have already lost.<br/><br/>Actually, we don't have such natural forests as those in this movie.<br/><br/>The forests around us often have artificially trimmed trees.<br/><br/>I believe that this is a heeling movie good for those who are stressed and want to be happy."

","I've got 4 or 5 Miyazaki movies, and I love them all. Unfortunately I did not find myself quite getting into this one. It really seems for kids, even more than his other movies. I've watched them all multiple times and will watch them again, but I think it'll be a rare night when I pull this out of the collection for a re-view. I suppose I'm happy to have seen it at least once though.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't really have much of a story, and if it weren't for Totoro being around, it would be pretty mundane. It picks up a little as Totoro helps the little girl find her sister and then go off to visit her mom in the hospital. If you can get them to sit still long enough, kids should love it because it still has that Miyazaki feel. It just seems like it was made a little more for kids than his other movies were."

And I just do not get the appeal. The stories are sort of interesting with that fantasy element that is unique to the Japanese. But the animation is pretty weak, and it seems even sillier once you add the dubbing. (Of course subtitles would fix this, but nothing can fix the silly animation.) Some day it will make sense to me maybe... then again, probably not. But I probably never have to see any anime again so long as I live, as I have now checked them all off the IMDb 250."

","To put it simply, this beloved animation is fairly boring. 'My Neighbour Totoro (1988)' is unable to make up for its lack of story - or, at least, proper plot - and characters even with its generally beautiful and inventive aesthetic, the inclusion of which is really its only saving grace and provides its limited - but somehow still genuine - charm. The only shot that amused me was one of a water drop hitting a frog on the head, a simple but effective moment that's totally inconsequential and completely detached from the narrative, but there is somehow an overall pleasurable vibe to the piece. This is created by the innocence of its characters and the innocuous craziness of some visuals. It feels quite palpable, despite the experience also being pretty dull, and prevents the piece from slipping into totally terrible territory. 4/10"
"siderite","7","2","5","11 September 2005"," Cute anime. Childhood/sisterhood/nature spirits
","I think this is a movie made especially for children. It doesn't have a lot of tension or conflict, nor does it have dangers of any kind, feelings of doom or people dying as many of the Japanese productions used us with. Long story short, two girls and their father await for the mother to come out of the hospital. Meanwhile wonderful things happen, like the friendship with a huge teddy bear like creature which seems to be a forest spirit.<br/><br/>Saying that, I am 28 years old and I liked it a lot :), even if not so much as other Myiazaki cartoons, so it's not only for kids. It did seem a bit long for me at times, but after its 90 minutes length I felt bad that it ended so soon. If you get over the first 30 minutes, which are a bit slow paced, you will probably enjoy this animation film."

Also that scene where the father and the girls are in the bath. Whats more disturbing is that the little girl looked as if she sat on his genitals. I swear like you call this a child's film???? OK so I know it said that in the east that the bathroom can be shared with the family but at the same time, you think to yourself, is he a good father after all?

The 2 girls mother is in hospital, but the audience is never told why.<br/><br/>Totoro, the mystical creature, is cute and cuddly like a large teddy bear, and this will make the film very appealing to kids, but there isn't much to keep anyone else interested.<br/><br/>One of the characters who babysits the kids likes to be called ""Granny"" by everyone, and one of the girls does not like to spend time alone with her, now this does seem perverted as if the character may be a paedophile, but nothing happens in the story to tell us this.<br/><br/>I rate this film a 5/10, decent animation, decent plot for young children, however that is about it, but I strongly urge you to see the film at least once!"

","You won't see the brilliance of some of the later Miyazaki films (""Spirited Away"", ""Kiki Delivery Service"", ""Howl's Moving Castle"", etc.) in this early (1988) Studio Ghibli production. Some of the trademark Miyazaki visually arresting elements are there - particularly the fantastic catbus. His mastery of artistic representations of natural elements (rainstorms, waves, etc.) which made ""Spirited Away"" and ""Ponyo"" such true works of art are here only in a pale reflection. ""Tonari No Totoro"" also does not delve into epic storytelling of war and environmental collapse as the later works do but does tell an mildly uplifting child's story of coping with sickness and displacement using the power of imagination. In short, if you are already a fan of Miyazaki, you should see the film to round out your experience. If not eschew this one in favor of his later more mature work."

It's a very nice movie to keep a copy of, just to show your kids how to have fun outdoors and let their imagination thrive, instead of playing with the electronic gadgets and get cooped up indoors like many kids do these days. The movie doesn't show any hostility, although it shows real kids' bickering.

"Vartiainen","Null","1","2","9 September 2015"," I learned
","Sometimes, however rarely, it is possible to tell a story without an enemy, yet still have meaning, to tell something that matters. Something that changes those who hear it. Surely, all stories require conflict. Change, something happening, is conflict in and on itself, for change means that something has to go away, to die, even if it is just an idea of a moment. But conflict does not have to be an enemy.<br/><br/>I learned that from My Neighbor Totoro.<br/><br/>I also learned how to walk through a house yard, viewing it through the eyes of a child. I learned that tall grass can hide wondrous creatures and that it can be a pretty scary place. Overgrowing forests are a labyrinth, a place to get lost, but also to find something. Not all monsters have to be scary, even if they might look and sound like it. The spookiest grin might belong to the nicest person.<br/><br/>Children believe in magic. For them dreaming is the same as the waking world. The older we grow the more we start to lose this truth, but as long as we're still children, we remember. If we're lucky, we realize, at some point in our lives, that dreams are important, for they are hope. And hope is the thing that allows us to step out of our doors. But often we realize this too late, if at all.<br/><br/>Trees can grow overnight into mighty giants. And the oldest trees have power of their own. Empty houses are never truly empty. It's nice to have a roadside roof to hold the rain, though umbrellas are mighty useful as well. Laughter keeps thunder from being too scary, every old lady should be called a grandma and the reason no adult believes in trolls is because they can turn invisible.<br/><br/>All this I learned from My Neighbor Totoro."

And Totoro, the eponymous no-neck cat/rabbit thing, while having no dialog, burst with likable personality. The animation here is nothing short of gorgeous.

"lenii1337","9","1","2","31 December 2013"," ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a wonderful family film
","Childhood is a blossoming period of learning and developing one's own idiosyncrasies. It has always been a sedate stage in which little youngsters define themselves through their senseless antics—ones that appear innocent but are of an elusive nature, and are merely an inadvertent expression of the capricious phase that is childhood. However, since kids are so full of youthful tendencies, very few directors have managed to portray the rascals in a sincere and realistic manner. But among those select few is an irreplaceable Ghibli film which has become a sensation both within its native community and the western world—and that film is Hayao Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro.<br/><br/>My Neighbor Totoro is, simply put, a child's imagination brought to life; fanciful tales that become reality, replete with picturesque wonders that reveal the magical and mysterious. Hidden from adult eyes, the otherworldly rewards only those of pure heart. Spirits and mystic guardians of the forest, they embody the creativity and candidness of children—content to experience the simple joys of life and the beauty of nature. With down-to-earth characterization, Satsuki and Mei are splendid lenses into the film's world, their optimism and enthusiasm ensuring every little discovery resonates with the audience—a magical tale that is an adventure for kids, and an opportunity to revisit childhood for adults; a genuine moment of reflection.<br/><br/>Although the setting lacks depth, My Neighbor Totoro alleviates this by deftly weaving together fantasy and realism. Very little is explained and detailed, but its integration of the imaginary is both natural and unobtrusive. A big house nestled amidst greenery, uninhabited for decades, a likely home to the mysterious. Satsuki and Mei, true to their age, are explorers of the unknown—their interactions with the rich environment are not only a delight to observe, but also a reflection of the curiosity inherent within every child.<br/><br/>Unveiled with mystique, uncanny soot creatures emerge from the house's floor and scamper into the shadows as the heroines enthusiastically tour the dark rooms of their new abode. Even if slightly scared at first, Satsuki and Mei's fear quickly gives way to curiosity, then excitement, and finally delight. The two adventurous sisters stumble upon a new world, and like any child would, wholeheartedly embrace its magic. This very sense of wonder is what leads them to the mythical spirit Totoro, protector and guardian of the forest. Intimidating in size, but gentle in nature, the fuzzy giant embraces the two of them with otherworldly tenderness. In an ever-so-subtle way, he becomes a link between the characters and the forest itself, introducing them to many of its magic wonders.<br/><br/>In essence, My Neighbor Totoro is more about inspiring one's imagination—an honest message about the importance of childhood and a connection with nature—than creating a fantasy backdrop. Complexity is absent, but the presentation is delivered with finesse and flair. Much of this is due to the laid-back pace and the amiable guidance of the protagonists, slowly hinting at the mysteries that may be hidden in the nooks and crannies of dark rooms and lush forests. All the viewer needs to do is to sit down, relax, and enjoy the magic unfold.<br/><br/>Allowing their daughters the liberty to go and explore the surroundings of their new home, Satsuki and Mei's parents are often absent physically, but present in spirit. As caring guardians, the parents concern themselves with their troublesome daredevils in an earnest and honest fashion. These carefree dynamics connect the otherwise distant adult world with the children's, instilling a sense of trust and intimacy among the family. In this sense, Miyazaki makes a conscious effort of displaying human relationships in a sincere and natural style.<br/><br/>True to Ghibli's reputation, My Neighbor Totoro's visuals are masterfully crafted with great attention to even the most minute details. Rich with body language and facial expressions, the screenplay succeeds in the art of showing and not just telling, breathing nuance and realism into the cast's actions and interactions. These subtleties add striking believability to the characters, as adults and children alike look and behave according to their ages. The physical environments, too, are vividly detailed, setting the stage for the integration of the cast and fantasy—be it the cluttered rooms of a house recently moved into, or the green vastness and richness of the countryside.<br/><br/>Likewise, the film's sound department is remarkably well-polished. Joe Hisaishi's compositions harmoniously blend with the mood of the scenes—the tempo is upbeat in situations of excitement and discovery, while smooth when tension is low. The timing is delicate, but more than anything, the tracks themselves are what stand out most. Charming and varied, the melodic tunes make extraordinary scenes even more memorable. The careful management not only soothes body and mind, but also permits the soundtrack to lace key scenes with vivid and meaningful tonality. Interesting to note, though, is that for most of the movie, there is no background music. Instead, focus is placed on environmental sounds, allowing the countryside setting to weave its own atmosphere. In concordance with the naturalistic tone of the story, this adds a more organic touch to the presentation—one focused on painting nature in its purest form.<br/><br/>A tale intended for kids, yet a journey fit for audiences of all ages, My Neighbor Totoro is a splendid story that encapsulates the beauty of childhood. The film's wonderful portrayal of Satsuki and Mei's imagination conveys a true sense of jollity present in most children. Beyond its realism, the film delivers a dazzlingly magical experience by way of its supernatural encounters with the manifestations of nature. But this occurs ever so gently, that one could consider it a dream-like tale that both begins and ends in blissful serenity. A true classic, My Neighbor Totoro will remain in the hearts of many as a heartwarming experience of one of the purest and most beautiful memories: a frolicsome childhood, never to be forgotten."

","I watched Totoro after Spirited Away and is a little disappointed about this movie. The style of drawing is still warm and nice. But the plot is plain and predictable. The loveliness of Totoro is amazing but the way the story ends is no more than cliché. Totoro maybe the dream friend to girls like transformers to boys. The plump, cute and powerful holy friend just caters to girls' unrealistic imagination about someone that can protect her. Boys are crazy about transformers just the way girls fan Totoro. But one thing is different: with the accompany of bumblebee, boys are able to protect himself, his family and fighting against evil while girls keep wondering Totoro to take care of herself and fulfil some painstaking goals. However, Spirited Away encourage us to save the family and pursuit love, with some lucky help from lovely spirits."

","When a man moves with his two young daughters(who are credible, with their child-like energy and their enthusiasm, that does give in to fear and doubt at times) to be closer to his hospitalized wife, the girls both begin seeing nature spirits. As they try to deal with their mother's illness, they experience amazing things with the imaginative creatures, including King Totoro, a large, fuzzy teddy-bear that smiles a lot and the many-legged Catbus. I suppose the main argument against this is the lack of real conflict(and without that, you don't really have a story), and the fact that the 10-year-old Satsuki(gesundheit) and the 4-year-old Mei can be rather obnoxious. Some will say that this doesn't need it; it's about the enchanting world(and it certainly is that). In addition to the magic, this does paint a convincing picture of the situation. This builds an atmosphere so effortlessly you barely believe it. The animation is smooth and ""feels"" real, including the setting of rural Japan, decades ago. There is a nice level of expression to the faces, especially the eyes. A cynic of many years, I will admit that this *did* win me over, yes, it is cute, the youngest of the 2 siblings is adorable(at times). There is some realistic kid dialog in this. The acting is great. If this does not tug at your heartstrings at least a bit, it may be time for a checkup. This is a truly well-done, sweet film that you can show children and they may love it, and it *isn't* pure garbage made with the sole intent being profit. There is nothing offensive in this. The DVD comes with a trailer for this, one for Kiki's Delivery Service and one for Howl's Moving Castle. I recommend this to any fan of fantasy. 8/10"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","2","10 July 2010"," Family-oriented Miyazaki tale and perhaps his most heartwarming story
","Hayao Miyazaki and his company Studio Ghibli are known widely as masters of sophisticated and creative hand-drawn anime, supreme imagination and heartfelt stories. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is one of the first Miyazaki classics, ranking high in heart and animation but slightly lower on the fantasy end in comparison to his later work.<br/><br/>Like many of his films, ""Totoro"" is set in the country. A young girl and her little sister move to a new home in the countryside with their dad while their mom is sick in the hospital. They come to believe their new home is haunted when the younger sister, Mei, discovers a forest spirit named Totoro, a large round creature resembling a bear with pointy ears and whiskers with an affinity for napping inside large trees.<br/><br/>""Totoro"" is certainly the most child-friendly of Miyazaki's classics. There is no force for evil with the plot revolving around simple family drama. Only our curiosity at the world of forest spirits that Miyazaki withholds from us for so long in this film drives us to watch the entire thing. Sadly, this world does not blossom with imagination anywhere near the way it does in Miyazaki's later films. Totoro himself represents a source of comfort. For all intents and purposes he is merely an imaginary friend, a way for the girls to escape from reality and forget about their ill mother. A huge plus on the emotional side of things for this film, but not much good when it comes to filling our fantasy quota.<br/><br/>The characters are some of the strongest people Miyazaki has ever created. The relationship between the two sisters holds the truth and humanity of the story. Even their father, who actually encourages their imagination instead of the expected ""parent who tells them things aren't real"" character archetype. The Disney English dubbing of the film does a terrific job in casting young Dakota Fanning and her sister Elle for the voice parts of Satsuki and Mei. Somehow in spite of their age they understand that these girls require a voice quality that it is much different from typical American children, for example. As siblings, this certainly made the connection between their characters even stronger.<br/><br/>""Totoro"" has its classic scenes such as the one when Totoro shows up at the bus stop and Satsuki gives him her umbrella and when Mei chases some forest sprites into the woods, but the fantasy stops there. It simply is not integral to this story. ""Totoro"" is more of a country fairytale, something much different that the Disney cannon or the Wester cannon of children's stories and animation. It aims to tell a story of childhood and family with a slightly fantastical element to it rather than a wildly imaginative fantasy with family roots.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Check out my site http://moviemusereviews.com"
"griffolyon12","10","1","2","27 July 2009"," A Truly Heartfelt Adventure!
","Hayao Miyazaki's films always seem to amaze me. Whether it be the dense and extremely poignant Princess Mononoke, or the beautiful and deeply affecting Spirited Away, he always manages to capture the viewer's imagination, but no other film in his catalog manages to ensnare the viewer quite like My Neighbor Totoro. In a way it is very different than many of his other films.<br/><br/>My Neighbor Totoro is a simple film, but told in a very affecting way. It's the story of two young girls who move to the country with their father so that they can be near their ailing mother in the hospital. While at their new home the girls discover an ancient forest spirit called Totoro that can only be seen by children, and Totoro helps them to find hope within all their inner turmoil.<br/><br/>It is safe to say that My Neighbor Totoro is quite possibly Miyazaki's most human film he has ever made. While there are many other Miyazaki films that are perhaps more breathtaking in scope and may have far more intriguing plots, My Neighbor Totoro puts all of its focus on the characters rather than the fantasy. As a matter of fact the fantasy within the film is very sparse, and appears at all the right moments to strike the perfect chord with your emotions. Though this should not lead one to believe the film doesn't have some awe-inspiring fantasy. It wouldn't be a Miyazaki film if it didn't. There are many sequences, such as the catbus scenes or the flight with Totoro that are simply magical and help solidify this film amongst the pantheon of other Studio Ghibli productions.<br/><br/>Miyazaki makes the smart choice of telling the story through the eyes of the children rather than giving it a cynical adult spin. In doing this he draws us into this world; you literally feel as if you stepped in a time machine and went back into your childhood. The children treat the world as if it's this magical place, full of mystery and wonder. We never see the dark side of human nature within this film, cause as children we never did. What Miyazaki does show is how to enjoy life and its simplicities, but not only that he makes us remember that it's alright to feel emotion; to be scared, to laugh, to cry. As adults we very often forget these simple things, bottling everything up, making us bitter and cynical beings.<br/><br/>Of course My Neighbor Totoro is just as gorgeous as any other Studio Ghibli production. My Neighbor Totoro features some of the finest hand-drawn animation I've ever seen. It's amazing that this was done back in the days before computers. Many of the shots are so complex to draw that most animators would shy away from doing without a computer, but not Miyazaki. Now while some fans may despise the dubbed versions of Miyazaki's films done by Disney, I've never minded them, and this is easily one of their better dubs thus far. Dakota and Elle Fanning are perfect as the two sisters. Their authentic chemistry really comes through on screen.<br/><br/>Overall My Neighbor Totoro is a funny, heartwarming film. Miyazaki perfectly struck a chord with the audience on this one. It's an innocent look back at childhood, bringing back the sheer wonder that following a mysterious animal in the backyard could have. Though what this film truly does is make us as adults forget what we are truly missing, but as Totoro does with the girls, Miyazaki shows that there is hope in us rediscovering that innocence and simplicity once more.<br/><br/>I give My Neighbor Totoro a beautiful 10 out of 10!"
"ThreeSadTigers","Null","1","2","29 December 2007"," Probably the definitive Hayao Miyazaki masterpiece.
","My Neighbour Totoro is probably the film that introduced many western audiences to the work of esteemed Japanese animator/director Hayao Miyazaki and his celebrated production house Studio Ghibli. It is a film that I have fond memories of, having first discovered it as part of a mid-90's Sky Movies double (alongside my personal favourite Miyazaki film Porco Rosso) when I was around nine or ten years old. It stayed with me for many years before unavailability led me to record it off the TV sometime around 2001, where I found, much to my surprise, that the film was every bit as touching, endearing and enchanting as it had first seemed so many years before.<br/><br/>Finally, some kind soul has decided to re-release all of the Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli productions as a collection of re-mastered DVD editions, including everything from his Lupin III instalment The Castle of Cagliostro to the more recent epic fantasy adventure, Howl's Moving Castle (2004), which, like almost everything that Miyazaki has been involved with before, offer us a series of intricate story lines, breathtaking visuals, memorable characters and a general approach to bold, imaginative, unique and utterly compelling family entertainment that will almost certainly appeal to anyone between the ages of eight and eighty (urgh, sorry for the cliché!!). My Neighbour Totoro remains, perhaps, the definitive Studio Ghibli production, with Miyazaki here perfecting the visual style that would subsequently become his trademark, as well as developing a number of thematic devices that would be further explored in later projects like Kiki's Delivery Service, Porco Rosso and Spirited Away.<br/><br/>The story takes place in the rural Japan of the 1950's, where two young girls and their father move into an old house near the forest in an attempt to distract the girls from the absence of their mother, who is recovering from tuberculosis in a nearby convalescence home. Whilst exploring the forest, the two girls discover a family of ""forest spirits"", the biggest of which they christened Totoro (a mispronunciation of ""tororu"", the Japanese word for troll), who allows the two girls to partake in their nightly adventures. With the film, Miyazaki and his team create a depiction of the perfect summer and the power of imagination, as they use the two children to act as a representation for the audience. Mei, the younger of the two sisters, comes to represent the youngsters within the audience, as she approaches the Totoro characters with wide eyes and enthusiasm and generally accepts each of their adventures to be a continuation of her imagined child-like sense of fabrication. Satsuki, the older of the two girls, straddles the line between childhood and pre-teen adolescence. Her character is often more cynical and level-headed than her younger sister, and therefore she is the perfect representation for an adult audience who may need to put aside their own sense of scepticism when approaching a film that is so shameless magical.<br/><br/>The story is fantastic, with Miyazaki allowing the action to unfold slowly... bringing the girls (and the audience) into the world of totoro slowly so that the introduction of the ""soot spirits"" and the mythical king of the forest doesn't seem too jarring when dropped into a film that evokes such a plausible and believable depiction of reality (as with all the films of Studio Ghibli, Totoro has an almost obsessive attention to detail, with the texture of the locations and the use of light and shadow drawing you further and further into the film as a whole). The atmosphere throughout is perfect, whilst the characters (both in design and portrayal) are excellent, with the two young girls setting the template for Miyazaki's aforementioned later films, Kiki's Delivery Service and Spirited Away, whilst the design of the mythical Totoro would become an important piece of iconography within Japanese animation (he's used as the Studio Ghibli logo, and is available in a range of plush-toy incarnations!!).<br/><br/>As with the majority of Miyazaki's work, Totoro has deeper themes lurking beneath the surface of the story... Here, it is the idea of childhood and imagination (and really the power of imagination, which is central to all Miyazaki's work) being worn down by the approach of adolescence. It has also been seen as a metaphorical piece, with the relationship between the girls and Totoro being an imagined one in order to take their minds off the temporary loss of their mother and their concerns over her health (a factor that probably accelerates Satsuki's desire to grow up?). Whether or not you choose to interpret the story on such a level is entirely up to you, with the film working just fine as a lovely piece of family entertainment, with a warm and ultimately uplifting story being elevated by that gorgeous design/animation, the larger than life characters, and the story that manages to create fantastical characters and enchanting underworlds, without feeling the need to view them with a crass irony or an air of damaging cynicism (something that can't be said about the majority of Hollywood animation).<br/><br/>My Neighbour Totoro is an exceptional film... one that has the power to enthral children and adults alike (another woeful cliché... but it's true!!!) with its evocative story, memorable characters and shades of hidden depth. If you've never seen a Hayao Miyazaki film before, then this is a great place to start, and is really an essential purchase alongside Porco Rosso, Kiki's Delivery Service, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle."
"native_girl333","9","1","2","6 April 2007"," Simply Totoro
","""Tonari no Totoro"" continues the glorious path of Hayao Miyazaki's animation features. ""Totoro"" is Studio Ghibli's oldest production and it was just released on DVD in Finland for the first time.<br/><br/>I have always been a huge fan of Japanese animation. When I was a child my favorite animation feature told the story of a little orphan girl named Candy. The music in Miyazaki's pictures reminds me of Candy. Music plays an enormous role in Miyazaki's cartoons. It is very emotional and touching.<br/><br/>In Finland there is always dubbed version but I always watch animations in their original language. Then a movie feels more authentic and real.<br/><br/>In ""Totoro"" the plot is very simple but it emphasizes the importance of family. The relationship between the sisters Satsumi and Mei is so strong. Another interesting thing in Miyazaki's stories is that you never know what kind of creatures there is going to be this time. Totoro's character brings a little magic to the ordinary life.<br/><br/>The movie can be recommended to all ages!"
"jorsle","10","1","2","18 March 2007"," Great film!
","This is an amazing film, both adventurous and really cute. And it's appealing to everyone, especially children no matter nationality. I saw it in original language with English subtitles with a 7 year old Norwegian girl (whom cannot read English), and she loved it and haven't talked about any other movie since. That's really an example on how good this film is.<br/><br/>Tonari no Totoro is coming to Norway in the end of March, Norwegian and Original dubbing, and I know that it will be a great adventure for those who see it.<br/><br/>I know that some may call this film naive and too simple, even for kids. But that is, for me, not a problem. You don't always need serious movies, at least not for kids."
"browneyes_88","9","1","2","23 November 2006"," Positively adorable!
","This movie was probably the cutest movie I've seen in my entire life. It made me smile from beginning to end. It starts with a father and his two little girls moving to a new house. The girls encounter friendly spirits that live near their new house in the forest. Totoro is one of the spirits, a big lovable creature, who is always there to help the little girls. Plus the friendly neighbors add happiness to the movie. There was not a single part that seemed unnecessary or too over the top. It left the viewer feeling happy and content when it ended. It's good for every age and I would highly recommend seeing it. Miyazaki wins the cuteness award for this movie."
"ravedude","10","1","2","11 November 2006"," The most magical movie of all time.
","It amazes me how timeless this movie has become for me, not to mention the influence over the years.<br/><br/>There is a subtle magic in this film that stays with you for the rest of your life. For me, that magic has made this movie my #1 film. The Studio Ghibli team combined with Hayao Miyazaki are a powerful mix.<br/><br/>Currently I have watched almost all Miyazaki's films, heard most of their music compositions (Joe Hisaishi is a genius, writing music in the language of the soul), and have loved everything about them. My Neighbor Totoro stands out, probably because of its simplicity and way of drawing you in. It's like a return to innocence and childhood, something everyone on Earth (above 18) sorely miss.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching it. Don't miss this one."

","Little known in the US, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is one of the highest grossing films in all of Japanese cinema.<br/><br/>Furry tree spirits, children, and a haunted house in rural Japan come together in a magical world that seems so real at times that you could almost touch it.<br/><br/>Sweet and powerful moments fill this gentle-paced film. It has the surreal beauy of the ""Spirited Away"" - but the story is more intimate, and the presentation has a slightly more handmade feel.<br/><br/>Don't deprive yourself of something this beautiful - get a copy and watch it soon! It may become a permanent part of your psyche."
"youaremy_sunshinex","10","1","2","29 May 2006"," What a Movie...
","I grew up in japan when i was very young, so i had first seen this movie probably when i was about 2 or 3. We moved back to the states shortly after, and i hadn't seen the movie in years. All i could remember was really loving it, and once it recently came out on DVD in English, i was thrilled. As soon as i watched it again, i knew exactly why i was so taken with this movie. Miyazaki combines his brilliant animation with his bright imagination to create a truly spectacular film. The characters are quirky and full of personality, and help pull you into the plot immediately. With it's laugh-out-loud cute parts, beautiful animation and storyline, this will always remain of of my favorite Miyazaki works."
"effix","10","1","2","13 April 2006"," Magical Fantasy Ride, 9.9 on the Cuteness Scale
","I think this piece deserves a 10 because it is a visual feast and it has some very cute & cool fantasy characters. I am male in his late 20's, an animation lover and I loved every minute of it. You would like this if you like fantasy and/or spirituality, kittens, magic and nature. You must also not get easily annoyed by little girls with high voices. Of course you are open to Japanese customs (or else you wouldn't be reading about this Japanese movie). I think the main character Totoro looks cool by just doing nothing (don't worry, he'll do more). If you watch this with your kids, there might be a need for explaining some typical customs, especially when they watch the Japanese version and can't read all the subtitles fast enough. I recommend watching native versions of any foreign movie, that way nothing is lost in translation, arigato."
"uwisplaya","10","1","2","12 April 2006"," Amazing Film
","This film was amazing. I don't know why it took me so long to view it. It joins Aladdin, the Lion King, and Spirited Away in the line-up of great children's flicks. This one just seemed to have so much warmth. I was smiling almost the entire time, wanting to be a kid again. Everyone should see this and remember just what being a kid is all about. It's great how Mei is afraid of Nanny at the beginning, but by the end treats her like her own grandma. Totoro is too cute. While not the centerpiece of the film, he sure does add a great touch to the film. I think this and Spirited Away are Miyazaki's best films, followed closely by Princess Mononoke. This is just such a gem of a movie. So many details make this movie even greater. I know everyone remembers running around in the beginning of the film like Satsuki, making the ""Indian noises."" This truly is a film that touches all ages."
"brainofj72","8","1","2","26 January 2006"," A Beautifully Imaginative Masterpiece
","In my mind, there are only two films that truly capture the essence of a child's imagination. One is Danny Boyle's vividly beautiful Millions, and the other is Hayao Miyazaki's sweet, tender, and utterly gorgeous My Neighbor Totoro.<br/><br/>The story is of two young girls who move to the Japanese countryside with their father while their mother is being treated in the hospital. After settling in, these two children discover that where they live is anything but ordinary. They find a hidden path into the forest, and soon meet Totoro, a giant, furry, and lovable creature.<br/><br/>The film is told strictly from the point of view of these two children. What adults may see as harmless and silly, the children see as amazing and very much real. When the children go on about how they can see ""Soot Gremlins"" and ""Totoro"", the adults simply say that they saw them when they were children as well.<br/><br/>This formula is certainly one we've seen before, but thanks to the genius of Hayao Miyazaki, My Neighbor Totoro takes on a feeling of unbridled imagination never before seen on celluloid. The world he creates is an intimate yet expansive one. The fact that this is one of Miyazaki's most beautifully animated features certainly doesn't hurt this. Everything is gloriously vivid, colorful, and bursting with life.<br/><br/>The manner in which Miyazaki presents the narrative is nothing short of brilliant. The whole time watching the film, we as an audience realize that the girls' mother is suffering from some kind of serious affliction, but this is never really addressed directly. The children don't think about it that way, so the film doesn't approach it that way. This subplot never really develops at all until a sequence near the very end of the film, and this is a very powerful sequence. In order to avoid spoilers, I won't reveal the details, but it certainly struck me with its bittersweet honesty. However, this is still a tender family film through and through, and the ending is one that is sure to bring a smile to your face. And unlike most family films, My Neighbor Totoro is sweet, but never reaches the point of being saccharine. It's an honest, beautiful masterpiece, and I give it my highest recommendation to anyone who can still manage to keep in touch with their inner child from time to time."
"fintalones","9","1","2","10 October 2005"," Wonderful
","Perhaps My Neighbor Totoro is a little slow moving by today's standards, but it has a magic that Disney's films can only wish for. Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli make animation you can get lost in. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Any of Miyazaki's other works are also worth checking out: Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, etc.<br/><br/>I think the reason I'm so drawn to Studio Ghibli's films is because Disney has created the ""fomula animated feature"" and polished it until I became utterly bored and cynical. Studio Ghibli's films are original and magical."
"kengoogloo","10","1","2","18 July 2005"," Break the classic element of movie
","Many movies are somehow based on the classic conflict of Good vs Evil, even for 'innocent' movies like 'Finding Nemo', one of the main theme is to save Nemo from some bad guys.<br/><br/>But in this movie, forget about the mad world and immense yourself in a small Japanese village, through the eyes of two kids. It is about their exploration with the surrounding and how they build bonds with the nature. This movie brings back the feeling of child-like curiosity, and one can spend days in playing with the flowers and other animals.<br/><br/>And perhaps this is how children look at the world, always fun and curious. Now for the adults we somehow see the world as more black and white, good and bad, right and wrong. And I'm not sure who has a better perception about the reality :-)"

I love the color of the art, character's personality, the atmosphere, the sceneries, dream of the characters, the laugh, the sound track, the village live style, the peace and the story, with all these features combined together makes this movie become a masterpiece. Although I am no longer a kid, but its soundtrack still bring me back to my childhood memories. I never feel bore of watching other Hayao Miyazaki's animations because they are all excellent stories. I even have collected all the his animations video at all so I can watch it anytime I want without paying extra dollars."

","A great and creative story. It is about two girls named Satsuki and Mei. Them and their dad move to the countryside. Their mother is in the hospital because of illness. They meet Granny, who helps them to move in the house and is a farmer. The reason that they moved there was because of a gigantic camfer tree.( which looks like about the size of the Empire State Bulding.) When they move in, they find dust bunnies, little creatures made of dust.(of course.) One day Mei Finds a little white thing that can turn invisible. Later, she sees a medium sized blue one with a sack of acorns. Then she goes into the forest and finds the large gray one. The totoros take the two on adventures, and help them deal with their mother in the hospital. A great film and is highly entertaining. In the beginning, the dialog is very annoying."
"zenfroglet","10","1","2","28 May 2004"," One of the best films ever
","I cannot believe it took me around 6 years to finally get to watch this film (on an illegally imported Chinese version, no less). <br/><br/>This is an amazing piece of animation, characters are so endearing and real, the story so magical, it takes me back to my childhood fantasies (yes I did fantasise about having a large owl/rabbit creature as a friend).<br/><br/>I guess some may think of it as a children's cartoon, and children will definitely enjoy it, but adults can enjoy it just as much. I think this is Miyazaki's greatest work alongside the recent Spirited Away. Fantastic works they may be, but with just the right amount of personality mixed in that make them truly human films. <br/><br/>I understand this and other Miyazaki's will soon be legitimately available on western shores this summer, a pity with the big name dubbing, but I guess it will make it more accessible to people, and that is good.<br/><br/>I totally recommend this to anyone."

"pcantrell","10","1","2","7 October 2003"," Subtle and beautiful
","This is one of the most beautifully crafted movies I know of.  It's mostly cute and heartwarming -- funny forest spirits, kids, the Japanese countryside, happy family -- but underlying that are fears far more real and frightening than any bad guy Disney ever concocted: the ill mother, the endangered child.  The main characters are two of the most believable kids I know of in cinema, and we see the world through their eyes: not only the magical worlds of imagination and nature, but also the presence of death and the fragility of happiness.  Don't get me wrong -- it's a very, very happy movie -- but in spite of the wildly imaginative fantasy element, it's a believable happiness because of the other things it acknowledges.  I don't know of another movie than manages to be so incredibly cute and kid-friendly and without compromising an ounce of artistic integrity.<br/><br/>NOTE: I highly recommend AGAINST the dubbed version.  The children in English are whinier and more stereotypical Hollywood kids; they lose some of the intelligence and depth that makes the kids so wonderful in Japanese.  In some movies as visual as this one, the dub is preferable since it lets you focus on those visuals ... but not this one."
"kormakur_g","10","1","2","18 December 2002"," a most wonderful ode to nature and childhood
","Having seen all of Hayao Miyazaki's films I think I can safely say that My Neighbour Totoro is his finest piece. It captures the wonder and magic of childhood and makes you cry with joy. Literally. The film tells the story of two sisters, Mei and Satsuki, who move into an old house in the Japanese countryside with their father, only to find it haunted with Soot Sprites. The girls' exploration of the neighbouring countryside leads them to Totoro, a giant furry, benevolent forest spirit. From then on it's pure adventure and laughter. Almost. Unlike nearly all other children's films, Totoro has no villain, no evildoer or wicked granny. Though Satsuki and Mei must face emotional hardship it is simply the hardship we must all face. Sickness and mortality.<br/><br/>Though it's become a cliche, here it rings true; this film is for children all ages. I've shown this movie to all my friends: jaded and cynical film enthusiasts yet they all fall prey to this film's charm and sincerity. See it."

After I watched this film I wished that all movies were rated G and contained the magic that Miyazaki captured when he made this film. My Neighbor Totoro is a must have for any child, or anyone who is a child at heart."
"steffanmb","10","1","2","6 December 2002"," Beautiful film for film-lovers or children
","This is a great film either for adults or adults looking for a great film for their kids to watch. Unlike other Miyazake films, Totoro is set in contemporary rural Japan, and aims at a younger audience. Like his other films, it is beautifully animated and scored, with an engaging and moving story line. It also centres on a strong girl heroine and a fantasy world. It also has the tightest plot structure of Miyazake's movies, which is to say, it lacks the complexity of his more adult-orientated works. Aside from the wonderful characters and sensitive story-line, it is a great glimpse into Japanese rural life, from roadside shrines to family bathing. It also beats Disney movies hands down for depth of characterization, mood and general quirkiness. And unlike Disney movies, it has a story, rather than a formula. The premise concerns a father and his two daughters who move into an old house while the mother convalesces in a nearby hospital. The story explores the emotions aroused by this move, adjustment to rural life and the mother's illness in an understated way. However, the real fun is the magical parallel world that the girls discover in their backyard."

I saw it three times during its theatrical run and six times on video. When I looked up Miyazaki's filmogrophy I saw that he directed Totoro. I knew that I had to see it one way or another. About four weeks ago I bought the import DVD and I watched it again. I fell in love with it again. It's probably the cutest movie ever. The creature Totoro is the best ""cute-thing"" ever to hit the silver screen. Mei and Satsuki are brilliant. If you don't have time to see the whole movie then just watch the bus-stop scene.

","I saw this film for the first time on Japanese television a couple of years ago. This is one of the few feel-good films I ever saw that drove this normally left-brained engineer to a teary-eyed sentimentality. It is a story about two sisters, Mei and her elder sister Satsuki, who had just moved to a house in the country. Their father, a teacher, looks after them as their mother is ill in the hospital. While playing in the garden, Mei sees a strange furry character and takes after it. The events that follow lead her and Satsuki to a wondrous backyard adventure with magical creatures. Are they real? Imaginary? This film has a cuteness factor that runs off the scale. As it is with most Japanese films, it really needs to be seen in its original language form, subtitled if necessary, rather than the dubbed VHS and DVD forms available in the US."

I was impressed at how dead-on the dynamics of sibling relationships were portrayed, especially in light of what the girls are dealing with. Indeed, the girls the kind of well-rounded characters you simply don't find in American cartoons.

Whenever I look outside and see those same big, puffy, sunny-day clouds, I always tell my kids, ""Those are Totorro Clouds."" This is of course just one example of the amazing drawing and animation in this movie. Beautiful interior shots with amazing detail. Great drawings of people, although I'll never understand why anime always includes the huge round eyes and the cavernous mouths. There's the one scene where the tree grows all the way up to the sky. All hand drawn, it compares favorably to the best computer-assisted animation by Disney, Dreamworks, or the rest. It's just simply beautiful.<br/><br/>Now on to pacing. The thing that really amazes me about this movie (and the thing that makes it superior to the other movies by this director) is that it is such a small, simple little story. Two young girls, ages about 4 and 7 I'm guessing, go out to the country with their father to be near their seriously ill, convalescing mother. Because of their stress, it seems, they meet some comforting mythological creatures who give them a ride around and then take them back home. That's about it.<br/><br/>There are long, drawn-out scenes in the kitchen and in the family bath that you'd never catch in a Disney film. The most beautiful scene of all is that of the two girls waiting at the bus stop for their father to come home from work. They must wait on screen for at least a few minutes. It's astonishingly shocking and effective in its lack of activity. American filmmakers, who are always claiming that their animation is not just meant for children, still feel the need to pack every second of their movies with nonstop noise and action. Totorro, on the other hand, has the pacing you'd hope for if you moved out to the country. It's a simple, melancholy little film that just strikes me as so damn true to life.<br/><br/>I've got plenty of younger friends who are totally into the more hardcore anime, like Akira and Ghost in the Shell. I always tell them to watch this movie. Now they're all fans as well."
"moutelik","10","1","2","11 April 2002"," Unsurpassed beauty
","This is a masterpiece. Some films bring us unforgettable scenes. This is one of them. There is one scene, where the Totoros dance around a flower bed, where the girls had planted some accord seeds. The girls join the Totoros, in this childish dance to make the seeds sprout. To me as an adult, this was such an enchanting scene. To my children (3 and 4 years) it was magic, as we danced like the Totoros. The kids loved it, even not speaking English. I'd like to add a small detail, that can be seen on the DVD: the japanese version is full of silent scenes. In the dubbed version, those silences are almost always filled with some background dialogue. It doesn't spoil the dubbed version, but makes an interesting cultural detail."
"8newk8","10","1","2","24 July 2001"," A masterpiece of animation. Evokes feelings which I thought I had lost with childhood.
","The things which children must cope with are immense and overwhelming.  I think myself lucky to have been safely steered away from such issues as death and loss at an early age, but now that I have seen Tonari no Totoro, I realize that a child's ability to overcome, and the power of the imagination in order to overcome would have helped me through the trauma.<br/><br/>Tonari no Totoro deals with such issues when it takes the story of two young sisters, moving to the country with their father as they wait for their mother to recover from some debilitating illness.  But it is not as depressing as it sounds.  In fact, it has to be one of the most uplifting and life affirming movies I have ever seen.  Why?  Because animator Hayao Miyazaki has such an acute understanding of the mindset -- and the imagination -- of children.  Children deal with emotions they can't understand by creating worlds.  By diving into their imagination, they are able to express these emotions in a positive, uplifting way.<br/><br/>
And this is how the two sisters of this story deal with the potential loss of their mother.  Projecting their problems through a hole they encounter in the forest, they create an imaginary world of forest beasts which act as playmates and protectors.  And the power of their beliefs then make these creatures real.<br/><br/>I gave this video to my niece and nephew before they moved into a new house in a new town.  And although their experience didn't exactly parallel the trauma that the characters in the film experienced, the similarities were sufficient enough so that as soon as they had moved into the new house, and were trying to deal with the unfamiliar surroundings, they had discovered a hole in a hedge, which they subsequently named the ""Totoro hole"", where they could crawl into and find a world all their own, amongst a world they were completely unfamiliar with.  Within weeks, they had introduced all the neighborhood children (their new friends) to the hole, as well as to the film.  Totoro had taken over their new neighborhood!<br/><br/>As an adult, you might find yourself sinking into feelings much like this. A sadness for the loss of the ability to tap into our imaginations in order to overcome all obstacles.  But it also will open things up inside you that you thought were long buried over.  Disney could never achieve such a complex mix of emotions."
"mrincodi","9","1","2","26 April 2001"," A nice movie only for children.
","This movie is very nice. Although the theme is very simple, it's very well drawn and the characters move very well (I got surprised with the animation of the movement of the two girls: they really seem real!)<br/><br/>If you're going to watch or buy it, remember it's a movie _for children_. It's designed in that way, and it's great in that way, so don't expect a great story because it hasn't it. If you want something ""serious"" go for Kokaku Kidotai, Hotaru no Haka (excellent), Nausicaa, Mononoke Hime (these last two by Miyazaki too) or even one of the Rupan Sansei (Lupin III) saga, instead.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10 (again, as a movie designed for children)."
"nathanielqwilson","3","2","7","26 August 2018"," There is no conflict
","For me, the worst movie of its writer and of its studio but then again, I always preferred Fireflies to Mononoke.<br/><br/>The issue of this movie is simple. It doesn't have any conflict. This is the thing that is at the centre of all storytelling. I want to be fair and try to understand what this movie was trying to do. It was not meant to be the resolving antagonism between two forces, but rather a meditation on the good things in life, not the bad. In that respect it isn't badly made. It is a breezy and soothing trek quite perfect for someone recovering in hospital after an emotionally and physically traumatizing experience.<br/><br/>In other movies, one of the little girls would feel spiteful about having to move home or there would be some other type of family disharmony. But here the worst thing going on with these people is the sick mother but even then, we only see her in a convalescent state.<br/><br/>Totoro himself barely does anything but I don't want to reveal too much.
I have exaggerated a little, the movie does try to bring a little conflict for the climax, but it is as contrived and out of the blue as the final act of ""Twilight"". But in ""Twilight's"" defence, they used their climax to explore themes present throughout the book and they are only part one of the ""Twilight Saga"".
It has a professional, verdant design and many instantly icon moments that unfortunately are wasted in having no real context, but they did make me want to like it. It's the five-year-old's birthday party soundtrack that makes me want to dislike it.<br/><br/>I can see myself at 5 being tolerant of this movie even if you have to wait through all the slice of life to get anywhere. I can't see myself at 10 caring for this movie at all. But I can see myself at 30 maybe warming to it eventually. It's not really a movie for kids, it's a movie that organic, gluten free parents want their kids to like.<br/><br/>But if you're trying to find an entry point into Japanimation or are looking for another from its studio/writer, I'd recommend Porco Rosso way before this, even if this one is the more popular."
"hyperzephyrian","6","2","7","28 September 2013"," A Lack of luster
","Let me just say before I actually write the review, that I'm not all that big a fan of Anime. That being said, I'd seen two Studio Ghibli films before watching My Neighbor Totoro, and I enjoyed both. (Tales From Earthsea, and Howl's Moving Castle.) <br/><br/>I also did a bit of research on the film itself before watching it, because being on tumblr I see a lot of references, quotes and insight on the film, and I came across the Murder Theory, and it intrigued me even more.<br/><br/>Although it had a bit of a slow pace, and a running time of an hour and twenty-nine minutes, I made sure I downloaded the Original English Dubbed version, from when Fox owned the rights.<br/><br/>I expected a lot from this film, in part because of the fanbase it has here on tumblr, and also because the two Studio Ghibli films I'd seen previous to that were quite enjoyable. All of this being said, I found the film quite bland in all honesty. The film never reveals what was actually ailing the Mother, and keeping her hospitalized. The film never explained where Mei went, while her sister was losing her mind trying to find her. There were a lot of loose ends in my opinion. <br/><br/>I also never understood how the being came to be called Totoro, all 'Totoro' did was growl and yell, I suppose you'd call it yelling. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm missing something, I don't know. But from my point of view, there was a lack of luster in this film. Totoro was only on screen for maybe 15 minutes in total, and I really had trouble understanding it.<br/><br/>5.9/10"
"bob the moo","Null","2","7","3 September 2006"," Very cute and colourful but the material is surprisingly childish and not as impacting as I had wanted it to be
","With their mother ill in hospital, Satsuki and Mei's father moves them to a new country house. The two girls are excited to find that their house is ""haunted"" and has soot gremlins running wild. Bundles of energy themselves, Satsukie and Mei love the space and the large forest all around them. While her father works and the older Satsuki goes to school, young Mei finds herself in the care of her neighbour ""Granny"". However going wandering alone in the grass, Mei finds another neighbour walking by  a small little spirit creature that live in the woods, just one of three ""Totoro's"" that she befriends.<br/><br/>Having seen screenshots of this film and seeing how cool the Totoro's were I was looking forward to this film. I'd love to be a film snob and pretend that I have known Miyazaki for years, the truth is I have not and know him thanks to the success of Spirited Away. I mention this because I was hoping for the emotional depth in this film that I had with SA and this was another reason I was looking forward to the film. Sadly it was not to be all I had hoped it would have been and, although his films are generally ""critic-proof"", it was hard not to be a bit disappointed with it. Part of the reason was that it was a lot more childish than I expected it to be and it took a long time to really get going and, once it did, it was over. Although the Totoro's are the selling point, the film is really about the humans and how the girls deal with their reality. Perhaps it was the Disney version I saw, but I felt this was badly done and the emotions weren't well developed  rather they came out only in certain scenes and seemed artificial and were unengaging as a result.<br/><br/>Visually the film is professional and polished in the ""human"" scenes but Miyazaki's imagination and style comes out with the Totoro's (which are very cool) and the cat bus (which is weirdly cool). As characters they are both very much side issues though. This is a bit annoying because of how cool they are, but it is actually distracting because of how underdeveloped the main material is. For children I imagine it will be great fun as they will love the girls and the creatures and won't find the story too simplistic. Adults will also love the charm of the creatures but many will struggle with the story that seems to be focusing on the emotions of the family but somehow fails to do it that well. Adults might also find the girls tiring as they are unbelievably cute balls of energy; personally I thought they were fun but I think they would wear me out totally if they were mine! In the Disney version the Fanning sisters do a pretty good job with the voice work. I cannot be sure if the failure of the material is Disney's fault or not but the Fannings do what they can. They are polished and cute but they cannot get consistent emotion in their characters and, when they do, it seems artificially condensed as if the writer had suddenly remembered that his characters had these worries and fears in their little hearts. The Totoros are very cute and quite funny but they are not emotional characters and I was a bit frustrated by them not contributing more to the experience than just being cool.<br/><br/>Overall this is cute, cool and quite fun but those looking for it to even get close to the emotion and depth of Spirited Away will be disappointed. It seems to forget the heart of the story and is all too keen to just frolic with the Totoro before rushing the emotion in an unsatisfying conclusion. Fun, colourful and good for children but, aside from some moments of magic and cool creatures, many adults won't find the material to be strong enough to fully engage with."
"lowercasewestthomas","Null","4","20","11 November 2004"," the dad was a creep.
","I enjoyed the movie, but the dad was a bit nutso. always laughing and talking really loud...And the old lady says ""Eh?"" in about every other scene. At least thats how it is in the English version. I really liked it though. I think little kids would get a kick out of it. All of thew Backgrounds were gorgeous, and it was certainly a unique plot, even if that totoro thing screamed a lot seemingly without reason. I also saw Spirited Away, which I think is less child-friendly. I don't have any kids though, so I don't mind too much. I think that its interesting that the guy made the movie modeled it after his own childhood. Even if his mom was sick, he's making some cash off of it."
"howard_andrew72","1","5","30","17 August 2010"," Why would Disney change the voice acting?
","I agree entirely with little-bird-2. When I was growing up, I would borrow this movie from my local library. I loved it so much. Years passed, and I ended up in a relationship with a person who actually had it on VHS! I was so excited about it, I told her we HAD to watch it that night. Well, fast forward another couple of years... I bought the special edition DVD, and I couldn't wait to watch it. Pop it in, and the first thing I noticed was the opening credits had a different singer. I was a little mad about that, but it was OK. But then the dialog started. I wasted $22.00. Everything was just too strange. The original voices were perfectly fine. If they ABSOLUTELY HAD TO change it, why couldn't they just keep the same dialog at the VERY least?"

However, although I expected better, this movie is good, it deserves our attention. The story is compelling and it is not difficult to follow.
Nevertheless, I didn't understand 100% if Totoro is real or the imagination of the kids. In some scenes it feels like it's real, with real influence on their lives, but no adult as ever seen him, hence, the doubt."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","3","25 November 2019"," The age of innocence
","""Tonari no Totoro"" or ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a Japanese animated movie from 1988, so this one is already over 30 years old and it was written and directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki for Studio Ghibli and the fact that it is one of his most known works, given his tremendous body of work, shows you how well-received it is to this day. So does the fact that this is in the imdb top250, actually top150 even, as at this point it is at 133. I can't really say anything about the voice actors and actresses here. Probably only Japanese can if at all. However, I watched the German dub anyway and I thought it was good. Just heard a really brief moment of the Japanese original because I was a little late and rewatched the first 5 minutes at home and I thought the dad's voice sounded a bit older than he was in the movie. But maybe that is just me. At 85 minutes approximately (including credits already), this was not a long film by any means, but that is perfectly fine because honestly, while I totally think that grown-ups should see this film and enjoy it as much as I did, this is still one of the Studio Ghibli movies that felt more for children, even very young children, than most other works from the production company. And going over 100 minutes really could have hurt the kids' attention span, actually 85 seemed too much already for the ones I watched it with. So fittingly, there were several really young people in the audience during my screening. Glad I got to see this on the big screen now and it was actually the very first time ever I watched it. Also comedy-wise, it is all so harmless and innocent in here really and it fits nicely that there are two girls at the center of the story here, one young and the other very young. So they are the human protagonists. Then there are also of course the fantastic (in the sense of fantasy) protagonists. Early on we have a bit of an introduction to the house and scenery that does not feature the title character yet, but instead shows us tiny little cute black round creatures. Also ghosts or spirits, but definitely not in a malicious way. One character described them as something along the lines of creatures where as long as you smile at them, there is nothing to worry about. But i am sure that even if you don't, there isn't. Just smile more :)<br/><br/>Now then there is of course Totoro, who has a really deep voice when we hear him on one or two occasions. Actually there are like three Totoros you could even say, the big one at the center who is apparently Ghibli's equivalent to the Lorax as we find out he is the protector of the forest, but also the two smaller ones (the smallest one being white, but no explanation why), who are seen first by the very young character and they lead her (not entirely intentional) to the big one. But it is alright. They make friends quickly. When she followed them down there, it almost felt like Alice following the white rabbit. The sleeping moment fits as well. This was by the way also one reference that showed me how harmonic everything in this world is. When the tiny girl mentions how she met Totoro, neither her sister nor her father say something like ""oh don't be stupid it was just a dream and you dreamt of him because you saw him in the book earlier that day"" No, they completely believe her and also do not just act this way. The other girl says or writes in her diary or so that she really wants to meet Totoro too and soon it happens. By the way, you can see Totoro here on the imdb photo on the right obviously. He looks like an XXL version of a mix between cat, owl and mouse somehow. Very interesting creation. Anyway, back to what I said before, namely the scene in the rain. That was a really funny scene, actually the one when the older girls run into Totoro for the very first time. And how she really tries so hard to not look at him, although she is genuinely curious, definitely also a bit anxious, is hilariously awkward to watch. Also what follows with the umbrella and the huge amount of rain pouring down after Totoro stomps on the ground. Maybe the best scene of the movie. But there are others, also smaller less significant scenes. I think Studio Ghibli always manages so well to show authentic kids behavior. Disney does not always manage this well. Let me mention just two examples. The first moment would be right at the very start when we have the kids in the car and they mistake a mailman for a police officer and they hide although they obviously have done nothing wrong, but it is what kids do because police officers have the power to punish people. And then seeing it is a mailman, they wave at him and he waves back. very sweet beginning. The second scene would be the one when we have the small girl play outside the house and she says it is already lunch time or so and then the father says it is still pretty early for that and then there is a moment of silence and briefly the girl just shows up at the table where the father is working and brings him some flowers she collected. This felt so real. It's just very difficult to describe why. You have to watch it.<br/><br/>For drama purposes, but nothing too serious, there is the sick mother. We don't find out what she has exactly., but she needs to stay at the hospital for a long time apparently and when she has a cold near the end, the girls are worried she might be dying. Also kids' fantasy and exaggeration, this time in a bad way. The small girl runs to the hospital then and goes missing (honestly she was such a whirlwind that I wondered why it took so long till they lost track of her) and there is another dramatic moment when they find a small sandal in the water indicating maybe she could have drowned, but of course she hasn't and she is fine and is found again and in the end the two girls take a look at their parents inside the hospital and they see everything is alright. They got there by the way with the help of their new friend Totoro actually or I should say thanks to this cat bus (you know what I mean when you see it) and it was really hilarious when we heard ""Next Stop: Little Sister"" and also afterwards ""Next Stop: Hospital"". Even if the cat bus looked so weird that it also could have been an antagonist if they had wanted it like that. Then again, the tiny girl also has a moment here and there when she looks slightly evil, even if this is not meant to be. Or when the three are having a bath together and the dad starts laughing to basically laugh the scare away, he felt so evil to me. Haha maybe just my perception. More cute kids moments and references by the way include the younger girl and how she keeps saying she is not scared and tries to act all grown-up at times, but sleeping and cuddling with her mother is a completely different story. Of course they clearly miss her. Okay I think this would be all then. Overall definitely an enjoyable watch. Visual side is as convincing as always for Studio Ghibli, nothing to criticize here. Soundtrack did not blow me away this time really, but it is still fine. I don't think this is my favorite Ghibli/Miyazaki work, but this is just because some of the other stuff they/he made is so amazing and definitely not because this one here is bad or anything. It's a good film. No hesitation for me in giving it a thumbs-up and positive recommendation. Go see it if you haven't already unless you hate anime. Still if you do, then this could be a film that breaks the spell for you to open up."

It's a cute movie and it was interesting to think that it was made so long ago a look a little bit at how they depicted Japan in 1988, but I don't find that it was a memorable film at all. It moves along so slowly and doesn't really have any climax at all. I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters. I certainly wouldn't recommend this film to anybody. It is not interesting for me as an adult and I have a hard time believe that it would be captivating to modern children."

","I first saw this before Disney got their hands on the rights, and re-did the English dubs.<br/><br/>Not to knock the Fanning sisters, but Disney ruined this title for me. After having the original DVD which was cracked, and replaced by the Disney re-master my family and I both felt it went waaay down in points.<br/><br/>The original voice-overs, and dialog were magical! The remake changed a few things, and lost loads of emotion. Still a great movie; however, for us we found an original on ebay for some ridiculous amount like $60 USD, and bought it. Never looked back. Totoro is like a family member. We couldn't just leave him behind. Lol.<br/><br/>__ Great movie. I give the original an 8.5 out of 10...

Harsh, but true.<br/><br/>!"
"tommystans","10","1","3","13 May 2014"," One of the best animated films of all times
","I've heard so much about this film for years but never had the time too. However I bought myself the DVD, along with a Blu-Ray version of 'Howl's Moving Castle', another of Miyazaki's great work. And with its fantastic storytelling and 2D animation I was fascinated by its work. The characters are memorable, the music brings out some emotion and the story was nice and simple and is not like the many kids films were it needs to have a hero, a villain etc. it's just a story of two little girls who have an imagination of a bear character known as Totoro. As kids films do have a message, like most of the director's great work, it's hard to underly what the message is of the film, most idiots may 'think' that Totoro is the symbol of death, when really he isn't as the mother in the hospital was OK, look at the end credits, and that the shoe that was found in the pond was not Mei's at all. To me I think there is no message, it's just a fun film to escape the depths of reality. <br/><br/>As of the voice acting for the US audience I prefer the Disney version. I never grew up with the Fox one but I've seen it and the voice acting is just stiff, loud and awful, I'm sorry if I've offended fans of the 1993 dub, but not everyone is a nostalgic hipster and are not blinded by the rose coloured glasses of nostalgia. The Disney's version, before anyone asks Disney is the distributor and dubbing work of the Ghibli films for the English audience. The latter version is better as the voice actors were better. Their voices are more relaxed, realistic and great, especially the fanning sisters. <br/><br/>I think Totoro is one of the greatest animated films of all time and probably one of the greatest movies of all time. It's a very inspiring piece of work that it fuels up my dream of becoming an animator and writer. If you have the chance to see the movie with your kids or if you're a big Miayzaki or Studio Ghibli fan I recommend buying this DVD."
"Reverie5","9","1","3","19 June 2013"," Lovely
","Definitely liked this one, especially Mei, such an adorable bundle of joy (reminds me of my niece). I'm on a mission to watch all of Miyazaki's works, and he has yet to disappoint. So far I've seen Spirited Away and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (skipped Castle in the Sky, that will be next). Definitely not my average film where I have to think about all the themes in the movie. I'm always having to look them up because I don't actively analyze what each character/scene represents. I enjoy how Miyazaki makes me think about what each film of his represents.<br/><br/>I watched it with English dub (starring the Fanning sisters) and it was superb. They really made their characters to life. Enjoyed hearing Superman's voice as well (Tim Daly as Tatsuo). Was a little upset at first because I wanted to watch it in the original Japanese dub, but I watched it with my sister and she doesn't do subtitles. Time to watch it again."
"patryk-czekaj","8","1","3","5 June 2012"," A thing of beauty
","This is definitely one of those astonishingly high-spirited movies that you can simply sit back and enjoy, mainly due to the heart-warming tale and beautiful animations. Hayao Miyazaki did an amazing job, delivering one of the prettiest pictures that any kid or grown-up can love right from the start. One might even say that it is better than classic Disney pictures.<br/><br/>It doesn't provide a strong and elaborate storyline, like Princess Mononoke or Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, and doesn't imply any moral guidance or specific messages. And that's a very good sign, noting that the movie is supposed to bring out all the positive emotions in the viewer through its magical aura and all those enormously joyful characters and creatures appearing on-screen.<br/><br/>Looking at the two young girls, Mei and Satsuki, jumping freely and laughing about no particular things made me want to be a child again. Miyazaki is able to move our minds and make us see that childhood is the most fantastic time of our lives, and being able to use the full potential of one's imagination should be glorified.<br/><br/>Even though it has an element of sadness, with the girls' mom staying in the hospital, it is so neatly placed in the storyline that it doesn't spoil the tremendous fun of watching My Neighbor Totoro. <br/><br/>It's simply an idyllic tale, accompanied by a taste of magic and fantasy. Tell me, who won't be able to adore those fluffy Totoros and their marvelous abilities? Every time they appeared I wanted them to stay a little longer and mesmerize me with their sparkling glow of glee.<br/><br/>The English dubbing is very decent, the voices were chosen appropriately so that they would seem like they were taken straight out of the Japanese version.<br/><br/>All in all, I must say that My Neighbor Totoro really tickled my dreams of being a child all over again with its hypnotizing beauty. It was able to show me yet again that the fantastic world of Japanese anime genre has so many wonderful pictures to offer. And if you really want to start your adventure with Miyazaki, I bet that watching this picture will be the best possible way to do so."

","I'd firstly like to say that I am a HUGE fan of the movies created by Studio Ghibli; they are unlike anything else and this is the case for all of the right reasons.<br/><br/>However, I was somewhat disappointed with ""My Neighbour Totoro"" as, although the charm and imagination of Ghibli productions is there, the actual story-telling techniques seem inadequate for such a great studio. <br/><br/>In terms of the positives of this movie, it has the cute, crazy, original and adventurous style that fans of Japanese anime and especially Studio Ghibli will know and love. In addition to this, the story is one that will probably put a smile on your face at various points. Furthermore, the characters are, for the majority of the movie's run-time, very likable.<br/><br/>However, whilst the style that Ghibli is famous for makes this film a good one, the actual film-making is just not up to the same standard as some of Hayao Miyazaki's other productions, such as Spirited Away and The Castle of Cagliostro. Firstly, some of the characters are introduced in a manner suggestive of a depth to them, however this complexity is never really provided in some cases. We are, essentially, made to want to know more about some characters (their motives, origins, thoughts), however this thirst for knowledge is not entirely satisfied. This limited feel to the movie is furthered by the fact that the whole plot seems slightly too trivial and lacks a driving purpose. Finally, considering the fact that the run-time is around 80minutes, the pacing is quite peculiar, which left, me personally, wanting more to happen quickly, however this desire is never really met.<br/><br/>Overall, this is, undoubtedly, a very good film, and worth a watch for any fans of Japanese anime. However, underneath the wonderful style, originality and creativity Studio Ghibli invoke, is a fairly shallow production that relies far more on its charm as opposed to its production values."

","I love this movie. Miyazaki can do a movie like no other and his magic shows in any movie. I started noticing the influence WW2 had on film makes like this and I think this movie captures it in a fun childish way that does not loose it power. The character design was amazing from the girls to all of the creatures. I think that Miyazaki can pull off taking a pretty empty shot and using to keep the pace of the movie without it being obvious, but then it picks up and it just turns into a whirlwind of magic. The tragic nature of a lot of Japanese film and the way of coping with it by creating a fantastical world where dreams literally come true. I think one of the nice things at the end of the movie that no one including the parents and the audience don't believe in the magic that propels the movie. At times it is a little scary, but in a good way, but nothing horrible every really happens. The only reason this movie does not get a 10 is because when watching any Miyazaki film one inevitably compares it to his other films and I do not think this top spirited away, but has a place in every movie library."
"MichelleATX","9","1","3","13 August 2007"," Kids can't get enough of this one
","We've gotten our two boys, ages 2 and 1, a lot of Miyazaki's anime. Some of them didn't even come with English tracks or subtitles, but that hasn't stopped our kids from clamoring to see them again and again. Sometimes in the same day. While they both like Howl's Moving Castle, The Cat Returns, and Spirited Away, this is their favorite, by far. They hear the theme start and they squeal with delight. Until we got the English-dub, they were starting to sing the theme song in Japanese.<br/><br/>The story is easy to follow, the characters are easy for kids to identify with, and the Totoros are just delightful. The only downside of this movie, in my opinion, is that the English musical soundtrack doesn't have Sonya Isaac's ""Hey Let's Go!,"" which is our favorite song in the film. I haven't found this song yet as an audio file and I know my kids would get a kick out of hearing it in the car.<br/><br/>Can't recommend this movie highly enough. I've easily seen it over 100 times and still haven't tired of it myself."

I read a lot about Grave of the Fireflies and upon watching it, made me feel human again. I heard about Tonari no Totoro around the same time I heard of Grave of the Fireflies, however I did not have the money to obtain Tonari no Totoro.<br/><br/>I had the chance to watch this film and loved it when I watched it. Basically the film is about a family, two sisters and their father who move into a new house. The sisters see this spirit who takes them throughout the forest and other parts of the land.<br/><br/>The story is well told and the animation is top notch.<br/><br/>If you like cute stories like this, then watch this film.."
"GSmith9072","10","1","3","5 June 2007"," There should be more films like this
","So simple, so poetic. Two young girls move to the country and discover to helpful furry friends. ""My Neighbor Tortoro"" is a celebration of childhood and imagination and the film is executed brilliantly. The plot is the least of the film's worries. It just goes with the flow, and yet it's fully allowed to. The major conflict in the film doesn't arrive until past the middle, but its odd narrative is more of its subtle beauty. Without to much apparent conflict, we're invited to watch the flashes of fish in the river and uncover odd critters that live in the attic. And so, the magic in the film subtly blends with childhood discovery. There's tadpoles in a puddle, and cute little critters that disappear when chased. There's a big critter with an inviting stomach. The hand painted fluid and organic animation is beyond gorgeous and very appropriate for the earthy flair to this film. Speaking of earth, I find films like these to be the best advocates of environmental protection. We're not padded over the head with anything, but the image of a bottle in a clear lake leaves a strong impact to all viewers. That of course is just another side theme in the film, the importance of nature, and more importantly, it's a non-objectable message. It breaths for me like a painting, and yet the atmosphere is so relaxing and engaging. I don't hesitate to accept the world the little girls create/experience. The messages are those that everyone can relate to. I never grew up Japan (or found any magical creatures that I can remember), but I could certainly identify with the film's two main characters. And if you didn't have a great childhood, sit back and enjoy the adventures of the two eager little girls in this wonderful little film that's also a landmark in animation."
"KatNut","10","1","3","1 April 2007"," Refreshingly magical without being over-the-top
","I first watched My Neighbor Totoro when I was around six or seven, and it remains to be in my top 3 favorite childhood movies. Even today, as a college student, I can watch it and shamelessly laugh and giggle along with Mei and Satsuki.<br/><br/>The movie is set in a Japanese farming province around the early 1950's, without all the depressing post-war images and allusions that other movies set in this time make. Satsuki (10), Mei (around 5), and their father, a University Professor, have moved there seemingly to make life easier for their hospitalized mother, who is recovering from some undisclosed illness. There, Mei finds Totoro, a forest spirit who lives in the forest around their house.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the best thing about this movie's staying power is that it can be viewed anywhere, by anyone, of any age, and there's nothing uncomfortable or over-cheesy about it. Also, it leaves lasting memories for anyone and, after watching it, gives you a light-hearted and innocent sense of hope.<br/><br/>I highly suggest this movie; the 1993 version more so than the ""remastered"" 2005 version. It's more fun for children and a bit more whimsical over-all. I give the 1993 version a 10 and the 2005 version a 9."

"johnnyboyz","6","1","4","20 March 2013"," Not especially interesting, but it carries with it a positive ethic even if it's little more than an animated aside.
","My Neighbour Totoro is a sweet, pleasing little romp; an animation with some colourful landscapes and sweet, likable child leads whose frolicking and sheer bounce are often the engine room to the film's otherwise empty sense of energy. Sadly, and for all its plaudits, the film comes off as ultimately a bit of an inconsequence - it isn't exciting, nor particularly memorable: there is little conflict; little drama and the film is extraordinarily light on narrative and character. If I told you the film was about a child encountering monsters given these things, you might raise an eyebrow. However, if I told you the monsters, instead of being scary, were themselves scared of an energetic, boisterous human presence then you might be able to put two-and-two together in that the animation is less interested in delivering the generic thrills and spills that come with such a premise and more interested in exploration and revisionism. That's fine, of course; but when the charm of such an idea has worn off and the approach to have it both ways in its grounded depiction of a dramatic reality (alá Ocean Waves or Only Yesterday) mixed with fruiter, more escapist Ghibli fare driven by encounters with odd animals, we are not left with much in which to get interested nor with which to stay invested.<br/><br/>At its heart is a tale of a young child meeting creatures not of this world, but the creatures are more interested in catching up on sleep than anything else. They meet, hang out, learn to be in one another's presence, get along fine and that's the end of it. This is, of course, only to a face value; look deeper and you'll see that this is a film about a child being brave in the face of new surroundings; of learning how to act in the company of strangers; of accepting predicaments and, it seems, coming to quite enjoy eating one's vegetables.<br/><br/>Two playful young sisters named Satsuki and Mei are in the process of moving into a new home with their father in decades-ago Japan, an abode in the country; secluded and rural. Their existence is happy, jovial; they are easily excited and very enthusiastic in their nature. Upon arrival, there are some relatively uninteresting frolicking around; the kids get wind of would-be real/unreal creatures that already occupy the premises: little grey sprites that live in the walls and dart about when no one's looking out of fear of the fresh human occupants. This allows the film to play with a child's fear of the dark; their gradual discomfort of being in a new space and the sense of excitement abound with all these things combined as exploration beckons, and we're never sure if horror or soft-core adventure is the order of the day here. It's both – on occasion not either. Whatever the choice, rarely does the film feel like it's going anywhere or with the aspiration to truly take off.<br/><br/>The kids lack a mother. She rears up out of the blue later on, in an ill-advised manner when it's revealed she's suffering from depression. It's here the issues with the overall approach to My Neighbour Totoro rear up, since it was never that sort of film in the first place, and I find it difficult not to resent the piece for dragging us down that path when the whole subplot arrives. At the core of it lies a friendship Mei strikes up with the titular Totoro, her ""neighbour"" as it were, in that he lives nearby just beyond the bushes and undergrowth of the gardens. Totoro is an animal not of this world; a sort of egg shaped creature who looks a little like a rabbit but is about as big as a small tree He sleeps. He sleeps a lot. He says very little, and is enormous, but appears friendly in spite of the fact he could fit all of Mei inside of his mouth.<br/><br/>Where he is docile, she is this continuous presence of excitement and activity but the film cannot muster up much excitement or interest when these two of such a binary opposition come together. In spite of the character's inherent lack of anything at all that may be interesting, it hasn't stopped the companies shipping millions of Totoro die-cast toys; this is in spite of him essentially being someone so uncharacteristic, and so dull in their existence, that I'm hard pressed not to say they are the most lifeless, least likable Ghibli character I can think who's of a supernatural sort. Totoro has his obligatory access to all sorts of magic and friends and avenues to adventure, and Mei comes to interact with them. They fly around and plant seeds and everyone has fun. At least, it looked like they did. The film carries on. Everyone's getting along fine; no one believes Mei: of course they don't, although the father finds room to play along with the fantasy. The whole thing is sufficient, innocuous nonsense that's ultimately too childish to explore the darker passages inherent in within it, and too inconsequential to motivate much interest in the central fantasy tract."

","This superbly animated children's tale is directed by Hayao Miyazaki, one of Japan's most beloved animators.This animated fantasy film written and directed by Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli follows the two young daughters of a professor and their interactions with friendly wood spirits in postwar rural Japan.<br/><br/>The story follows Satsuke and Mei, two young girls who find that their new country home is in a mystical forest inhabited by a menagerie of mystical creatures called Totoros. They befriend O Totoro, the biggest and eldest Totoro, who is also the king of the forest. As their girls' mother lies sick in the hospital, O Totoro brings the sisters on a magical adventure but also helps them to understand the realities of life. <br/><br/>Like most films released by Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli, this family- oriented feature has a powerful ecological theme. The English-language version of this film wasn't dubbed until many years later, explaining the presence of actors such as Dakota Fanning in the cast.This is one of the best animated films ever made for families: it celebrates feminine sensitivity, the importance of the spirit world, respect for nature, and the pre-eminence of the spiritual practice of kindness. Overall,Miyazaki's cinematic magic is so enchanting that even a slew of unremarkable extra features won't take the smile off your face and it is a heartwarming, sentimental masterpiece that captures the simple grace of childhood."

We watched it in class because at the time we didn't even know any Japanese words other than ""shinkansen"".  The members of my class immediately skipped ahead in our writing texts to learn how to write ""Totoro"" in hiragana script and made a joke out of it for 3 months, writing it on the boards.

"MeloDee","7","1","16","15 April 2006"," Rather disappointing.
","The movie, although it had some fairly cute moments, had an extremely weak plot. There are no dramatic events within it, and thus, no room or place for the characters to grow. In fact, the movie doesn't even attempt to include those subtle moral themes that are so typical of most children's films- which, contrary to some beliefs can be a very good and important thing when done well.<br/><br/>Instead of being the mysterious and wonderful film it was supposed to be, it seemed rather...bland. Adventures with Totoro seemed very aimless and could've been done a lot more colorfully.<br/><br/>Also, what was up with that gigantic smile (and equally colossal roar) that Totoro had? Instead of being friendly, it appeared rather ominous. In fact it reminded my older siblings and I of the grin of Ghostly from Pokemon.<br/><br/>I'm fairly sure, though, that somebody, somewhere, will be enchanted by this movie despite what I say. Seeing how my 4 year-old sister was enraptured by the film- and seemingly not at all disturbed by Totoro or his cat-shaped bus- I perhaps have the bias that comes with being skeptical and teen aged. I would, however, highly recommend those enchanted-creature-hungry-folk to leave this one and pursue one of Miyazaki's other films, or, Alice and Wonderland.<br/><br/>So, after taking all factors into account, I've decided to be generous and give this movie a 7, whereas personally, it was more like a 6 for me."

","Some of the best anime and animation I've ever seen. it's so wonderful. Hayao Miyazaki is a master storyteller. I think Stephen Spielberg is a master story teller too. What both of these men have in common for me is the ability to touch a nerve when every they tell their story, and they do it constantly even with their bad movies.<br/><br/>But My Neighbor Totoro is not a bad movie. it's a very good movie. One of Miyazaki's best. What I like about it mostly is the animation itself, it just moves so beautifully, like the best animation should. I'm use to the action packed superhero, slapstick kind of animation and despite it's quiet story set in Japan's quiet countryside, the movement of the animation made it so exciting in this anime.<br/><br/>So the movie is about two girls who moved to the country side with their father to be close to their ill mother ( Miyazaki has use the whole movie to the country to handle illness a few time since this movie like in The Wind Rises).

"ccamp89","9","0","1","15 May 2016"," ""I could see them too, when I was young.""
","Everything is magical when you're a child. A gust of wind over a grassy meadow, a giant conifer reaching to the sky, tadpoles swirling in a puddle, a brand new house to run through and explore. Life is new, exciting, and mysterious.<br/><br/>My Neighbor Totoro is a film that perfectly captures the wonder and beauty of life as seen through the eyes of a child. This is Hayao Miyazaki at his most restrained. In the broad scheme of his filmography, it is a distillation of everything that makes his work so effective and beloved: stunningly authentic character animation brimming with personality, gorgeously detailed settings and landscapes, and an ability to capture the magic in the small, inconsequential moments of life. <br/><br/>We follow Satsuki and Mei, two young sisters who have moved with their father to a new house in an idyllic rural village. It is soon revealed that the purpose of this move is to be closer to their chronically ill mother who is staying in a nearby hospital - a detail which gains significant weight with the knowledge that Miyazaki's own mother spent a lot of time in the hospital with tuberculosis when he was a child. Although their mother's illness does loom over the film and is a crucial grounding element, it is relatively distant and far from its focal point. Instead, the meat of the film is simply Satuski and Mei exploring their new home and surroundings, assimilating to life in a new town, and, of course, meeting Totoro and friends. <br/><br/>Totoro and his companions are the ""spirits of the forest"", as the girls' father puts it. He can't see them, nor can any of the adults in the film. For Mei and Satsuki, though, they are very much alive and real. Totoro acts as a personification of the aforementioned magic of nature and life. He's what makes acorns sprout into trees and propels the wind over the plains. Of course Mei and Satsuki can see him - for them, the wonder and awe of life is still fresh and exhilarating. And even though their father may not physically see these creatures as he works by candle light amidst a mess of papers and books, he seems to remember a time when he did. He nurtures the wonderment that his daughters feel and vicariously experiences it through them, as do we.<br/><br/>All Miyzaki films have an environmental theme and display a fond respect for nature; here, it's reverential. Wind rushes over the grassy farmland, butterflies flutter in and out of frame, a snail inches slowly up the stem of a flower, a toad crawls along a dirt road in the middle of a rainstorm, a fish bobs to the surface of a pond setting small ripples in motion which radiate away. Miyazaki hangs over each of these moments and makes it impossible not to experience their simple beauty as the girls do.<br/><br/>This is the essence of My Neighbor Totoro. It's a simple, humble, and reflective film free of sensory excess, antagonists, or even a traditional plot. It merely sets out to magnify and bask in the magic of life which becomes all too muted as you age. ""I could see them too, when I was young"", states a warm, elderly neighbor of the girls. With this film, you might yet again."

"sharky_55","10","0","1","22 September 2015"," Simply enchanting
","The original Japanese audio is imperative to My Neighbour Totoro and I highly recommended it. Not that the English dub isn't sufficient (Ghibli films tend to attract a certain amount of care), but it doesn't do justice the lovely representation of childhood and innocence that the master Miyazaki conjures here. The sisters Satsuki and Mei discover these dust bunnies, little black fluffballs with tiny legs and eyes (this design later revisited in Spirited Away), and they may exist or not, but the adults in their father and Granny certainly indulge them. They delight in this discovery of their 'haunted' house and scream out shrilly and cackle for the bunnies in a way that only the original Japanese can fully justify. And in the animation their eyes grow wide and their grins grow massive - even more massive than say, the arguing men in Castle in the Sky, and that is truly a mark of great emotion when considering Miyazaki's work. That is again revisited in the bathing scene amidst a harrowing storm, where the father ushers in this silliness and over the top laughter to scare away the evil spirits. He's a thoughtful and caring and accommodating character like so few fathers in fiction are today - he isn't the problem, but his career and absence merely a symptom of life. Hisaishi's lovely track ""Obake Yashiki"" (or Haunted House) aids this discovery process; the eager plucks of the synthesizer create such a nervous excitement and curiosity that Satsuki and Mei clutch with their hands and eagerly embrace. I am reminded of this same track being used in this Chinese cartoon from my childhood, about a similarly gigantic tree amongst small trees in peaceful serene forest, until loggers arrive. <br/><br/>But within those moments of pure delight in their childhood there is a significant blemish, their mother's illness which continually keeps her in hospital. The film does not focus on her plight as some sort of impending doom, but rather its implications and effects on the rest of the family. It is simply a fact of life. And so Satsuki has been forced into a role older than her years, a motherly comfort for Mei when she sulks and cries. She is, because of the unfortunate circumstances, pushed into the brink of adulthood. So it is the singular Mei who discovers the Totoro creatures, in a very delightful sequence where the white bunny-like one nervously rushes ahead and out of her eager palms. When she indignantly claims that she is not lying about her encounter (after the hilarious incident with the bushes), the adults nod in agreement after initially laughing at her. But Satsuki is also swept up in these tales, because even for her remarkably maturity, she collapses from things asked of her that are beyond what a little girl should be forced to face. And so we have two girls who are devoid of parental attention, and in this they find comfort and serenity in Totoro's adventures, playfully imitating Hisaishi's title theme with recorders atop the gigantic mystical tree.<br/><br/>My favourite segment has to be the middle part where the two sisters go to the bus-stop with an umbrella for their father. Miyazaki lets us experience the rain and cold and impatience they feel, but it isn't sinister for no good reason. The giant Totoro joins them, and without a second thought Satsuki offers her the black umbrella, leading to the iconic and strange composition of the pair waiting in the rain for a bus, each with their own way of brandishing the umbrella. And sound design is used so weirdly and wonderful to establish Totoro as a gentle and mysterious giant; the heavy drop of rain that splatters against the umbrella, coupled with the adorable animation of the hairs standing up to attention and the wide lopsided grin. That grin is later copied by perhaps the strangest creature of them all, the cat-bus, with its multiple rapid legs and its pair of rats illuminating its destination. When its door magically widens, we hear a peculiar metallic sound effect, the only ones apart from the sisters to witness this. The magical friendship here is strengthened, though we are still somewhat baffled and amazed. <br/><br/>My Neighbour Totoro is an extremely poignant and magical and strange exploration of the sort of childhood curiosity and imagination that children, but in particularly these two, can conjure. They play their recorders atop the giant tree, but it vanishes in the morning. Do they weep and moan? No, they rejoice and dance, imitating the same movements from last night to urge the little seedlings to burst forth once again. It's not the sort of tale that is ramped up to the extremities to promote some internal change - we get an inkling that is already happening with Satsuki, but it's not something that she is entirely ready to handle. And that's okay. Are these forest spirits a coping mechanism, or a fantastic comfort in a world that's a little scarier each time the sisters are told that their mother will not return home quite yet? Many films would have the children approach from a distance, cautious and apprehensive. The father, upon hearing of such a creature, would cynically berate such lies and establish himself as a sort of antagonist, but more importantly as an adult. Miyazaki makes the children squeal in delight and chase after such creatures. The father beats his chest in the most absurd way and cackles madly with his daughters. And later a weeping Satsuki collapses into the chest of Totoro, clearly overwhelmed by the burdens thrust upon her. She finds comfort and assistance. Everything will be okay."

"DarthBober","10","0","1","22 February 2015"," Sometimes You Have to Laugh for Problems to Go Away
","""There are dark dust bunnies all over the top floor!"" ""Just laugh, they are scared of us laughing."" —Mei and an old lady, My Neighbor Totoro<br/><br/>There are a lot of amazing movies that address a variety of different topics. Some, like American Sniper, talk about patriotism; some, like Now You See Me, question the perception of reality. These movies may be entertaining and great to watch; however, they will never be good enough to remain in memory of an audience for decades. Only a few, unique movie titles will be able to survive through time and remain in the history of cinematography as unique works of art. What makes these masterpieces so distinct is their ability to point directly to the heart of an audience and make each individual question his or her life rather than philosophically think about the world. My Neighbor Totoro could definitely be considered as one of these masterpieces. The movie's uniqueness lies in the ability to make adults feel young again; this allows My Neighbor Totoro to treat the audience of all ages in the same way. Hayao Miyazaki desired his work to convey the importance of fighting one's fears and helping each other. These lessons are equally important for children as well as adults. <br/><br/>From the very beginning the movie grabs the audience's attention by the relations between two girls. Film critique Roger Ebert writes:""...it would never have won its worldwide audience just because of its warm heart. It is also rich with human comedy in the way it observes the two remarkably convincing, lifelike little girls"" (2). These sisters show us an absolutely selfless love that is not based on any material benefit. They seem to be two perfect children that play with each other outside and do not care about any of the troubles of an outside world. Mei and Satsuki support each other despite everything and, above all, they never question each other's loyalty. Such a good pair of heroes makes every adult think about his or her childhood. As the author of article from EmpireOnline states, ""Totoro's an out-and-out joy to watch, a subtle, atmospheric slice of childhood, perfectly capturing the naivety, the delight, and the mystery that is part of being a child"" (60). The movie reminds an older audience of times when they were young. There were no responsibilities, all the friendships seemed eternal, and there was no reason to worry about anything other than boogeyman in the closet or health of loved ones. For the vast majority of an older audience the movie brings these vivid images back and lets them feel young again despite the fact that they most likely are already having children with whom they are watching this movie. The major topic of My Neighbor Totoro is fears and the ways to fight them. It seems to be traceable throughout the entire movie. Whether it is the fear of darkness and evil spirits or the fear for the parents, My Neighbor Totoro exposes it and shows that it may not be that scary after all. As the girls move into the haunted house, the only way to get rid of evil spirits is simply to laugh. This may sound weird and strange at the first thought; however, surprisingly, something as simple as laughing does indeed do a great job in getting rid of fears. Moreover, the elder audience may see this as a metaphor in a way. It is almost as if Miyazaki himself tries to tell us that the best way to approach the problems is to face them head on and not to be afraid of anything. This is especially seen when the girls find out that their mother will not come back home on the weekend; they got afraid for her health. Everyone who was at the point of knowing that his or her loved ones are in danger has experienced such an awful feeling. The scene shows that it is normal to be afraid for someone's health. Moreover, the movie shows the audience that they are not the only ones out there and there is always someone who would be willing to help. Totoro symbolizes this selfless friendship and empathy that people need when they face the challenges. As a movie reviewer White denotes about My Neighbor Totoro, ""It doesn't use denial as a blanket. It presents a real world scary scenario, with the comfort being imagination and magic. We can get through anything with the right friend"". In addition, there is a large emphasis on not giving up and fighting the fears or problems despite everything. This is the reason why Mei decided to run and visit her mother on her own. Had she not done this, there would have been no reason for Totoro to come and help her. Through this Hayao Miyazaki teaches the audience that problems and fears may not be that easy to overcome; however, there is always a need to fight. <br/><br/>My Neighbor Totoro is a unique work of art not only due to the fact that it addresses inner problems of the audience but also because it unifies the audience of all ages. It shows us that despite the age, we may not be different after all and adults may learn from kids as much as children may learn from adults around them. Of course, there have been other movies that addressed the exact same topic and even attempted to relate to the audience in the way My Neighbor Totoro did; however, they lack that unique feeling of childhood in them, the one that makes us want to watch Miyazaki's masterpiece over and over again and attempt to learn more from it."
"ThomasDrufke","7","0","1","18 February 2015"," Untapped Imagination
","I think everyone can enjoy a good family film every once in awhile, especially when it's directed by the genius Hayao Miyazaki. He always finds the right mix of fantastical imagination with real heartwarming material. While I think My Neighbor Totoro is a good film, it's nowhere near his best. It explores the relationship between big and little sister, but also people dealing with a difficult situation in life. And sometimes that's when your imagination is at it's highest.<br/><br/>It starts off pretty slow, and we don't actually get to see Totoro for about 20 minutes, but when we do the film takes a big jump in quality. A child's imagination is something that is only understood if you have had the same imagination at some point in your life. I remember the days of pretending I had other friends and creatures who would join me on my own adventures. So I can definitely relate to Mei and Satsuki. I think a better film for this would probably be Spirited Away, but it's nonetheless an enjoyable ride. The last 15 minutes or so are really touching. I loved all of the family moments, including their forest family.<br/><br/>So Miyazaki has another heartwarming animated feature to his repertoire, but it falls short of the greatness of Spirited Away or even Howl's Moving Castle.<br/><br/>+Touching <br/><br/>+Imaginative <br/><br/>+Totoro is so welcoming <br/><br/>-Slow start <br/><br/>-Could have been even more fantastical <br/><br/>7.0/10"

As their girls' mother lies sick in the hospital, O Totoro brings the sisters on a magical adventure but also helps them to understand the realities of life. <br/><br/>My Neighbor Totoro (or Tonari no Totoro ) is a anime film with: No scary monsters, no villains, no evil adults and not like the other three act structure, and that could surprise a lot of people who are expecting the same third act in animated movie. This movie was beyond loved for being the best animated film ever made and that's from die hard fans of Hayao Miyazaki and moviegoers everywhere, and I can see easily see why, because this movie in opinion is one of the most griping, beautiful and the most stunning anime that actually give me butterflies deep inside of movie, and that's rare for me.<br/><br/>This may sound over the top or over doing it but I don't Hayao Miyazaki is a god of anime and storytelling to the big screen. I only seen some of Miyzaki films but after watching spirited Away and this movie I want to more of this guys work, I found out that Hayao Miyazaki last film was The Wind Rises which I need to watch sooner or late, but it's a same to hear that, but the good things must come to a end. <br/><br/>I absolutely loved the animation in this film, I mean how can put it into words without messing up my words. It's better to watch and experience the creative animation standing out from any other animated films, and just let the wonderful character's that are fully of joy and life can easily win you over by the first sentence.<br/><br/>For problems... I don't have any, yeah no problems with this film. I was glued in by the world that Miyazaki created. I was locked in from start till the very end.<br/><br/>Overall My Neighbor Totoro is different and the film doesn't shy away from that, it's a brilliant film and it's more then a kids film even adults can dig this movie."

","I've seen 4 Studio Ghibli films now (This, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke and The Wind Rises) and they are miles ahead of DreamWorks and nearly every other animated studio. Their films are just as visually stunning as the CGI ones and uniquely magical. My Neighbour Totoro is another enchanting film about 2 girls making friends with the forest spirits and having various adventures. MNT is widely regarded as one of the best animated movies ever and it should be. It's not as good as the other Ghibli films I've seen. It's very short and there's not that much of a plot. Therefore, it feels slighter and briefer than the others. There is a slight lack of structure. Those shortcomings demote it from a five star movie to a four star one, but there's plenty to love about this movie. The visuals are great and there is a real sense of wonder and amazement. It's colourful, dazzling and the anime looks just as realistic as Pixar's animation does. Hayao Miyazaki is pretty much the current ruler of animation, and only Walt Disney can rival him in the animated world.<br/><br/>MNT is a very soulful and sweet movie that feels genuinely magical and enchanting. Various scenes such as the bus stop and the cat bus are awe inspiring and wondrous, and the script has plenty of sentiment but feels genuine and charming. This is a film where only the most cynical and hardened film viewers will dislike it, as the film has likability and charm in spades. This children's film lacks what many children's films are sorely lacking: A sense of innocence and elegance. It may not be the best movie by Studio Ghibli but it has some of the most memorable moments from their filmography and some of their best images. The forest spirits are beautifully designed and there's good reason why a Totoro toy appears in Toy Story 3. This is a more relaxed picture from Miyazaki and while his other movies have their frightening bits this is pretty much devoid of them. A delightful animated movie with plenty of sparkle and dazzle. Younger audiences will be enthralled, but it'll speak to adults as well.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Extraordinary animation of Hayao Miyazaki. Among other adjectives accompanied by timely exclamation points can list: magic, tender, deep, fun, painful, contagious, provocative, beautiful ... <br/><br/>It is amazing how in Tororo are even more evident the unique qualities that only genius artists can achieve. Here the magic is deeply linked to the forces of nature, and everything that fascinates can also at the same time scare. <br/><br/>Besides the unique look (in its simplicity) and intense charisma (especially the Tororo own and younger sister Mei), the Ghibli studios once again touch on complex issues like loss and accountability, without sacrificing poetry, and especially unrestrained imagination. <br/><br/>For those who coast cartoons, and art in general, we have a legitimate representative of a flawless and unforgettable work."

I certainly smiled at several points of the film while they adapt country side life because the characters are adorable and I absolutely loved the yōkais created by the director especially Totoro and Susuwatari. You have no idea how much I loved supernatural and mythical creatures, fictional or not ♥<br/><br/>On the other hand, if I am to choose the best 1980s animated feature film from Studio Ghibli, I would certainly go for the lesser known film Grave of the Fireflies (1988) though. This is because of its powerful impact and I also liked Setsuko more than Mei.

","Similar to ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" (2001) in premise and ""El espíritu de la colmena"" (1973) in its depiction of childhood imagination, Miyazaki's ""Tonari no Totoro"" (1988) succeeds in blending the Japanese folklore and warm childhood summer nostalgia, the unattainable freedom of youthful imagination and hope, and the fear of not only growing up but becoming overwhelmed by the worldly sorrows of the grown-ups.<br/><br/>Full of the small, beautiful moments of family life: the bath, the bicycle ride (the dad resting in the grass while the girls eat), the possibility of the mother's death frames a deeply moving story of two children at a loss as to how to cope with the illness and absence of their mother. And they've also just moved house, as Sen had before going through the tunnel, which in this film leads further into the forest, to the magnificent Caphor tree.<br/><br/>A great deal is made of that which exists but cannot be seen by the adults. The Susuwatari, the rustle of wind that in fact is something much more than mere wind, the rain that hides more on the darkening nightly road than an ordinary bus, the planted seeds that magically grow overnight; all this leads to the final emotional resolve, where the girls deliver an ear of corn on the windowsill of their mother's hospital room. In a sense, the whole film is all about this trip the children make, where the film tries to convince us that in that ear of corn not everything is as it seems."

","This is the third Miyazaki film I've seen and it's the first family anime to make me feel like a child again. I didn't see it as a kid, I just recently watched it and yet it still took me away into a world of great imagination and adventure. Most family films don't do that to me as an adult (mostly films I never grew up with such as this.) The dubbing isn't all that bad but it's not spectacular ether. What's important is how well the premise and the characters and the moral (I don't think this even has a moral but it doesn't need one, in my opinion. It can be just a whimsical imaginative fantasy like Alice in Wonderland) is written and it's all written very well. I still find it hard to believe how well the animation is, considering the fact that it's a late 80's film. Topnotch animation. Give it a world."

","Magically capturing the beauty & innocence of childhood, My Neighbor Totoro is a magnificent example of hand-drawn animation from Studio Ghibli. Set in a rural village in post-war Japan, it tells the story of two little girls who move to a new place with their father so that they can be near to the hospital where their mother is recovering from a long-term illness and covers the little girls' adventures with the wood spirits living in a nearby forest.<br/><br/>Directed by world's renowned artist Hayao Miyazaki, My Neighbor Totoro isn't any conflicted or tragic story but is simply a reflection & celebration of life & its little adventures. The childhood of the two girls portrayed here is extremely convincing, the fanciful creatures including Totoro are freshly imagined, the 2D animation mirrors a beautiful painting, the voice actors are lively in their roles & the music is as heartwarming as it is soothing.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, My Neighbor Totoro is a nostalgic journey of childhood, an adventure for all ages & a subtle commentary about the depleting relationship between humans & nature. It brings on screen some wondrous creatures of fantasy & yet remains grounded throughout its runtime.

","""Tonari no Totoro"", also called ""My Neighbor Totoro"" in English, is a family-oriented anime feature made in 1988 by Hayao Miyazaki and his own-founded company Studio Ghibli.<br/><br/>Basic plot: When Satsuki and her little sister Mei move into a country house together with their father (so they get to be closer to their sick mother who's in a hospital), they get to be friends with various creatures and a forest keeper called Totoro. So the sisters get to experience a great adventure together.<br/><br/>For several years ago, I first saw this on a Norwegian DVD I rented at the library where I'm working. And this made me want to watch more movies made by director Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, including ""Howl's Moving Castle"", ""Spirited Away"" and ""Ponyo"".<br/><br/>When I first saw this flick, I found the animation and the drawings to be wonderful, and the story to be pretty good for an animated feature made for the general audience. To be more right, I just enjoy the animation style Studio Ghibli is giving us the audience. This studio just seems to know how to put elements like humor, suspense and dramatic into their works, and how to make a good family-friendly story as ""Totoro"" has.<br/><br/>For the content itself, the most comical scene all together has to be the rainy scene where Satsuki offers Totoro her umbrella, and Totoro seems to get delighted by the raindrops falling on the umbrella.<br/><br/>It is also interesting to see that the film's titular character Totoro is also used as the mascot for the company itself, hence this character being a part of the Studio Ghibli logo.<br/><br/>The Malay box set called ""Studio Ghibli Movies Collection"", which I have as bought through eBay, includes 17 nicely done animated movies and a concert special, with ""My Neighbor Totoro"" as one of them.<br/><br/>At the end, I recommend this for any family around the world.

","A gorgeous, pitch-perfect example of Studio Ghibli's wonderful trademarked style. Bubbling over with awe, wonder, curiosity and optimism, it's downright impossible not to get sucked into viewing and enjoying this through the eyes of its two young protagonists, recognizing forgotten flashes of our own youth at several steps along the way. The plot isn't particularly deep or elaborate, but in many ways I can see that as a positive - why force drama into a scenario that's working perfectly well as a quiet, leisurely stroll down imagination lane? I was actually relieved when it became clear they weren't even thinking of moving in that direction. Even the more reflective moments don't miss a beat, as Miyazaki and company lovingly flush the screen with life in dozens of cheery, unexpected ways. Magnificent animation pairs with a breathtaking setting, a playful spirit, a lovable cast of characters, great timing and a moderate dash of real-life tangibility. Authentic and vivid and pleasant, with at least one foot planted firmly in our world... despite the constant presence of an eight-foot Furby."

","I'm not the world's biggest animation fan, but I always make a point of watching Studio Ghibli movies whenever they're on; something about the creativity of such films appeals and reawakens the child in me. MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is my latest watch from the studio, and while it's not my favourite, it does have plenty to recommend it.<br/><br/>First off, this is a kid's film through and through, like the later PONYO (one of my all-time favourites). Don't go in expecting another GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES, because this is all about magical childhood experiences and a break from the real world, a bit like THE SNOWMAN. Adult themes do intrude on the plot - the mother's illness, for instance - but for the most part this is a simple, straightforward children's adventure film.<br/><br/>However, the film works due to the level of creativity present in the story, and particularly in the two creations thought up for the movie: there's the troll-like Totoro of the title, an intriguing and odd creature, and then there's the crowd-pleasing and lovable Catbus, the highlight of the whole thing.<br/><br/>There's not a great deal of plot or incident, but there's some fine scenes involving kids lost in the forest or flying through the air, and some nicely-judged character work, particularly in the form of the ultra-shy neighbour's child.

","My Neighbor Totoro is Studio Ghibli's crown jewel, and for a reason. No other film captures the innocence and wonder of childhood so perfectly, yet also takes the viewer to an emotional roller-coaster with lovable characters and a magical atmosphere. Totoro will leave anyone with a soul smiling for hours after finishing it.<br/><br/>To count the plot of Totoro is next to pointless, as there hardly is one. Two girls move to a new house with their dad and they meet the forest spirits. That's it. Totoro doesn't exist to tell a story, it exists to spark the wonder and joy of childhood in anyone who's ever lived it. The scenes which the mere thought of can make you smile are almost too many to count: the first encounter with Totoro, the magical flying top ride, the cat bus and so on. Magical is truly the key word here, and the adorability reaches almost unbearable levels.<br/><br/>The visuals have truly stood the test of time. Despite having been released only 2 years after Castle in the Sky and simultaneously with Grave of the Fireflies, the visuals are thoroughly convincing. Backgrounds are detailed and the animation is smooth and realistic. <br/><br/>Butas with any Ghibli film, the true might of Totoro lies in its atmosphere. It captures the innocence of childhood without feeling pandering or idyllic. The characters and places feel real, and not some faraway fantasy land: the kid next door can be mean, buses don't always arrive on time, the characters aren't perfect. Partly this is thanks to the absolutely MARVELOUS Japanese voice cast who bring every character fully to life, the highlight being the two girls for whom we truly feel. When the tension racks up a bit towards the end you will truly feel the desperate confusion they're going through. <br/><br/>One could keep going for hours like this. Totoro is as good as all-ages (and that is truly the case here, don't you dare say otherwise) films can get. That's all I can say.<br/><br/>Recommendation: A must-see for EVERYONE."

","My Neighbor Totoro is in my honest opinion one of the best movies I ever had the chance to see. It's absolutely perfect in every respect: the soundtrack is simple and beautiful, the animation is of excellent quality, with beautiful painting landscapes, the characters are amazingly realistic and is perhaps the ultimate children's movie. It's a flawless diamond of cinema and was rightly included among the 250 greatest movies ever made list by Sign and Sound.<br/><br/>One day I watched this movie together with Citizen Kane and Akira and it easily ""overpowered"" both of these films (in terms of engaging my emotions). It's much more humane and engaging than 99.9% of all other films, animated or otherwise. The film also flows seamlessly and makes you pay attention without any effort, something that most movies have difficulty in attaining (a particularly extreme example would be Citizen Kane).<br/><br/>This movie is considered to be Miyzaki's most personal film, as it reflects his childhood in Japan of the 1950′s. Though I don't really care that much about how personal a film is to a director besides it's effect on the emotions produced by the film. Other Miyazaki films also had a very strong emotional effect without any personal connection with the director, for instance, Kiki's Delivery Service takes place in an alternate history European city and it is about equal to Totoro in my book.<br/><br/>I have argued previously that Miyazaki films (as other Studio Ghibli films) are extremely aggressive. Indeed, this film is like being hit in the head repeatedly by a 10-ton stone made of pure cuteness over a period of 90 minutes: every minute of the film consists of scenes evoking these strong emotions, structured around a simple basic story to minimize noise and we can really fell like the protagonists during the course of the film, it reveals the inner child of anyone.

You must have good imagination to come up with such a story. My favorite of his movies is Howls Moving Castle no doubt but thats just me. If you love anime movies like Miyazaki's then i really recommend it especially if there isn't any good movies on TV. <br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","For somethings in the world you have to free minded,you can't go on reasoning everything you see and everything you watch. People say a person dies two times in his life, once when he is really dead and once when he steps out of his childhood. So if you are given a chance to live up your childhood for some 90 minutes, this movie is for you. Mystical creatures, nature, joy and sadness conquered by happiness are the some childhood reasoning. You wont go on reason everything you see and you have a belief in everything even Santa Claus when you are a kid so why don't relive those great feelings. Speaking for the movie the movie is made with a big heart. The picturesque scenery, the great artwork, the epic storyline, even the soundtrack especially THE PATH OF WIND one of my fav's instrumental. Hayao Miyazaki has created a life out of the movie. Besides it will indulge you in your childhood nostalgia, it will also show how beautiful nature and the villages can be which are reducing at a great rate. Many say this is a movie for kids, some say it's so naive. It is if you watch this movie with your mind full of reasoning. Sometimes do follow your heart and then watch this movie and feel the workmanship the makers have put into it. Concluding movies like this are not made often. A movie for all age groups and for EVERYONE.<br/><br/>Finally, PUT YOUR REASONING ASIDE WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE."

","I was dying to watch this when I first heard of it, and I want to say, I am so glad I did.<br/><br/>I usually give a short plot summary when reviewing but I am afraid to spoil the whole film if I do it this time. It's that good.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and haven't seen My Neighbor Totoro, then do it, immediately.<br/><br/>It is a stroke of genius created by Miyazaki himself, and it makes you want to be with the two girls during their little adventures with the fluffy Totoro themselves.<br/><br/>And the Catbus? One of my favourite animated characters of all time!"
"manendra-lodhi","9","0","2","4 August 2012"," Love and innocence at its best.
","Each film from studio Ghibli has something which cannot be seen normally in other animation films. It's like they treat you in such a gentle way that you cannot hate their films. This film is again a best example of love and innocence at its best. What we have been provided with again is another visual treat of imaginations.<br/><br/>The film has two major characters in the form of cute little girls who are enjoying their days as much as they can. They move to a so called haunted house and their adventures take new turns when they meet little creatures. The little girl is so adorable that you simply cannot take your eyes off her.<br/><br/>Pros: When you will finish watching the film you will kind of feel happy cause like many other ghibli films this one also has positive attitude as the nature of people projected is a gentle and kind. The film progresses slowly and manages to keep you interested because of the adorable faces of the two major characters. After the halftime the story takes huge leaps of imaginations and you are now completely into the film. Sometimes you want to laugh, cry, get mad and all those emotions are aroused in this show of the film. <br/><br/>Cons: Nothing as such but sometimes I feel that by showing us cute little faces and their innocence, aren't they enjoying the benefit of kindness?<br/><br/>MESSAGE: ""Never forget the simple pleasures of life.""<br/><br/>VERDICT: ""Highly recommended for all animation lovers."""

","As we all know, Hayao Miyazaki is a master story-teller and animation director. This movie is one of his earlier gems, released back in 1988.<br/><br/>With a warm & friendly story, and interesting characters & situations, the visually arresting movie takes us on a joy ride. No Villains, No Songs, No Adult humour - Just a simple adventurous journey of two sisters. The human characters are so real, lively and sincere. Their interaction with the warm and likable fantasy characters is enjoyable. A person of any age and taste can enjoy the movie. It delights you, without being crude or vulgar.<br/><br/>Trivia: The movie is slightly autobiographical. When Miyazaki and his brothers were children, his mother suffered from spinal tuberculosis for nine years, and spent much of her time hospitalized. It is implied, yet never revealed in the film, that Satsuki and Mei's mother also suffers from tuberculosis. He once said the film would have been too painful for him to make if the two protagonists were boys instead of girls."

","Hayao Miyazaki may be better known for his western market breakthrough film, Spirited Away (which undoubtedly is one of the greatest ever animated movies) but for me, 'My Neighbour Totoro' is also up there with the best of them too.<br/><br/>I won't go into too much detail about the film itself, suffice to say that it is a charming little movie whose characters will endear themselves to anyone with even the slightest sprinkling of good spirit in their soul.<br/><br/>I first watched it at the age of twelve on returning home from a day at school. Despite missing the first fifteen minutes, I could instantly tell that I was going to be glued to my television screen for the duration! It was also my first experience of a Miyazaki film and introduced me in fine style to this master film maker.<br/><br/>Roll forward 20 years, and here I am still captivated by this wonderful movie. The film's core message of being a free spirit and embracing the opportunity for adventure really is something that all children(and adults too) need to be taught in a society where from an early age we are conditioned to be mistrustful of others and overly cautious of our surroundings.<br/><br/>What the big western animation studios like Disney and Pixar fail to grasp is that life isn't always about good vs evil or right vs wrong. Studio Ghibli is about the depth of their characters and the wonder of the locations.<br/><br/>Finally, what this film really reflects well is that life is often just a series of random occurrences that should be savoured before they are over.<br/><br/>If you understand that then this film will resonate with you and you should go and watch it.

","If it wasn't for John Lasseter's (creator of Toy Story) love for Japanese anime, we would probably be in the dark still without the knowledge of the existence of Studio Ghibli, the next best animation studio after Disney Pixar. He helped in introducing to the world Ghibli's fantastic films. Hayao Miyazaki, Director and Screenwriter, contributed more handsomely to the studio's achievement and success. And My Neighbor Totoro is one of his greatest achievements, probably in the entire cinematic world. This was the first time I saw what they call ""True Art"" in any animated movie. The story is of two sisters, Mei and Satsuki, who with their father move to a new home. The two of them then happen to meet Totoro, a forest spirit who helps grow plants in the nearby forest. <br/><br/>What unfolds next is a gentle heartwarming film experience that surprisingly leaves us nostalgic. Although the film seems to concentrate on a very young audience, it was an experience like Toy Story. What I love about this film is the way it takes time and allows us to get lost in Totoro's world. One scene I recall the most is the scene when the two girls and Totoro are waiting, just waiting, at a bus stop taking shelter in umbrellas from the rain. Miyazaki captured the calmness so perfectly that it made me think,""You don't get to see this even on Winnie the Pooh"". That scene truly is one the greatest moments in all of cinema and is one of the reasons why I love his films so much. In this way, Miyazaki is extremely skilled at creating a lovely environment in his films, in this case the environment is more nature oriented. Joe Hisaishi's score too is great as always, he has scored almost all Miyazaki films.<br/><br/>Miyazaki is well-known for his signature style of feminism, environmentalism and aviation. He uses all of these in Totoro. After Mickey Mouse, Teddy Bear and Winnie the Pooh, you will always find Totoro as the most favorite children's character. The innocence of Totoro is delightful for kids but more surprising thing is that the adults found it more moving and more meaningful and as I said earlier, Nostalgic...<br/><br/>Totoro, when released in 1988, created a sensation in the animation world and Studio Ghibli gained recognition. It was only after Totoro that Miyazaki was going to receive the title of one of the greatest film-makers of our time that to this date has remained consistent. <br/><br/>(\_(\ <br/><br/>(=' ﻿;') <br/><br/>( (""""))<br/><br/>Check out my other reviews at this page: https://www.facebook.com/filmsthemostbeautifulart"

The love and care this movies showed made me cry. It shows us the way human being should live their lives. After watching this movie, i started to realize that I should live my life helping others and keep people around me happy. What a magical movie this is.

","Another one in my mini Studio Ghibli series. I remember the first time I saw this how blown away I was by the way everything looked so natural. The way people move, the animals and the plants all drawn with such care and attention to detail. Add to that a magical story and you've got what Disney is constantly on the lookout for. Unfortunately (for them) it's a story that I don't think would translate well for the markets they're catering for. But I digress, here is a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts on the matter.<br/><br/>Satsuki and Mei have moved house with their father so they can be near their mother who is in hospital. Their new house is in the countryside next to a forest. The girls have great fun exploring and when Satsuki has to go to school Mai goes off on her own. She discovers some magical forest creatures, Totoro's, one of which is of massive proportions! Soon Satsuki sees him too and they have many adventures together. But when Mei gets lost and Satsuki has exhausted every other avenue of help, it's to Totoro that she turns Can he help her find her little sister? Well, I guess I had better not tell you that or the Spoiler Police (Ghibli Division) will be revoking my viewing rights (again).<br/><br/>Beautifully animated with great attention to detail, I really love the way this film looks. I watched it in Japanese with subtitles and I didn't mind one bit, it's a really easy plot to follow and so not too taxing on the little grey cells. I will give honourable mentions to the voice talents of; Noriko Hidaka as Satsuki, Chika Sakamoto as Mei, Shigesato Itoi as Tatsuo Kusakabe (the father) and Sumi Shimamoto as Yasuko Kusakabe (the mother).<br/><br/>A simple story is the backbone of this film; the magical world of Totoro really makes it a terrific watch. On the downside, I did find the girls voices tended to get a little grating towards the end most of their dialogue seems to be SHOUTED! Apart from that, I found it beautiful to look at with a quite magical tale, not a lot to dislike here Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 8.6/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 8.2/10 (based on 47,047 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 90/100 (based on 29 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 67/100 (based on 76,524 user ratings counted at the time of going to press)."

Their house is close to the forest and they soon befriend these Totoro who are monsters that live in the forest. In addition they have several magical adventures. The story is set in the 1950s, so 20th century Japan. Although my life and their life are not the same, I can know how people lived in the 1950s. It takes place in Tokorozawa city in Saitama in Japan. I liked the film because Totoro is so cute! Furthermore, it reminds me of feelings when I was a child. At the end of the film, although their mother had been in hospital and had a serious illness, she was very well. As a result, Satsuki, Mei and their father prepared to welcome their mother home.

","A wonderful Japanese anime about two little girls and their coping with the sickness of their mother. Through letting loose their imagination and crawling through the rabbit hole, they discover a magnificent world. But unlike Alice in Wonderland, there's no evil in their world. Only totoros, spirit-like creatures only visible in the eyes of lucky children. The parents of the girls listen to their kids and don't accuse them of lying. They actually do the contrary and encourage them to have a vivid imagination. This is probably the best message for young children. <br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli present a classic but colorful world with great details. It's a treat for the beholders.

","We all know Hayao Miyazaki is an anime genius, creating stories focusing on character, story and fantasy, letting his imagine run wild. He has created great films like Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke. My Neighbour Totoro is considered one of his first great works.<br/><br/>Mr. Kusakabe (Shigesato Itoi) and his two daughters Satsuki (Noriko Hidaka) and Mei (Chika Sakamoto) move to a new home in rural Japan so they could be close to their sick mother (Sumi Shimamoto). They new home is run down and filled with soot spirits, but the family soon settle in. One day Mei meets a strange giant creature called Totoro, a large furry animal who has two minions. No one believes Mei at first but after Mei disappears Satsuki has to call Totoro for help.<br/><br/>My Neighbour Totoro is a strange little film, but Miyazaki does have an understanding of a child's imagine (either that or he takes a lot powerful narcotics). There is a certain Alice in Wonderland feel about the film, with Mei going down a hole and Totoro and the Catbus (one of the weirdest ideas ever) looking like the Chester Cat. But the main focus of the film is the relationship between the young girls and the their father who is obviously overwhelmed with his caring for the girls, having a wife in hospital and continuing with his job. The children are energetic and believable and the film is about the wonders of a child's imagination. Only the children can see the creatures and it is almost dream like. But the girls are also dealing with a proper issues, particularly Satsuki who has to act as Mei's guardian and tries to be strong because Mei does not truly understand what's happening to their mum. What surprised me was that My Neighbour Totoro was very grounded, focusing on the girls: I would have liked to have seen more interaction with the creatures, especially because Miyazaki is so great at creating worlds and a great fantasy storytelling.<br/><br/>The animation is great, as is expected from a Miyazaki film and there are some very surreal moments. The film is fast paced as hoped for in a children's animated film. But the film is so fast that some things are not explained, like a young boy, Kanta (Toshiyuki Amagasa)'s animosity towards Satsuki. He said that its because that there house is haunted, but surely there was more, maybe he was hurt by Totoro or the house or maybe it is something more basic, like he finds girls inky or fancies Satsuki and he does not know what to do about it.<br/><br/>My Neighbour Totoro does have a very sweet nature about it, about how characters interact and the way Totoro and his friends reaction to humans, the small creatures being like normal animals with mystical powers. Totoro is a curious creature who is interested by the children's kindness and the gift of a umbrella, leading to the simple wonders of a big water drops hitting the umbrella. There is also the great Miyazaki trait of silence, letting scenes and actions play out without much sound or dialogue. It plays a universal audience. It was a charming atmosphere."

","Unlike a lot of other's reviewing this, i didn't grow up watching this. I watched this movie for the first time in 2010, and i was 19. I'm capable of temporarily adjusting the age of my mind, to enjoy the more simple films, and view them as they were meant to be seen, and understood. That being said, i won't be judging this film and nitpicking the smallest of problems in the view because those problems are irrelevant considering this is a cartoon written, and made for children.<br/><br/>Although this movie is aimed at children, it is unique, and different enough compared to other children's movies that it almost gives off this ""Wizard of Oz"" feeling, where you can enjoy this as a true piece of art, rather than another lame children's movie thrown together over night.<br/><br/>The depth in these girls are outstanding for such a simple film, and it feels as if you really know them by the end. And Totoro is just adorable. The person behind the idea of this character is very creative and original.<br/><br/>You can poke holes in this story, and point out a few things that don't add up, but in the end it has a lot of things that don't work in our ""real"" world, so you shouldn't expect the movie to make complete absolute sense.<br/><br/>The bottom line is, if you can watch a touching, and heartwarming children's movie without thinking ""This is totally gay!"", and you're mature enough to connect with these characters than it's a movie you can watch and enjoy over and over again.<br/><br/>So if you haven't seen this, check it out. It is definitely worth your time."

","Another beauty from Ghibli Studios and Hayao Miyazaki.<br/><br/>My neighbor Totoro tells the story of two young children -Satsuki and Mei- who move to the countryside with their father to a new house to prepare the arrival of their mother from hospital.<br/><br/>The script is simpler than Miyazaki's other movies, but it is tremendously enjoyable and captivating despite its flaws. In fact, this is, perhaps, Miyazaki's sweetest movie ever, as it is captures the essence of being a child, with the innocence, naughtiness and magic that surround it. We see the simple things that make children happy: playing with little things, imagining things, the thrill of moving to a new place and making new friends, siblings' relationships of dependence, love and hatred, and the magic that innocence can create. Anybody can remember special moments of his/her childhood when watching this movie.<br/><br/>Much of the appeal of the film are the characters of the two little girls and their neighbor old ""grandma nanny"" to whom the viewer feels immediately drawn, but also to the quirky plush-ish characters of Totoro and friends. The dubbing of the actors in the Japanese version is excellent and really honors the characters and makes them even more adorable.<br/><br/>Not less important in the movie, is the fantastic drawing of the Japanese scenery, so beautiful and emotionally connected to the story. The landscape, and Nature, play an important part in the movie, and, as in other Miyaki's films, the themes of the magic in Nature and the power of being in harmony with the environment are also explored here.<br/><br/>A delightful movie for children and animation lovers in general."

Mei soon discovers that creatures called Totoros are living in the nearby forest, and Mei and her sister become friends with the Totoros.<br/><br/>The family's struggles in My Neighbor Totoro were extremely realistic, and even though for the most part it was not a very serious film, I think the problems that the family faces could really appeal to more than just children. The English voices for this film I thought were very good, but I definitely prefer it to be in Japanese, so if you are faced with that choice, I would suggest Japanese with English subtitles. Now, Spirited Away is the only other Miyazaki film I have ever seen, so My Neighbor Totoro was not quite as good as Spirited Away, but by all means still a great film. The story, like Spirited Away, was very creative, and I am quickly becoming a huge fan of the Japanese animation master, Hayao Miyazaki.<br/><br/>I was surprised to find that there was no villain in the story. Unlike Spirited Away where the hero of our story is against certain characters in the film, My Neighbor Totoro is basically just about the life of the children, and often has things about both the parents in the movie. The animation was beautiful. It was absolutely stunning. Which is one of my favorite things about Miyazaki's films, or at least the ones I have seen. The animation is so incredible, even if someone was to not like the story, I don't see how anyone could complain about the visuals.<br/><br/>Overall, Hayao Miyazaki yet again shows us a wonderful world of imagination, and storytelling, in his film My Neighbor Totoro. While it has its flaws, it is still worthy of multiple viewings."

","In 1988, after the delightful Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984) and Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), Hayao Miyazaki turned his attention to an even younger audience for this sugar-sweet fairy tale charting the adventures of the two young girls, Satsuki (Noriko Hidaka) and Mei (Chika Sakamoto), who move to the countryside with their university professor father (Shigesato Itoi) to be near the hospital where their mother (Sumi Shimamoto) recovers from a nameless illness.<br/><br/>It is narrower of scope than the aforementioned classics - deliberately so, because this is a essentially a small-scale drama about a family coping with a terminal illness. That sounds dreadfully morose for what is a work aimed at very young children, but it's all played out very cheerfully, as we gradually enter the kids' fantastical world. In this world they meet the sleepy troll called Totoro. Their passion gives him a reason to awaken, and he becomes the totem of strength and vitality the girls need to cope with the uncertainty surrounding their mother's condition.<br/><br/>We often speak of Pixar's and Dreamworks' canniness with the subtle grown-up substance of their animations. But Miyazaki goes beyond winks and trivial references. Perhaps it is the simplicity of his refreshingly formless narrative, but his symbolism has never been stronger than here. At one point, Mei becomes disillusioned by the fact that her acorns will not grow. Then, one night, she and Satsuki meet Totoro and perform a strange rain dance. The acorns don't just grow - an oak tree explodes from the earth, growing a hundred feet high in seconds. It's just one of many beautiful, hopeful scenes, all of which are delivered with a delirious smile.<br/><br/>There is more than one nod to Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland: Mei enter's Totoro's realm through a mazy, rabbit hole-style tunnel, while the hilarious 'Catbus' bears the perennial grin of the Cheshire Cat. But parents should not worry about any lurid drug references - this is a film that relishes the trappings of innocence better than any other I've seen."
"danjakubik","9","0","1","15 March 2010"," A highly charming, imaginative and heartwarming animated film.
","""My Neighbor Totoro""<br/><br/>Animated, 1988, Japan<br/><br/>Running time: 88 minutes <br/><br/>Written and directed by: Hiyao Miyazaki<br/><br/>* * * 1/2 Very Good<br/><br/>I happened to see this film March 13, 2010, for the very first time and have many positive adjectives of praise for this film fresh in mind. My first impressions are: ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is an exceptionally imaginative, detailed, charming, heartwarming and very cute film. Japan has mastered cute probably better than anyone else in the world. Cute is relatively easy to achieve, especially in an animated film, as the legacy of Disney shows. So, cute, really is a weak adjective of praise here.<br/><br/>""My Neighbor Totoro"", 1988, is the first feature length animated film from the acclaimed animation director Hayao Miyazaki of Japan. Prior to this film, he worked in television, but found that artistically unsatisfying over time. Miyazaki has said, at first, he did not consider animation, as the medium of choice, for his imaginative stories and career change. For anyone with a large and vivid imagination, animation is the ideal choice of expression. If one can imagine it, one can bring it to life in animation, without difficulty or great expense, as compared to live action film.<br/><br/>What most impressed me about this film is Miyazaki's keen knowledge and expression of how it feels to be a child, how we perceive and react to the world around us, with energy, excitement, enthusiasm, imagination and curiosity. To me, this is what came across, most profoundly. Animation and sound are good overall in the film, nothing especially impressive. This is to be expected, as a first time feature length film director rarely is granted a large budget for their very first film. What's impressive about ""My Neighbor Totoro"", is the storytelling. That's what matters most, of course. Film is simply a highly visual medium of storytelling.<br/><br/>Miyazaki based the story of the film on his own childhood, growing up in rural Japan during the 1950's. All of the locations in the animated film, have their real life counterparts in Japan. The story concerns two young girls and their father, who move into a new countryside home, while their mother is away, sick in a hospital. Totoro can best be described as a large, gentle, friendly, furry, teddy bear-cat kind of creature, who is actually a spirit of the forest, near the new home of the two girls. Miyazaki is wise to hold off and wait until the halfway point of the story, to introduce the main character of Totoro, to build up the anticipation of Totoro's arrival in the film. The cat bus is an especially charming and imaginative character that appears later in the film. Miyazki's story telling style keeps some suspense going, regarding the mother's relation to the story.<br/><br/>Miyzaki's film takes it's time to slowly introduce it's characters and become acquainted with them. Clearly, Miyazaki is a gifted storyteller, with heart and details in his characters and stories. What people appreciate most about his animated films is that they are about ordinary, common people in extraordinary situations and told with heart, charm, genuine emotion and special little details, regarding the characters, landscapes and inventions. <br/><br/>When first released theatrically in Japan, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" was only modestly successful. When it was later released on television in Japan, it took off in popularity.<br/><br/>I have seen a number of Miyazaki films since his ""Princess Mononoke"", 1997, before seeing ""My Neighbor Totoro"", his very first film. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" by itself, is enough to have made me a Miyazaki fan, if I had seen it years ago, before I ever saw any of his other animated films.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's animated films are the type that always present something new both in characters and inventions, in an engaging and captivating way. With most of his animated films, it always worth experiencing them again and they continue to delight and entertain, both children and adults alike.<br/><br/>I consider myself a child at heart. I remember how it felt to be a child. How the world seemed so different at that time in life.. Children perceive and react to the world much differently than adults. Viewing a film such as ""My Neighbor Totoro"", Miyazaki recaptures childhood very accurately. Doesn't really matter he is Japanese. Children are children, with the same traits, all over the world, regardless of country or culture.<br/><br/>To me, Miyazaki deserves comparison to the great animation pioneer, Walt Disney. I realize this is a big compliment, however I feel that Miyazaki has earned and deserves comparison to Disney. Like Disney, Miyazaki is also highly imaginative, artistic and detailed with his animation stories, as was Walt Disney. I consider Miyazaki, the new Disney. Miyazaki is an excellent story teller and deserves his exalted and admired status within the animation industry, here in the United States."

","My Neighbor Totoro is one of those truly wonderful films that transcend the words ""heartwarming"" and ""joyful."" This is a movie that any human from 5 to 95 can enjoy. There is something truly powerful and transcendent about happiness and innocence; and Totoro is a reminder that there is something happy and joyful inside all of us that is truly our strength, and the basis for life itself. <br/><br/>Totoro is a superior movie that stands on its own, without reference to pop-culture tawdriness, melodrama, or mindless violence. <br/><br/>Totoro is a great barometer for friends and relationships. If you have doubts about the sanity of anybody you know, play this movie for them. Haters, anti-social types, and people with indelible character flaws won't like this movie, and you can dump them!<br/><br/>And oh by the way, the animation is awesome."

","There really are no ""bad"" Miyazaki movies. And Totoro was the 2nd one of his movies I'd seen, and after seeing most if not all of his movies, this one remains my favorite. It captures childhood innocence and countryside playing immaculately while introducing one of the most recognizable and iconic cartoon characters ever to come from Japan. Totoro is pure enjoyment and fun. From the music to the animation and the beloved Totoro and Neko-Bus, this movie shines and charms. There are so many wonderful scenes and most people will rightfully point to the bus-stop scene as the centerpiece scene - it's my favorite in the movie too no doubt; to add to that I liked the simple countryside story, the settings, background, the noises and sounds and the life depicted. The Japanese voice actors do a fine job as usual too. Totoro is a true classic of animation - as good or better as any Disney or other animation ever crafted, and most likely will remain my particular favorite. Simple, playful, and warm, Totoro will charm like few movies can. Tops - Highly recommended."

","Hayao Miyazaki is one of my favorite directors, and not one of his films had disappointed me. Totoro is no exception, and is wonderful to watch when you don't feel like watching a movie with car chases, or transforming robots or bond villains or whatever. It's just a really relaxing film to watch and can really calm you down. Despite lacking in plot, it gains its story from everyday situations, and leaves you feeling satisfied at the end. A great thing for me was how much it reminded me of my own childhood, how you would wander off and get lost, exploring and the excitement of moving into a new house. I totally recommend this for anyone. People call it a children's movie, but to be honest, anyone can watch and fall in love with it."

","Maybe its nostalgia, because it was my first. Before I knew anything about anime or Miyazaki, I saw this on a rack at a supermarket in the early '90s and begged my mom to get it for me on VHS. And I'm so glad that she did, because this is one of the greatest films of all time. I liked it then, but I do remember thinking it was a bit slow and silly. But watching it now, its a wondrous tale of childhood and growing up. It's also the most different of Miyazaki's tales, I think, which gives it its own sort of value. Even though I feel this movie is perhaps spiritually closest to Spirited Away, a movie I never really liked all that much, it captures so well the awe of exploring as a child and the heartache of life's troubles seen through the lens of a child. This isn't so much a movie for children, but a movie about children for adults, a movie that allows them to travel back in time to when they were children. No movie so perfectly captures the magic of youth at My Neighbor Totoro."

","Today I saw this fun filled masterpiece by Miyazaki.... the first half of the film breezes through and is thoroughly entertaining. The characters of Satsuki & Mei are brilliant to say the least, especially Mei's, who's a treat to watch. The movie says the story of two little sisters who shift to a new place with their father and the whimsical adventures that happen in that short stay of theirs.It tells us that the uncertainties of life offer us all the interesting escapades it needs. I had apprehensions before seeing the dubbed version. But the English dub blew me away. I have yet to come across a better dub than this. The voice overs and accents were brilliant. The movie is simple, entertaining and you cant help but smile throughout while watching this bizarre yet enchanting drama unfold before your very eyes. The main character of this movie was Totoro who's very cute and kind and stays in a big tree. I would have loved to see more of him though. In the little span of 80 minutes we go across so many emotions and yet when the movie is done you can recollect each and everyone of them. If this movie doesn't warm you nothing ever will. This movie demands a repeated viewing, and I will give it one in days to come. Till then I will wait for my Totoro."

","There are very few directors/writers that can bring a ""G"" rated family film that is not only entertaining to children, but a wonder for adults. Before bringing us treasures like ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"", My Neighbor Totoro showcased where Hayao Miyazaki would be for the next 20 years: on top of the animation game.<br/><br/>A father moves in to an old home with his two daughters, Satsuki, the older sister, and Mei, who looks to be about 5. Mother is sick, & away at the hospital, and they have an opportunity to see her sometimes. They meet new friends, including a boy who tells them the place they moved into is haunted. The new place is wondrous, but perhaps a little creepy. What happens after this is up to you. It's either a big, colorful part of a child's imagination, a real magical adventure, or a hallucinogenic trip from a mushroom accidentally eaten in the big backyard they have. NO, scratch that last part.<br/><br/>They soon encounter a ""Totoro"" a big, fluffy bear/cat/bird like creature who's as gentle as a sleepy puppy. Oh, he just happens to be the king of the forest. Other encounters include a cat bus, ""dust bunnies"" or ""soot sprites"" that are also found later in Miyazaki's Spirited Away, & a tree that... well I don't want to give it away.<br/><br/>It's simplicity is deceiving. The movie moves slow and makes you think that nothing much else is going to happen, yet by it's end we have seen everything from forming friendships, the importance of family, commune with nature & the human spirit in it's way of overcoming life's problems.<br/><br/>About the only problem I had with the movie is that it was way too short! Not short by the standard family animation, but short for a Miyazaki movie, who's films usually clock in at 2 hours! Regardless, this is a must see. My daughters love it, and stand absolutely mesmerized in delight. So do I. Even the credits are a treat!"

","""Tonari no Totoro"" is yet another masterpiece from one of the most fantastic minds in the world. Where does Hayao Miyazaki take all his magical tales from? The feature from 1988 tells us the story about Satsuki and Mei, two little girls brought up in rural Japan by their father. The movie starts when the little family are on their way to their new house, which they have moved to so they can be closer to the hospital where their ill mother is staying.<br/><br/>One day while playing outside, four year old Mei wanders off in to the forest, following two strange little creatures. They lead her into a hollow in a enormous tree where she falls down and lands on the belly of an enormous version of the little ones. The creature gasps loudly, and Mei interprets the sound as To-to-ro, before she falls to sleep on it.<br/><br/>This is only the start of Miyazakis magical and wonderful tale, which includes raising giant trees from little seeds, flying through the countryside on Totoro and an amazing bus who looks just like a cat and jumps instead of rolling! A must-see for every child and adults in contact with their own child inside. Miyazaki-san, I bow my head in awe. A perfect 10/10"

","In 1988, Studio Ghibli took quite a financial risk in making two films at the same time. One was ""Grave of the Fireflies"", Isao Takahata's undeniable masterpiece. The other one is this, Hayao Miyazaki's final break through as an internationally known director, ""My Neighbour Totoro"" (Tonari no Totoro, 1988). Although the difference between the two films is like a day and night, they have both earned their places amongst great animations. If ""Grave of the Fireflies"" made you cry, ""Totoro"" will quickly put a smile back to your face.<br/><br/>The story centers around two sisters, Satsuki and Mei, who move to country with their father, while their mother is recovering in a hospital from an unspecified illness. While the girls try to cope with their mother's situation and their new environment, they also meet a strange spirit named Totoro who lives in the nearby forest.<br/><br/>There really is nothing more to tell about the plot without giving away too much. ""Totoro"" is a very simple film and works that way. It's absolutely positive film, one that makes you smile, no matter if you're a child of not. This may be the most ""suitable for children film"" Miyazaki has made, but it is certainly suitable for more mature viewers also. I am nearly 20 year old guy and I think this is a fantastic film. It's such a perfect family movie in many ways. For one there are the fantasy elements with Totoro (who looks so utterly incredible that it's no wonder it made to Ghibli's logo) and the various incredible things the girls experience with it. But there are also suitable amount of realism (with the mother and her illness) that the film stays nicely close to earth.<br/><br/>I really have difficult time explaining what makes this film so unique. Like most Ghibli films you just have to experience them. The various scenes in this film are at the same time so simple and yet so imaginative you wouldn't believe it (my favorite is the scene where Satsuki and Totoro both wait a buss in the rain). ""Totoro"" simply has that magic of animation that makes you love it. Technically the film is yet another sample of Miyazaki's talents, and with this film I believe he finally reached his own style that has followed to his later films. Joe Hisaishi once again creates the most magical music that a film like this deserves. I haven't heard either of the two English dubs so I can't tell about them, but Japanese audio is once again done with professional talent. The older sister Satsuki is voiced by Noriko Hidaka, whom anime fans know as Akane in ""Ranma 1/2"", Jean in ""Nadia: the Secret of Blue Water"", Kikyo in ""Inuyasha"" and Near in ""Death Note"". In a minor role as the mother of the girls, is Sumi Shimamoto, who voiced the title character in early Ghibli movie ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"".<br/><br/>I really would want to recommend this film more and tell about how fantastic and adorable it is, but I simply can't find words for it. I happily recommend this film, no matter if you watch it alone or with a whole family. It made me smile like a ten year old, and that doesn't happen very often. This film lasts through many views."
"RainDogJr","Null","0","1","1 June 2008"," となりのトトロ: A wonderful gem about/for the family
","As for many others, I guess, Spirited Away was my introduction to the work of Hayao Miyazaki and as many others, I loved that picture when I saw it on theaters back in the year 2003. Now thanks to my cousin I have seen My Neighbor Totoro on DVD and I can say that is just another gem of Miyazaki.<br/><br/>Is a simple but wonderful story about family and the rural Japan is the place for this story. You will be always kind of worry about the two main characters of the story: Satsuki and Mei, two sisters of 10 and 5 years old respectively. Their mother must be at the hospital so they must stay only with their father Tatsuo who works at the University. All of this makes that the girls stay a lot of time alone in a place where getting lost seems very easy but they take care of each other as good sisters. Of course Miyazaki immense imagination is here, of course to help this little girls and when Totoro appears is just fun. I really love this amazing character; sort of a big rabbit that seems always to be very lazy but the magic is here and with the Catbus (another product of Miyazaki's trip) they become soon the adoration and the helpers of the sisters. Is a family movie so is always present the feel of being worried about a family member (the absence of the mother of course but there are many scenes where you can find that feel, for example when it's raining in the bus stop in what probably is my favourite scene) but also that feel of being helped by the people near to you (in this case the people of the village were very kind and really helpful), never loosing the hopes.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you ask me about the animation, I have few words to say: is a piece of work. And if you ask me about the dubbing, well I watched the version of Spain and it's pretty good but I do have desires to watch the film with the original language. Anyway, My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful gem for the whole family (I actually saw this with two of my cousins and with my grandma and the four of us loved the film) and personally after watching my second Miyazaki film I do have a lot of desires to check his entire work. Keep on smoking Hayao!"
"dodo1066","7","0","4","10 August 2007"," A nice film for a quiet evening
","Firstly i have to say that i enjoyed this film. It was really beautiful to watch, especially with the rolling Japanese countryside, (as with all Miyakazi films) and was suitably short. Many of the scenes were innovative and i particularly enjoyed the cat bus scenes. However, as much as i liked the film, there were some major flaws, the main reason i only gave this film 7 out of 10. The first Miyakazi film i watched was Howl's Moving Castle, an epic film which i thoroughly enjoyed and watched multiple times. Howls Castle had a good script and good English voice-overs, but most importantly it had a credible plot and at the end of the film, i was left feeling i had achieved something by watching it. Unfortunately, this film didn't really go anywhere, and despite the fact i enjoyed it, i wasn't very pleased with it. The characters began to grate, especially the little child (Mia?), and the script was very weak. It may be that the English translation was very poor, and in that case, it was acceptable, but i was unimpressed with it at the end of the day. On the other hand, the shortness of the film saved it, and i would definitely recommend this as a good children's film, though I'm not sure it would appeal to a lot of adults, (i am typing here aware that a good deal of adults have commented and really enjoyed this film, but this is purely my humble opinion). I think 7 is a perfectly decent score for a perfectly decent film, but i think it is somewhat lacking in some departments, and that is a little bit disappointing."

","This is my fourth film from this celebrated animation artist; while I've always enjoyed his work, I still feel that it's somewhat overrated. The ones I'd watched - PRINCESS MONONOKE (1997), SPIRITED AWAY (2001; his best, in my opinion) and HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (2004) - were all plot-packed, overwhelming visual experiences, so I was surprised to find this one much simpler, virtually kiddie-oriented and essentially plot less! It was still meticulously detailed and inventive, with two extremely likable female protagonists and equally delightful anthropomorphic characters - not to mention an infectious title track. I've yet to catch up with quite a number of his films (TCM showed a retrospective of his work while I was in Hollywood late last year, but I didn't have the time - or stamina - for them) but, given their basic similarity, I guess it's best to approach them one at a time (my local DVD rental outlet does carry a few more titles, though)..."

The images of a culture, a society and a lifestyle deserve carefully study, repeated viewing and, in my opinion, emulation.<br/><br/>I was fascinated by the details of the architecture of the country house to which the girls moved. They illustrate the unique and charming features of traditional Japanese domestic architecture. The, to me, novel character of the mythical folklore characters found in the film was an eyeopening experience.

And even though it's very very very cute, it also deals with heavier issues e.g. the mother issue, but it's believable, even though it has a strong fantasy element And while Monsters Inc is good because it makes monsters less scary for kids, I think this film is better, because the monsters in this film are not scary, and wonderful, but that sound that the big Totoro makes was a classic monster sound. It scared the crap out of my dogs. :-)<br/><br/>Better than Spirited Away in my opinion."
"ginger_the_Wolf","9","0","1","3 September 2006"," If you don't love it, you may not have a heart.
","This is my third Miyazaki film, and I've yet to be disappointed. The only thing I regret about this film, as well as Spirited Away is that I didn't have an opportunity to see them as a child. In this beautifully crafted film, two little girls and their father move to the country to be closer to their ailing mother who is in the hospital. In their new home they find forest spirits who become their friends.<br/><br/>It is almost inevitable that I compare Miyazaki with Walt Disney. He is often called Japan's Disney. Although, I grew up with Disney, it's obvious for me that Miyaki's crafting is far more complex and less condescending than Disney. For the most part clichés are avoided (like Adults don't believe the children's fantasy world), and the children seem so much truer to the real world. They are sometimes annoying, loud and they're always laughing. These films seem to be so much more linked to culture, and it's interesting the differences in culture between the East and the West, especially in regards to mythology and nature.<br/><br/>This film is bittersweet and it appeals to both children and adults. It's enchanting, and unlike many children films there are villains and the typical adults vs. children storyline is thankfully not employed. However, this film is not without it's tension and even those moments of loss of hope and even fear, it just never uses extremes or hate to create them. Most of all though, the stunningly beautiful and detailed animation is stunning. It's original and imaginative, just the thing to capture your attention. The beautiful watercolour backgrounds seem so rich and unbearably beautiful, that that alone can be warrant for this excellent film."

It seems as if Miyazaki knows what goes on in the mind of a child, because when I watched it when i was little, it just had this certain indescribable spark. He truly is a genius.

","TOTORO, in classic Miyazaki tradition, brings the fantastic into the realm of everyday occurrences. The underlying story is rather unextraordinary: a Japanese father moves into the countryside with his two daughters, and they adjust to their new pastoral environment while waiting for the mother to be released from the hospital. We are not explained exactly why the mother is bedridden, but the ambiguous reason for her hospitalization plays an effective role in keeping the dramatic tension taught throughout the film. However, the plot is driven mainly by the imagination of the two children whose experiences with the magical create the driving mechanism behind the film. <br/><br/>Without giving anything away, TOTORO is a heartwarming film that inspires both the young and the old alike. Watching the film again several years after seeing it in the theaters, I realize that the story works not because it is about fantastic and magical characters but rather it involves everyday struggles to which we can relate. In TOTORO, we see Miyaki revisiting the same themes (involving familial harmony, nature, environmental awareness, courage, etc.) that he further develops in his later works. Nevertheless, the mastery and the imagination behind his craft keeps the story fresh. <br/><br/>Despite what the Box Office report card may indicate for TOTORO, this is a film sure to be a hit with the family."

"lilliquist","9","0","2","13 July 2006"," Excellent family movie - in several versions
","In case you do not already know, this is one of the great animated family movies of all time, another gem by the Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli (maker of ""Kiki's Delivery Service""). Any description of the story in mere words comes up short, especially since some of the most important parts of the story do not involve dialog per se. The story follows two young girls as they move into an old country house with their father while their mother is away in the hospital. There's no conflict driven plot, no good versus evil struggle, just a tale of discovery and wonder, and genuine emotion. Unlike most movies -- but like real life -- events seem to unfold naturally at their own pace. Rather than the audience being told what to think, and how to feel, Miyazaki lets us follow along while the two children discover and then befriend an amazing magical creature (Totoro) living in the enormous tree next door, a symbolic representation of both nature and the power of childhood imagination. Highly recommended for ages 6 through 60.<br/><br/>Originally in Japanese, Totoro has been dubbed into English twice, the second time by media giant Disney using Hollywood talents such as Dakota Fanning and Tim Daly. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the Disney product is a bit ""flatter."" Disney also messed around with the dialog -- dumbing things down in an attempt to make things more easily understood. The result is that characters seem less intelligent and less is left to the imagination - which is exactly the opposite of Miyazaki's purpose in making movies all about imagination and a respect for children. The Disney version is available in DVD, but if you can find the older version on VHS videotape, I'd recommend it. It is not so much that the older version is perfect (it has its own drawbacks), but that the older version seems truer to the original spirit of Miyazaki."

The quality of the mise-en-scene was astounding. Nowhere besides in Japanese cinema do you get such images; The long shots, with little or no movement, a form of sentimentality in its most subtle form; The blending of colour so soft that the softest of sunsets cannot match this films tranquility; Combining images of normality and comfort with images of the fantastic, making us feel that even the typical is an extraordinary event. Cinema is not about story telling. The true cinematic masterpiece tells a story with images. The true cinema is a dynamic series of impressions. It is why two directors can use the same screenplay and make two completely different films. I would never view this film for its narrative merit, but would see it again simply for the power of its image. This movie is deserving of the title ""Great Cinema"""

It starts out with 2 little girls, aged about 9 & 4, moving into their new house. The house is pretty run down, and it's my guess that the family moved there either to be closer to the hospital where the mother was, or to help pay for the mother's medical bills. After seeing some ""dust bunnies"", which later appear in Miazaki's ""Spirited Away"", the youngest girl goes exploring & finds a tunnel into another, magical world. When she falls asleep on Totoro, who is like a big cat tolerating a child pulling its tail, she wakes up in the tunnel, and when she tries to find her way back, the tunnel just goes back outside again. About 20& of the movie is like this, the girls discovering magic things that disappear. For being young, they have a lot to deal with. In one scene,, they wait all day & night in the rain for their dad to come. Totoro appears, and adorableness ensues. At the end, in the credits, the animators hint that the mother comes home & possibly has another baby. It's a good end to a good story, but one that might be missed if you leave early :P"

","We saw this movie at our last Japanese lesson we had at school for this semester. I hadn't seen it before (the anime-freaks looked doubtfully at me) and as it is a Studio Ghibli piece, I had quite a good feeling about that this was going to be a good one (as the vast majority of Ghibli's works are so neat). I must say that the story was sweet, and there is some kind of magic woven in here, enhancing the movie in some way, putting a smile on your lips for sure. I can't really point out anything specific that I got really hooked on, but there were something with the atmosphere I believe. A solid 7/10 well worth seeing for the whole family.

","This has been a childhood favorite of mine for a long time. And the first Hayao Miyazaki film I've seen(way before I even knew who he was).<br/><br/>This was released in Japan back in 1988 along with ""Grave of the Fireflies"" Came into the USA on VHS back in 1993(owned the Video for more than 10 years) and an upcoming DVD with a new English Debut coming in 2006! The story is taken place in the PostWar Era of Japan. With these 2 girls and their father moving to the Countryside. The girls like the house they've moved to(which is a 2 story home which is bigger than the other homes in the area). They're father is a College Professor. And their mother has a certain illness that had to be treated at this hospital that's in the country. Which is why they moved to the country so they can visit her more often.<br/><br/>The 2 girls Satsuki and Mei, are enjoying their new home and the country life. Little do they know is that their neighbor is a big and powerful forest spirit who loves kids.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie Totoro will help out Mei and Satsuki when they're in trouble. After you see the movie, you'd feel good about yourself.<br/><br/>Unlike other Family Films this one is very special. It has wonderfully done backgrounds, characters, and music. The story is well written too. It's rated G has only one bath scene with the Dad bathing with his 2 girl(there's no mild nudity in that scene just know that in Japan it's completely normal to have a family bath). There aren't any villains or any one too cruel. It's a safe and perfect movie for the whole family to watch.<br/><br/>I really recommend this to those who are Anime fans, Miyazaki fans, or even Animation fans.<br/><br/>Get the DVD as soon as possible once it's in stores!"

I discovered it just a few years ago and I thoroughly enjoy 'Future Boy Conan' and 'Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi' for instance.<br/><br/>This is also nice, the imagination to come up with nekobus (cat-bus) and the totoro is childlike in a good way.

","Totoro is about everyone's childhood. It was a wonderful experience to sit through this movie. Miyazaki successfully captured every little detail in a child's action and emotion, which everyone of us could relate to at one point or another. The first time I saw the movie was in Chinese (Cantonese). Since then, I have seen it in several dubbed versions including the original Japanese track. After having the chance to compare the different versions - I have to say the Cantonese version is by far the most effective, beating its original track. There are several sound effects in the Cantonese version, including the voices of the two smaller totoros, which do no exist in the original track. If you get a chance to hold on to the Hong Kong-imported DVDs, you will find both the Japanese (2.0) and Cantonese (5.1) tracks with English subtitles, and the movie is presented in widescreen.<br/><br/>*****/*****"

","This film is yet another masterpeice by my favourite director, Hayao Miyazaki. It's a beautiful adventure with very realistic-characters, and it has a unique feel to it; uplifting, but with depressing undertones. And to nit-pick at what someone else said, Totoro is not a gerble. Gerbles are rodents with long, rat-like tails. Totoro clearly is not a gerble. He's a spirit. Also, several people were complaining about the inadequicies of the Fox-dubbed DVD, and I just want to point out why the DVD is sub-par. A few years ago, Disney bought up the rights to several of Miyazaki's films (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, and Kiki's Delivery Service to name a few, with more being prepared for release.) Way back when FOX bought the rights, in the early nineties, they only got the rights to produce a dubbed, full-screen version, I believe. (I don't recall this one ever having a theatrical run, but it just might have. I think it was direct to video.) Back then, very few people knew that anime was ""more than just kids' cartoons,"" and the market for sub-titled anime was pretty small. Since DVD wasn't an issue back then, FOX didn't see a point in getting subtitling rights and wide-screen rights. (Also, for the early nineties, it's an EXCELLENT dub, and still is pretty good by today's standards.) Around the time that anime was getting more of a stronghold, Disney came along and made a deal with Studio Ghibli to get the rights to these movies. It's been aranged that Totoro's rights will be turned over to Disney in 2004, I believe, when it will be re-dubbed and re-released with all the extras and with other languages. Fox is just putting Totoro on DVD to a) make some money off of it while they can, and b) so that fans can have a copy of the Fox dub that won't deteriorate and will be able to withstand the years. Personally, I look foward to having both dubs on DVD and comparing them."

","It always amazes me that Film Production Companies think that most people are, essentially, stupid. Miyazaki Hayao is easily one of the greatest filmmakers in the world, his animation routinely surpasses that of nearly all American releases and more than hold their own against even classics of American, and world, animation. His films are the most popular in Japan and should be here. Yet almost none of his films have been released on DVD in the States, with the exception of Princess Mononoke (Mononoke Hime)(2000), and the ones available here are weak to say the least.<br/><br/>I just received My Neighbor Totoro DVD, one of my all time favorite flicks, expecting to find at least a couple of nice extras. Want to know what the features are? Pan and Scan! That's right not only is that a feature, it's not an extra feature so the only way to see the Fox Home Entertainment/Troma release is with the ends cut off! A fairly humiliating way for the world's greatest living animator to be honored.<br/><br/>Did I mention that there is only one audio track? The English dub, is pretty good, but I prefer to have the option of watching a film in its native language with subtitles. Oh and the third feature is a couple of trailers for some other lame Fox releases.<br/><br/>All in all a pretty sad DVD release that's only saving grace is that it's pretty cheap. But to be honest I'd prefer good to cheap.<br/><br/>For a ""must own"" film, and I do believe that, Fox Home Entertainment certainly makes buying their version less than appealing. Serious movie fans should buy a DVD player that plays copies from various regions.

","When I first learned that this movie had been released as a double feature with Grave of the Fireflies, I was, to say the least, confused.  But now I definitely see why that was done.<br/><br/>My Neighbor Totoro, once put into proper historical perspective, becomes a rather difficult film to watch, especially for someone born and raised in the country that put the Japanese in that situation all those many years ago.  All the clues are there--the mother in the hospital, Kanta's hat, the setting, the dress, and particularly the way the mother's medical condition is never discussed.  It doesn't come on as strong as Grave of the Fireflies; it's more an optimistic piece, an exercise in innocence and naiveity.<br/><br/>Or rather, how children deal with painful realities.<br/><br/>I hope I haven't given much away.  Anyway, this is definitely among Miyazaki's best; and I would go as far as to say it was one of the best animated films ever made, except for the way in which it ends (too abruptly and perhaps too soon).<br/><br/>Don't let the dub lead you to believe this is mere kiddie fare.  While it can be watched with the family, anyone with a brain won't be able to swallow it that easily.  (Methinks the realization that this ISN'T kiddie fare, contrary to what I've always been told, has sent me into more of a shock than anything else. ^_^)"

We have most of the popular Disney films as well as things like Babe, Antz and Beethoven, etc<br/><br/>So was it for this reason that a friend insisted on sending me My Neighbour Totoro, citing it as one of his favourite films?<br/><br/>I finally watched it last night, not having the slightest idea what it was or what it was about. What I got was a heart-warming, beautifully drawn and - well - decidely odd animated film from Japan<br/><br/>Two young Japanese sisters and their father move into a run-down shack in a rice-field area where they meet several ""fairy tale"" characters lving in the local woods, including the titular, Totoro, a giant - erm - gerbil. While having adventures with him and his smaller friends, they discover that their hospitalised Mother, due home soon, has developed an illness. The younger sister runs away to find the hospital and Totoro assists in the search<br/><br/>Whether this Totoro is a well known character in Japan (like - what? - the tooth fairy, or Father Christmas over here) or not I'm afraid I don't know. But the film is presented in such a way that you should know who the hell these characters are<br/><br/>Now, as an adult, I found the film very touching. The fact that it was in Japanese with English sub-titles didn't bother me. But its obvious intended audience (i.e my children) would be hard pressed to sit through it purely because of that reason; however, the simple tale of innocent children exploring their new locations is one that should and, indeed, would appeal to my younger boys<br/><br/>I must confess that I didn't share my friend's obvious joy in finding such a film - but then I wouldn't expect him to sit through my favourite ""Krull"" every month or so.

","While I'm not a huge anime fan, I've slowly becoming one and have had the pleasure of seeing some fabulous anime, including ""My Neighbor Totoro"". Loved all over the world, this is an animated film that's perfect for kids and adults of all ages.  This is also a must-see for anyone who is interested in Japanese animation, as it's one of the classics, along with ""Akira"" and ""Princess Mononoke"".<br/><br/>The movie begins with two little girls and their father moving into an old house in the Japanese countryside, while their mother is in a nearby hospital recovering from an undisclosed illness.  Five-year old Mei and Satsuki, her older sister (about 10), help their father fix the house up, along with several of their neighbors.  The girls' father is a professor at the university and leaves Mei in the care of Nanny, the elderly woman next door, while Satsuki is at school.  When school is over, Satsuki and Mei are alone until their father comes home late at night.  One day, Mei follows some tiny creatures into a forest where she meets Totoro, a huge, furry, teddy bear-like creature.  Both girls befriend him and when they need help, Totoro is right there.<br/><br/>Mr. Miyazaki is a genius when it comes to portraying children in their most pure form.  Both girls are rowdy and loud and are very realistic for animated characters.  There are many charming scenes including my favorite where Mei captures a dustbunny and runs off to find Satusuki.  She bumps into Nanny for the first time and screams in fright, then runs around the door to get away.  She then bumps into Nanny again and screams.  It's an adorable scene, I can't do it justice here.  The animation is very fluid and the characters move like real people.  Just watch how Mei toddles around with her chubby legs bowed outwards, like a real pre-schooler.<br/><br/>As much as I loved this movie, there's one key element I wasn't fond of: Totoro himself.  He seemed more menacing than harmless, especially when he roared directly in the girls' faces, baring his huge teeth.  Small children may find the noise frightening.  Granted it is a cartoon, but Totoro looked like he was abusing illegal substances and acted like he was, too.  I found nothing about Totoro charming; he was just one creepy critter.  His bizarre behavior is probably more noticeable to older viewers, though, as children may be more in awe of the huge furry guy.<br/><br/>Here's a few notes for parents who might be questioning whether this is a good movie for their child.  ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is great as a small lesson in Japanese culture.  Some tidbits: The huge rice paddies, the family bathing together as a bonding activity, the fact that shoes are not worn indoors (watch Satsuki walk around on her knees).  If your child can handle Disney's ""Bambi"", this movie will be a piece of cake.  There are a few minor parts parents may be concerned about, including the very unsafe operation of a bicycle and the childrens' emotional distress in several situations. These are all very minor and shouldn't interfere with anyone's enjoyment of this classic anime film.  A 9/10."

As I'm sure you've already read in the countless reviews, Totoro tells the story of two country children coming across magical creatures called totoro.  As always, the animation is gorgeous, beautifully fluid and expressive and (unlike many American animated films) not over-animated.  Although Totoro may lack in slam-bang action, I recommend it to anybody who is a fan of other Miyazaki films, animation in general, or an innocent, beautiful story that reminds us that we still possess that innocence."

","Totoro joins a very small group of children's films which leave no nagging doubts that they might be bad for your kids to view repeatedly.  Disney features constantly equate physical deformity with evil; Power Rangers teach that ugly people are evil AND need a good kicking; Pokemon considers that your kids have no attention span and need to be electro-shocked with constant stroboscopic, primary-coloured violence.  Totoro preserves a magical simplicity which allows both the wonderment of child-like innocence and imaginary friends, and the doting of parents touched by such carefree marvelling.  Everything in this film can be viewed through the eyes of the children or their parents, and such thematised appreciation of multiple audiences makes Disney's formula of anthropomorphised cuddly things throwing occasionally suggestive remarks at the older viewer seem cynically contrived.  The Disney approach divides the audience in young and old, sneaking mild innuendo over the kids' heads and allowing the adults a sneaky smirk every now and then - Totoro is a joint viewing experience for parent and child, and has a message for both.  I'm glad its been so well received in America and in the few places it has been seen in the UK.  I was worried at first that it might be too slow for some children, and Totoro's appearances are few and fleeting.  This is amongst the finest family films ever made, and I want to make babies just so they can see it.  A little help, anyone?"

","well let me put it like this. im a 30 year old mature student and even my best friends criticise me for being too cynical. i hate disney and i prefer films and books that are more bleak and realistic. whilst i love films i hate 'movies' and i think that if the best thing that anybody can say about a film is that 'it is a mindless diversion' then to me that says that they are mindless.<br/><br/>and yet, and yet i couldnt stop myself from loving this film. this is obviously a fact that i wont tell everyone about (i have my hardcore hate the world reputation to keep up). but this was just a great film. of course i kidded myself that i only liked it because it was by the legend 'miyazaki' but in reality it was because it was a great film. it was free of the cloying setimentality that obscures most (very nearly all) childrens films. it was also free from the grotesque stereotypes that disney perpetrates in its quest to turn children into consumers.<br/><br/>if you have kids (not that i do) or if you are still a kid (erm...i'll think that i shall pass no comment here) then do yourself a favour and forget the weather and the bills and the demands and the news and all of that adult rubbish. sit back and be entertained. you know, i may even get this on dvd too...for my nephew and niece of course..."

Miyazaki is simply an amazing guy, and his Totoro, are cute, adorable and so, so cool!<br/><br/>Apart from the Totoro themselves, there's the hilarious Cat Bus, and the undeniably sweet kid sister, Mei, who's the only one who can see the Totoro at first.<br/><br/>Unlike Disney movies, Miyazaki never preaches to his audience, nor does he pander to the lowest common denominator. What you get, is a sweet, funny, and funny adventure that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.<br/><br/>For a 2D film to make you just curl-up on the sofa, and think that ""life can't get any better than this"", then watch this film.

(I suppose he hadn't known that Katsuhiro Ohtomo's ""Akira"" had suffered such a fate.)<br/><br/> Nonetheless, this is a wonderful movie, despite the voice-overs by Saturday-morning rejects.  I was disappointed to hear Roger Ebert (who generally liked the film) characterize the children in the film as ""saccharine sweet.""  It seems Americans have become so accustomed to smart-mouthed brats on TV and in movies that when they see children on the screen actually behaving like children, they seem ""saccharine sweet.""

The simple storyline is given to the viewer instead of rammed down his/her throat. The feeling you get whilst watching just makes you want to wrap yourself in a massive thick warm blanket, and wander into the snow and watch the clouds go by.

","Tonari no Totoro holds a special place among all the animated movies I had ever watched as the movie that makes me remember what's it like to be a child again. Totoro reminds us what it feels to see the world around us as a child, where everything is new, fresh, and exciting.  This movie also contains some of the best scenes ever created in an Anime.  There is a lot of HEART in this movie.  It is also clear that rather than designing the visuals for the sake of merely making them look pretty/ appealing, the designers uses their sensitivity to convey how interesting the world looks from their point of view.  This results in a movie that connects to the audience in so many ways.  This movie certainly has the charm and ""magic"" that had been lost in so many recent animated features. I highly recommend this movie."
"shawndevin","9","0","1","9 May 2001"," Beautiful animation.
","This film has some of the most beautiful and realistic animation I have ever seen.  Many of the backgrounds are so well painted that they like they are photographs.  I was told that after the violence and mass destruction in his previous film `Tenku no shiro Rapyuta' (`Castle in the Sky: Laputa'), mothers in Japan were distressed that they had taken their very young children to see the film thinking it was going to be just a kiddy film. Supposedly, this film is his response to their outrage.  This is the kiddy film to beat all kiddy films.  There is no villain in this film.  None.  In spite of that, the story does not suffer at all.  I personally found the story to be quite charming, very entertaining and totally unique.  I must confess however, that I cannot stand the American voices used in the English dub of this film.  If you have a chance to watch it in the original Japanese with subtitles I strongly encourage it."

"redneck-6","10","0","1","25 September 2000"," Lighthearted, but intelligent look at the world through childrens' eyes.
","Classifying this as mere anime and thinking that fans of anime are the only people who might enjoy this film doesn't really do it justice at all.  It's a beautifully simple tale that intelligently mixes lighthearted whimsy with serious subject matter, managing to entertain without being trite or patronizing to adults or children. Two girls move with their father to the countryside to be near the hospital where their mother is recovering from a serious illness.  They meet and befriend magical creatures living under a giant tree on the hill next to their home, the Totoros, who in subtle and gentle ways help the girls deal with the worry and confusion of being separated from their mother.  Adults will see a tale about what it's like to be a child in a world that can be sometimes wondrous and sometimes mean, and children will love the girls' adventures with the adorable Totoros.  The Totoros themselves come in different sizes and look somewhat like a cross between a cat, a bear, and a rabbit.  They are charged with keeping the natural world in order and perform duties such as making the wind blow and seeds sprout from the ground. The film is not afraid to take a slow serene pace and concentrate on seemingly unimportant background details such as trees, clouds, and streams. The rural surroundings that the story takes place in (Japan in the 1950's) are so lovingly rendered and intricately detailed that I found myself wishing I could visit and stay for a while. As a parent, I couldn't find anything in the film remotely unsuitable for children.  The world the girls inhabit, while at times sad, is filled with friends and caring adults who actually cherish the childrens' innocence. And while not only being entertaining for children, its gentle treatment of its mature subject matter may very well wind up serving as a starting point for discussion of coping with sadness or other negative emotions.  I believe anyone who can remember what it was like to be a child will find something to enjoy here, and I look forward very much to seeing more of Mr. Miyazaki's work.<br/><br/>(please note that I viewed the dubbed version released by Fox some years ago)"

Fortunately, however, it was an absolutely brilliant one:  ""My Neighbour Totoro"".<br/><br/>If you ever hear about this being shown on the big screen, grab tickets immediately;  if not, get it on video.

The visual style is very similar to some of Tenchi Muyo (which was probably heavily influenced by My Neighbour Totoro), for those of you familiar with that.  It's one of the few where the dubbed version is as good as the subbed, too;  the English language voice acting is magnificent."

","Why. Oh, why must Disney be so... I don't know... predictable or formulaic. This  is why I love this children's anime film so much!<br/><br/>""My Neighbor Totoro"" is about two girls whom move out to the country in Japan. Soon they meet a forest sprit named Totoro. Now Totoro is responsible for the growth of the trees, the flow of the wind, and the nature's actions in general. He looks like a huge cute creature across from a cat, a bear, and most of all-an owl. Every once in a while he is accompanied by smaller versions of himself and a twelve-legged cat that acts as a bus. Together they go on small adventures flying through the woods and making plants grow. However, this is only is a backdrop to the movie as Totoro does not hog the plot.<br/><br/>Truthful, this film is looked in the girls' perspective as they experience their joyful youth and fears like dealing with their mother's absence-whom is ill and at hospital. It makes me wonder if the adventures with Totoro are partly imaginary. Mmm... does it matter? No. This is just a perfect flick that proves that children films can be intelligent while being fully entertaining.<br/><br/>""Totoro"" is drawn beautifully with vivid colours and photo-realistic scenes. This film is a directed by Hayao Miyazaki who is huge in Japan. Disney has recently picked up some his movies to be distributed here in the States like ""Kiki Delivery Service"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" (this is not one of them; this is from Fox-Video). Therefore, Disney might be on the way of doing more profound films and stripping away the tired formula. Amen."

I really wish Hayao Miyazaki's films were more readily avalible in the US, I've yet to see a less than amazing film by this master animator.  I really hope the theatrical release of the masterpiece Princess Mononoke (which I've only been able to see on video) causes people to check out this and other Miyazaki films.  The film contains some wonderful, hilarious moments like when the Totoro discovers how to use an umbrella, and the ""catbus"".  The score by Joe Hisaishi is very good too, along with Ryuichi Sakamoto (The Last Emperor), Akira Ifukube (Godzilla), Masaru Sato (Yojimbo), and Toru Takemitsu (Ran), Hisaishi is my favorite Japanese film composer.<br/><br/>I highly reccomend this film for both children and adults, if I had children, I would definitely show it to them.  I would show them there's more to animation than cheesy 30 minute toy commercials.  If we were living in a more perfect world, this is what would be showing instead of Pokemon: The First Movie.  And adults, don't feel silly renting this for yourself. Even though i'm an adult, I never for a moment felt silly watching this film.  The same goes for other very good animated films that are supposedly for kids, like Toy Story 2 and Nick Park's wonderful Wallace and Gromit shorts.  The Fox/Streamline English-dubbed version is very good, way better than most English dubs of anime.  This version is good to show to younger kids who may have trouble following subtitles.  Still, I really hope this film gets released on DVD someday and has the original Japanese language track.
