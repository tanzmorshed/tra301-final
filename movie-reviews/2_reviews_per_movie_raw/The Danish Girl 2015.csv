","Because of the subject matter in The Danish Girl I wasn't sure this was going to be a film that I would particularly like but I need not have have worried because I thought this was a fascinating movie that justified it's plaudits. This is the story of Danish artist Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) who realised that despite being born a man he is really a woman and that woman is called Lile. Although Redmayne will quite obviously get all the praise for his role as Lile but I think the outstanding performance of this film comes from Alicia Vikander who plays his wife. As an actor she is exposed unlike Redmayne who has the make up to hide behind. Instead of being about Lile this film for me is more about the love of his wife who will do anything to make her husband happy. Even if that means losing him. in the process."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","32","39","30 January 2016"," Excellent Performances from the Two Leads
","The Danish Girl (2015)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The semi true-story of painters Einar (Eddie Redmayne) and Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander), a married couple who find their lives changing when Einar dresses as a woman so Gerda can have someone to paint but it brings something out in him. Soon Einar is going around as the Lili character and soon decides that he's a woman on the inside.<br/><br/>THE DANISH GIRL is another beautiful looking film from Tom Hooper, the director best known for his Oscar-winner THE KING'S SPEECH. Like that film the director has no problem with the visual look of the film and Hooper certainly knows how to put you in the period setting. It also doesn't hurt that we've got some excellent performances and a rather interesting and conflicted love story.<br/><br/>I think the real draw here are the performances with Redmayne once again delivering a remarkable piece of work just a year after his Oscar win for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. A lot of actors have played male/female characters to perfection. In my mind the greatest was Dustin Hoffman in TOOTSIE but that there was a comedy whereas this here certainly isn't. It was really remarkable seeing how well Redmayne played both the male and female character and he was certainly believable as both. Whenever the Lili character was on screen you really did feel as if you were watching an actress and not just a man playing a female. Vikander is also excellent as the woman who finds the man she love slowly turning into someone else.<br/><br/>The film features some beautiful cinematography, a great music score and I also thought the screenplay was very good. The story itself drags a tad bit during the first portion but I think it asks a lot of really good questions about what love is and of course what one feels about who they really are. I thought the flow of the film was quite good and there's no question that it nails the costume design and sets. THE DANISH GIRL isn't a masterpiece but it's certainly a very good movie with some excellent performances."
"tuco73","5","209","303","9 December 2015"," Great story, good effort, but poor result
","The story could have been very dramatic and deeply touching, as it is a true story of both the internal conflicts of a man and the deep love of a woman to her partner. Unfortunately the meticulous attention to image rather than screenplay (to me) resulted in a quite cold and un- engaging movie, where beautiful costumes, interiors and landscapes are the only highlights. I found that even the acting of the brilliant young Eddie Redmayne was not that good, as his constant smiles and shy blinking eyes after a while seem to be the only stratagem he has to portray such a complex character (and after the first dozen of them I couldn't stand it anymore). A more sophisticated psychological portrait of the main character and a more dramatic rendition of his/her troubled soul would have given more solidity to a movie which seems too superficial."
"bob-the-movie-man","7","77","106","4 January 2016"," Vikander shines but overall it didn't connect with me as expected
","The new cinema year has got off to a robust start with the new movie from Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech"", ""Les Misérables""). <br/><br/>We have seen many depictions of physical torture on the screen over the years, from the interminable teen-slasher pics, through 'that chair scene' in ""Casino Royale"" to the stylized presentations of Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese in films like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Casino"". ""The Danish Girl"" is also in its way a film about torture, but more akin to the mental torture seen in films like ""Buried"" or ""Flightpath"". What must it be like to be trapped with a sexual orientation that you feel is not your own? To possess physical body parts you don't believe you should have? And all in a time (the 1920's) when an exposed ankle was considered slightly daring.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne (""The Theory of Everything"") and Alicia Vikander (""Ex Machina"") play a bohemian married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, apparently happily married and trying for a child in 1920's Copenhagen. Einar is a renowned landscape artist with his wife a struggling portrait artist living in his shadow. After taking part in a cross-dressing modelling session, strong feelings are awakened in Einar. As a bit of a 'game' Gerda encourages him to explore the character of his alter-ego ""Lili"" further: a big mistake, as Einar is swept into a spiral of confusion and self-doubt.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne is surely up for another Oscar-nomination for his brave performance as Einar/Lili, using his expressive eyes to great effect and delivering a truly heart-rending performance. With all this said however, I never quite believed I was watching the character of Lili but more Redmayne acting the character. Perhaps this is unfair, as Einar/Lili is such a bizarrely multi-dimensional person no one could perhaps have played him/her to my satisfaction. But I suspect (particularly as Redmayne won last year) this won't bring Redmayne the Oscar double. <br/><br/>Far more impressive for me was the delicious and delightful Alicia Vikander, once more turning in a fantastic performance as the increasingly desperate (both psychologically and sexually) Gerda. With Rooney Mara, Vikander must be one of the brightest actress talents in today's cinema. <br/><br/>Also turning in a strong performance, in what is a very limited cast list, is Matthias Schoenaerts (""Far from the Madding Crowd"") as a Parisian art dealer with a link to Einar's past. The omni-present (sorry, that should read ""hard-working"") Ben Whishaw turns up again as a party guest with an unhealthy interest in Lili and Sebastian Koch (most recently seen in series 5 of ""Homeland"") plays Dr Warnekros who is a pioneer in the new and risky business of sexual reassignment surgery.<br/><br/>Another star of the film is the luscious Danish capital, filmed in vibrant colours, as if from the artists' palettes, by Danny Cohen, a Hooper favourite. Also a big surprise to me was the gloriously photographed Danish countryside, seen at the end of the film, with mountains and seascapes I never knew existed.<br/><br/>Another Hooper alumni, Alexandre Desplat, supplies the soupy but very fitting score.<br/><br/>While the film features a compelling story and much impressive acting, I never personally felt as connected to the story as I was to ""The King's Speech"". This isn't helped by a rather stagy script by Lucinda Coxon that feels lightweight at times. Perhaps its because we are in Oscar- season but, to me, it all felt a tad pretentious and (no pun intended) could have done with a few snips in places to reduce the running time by 15 minutes or so. That being said, and as an alternative view, I should point out that my wife was in tears for a good proportion of the film and disagrees vehemently with my views. I say ""my wife"", but since watching the film she's started wearing braces and smoking cigars – so I'm rather confused as to WHAT exactly is going on. :-)<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review, see bob-the-movie-man.com.

"dave-mcclain","6","56","76","21 December 2015"," ""The Danish Girl"" is a very touching, but controversial and oversimplified story.
","""He's comfortable in his own skin,"" is usually seen as a compliment. It means that the person in question knows who he (or she) is and is content with that sense of identity. I dare speculate that it's a condition to which we all aspire. Unfortunately, many people around the world lack that inner peace because of a question of gender identity. Regardless of what others think about such an existential situation, people who feel uncomfortable with the biology with which they were born often suffer greatly over this conflict within their hearts and minds. They cannot be comfortable in their own skin, because they don't feel that their skin is really theirs. Before the somewhat more enlightened times of the 21st century, people who identified with a gender other than that to which biology assigned them suffered even more than some do today. In ages past, those people had little opportunity to make changes that would make themselves look on the outside as they felt on the inside. ""The Danish Girl"" (R, 2:00) is one such story.<br/><br/>Inspired by the true story of early 20th century married Danish painters Einar and Gerda Wegener, like David Ebershoff's 2000 book on which it's based, ""The Danish Girl"" is a fictionalized account of Einar's physical transition to Lili Elbe. Neither the book nor Lucinda Coxon's screenplay makes any claim to absolute historical accuracy. This story changes many of the facts for dramatic purposes. The real-life situation of Lili and Gerda's life was much more complicated than we see on screen. The result is a film that tells a simple story in a way that elicits empathy for the protagonists and enlightens the audience.<br/><br/>Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne plays Einar/Lili, and Alicia Vikander, his wife, Gerda. The couple lives in a large apartment in Copenhagen, Denmark, where they both make a living painting. At first, Einar's landscapes are more in demand and more respected than Gerda's portraits. One day when Gerda was in a hurry to finish a portrait of their mutual friend and ballerina, Oola (Amber Heard), Gerda asks Einar to stand in as a model by putting on Oola's stockings and heels and holding up Oola's dress in front of him. Although the scene is played with a combination of humor and awkwardness, it's obvious that Einar likes the clothes. He starts trying on his wife's clothes which gives birth to an idea. Gerda is a bit conflicted, but being the open-minded person she is, she suggests that her husband dress up as a woman to attend an art world function that he had been trying to avoid. And just like that, Lili is born.<br/><br/>The thing is that Einar had always felt like a female and being Lili was the first opportunity that he had really had to express what he felt was his true gender. Einar wears women's clothes and make-up more and more often, both at home and out in public. Lili even begins secretly seeing a local man named Henrik (Ben Whishaw). Gerda is understandably upset by all this, but she never criticizes her husband's inner turmoil or its outward manifestations. She wants to understand, and the more she does, the more she mourns her marriage, which she sees as slipping away. However, as all this is happening, her art career begins to take off. She paints Lili more and more, in fashionable clothes and in little or no clothes. As Gerda's style develops, increasing demand for her paintings soon leads the couple to move to Paris.<br/><br/>In Paris, Lili blossoms as a person, even as she seeks a more permanent solution to her feeling that her biology doesn't match her identity. She sees doctors whose diagnoses are wide-ranging, but are mainly focused on Einar/Lili having some sort of mental deficiency. Hans Axgil (Matthias Schoenarts), a childhood friend of Einar, tries to help, but he can do little more than offer moral support to the couple. Finally, Lili and Gerda find a possible solution in the person of German doctor Kurt Warnekros (Sebastian Koch). Dr. Warnekros offers to perform practically unprecedented sex reassignment surgery on Lili.<br/><br/>""The Danish Girl"" is a very sensitive portrayal of a very tumultuous experience in the lives of two real people. Whether you sympathize with the situation of the two main characters or not, you're likely to empathize with them as people. While presenting a story about the controversial topic of gender identity, Oscar-winning director Tom Hooper also tells a very human story within the framework of the movie's plot. At its core, this is a tale of love and loss, of tolerance and devotion, of feeling comfortable in one's own skin. Although some Movie Fans may find some of the situations, images and the brief but graphic nudity (both female and male) to be disturbing, and the plot does drag at times, one of the main reasons to see this movie is for the award-worthy performances by the two leads. With impressive emotional range and depth, both Redmayne and Vikander make this story surprisingly rich and relatable. Hooper draws even more focus (literally) to the characters' feelings by choosing especially significant moments to bring his camera in very close for a tight focus on the characters' faces, while allowing everything beyond their necks to go out of focus. ""The Danish Girl"" deserves credit for its honesty, its emotional power and its succinct presentation of a very complicated story. However, some of the changes in the story seem designed to increase the impact of the story, a move I would call emotionally manipulative. For that and other reasons, I just wish that this otherwise excellent film had been more historically accurate. ""B"""
"namashi_1","7","60","84","29 December 2015"," Very Well-Acted, Although Flawed!
","Tom Hooper's 'The Danish Girl' is a brave story, about brave people, in a time where their bravery must've been counted as mental illness. Hooper chooses the correct actors to portray the parts & directs the film with dignity. However, The Writing doesn't always engage & is flawed in places.<br/><br/>'The Danish Girl' is A fictitious love story inspired by the lives of Danish artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. Lili and Gerda's marriage and work evolve as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a transgender pioneer.<br/><br/>'The Danish Girl' salutes the courageous lives of Lili Elbe & Gerda Wegener. Both of whom who died too early, had the courage to be themselves, especially Lilli, who chose to express rather than being repressed. And Gerda, a women who had to face the reality, was a women who respected her husband's truth. That was True Romance!<br/><br/>But, 'The Danish Girl' isn't as tightly Written it should have been. Lucinda Coxon's Screenplay, which is based on the 2000 novel of the same name by David Ebershoff, is powerful, but in doses. The first-hour works wonders, but the second-hour slows down & the flaws in the Writing show up. The final-act, to put it bluntly, isn't half as emotionally moving as it deserved to be. In short, the Writing lets 'The Danish Girl' down, at some parts.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper's Direction is dignified. He has handled some of the most dramatic scenes, with great conviction. Danny Cohen's Cinematography is nicely done. Melanie Ann Oliver's Editing is perfectly sized. Art & Costume Design are fabulous. Alexandre Desplat's Score is enchanting. A Special Mention for the nearly done Make-Up.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Eddie Redmayne as Lili Elbe & Alicia Vikander as Gerda Wegener, deliver brilliant performances. Eddie, fresh from his Oscar-Win this year, strikes back with a yet another winning performance, thats both, brave & heartbreaking. Vikander is splendid as his wife, who conveys her pain, with concern & sensitivity. And the on-screen chemistry between the two, is wonderful. Ben Whishaw & Amber Heard are terrific in supporting roles.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'The Danish Girl' isn't as good as one expects it to be, but its well-directed & very well-acted nonetheless!"
"zhongzl-kelley2014","9","48","66","25 December 2015"," Every frame is an oil painting
","This film melted me like the touch of silk. Although I wasn't fully convinced of the transformation of Einar Wegener, I am deeply touched by the Eddie Redmayne's fragile beauty as a women(or should I say Lily). He comprehends Einar's psychological conditions perfectly, and every twist of his facial muscles or movements of his eyes demonstrate the perfect empathy he has for his role. I don't care about logical consistency of plots or the point of view as long as he is the center of images, he flawlessly convinces me that Einar sincerely believe that he is born to be a woman. And as long as his feelings are as burning and heart-felt as reflected in my eyes, there's nothing to criticize about whether his decisions are morally right or wrong.<br/><br/>It's spirit-shattering that Einar died in the arms of Gerda, and Gerda did an extraordinary job in supporting her husband. I would give Alicia Vikander a full score too, her performance reconstruct perfectly a open-minded female artist that has unconditional love for her husband. She forsook the obscure love she had for Hans, the right to be protected and caressed as a wife, and everything women think they rightfully deserves from their husbands. Einar said before he died: ""How would I ever deserve such love?""Seeing him pale like a vampire, watching his hand sliding from her hand, it's hard to imagine the heartbreak Gerda had. Would she blame herself for not forcing Einar to the doctors instead of ""indulging his hallucinations?"" Would she blame herself for letting her husband wear her silk pajamas and ballet dress for her own artistic career? Would she miss the man that looks to her eyes in the morning and whisper to her:""My life, my wife.""? I drained my tears for her anyway. Gerda is such a wonderful woman.<br/><br/>I also feel obliged to comment on the institutionalization at that time. The idiot psychiatrist can't even figure out the difference between schizophrenia and a healthy man. One of the psychiatrist even proposed a lobotomy, and at the wrong spot. Lobotomy is supposed to sever the connection between frontal lobe and the rest of the brain to treat those who get major depression or anxiety disorder and don't react to medical treatment, the technique it is abandoned in the modern world for its inhumane side effects. Stupidity of the doctor reflects their ossified believes about trans gender people and their lack of professional knowledge, which explains how hard it was for Einar to defend his faith and for Gerda to stick to the belief that her husband was not insane.<br/><br/>Except for the fascinating acting skills, I really really really adore the lighting and color of the film. I can proudly hang every frame of the movie on my bedroom wall(except the scene Einar showed his male parts, maybe), and proclaim them art pieces. Harmony of colors and subjects, like oil painting, is the best solution for a film that is filled by sentimental transformations. Or it would easily fall into the trap of melodramatic depiction or confusion of emotions. But better than A Girl With a Pearl Earring, this film is consolidated by subtle facial expressions of actors and actresses, which clearly present the inner struggles of characters.<br/><br/>For conclusion, I love this films and the techniques are perfect. But I find it difficult to agree with Einar. He burdened Hans, Gerda, pained them emotionally, and even caused his own death, because he wanted to have a female body? Is it the ability to have sex as a woman that's more important, or is it his and his loved ones' welfare that comes in priority? Let's leave it to everyone's own judgment."
"Jerghal","8","24","32","28 February 2016"," Solid acting and great cinematography
","Though it is nominated for 4 Oscars I wasn't looking forward to seeing it. The Danish Girl seemed like the typical arty-farty Oscar fare on paper but fortunately it was better than that. The best part of the film is the acting. Eddy Redmane does a great job but I was most surprised by Alicia Vikander. She almost steals the movie though she only has a supporting role. Mattias Schoenaerts is also in it with a supporting role and I must say: that man can do just about any language and accent and make it sound completely natural. The story was not that interesting to me and is somewhat of a typical subject matter for Oscar movies (that is movies about some sort of misunderstood minority and who was the first to start the revolution if you will). That being said, it is a very good movie, superb acting but on the other hand I don't consider this a must see."
"flickernatic","5","53","77","4 January 2016"," Cold as a Copenhagen winter
","Set in Copenhagen in the mid-1920s, this film tells the story of the first person to undergo gender reassignment surgery, a story which does not, sadly, have a happy ending. Einar Wegener, a Danish painter, has been married to a fellow-artist, Gerda for six years. Gradually he becomes obsessed with the idea of becoming a woman, a quest which leads him to submit to untried medical procedures which eventually prove fatal.<br/><br/>It does not take much imagination to appreciate how challenging it must be to find oneself stuck in the 'wrong' body and impelled to rectify this situation by resort to surgery. Perils loom on all sides - the physical risks, the psychological anguish, the threats to personal relationships, the fear of social ostracism or worse - and smooth passage seems improbable. How much more so given the state of medical and psychological knowledge in the 1920s and a less liberal moral climate than prevails today. Surely such a prospect must make for rich and vibrant drama. Yet, despite its dramatic potential, the Wegeners' story is given such a flat treatment by Tom Hooper that the movie verges on boring at times.<br/><br/>A bleak note is struck from the start and continued with little respite. The mood is cold and gloomy, emphasised by the colourless, sparely-furnished interiors (light-grey walls in their apartment, harsh white wall tiles in the clinics and consulting rooms - only when Gerda visits Paris do we see some gorgeous period interiors), the bare wintry landscapes of Copenhagen, and the minor-key music. The tempo is one-paced and the dialogue is often stilted and dreary. Can this really be someone engaged in a momentous struggle with their identity and, consequently, with their personal relationships and their position in society? Indeed, when Einar first steps out into the world as Lili, she seems barely noticed by those around her despite looking far from convincing as a female.<br/><br/>Einar and Gerda never explore with each other in any sustained way what is happening to him and its implications for their relationship. Partly because of this we get little understanding of Einar's self-perception, little sense of his insights into his condition. Similarly, we don't encounter the desperation of someone in crisis except very late on when Einar is battling with the immediate after-effects of his operations. Mercifully, we are spared visual details of his exposure to the surgeon's scalpel.<br/><br/>The lead characters are surprisingly one-dimensional and seem to be narrowly self-obsessed. The emotional range is equally constrained for while we witness neediness, longing and lust, there is no real passion, no sense of warm affection or love between Gerda and her husband. Nor do we see real anger displayed, despite there being much for the characters to be angry about. Lili's quest for transformation seems to bring no one any lasting pleasure.<br/><br/>The exaggerated and awkward manner that Eddie Redmayne brought to the character of Stephen Hawking, and which worked brilliantly there, does not really do so here. Instead it proves a distraction. Lili repeatedly responds to male attention with little more than shy downward glances and simpering expressions which become rather embarrassing to watch. Perhaps only a more accomplished actor than Redmayne could carry off this highly demanding role successfully. Alicia Vikander does much better as Gerda but cannot shine so brightly in Redmayne's shadow.<br/><br/>There is clearly plenty of talent associated with this film and the story of the Wegeners seems worth telling. But this movie fails to hit the mark.<br/><br/>Viewed at Home (successor to The Cornerhouse), Manchester, UK, 03.01.16."
"letig1994","8","129","202","6 September 2015"," Touching and destabilizing
","I honestly found this movie very touching and delicate. It is delicate in the way it treats difficult subjects as sexuality and the discovery of one's identity in an hostile period. The fact that it is a true story makes the whole movie even more involving.<br/><br/>I don't think the film is perfect - but the acting, cinematography, the screenplay are absolutely amazing. I especially loved the middle part - where all the characters try to find a way out of the problem and when for the first time they seem to be facing a fracture between them.<br/><br/>I thought it had a great power on people even though it doesn't seem to have had the effect I was expecting (at least during the premiere in Venice).<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne hasn't had enough of his Oscar and I wish him all the best for 2016!"

","'The Danish Girl' is an extremely well made film with two outstanding lead performances from Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander. Everything about the film has a sophisticated, elegant feel, from the constume design to the atmosphere and cinematography. This is a classy film.<br/><br/>Although, in a way, this is to the film's detriment. The story is almost told with a mask on, it's difficult to see beyond the flawless surface and connect emotionally with the film.

"Anurag-Shetty","9","23","33","21 January 2016"," A heartbreaking love story.
","The Danish Girl is a movie loosely based on the life of Danish artists, Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe(Eddie Redmayne) & Gerda Wegener(Alicia Vikander). Einar & Gerda are a happily married couple. Einar is the more accomplished artist, between the two of them. Gerda paints portraits & Einar paints landscapes. Gerda is frustrated because her portraits don't get sold, quite as often as she would like them to. One day, she makes Einar dress up like a woman. Gerda does this because, she wants to paint a portrait of Einar as a woman. Gerda & Einar come up with the name Lili Elbe, for Einar's alter ego. Gerda's Lili portraits are a huge success. What Gerda did not expect is, Einar feels extremely drawn to Lili & sinks more & more into Lili's personality as the days go by. <br/><br/>The Danish Girl is a fantastic film! The love shared between Gerda & Einar has been depicted beautifully, by director Tom Hooper. It is gut wrenching to see Gerda slowly lose her husband, as Einar soon realizes that Lili Elbe is, who he was always meant to be. Apart from the flawless & poignant story, this film has showcased exotic locales. Copenhagen & Paris, where the majority of the movie takes place, have been showcased beautifully. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Alicia Vikander is spectacular as Gerda Wegener. Vikander's multifaceted portrayal of her character, is the best part of the film. Eddie Redmayne is brilliant as Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe. Redmayne emulates the gait & mannerisms of a woman, to the T. Redmayne gives another memorable performance after The Theory of Everything(2014). However, Alicia Vikander outshines Eddie Redmayne, in every way possible. She carries the emotional weight of the film, on her shoulders. Amber Heard is impressive as Ulla. Ben Whishaw is great as Henrik. Matthias Schoenaerts is superb as Hans Axgil. Sebastian Koch is awesome as Warnekros. The supporting cast is good too. The Danish Girl is a must watch. It's an inspiration to transgender people, all over the world."
"paulmcuomo","3","42","73","2 January 2016"," I honestly was hoping for more pretentiousness
","I wanted to write a review of this movie, slamming its pretentiousness and hurling tons of allegory onto its maximum levels of Oscar-Bait that the trailer for this movie strained really hard to get across with all of its criteria: the contemporary message of love for the trans community, the good actors, the period-drama setting, the operatic score. Instead, however, I come to tell of a movie that is so emotionally lacking, so frustratingly distant, and so boring, which is in a way the biggest disappointment for me.<br/><br/>To start off, the film's production design is strong. There was some over-saturation of the colours they use to show this unrealistically colourful world the character's live in, but the costumes are all interesting and engaging. The mis-en-scene and the editing, however, are a mess; Tom Hooper definitely shoots the environment better than his actors, as whenever a conversation is going on, he continually isolates each character to their own separate take and a camera that focuses in on actors with nothing to react to. This, combined with a continual lack of proper establishing shot, is a terrible choice of how to do the movie; I know he's trying to make them intimate to us, but he fails at making them intimate to each other and, as a result, the audience doesn't care. The editing's a confusing and weird one; there are a much of moments that make no sense. Firstly is a scene where Einar delivers laundry to a woman collecting it, but he does it with such insane speed it makes Usian Bolt look fat and slow (he has to run from one end of their big house to another, after having to tie the bag up tight) and it was so weird you wonder why they included it. Same with the scene where Gerda gets out of a full period costume, including big knee high leather boots, and into another one in the time it takes her husband to paint a smudge on his canvas. But by far the biggest ""why the hell"" with the editing is a shot when he's first becoming Lili, and it cuts to some water on the floor. There was literally no point except to confuse the audience.<br/><br/>Now onto the biggest issues with this movie - Eddie Redmayne, Alicia Vikander and the script. To start with Alicia, she's great. She honestly is, with both her body of work and her performance in this film as she tries to bring a complete range of colours and shades to this performance as she laughs, smiles, cries, and dances around. The problem is she's trying her damned hardest to add something to nothing. And let's get one thing straight here, this movie treats Gerda Wegener like dirt. She's not a successful artist, she only has a career/notice because of Einar before and after the creation of Lili, and she never, NEVER gets angry, to the point where its insulting as he selfishly pulls himself away from her and into Lili, leaving her absolutely alone. Except for one scene where she pleads with him - ""I need my husband. I want to hold my husband"", which is said out of frustration than anything else - she never speaks out on any of it, and when she does, he says one sentence then immediately shuts up. It's like the fantasy of what people hope for other people to be, rather than them actually being it - that scene where she first finds him wearing her nightgown and then immediately starts banging him is so insultingly, unrealistically forgiving that it hurt me. Mr Redmayne now. First of all, whilst I thought that he did do a good job in The Theory of Everything, I did think the Oscar was more appropriate in the hands of Michael Keaton or Jake Gyllenhaal. In this movie, I have the exact same issue as I did with that movie; he only tries with the difficult stuff i.e. the actually being a woman, or actually having Motor Neurone Disease, but the other times he is just a flat page delivering things awkwardly and not really acting. The problem with this is that his Stephen Hawking got ALS in the first 20 minutes of that film and he could really do his thing, but in this, he becomes a woman in the last 10 minutes. Those 10 minutes are wonderful, but it doesn't warrant an Oscar - or any award to be honest. He's a coy, fluttering, meek person who doesn't really change personally throughout the film beyond the physical nature of it. The script is full of lines that are over-shadowing the theme of the story, but not in a good way; lines like ""It was like I was kissing myself"" or ""I'm worried you'll look at that picture so long you'll disappear into it"" are cringy and not clever.<br/><br/>Apart from one scene in a Prostitute peep show, where Einar ends up mimicking the woman's movements as she observes and goes from weirded out to curious to understanding to sorry, the whole film grated for me badly. It's boring, distant and while it was just under 2 hours, I thought I'd been there longer<br/><br/>You want to go see it, be my guest. But if this wins an Oscar - especially for Best Actor, which something of this calibre doesn't warrant - then I hit the floor."
"kinolieber","3","142","288","16 September 2015"," The film equivalent of a coffee table book about Lili Elbe
","First the good: Alicia Vikander gives an excellent performance in a poorly written role. The music, when it's not loudly substituting for a decent script, is often lovely. And the historical context is illuminating, especially the very real danger of institutionalization. Other than that, what a mass of prestige picture clichés, laughably symmetrical camera set-ups and gorgeous landscape cinematography. And poor Eddie Redmayne. Completely out of his depth in the central role. Obviously, no one knows how well Lili Elbe passed for a woman, but no one, and I mean absolutely no one, would mistake Redmayne's Lili for anything else but an awkward, clumsy male in a bad wig. Granted, that would make an interesting take on this story: someone who believes they look like a woman but who doesn't. But that's not what this film proposes. Quite the opposite, which is why the audience consistently laughed every time the film suggested that Elbe herself, or other characters believed in the success of the transformation. The script is so cliché ridden and repetitious that even an actor as fine as Matthias Schoenaerts can't liven it up. And for some reason he is made up to look like a sweaty cadaver. And again,I felt bad for Mr. Redmayne, that he didn't get the directorial help he needed in the role and a better script that left him more to say than the trite and predictable lines in this one."

","""The Danish Girl"" is a beautiful package that came with plenty of anticipation. It is the story of a pioneer, an opportunity to showcase the talents of two talented performers, and had it been in the hands of a more capable team, it would have reached heights that very special films are able to attain.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with the performances of the leads. In fact, Redmayne might be even better than in his Oscar winning turn last year. Vikander continues to show she's an acting powerhouse. Her range is incredible, and she handles the drama and complexity of her role the way more experienced actors could. She and Redmayne work very well together, and it's a pity that even with all the other members of the team, the director has managed to give us a film that is even more frustrating than ""The King's Speech"". That film benefited from Firth and Carter's chemistry. This time, the themes are darker and more controversial, but they have been stiffled by the way an otherwise gorgeous score is constantly blaring and drowning the emotional life of the performances. Scene after scene we are ""cued"" to feel wonder, pity, sympathy, or whatever emotion the musical score is supposed to signal. It's a pity because if the music had not been there, the film would be very powerful.<br/><br/>Yet,it's not the only problem. The script seems scattered. Had it followed a more streamlined and straightforward path, it would have been better appreciated. Instead, the production relies too much on the gorgeous photography, the exquisite outfits, the sensitivity of the class these people belong to. Are they bohemians? Are they artists? Are they really talented? They are supposed to be free-spirits, but they certainly struggle with the different possibilities they encounter.<br/><br/>Redmayne conveys the torture and confusion nature has presented him with. He knows what he feels. Hopper makes sure we see him caressing the fine fabrics, but he remains sensitive and rarely achieves femininity the way those three actors were able to project in the farce ""Wong Foo"". Redmayne is way too classy. Still, his eyes can show pain, fear, and anxiety, and that certainly helps the film. One asset and a problem is his mate. She's powerful, expressive, can deliver lines with certainty and emotions. She shows loyalty, affection, love, lust, and confusion and matches Redmayne in just about every frame. Vikander steals the show.<br/><br/>There's much that is important here, and its power is lessened by the lack of confidence on the subject matter, and because we are constantly distracted by the aesthetics, forgetting what really matters is the bond, the souls, the hearts...<br/><br/>I missed the rawness of dialogue like McLaine's in ""Terms"". Life is not exquisite, is flawed, is full of pain and that makes the special moments precious. This is a showcase for performers of all types, but there is hardly any unity. It's that isolated masterpiece in the museum that we are supposed to admire, but we can hardly gather any true liking for it."

","I will begin by saying that I'm still debating whether I should give this movie 1 star to make up for all those high rated reviews. <br/><br/>As someone else stated in the comments, Eddie's character is so poorly researched, it's almost insulting to the trans community, I may not know a lot about this, but one does not dress in a costume as a favor and then identify themselves as another gender overnight... sure, the story wants to offer more background into this but fails to do to so at a satisfactory level. The main character comes across more likely to suffer from multiple personality disorder than being trans, and considering some less enlightened viewers still confuse sexual identity for pathology, this may be one of the most epic movie fails I have seen in years.<br/><br/>I should also add that the acting feels forced in some scenes, but that's mainly because many of those scenes are cliché so the actors don't have much to work with...... but man, if you've seen 10 movies in the past decade, the not-subtle-at-all foreshadowing will surely let you know how it ends.

Redmaynes character didn't develop for me at all and I couldn't see it improving if I'd stayed longer so 65 mins into it I followed several others who had left early and noticed one guy fast asleep. The core subject as stated in the trailers and posters is Redmayne's exploration of the femininity side of humanity. All well and good in a psychiatrists consultation but for a movie no. Had this been made for TV it could better be serialised. This is just my opinion but I was bored by it however most folk will watch it and rate it for it's acting merit - I rate for watchability."
"Radu_A","1","33","65","16 January 2016"," Trite, sentimental waste of an important subject
","A non-biographical biopic, ""The Danish Girl"" is one of the worst attempts at mainstreaming an LGBT-themed story I have ever had the displeasure to see. It takes far too many liberties with the real lives of its principal characters Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener, and reduces an interesting story and relationship to a superficial tear-jerker, albeit an excellently photographed one.<br/><br/>As in the book, Gerda Wegener's sexual identity is completely neglected, and Lili Elbe's transition is initially portrayed less than identity awakening and rather than role-play. Redmayne as Elbe is thoroughly miscast - it's really, really time by now to have trans parts played by trans people. He plays the character like an effeminate gay man, and if you have trans friends, you will understand how untrue that is. Vikander is doing OK with an underwritten role which shies away from the less romantic real story - for instance, Wegener was not present when Elbe died. Whishaw's character is completely superfluous. Sebastian Koch owes his presence to a big German contribution to the film's budget - still, the most interesting part of the story, the reassignment procedure he is carrying out, is dismissed by a sloppy, predictable script.<br/><br/>As some of you may know, there was an LGBT campaign to get ""Tangerine"" nominated for an Academy Award. That film is low budget, features actual Trans actresses and (almost) avoids cliché. If it wasn't for that fact, I would probably rate ""The Danish Girl"" a 4. But since it was actually nominated, it amounts to an insult of the LGBT community by an Academy consisting predominantly of white males in their 50s (there are also zero black nominees this year by the way). Some people seem to believe that any LGBT-themed movie is a good thing, even if it's as shallow as this one. But I see this kind of ""made for straight audiences award grabber"" as ignorant of the people it's supposed to be about - like ""Stonewall"", which forged a historic event to exclude trans women and drag queens. ""The Danish Girl"" is just as annoying and obsolete."

","The Danish Girl is directed by Tom Hooper and stars Academy Award Winner Eddie Redmayne, Alicia Vikander, Ben Whishaw and Matthias Schoenaerts. <br/><br/>Loosely inspired by Danish artists Gerda Wegener and Lili Elbe, The Danish Girl explores the marriage of Lili & Gerda as they experience Lili's ambitious journey as a transgender pioneer.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne returns to the screen with admirable strength and skill, with such a diverse character to play. He is as convincing as Lili Elbe as he was Stephen Hawking. With his incredible portrayal in The Theory Of Everything, capturing everyone and gaining major attention from critics and the Academy, Redmayne is an actor who has stepped into the spotlight for filmmakers. And respectfully so. His portrayal of Lili in this film is remarkable, well handled and instantly worthy of the recognition. He gives off an electrifying performance and very emotionally attaches himself to the personality of this character. A truly brilliant performance. Alicia Vikander is magnetic as Gerda, she just clicks. Again, a very emotional performance throughout. I do believe she deserves more attention from the critics than she's getting at the moment. These are two of the four outstanding factors of this film. <br/><br/>The third is the music by Alexandre Desplat. Absolutely beautiful piano melodies and string motifs as usual. He always writes with impeccable focus on the visuals and the touching performances on-screen. This is yet another score by Desplat that I will be happily purchasing.<br/><br/>The final pillar holding this film up is the visuals. The camera work is stunningly supportive of the story and screenplay. Slow, intimate and colourful.<br/><br/>Apart from these four points, I couldn't really attach myself to the film or its story. I felt it outstayed it's welcome after the 90 minute mark. If it were shorter by around 20-30 minutes I believe it would have flowed easier with less moments that felt out of place or less meaningful. Which is a bit sad when this is a story about such a compelling and controversial subject. It was handled with love and care but I didn't find myself feeling enthralled by anything particular. Don't get me wrong, it's very nicely written. But I wasn't deeply engaged as much as I should have been. It's a shame. I do, however, believe that it's a film that should be seen by everyone, and discussed beyond the award ceremonies. <br/><br/>My verdict; The Danish Girl is a piece of art in itself for its wonderful visuals, music and performances by Redmayne and Vikander. If a little more care and attention was applied then this could have been a modern masterpiece. But don't let that turn you away, there's still something deeply planted in this film.<br/><br/>""I think Lily's thoughts, I dream her dreams. She was always there.""<br/><br/>The Danish Girl, 7/10."
"apioneer","3","34","69","1 December 2015"," The Director did not understand a deep character
","I saw the film and thought that the director Tom Hooper(The King's Speech) did not understand the character of Lili. In the beginning we see Einar(Eddie Redmane) as a happy and successful painter living with his wife and we have no idea that he is a transgender. I found that out when his wife puts make up on him and he puts on women's clothes. Thats where the problem started for me. People who are transgender or gay/lesbian donot become transgender if someone else puts lipstick on their lips or get them to wear female clothing. They are human beings going through the identity issues since childhood. They live a very depressed life and they are little different than normal people. I wish the director had done some homework and met some of these people to know what they went through. Neither did the actor Eddie Redmane made the effort to meet some transgender people and do some research. Actors get the script and they just jump into playing a role without doing homework.<br/><br/>I was trying to like the film but when the wife gets him ready to go to the party and dresses him as a woman and then later she gets really upset and mad because another man was sitting with Lily and getting close, it totally threw her off. That does not make any sense. The wife made her husband vulnerable and now she is all upset. Lily says at one point she believes she is a woman inside and wife says that she believes it too. How can she believe that, she is not the one going through these feelings and emotions which Lily is experiencing. Then Lily was crying so hard when he was about to get the surgery but right before that scene he was all happy with the surgery. The actors did put some emotions into the film but the story was not developed and we did not have any antagonist. Eddie Redmane is a good actor as I saw him in 'The Theory of Everything'. He should be selective of roles and must do home work and research if he takes on to do these important characters.<br/><br/>I am giving it 3 stars because the cinematography was beautiful and Alicia Vikander and Amber Heard had some good talent which can be utilized in another stronger film."

Eddie Redmayne plays Einer Wegener and Alicia Vikander plays his wife Gerda . Something is not quite right with Einer and it's not just his constant infectious smile . When Henrik played by Ben Wishaw turns up the central idea of the movie is ripe for some cruel black comedy <br/><br/>Ah now I know what's wrong with TDG - it sinks under its own self importance . From the limited amount of Danish films I've seen there seems to be a competition as to make the most depressing film possible where audiences crawl lemming like to the cinema and transform in to grief whores . Tom Hooper realising the story is rather uncinematic uses some arty shots and the performances are fine and probably touches on the point that in a sexual relationship people have an irrational desire to be martyrs for one another but like Hooper's THE KINGS SPEECH the material would be perfectly suited to a television screen or even the theatre but lacks the scope to be true cinema . It also lacks the charm that THE KINGS SPEECH had and that's got to be judged a fundamental failure"

A love which means to recognize ourselves, our true I because of the other person, who love us so much that changes us in ourselves, who undress us and falls short because there is so much more behind. Alicia and Eddie are impeccable. A couple who goes beyond the boundaries of acceptance and love.

It is a dazzling looking film, it looks absolutely sensational, the visuals are beautiful, if ever an Oscar should have been won for design, costumes etc, this is it. Alicia Vikander is of course phenomenal, and worthy of her Oscar, but I have to say Eddie Redmayne is the catalyst that made the film for me, as he so often does, a truly outstanding actor, who's career rightly so is taking off.

"abouhelier-r","8","7","11","21 January 2016"," The Danish Girl
","A fictitious love story loosely inspired by the lives of Danish artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. Lili and Gerda's marriage and work evolves as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a transgender pioneer. <br/><br/>The Danish Girl is adapted from David Ebershoff's novel by Tom Hooper, retelling a true-life-story. The point about the film, of course, is that it has two Danish heroines and that one of them started life as a Danish boy. Well-meaning and polished as it is, this film is determinedly mainstream melodrama that doesn't really offer new perspectives in theme; in the year of Caitlin Jenner, it's a theme on which mainstream audiences are ready for more trenchant insight. In fact, some might have wished for a more adventurous approach to this moving story, particularly at a time when transgender representation has taken over from gay rights as the next equality frontier. If the movie remains safe, there's no questioning its integrity or the balance of porcelain vulnerability that Eddie Redmayne brings to the lead role. <br/><br/>For an actor, there can be few more challenging roles than this, in which the nature of identity, performance and transformation are all wrapped up in the very DNA of the character itself. Redmayne gives an infinitely more intimate performance and far less technical than the already stunning character he played in The Theory of Everything, that so recently won him an Oscar. He's once again certain to reap plentiful laurels in this awards season; with another role about a slow process of physical and psychological transformation. Einar's dawning discovery of his inner woman is treated somewhat like a superhero origin story. Offering more light and shade this character becomes undeniably affecting. There's an understated emotional surge in seeing Lili go to work behind a chic department store perfume counter, radiating happiness at being a woman among other women and timidly studying sensual female body language in a Paris peepshow, is one of the film's most exquisite and indelible scenes. Here, Alicia Vikander sports the same archly knowing English accent as in Testament of Youth. <br/><br/>Tom Hopper and writer Lucinda Dixon take a deeply conventional approach by framing their story as a portrait of a loving marriage with an awkward flaw. The cinematography sets up the exquisite visual tone at the start with a series of atmospheric, deeply painterly landscape shots. There are hints of a more interesting film. <br/><br/>Overall, this film is an impeccably made period piece."

","Was not sure how I was going to react to this movie as the subject matter was not something that has ever occurred in my thoughts so I went in hoping to gain some education and enjoy a movie,,and here's what happened..<br/><br/>At first I should say the cinematography and direction was flawless and made this more of a journey than a story. I was never too sure about Redmaynes acting...he was good in Theory but awful in jupiter,,,so am still on the fence with that one....saying that it was a remarkable performance but somehow left me cold and somewhat uninterested in his story...which I think may have been deliberate...as it was not so much about a sex change but more about how they at the time judged the actions of a man who dare even consider something that may have put him in a straight jacket in a padded cell for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>For me the credits all go to Alicia Vikander as his wife turned mentor ...she was absolutely exceptional and made every scene her own..she was more the lead to Redmaynes supporting role.<br/><br/>Never was going to be a classic but gives us an insight into how we thought at the time and represents true love between people who will sacrifice all to help others. May come across to some people as cold and too rigid but that was meant to take the romance out of a very serious story. I may also add that the scene where she first finds him with feminine clothing on was probably the most erotic I have ever seen an actress portray ."
"The_Film_Cricket","6","16","31","11 December 2015"," Well made, well acted. Little cold emotionally.
","The timing for a movie like The Danish Girl could not be more perfect. Here is the true story of Einar Wegener, the celebrated Danish artist who became the first recorded case of sex reassignment surgery in history coming out right as publicity about Laverne Cox and Caitlyn Jenner, and the critically acclaimed show ""Transparent"" are pushing all those worn out water cooler jokes right into the trash cans of history. The movie is a loving tribute not only to Wegener's courage in trying to find his own sexual identity during a time when such a thing could easily lead to mental institution, but also to the love and devotion of his wife Gerta who stood by him during his journey of self discovery.<br/><br/>And yet . . . the movie left me cold.<br/><br/>For all its emotional outpouring, mainly from a wonderful performance by Eddie Remayne as Wegener, The Danish Girl never quite hits the high points that I was waiting for. There's an undercurrent of expression that seems buried and never hits its emotional peak. That doesn't mean that the movie isn't engaging. It is a very involving story, and very well acted, but something feels restrained.<br/><br/>We meet Wegener at the height of his fame in the 1920s, married to the fellow painter Gerta Gottlieb (Alicia Vikander) whose work was no less brilliant but far less successful. Einar and Gerta's marriage is loving and lovingly active. Yet, for Einar, there is some piece missing, something in his soul is stirring to get out and as the movie opens those feelings emerge one day when Gerta, short for a deadline, asks him to put on a dress to pose for her painting. That's when the dam breaks and all the things that Einar has been struggling with finally bubble to the surface.<br/><br/>It becomes clear that what Einar has been feeling is not so much passionate affection for his wife (which he has) but a need to be near her, and a need to be who she is. When he touches her underwear it isn't because it's sexy, but because he longs to be qualified to be in it. When he stares at women at a party, it isn't out of lust, but out of envy. Gerta is, much to our surprise, very open to this. She's willing to embrace her man's budding orientation even if it is likely to make them social outcasts. She starts painting portraits of ""Lili"" but doesn't tell anyone that it's her husband. They even take Lili (to which he eventually changes his name) out in public where no one ever suspects that it is really Einar.<br/><br/>This, naturally, does not bode well with society at large. Early in the film a doctor gets Einar to open up about his sexuality and almost immediately prescribes shock treatment, reminding us that this was a time when doctors could essentially play God, prescribing dangerous ""corrective measures"" or simply locking a person away with no trial, examination or good reason. Clinically, this was to be his fate until, later, he met an enterprising (and far more open minded) doctor who suggested that Einar be part of his experiments in sex reassignment. That comes at the very end of the movie and is difficult to watch when you know that it eventually claimed his life.<br/><br/>What works best are the performances by Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander who lovingly recreate what must have been the most challenging relationship that any married couple might have had. She's accepting of her husband wearing lingerie under his suits and seems even a bit turned on. She sees it as kind of a kinky dress-up. The two start stepping out on the town together, not as husband and wife but as two girls on the town. For Gerta, this is a step that she finds that she must be forced to face, that Lili is becoming her husband's dominant personality. Naturally, she feels the weight of how odd this situation is.<br/><br/>The film allows us into the tight, closed-in spaces that Wegener seemed to occupy, symbolizing the confinement that he must have felt in real life. Redmayne, fresh off his Oscar win as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything gives us a performance that is achingly sad. He's a very expressive actor who always seems on the edge of bursting at the seams. And yet, like his performance as Hawking, he does wonderful work in a movie that I can't fall in love with. The film is too remote, too distance, too unwilling to engage us. The pieces are there, the story is well told but the emotional notes seem to be missing.<br/><br/>My other problem with the film is that while it celebrates Wegener's personal struggle it comes up very light on displaying his work. Wegener painted beautiful watercolors mostly of women and one suspects that they were all pried from personal expression. Yet, the work seems only fleeting in the movie, and I think that's a major misstep, if an artist's work in an expression of his soul then why don't we see him doing more of it? We see it, but we don't feel the passion that he poured into it. Gerta is actually the one who does more of the painting in the movie and it is never expressed why she wasn't more successful.<br/><br/>The Danish Girl is a movie that I struggled with. There are two beautiful performances here but I couldn't get to the emotions that I was supposed to feel. We never get to the middle of Wegener's true struggle with society at large. Yes, he's given shock treatments. Yes, he's beaten up by street thugs. But there's an element of danger missing from the film, something that I was supposed to feel but did not. This is a good and human film with greatness that is never allowed to come out."

But Hollywood is obsessed with sex and violence so while this story is not violent it is about sex, particularly Hollywood's fascination with abnormal sex. The story is about what appears to be a normal couple who are happily married but then the husband begins to fantasize about what it would be like if he was a female and the movie degrades into a fantasy about sex which appeals to voyeurs who most certainly will love this flick and praise it to high heaven. Only good thing, if it could be called a good thing, is that the actor do a good job of acting out this fantasy. So unless one is a voyeur, skip this flick."
"Prismark10","4","2","2","11 February 2016"," Against the grain
","The Danish Girl is directed by Tom Hooper who got a Best Director Oscar for The King's Speech.<br/><br/>The film is adapted from a book which itself fictionalised events relating to the real Einer Wegener and Gerda, two artists living in Copenhagen in the 1920s who were also married to each other.<br/><br/>When Gerda is let down by a female model she persuades Einer to wear female attire and pose for some paintings. This sets off a chain of events in Einer who begins to feel more feminine and creates a daring persona of Lili whose portraits sell very well.<br/><br/>Gerda seems at first to be titillated by Einer's daring in wearing women's clothing but she then also is fearful as Lili attracts male attention. Over time Einer wants to become more female and Gerda attracts the attention of other suitors, especially Hans who also knew Einer as a child.<br/><br/>The film is beautiful to look at with exquisite art direction, costumes and sets. There is a lot of location shooting as the film was shot in France, Denmark and Germany.<br/><br/>Alicia Vikander who plays Gerda is the heart of the film but her motive oscillates too much from being encouraging, to be repulsed and then standing by her man despite the attentions of Hans wonderfully played by (Matthias Schoenaerts.)<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne is young and thin enough to pass off well in those scenes where he plays Lili and I am sure he practised posing and use of his hand and body gestures a lot to appear fragile as Lili.<br/><br/>The film does feel like a mis-fire though, it feels rather starchy and well intentioned, even too conservative. Something never really hangs together in the film. I never got the feeling that Einar felt like someone who always felt he was in the wrong body which seems to be the common theme for people who take part in sex-change operations.<br/><br/>I do not think it helps that is based very loosely in true events and more inspired by the fictional novel. It wants to be a period love story of a woman stoically supportive of her husband even if he takes for the time a novel and drastic steps for transformation surgery which leads to tragedy."

So it pains me to say that watching The Danish Girl I found myself at times laughing when it was not appropriate and also just wanting to gag when it was certainly not intended by the filmmakers. This film is about a guy who, after dressing up like a woman to appease his artist wife who needed a female model, finds himself addicted to dressing up in women's clothing, then succumbs to what can only be described as a schizophrenic bout of split personality during which he thinks he is a woman, resulting in several failed attempts to lock him up in an insane asylum before he finally comes across a surgeon who offers to quite literally cut his penis off and build him a makeshift vagina.

I went to the cinema very excited like I should have been, wondering if the new Eddie Redmayne movie will be better than his previous one(The Theory of Everything), which was a great masterpiece!

Gosh, that must have been done like 40 times, and they nominated him for an academy award for that). Otherwise, the characters are shallow, and there is no attempt to get to understand his desire to become a woman other than a superficial, quickly told set of occurrences and examples.

","Going in I only new three things about the cast and crew, Les Miserables and The King's Speech Tom Hooper directed it, and that Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander starred in it. So imagine my surprise when I saw the supporting cast, Ben Whishaw that I've loved for a decade now, and crazy talented Matthias Schoenaerts.<br/><br/>The Danish Girl is in the Zeitgeist. The transgender community have been making the news these days and this film tackling this subject matter at a time - the 1930s - when it was even less accepted.<br/><br/>The film got to me, it made me incredibly uncomfortable, I shuddered and even put my sweater's hoodie on, because I couldn't imagine that a man would even consider or dare to go out dressed as woman in the late 1930s no less. It took courage, and for two hours I was scared for Lili's life. It goes to show the realism that exudes from the screen. Like I've also said in my trailer review the movie has a weight to it, it's emotionally charged, and is a great journey to embark on. Tom Hooper tackled the story brilliantly by infusing an elusive shift to the way he filmed Einar and Lili. Some of the shots and cinematography were beautiful and felt very intimate.<br/><br/>The intimacy and bubble like atmosphere of the film is accentuated by the chemistry Vikander and Redmayne have. I never had a doubt that Redmayne could do it, his performances are usually intricate and riddled with subtleties, so it was a pleasure to see in The Danish Girl. But The reel surprise for me was Alicia Vikander, who completely stole the show. She one upped Redmayne's incredible performance and made the story her own. It's Gerda's story and it's a beautiful one. The performances are completed with memorable appearances by Ben Whishaw and Matthias Schoenaerts, who are great, and also Amber Heard who I didn't recognize but liked in this role.<br/><br/>The Danish Girl is a threat, solid performances, nicely directed but it might not be for everybody.<br/><br/>By @garcwrites"

","The Danish Girl"" is yet another politically correct movie by Tom Hooper. No doubt that the topic – the story of the first transgender patient was chosen by him not by accident.<br/><br/>To criticize the film is a hard task when critics can be interpreted as intolerant and so on. However the director was not able to reflect the complexity and dramatism of the real story of Lili Elbe, born as Einar Wegener who died as a result of an unsuccessful sex reassignment operation.<br/><br/>The film is too superficial, too shallow and it seems that the director does not know what the story is about. The film Glen or Glenda by Ed Wood was more convincing. The depiction of Gerda Wegener – the wife of Lili is not believable either.<br/><br/>In the end of the film we see the text praising Lili Elbe as an inspiration to the transgenders to come. This politically correct remark leaves a sort of bewilderment. The unhealthy fixation with own sexuality is not really the most important thing in this complex world full of much more significant problems. This text is a classical example of imposing a questionable and politically motivated point of view to the audience instead of leaving space for thought. Perhaps the story of Lili can not only be an inspiration but also a warning for those people who want to solve their psychological problems with a surgeons knife.<br/><br/>The film is shot in a pleasant color scheme which makes it possible to watch the film, albeit not without severe boredom.<br/><br/>See more reviews at: http://indie-cinema.com/"

","Firstly the good points: The cinematography is quite beautiful and the Continental locations interior and exterior are so atmospheric. Costumes are good too. There is a morbid fascination that keeps one interested in watching how ""perversion"" was dealt with in the past just like another movie this year ""Carol"". Plus with the Caitlyn Jenner in the news this movie is topical.<br/><br/>The weaknesses: Casting wasn't perfect. Eddie Redmayne acts as well as can be expected, but he isn't a pretty man so how can he make a pretty woman? He looks worse than Norman Bates in drag. Amber Heard is a scene stealer as a vivacious ballet dancer. Alicia Vikander although a bit tanned for a Danish is sympathetic as the most understanding wife in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Don't understand why they made a movie about an ultimately unsuccessful operation - why not make a movie about the first successful gender reassignment instead? The message I got is some doctors will do anything even if it isn't in the best interest of the patient. Obviously the Dresden doctor shouldn't have gone ahead with the 2nd operation so soon."

The whole movie visually looked like a painting and it felt so wonderful. The Director Tom Hooper and writer David Seidler (screenplay) at the helm of the movie production what could go possible go wrong?<br/><br/>Well the trailer did what it was suppose to it-to draw you in and make you want to watch this film. It has sense of intelligence, of being a great movie based on a true story along the lines of The Kings Speech (2010). Einar Wegener / Lili Elbe played by Eddie Redmayne, was the first transgender to have a sex reassignment surgery. His story dealt with prejudice, acceptance, and biases in the 1930's. <br/><br/>What the Hell happened? The pacing made me want to fall asleep, its as simple as that. This film was put me to sleep. I could not connect with any of the actors on film. Einar Wegener / Lili Elbe came across to me like a selfish douche bag and kept on crying and crying. My God how He/She cried and I get it he/she is insensitive but for God sakes grow a backbone! My pet cat is tougher than the Einar Wegener / Lili Elbe.<br/><br/>Alicia Vikander plays Gerda Wegener, the wife and to me she was the only realistic person in the film and even then, she doesn't get enough credit. She is the most supportive film character throughout the entire movie and the wanna be transgender husband is so caught up in his own dramas that when she asked for a bit of emotional support he/she just doesn't care.<br/><br/>So, I wonder if the film would be better if they actually cast a transgender actor in the lead rather than a Caucasian male playing a transgender, much like Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club (2013)."

","With the transgender movement heavily in the media with figures like Caitlyn Jenner, and countless others heading the conversation, a film like Tom Hooper's ""The Danish Girl"" feels vibrantly relevant in today's cinematic climate. Spearheaded by two powerhouse performances from Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander, ""The Danish Girl"" is a luscious and gorgeously crafted piece, invigorating the soul with its conveying message of freedom and love.<br/><br/>As polarizing as Tom Hooper has been in his choices to shoot and frame his films like ""The King's Speech"" and ""Les Miserables,"" two films that are still delightfully poignant years after, ""The Danish Girl"" is by far his most alluring film to date. Cinematographer Danny Cohen truly hits his stride from the opening frames, as he calls back to Dick Pope's work in last year's ""Mr. Turner,"" but allows a story fragrantly moving to become his blank canvas in which to respectfully capture the film's most sentimental moments. If you're searching for the ""Hooper-isms"" like people shoved into the corner of a scene or extreme close-ups, you'll find them, but there's a resourceful way in which he's utilizing his tactics that feel genuine and necessary.<br/><br/>Last year Eddie Redmayne won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in James Marsh's ""The Theory of Everything,"" beating out some big names. A performance I quite liked but didn't fully understand the gravitation over other names throughout the year. As Lili Elbe, Redmayne ignites his most daring and captivating turn of his career. Visually married to the woman in dedication to the role, he allows 'Lili' to wash over him both with aggression and delicacy. It's a near masterpiece performance that I'll remember for years to come.<br/><br/>Equally compelling, and even more magnificent in her turn is Alicia Vikander, who in just under two hours, solidifies herself as one of the most breathtaking and exciting actresses working today. Vikander's subtlety and interpretation of 'Gerda', is a sensational vessel of complexity and honesty, as she runs the gauntlet of a woman desperate to understand and struggling to hold it together. As the tears well up in her eyes, and she desperately asks Lili to have 'Einar' hold her, it's the single most heart wrenching scene this year. It's the strongest and most compulsory turn by an actress this year, and one that will have the Academy Awards running to check off for a nomination.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, in particular Amber Heard and Ben Whishaw is staggeringly good. Matthias Schoenaerts' massive and stoic persona adds to the mystery and complicated nature of Lili's existence.<br/><br/>Where ""The Danish Girl"" faults itself is with the script by Lucinda Coxen. While she successfully captures the spirit and tone of Lili's struggle through her life, her inserted beats of on-the-nose dialogue can be trying at times. Having Gerda say things like ""I felt like I was kissing myself"" when recalling her and her husband's first kiss, was a little over-the-top in an attempt at foreshadowing. However, she delightfully captures the humble beginnings of their marriage, with the secret that plagues their union with accuracy.<br/><br/>Just one year after winning his long overdue Oscar for scoring ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" composer Alexandre Desplat synchronizes fervor and empathy with his brilliant orchestra. I believe its one of his most profound works to date. Same can be said for Production Designer Eve Stewart and Costume Designer Paco Delgado, who both capture the essence of European history with accuracy and vitality.<br/><br/>""The Danish Girl"" is a seducing feature with fortitude and grace, all of which measures up to heroic story of being yourself, no matter what the circumstances. Tom Hooper's direction, along with Redmayne and Vikander's work will likely be at the top of Oscar's to-do list for the awards season."

With movies like Room, The Hateful Eight, The Revenant or Ex Machina, The Danish Girl is just the least competitive one. Not that Alicia Vikander didn't deserve her Oscar as she's a good actress but the story just didn't do it for me. Even if it's based on real events, Lili Elbe as a transgender pioneer, it's just a story that made me yawn a couple of times during the movie. Eddie Redmayne has the perfect physique to play the role of Lili as he easily could pass for a woman with a bit of make-up on, but his constant girly shy smiling and eye blinking is just annoying after awhile. The cinematography and the acting are good, nothing bad to say about that, but the subject of transgenders is just something completely boring to me. They can do whatever they want with their lives, it's their choices, but in my eyes if you're born as a man you're a man, and that even if you feel like a woman. Nothing wrong feeling like a woman but you're born a man so just deal with it. So yes I might be opiniated about it, like everyone is entitled to his opinions, but that's how I see it and so watching a movie like this one is at one point just waiting for the end to come so that I can watch another and more interesting movie.

","The Danish Girl, the weakest movie from the 2016 Oscars and a movie I'm going to remember for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>The Danish Girl isn't a particularly bad film nor is it a good one by contrast. This movie tries too hard to make you feel emotionally attached to the main character. Unfortunately, it doesn't do it correctly. The main character, Einar, is too one dimensional. The only things he loves is his wife and his paintings. He has little to lose since his wife loves him unconditionally. Through events in the movie, Einar discovers that he is a woman at heart and wants to expand on his feelings. It's sloppy, questionable, and never addresses how he has never felt this way before.<br/><br/>Like a binary switch, Einar now has two personalities completely different from one another. It feels contrived and forced. The movie could have used this opportunity to expand on Einar as a character, adding more depth and complexity to his persona. However, they rely on his femininity as a crutch, expecting you to feel emotionally bound based on empathy. The movie forcefully has an unnecessary fist fight just to make the audience feel more pity, more empathetic, and more attached to this character. It rubs off as contrived and concocted, the audience is bound to this character via their natural reaction to feel empathy to someone weak, but in reality this just masks the odor beneath. the character is unrelatable, has little to lose, has little depth or complexity, and little to nothing interesting. <br/><br/>The visually pleasing camera work hides its very simplistic story. The movie makes its final attempt to pull on your heartstrings by having Einar die after his operation is completed. The ending doesn't sit right with me as an audience member and made me feel questioned on what exactly I should be sad with. From a cinematic standpoint, Einar didn't have an outstanding relationship with his wife who only truly accepted him at the very end of the film; unfortunately the little sorrow I felt didn't last very long since I never grasped the characters on an emotional level. Emotion bound on purely empathy can be dismissed with nothing more than an acknowledgment. <br/><br/>This movie relies too much on how you feel. The ugly duckling story executed in this movie was bland and overdone. The pleasing and relaxed visuals only hide its very simplistic story. The emotional binding to the characters were cheap and left an artificial taste in my mouth. This movie felt like it was trying to fill in every cliché from using art to bash you over the head with symbolism that has already been established, to cheap fights to make you feel bad.<br/><br/>The Danish Girl, though it made an admirable attempt to imitate a better movie, just doesn't hold up too well on its own merits.<br/><br/>4/10"

","After ""The King's Speech"" and the perfect musical adaptation of ""Les Miserables"", this is a tremendous step down for Tom Hooper. A disappointment from almost every point of view and worst of all, a definition of Oscar Bait film, which hurts even more coming from a director whose movies in the past strayed away from that stereotype.<br/><br/>What the film can count on is of course Desplat's music which rarely ever fails to elevate a film, no matter the quality, Alicia Vikander's charisma and splendid screen presence and an unbelievable production design, that is often what repeatedly saves scenes from being cringe-worthy. It is often what is telling the story the most and without such an excellence in this department I am sure I would have got bored fifteen minutes into the film. But, also thanks to Tom Hooper's distinctive and beautiful visual style, I hardly ever got even annoyed by the film because of such a beautiful scenery.<br/><br/>For the rest the film fails to explore or be insightful on even the most basic of its themes, it doesn't raise any thoughts or ideas, it stays on a superficial note for the whole duration and hardly managed to make me feel emotion. That is due both to the fact that the filmmakers probably forgot the meaning of understated or subtle and through at you an overwhelming quantity of acting and melodrama of which I had had enough by the first act. This screenplay does not set up its characters or story coherently, it is all over the place and doesn't give any type of depth to motivations or back story. Almost everything, right from the very beginning, is thrown at your face, spoon fed to you repeatedly and it makes for a dull experience, were the audience member is never given the chance to be engaged.<br/><br/>Look, I loved Eddie Redmayne before it was cool to love him. His work in Les Miserables is indicative of his talent, but it's the second year in a row in which he turns out a performance that has nothing to do with what I consider to be true acting. He is acting so much it is unwatchable at times, he does not even come close to disappearing from screen and I don't care whatever he went through, that's none of my business and nor should be anyone's. DiCaprio, Redmayne, Day-Lewis, I don't fuc**ing care what the fu*k you went through to give your performance when the result on screen is so unauthentic. Yes I went there, even with Day-Lewis. It's just not the type of acting that I enjoy and it's actually the kind that I deeply hate. I want to see a character on screen, as Ian McKellen says: both the acting and the actor have to disappear from screen and this is the total opposite. All I see is an actor acting and it takes away every possible, genuine emotion the film could raise.<br/><br/>I would not suggest to check this one out, I certainly won't go near it anytime soon. It was a dull and disappointing experience and even more so because of all the talent involved."

He acts on screen the way a 14 year old bust-ass virgin around a high school cheerleader would act; all quite and timid and self-conscious. His role in The Danish Girl was no different. The entire film was one big awkward moment. I felt like Redmayne didn't know what to do with his hands the whole time. And they spent more time on imagery then actual screen-play dialogue.

At that point, a person is not a man, regardless of gender.<br/><br/>However, she (the wife) displayed a remarkable amount of love, patience and devotion to her husband. She bent over backwards for him, and did everything he asked.

To me, there is no story behind people dying from archaic medical procedures ... ESPECIALLY if they were advised against it by doctors. If Doc says no, and you do it anyway, it is not considered a ""tragic"" death, by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it seems that this movie was just trying to cash in on the Bruce Jenner situation. It didn't tell me a story that I felt needed telling, for any reason. It was not an entertaining movie, and it didn't educate me to anything I found relevant.

And by itself, as a story telling about one of the first known cases of a man becoming a woman in the 20th century, it sucks. <br/><br/>I don't mean this as any affront to anyone who wants to look for the messages of acceptance of others and considering the politics of the moment it's a touchy subject. But a movie can not be good despite being about something important, and actually that importance can sink a movie even further. In the case of The Danish Girl, it's art-house, Oscar-bait trash, and it's borderline (or simply just) dangerous as far as showing images of what it's like to go through what Elinar/Lili does in this story.<br/><br/>Where to begin? I think this is a story that, if the filmmakers (namely the director and screenwriter, I'm looking at you Hooper), had gone to the actual true life material it could have made for some strong stuff, or at least some interesting contrasts. Take Gerda (who by the way with Vikander in a very good performance for what she's given has more screen time it seems than Redmayne, why she has Best supporting actress who knows whatever); she is shown as a talented, capable artist and she gets more offers and perhaps, arguably, gets better and deeper as an artist once she draws Lili - in his/her ambiguous form in art - and that's fine. But the real life Gerda, if one reads about it, was lesbian or at least bi-sexual. <br/><br/>Imagine how this would've deepened the material, how there would be some tougher question to ask: a woman married to a man, which is not her exact sexual preference, then married to a woman and... what if she found *Lili attractive*? Forget the book for a moment and look at that original story and what potential is there for exploring sexual ambiguity and doubt on multiple fronts, maybe even being a little more daring with how sex and bodies are depicted (there is nudity here but it's mostly chaste)? Nope, can't go there, we've already got the Hot-Button-Topic of trans so can't let in the bi or lesb part of it, right? <br/><br/>Vikander does what she can with the role, but so much of the dialog is trite, ridiculous, and flowery when it really should not be at all. And perhaps real transgender people can correct me, but it seems stupid the way the story takes certain turns. The first time that Lili meets in private with another man (Ben Wishaw's character, who is mentioned to be homosexual so there's, uh, no problem I guess as far as fidelity goes) her nose bleeds. Then when Elinar goes to the doctor and talks about his problems he describes (the doctor reads this) as bleeding out the nose, stomach cramps, and it happening once a month. Really? If psychosomatic things happen as far as men getting the same ""time of the month"" bodily functions in the scope of becoming a woman, then fine, but in the scope of how it's presented in the film it's meant to be taken seriously and it feels laughable. So much of this film can be described as laughable, insipid, and frankly insulting to people who go sometimes their whole life feeling this way. From the way the film, not talking about real life or the book I mean the film here, presents it a man suddenly feels womanly as soon as he puts on stockings and a dress and some make-up and a wig.<br/><br/>If the script had given just some minor indication about how Elinar felt beforehand then it might be more believable in the dramatic context of what comes after. But it never does that. In fact it goes further - Lili doesn't paint anymore once she is fully herself, and I didn't buy this either; does one really change all that much that artistic talent goes away too? But on top of all of the bad decisions and poor dialog from the script is Redmayne's performance, among the worst I can think of that's has the AMPAS seal of approval in nomination form. He is both so mannered and yet so affected, so over the top and obvious with every move that he/she makes, and it's to the point where his 'immersion' into the role seems more like a stunt. I can't decide if he may just be an actor who isn't particularly believable in general or if it's just here (in Hawking at least his immersion was more physical as far as a full-bodied thing). Here it's... lots of tics and stares and hand motions and a lot of nonsense that is sickening in its excessive nature.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is a poor attempt at making something grandiose, and Hooper's direction, which in his past work was sometimes distracting, is more noticeably bad here (we get it, you like wonky frames) I'm sure there are other films that depict transgender themes and characters better - I haven't seen it but have heard wonderful things about Tangerine from 2015 - but this is both watered down and preposterous, and it leaves its characters stripped down to where Lili is an unlikeable B-word and Gerda is the mostly accepting, all-too-loving wife."

","You know whats better than this whole film? The 20-second skit Chris Rock and Tracy Morgan put on at the Oscars today. ""I'M THE DANISH GIRL. THESE DANISHES IS GOOD GIRL!"" (chomps Danish messily)<br/><br/>But unfortunately, this is the film we have to watch. Its worth saying that Vikander absolutely deserved her Oscar for this film. She's the best thing about the movie by far, and I fell even further in love with her (if possible) in the first frame of the film. She can convey more in a look than Redmayne ever could - disappointment, frustration, fervor, passion, sensuality, horror, shock and revulsion. She's so good at establishing chemistry with anyone she wants to, she has a Mark Ruffalo level of talent at scaling that chemistry back. We can see clearly as her chemistry with Redmayne crumbles and when she tearfully pleads for her husband to come back, you just want to reach in and console her.<br/><br/>Redmayne, on the other hand, portrays Lilli/Einar as an absolute jerk. Sure, Einar is gone but Lilli doesn't have to be a bitch about it. Redmayne spends most of the film reacting as he runs his fingers over women's clothing or his own body - the least subtle foreshadowing ever. Becoming transgender isn't a brainwashing process, Eddie, you're better than this! Redmayne's best work comes as he portrays Einar's trembling emotions. When he plays Lilli, he is just Eddie Redmayne in a wig with no effort to change his voice. Vikander carries 90% of their chemistry, with Redmayne not doing nearly enough to pull his weight. During one sex scene he just whimpers and simpers like a virgin about to be molested and it is completely disturbing.<br/><br/>The dialogue is a complete turd, full of awful lines like: - ""It was like kissing myself."" 0/10 for plagiarism from Back to the Future and terrible foreshadowing. - ""Am I pretty enough?"". Not Eddie, you're heart is too broken. - ""You hurt Lilli!"" Lilli isn't your imaginary friend you idiot. - ""You're enabling him by not keeping a lock on your wardrobe. You know your husband is insane right?"" Well that escalated quickly.<br/><br/>And the worst line of all - ""I want to be a woman not a painter!"" I almost think that Vikander's incredulous ""can't you be both"" was unscripted reaction to that dreadful line.<br/><br/>The film is dreadfully paced, with the final act in particular being a pain to live through. One should not look forward to the main character's death. Not even Vikander could salvage the final act, which was far too long and boring. Amber Heard has a wonderful cameo as Ulla, but here character is never explored enough to understand. The work behind the scenes is fine, especially nice costumes, but it can't salvage a sappy and disgusting film that I wish I'd never had to see."

","In the current crop of films, this stands both head and shoulders above the rest. The subject matter in my opinion was handled with a depth that is rearly seen in modern films, cinematography and expression of the whole environment, characters, subject and plot is second to none. The story flows and feels neither fast or slow but in time, bearing the soul of all it touches. My first thoughts on seeing the trailer was that a film like this could only touch at most skim the surface of this subject matter, but don't be fooled like me, be prepared as you will soon find yourself skill fully placed in this world seeing and feeling, maybe even understanding the whole point of it all. It both answers and asks questions of the viewer but not in intrusive or forceful way which is a brilliant stroke of genius.

"MOscarbradley","5","4","7","7 January 2016"," Business as usual from the predictable Hooper
","You know what to expect from a Tom Hooper film or rather you know what not to expect and that is something edgy. Hooper is the man who gave us ""The King's Speech"" and then ""Les Miserables"". ""The King's Speech"" won the Oscar as the year's Best Picture and Hooper himself, somewhat surprisingly, picked up the Oscar for Best Director. It was a perfectly fine example of what in America might have been called 'Masterpiece Theatre' and ""The Danish Girl"" is no different, apart from being duller and even more conventional when the material positively cries out for 'edgy'.<br/><br/>It's the story of Einer Wegener, a painter in the Copenhagen of 1926, who was also Lili Elbe. Lili was one of the first recorded examples of transgender, or for the uninitiated, a man 'trapped' in a woman's body but this ham-fistedly well-intentioned film approaches the subject with such an initial tentativeness that it's hard to quite know who Einer/Lili actually is. At first he seems simply to be just another man who likes to dress up in his wife's clothes and who gets a sexual kick out of it. Then he comes across as just another gay man in a frock and the movie is at least half way through before we realize Lili is actually transgender.<br/><br/>It's all done in the best possible taste though God knows who Hooper imagined his audience might be. It's hardly a tribute to either Lili or to the transgender community today, while gay men could just find it a tad offensive. Hooper's usual target audience of Aunt Ednas might gasp and sigh but are otherwise unlikely to embrace the picture. On the plus side, Eddie Redmayne does get under both Einer and Lili's skin and inside their heads with a real technical flourish that's certainly impressive. It's an Oscar bait performance, showy and ostentatious, but at least it's well-crafted while Alicia Vikander is excellent as the poor, put-upon wife, despite the part being shamefully underwritten. Midway through I started to notice the costumes, not just the eye-catching frocks but the suits as well. When that happens you know the film is in trouble."

At the time of writing this review its average rating is 5.8. I think that is a bit tight or a bit low. I would give it a 6.5. What I liked about the movie was the interesting story. I often complain about pace in a movie being too slow, but I think this was relatively well paced for a the telling of this couple's story. I find Eddie Redmayne to be overrated as an actor. This is consistent with his performance in this movie. He certainly looks great in the part, but I found his gasps and sighs in the early scenes to be rather unbelievable, as the character awkward and scared and learning to come to grips with the truth that his identity is not what it seems. I found him rather more believable as the newly blossoming trans-gendered girl, enjoying his femininity. Alicia Vikander as the wife of ""Lilly/Einar"" was outstanding. All of her emotions appear deep and authentic. Her pain at adjusting to all of the changes. Her struggle to let go of her husband because as she comes to realizes he is seeking out his essence. All in all, a reasonable portrayal of a couple's struggle.people might argue that the story lacks some of the important problems that face trans-gendered people, most notably, being repressed and rejected by society. But all politics aside, this is one person's story."
"jadepietro","6","7","16","26 December 2015"," A Natural Woman
","(Rating: ☆☆½ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is mildly recommended. <br/><br/>In brief: Two fine performances are lost in a wearisome biopic.<br/><br/>GRADE: B-<br/><br/>Back in the 1920's, Gerda Wegener created erotic female portraits. Asking her artist husband, Einar to don women's clothes and pose for these paintings paved the way for his sexual liberation and freed his inner identity as Lili Erbe in Tom Hooper's uneven biopic, The Danish Girl. The film tells the story of the makings of one of the first transgenders, even though some of the actual facts are glossed over and never accurately presented. <br/><br/>￼The film depicts the balancing act that this married couple faced with the proper degree of poignancy as they both come to terms with Einar's vibrant counterpart. Lili's persona starts to overshadow him. Naturally these changes affect their relationship as the gender issue becomes irreversible. While Einar opts for sex reassignment surgery, Gerda must deal with her own emotions through this turmoil and decide her rightful place in Einar's / Lili's life. That the roles are played by Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander only enhances the film's impact.<br/><br/>Hopper does craft his film well and give his talented leads enough leeway to create indelible characters, due more to the credit of the actors' prowess than the actual writing. In fact, the dull screenplay by Lucinda Coxon never allows them to act realistically to their life-changing situation. Yes, they are both free spirits and eccentric artist types but these major events would certainly test any Bohemian lifestyle to the max. (This is especially true in the pivotal first scene when Greta under-reacts when discovering her husband's secret penchant for wearing women's clothing. Her response rings false.)<br/><br/>￼One can readily admire the filmmakers' sincerity and earnestness with this project. But this important subject deserves a more realistic spin than the lyrical approach that Hooper decides to take as the director. He downplays the serious nature of the film with too many lingering travelogue shots of Copenhagen and other period details. The pacing of the film becomes tedious and slower than Einar's own physical change. Beside the script by being problematic, so is the actual physical transformation by Redmayne from Einer to Lili. One never quite believes that he is a she. (It is most jarring in a scene where he dons the female garb to be ""my fair lady"" at the ball when everyone is all eyes at this ravishing ""non-beauty"". Yet another flawed moment.) The actor, while displaying enough feminine mannerisms, cannot convincingly transcend the transgender role due to the hair and make-up design of his character. <br/><br/>￼Still, Eddie Redmayne makes some bold choices in the title role and lets his character underplay the uncertainty in the outset and become more selfish and determined toward the end. (In fact, there is one nicely structured scene when the actor starts to mimic the sexual movements of a prostitute that shows the inner struggle that tore at Einar. This inspired moment tells more beyond mere words.) Even making the situation more effecting is Alicia Vikander as his loving spouse. Her character is torn between the man she married and the woman she admires. Ms. Vikander is a revelation, giving a nicely modulated performance by showing her subtle range in her emotional highs and lows. Amber Head as their friend, Ulla, brings some sparks to her lifeless role. Other supporting turns by Matthias Schoenaerts and Ben Whishaw never rise to that level of excellence due to the sketchy nature of the characters they play.<br/><br/>Alas, despite the superior acting by the two leads, The Danish Girl is in need of some personal realignment as well."

Instead, I got a movie where Lili is never allowed to really live her life. I got a movie with two ham-fisted heterosexual romance plots. I got a movie that, in the end, seems to punish it's transgender lead for the crime of being herself. <br/><br/>This movie shows Gerda as being anywhere from skeptical to downright negative towards Lili's transition, when accounts say that Gerda was very supportive of Lili, and remained attracted to her after she began living as a woman. Lili was even portrayed as ""being Lili"" whenever she showed attraction to a man, but ""being Einar"" when attracted to Gerda. What?? Presenting as a woman does not suddenly mean Lili has to be straight. <br/><br/>I could rant about this movie for pages. In the end, I was greatly disappointed.

","With all factors of the film considered The Danish Girl should be a sheer delight. On paper it's a perfect film; Tom Hooper as Director, Eddie Redmayne at the forefront of the picture and Alicia Vikander in a splendid supporting role. But in reality The Danish Girl is formulaic, unfulfilling and forgettable.<br/><br/>Einar Wegener played with delicacy by Eddie Redmayne is a confused individual. Unable to come to terms with his sexuality, he craves to wear women's clothes. He's not even comfortable in his own skin and is about to proceed with an operation that will change his life.<br/><br/>There are so many biopics nowadays that one has to discard the filth and meander some. The Danish Girl has both of these tragic qualities. Yet, if it had a solid script it would be a great film. There are far too many familiar lines that destroy any hope of sympathy for the flawed characters. Lines like; ""We were playing a game"" ""Let's give them something special"" and ""I finally feel like my true self"". Okay, I made the last one up, but you get the point.<br/><br/>From solely a production standpoint The Danish Girl is flawless. Beautiful shots of the surrounding landscape of Denmark, sell the time period and setting of the story. The music is suitably emotional and the performances are of the highest order. But that script, the way it kills any momentum and renders all drama meaningless and uneventful. The writing remains the most important part of a biopic. I need to believe that these events really did happen. But when the script feels this contrived and fails to generate the required emotion that the writer wants me to feel, then I'm afraid I can't believe in it at all.<br/><br/>The Danish Girl literally screams Oscar bait and melodramatic drivel. If you liked the film, then I'm happy for you. By all rights I should have fell in love with it. The film deals with a man who struggled to come to terms with his sexuality. I myself can relate to the character, having spent many years identifying myself. But in this day and age films that are merely passable and relatively harmless do not cut it anymore and The Danish Girl remains as conflicted as its central character.<br/><br/>C"
"MattBrady099","5","6","14","26 December 2015"," The Danish Girl - Movie Review
","Nice try Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hooper. I know for a fact that the two of you wanted a second Oscar so badly, so you made this movie, but this isn't fooling anyone.<br/><br/>The Danish Girl is about a Danish artist, depicted her husband, Einer, as a female in one of her paintings. As the painting gains attention, Einer begins to transform as well - becoming more and more feminine until Einer becomes Lili Elbe - and becomes the first person to receive a male-to-female sex reassignment surgery. While Gerda is supportive, she comes to realize this change will prove a challenging ordeal to their relationship - even more so when Hans Axgil, an art dealer and old friend of Einer, comes into her life.<br/><br/>Oscar bait movies like this really makes my skin crawl, because this movie literally ticks off ways of getting that Oscar and it's quite shocking how noticeable it is here. I really liked The King's Speech, I mean it's not for everyone but I thought it was a great movie and I couldn't wait to watch Tom Hooper's next film. Oh Hooper, what happened? I didn't care for Les Misérables and I sure didn't care for this movie. The Danish Girl sadly fails to deliver and everything feels so force. The emotions, the art and the story itself falls completely flat.<br/><br/>What the hell happened to Tom Hooper? after he won that Oscar he really lost his touch. There's hidden greatness in this movie and Hooper could have easily taken a different path to make this movie great, but he doesn't do that here, but he intend plays it safe and makes everything feel so force with emotions that there's no emotional attachment. There were some well directed scenes in the movie and it is well shot, but I felt like the movie was missing something and that's me actually caring about whats going on. The movie itself wants me to care about whats going on with the characters, but the only one I really cared about or felt bad about is Alicia Vikander character. I miss the old Tom Hooper.<br/><br/>Now I've got nothing against Eddie Redmayne as I think he's a talented guy, but he seriously needs to pick better roles in the future. He was absolutely awful in Jupiter Ascending and he sure wasn't good here. He's performance in this movie is what I call ""pretentious"" and ""by the books Oscar bait"". The emotions were there but I just didn't feel it and how the execution could have been better. A role like this is not a easy challenge and this must have been tough for Eddie, I mean in recent interviews, he has said that the role has personally changed his way of seeing things with genders and trans gender people. He took a risk but it sadly didn't come together as promised. I swear, if Eddie Redmayne gets a second Oscar for this movie, I will be mad.<br/><br/>Alicia Vikander was hands down the stand out of this movie. As I said before, I cared for her more than Redmayne character and that's saying a lot. Shes been not-stop impressing me this year and I can't wait to see more of her in future movies. She was brilliant in this movie as I really felt her struggle and her dealing to whats going on in her life is truly heartbreaking. She was without a doubt the best part of this movie and she did an magnificent performance.<br/><br/>The cinematography was good, the style of the movie was neat, the score was pretty solid and that's really it.<br/><br/>Overall The Danish Girl isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. This movies purpose of existing is just to win awards and nothing else."
"ccrownlaurel","5","2","3","28 December 2019"," Beautiful, but disappointing.
","I was really looking forward to this film--and in the end, I can say that I'm glad I saw it. The music and cinematography are beautiful, truly artful. The actors of Lili and Gerda really drew me in. The whole film packs an emotional punch.<br/><br/>But after the credits rolled, my lingering feeling was a sense of how tragically misguided Lili's character is, and how Gerda suffers for it. I'm not sure how closely the events mirror history, and I'll touch on spoilers here, so you're aware.<br/><br/>As soon as Einar embraces Lili, Einar becomes ""dead"" to her. She can't even speak from her prior (male) perspective, because she has fully constructed (realized?) an alternate self with completely new wants, needs, goals, thoughts, habits, etc., leaving her previous self behind. There's a point at which a doctor diagnoses Lili with schizophrenia, and honestly, her transformation feels a lot like that sometimes.<br/><br/>Reality check: There is no ""Einar"" and ""Lili."" There is one person, with one soul, and one mind, one set of behaviors and feelings, that is always evolving, but IS and ALWAYS HAS BEEN an uncomplicated state of ""self."" Whether your body matches. If you consider your soul to be feminine or masculine, it simply IS. You don't need to reject your partner of 10 years, and forget how and why you ever could have loved them, just because it doesn't ""fit your image"" anymore. You don't need to forget why you ever loved your lifelong passion, and only become interested in getting married to a man and bearing a child, in order to be a woman.<br/><br/>And I looked it up: Gerda, in real life, adjusted her thoughts and feelings, to the point where she was painting lesbian erotica and portraits of Lili for the rest of her days. Probably because she had fallen in love with the spirit of a person. Whereas Lili seems to have become obsessed with having the appearance of something.<br/><br/>And it's totally fine for your sexuality or gender identity to change later in life, but to say that you ""don't have feelings for your wife anymore simply because you've become a woman, and you're not a homosexual woman."" Well--Reality check again--You said it yourself, Lili, you were always a woman, so you must have had some bisexual feelings once upon a time, when you happily got married, and had regular sex with this person, for 10 years. It would have been way more honest for Lili to say, ""I've done some soul searching, and I'm realizing that I'm not attracted to you anymore, as a matter of fact I'd like to pursue a relationship with a man."" But instead she kept Gerda around for years and years, refusing to communicate with her, on account of ""not being able to tap into Einar's voice anymore,"" allowing Gerda to struggle and make blind decisions and try her damndest to support this ultimately selfish person.<br/><br/>I was left with these maddening, saddened feelings after the film.

"CinemaClown","Null","2","3","1 February 2016"," Another Oscar Bait From The Director Of The King's Speech & Les Misérables
","Advertised as a ""true story"" in spite of being adapted from the fiction novel of the same name, The Danish Girl is an awfully constructed, historically inaccurate & thoroughly lifeless feature film from the director of The King's Speech & Les Misérables and, just like those two period pieces, qualifies as yet another Oscar bait from Tom Hooper.<br/><br/>Loosely inspired by the lives of Danish painters Lili Elbe & Gerda Wegener, The Danish Girl narrates a fictionalised account of the two and focuses on their relationship as their marriage & professional lives undergo a complete transformation when Lili accepts herself for who she is and opts for a sex reassignment surgery, thus becoming one of the first recipients of the procedure.<br/><br/>Directed by Tom Hooper, The Danish Girl masks itself as a biopic of Lili Elbe yet is more concerned with Gerda's difficulty in coming to terms with her partner's identity. The novel itself discards many known facts about its real-life figures thus rendering them purely fictional characters and yet, the filmmakers choose to not correct the mistakes and still have the audacity to sell it as a true story.<br/><br/>The set pieces & costumes are in sync with its timeline, the camera hovers through some beautiful landscapes yet fails to penetrate the hollow people inhabiting this picture, the plot is unnecessarily stretched and while Alexandre Desplat's score is mesmerising, it is more focused on Gerda instead of Lili. Eddie Redmayne does well with what he's asked to play but the finest performance belongs to Alicia Vikander.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Danish Girl is so full of Oscar bait characteristics that it doesn't even care about getting its facts right and leaves out the elements that may have hurt its chances of winning a few awards. Being advertised as a bold journey of a transgender pioneer, it's a film about straight people despite what it claims to be. A dull, overlong & horribly misguided cinema that's as insulting to the transgender community as it is to the legacy of Lili Elbe, The Danish Girl is worth skipping."

","This film and it's actors just did not capture this real story to the best of their ability. Don't get me wrong as they are both talented A stars but this character Lily was portrayed to be so overly feminine and superficial in her hyper focus on dressing in female clothing. Lily's relationship encounters with men were equally lacking in authenticity. Yes she was a woman trapped inside a man's body but are we still simplify the trans gender or those who identify as such to be only in it for the lipstick and the clothes? Lots of flaws on the approach to this true story moving at a turtle pace when within all that mundane waste of the viewer's time could have been filled with so much more about Lily we'll never know about. Implicitly though I must say that the relationship with her soulmate Gerta shows a perspective of true love and the crosses one bears for those we love with a very unique lense that is remarkably enlightening, inspiring and crucial for all to witness."
"Landofree","Null","1","1","30 July 2016"," Overwrought, overdone, overly dramatic performances...
","This was basically a PBS/BBC/Lifetime Network TV movie, but due to it's content and budget it became an independent feature film. <br/><br/>The cinematography was not good, out of touch with the story and moments, and basically seemed a little self-indulgent. Many of the shots seemed like they were chosen because of how cool they looked, and not because it was a reflection of the moment, nor furthered the story. The wide angle lens was the worst choice out of all the lenses...were they saying it was warped? <br/><br/>This movie would have made a better stage play, in story, but mainly due to the over-dramatic nature of the performances that suits the theater and not the cinema. <br/><br/>There was no real sense of drama, and the stakes were very low. Society doesn't accept you...we get it. Most doctors think you're nuts...we get it. You aren't happy with yourself...we get it. Any conflict that was in this story was easily stepped over, and we never, not for one second, thought this guy wasn't going to go through with it. By the way, Eddie Redmayne played this character as more of an effeminate homosexual, than a trapped woman. Alicia VIkander had more balls, sexuality and femininity than Redmayne. There were a lot of woman in this movie, and Redmayne wasn't like any of them. <br/><br/>The more I think about this movie, the worse it seems to get. Too on the nose with every moment, too much Lifetime Network styling, too much theater sensibility. And too much piano. The Kings Speech was better, but still like a stage play. <br/><br/>It's no coincidence that Tom Hopper has a background in both Theater and Television...that's were he should stay. These films aren't cinema, they are filmed TV Plays, and they are better suited for those mediums. <br/><br/>Come to think of it, this movie seems like a parody.

","Very few films would I say are pretty much perfect. But this one is. I don't want to belabor all of the extraordinary aspects of the film, so I'll mention what I think are the salient ones.<br/><br/>For anyone interested in understanding viscerally what it means emotionally to be transgender, this film provides an extraordinary pathway. The process of Lili's awakening realization that she is transgender is, simply, how it happens. From a touch, to an interest, to an attraction, to a gravitational pull and then compulsion borne from the powerful force of Lili's authentic self exploding from her unconscious to the surface.<br/><br/>The tidal waves that this unleashes are extraordinarily accurately portrayed. From the creative block this causes in Lili's painting, to the tension and near-destruction of her marriage, to destructive social forces: thug violence, the law that would incarcerate her, medicine that pathologizes her, all of these are frighteningly accurate and are still ever-present today.<br/><br/>Probably the most profound aspect of the film is the love that evolves and deepens between Lili and Lili's wife, Gerda, not just in spite of, but because of her recognition of Lili's need to transition. Most spouses abandon their transgender loved ones when they come-out or transition. Gerda doesn't and this enables them both to discover and create a love that is beyond what most of us will ever experience.<br/><br/>I could go on about the virtually perfect performances, story structure, character development, cinematography and direction, but you just have to see the film because no words do it justice. I don't think I've ever been brought to tears during most of a film. But this one did. If you see it, you'll never be the same."

","I have no reservations about Redmayne and Vikander's performances, as the Academy obviously agrees with nominating both in the acting category --- Redmayne for Best Actor (following his win last year for the portrayal of Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything"") and Vikander for Best Supporting Actress.<br/><br/>The root of the film's disappointment is its screenplay and execution by the director. Hooper's project never reaches a profound level as he intends it to be. Every chance we are given to dig deeper into the titular characters' inner struggle, Hooper distracts us with the flourish appearances of - women's fashion, the sceneries, the bohemian lifestyle, and social challenges.<br/><br/>As Einar, Redmayne's every tremble, every touch is heartbreaking. Early in the film, we catch a glimpse of him caressing Gerda's silk undergarment --- his yearning to be a woman so strong that it both frightens and excites him. In his desperation to escape a facade that the world seemingly accepts, Einar strips himself bare, almost too forcefully, and pulls on women's costumes. Such intimate moments become increasingly rare on Einar's path to become Lili. Instead, Hooper wastes so much screen time on a bunch of doctors and their inability to comprehend Einar's condition and the subsequent treatment of him as an insane person.<br/><br/>At some point, Hooper shifts his focus to Gerda. She is the steadfast presence and constant support for Einar and Lili. Gerda may be the only one who truly understands Lili, which Lili vocalizes in her final moments, and the world acknowledges (albeit indirectly) in its appreciation of Gerda's famous portrait paintings of Lili. <br/><br/>But Gerda is a lonely soul too, and Vikander's depiction of her inner turmoil gets it right. One particular scene brings to mind --- walking out of her own gallery, Gerda refuses an umbrella and cries alone on a street bench, drenched in the rain. The Einar she knows is never coming back, but she never strays from her responsibility, as she insists that ""Einar is still my husband."" I wish I could have seen more of Gerda's actions and reactions when Einar is completely replaced by Lili. I loved Gerda and Einar's affectionate moments early in their marriage, but the intimacy is never realized in latter part of the film.<br/><br/>Referring to both Lili and Gerda as the Danish girl, Hooper may have tried to explore both characters equally, but what we saw was a half-hearted attempt at each. As a spectator, it was easy to get immersed in the story early on. Had the film been fleshed out more, I have no doubt that Redmayne and Vikander could have carried the characters to a satisfying end. Whatever the ineptitude was, the film could not sustain a depth that it falsely led us to believe."

"bkrauser-81-311064","7","3","6","4 January 2016"," Two Talents converge for a Mediocre Movie
","Thus far Eddie Redmayne has made quite a niche for himself as the go-to actor for physically challenging roles. Not only has he made the on screen transition from a shy, bright and love struck student to brilliant wheelchair-bound ALS sufferer in The Theory of Everything (2014), he's also had to hold down constant convulsions of laughter while playing a space Dracula with spasmodic dysphonia in Jupiter Ascending (2014). Now he plays Lili Elbe, the first woman to ever experience gender re-assignment surgery.<br/><br/>Einar Wegener (also Redmayne) is a fairly renowned artist living in Copenhagen with his wife Gerda (Vikander). Always more at home in more feminine accouterments, Einar slowly becomes more open with his wife about modeling for her and her paintings as a woman. Gerda becomes convinced that he can indeed pass as a woman so as a ruse they arrive at a party with Einar as Lili. Beyond that point the two slowly realize that there's more to Lili than just an occasional model for Gerda's inspiration. Thus the two enter an odyssey for self-actualization and enduring love.<br/><br/>The true story is not quite as romantic as the movie would suggest though it's hardly proper to fault a movie for making fiction out of truth. The relationship between Gerda and Einar/Lili serves as the rock-steady center of the film and it's easy to see why. Everything they say and do is believable and organic to the characters they have created and Vikander deserves special mention and praise for every tiny authenticity. Is it any wonder that both are nominated for Golden Globes and are poised to receive Oscar nods?<br/><br/>Though if there is an undisputed star of the picture it is production designer Eve Stewart. The woman has been working with director Tom Hooper since The Damned United (2009) and it's easy to see why. Her beautiful, painstakingly researched period detail and impassioned decor gives the movie the believably and artistry it needs to pull off such a unique story. With three Oscar nominations under her belt, I dare say this is her year to finally take away the golden statuette.<br/><br/>There is however one very large problem that relegates The Danish Girl firmly in the Rent-It category and that is the editing. Much like Tom Hooper's last Oscar season gambit Les Miserables (2012), the film feels long; far too long. Hooper seems to want to take you to a moment in time and won't move the story along until you're sobbing with the characters. The camera lingers as everyone's dirty laundry tumbles out and everyone on-screen blubbers in a ""Dreamed a Dream,"" booger-sliding-out-the nostril, overwrought-to-the-point-of- hilarity-type way. This happens far too many times leaving susceptible audience members overwhelmed and cynical viewers checking their watches.<br/><br/>Despite two stellar performances, awe-inspiring set design and a harrowing true story rich with possibility, The Danish Girl succumbs to the same problems that plague similar biographical period pieces. It's overwrought and occasionally boring while pandering to an audience that will surely overvalue it's cultural cache in years to come. That said, the performances really are that good. They should be considered as a high point in both Redmayne and Vikander's careers due to their sensitivity and realism. The chemistry between the two can make even the most pessimistic person believe in true love."

","When a transgender woman is played by a cisgender man, it sends the message that the two can be seen as the same thing, which is untrue. It's also very disrespectful, at best, to the woman whom this movie is all about, Lili Elbe. As previously stated, by having a cisgender man play her, they send the message that she herself was nothing more than a man pretending to be a woman, which essentially is taking her identity and stomping on it. I could've given the movie a chance if Lili had only been played by a trans-woman, but since she was not, I find myself unable to enjoy a moment of it. Great job, guys. You took a story that could've been the greatest movie of the year and you blew it before you even began shooting."

","Greetings again from the darkness. There was a time when movies were cultural trendsetters in such areas as speech, style and behavior. Somewhere along the way, a transition occurred, and these days movies are more a reflection of the times – showing us who we are and focusing mostly on what society focuses on. Oscar winning director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech) capitalizes on the current movement to mainstream the LGBT community by telling the story of Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe, a transgender from more than 40 years before Dr. Renee Richards, and 75 years before Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner.<br/><br/>Lucida Coxon has adapted the 2000 novel from David Ebershoff, which is a fictionalized version of the 1933 ""Man Into Woman""  the personal letters and diaries of Einar/Lili (edited by Niels Hoyer). The film opens in 1926 Copenhagen as successful landscape artist Einar Wegener and his struggling-to-gain-respect portrait artist wife Gerda appear to be happily married and quite attracted to each other. During this segment, Hooper and cinematographer Danny Cohen utilize a somewhat distracting quasi-fisheye lens that distorts most every shot  presumably making the point that this couple's life is itself distorted. There is no shortage of foreshadowing despite the bohemian artist lifestyle. Einar doesn't miss a chance to caress the silks and frills as he visits his ballet dancing friend Ulla (Amber Heard), and things escalate quickly once he poses in stockings for one of Gerda's portraits.<br/><br/>The best and most interesting segment of the film is the middle as Einar begins to explore his Lili persona, and Gerda is diligent in her support  going as far as to encourage her husband to attend a party as Lili (introduced as Einar's visiting cousin). The public interactions with their friends and acquaintances are a little difficult to accept, though the scenes with her initial male suitor Henrik (Ben Whishaw) make it clear this is a point of no return. Despite this, the times are such that Einar willingly attempts to repress the Lili side, and even visits multiple medical and psychological specialists. It's this segment that reminds us how quickly the medical profession of the era overreacted by prescribing radiation, electrotherapy, and even by institutionalizing those who were so inclined.<br/><br/>Gerda and Einar/Lili ""escape"" to Paris, where it becomes obvious that it's Lily who has been masquerading as Einar, rather than the other way. The duality of Einar/Lily soon dissolves and daily life is filled with lessons  such as a Paris peep show where hand and body movements become part of the transition. Eddie Redmayne (last year's Oscar winner for The Theory of Everything) gives an extraordinary performance, and is at his best when exploring the subtle nuances of Lili. It's crucial to note that while Redmayne's performance is a physical marvel, it's Alicia Vikander (A Royal Affair, Ex Machina) as Gerda who provides the real heart and soul of the story. Though the film glosses over some traits of the real life Gerda, Ms. Vikander is stunning in more than a few scenes, which in the hands of a lesser actress, could have proved cringe-inducing.<br/><br/>Adding some depth in limited roles are Matthias Schoenaerts (Rust and Bone) as Hans, Einar's childhood friend all grown up, and Sebastian Koch (The Lives of Others) as the pioneering doctor who performs the sex reassignment surgeries that physically transition Einar into Lili. Even with the strong supporting cast, there is no mistaking this as anything other than a film that belongs to Mr. Redmayne and Ms. Vikander.<br/><br/>Director Hooper takes a very conventional approach to an unconventional story, and this ""safe"" direction seems designed to make the uncomfortable story more palatable for mainstream audiences (similar to how Brokeback Mountain handled homosexuality). However, don't mistake this for Tootsie or Mrs. Doubtfire. There are two serious stories here: the struggles of one person's identity, and the corresponding challenges of a married couple. Hooper's style is by no means cutting edge, but does feature one of the best lines of the year  ""I've only liked a handful of people in my life, and you've been two of them."" This story has bounced around the movie world for awhile, and for many years was rumored to have Nicole Kidman in the Einar/Lili role. Your imagination can determine if that would have made for a better fit."

","I don't think this film was great.

I think some of the proceedings and dilemmas are a bit problematic in how they are presented, but overall it was a story I bought. I thought Redmayne was pretty good in the role, he did all it required him to do. The problem is that I don't think the screenplay really went any deeper into a psychologically complex character. I know it's easy to hate him, but he's a very good actor and while I don't think he deserved an Oscar, he still is rather underrated around here. Alicia Vikander also gives so much to her role. In many ways she's the true heart of the film. The fact that she was campaigned as supporting is ridiculous (although not nearly as ridiculous as Jacob Tremblay and Rooney Mara's frauds).

","Tom Hooper did an excellent job bringing this story to life. The first 10 minutes for me was a little tough to warm up to the characters but what kept me interested until the first real clue as to what the main character was feeling was the subtle hints of Feminism. An extra lingering moment and this gaze that Eddie Redmayne would give as he watched his wife put on make up or his friend practice ballet made for an interesting introduction. The timing of those cuts were perfect thanks to the editor. The production design and set locations were aesthetically pleasing to the film. I loved the B-roll of the country side just as much as the suburbs of Danmark and streets of Paris. Wardrobe in this time period for both men and women were also tasteful. Even if you agree with sex change or not, you will become emotionally invested in the film due to the great writing, and performance from the actors. Nothing less than a phenomenal job by Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne as he never seemed to miss a beat. You could see perfectly the confusion and hardship this character goes through every single minute of the film. Supporting actress Alicia Vikander also had an impeccable performance showing how difficult it is for a women needing her husband in such a controversial and intense situation. Nothing short of excellent acting from these two. Just to touch on sound. I felt a scene deserved special mention. Dark and low notes with a romantic song was perfect for the scene that was unraveling for both the audience and the characters in the film. Lastly, the cinematography was good, but there were some things that bothered me. There were shots that shot up the nose at a character. Shallow depth of field at times was used to much to where there was almost no focus and a couple of wide shots that had to much distortion on the ends. Other then those small things. I liked the use of negative space. The use of shallow depth of field so that you had to focus only on the actors expression and 1 dark scene that used more shadows then light. (Which could have been used a couple more times in my opinion) Overall, this movie was phenomenal. You become emotionally invested through great screen writing, amazing performances and good directing from Tom Hooper. This film has very Graphic nudity so I strongly forewarn you to keep that in mind when deciding to watch this film. Hoping that it does well as it comes out on one of the busiest days of the year, Christmas!"

"murphytempleton","4","2","4","5 January 2020"," Wasted potential
","Overall, I thought this movie was pretty well acted. The dialog felt natural, the characters consistent to how they were written, and the cinematography was beautiful and interesting.<br/><br/>I'm also going to ignore for a moment that my research into the movie found it to be completely inaccurate to the actual story, because that's something I've come to expect. Instead I'd like to focus on the main point: the transgender portrayal.<br/><br/>It is an incredibly common trope that being trans is like having a completely different person inside of you, with different thoughts and ideas and desires. And it is true that some transgender people portray it this way, because it can be easier to express yourself and remove yourself from a stressful situation. The problem is that you are NOT a different person from one moment to the next... if it were that easy, it would not be as painful when you try to come out.<br/><br/>Einar is shown to be madly in love with the wife at the beginning of the movie and just... doesn't love her after beginning transition? It's more common that after the transition, the spouse pulls back because of the perception of sexuality (for instance, a straight woman may have trouble being with a transwoman post transition simply due to the strain on sexual attraction), but I've actually seen more couples try (and succeed) to make it work or come to amicable parting. But that's a tangent.<br/><br/>Much of the plot relies on the fact that she was turning into someone else. So much could have been done without that. Even if they wanted relationship issues, barring the fact that transitioning in itself can be a painful and fascinating process without that, you could have just as easily gotten this with sexuality confusion or gender representation or societal pressure or a million other accurate issues that weren't ""oh no, she's a new person now"".<br/><br/>I could rant about this all day, but the my biggest contention is that by making her an entirely different person, she ends up villainized... People don't want to love the cheater, the liar, the abandoner. So in the end, all of our sympathy is urged toward Greda, and understandably so by the positioning of the issues. So this movies is not so much about their ""unconditional love"" as it becomes more about a ""trans woman"" who constantly hurts her spouse, who refuses to leave. Any time they might have talked it out or had an actual discussion, something would happen to cut it down and then everything was fine again??<br/><br/>No. No. This does nothing to benefit the narrative for women, or the struggle for transwomen specifically. Movies like this only further the idea that transitioning means LOSING the person you love instead of accepting and embracing them.<br/><br/>This is getting very long, but I just- if you're looking for an accurate portrayal of what it's like to be transgender, this is not it... This movie, while interesting and well made, will not help you understand. I wish I had a better recommendation for you."

","2015 has been a relatively letdown of a year for film. Sure, you have the obvious masterpieces and returns to form for several huge franchises, but I feel like most of the films we expected to be Oscar contenders fell short of where our expectations hoped they would reach. That is yet again the case with The Danish Girl. Coming from the director of Les Miserables a few years back, The Danish Girl is loosely based on the life of one of the first people to have a sex transformation in early 20th century Denmark.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne plays Einar/Lili, who begins to feel comfortable in woman's clothing after his wife, Gerda, played by Alicia Vikander, asked him to pose for one of her paintings. Both Redmayne and Vikander give great performances, with the latter probably outshining the raining Oscar winner himself, but the film around them is just okay. With those great performances, you would think you feel very connected to their characters, but I never did. Their chemistry feels real and the conflicts that arise are most definitely real, but the solutions that the script calls for all feel unimaginative and uninspired.<br/><br/>Sometimes you can feel Tom Hooper's direction and Lucinda Coxon's script attempt to outshine the performances too much. By that I mean, the dialogue and structure ends up feeling too cute or too clever for a subject matter that could and should be tackled in a far more meaningful manner. If anything, I'm sure this film will do good for the movement and awareness of trans-gender in general. One of the most jarring things that's only touched upon in The Danish Girl is the lack of understanding at all for trans-genders, who were outed as insane during this time, and that was under 100 years ago.<br/><br/>The Danish Girl had promise but it only delivered on a few fronts, that being the extraordinary performance from Vikander and also Redmayne, while also creating a beautifully shot landscape of 20th century Europe. But the film itself had no regard for subtly in the big moments and profoundness in its quiet moments.<br/><br/>+Vikander is Oscar worthy<br/><br/>+Redmayne once again proves he deserves the hype<br/><br/>+Looks gorgeous<br/><br/>-Unimaginative writing<br/><br/>-Style over substance<br/><br/>5.7/10"

"Turfseer","6","5","16","5 December 2015"," Story of transgender pioneer will grab you but still needs more character development
","Director Tim Hooper, responsible for the excellent Oscar winner ""The King's Speech,"" is now back with a much more obscure but fascinating historical tale, ""The Danish Girl."" I was completely unaware of the story of Lili Elbe, the first man to undergo gender reassignment surgery, who lived her last tragic years as a woman.<br/><br/>The film begins slowly as we meet newlyweds Einar (Eddie Redmayne) and Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander) in Copenhagen during the 1920s. Einar is a mediocre landscape painter but Gerda is a much more talented portrait artist. We finally break into Act 2 when Einar puts on a pair of stockings to take the place of a female model who fails to show up for one of Gerda's sessions. The stockings trigger the gushing out of Einar's repressed feelings that deep inside he's really a woman. <br/><br/>Soon Einar's alter ego emerges as Lili, and Gerda brings him to a party, passing him off as Einar's cousin. The game is short-lived when Gerda catches a possible gay suitor kissing Lili and she expresses her fears that she might be losing a husband. Einar can no longer accept leading a double life and decides he's much more comfortable as Lili than Einar.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most dramatic scenes in the film involve Lili attempting to get help for all the anxiety she's experiencing in her transition to life as a woman. The reactionary character of the medical establishment appears in high relief when one professional after another labels her as a deviant. Lili must flee these phony ""helpers"" with the threat she may be institutionalized and possibly lobotomized. The average man on the street also shows their brutal intolerance when Lili is beaten up by a couple of thugs who are offended by her effeminate mannerisms.<br/><br/>The Danish Girl is based on a novel and one gets the feeling that the true life Lili Elbe was a bit more interesting and complicated than the way she is depicted here. Redmayne does well in conveying Lili's angst in transitioning to the opposite gender but appears also to fall in love with the character's affectations as opposed to conveying different aspects of her personality. When Lili takes a job as a salesgirl, all she aspires to is enjoying gossipy conversations with her co-workers. In contrast, Gerda is a woman feminists can be proud of—her career takes off when she sells portraits of Lili that rival any of the well-known artists of the day.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Lili was a pioneer and very brave in attempting gender reassignment at a time when the odds of such a procedure being successful were extremely low. But I would argue that this seemingly virtuous act is not enough to classify the Lili depicted here as a compelling character. Hooper does indeed attempt to flesh Lili out a bit by suggesting that her neediness bordered on narcissism. This is reflected particularly on how we're supposed to feel about Gerda's reaction to the loss of Einar—in the film she's conflicted when Einar's childhood friend, Hans Axgil, wants to become involved with her. Hans is actually a fictional character and in real life, Gerda was bisexual and lived for quite a while with Lili. It appears Gerda's despair over the loss of her ""husband"" was invented, in order to create some additional drama, to move the story along.<br/><br/>The Danish Girl ends on a wistful note. It's implied that because Lili did not wait to heal after her first operation, this led to her death. According to history, she had a series of operations and the last one, which involved in the implantation of a womb, led to her early demise. Whatever the case, Lili's desire to live as a woman was so strong that she was willing to take the risk of surgery, despite the obvious odds of failure. The Danish Girl is worth seeing as a fascinating history lesson but keep in mind some of it is probably more fiction than fact."
"Irishchatter","8","4","12","23 December 2015"," Captivating and sad....
","Eddie Redmayne was absolutely the best for playing drag as a male to female transgender. He didn't have to keep his voice too high or too low, he did it in the right way - his own voice. Lemme tell ya, he was so handsome regardless if he wore women's clothes or not. I bet all the women actresses wanna get at him lol.<br/><br/>I actually thought that this movie in the beginning was boring because Eddies character kinda looked sad and dull. However in the midway, it was beginning to look interesting when we see him putting on the women's clothes! Also the storyline draws you in, I say the reason is that Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener were real people. It was sad that they both didn't be all lovey dovey after Lili's transition but instead the marriage was annulled and Lili unfortunately died leaving Gerda penniless! That's quite shocking to hear, especially Gerda made such great money for selling her portraits of her husband when he wasn't Lili. It's also a shame that her husband and herself never had children after 6 years together. It makes me wonder, was that why Lili transitioned? I guess we'll never find that out!<br/><br/>It's a good movie, it is really sad though! Get a box of tissues too if you decide to watch this!"

","I recently watched the Danish girl and was very unimpressed. This is obviously a man's interpretation of a man's transition to womanhood..and that is that women are eye candy... and entertainment for men.<br/><br/>Einar is a biological male and his transformation to Lili is a biological male's perception or idealized version of what a man would expect a female to be.<br/><br/>Gerda is supposed to unselfishly give up her identity and her life to support Lili's metamorphosis. Lili is completely narcissistic in her unrelenting pursuit of her transition ...and devoid of any compassion for his wife, Gerda.<br/><br/>Lili is like a caricature of all the stereotypes or male fantasies about what womanhood is or should be...batting her eyelids, making a pretense of shyness or modesty that is intended to be alluring.<br/><br/>Lili is an inauthentic woman who apparently finds being sexually objectified meaningful ...with fantasies of giving up her career as an artist to being a domestic servant.<br/><br/>Frankly, Lili seemed to mock womanhood altogether. Lili is a male-identified woman...totally circumscribed by ""masculine"" standards ...everything a male would imagine...and ridiculous.<br/><br/>Lili seems more auto-aroused by her own reflection then having any alliance with authentic females. Authentic women don't waste there time auto-eroticizing themselves in front of mirrors and practicing pouty lip and tongue movements, hand gesturing seductive self caresses... unless, of course, they are auditioning for a film made by men.<br/><br/>As a woman I am offended by Lili's attempts to mimic a peep show stripper who makes a profit by stripping and doing what men want. Obviously strippers are not paid to be their authentic female selves...duh!<br/><br/>Male-to-female transgenderism seems to present more as a sexual fetish than any attempt to align with the inequities of the sisterhood.<br/><br/>I myself am trying to disengage from the servitude and entertainment value of being a woman and establishing myself as an authentic person.<br/><br/>Men presume to be the ultimate judge and authority on femaleness. I choose not to allow men to define me.<br/><br/>This movie was just another example of men promoting their stupid concepts of femaleness...just more propaganda from the gender reinforcement police.<br/><br/>Of course... men are superior in every way to women. And so it would seem to follow that biological men can transition to make superior women.<br/><br/>If we are ever to achieve any sense of authenticity, credibility, and even the right to have a personality of one's own, we women need to wake up, have some self- awareness and quit caving to men's ludicrous expectations.<br/><br/>And now we are allowing male-to-female transgenders to be our experts ...defining womanhood. Our future is in male - defined AI (Artificial Intelligence). They have begun the process by artificially altering our appearance on camera...the next step is artificially perfect females created by men. Yuck!"

"Lalpera","10","2","5","1 March 2016"," A movie worth gold every minute it runs
","The Danish Girl is one of the greatest cinematic epics I am ever privileged to watch. I must say it is nearly faultless with an unorthodox story to make, yet bursting with great acting in the 2015 silver screen. Tom Hooper's marvelous directing spreads all over the movie cleverly binding the immensity of all talented actors â€“ Alicia, Eddie & Mathias. And it nicely pairs with Lucinda's crafty screenplay as the story smoothly entwines from the start around the main two characters Gerda and Lili. They bond with each other in a very romantic, artistic manner. <br/><br/>It is quite impressive to note that despite the intensity of sexual nature of the main theme, director does not show deliberate scenes of love making although he could have easily done so. Nudity too, is shown in its true artistic way, not the cheap phonographic way. And there is not a single swearing word that you hear in most Hollywood movies these days just when there is the slightest relationship dispute. Even with a shattering, marriage breaking situation Gerda and Lili do not swear at each other despite the anger and frustration within themselves but show the care and love to each other and act quite civil. <br/><br/>Another striking feature of this movie is the clever editing of each scene before it gets in to drag or boredom. Scenes build up to a climax and get cut quickly yet cleverly connects to the next scene without disturbing the flow. Best editing seen for a while! Needless to mention that Desplat's beautiful soothing music and the splendor of Cohen's cinematography further makes it a truly unforgettable melancholic cinematic poem. Don't miss it! It is a movie worth gold every minute it runs."

"estebangonzalez10","6","2","5","30 January 2016"," Forgettable period piece, but strong lead performances
","""I love you, because you are the only person who made sense of me. And made me, possible.""<br/><br/>Tom Hooper's latest film is a fictionalized portrayal of real life Danish artists Einar and Gerda Wegener. It is a period piece that re-imagines the love story between these two artists. Einar who later becomes Lili is recognized as one of the pioneers in trans-gender, but the film takes many liberties and is far from representing the true relationship between the artists. Alicia Vikander plays Gerda, the artist who painted her husband as a lady. Eddie Redmayne is Einar Wegener, who after enjoying the transformation in his wife's painting discovers himself as Lili. The film focuses on the couple's struggle to accept these changes, although history proves that this depicted love story is far from true. David Ebershoff's novel takes several liberties, ignoring the fact that Gerda herself was a lesbian. <br/><br/>Now that I got that settled and out of the way, I can focus on the film itself. It is a formulaic biopic that does little to stand out from other period pieces. This is my fourth Tom Hooper film and despite being gorgeously filmed, I found it to be one of his weakest efforts. My favorite from him continues to be The Damned Untied, which ironically was the first film from him I've seen. The King's Speech and Les Miserables were also movies I enjoyed, but to a lesser degree. The Danish Girl has a fantastic production design, but it stands out exclusively for its two lead performances. Both Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander are superb and worthy of their Oscar nominations. Redmayne comes fresh out of his Oscar win for portraying Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, but I think his performance here is even better and just as physically demanding as his previous one. He probably won't win, but I think this performance is stronger. Vikander has had a wonderful year after her stunning performance in Ex Machina. Here she gets to shine along Redmayne and even steals several scenes from him. Ever since I first saw her in the Danish film, A Royal Affair, I've always been a fan of Vikander's work. This might be her best performance to date, but competing against Kate Winslet in the supporting category for this year's Oscar will make it hard for her to stand a chance. The Danish Girl is worth the watch for the strong performances alone, but there isn't much more to the story. I found the pacing a bit dull and lost interest in the story halfway through. The Danish Girl is a forgettable formulaic biopic, but it's worth the watch for the fantastic performances."

","After finding her utterly mesmerising in Ex_Machina,I was thrilled to hear that Alicia Vikander was finishing 2015 by doing a costume Drama with Tom Hooper,which led to me getting ready to meet The Danish Girls.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Getting set for her work to be shown in a gallery,artist Gerda Wegener gets her husband Einar Wegener to wear a dress due to a model not turning up.After they get a positive response to the painting,Einar continues to pose in women's clothes for Gerda.Starting to feel confident in being able to express all of his secrets,Einar reveals to Wegener that he has had a lifelong identification of himself as a women called Lili Elbe.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Spending most of the film together, Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander both bravely show their vulnerabilities in the elegant naked scenes,which focus on the emotional struggle that they are both facing.Standing by Lili Elbe at every stage of the operation,Alicia Vikander gives a superb performance as Gerda Wegener, (who in real life was a lesbian and had an open relationship with Elbe-something which the film sadly omits)as Vikander shows Wegener trying to keep a film grip on her emotions whilst supporting Elbe during her operations,but struggling to come to terms with the end of their marriage.<br/><br/>Treating Elbe with the utmost sensitivity, Eddie Redmayne gives an excellent performance as Lili Elbe,thanks to Redmayne revealing Elbe's desire with a splendid delicacy,whilst displaying the overflowing anguish that Elbe gets from the reactions of those nearest to her.Adapting David Ebershoff's ""loose"" biographer of Wegener & Elbe,the screenplay by Lucinda Coxon rushes by the origins of Elbe & Wegener's relationship and goes straight to Einar Wegener revealing Lili Elbe.Whilst this approach does allow the title to focus on the challenges that Elbe faces,it sadly stops a foundation being built for the love and compassion that Elbe and Wegener have for each other,with Elbe showing little interest in Wegener's (her long-term partner) feelings on the matter,which leads to this film being a very elegant, but far from sweet Danish."
"stephendaxter","8","3","10","4 January 2016"," Incredibly well acted and highlights a very emotional transformation
","'The Danish Girl' is a Romance/Drama Biopic that highlights the story of Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener and how their relationship evolves during Lili's transgender transformation. This movie was very emotional, incredibly well acted, fantastically shot and told a very interesting and dramatic story that had me fully engaged pretty much the whole way through. The biggest draw to this film was the inclusion of two of my favourite actors right now, Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander. Put one of them in a film and i am most likely going to see it, put both of them in a film and there is no way i'm gonna miss it. Their performances are the real highlights of the film, i feel that Alicia's performance isn't going to be as recognised as Eddie's because he did have a much more complex role and did it amazingly. Redmayne managed to transform into this person to the point where you only saw Lili, it was fantastic to see not only Eddie transform into the character but to also watch Lili's transformation from Einar into her true self. Will Eddie follow up his Oscar win last year with another one? Probably not. But i do see a nomination on the horizon. <br/><br/>The big focus of the film was Lili's emotional journey, and her transformation from a Danish painter to the Danish girl. The topics and themes surrounding transgender people are not so widely talked about or represented today, so it was incredibly interesting to see this film represent those themes and how the idea of being transgender differed in the 1930's from the way it is today. I would have liked the film to go a little more into those complications than it did, but seeing some of it play out was somewhat eye-opening and does raise many questions that are still fairly relevant today. I found this journey very engaging and knowing nothing about the story it is based on made for a very unpredictable plot that surprised me on more than one occasion. Where i would say the film was a bit of a let down was where there were times where i felt like i had already seen similar emotional scenes a few times throughout the film. There were a few moments where it didn't feel like the film was going anywhere, and i think all of that was due to the second act being so long. The first act ends rather early and the third act begins fairly late and the second act was pretty long and did have a few repetitive moments. But when you are very invested in the journey of Lili's character, it didn't matter so much in the film overall. <br/><br/>So in the end this is a very engaging film with a lot of emotion, great performances, is very well shot, and covers many themes related to being transgender that raises a lot of questions for the viewer. This is a vey 'Oscar Bait' film, it is clearly made to hopefully be a contender at the Oscars, and i feel like it may have tried a little too hard to appeal to that audience and it may have suffered in some other areas. But it is still a film i would recommend if romantic dramas are your thing. - 7.9/10"

","As with all true stories, this film is fictionalized but it is based on real events of a century ago. The story of one of the first people to ever attempt to change genders, it is a reminder of how far we have come in understanding those who feel they were born the wrong gender.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander both deserve Oscars for the heart-rending, real performances they give here. I felt like I was in their real home with them, coming to grips with situations with them. I already knew Redmayne was an extraordinary actor, but I did not know Vikander. She has a quality much like Jennifer Lawrence which makes you just fall in love with her as she lovingly grapples with her husband's dilemma, realizing that she must support him.<br/><br/>The story is presented in such a beautiful manner, it is a joy to watch. That was surprising. Perhaps it is the sign of a superbly-made movie. Everything about this movie is top-notch, and the entire supporting cast is remarkable. I had no idea I would love this movie as much as I do."
"lor_","Null","3","11","14 December 2015"," Good acting, but script mish-mashed too many themes
","Tom Hooper, a specialist in period/costume pieces who has no particular theme or identity running through his work, bit off more than he could chew with this adaptation of ""The Danish Girl"". Perhaps working from a true story was his undoing, as the script was all over the place when it should have been laser-like in focusing on a topical and personal subject.<br/><br/>This is an interesting case of a movie that does not live up to its potential, in that the audience is primed to like it, identify with the characters and rooting all the way. Unless there is someone who meticulously goes to movies randomly (I used to be that guy decades ago when I was a fanatic who went to virtually EVERY new release), the ticket buyer is primed for a trans-gender storyline. No ""The Crying Game"" surprise/gimmick reveal here.<br/><br/>The first few reels confused me as to the filmmakers' stance, in that our protagonist's tactile attraction to fabrics and specifically women's clothing, encouraged by his playful wife, was textbook fetishism, and implied the subject was going to be transvestism, not transsexualism, two distinctly different lifestyles and genres. Even more unsettling was the seemingly unintentional, almost random, shifting of points of view between the two characters - by the end of the film I was personally rooting for and identifying not with Redmayne and his issues, but rather with his wife so skilfully played (and unlike typical Redmayne bravura, underplayed) by Vikander.<br/><br/>My favorite film on the subject of artists competing and one overshadowing the other is not ""Amadeus"" but rather Ken Russell's usually (and unfairly) maligned ""Mahler"". In that film there is a classic fantasy-like (as is nearly all of that film and most of Ken's work) scene of Alma Mahler burying her own sheet music in a small pen-case, the little funeral resembling that of kids' burying pet birds in a children's film. In ""Danish Girl"" of course it is the wife who becomes the celebrated artist, portrayed at the expense of exploiting her husband in his alter ego aspect modeling for her as Lily, his female self trapped in the same body. This inversion where the wife is the bad hat rather than the usual overbearing husband in a pair of artists-relationship (see ""Frida Kahlo"") was fascinating, but overpowered the Redmayne story for me.<br/><br/>Thls nostalgia (or ""Nostalghia"") aspect of the movie with its lovely settings, made the climactic shot of Vikander discovering the childhood line of trees that obsessed her painter husband his whole life was quite moving, but again a tangent that overwhelmed other themes. I didn't buy into the main premise of the script at all, namely that it is better (my interpretation inferred from the movie's structure) to live one day self-realized as what you would like to be than to achieve longevity in a rut, a square peg stuck in a round hole (forgive my metaphor). I live in a rut and perhaps masochistically enjoy it - my life has covered several ruts, as I changed careers, goals and focus, but I comfortably settled into my new rut each time. Had the true-life story had Redmayne live happily ever after as a woman, perhaps remarrying with a new true love (sounds like Stephen Hawking again?), that I could buy, but it didn't happen that way in real life. That is why I prefer straight fiction, in which nitpicking over ""not true to the story"" becomes irrelevant since there is no true story.<br/><br/>Lastly, I have been watching quite a bit of XXX trans-gender videos lately, ranging from the intelligent (Nica Noelle's highly sympathetic features) to other less advanced more exploitation-minded directors such as Dana Vespoli and Joey Silvera. They all deal, aimed at a niche porn market, with trans-gender females' love affairs with males, or cis women or even other trans-gender females. In this currently popular Adult genre, the protagonists are living as women and unlike Redmayne's styling in ""Danish Girl"" often look clothed exactly like women and more beautiful than their cis peers. But they all retain male genitalia, not having had the operations mentioned in the Hooper film. <br/><br/>A mainstream film dealing with trans-gender people who choose that route, rather than the fatalistic approach of Redmayne's character (who clearly came to abhor his ""male parts"" to the extent I was fearful of a Vincent Van Gogh-styled knife cutoff self- mutilation scene) is something I look forward to. Hollywood pap ranging from ""The Christene Jorgensen Story"" to Barry Mahon's ""I Was a Man"" better traversed the full real-life sex-change genre than Hooper's misguided ""Danish Girl""."

","Based on a true story: In 1920s Copenhagen, Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) is a landscape artist and his wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander) is a portrait artist. When a female model is late to pose for Gerda, she asks Einar to temporarily replace her, partly dressed in women's clothes. This incident re-stimulates Einar's early desires to live as a female.<br/><br/>It is also notable that Einar's transition to Lili Elbe is one of the first known transgender incidents in history.<br/><br/>I'm sure my fellow movie buffs can recall times when a film was universally acclaimed and we just didn't see what any of the fuss is about. Sometimes, we even disliked the film. For me, the most glaring cases were probably ""Lost in Translation"" back in 2003 and ""Life is Beautiful"" in 1997.<br/><br/>""The Danish Girl"" creates that rare situation in the opposite direction: a film that is universally rated as mediocre or disappointing; but one which I found superb. The naysayers at least agree that Redmayne and Vikander are great in their roles. More on that later.<br/><br/>I believe that director Tom Hooper (who helped raise ""The King's Speech"" to such a high level) deserves great credit for elevating the mood in this film to one of intensity mixed with beauty. There is much risk in expressing true identity at a time when the term ""transgender"" did not even exist. The deeper understanding of artists, among others, is on display with kindness and compassion. The beauty of cities like Copenhagen, Paris, and Dresden (with exquisite set designs, cinematography, and music) all contribute to keep the aesthetics of this film at the highest level.<br/><br/>But it truly is the acting that makes this film as great as it is. Redmayne's performance alone would have been adequate but Vikander's contribution is more than that of a supporting role. As an emerging artist and as a woman whose marriage is changing in ways that could never have been equaled at that time, Vikander brings great depth to Gerda as her love and support are unyielding during a very difficult and unusual time.<br/><br/>Redmayne is truly sensational in this film. This is not a surprise considering his turn in last year's ""The Theory of Everything"" for which he was rightly praised with multiple awards. In ""Danish Girl"", his depth goes even further as he boldly and courageously exposes the sensitivity of a unique and misunderstood soul. From the time he first reacts to wearing women's clothes, the movie is riveting as he easily conveys nuance in his facial expressions and takes great risks to be truthful and authentic.<br/><br/>As Charlize Theron did with ""Monster"", Redmanyne's sublime performance raises a fine film to an even greater level.<br/><br/>OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Lead Performance by Eddie Redmayne"
"becki_rainbow","5","1","2","26 January 2018"," Interesting watch
","I enjoyed the film, it was interesting, but I did find Eddie Redmayne really annoying, kept doing this wide eyed look anout, or wide eyes look away that just made him look a bit crazy eyed! The female lead was awesome. Well worth a watch."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","1","2","24 January 2018"," Brave beauty
","Finally got round to seeing 'The Danish Girl' last night, having been intrigued by it (thanks to its subject, the way it was advertised and the talent involved) for a long time but not having the time due to heavy music and music college work commitments and being behind with my ""must-see"" list. <br/><br/>My thoughts were that it is a beautiful and courageous film that won't be, and clearly isn't judging from the polarising user review opinions here, everybody's cup of tea, but is a sensitive and emotionally powerful portrayal of a subject matter that's important, very much relevant (even more so now) and controversial. It takes a lot of guts to portray this subject in any form and 'The Danish Girl' acquits itself beautifully if not perfectly. <br/><br/>'The Danish Girl' to me is not without its imperfections. It does drag a little at times and trimming 10-15 minutes off the running time would have helped it perhaps. The script, while mostly thought-provoking and sensitive, has instances where it's too lightweight and needed a tightening up and could have been bolder and take more risks. <br/><br/>So much works though. 'The Danish Girl' looks gorgeous, like an art painting come to life, especially the landscapes and sumptuous period detail. The costumes are evocative and pleasing on the eyes and the whole film is beautifully photographed. Alexandre Desplat's score is one of his most hypnotic and enchanting and Tom Hooper's direction is perhaps him at his most subtle and understated. <br/><br/>It, in terms of writing and story, is mostly thought-provoking and treats the subject matter with an honesty, sensitivity and a big emotional wallop. There are instances such as the ending where the film did bring tears to my eyes. <br/><br/>Can't say anything bad about the performances. Eddie Redmayne is the top-billed star and he does give a very deeply felt and courageous turn. Oddly enough though Gerda is actually the focus, where her complex feelings are ones that anybody in her position would relate to. Alicia Vikander's performance is truly sensational and her chemistry with Redmayne is also one where it is clear they're in love with each other. All the supporting cast are strong, my favourite being the sympathetic one of Matthias Schoenaerts.<br/><br/>All in all, beautiful and brave film but not for all. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"lesleyharris30","5","1","2","29 January 2017"," Suffers from an Unengaging Plot and Characters,
","The Danish Girl is a very mediocre movie with an overall poorly developed plot and an excellent cast that do their best to try and save it. There is no questioning the beauty of the scenery itself, the cinematography is outstanding. Tom Hooper clearly put a lot of work in to establishing the world these characters are living in. Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne also shine in their roles, beautifully portraying the emotions these characters are experiencing in these rough times. <br/><br/>While the performances are stellar, the characters themselves are unlikeable. I had no sympathy for Einar, a man who completely disregarded his wife's feelings because he wanted to become a woman. He comes across as arrogant and selfish from the beginning, which makes it hard for us to support him in his journey. <br/><br/>It is also tries far too hard to be heartwarming. The objective of almost every scene is to make the audience cry, delivering a wide range of emotions that is in no way subtle and leaves us feeling underwhelmed by what they are showcasing as a result of trying too much. <br/><br/>It informed me of the importance of character development in a script,, no matter how good the performances, if the characters are not well established in the screenplay, we will gain no remorse for them. With a very slow pace and unengaging plot, The Danish Girl is worth giving a miss. <br/><br/>A wife is thrown apart when her husband gains a passion for pretending to be a woman. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Alicia Vikander"

I really admire Redmayne for taking up this role. I can't imagine how difficult it must have been. Yet, he does a great job. Vikander is excellent as well. She is a great actress and this movie only confirms it.

The actors did an amazing job in acting out their roles, honestly no other actor could have done it as well. The way the movie was directed and filmed, the soundtrack, and the somber tone glued this movie together and made it into something that I could watch every day and still find incredible. I do not understand the hate that this movie gets; what does it matter if a trans did not play the lead role? Making a movie about a war veteran doesn't mean that the character has to actually be an army retiree. I would recommend this movie to anyone and if they judge me for that, then so be it."

","Based on the fictional novel written by David Ebershoff and loosely inspired on the lives of Danish painters Einar and Gerda Wegener,The Danish Girl tells a story of their marriage as well as the groundbreaking journey of Gerda's husband Einar Wegener into becoming a transgender Lili Elbe during the 1920's in Denmark.It all started when Gerda asked her husband Einar to pose for her as a female model to do her portraits.What started as a game when Einar started wearing female clothing started to reawaken sudden change of feelings and transformation of sexuality from being male to female.It stars Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander as Einar/Lili and Gerda respectively in a film directed by Tom Hooper.Amanda Beard co- stars as the couple's close female friend.<br/><br/>No question that Alicia Vikander deserved winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in last year's Academy Awards.Her willingness to take chances in her role as Gerda has somehow made it a great film.Unfortunately,her performance has somewhat took the film into another direction.Instead of the viewers getting to know more of what made Einar become a transgender,they are treated instead of Gerda's undying love for her husband amidst the changes that have gone through him and her full acceptance for it.The viewers saw more in her character's joy and suffering being the husband of Einar/Lili.<br/><br/>Well,that is not to take away anything from Eddie Redmayne at all.After watching him from Theory Of Everything wherein he won the Oscar for his role as Stephen Hawking,he definitely did extremely well once again in the dual roles of Einar and the complex Lili where he was definitely credible transgender.He was excellent in terms of its role's complexity.It was just too bad that there was simply a lack of explanation in his role as Lili. I myself would not be fully satisfied that simply wearing female clothing and being dressed up as a woman would make Einar feel extremely comfortable with it and would not want to dress as man once again.Besides,I felt that Einar and Gerda' marriage was picture perfect from their relationship together and so was their sex life.Too bad the viewers were simply asked to accept that this sudden change with little explanation in Einar's psychological make- up as well as his personality too.Even his childhood fantasies related by Hans Axgil wasn't enough.It was evident that his character isn't fully developed.<br/><br/>In the end,The Danish Girl became Gerda's film about unrequited love for a husband instead of Einar/Lili to become a landmark transgender film.I somewhat blame the writers for it and Vikander's excellent performance."
"valadas","8","1","2","11 November 2016"," Passionate
","The intense drama of a man awakening for his transsexuality is admirably given in this passionate movie not only for the plot building but also for the excellent performance of its actors chiefly of Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne in the main roles. His drama spreads itself to his loving wife and later on to a childhood friend (Mathias Schoenaerts as the friend Hans Axgil) forming a love triangle. This is based on a veridical actual story of real people that took place in Copenhagen and Paris on early 20th century. The movie develops itself in scenes of great dramatic depth and intensity. In those early times transsexuality was often confused with homossexuality and even classified as insanity. This atmosphere is also somewhat felt in the movie. This is one of the best movies shown in 2015/16."

","I didn't HATE it, but I really think it could have been told better... <br/><br/>To me, the movie wanted the story to have Gerda's perspective, rather than Lili's... The audience is with Gerda every step of the way from when she first encounters Lili as a genuine identity... but we never see Lili find herself, as a child; we're just told about it, and given the explanation that she was 'always there'... <br/><br/>I'm sure that's true, but if so, we needed to see it from the beginning - not have our first introduction be a crass 'dressing up' episode with stockings that the character has to embarrassingly retcon later, with a single line of dialogue. It just gives more fuel to the illusion that it's the outside appearance that matters, not the feelings inside... Since it's the first impression we're given, the lie stays imprinted on our minds, despite the denial later. <br/><br/>It's GERDA that suggests the stockings, and GERDA that suggests Lili come to the reception, when she first kisses Henrik... We see both of these things, but we don't see Lili first experience life on her OWN terms. That makes everything that subsequently happens to her feel instigated by other people - even if this was actually untrue, and not what the film wished to depict."
"modernmonstersdotnet","4","1","2","21 September 2016"," The Movie-ish Girdle
","Another poison-pen love letter to freaks and monsters around, The Danish Girl is, like the pastry of the same name, sugar-glazed heavy fluff. While we all know that Denmark is the happiest place on Earth, something is definitely rotten in the Kingdom; that's why the aftertaste, one guesses. This is a BOATS movie, see, Based On A True Story but reality has been careful edited for the viewer (or is it the voyeur?) to take a stroll by the edge without taking a hard look at the precipice, the sulfurous subject-matter sanitized by soft lightning, period dresses and politically correct dialogue. ""Toddle-oh"", as they often say in Elsinor!<br/><br/>Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne, looking both good and repulsive in lace and satin), and his wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander, happy recipient of an Oscar for supporting role when she is the female lead, a proved studio strategy) are both painters. He's brushing successful, moody landscapes and she's a portraitist, a lesser artistic form in friendly, neighbouringly Copenhagen. But she's definitely wearing the pants in the relationship, while Einar enjoys stockings and lingerie because ""it's pretty"".<br/><br/>It remains unclear what Gerda's endgame is: is she creating an alternate version of herself out of an unfulfilling husband, or the muse for a sea change in her artistic career? The character is ambiguous, expressing thoughts like ""Kissing you was like kissing myself"" or ""I'll never be as pretty as you"". There is, under the layers of varnish, a canvass of cruel rivalry, the wife detaining the compass point at what her chrysalis of a husband should be. Or so she thinks.<br/><br/>Enter the man which will precipitate Einar's metamorphosis, Hans Axgil (Matthias Schoenaerts, sweet as a lamb but almost embarrassingly manly in such a girly environment) He kisses Einar and she becomes Lili, in a reverse frog-to-prince moment. Her nose bleed: she has become a woman. Soon she webbing lies to her suitor and spreading her newfound wings in a dumbfounded small, small capital city where no one ever recognises her for who he, a public figure, was.<br/><br/>Gerda and Lili move to Paris, where their portraitist/model double act is a success, Gerda on the course of becoming Tamara de Lempicka. They are on a see-saw, through. Lili's chemical imbalance has led to a radiation treatment which let him sterile. A painter becoming a model is even more awkward than a model becoming a painter, in an obvious parallel to a man so twisted he would like to becomes a woman. Einar has left the building, both as an artist and as a man; Lili devour him from the inside, a painful process including the mandatory homosexual mugging scene in the Tuileries garden. ""Elbe like the river"", she says when asked her name; she's adrift, drowning in a dark current stronger than both of him/her.<br/><br/>Obviously it does not end well, but in a dignified, symbolic way, a lot being made of a scarf, a confrontation with a pregnant woman emphasizing that gender realignment surgery (as they called it in the Twenties sigh) will never make her a real woman. ""The trick is to only eat sugar"", Lili says at some point when complimented on her figure; the trick here is to film the horror story it is as a treacle treat. The director, Tom Hooper (the atrocious The King's Speech) and his production designer did their homework by pilfering paintings from Villhem Hammershoi and it seems everyone involved enjoyed recreating a monster to observe him/her suffer and die.<br/><br/>As usual, there are two ways of watching this particular exercise of glossing over a subject matter too dark to be used as such. The first is to wonder why to make such a complacent, emasculated Oscar vehicle of it, and be a bit ashamed at having watched it, or even worse, reviewed it. The second, which one guesses is what The Danish Girl deserves, is to consider it a 25 M$ spoof of Little Britain's unconvincing transvestite Emily Howard doing her lady things with her friend Florence, and have a good laugh at it."
"LeonardKniffel","7","1","2","20 July 2016"," The Love of a Good Woman
","The Danish Girl of the title is Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe, as portrayed by Eddie Redmayne, but the film would have been better if it had made Gerda Wegener, as portrayed by Alicia Vikander, the central character. It is her understanding and loyalty--as she learns that the love of her life is a man who believes he should have been born a woman--that is the heart and soul of this film. Redmayne's performance did more to convince this viewer that there is not always a surgical answer to the transgender dilemma. His eye-batting and Princess Diana-ish downward glances reeked of ACTING and made the character seem utterly self-centered. It was the quandary of his loving wife that seemed so sad and was really the most compelling part of the story. Set in the 1920s, the film is also beautiful to watch for its sets and locations."
"mike_diamond","8","1","2","26 June 2016"," Come for the set design, stay for the acting
","The Danish Girl is a story set in Copenhagen in the 1920's about one of the first people to undergo a sex reassignment. Although I was not particularly fond of the pacing or character development, the performances of Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander were some of the strongest of the year. Redmayne's portrayal of Einar/Lili made Jared Leto's portrayal of Rayon in Dallas Buyers Club seem as believable as Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire. Vikander, who had a huge year, was passionate, loving and vulnerable as Einar's wife Gerda in her strongest role to date. The location, set designs and costumes provide a gorgeous context within which to enjoy the performances.<br/><br/>The Danish Girl can be be criticized as Oscar bait, but that accusation infers an elite level of quality. There's no denying that it's a conservative exploration of trans-gendered issues, but it's certainly an accomplished one."
"fadwa-alkhalil","8","1","2","20 June 2016"," Chapeau!
","The Danish Girl is masterful. I had not read the synopsis or any review of the film, so coming into it without background, I found it transporting. For me it was not a transgender question or a social stigma question, so it did not provoke in me a moral righteous reaction to how the subject was handled whether lightly or accurately or offensively to those who have different expectations. For me, the story is an intimate undramatised personal experience of a couple living a threatening and natural transformation. And the actors deliver flawlessly the maturity and honesty and will to find a form that is viable to their continuity. It is an example of how a couple undergoing critical challenges can hold itself by the qualities of real love, of adaptability and a surmounting commitment of being oneself. The film manages to impress on me the behavior of the two towards themselves and with each other, where they could have otherwise easily turned one against the other. This is a story of respect, of sensitizing with the soul, of riveting in nature. Produced with an aesthetic and at a pace that stirs a desire and pleasure in being."
"nicolechan916","9","1","2","13 June 2016"," Electrifying
","First off, let me just address one of the biggest issues people have with the film. That Einar, the transgender woman is played by Eddie Redmayne, who is cisgender - which means someone who conforms their gender to the sex they were born with. (Male/female is the sex, defined by the organs you are born with. Being a man/woman is a social construct which identifies your gender). So Redmayne identifies as a man, which corresponds to him being a male, while Einar, is a male who identifies as a woman (who is trapped inside).<br/><br/>So, at first I did not really have an issue with Redmayne portraying this character. However, I thought about how Asian characters are often played by Westerners, and that made me rethink my opinion. It would have been politically correct to have an actual transgender woman play the character, but having said that, Redmayne does a terrific job. To me anyway.<br/><br/>His performance, is in one word, electrifying. The intense rawness of his character's emotions transcends the screen. Especially the way he moves his hands and positions his body to mimic that of other female characters gives me the chills. He has a wide smile which is sometimes awkward, but can also be quite charming. As the character of Lily becomes more confident, more of her personality comes out. Vikander as well, does great in her role. She embraced her character and it is through her that makes the film more emotional.<br/><br/>The visuals, from the costumes and the color hints, all aided in creating this historic feel of the movie. Because of the nature of the characters' work, the film itself mirrored that and presented itself like paintings too. Costumes and make-up bring characters to life, and the great cinematography brings the narrative to life. Tom Hooper and Danny Cohen do a great job with both intimate close-ups, and wide landscape shots. Always knowing when to use one or the other.<br/><br/>Though this is based on a true story, the romance drama may be a Hollywood addition. That I'm not too keen on. It seems as though Hollywood adds drama to everything, and that makes it a little repetitive and boring. A little more insight into the mind of Einar would have added more depth to the character and the film. <br/><br/>Overall, an amazing film with great mise-en-scene, and electrifying portrayals by Redmayne and Vikander."
"leonblackwood","5","1","2","22 May 2016"," Brilliant performances but it seemed to drag in parts! 5/10
","Review: Although the subject matter was interesting and the performances were brilliant, I did find this movie slightly boring in parts. I felt sorry for Gerda (Alicia Vikander), who had to live through her husband changing into a woman, without any support and whilst trying to keep her career going as an artist. With that aside, the storyline is truly amazing and the outcome at the end did touch me. Eddie Redmayne, Einar/Lili, really did put in a Oscar nomination performance, alongside Alicia Vikander who made the film seem real and extremely emotional. I was amazed that no one recognised who Lili was, when they were out together because you still could see Einar beyond all of the makeup. The transformation was still brilliant from the makeup department and the mannerisms and voice from Redmayne was great. I couldn't work out what exactly Einar did as a job and I would have liked to have seen what happened to Gerda after the dramatic ending but that's just me being picky. The whole operation side of this movie, showed how far Einar was willing to go, to becoming a woman, mainly because she thought that she was born the wrong gender, and there loving relationship was truly beautiful. Anyway, the film did seem to drag in certain parts but I found the message, about one man's journey to become a woman, no matter what the circumstances, very touching and it's great awareness for the transgender community. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Eddie Redmayne, 34, has definitely picked the right projects lately, which include the Theory of Everything, the big budget, Les Miserables and My Week With Marilyn, and this movie has proved that he really does give his all when it comes to delicate subject matters. With the terrible Jupiter Ascending firmly behind him, the only way is up for this Oscar winning actor who stars alongside Colin Farrell in the big budget movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which is due out some time this year. Anyway, this movie was directed by Tom Hooper, 43, who also brought you the Damned United, the Oscar winning, the King's Speech and the questionable Les Miserables. He definitely got the most out of the leading actors and the cinematography portrayed the 1920's well but I personally think that the movie could have been shorter.<br/><br/>Budget: $15million Worldwide Gross: $65million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/romance/dramas starring Eddie Redmayne, Alicia Vikander, Ben Whishaw, Matthias Schoenaerts, Amber Heard and Emerald Fennell. 5/10"

","Watched it on DVD loan from my local public library. Looking up a few details it seems to be a mostly true depiction of what actually occurred. However the 40-something couple in the 1920s are played by much younger actors here.<br/><br/>In short husband and wife are happily married painters. He (Einar) seems to be somewhat more successful (accepted) than she (Gerda) is. In an instance where her normal female model is unavailable she has her husband put on stockings, makeup, and a wig so he can model for her. Doing so seems to trigger a long latent desire for him to actually be a woman. He starts to call himself Lili when dressed as a woman and dresses that way more and more.<br/><br/>This was the 1920s and not so much was known about such transgender feelings and also little about surgery to facilitate a gender reassignment. At one point Einar has to leave town to avoid arrest and forced treatment for his ""crime."" <br/><br/>Perhaps this movie would have had a greater impact a few decades ago, because the recent transgender process for Bruce Jenner, Olympics Decathlon Champion, to become Caitlyn Jenner has been so publicized that a viewer could take a ""ho-hum"" view of this sort of thing. However it is a good movie of an important time of transition and Vikander won the Oscar for best supporting actress. Although Redmane does a remarkable job in his role and might have won Best Actor in a different year.<br/><br/>In spite of the actual topic to me the better story here is of love and commitment, his wife truly loved him, even after he began his transition, she never gets angry or plays the victim, she understands him and supports him. That part of the story can get lost among the rest.<br/><br/>Alicia Vikander is Gerda Wegener and Eddie Redmayne is Einar Wegener who becomes Lili Elbe. Unfortunately, as history tells us, Lili did not survive her last surgery, probably a result of organ rejection."

","For once, I fully agree with the Academy's decision to nominate both Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander for their roles. Individually they are both talented young actors (who can forget Redmayne in The Theory of Everything and Vikander in Deus Ex Machina ?), but here they managed to show real chemistry on screen and, as a result, watching those two interact with each other is a real treat! They form a really cute couple! <br/><br/>The subject matter is a complicated one and overall The Danish Girl is a drama, but there's also a romance there, and overall I felt that the tone of the movie was quite uplifting and not overly dramatic, contrary to a lot of Oscar's contenders. Much of this has to do - I think - with the subtle yet powerful way the two main actors deliver their lines and show their emotions. The rest of the cast does a great job of supporting them, especially Matthias Schoenaerts and Ben Whishaw.<br/><br/>It's hard not to notice the parallel between Gerda and Einar's job as painters and the cinematography : lots of scenes seem to be taken from a painting. Or is it the other way around ? I thought it was a really nice touch and helped give the film a unique visual identity.<br/><br/>The fact that parts of the movie were shot in Brussels, in places I love (the Royal Galleries and Park, the famous ""A La Mort Subite"" café) probably made me appreciate this movie more than I would normally, but still, this is an excellent, beautiful movie that I wholeheartedly recommend! 9 out of 10."
"DavidLindahl","6","1","2","7 April 2016"," A beautiful portrayal of a transgender man and his wife
","The successful British director Tom Hooper, who made big films like The King's Speech and Les Misérables, here takes on the true story about one of the world's first sex changes. Eddie Redmayne plays Einar Wegener who changes his sex and becomes the woman Lili Elbe. Alicia Vikander plays Einar's wife Gerde. They both deliver fantastic Oscar nominated performances. The Danish Girl is an important film not only about a sex change, but also LGBT rights and above all transsexual people's right to a life of their own choosing.<br/><br/>The main focus of the film is actually not directly on Einar/Lili, and we as an audience sees most of it all through the eyes of the wife Gerda. I am a bit divided in my opinion about this because it makes us a spectator, but when the main plot focuses on Einar/Lili and we follow it through Gerde's eyes, we still barely get to know her. She functions mainly as support to Einar/Lili. It would have been interesting to make the film entirely from the perspective of Einar/Lili. Make us the audience become her, feel and understand how she feels. Gerda could have been a supporting character on the side. This also becomes more clear with the fact that Redmayne, nominated for the leading role has less screen time than Vikander who is nominated for a supporting role.<br/><br/>I think The Danish Girl is a good film you must see. It does take certain liberties with the story, compared to the truth, but most likely to make it more exciting on film. This does not bother me because the film's message is more important than an exact truthful story. I do however think it would have been better if we were to follow the film more from the perspective of Einar/Lili than Gerde. Make us really enter her head, make us understand how she feels. Otherwise, the film is incredibly beautiful to watch. The costumes, the production design and the cinematography is extraordinary, plus beautiful music by Alexandre Desplat.

Those stark scenes were successful in conveying the sense of loneliness that pervades the life of Lili, the central character, Lili Elbe.<br/><br/>Because Lili and Gerda Wegener were both painters, the film offered a stylish approach to the environments that supported the main themes of the film.

The screenplay was completely neglected in favour of the film's visual aspect, and this - in my opinion - made any kind of connection between characters and viewers impossible. <br/><br/>Alicia Vikander gave a laudable (but still academic) performance, stealing the whole attention from Redmayne (also good, but understandably uncertain due to the difficult role); other than that, I can't find anything else I liked about the movie - apart from the amazing soundtrack composed by Alexandre Desplat.<br/><br/>This movie had a great potential: it could have been provocative, emotional, powerful. So how is it that 'The Revenant' - whose plot is common and even predictable - still amazed me and made me feel a lot more than such a tragic and extraordinary story as Lili's?"
"scottshak_111","8","1","2","10 March 2016"," A powerful movie! Eddie delivers an enthralling performance.
","The Danish Girl is a self-realization sojourn of Einar Wegener, a top-notch landscape painter from Denmark, who unfurls gradually into his true identity. Never leaving his side in a full supportive backdrop is Gerda Wegener, played superbly by Alicia Vikander, who depicts a gorgeous shade of loyal love.<br/><br/>The movie leaves you wondering how bold and resolute Einar Wegner really was, to have pioneered the trans-gender transformation. In an era of hush-hush, where people looked at you differently, Einar managed to do something extraordinary and unorthodox that is worth an ovation. He wasn't really bothered about what people might say or do. He just cared about finding what he was, in an unwavering fashion.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The story leaves you in tears owing to the ""Gerda-persistence"". Not for a second does she stop loving her husband, and accepts Einar's true identity and helps him to achieve his transformation. She wavers once, but that was it. Where will you find such altruistic love? The performance of Eddie Redmayne is mind numbing as Lili. He wears all the womanly expressions to perfection, with the slight but right blush, blinking of his eyes and that crimsoned smile, he just nails every bit like a pro. So reassuring is his performance that he gets lost into it completely. Really convincing! The music and screenplay are simply outstanding. Well played and intelligently written. Acting A1! Plot superbly woven.<br/><br/>Some bits in the movie unknowingly walk into the clichéd territory, for instance when two French guys beat the crap out of Einar, also the fact that Gerda is crushed 'neath her loyalty towards her husband and requited love, seem more like a revisited enclave.<br/><br/>As The Danish Girl rambles to fruition, the movie begins losing its dramatic quotient and charm that had so brilliantly managed to keep us riveted. Editing goes a little bit dodgy there, and it loses its rhythm. The quiet is overshadowed by the shaky focus as frames change one after the other beating melodrama to pulp. Although right at the climax it peaks once again and makes up for all of it. But, still you are compelled to feel something wasn't quite right during the last bits.<br/><br/>However, overall the movie did justice to the trans-gender pioneer and the girl who never left his side, Gerda the true hero. A splendid flick!"

","Transgender issues are finally being discussed and studied at length, and while we have no idea how widespread the numbers of people born in the wrong sexual receptacles is, it really makes no difference. This film is about the first trans gender reassignment surgery and that aspect works very well as a treatise on etiology and progress of the initial surgical candidate, but the film is more than that; this is a very powerful love story and therein lies its significance. It demonstrates the power and need for finding true, unconditional love. Based on a true story as written by David Ebershoff and adapted for the screen by Lucinda Coxon and direct with tremendous sensitivity by Tom Hooper, the true reason the film works so well is the quality of acting by the two lead characters and their supporting cast.<br/><br/>The setting is Copenhagen in 1926 (introduced by stunningly beautiful landscape photography which will be reflected in the main characters paintings). Danish artist, Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander), painted her own artist husband, Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne), as a lady in her painting. When the painting gained popularity, Einar started to change his appearance into a female appearance and named himself Lili Elbe. With his feminism passion and Gerda's support, Einar - or Elbe - attempted one of the first male-to-female sex reassignment surgery, a decision that turned into a massive change for their marriage, that Gerda realized her own husband is no longer a man or the person she married before. After a brief romantic dalliance with the handsome Henrik (Ben Whishaw), a childhood friend of Einar, art-dealer Hans Axgil (Matthias Schoenaerts), shows up and starts a complex love triangle with the couple. We are privy to the medical workup both by the dubious Dr. Hexler (Pip Torrens) and the genteel surgeon Dr Warenekros (Sebastian Koch) and the manner in which the surgeries proceed. <br/><br/>But the most important sense we gain from this long movie is the strength of character of both Gerda and Einear/Lili as played with consummate skill By Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne. The always-reliable Alexandre Desplat supplies the musical score and Danny Cohen the cinematography. Eloquent and memorable."
"mari-ka","8","1","2","2 March 2016"," a Bad Good film
","I just saw the movie and, yes I liked it, but now I know why Eddie didn't win the Oscar and why Alicia Vikander did. She was amazing. She didn't play a supporting role, her character was just as important as Eddie's. About Eddie, I think that he was the problem of the movie because even though he should have been the star of the story he wasn't. I believe that he established a level of acting with ""The Theory of Everything"" that will be hardly reached again. When I say bad movie, it's because it was impossible for me to concentrate on the evolution of Lili because I was more focused on Gerda's feelings and point of view. In the end, though, I'm still happy they made a movie on such an important and very much discussed topic, and I think that being a transgender is very difficult, especially in the reality of a couple. When I think about this movie the only thing I can say is that, yes it is a really good one, but they have decided to make this movie only for the current American situation and we can see the results. I think that in order to be a masterpiece they should have put their focus on the various aspects of the process and not just the transition."
"kingwyatt","9","1","2","29 February 2016"," Good Story Telling and Acting on a challenging subject matter
","The movie does a good job of telling the story. It was interesting as a period piece and a love story. The struggle of self discovery during a time when there are no others, no awareness and no language to express the feelings of being in body for which the gender is in congruent with ones feelings is compelling and I believe authentic. I found the acting to be excellent. Some are unhappy with the portrayal but often people are critical of portrayals when they experience them in a different time and environment. I found the struggle and the love of these people heart breaking, touching and warm. Watch it without expectation, have an open mind and an open heart. Then go read about the real life characters this movie is based upon."
"jtindahouse","8","1","2","19 February 2016"," Redmayne and Vikander deliver incredible performances
","There's no denying 'The Danish Girl' is carried by the two lead actors. It's on OK script dealing with an interesting subject but these two, Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander, delivering the performances they did certainly helped the watch-ability factor. The subject of transgender people isn't always an easy one to understand or deal with and I suspect people who didn't like the film likely fall into the category of finding it an uncomfortable watch. The main reason it's uncomfortable is because Redmayne is so damn good. The man can act, there's simply no denying that.<br/><br/>Getting one Oscar worthy performance in a film is an accomplishment, two though is astonishing. Both Redmayne and Vikander have been nominated for Academy Awards, Redmayne in a Lead Role, Vikander in a Supporting Role (the latter's category being quite contentious considering she had more screen time than Redmayne did). The scary fact is that they're both good enough to win too, or at least they would be if a certain man called Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't in the running. DiCaprio has the award locked up sadly, but I truly believe Redmayne was better in his actual acting performance. DiCaprio is getting the award for the sacrifices he made for his role and the commitment it took. However, if you took two average movie viewers and gave them no background about either actor and asked them which performance they found better, I think a very high percentage would pick Redmayne. He won last year with an incredible performance and deserved to do so again this year in my opinion.<br/><br/>Vikander on the other hand I suspect will win, and deservedly so. This was the first film I had ever seen her in and she blew me away. Her presence on screen was immense and her performance showed all the layers of a truly great actress. The only thing marring her nomination is whether she should be in the Supporting Actress category or not. I would have to agree she probably should not have been. I kept thinking to myself she must somehow exit this film halfway through in order for it to classify as 'Supporting'. However she did not and while I hate to take away from an undoubtedly great performance, it is hard for others in the category to compete when they are getting much less screen time.<br/><br/>The film wasn't nominated for Best Picture despite being right up the alley for that type of nod. The story isn't entirely fact based and is more a work of fiction based on true characters, which may have hurt it. It also, as previously mentioned, isn't the easiest subject for everyone to stomach. All things aside though I'd have to say I enjoyed it a lot more than a few other films that did get a Best Picture nod. No one's complaining too much that it's not there it seems, but make no mistake, it's a fine film."
"CineMuseFilms","9","1","2","11 February 2016"," Its like watching a newborn chick push its way through the shell of an egg
","This extraordinary film is a two-headed hydra that swings between an exquisitely beautiful study of how little separates the genders, and a dark biopic of social prejudice against those who want release from their birth gender. Based loosely on the first recorded case of gender reassignment surgery, it's a story of married Danish artists Einar and Gerda Wegener whose relationship is transformed when Einar is encouraged by his wife to express the feminine self trapped within him.<br/><br/>The acting virtuosity of Eddie Redmayne as Einer is the beating heart of this film, just as he was the very soul of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything (2015). Starting as a playful game between two creative aesthetes, Einer incrementally explores coming out as a woman in a society not ready to even name people like him. At times melodramatic, the film is like watching a newborn chick push its way through the shell of an egg: one faint crack becomes several and suddenly a new life form emerges, bewildered by the public gaze and nowhere to hide.<br/><br/>The cinematography is lush and painterly. Several scenes incorporate original Wegener portraits and landscapes to create a living art gallery where Einar metaphorically paints himself into herself as Lili, the camera dwelling on feminine rituals that show the transformational power of cosmetic and fashion adornments. Some of the multi-depth close-up shots are themselves masterpieces that frame original paintings with their live subject in sets that resemble an artist's canvas. As Lili experiences the sexual advances of males, she yearns for a cure for the ""sickness"" of wrong genitalia. It's a sensitive portrayal of a complex issue for many who, like Lili, were prepared to risk their lives with pre-modern surgery to be who they wanted to be. Not all viewers will want to share that journey, but those who respect it will have much to admire in this film."

But I do not think the film is what this true(ish) story deserved. Lily and Gerda's story is a pivotal moment in LGBT and human history and so I couldn't help but feel a tad underwhelmed by this movie.<br/><br/>The acting is good, Eddie Redmayne plays a Eddie Redmayneish trans gender martyr and Alicia Vikander deserves the Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as the supportive wife with ambitions and problems of her own.<br/><br/>On reflection if you are going to make a character piece about a trans gender woman wouldn't it be best to hire a trans gender Director as to get a full understanding of what the character would be feeling and what they are going through? Not that I believe that Tom Hooper was a terrible director, I just think the complexity of the character would have been better understood and conveyed on screen by someone who can relate with Lily<br/><br/>Overall the Danish Girl is alright.

"lucasnochez","5","1","2","3 February 2016"," TIFF40 2015 Film Review: The Danish Girl
","Tom Hooper seems to be the period piece go-to director for by-the-numbers Oscar films. After the immense success of the little indie that could The King's Speech gaining massive momentum at TIFF in 2010, going on to win the coveted Best Picture Oscar; then the grand and highly ambitious Les Miserables, Hooper seemed to have crafted a career out of production rich designs, strong performances and historically relevant social issues in his films. With the addition of Eddie Redmayne, fresh off his Oscar winning role in last year's The Theory of Everything, Hooper's newest The Danish Girl was expected to come out a clear winner. Sadly, The Danish Girl is a confused, highly theatrical and poorly constructed transparent film with laughable dialogue between its two leads Redmayne and rising star Alicia Vikander. The Danish Girl seemed to be a foolproof, sure-fire bet for success; Redmayne was coming off his Oscar win as Stephen Hawkings; the first look photo of the film of Redmayne in drag gained immense buzz online; Hooper finally got a project off the ground after many years of being shelved by studios and various directors; its female lead Alicia Vikander had four major roles in 2015 with nothing but great buzz, and finally, the cast rounded out with the grandly talented Matthias Schoenaerts. Yet, Hooper's The Danish Girl came across as a forced, highly contrived Oscar wannabe film with pretentious camera tricks, dizzying angles and weak vehicle for any kind of lead up to have Redmayne the first actor to win two back-to-back lead actor Oscars.<br/><br/>Set in 1926, in what could be described as Hooper's historically hipster-era in Copenhagen, the film follows Gerda Wegener (Vikander) and Einar Wegener (Redmayne), a very passionate, close- knit painting couple who cherish the high art culture of Copenhagen, including its posh parties, galas and presentations. Along for the ride, is their close friend and confident floozy Oola Paulson (Amber Heard), who motivates the couple to partake in the lavish cultural niche of the country, without much else.<br/><br/>In a desperate attempt to finish up a recent portrait for her upcoming, impending gallery showcase, Gerda asks her loving and supportive husband Einar, to place the painted dress on, along with some nylons and heals. As Einar caresses and is seduced by the fabrics of the garment, he becomes transfixed, mind, body and soul, with the crazy idea of becoming a woman. As Oola enters the couples apartment, in preparation for another trendy evening gather, jokingly names Einar's female counterpart Lili. Unbeknownst to them at the time, the origins of Lili would just be the start of Gerda's and Einar's life.<br/><br/>Transgenderism is a huge and highly talked about social issue in many art forms today, especially within the visual medium. With shows like ""Transparent"", ""Orange is the New Black"" and others making waves, it's no surprise that Hollywood busted out an origin film of one of the first successful trans-gender stories and operations recorded. Sadly, The Danish Girl, while trying to be trend-setting and a wavelengths type film for the truly difficult realities for many, serves as a laughable and pretentious story of over-dramatic film aesthetics and acting.<br/><br/>Scorn with painful editing, inauspicious mood-setting scoring and less than hubris camera angles and filing styles, it seems as though Hooper forgot to focus on his characters and their difficult and revolutionary small details. For example, when Gerda tries to persuade Einar to coming to a party with her, which he declines vivacious, she convinces him to come as Lili, for fun and merely as a joke. While Einar's transformation and changing montage is brief, unlike those clichéd high school prom films that has the big transformation of its lead female protagonist as she goes from ugly duckling to beautiful swan, Lili has no big reveal; merely a quick shot of her walking the streets, rushing to the party with Gerda. Hooper takes for granted so much of the importance of Einar to Lili, and focuses on a very muddled and hard to define relationship between a man and a woman; lovers to friends; wife to cousin?<br/><br/>Danish pastries are famous for being laminated, multi-layered and delicate. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Danish Girl. Burnt to a crisp with overacting and some poor make-up and costume choices, the film does offer some saving graces thanks mostly to an astonishing performance by Alicia Vikander and Matthias Schoenaerts, and a very special and one of the rare believable scenes of Redmayne through a looking glass. Vikander, who counterbalances Redmayne's manic behaviour and inability to vocalize how he feels he is meant to be a woman, Vikander's gentle touch to Gerda's character brings true emotions of how any partner and loved one would deal with a very radical decision today, and more so in 1926 Europe. Vikander, who is bound to land some Oscar love come earlier next year, gently graces the screen with perfectly timed drama, poise and a gentle touch. Schoenaerts, who is a period-piece veteran, offers his masterful acting skills as an old-friend to Einar and new friend to Gerda, playing a very similar role as Charlie Cox's character Jonathan in The Theory of Everything, his passion to aid, understand and stand on the sidelines of a very unique circumstance is one of the winning areas of the film."
"LivBrumei","8","1","2","30 January 2016"," A present reality from a past prospect
","I only decided to write this review because of the several comments about not understanding the movie, that I saw after watching it. It's only my opinion, but I thing this movie isn't rated according to it's quality. Transgender it's now a reality, in many countries it is now legal to change gender. About 50 years ago or whatsoever, I wasn't born and I can't say how things were, but considering history it certainly wasn't even predicted in the law and wouldn't be easily accepted in society. What we see with The Danish Girl is probably the first case reported where the person that didn't feel she was in the correct body had the courage and the support to try and change that! Some people say that there are parts in the movie they don't understand how the character could be seen as a woman...well I think this is a bit of a detail and apart from movie opinions and more about life opinions, there are several people that I have wondered about their gender, so I guess this isn't the main question. For me.. what I saw was an interesting story where Alicia Vikander's performance really touch me. I have never seen any situation like this, but one of her lines, when she is talking to Lily and says ""I need to see my husband"", that really got to me and showed how difficult this process must be for everyone involved, the person in question and everyone who loves them. So overall the story line is interesting, Alcia Vikander totally makes it worth and I really believe it's a good way to bring attention for transgender reality. Of course if you don't care for these things, it's not the movie for you. Is it the best movie of the season? I don't think so, but if you do like movies about people then it will be two interesting hours."

","""The Danish Girl"" is a 2-hour film from 2015 that deals with the lives of Gerda Wegener and Lili Elbe. For writer David Ebershoff and screenplay writer Lucinda Coxon, this British production is the biggest success of their career so far. A lot of it has to do with Academy Award winner Tom Hooper being in charge behind the camera here. And even if he missed out on nominations, his film is one of the big players this awards season with 4 Oscar nominations. Alicia Vikander (demoted to supporting) has a true shot at winning in my opinion. I believe she was good, not great, but certainly better than her competitors Winslet and Mara.<br/><br/>In the center of the film, however, is Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne's turn as a woman trapped in a man's body. It sure was a courageous endeavor she went on in terms of society and medicine when she makes the decision to go through with her plan of becoming a woman. The film features many actors I have never heard of for the smaller parts, but the likes of Ben Whishaw, Matthias Schoenaerts and Sebastian Koch are certainly familiar faces for film lovers.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the hell out of Hooper's last full feature film, ""Les Misérables"", which already had a strong performance by Redmayne too, so I cannot say I liked his newest film as much as I liked his previous, but it was still a pretty decent watch for the most part of its 120 minutes. Redmayne gracefully walks the fine line between over-the-top and authentic from start to finish and deserves his Oscar nomination too. There were a couple very moving moments and the film is almost never cringeworthy, which is a strong achievement for a movie that has a man walking around in drag for roughly 90 minutes. I recommend ""The Danish Girl"". It's nowhere near the best of 2015 in terms of films, but the two strong lead performances and the interesting story as well as the fine visual work are certainly worth checking out. Thumbs up."

","You (like me) may have admired Eddie Redmayne in the TV version of Tess of the D'Urbervilles (2008), in My Week with Marilyn (2011), as Marius in Les Miserables 2012), and as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything (Academy Award, 2014). You still may be surprised at how moving his delicate performance is in The Danish Girl. I knew vaguely what this movie was about—very ""loosely based"" on the lives of mid-1920s Danish painters Einar and Gerda Wegener. Despite their happy and loving marriage, Einar comes to realize he is a woman in a man's body. ""Lili,"" as his alter ego is named, is at first a diversion for the pair, then a painful inevitability, and Einar becomes one of the first people to undergo sex-reassignment surgery. Both of them suffer because of Lili's condition and the strains it places on their love, yet they desperately try to make some kind of relationship work. Yet it's dangerous to be a pioneer. While Redmayne is superb, he's matched in nuanced expressiveness by Swedish actor Alicia Vikander as Gerda. The delicious Matthias Schoenaerts plays Einar's childhood friend, Hans, with whom a frantic Gerda reconnects while the couple is in Paris. Ben Whishaw also appears, determined to court the shy Lili, or is it Einar he recognizes and pursues? Not much was known about transgender identities in 1925, and the medical practitioners with whom the couple shares its secret propose predictably draconian measures. But the real drama is watching Redmayne transform himself into a female being. Says Nathan Heller's Vogue article, ""He is no longer recognizable as a 33-year-old man; suddenly, the flash strikes his face and the transformation is complete."" The film, directed by Tom Hooper with a script by English playwright Lucinda Coxon, is based on the 2000 David Ebershoff novel. Due to Coxon's diligent research, the movie actually contains numerous factual details not in the book. Tim Gray's interview with Coxon for Variety reveals that the film is actually closer to what really happened than either the novel or Lili Elbe's pastiche of a ""memoir,"" which was, Coxon told Gray, ""a work of many hands."""

","I would also give this film an 8 out of 10 for cringe too, for the people who hate awkwardness, like me, I would give this one a miss. Whilst Eddie is a stellar actor, and his performance is quite incredible as a woman, there are parts of the film that are pretty strange, as he starts to wear women's clothes more and more, in which his wife simply glazes over. I think that this film probably could have ended better, and been closer to how it was in real life, but regardless of how you look at it Gerda, played by Alicia Vikander, either in real life or in the film, really gets the crap in life. My girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed this film calling it powerful and emotionally draining, people who enjoy Brokeback Mountain will probably enjoy this."

","This film is an abstract painting drew by performance. Screen is canvas,all these roles are different colors been painted on it by the brush called performance. Behind these beautiful colors,there's a sad but beautiful story about this person Einar Wegener.<br/><br/>Einar Wegener is a man dresses as a woman named Lili,at home and in public. People are wondering,what's going on with him.Is he a homosexual? Has he got a second personality?Is he insane?<br/><br/>No. Einar Wegener is a performance junkie. Einar Wegener has been married six years.His wife is a strong beautiful woman.He loves his wife. But they still don't have a child of their own.He's worried about future.His real life is tedious. Performance is his pain killer. Henrik is also a user and a drug dealer .Ever since he tasted something stronger from Henrik at Artist Ball, he's addicted to it. He realized he can't live without performance.Performance is his life.<br/><br/>Lili is not a second personality of Einar Wegener, it's a role he created and he needs a stage to perform it,to bring Lili alive. <br/><br/>Einar Wegener enjoys performing and he's got talent. He used this Artist Ball as stage,first time,he performed Lili. But Einar Wegener is not a performer,he's a painter. His performance is immature. His bad performance made everybody confused.Except Henrik. Henrik can see flaws of his performance.And he used them to get what he wants. Cause Henrik's a better performer at that time.<br/><br/>Einar Wegener also enjoys the love from audience.Hans,Ulla,others.And his wife. The reaction of these audiences effected him,helped him created this role,Lili. His wife is a special audience to him. He loves his wife,his best and very last performance is for her.<br/><br/>Real life forced Einar Wegener to be a performer.Fortunately he enjoys it.He's good performer. At last,his performance so convincing that everybody and his wife believes he's a woman. His dream come true.<br/><br/>Watching this film is a special experience. At different time,in different ways,different people can see different things in it, Some people can see everything in it,some just can't see anything. It's just like standing in front of an abstract painting."

","I saw this movie last night, and wanted to comment on it. In reading through the more constructive reviews of others here (I do not include in that group transphobes that despise the subject matter), it's clear that both the good and the bad of this movie have already been identified. <br/><br/>I found the acting crisp throughout. I had no trouble believing that Eddie Redmayne playing a transgendered role; his naturally rather androgynous looks helps in that regard. Alicia Vikander was absolutely spectacular working with a script that gave her very little. The rest of the cast provided memorable scene stealing moments.<br/><br/>Others here have already commented on the cinematography; it was spectacular. I felt like I was seeing two hours of fine paintings. <br/><br/>The biggest problem was with the script that didn't explore the souls of Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. You see the turmoil in Lili, but there is no effort to give it context. You see Gerda responding rather nobly to her husband's pain, but there is no attempt to understand the motivation behind her sacrifice. You are presented with sympathetic peripheral characters throughout, but they are all one dimensional.<br/><br/>I went to this movie hoping to connect and cry, and I only came close to that in a couple of scenes near the end. Yet I do regard this as a very important movie. It does say a lot about how far we have come, as well as how far we need to go. The intellectual roots of both today's transgender community, and today's transphobes are on display here."
"aporlando","10","2","9","3 January 2016"," Eddie Redmayne, this is one actor you should follow!
","Never have I watched a movie which there was this much to comment on. The cinematographer responsible for the film gave us some amazing images from the area the story took place. Reflections on the water from the shore, structures each painted a different color could be seen. The period of time was also reflected in this film work.<br/><br/>But there is so much more to be seen in this movie, such as the acting of Alicia Vikander, and Eddie Redmayne. Surprised to see a modern made film which had such superb acting leaving you believing that neither of these actors were actually pretending to play a role. I find this fascinating because usually a person sees a movie actor which leaves you feeling that they were hired to be themselves in the movie, hence there is no such thing as acting. My hat is off especially for Eddie Redmayne, this is one actor you should follow in what is obvious future in his acting career. <br/><br/>Looking deeper, there is something else to comment about. The story line although one may think it is obvious, another look at this film you may see what the actors try to tell us. The story is way more than it's theme about Einar in the movie. Gerda says out loud her complaint, when you watch this film try not to miss her message. Yet all the time she stands by her husband knowing she has no place here, and feels terribly left out. The writer seems complex, yet the message straight forward. <br/><br/>I enjoyed being a part of this movie, and thank everyone who helped make this movie happen. It was nice to watch a film that makes you feel wrapped up into it."

","Tom Hooper's The Danish Girl tells the story of one of the first transgender females, at least one of the first, if not THE first one to undergo the sex change surgery. Set in 1926, the sets are very well designed and accurate to the time period. The makeup used in the film is fantastic, very beautiful classic style of makeup, the makeup has to be good for a film of this kind, it just has to be. The sequence where Einer is putting on his makeup for the first time is breathtaking visually and very well done. I loved the costume design for each individual character, especially lili. The costumes that lili wore suited her so very well and she looked absolutely beautiful in all of them. And Alicia Vikander looks great in both her makeup and tee various costumes. Now we get to the best part of the entire film, and that is the performances by the actors. We'll start with the academy award winning performance given by Alicia Vikander. Vikander gives a truly moving, deep performance that is rooted in love and rife with strong emotion throughout. Her character goes through a lot as you can imagine. Eddie Redmayne is such a marvelous actor! He plays both Einer and lili sooo well. The way in which he behaves, talks and behaves as lili is so skilled and natural, you never feel like you're watching Eddie act, it feels real. There are a couple of scenes I would like to recognize because they were so needed and crucial to this film. One scene is where Einer is nude in front of a mirror and he tucks his penis in between his legs and it looks like he now has a vulva, this is a crucial scene that HAD to be included, it showcase his character's journey to self discovery. Another is Einer visiting a peep show to see a nude woman and see how she moves and examine/mimic her mannerisms, another scene showcasing self discovery. I feel the ending was handled fairly well, no complaints about that. Moving, well acted, visually great looking and important story. 8/10"

","I didn't know the story before i watched it, so i only read a simple page on Wikipedia to have just few informations about it. The deal is HUGE and i was impatient to see it for the story i read. I was also curious cos i read, on a blog, that Leonardo Di Caprio was running for the Oscar title with Eddie Redmayne. I loved The Revenant, so i wanted to have an opinion on both movies.<br/><br/>Big disappointment. Redmayne, as we last saw him in (Jupiter apart) The Theory of Everything, was another actor. It gave me the chills at the beginning, i didn't know how to react to an original story and issue like this one and i started it with the idea ""ok, let's see how i react"". Hooper could have done so much more for such a delicate issue, he did everything not to do it. OK, the only positive sides i found were the landscapes (amazing, it was really like staring at a paint) and the acting of Alicia Vikander, who i barely known and was a pleasant discover. But the rest, come on. A movie this important should have taken 2.30/3 hours to enlarge the main idea and to well understand the sense. Einar/Lilli (Redmayne) gave me nothing, i liked the first ""creepy"" smiles and the face-expressions the first 5 times, then, mostly annoying or really creepy, they made fly away the magical that could have communicated if only remained 5. Same moves, same looks, same frames over and over. OK, Hooper maybe wanted us to know this inner passage Einar made with himself, but after a while, boring and meaningless. The main point was the psychological journey he/she did, and the relationship with Gerda, but for like an hour it looked to me like i re-winded the movie from the beginning, stuck. The end wasn't the central deal, but they spent barely 20 minutes on the operations, on how she felt and the last scenes let me like ""ok, and now? Finished already? what just happened?"". 6/10 just for Gerda/Alicia and for the amazing set, nothing more. Not gonna re-watch it and i hope Redmayne's gonna leave the place for Leo, cos this year, he doesn't really deserve it.<br/><br/>(Sorry in advance for my English)"

","As night fell on Christmas Eve, National Public Radio was in its usual holy-day mode, using your tax dollars to mock the traditional Christian creed. This time they promoted an activist movie called The Danish Girl, yet another alleged ""true story"" about artist Einar Wegener, a married man who wanted to be a woman named Lili. An earlier NPR commercial – sorry, ""underwriting announcement"" – said he was the first recipient of ""gender confirmation surgery.""<br/><br/>Paging Mr. Orwell – it's NPR on line 1. Focus Features – part of the Comcast ""diversity and inclusion"" empire of propaganda – is calling this maiming of the male body ""gender confirmation surgery.""<br/><br/>As Einar/Lili, Oscar-winning actor Eddie Redmayne proclaims before amputation, ""God made me a woman. The doctor is curing me of the sickness that was my disguise."" It's just another LGBT heresy, carefully placed under your pine tree at the NPR holiday party. <br/><br/>God did not do this; it is man attempting to undo what God created. But let's continue.<br/><br/>Openly gay NPR All Things Considered anchor Ari Shapiro asked Redmayne: ""Just in the last year or two, trans awareness in America has exploded, whether it's Laverne Cox on the cover of Time magazine, Jeffrey Tambor winning awards for his performance in Transparent and on and on and on. Do you think the world reacts differently to this film because of the awareness that has grown so much recently?""<br/><br/>Redmayne replied ""I hope so, because the education that I had in the three or four years of preparing, I feel like is now entering the mainstream media. And the world is being educated. And what is astounding is some of the, you know, the discrimination or the violence that Lili lived through is still so rife across the world, I mean, particularly, sort of job -- you can be fired in 32 states for being trans.""<br/><br/>The world is being ""educated"" by Hollywood and the ""mainstream media."" Redmayne proclaimed to be so affected by playing the gender-confused man: ""When you, as an actor, meet people and people share their experience, one also feels a sense of responsibility. And certainly, I've been trying to learn to be an ally to the community in any way that I can.""<br/><br/>This is just one day's example of how flagrantly NPR mocks the name of its show All Things Considered. No one is allowed to rebut Redmayne's Christmas Eve ""trans ally"" sermonizing with facts or, even worse, Christian teaching. <br/><br/>Despite Focus Features advertising this film as a ""true story"" and a ""true love story,"" it's based on a novel, not on real life. Einar Wegener and his wife Gerda's ""love story"" crumbled. Gerda was not even present during Einar's last operation and death, but was living in Italy with her second husband, Fernando Porta. <br/><br/>In a 1933 book that's listed as an inspiration for the movie, Man Into Woman: The First Sex Change Operation, it's reported that Einar was so twisted that he believed that with the transplant of the ovaries of a woman in her twenties, he had become young again (""an age that corresponds to my physical development as a woman""). He was so infatuated with the surgeon who killed him in an attempted uterus transplant that he asked if the operations could be under local anesthesia so he could watch him at work. <br/><br/>All that madness is submerged for the radical politics. The movie's final credits proclaim that Einar's ""bravery and pioneering spirit remains an inspiration for today's transgender movement."" <br/><br/>The only disturbance to this progressive force, naturally, is the radicals hate it. A ""cisgender male"" plays the ""transgender icon,"" so it's never quite progressive enough. But for the media elites trying to propel a ""movement,"" it's quite good enough. Are the Golden Globes and Oscars for building ""awareness"" coming next?"

","THE DANISH GIRL is a surprisingly unworkable historical drama from the director behind THE KING'S SPEECH. It's about a Danish couple whose loves were thrown into turmoil by the husband's decision to transition into a woman in an era when such a thing was unheard of. Based on a true story, this is notable for featuring big name actor Eddie Redmayne trying to recapture some of the glory he gained in playing Stephen Hawking in THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, but it's second time unlucky for the actor. Where his performance as Hawking convinced, here he seems extremely superficial, merely fluttering his eyelashes a lot in his attempt to convince as a woman born in a man's body. The whole thing is slow and dragged out to a turgid pace, and all of the cast feel icy cold and unsympathetic. Alicia Vikander is miscast as the wife and looks and acts like a petulant child for a lot of the running time. It's an unremarkable film I really struggled to finish."
"Red-125","Null","1","6","5 January 2016"," This movie is much better than its rating would indicate.
","The Danish Girl (2015) was directed by Tom Hooper. This film is loosely based on the life of Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne), a Danish artist who realized that he was a woman trapped in a man's body. That's not a strange concept now, but in the 1920's it was considered not only strange, but psychotic. Eventually, Einar becomes Lili Elbe, and she considers having the pioneering surgery for a sex-role change. Again, hardly shocking now, but the surgery had never been performed before.<br/><br/>Alicia Vikander plays Einar's wife, Gerda Wegener, who is naturally confused and horrified as her husband turns into Lili. After a while, she accepts that her husband really is Lili. In fact, Gerda supports Lili through this extraordinarily challenging time, <br/><br/>Both of the lead actors do superb work. The film would fail without two solid performances in these two parts. In addition, the remainder of the cast is excellent. <br/><br/>The film is filled with gorgeous images of Copenhagen, Paris, and Dresden. That positive aspect of the movie is also a negative aspect. Director Hooper wants us to know where we are. So, when we are in Copenhagen, we get endless views of the waterfront market. The women at the market stalls all wear hats made of folded newspaper. After the sixth or seventh establishing shot, I wanted to call out, ""OK--we understand. Market. Hats. This is Copenhagen."" <br/><br/>When we get to Paris, Hooper actually makes sure that we see the Eiffel Tower. ""OK--got it. This is Paris."" He doesn't do as well with Dresden. Still, there's on market and no Eiffel Tower, so it had to be Dresden.<br/><br/>As I write this review ""The Danish Girl"" has an abysmal IMDb rating of 6.4. Almost as many people rated it ""1"" as rated it ""10."" It's a much better film than 6.4. My guess is that some of the people who gave it a low rating did so because they are uncomfortable with the depiction of transgender people. My suggestion to you--find ""The Danish Girl"" and watch it. Don't let the low rating cause you to miss this important movie.<br/><br/>We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It should work almost as well on the small screen."

This is a tale of fiction based on the real lives of a Danish couple who took part in the first male to female sex change operation, and we follow their emotional turbulent journey as Einer takes on the life of Lili, and how Gerda his wife, alternates between supporting and rejecting her husband. A childhood friend of Einer's becomes an unlikely ally offering support to all three members of the marriage.

Based on a true story about a respected and seemingly happily married artist who discovers that he is a woman trapped in a man's body. The film starts off with some lighthearted sex games regarding cross-dressing and role reversal which appears to stimulate the loving couple. However, things take a shocking twist, when the husband begins to realize that his is a trans-gender person. The problem here is that in the long run, nothing but unhappiness and abuse becomes the couple. While the film wants to portray an heroic figure in the history of trans-gender people, I think it loses its appeal, as nothing but severe unhappiness result in this journey. Outside looking in, it might seem heroic, but for the people living it, their happiness becomes a tragic ending. With that said, great acting and an interesting historical journey makes this movie a must see."

This time around Eddie portrays a man who became a woman in the first sex change operation of the twentieth century. Redmayne (33) plays a boy who literally becomes a girl! ~~ to wit, a well known Danish artist of the era, male, who underwent genital surgery in the early 1900s to become a woman -- preceding the American transsexual celebrity of Christine Jorgenson by half a century. Given the sexual confusion now rampant in the so- called ""advanced"" Western Democracies this one is destined to become a gay cult classic if nothing else ... <br/><br/>The Plot centers in the disturbed marriage of Danish artist Gerda Wegener and her sexually confused husband Einar. In a painting of hers for which she has Einar posing in drag she portrays Him as a woman which arouses his suppressed feminine feelings to the point where he starts to cross dress and see himself as a woman -- a good looking one at that. The transformation is so intense that he renames himself Lili Elbe, from where the next inevitable step is sex change surgery -- putting his male life on the line as such an operation was seen as quite dangerous at the time.<br/><br/>Both Redmayne and his wife in the film, new face Alicia Vikander, 26, from Sweden, are superb. Classy pastel shaded photography provides perfect support for the period feeling. Exquisite sets and decor. The central subject aside from the obvious gender transformation is the search for self and marital fidelity in the face of an impossible marital situation. Vikander as a truly devoted wife stands by him and supports him all during his painful reassessment of self and final decision to go through with a dangerous operation to resolve his/her identity dilemma.

","Can a movie be impeccably made-well-cast and strongly acted, flawlessly appointed and gorgeously shot-yet still leave you cold? Can it do everything right technically without touching you emotionally? Can it offer a transporting experience without changing you one bit? Such is the conundrum with ""The Danish Girl.""<br/><br/>Given that he's telling the story of real-life artist Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne)-the first-known person to undergo sexual reassignment surgery nearly a century ago when he transformed himself into Lili Elbe-director Tom Hooper plays it dismayingly safe. As was the case with his Oscar-winning ""The King's Speech"" and ""Les Miserables,"" Hooper's latest is tasteful and restrained to a fault. It is easier to admire than love. And maybe that's intentional to some extent. Maybe-in adapting Lucinda Coxon's script, based on David Ebershoff's novel about the 1920s Danish landscape painter-Hooper aims to reach the widest possible audience by presenting such potentially challenging material in the form of a lush prestige picture.<br/><br/>Maybe the thinking is that the vast majority of people would be more likely to see a movie about a transgender character if it were offered as awards bait, to use a phrase that's pejorative but apt, rather than a scrappy little indie like ""Tangerine."" Between both of these movies-and the award-winning television series 'Transparent,"" and the well-documented saga of Caitlyn Jenner-the struggles transgender people have endured have been part of the consciousness and dialogue this past year like never before. ""The Danish Girl"" may seem zeitgeisty through sheer timing-and that may seem cynical on the surface-but it's clear that its heart is in the right place.<br/><br/>But speaking of the heart, ""The Danish Girl"" is more likely to appeal to the head. Admittedly, there's some striking imagery that will surely grab you: tutus hanging backstage at the ballet, illuminated from below like tulle jellyfish, or the crisp symmetry of immaculate, identical row houses, shot in widescreen. During a rare daring moment, Einar visits a peep show to mimic the stripper's moves, and the two end up in a spontaneous sort of dance through the glass. But there are also plenty of images that are rather obvious and simplistic in their symbolism: a sheer sheet hanging between Einar and his wife Gerda (Alicia Viklander) at bedtime, providing a physical separation, or a scarf blowing away in the wind as Alexandre Desplat's score soars with it.<br/><br/>The excellent ""Tangerine,"" by contrast, may seem like a daunting prospect: Sean Baker's film, about a pair of trash-talking transgender prostitutes tearing through the streets of Hollywood on Christmas Eve, stars first-time actresses and was shot entirely on an iPhone. But it actually ends up being the more accessible of the two films; it's got an immediacy and a vibrancy that ""The Danish Girl"" sorely lacks, as well as a genuine sense of emotional connection.<br/><br/>This is no fault of the film's stars, Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander, who both give deeply committed performances-although one is stronger than the other. Redmayne has proven himself a technical master of transformation; his precise performance as Stephen Hawking in last year's ""The Theory of Everything"" understandably earned him an Academy Award for best actor. Once again, he's playing a real-life figure who undergoes a physical change that puts a strain on his marriage and forces both partners to reexamine their fractured bond, even as it's clear that they still love each other.<br/><br/>Hooper, working with his usual cinematographer, Danny Cohen, luxuriates in Redmayne's androgyny as Einar steadily morphs into Lili. (Those cheekbones! Those lips! Those long, elegant limbs!) And Paco Delgado's Jazz Age costume design is just decadent-not only for Redmayne but for the cast as a whole. But the film regards this complex figure in a way that's mostly superficial. We never truly understand what drives Einar to become Lili completely, despite the physical danger and the social stigma; the character becomes a collection of mannerisms and proclamations. Certainly she was brave, but grasping the source and depth of that bravery would have made her feel like a fully fleshed-out person worthy of more than just polite appreciation.<br/><br/>The story that's truly intriguing is the one that belongs to Vikander as Einar's wife, Gerda-a fellow painter who struggled to be taken seriously in her husband's shadow until she asks Einar to sit for a portrait of a ballerina and gets her first glimpse of his feminine side. Although Einar is the one who changes physically, Gerda is the one with the more compelling emotional arc. She's in the tricky spot of having to be the rock but also evolve with an ever-changing situation, and doing so gives her more opportunities for shading.<br/><br/>At first, she's accepting of Einar wearing lingerie under his suits and even a little turned on by it; playing dress-up at home eventually inspires them to enjoy lavish evenings among their friends in Copenhagen, just a couple of girls out on the town. But as it becomes increasingly clear that ""Lili"" isn't just a persona but rather an expression of Einar's true self, Gerda has to grapple with the fact that everything she's known to be safe and true is crumbling beneath her.<br/><br/>At the same time, her career as a portrait artist is finally flourishing-with the blossoming Lili as her muse. And as friends new (Ben Whishaw) and old (Matthias Schoenaerts) enter the equation to lend support in various forms, they muddle matters further.<br/><br/>Vikander, who's been on such a roll this year already in two extremely different films-the exquisite ""Ex Machina"" and the glossy romp ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E.""-makes every moment of her character's journey believable with great nuance, from her strength and optimism to her confusion and loneliness. There's a lovely delicacy to her but also a directness that's equally appealing.<br/><br/>The title refers to Redmayne's character and the transformation he underwent to make his outsides match his insides (to borrow a line from another recent beautiful but chilly domestic drama, Angelina Jolie Pitt's ""By the Sea""). But Vikander may actually be the film's true star."

","Einar (Eddie Redmayne) is a sensitive, hopeful, submissive painter that lives the unconvential bohemian lifestyle with his wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander). We recognize immediately in the first scenes of the movie the personalities of each protagonist and how they complement. Gerda, the choleric, flirtatious, domineering, fickle wife is struggling to make an impact in the painting scene of 1920s Denmark. They are both creative and free in an atmosphere where emotions are clearly a critical aspect of their work; Einar starts to question his own identity when he participates in cross-dressing modeling and recognizes new sensations that excite him profusely.<br/><br/>In the initial stages of his transformation the viewer might intuit that this is simply one of the whims of the bohemian lifestyle, but as Einar starts to discover his emotions and identity the viewer starts to understand the complexity of his situation. It is not simply what demeanor, expressions, persona, image Einar decides to show to world, but his issue becomes multi-faceted as he decides to understand at a deeper level what he wants from life, how he wants to exist.<br/><br/>Einar's entire transformation puts Gerda's love and acceptance to the test. It is as if her frolicking nature got a bittersweet turn of events and Gerda had to endure the turbulent process that Lili decided to undergo. It is an interesting turn of narrative where Hans starts to become interested in Gerda, having been his first experience where Einar explores the sexual and emotional affection of men, but I believe the story would have turned too gloomy and depressive for the viewer if we would not get a reward for all the sacrifice that Gerda had to make after following and accompanying Einar in transitioning to Lili. The movie succeeds in carrying an elaborate plot and finding a resolution that would display the importance of identity in the complex self-discovery of sexuality and image. It also poses difficult questions for the viewer in relation to the boundaries of acceptance, unconditional love, identity, and sexuality."

You could feel Gerda's pain that she wanted to understand and to help but sometimes she just didn't understand or know how to. You can also throughout the movie tell how Lile struggles deeply with coming to terms on how she really feels inside, and how she's always felt inside but she has to surpress it and act like it never happened.<br/><br/>I overall definitely enjoyed the movie and I think Alicia Vikander's and Eddie Redmayne's performances were spectacular and I have absolutely no complaints. It was just magical how they brought these two people to life again. There is one complaint though that I could not shake and unfortunately disappointed me towards the end of the movie: Gerda and Lile should have stayed together. Not only would that be most accurate to the real story but also the most accurate to the transgender experience. When someone undergoes gender-conforming surgery they're not becoming ""a new person"" they are simply matching the outside to what has always been there inside of them. Therefore it makes no sense that they didn't stay in love, because Lile was always the same, she was always she. With them breaking up and pursuing their own love lives it's almost as Einar transformed into Lile and became a new person which is with a doubt just inaccurate and wrong. In the real story Lile and Gerda stayed together after Lile found herself and therefore it would of course make the most sense that they should do the same in the movie.<br/><br/>I really liked the movie otherwise and I would without a doubt recommend it to other people."

"SkyPowers","8","0","2","12 September 2019"," The Best Film on Subject of Transgender Since ""Boys Don't Cry""
","Well I finally saw it on cable, September 2019. When ""Boys Don' Cry"" was released in 1999, the film that exploded Hilary Swank's career, the word transgender and the subject matter was relatively new to the general public. ""The Danish Girl"" is a period piece which takes place in France at a time when it was so novel that most most doctors viewed it as a mental illness caused by an imbalance of hormones, often diagnosed as schizophrenia or insanity. Sure there have been many films that take the subject of crossdressing as farce and comedy, dating back to ""Some Like it Hot"". 'The Danish Girl"" blew me away with it's sophisticated take on the subject and it is indeed painful to watch as we empathize with the tortured artist as he agonizingly accepts his true desire to be a woman after his wife playfully crossdresses him for a costume party which opens the floodgates to his self-realization he is a woman trapped in a man's body who goes by the name of Lili -- who does, admittedly, passes as a convincing cute lady. Equally painful is the agony his artist wife goes through during his mental and physical transformation. She loves her husband and he loves her, but as the plot progresses, physical intimacy between them slowly wanes. It is a tragic love story, often embarrassing, often erotic. I likely would have squirmed in my seat had I seen it in a theater audience. Though the artistry of this film and brilliant performances of the leads make this a must-see."
"ElMaruecan82","7","0","2","24 August 2019"," Lili's legacy deserved better than Redmayne's Oscar-baity pathos...
","In a heartfelt interview related to his role in ""Tootsie"", Dustin Hoffman recalled that existential epiphany when he was trying for different ways to look convincing as a woman, he realized that the issue wasn't about how realistic he looked but how beautiful. He then realized how demanding was society toward women and he cried at the thought of many interesting women he missed just because he himself applied that pressure on them. The role allowed him to approach the beauty-burden of women and in that fragment of interview lays one truth that the whole ""The Danish Girl"" movie flirts with but never embraces.<br/><br/>I know Tom Hooper's film isn't about cross-dressing as much as it's about gender-identity so I'm not comparing the film to ""Tootsie"". However, there comes a moment when the pre-surgery Lili Elbe, played by Eddie Redmayne, enjoys the idea of being believable as a woman and does the best to hide whatever can betray the male assets and deep inside, I couldn't help but feel as though I was watching an actor giving his best shot as a woman, because the initial idea of a woman was to be beautiful, to look sweet and sensitive, to let an innocent chuckle, a few sobbing breaths slip, and Redmayne looked believable in these clichÃ©s situations, but that was all.<br/><br/>In a film where you have the wife Gerta, an independent painter and strong female character played by Alicia Vikander, it's rather frustrating to see that a transgender person, once she becomes a woman, abandons all her dreams and makes her best to fit in a female crowd, talking about the last fashion of Paris and giggling like a schoolgirl. In ""Tootsie"", being the beautiful woman was the means, in ""The Danish Girl"", it's the end. When Lili becomes a woman, I'm sorry if this comparison offends but I immediately thought of Mr. Garrison in ""South Park"" who, as soon as he became a woman, enjoyed talking with girls about girly things such as men and the 'curse', it was like joining a club. I know the film goes deeper than that and the real-life story of Lilu is an inspiration for many people who feel trapped in the wrong body, however, I'm blaming the treatment for making the gender identity something as superficial and predictable.<br/><br/>For some reason, the film was more effective when it started like a game and Edgar started enjoying the way his modelling inspired a believable lady, having that same Tootsie ""epiphany"", when the struggle to search his identity was within the framework of art, the film could deliver its message without being too forceful, and art was the perfect medium. Think about it, what is the purpose of art, it seeks beauty, goodness and truth, a certain truth as perceived by the artist. Lili starts as ""beauty"" and then she reveals what Lili feels like the best part of herself and then at the end, it turns out that Lili was the truth, the one she's been longing for, she's his, no, her reality. ""The Danish Girl"" starts as a wonderful movie about art and the way it can speak some deep truths about our own personas, only this time, the work of art serves the model's epiphany... it's the idea of being looked at as someone, and then be treated like that someone, and then become that someone, it's a fantastic journey between the realms of reality and art, highlighting the latter's universal language.<br/><br/>Tom Hooper had a fantastic material in the original novel written by David Ebershoff, but for some reason, he decided it to turn it into a sober and melancholic drama whose second act is obviously tailor-made to shine a light on an important issue, in other words, it played the Oscar bait thing with the dragging sequences and the sad piano theme. I enjoyed ""The King's Speech"" not because of the stuttering performance or because of its climax (it was only a speech after all) but because it told a terrific friendship story, one can argue that ""The Danish Girl"" is also a tale of love between a woman and her husband who becomes a woman, but Redmayne plays a frustratingly passive character whose efforts to be a woman are only highlighted through sad monologues, cries and sorry for the term, cross-dressing and impressions that are so artificial that they never show what it is to feel like a woman, only to look like one.<br/><br/>Redmayne is a good actor but he pushes the pathos button way too far to make for an enjoyable experience and I'm not sure people who belongs to the community like to be their lives seen as eternal reservoirs of sadness. Vikander pulls off a terrific performance but she's clearly the leading character and while the producers put her in the supporting character to win, we're forced to enjoy Redmayne's continual pathos, regretting these true-to-life moments where even when she looked like a man was playfully posing like a woman. The second act is just the typical biopic material chronicling the final years of Lili and although her life is an inspiration, I wished it inspired more than a fade and pale drama from a director who seems to love playing on the safe side. Lili's legacy deserved better than Redmayne's performance."
"Saiyan_Prince_Vegeta","Null","0","1","23 August 2019"," Great acting, clothes and setting. They somehow managed to make it weird but bearable to watch,but still wouldn't rewatch. Shows new perspective on differences between genders
","First of all this movie is very loosely based on a real story, but it's still good.<br/><br/>ACTING:
The acting is great. I didn't see much with Eddie Redmayne and after hearing about this movie he looked kind of feminine to me, but it probably shows what a good actor he is. And actually he is a normal guy.<br/><br/>TRANSGENDER TOPIC:
I feel VERY uncomfortable around transgender people in real life, because I can't look at people who don't look as neither a man nor a woman, so I thought that I won't be able to watch this movie, but somehow the director managed to make it kind of neutral and comfortable enough to watch... Of course everything is beautifully exaggerated.<br/><br/>GENDER DIFFERENCES AND RELATIONSHIPS:
It interestingly shows the difference between genders. Firstly, when his wife said that girls are used that men look at them, but a man will feel uncomfortable if a woman will look him in the eyes. Secondly, it's interesting that women get a lot of attention. Thirdly, it's interesting how dominant or persistent some guys are. But you need know the line.
I liked Hans. He is a man who is a gentleman and just lives his life, he is a good guy, but he is manly and simply attracts girls. Nice. +1 star for this.
(Lesson for life): Don't forget that even though girls get a lot of attention from guys - their choice is limited. Let's say a girl gets attention from 10 guys. But the thing is that guy's choice is unlimited. You can just talk and invite to a date any girl you like or just if you notice any girl at the store that you like - you can talk for a minute and get her number. So it's actually much easier for guys to find a perfect girl for them.<br/><br/>SETTING:
I loved the setting and the clothing. Everyone was so stylish.<br/><br/>DISAGREEMENTS:
I think that the feelings of Gerda (his wife) were too suppressed. I'm sorry, but how did she remain so calm? Seeing the most important person in her life slowly disappear and deny her. Yes, she cried, but she would have to be in depression, when she cried in the movie I would cry 10 times more.<br/><br/>WHO SHOULD WATCH IT:
I think the audience of this movie should mostly be girls to stop them from doing some with their guys because it can start waking up some weird fantasies. And that's exactly why I can't say I recommend it to guys to watch it because it might look to them that being like that is ok. And it's just weird anyways."

"s_iliya_p","9","0","2","31 March 2019"," Why didn't this movie get the attention it deserves?
","Let's get to it confidently and frankly. We're in the age of political correctness, and many people find it difficult to adjust to new terms. This movie was released 4 years before the sensitivity of today's political correctness. I could only say that this movie was released a few years too soon.<br/><br/>Having said that, about the story itself, it goes back to 1926. Just try and imagine how was the public approach to this sensitive topic back then. So, before continuing reading this, this movie is about a very delicate topic and inspired by a true story. The first transgender goes through with a complex surgery of gender transformation. So, if this is not something you are comfortable with, do not watch this movie. Or, have a very open view about it.<br/><br/>Warning: It's really hard to talk about this movie without mentioning ""spoiling"" scenes. So please, try and don't read what's *between stars*. And if you're the type of person who enjoys reading a complete review before watching a movie ignore the said warning.<br/><br/>To me, this is a brilliant movie, and I can see that it might not be a popular one. Everything in this movie is a part of the story, and what is a movie but an audiovisual story? From the first scene, one can realize multiple introducing elements about ""Einar"" and ""Gerda"".
Einar is the masterful observant painter, and quite a perfectionist, one might even say obsessive. Einar and Gerda are not just in love or just husband and wife; they're best friends. Einar's fondness of women's fabrique is easily shown in ""his"" touches and gasps that comes with them. *Notice the way Einar's face changes when sensing the texture that reminds ""him"" of her true self*. Einar's perfectionism depicted in many scenes, *painting a landscape over and over to find the right color for the snow, or fixing Gerda's lipstick*, might in fact be the reason that leads her to be as courageous, intrepid and hopeful towards one of the hardest struggles of her life; find herself. Eddie Redmayne has done a perfect job bringing both Einar and Lili to life, to the point that you may get confused as if Eddie went through with this just as her character did. And you may wonder, why didn't he win the Oscar? You can know all about that, asking for a Mr. Leonardo Di Caprio's The Revenant.<br/><br/>Gerda is the boss, she's in control both in work and personal relationships. She has a dominant presence and controls her surroundings. Well-deserved Oscar winner Alicia Vikander shows a magnificent talent to realize Gerda. Gerda is in love, and she's in control. *Yet, her dilemma begins when she sees Lili kissing Hans. That's when she understands this has gone too far; she has lost control*.
*My appreciation for the heartbreak Lili has when she realizes Hans knows the ""real"" person in women's disguise, and he likes Einar and not her is very difficult for me to describe. What is emphasized also later that Hans is a homosexual*. Here is the only reason I deducted a point from the perfection; there could have been more discussions about sexuality in this movie. I figured the topic is complicated enough that Hooper, the director, may have intentionally dismissed it.
Costume design and set decorations are incredible in this movie, displaying Copenhagen, Paris, and Dresden, railway stations and hospitals are meticulously perfected. If it hadn't been for the academy's great deal of appreciation for Mad Max: Fury Road, The Danish Girl could have won these two recognitions as well.<br/><br/>Acting in this movie is fantastic. Landscapes, and most of the dialogues too. *Goosebumps, even behind my neck, when Lili asks for a night dress, rejected by ""Lili never stays the night"", responding ""doesn't matter what I wear, when I dream, it's Lily's dreams"" *; this is probably my favorite scene.<br/><br/>This is a very important story to be told, and Hooper did a good job doing it. if, as some critiques wrote, this movie was such a mainstream one, the ratings would be at least as good as action movies. Clearly, there is many biased opinions about this movie, just as there is a lot of hatred towards the transgender community. Remember what's said: ""haters gonna hate""."

","The Danish Girl is actually an okay film and giving it a five is probably a bit unfair. However, while it does manage to feel like a good film on the outside, inside its just a bland and emotionless disappointment. By this, I mean that the acting performances are very overrated. Eddie Redmayne does a great job as playing the transgender. However, he does not manage to add anything to the character that actually makes the story interesting. Alecia Vikander is okay, but her character isnt exactly interesting as her entire narrative revolves around Redmayne. She has very little development. Her performance is defnitealy not worthy of a supporting oscar, partly because she isnt very captivating and partly because she is a lead character. In general, Danish Girl is not a very interesting film to watch and will leave you feeling nothing at the end of the film other than the relief that it has ended. 5/10"

It is portrayed by beautiful and amazing actors, the art and sceneries in the movie is unspeakable.

","Complicity, the purest complicity is the league that leads people to reveal themselves to each other, to influence each other deeply, to deepen their desires in common, and to construct their particular joint scenes. Couples can achieve levels of companionship and mutual admiration that lead them to love each other intensely and truly. Love, not passion. Friendly affection, careful, dedicated, the will to support the other and be the basis for the other achievements. The Danish painters Einar and Gerda Wegener, who lived in Europe in the early twentieth century, have achieved this love. They became extremely accomplices. He wanted to reach a point never attempted by humans and that emerged as a possibility in his day, she took his desire to the point of being not only her own but an artistic attempt of both.
In ""The Danish Girl"" we are presented to a passionate, friend couple, who makes their shared life in a succession of moments of pleasure, experimentation, romance, joy, ardent passion, mutual professional and artistic support. Both painters, Einar already relatively successful as an artist, while Gerda seeks to achieve recognition similar to that of her husband. They met very young, when students of the ""Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts"" in Copenhagen, Denmark. They married in 1904, he 22 and she 19 years old. Made for each other, a man who by that time had already idealized being a woman and who was becoming madly horny in this desire and a lesbian.
With a memorable interpretation of Eddie Redmayne (Einar) and also magnificent acting by Alicia Vikander (Gerda), the film drives the spectators to feel all the pain suffered by both in the process of decision of the painter trying to get the sensation of being a woman; and go through surgeries to amputate his genitalia and artificially construct a feminine sexual organ mimesis. It was something like the couple had come together to give life to a work of art. A few years before Einar and Gerda tried to create Lili, Oscar Wilde wisely stated: ""Life imitates art much more than art imitates life"".
As exciting and extremely rewarding as the acting of the main actors is the photography of the film. Director of photography Danny Cohen has done something phenomenal, something really rare and that strikes us, the scenes seem to be built of pictures, paintings that succeed each other. They truly fill our eyes and challenge us to find one among them that does not resemble a beautiful picture and convey the emotions contained within. Nothing more appropriate for a narrative about part of the life of the painters. Cohen also performed in the same role in other feature films, highlighting ""The King's Speech"" and ""Les MisÃ©rables"", but it was with ""The Danish Girl"" that he reached the level of splendor.
Tom Hooper did an exceptional job, also directed the two famous films mentioned above, but it is with the story of Einar and Gerda that he manages to make us deeply identify with the sadness and the disturbance of the Wegener couple. Since watching ""The Danish Girl,"" I wonder how Hooper would film the story of a person with Bodily Identity Identity Disorder."

","Directed by Tom Hooper, ""The Danish Girl"" is based on the 2000 novel with the same name written by David Ebershoff. The story is loosely based on the life of Einar Wegener, the first person to go through transgender surgery, and his personal struggles and relationship with his wife. In ""The Danish Girl,"" performances are as important as the story itself. From the first scene I fell in love with Eddie Redmayne's acting and later paid more attention to Alicia Vikander, as Gerda Wegener, and her outstanding performance. Einar is going through a transformation progress to become Lili, and the perception of Gerda's infinite and everlasting love for her husband is the strongest point of the film. This performance brought Alicia Vikander an Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role. On the other hand, Eddie Redmayne's performance was critical for the film's reputation. He is becoming the master in disguise after his equally hard role as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. That performance brought him an Oscar for The Best Performance by Actor in a Leading Role. One year later he came very close to win his 2nd Oscar for his performance in ""The Danish Girl."" The role of Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe is very hard to perform. Figures, gestures, mimics and feelings are very important. To master this particular role, you need to feel like Einar Wegener, and Redmayne's performance overcomes all the struggles of this role. With this kind of hard roles, you get to see the real talent of the artist.<br/><br/>Controversial or sensitive subjects have always been rewarded in cinema. It is thought by the authorities that this kind of films always serve to the true purpose of art. I don't share this thought, but yet again I am not the one in power to decide what is good and bad for the audience. Films like ""The Danish Girl"" have a mission to show us the unspoken or hidden facts. Most of the time getting into these roles is not easy, and this is the reason why they are usually awarded.<br/><br/>Camera shots behind the ballet clothes and paintings manage to make a difference in the means of Cinematography. Beautiful sceneries and identical Danish houses were shot with wide angles, and this technique shows us the importance of cinematography for a film. In ""The Danish Girl,"" both Einar and his wife Gerda are painters. So, default setup of the scenes, with paintings and costumes all over, are preparing you for the grey mood presented throughout the film. Beautiful and diverse costumes also serve the purpose of the film. This brought another nomination to ""The Danish Girl"" for Best Achievement in Costume Design. The clothes Einar wear in disguise as a woman are matching both the era and the inner taste of Lili. Those costumes are somehow the visual representatives of her inner feelings as a woman.<br/><br/>The perception of homosexuality back in 20s in Europe is another subject of the film. Tom Hooper focuses on all the struggles of Einar by showing some scenes that take courage to show. He goes to striptease shows and imitates the dancing woman. He goes to fish market to observe the gestures of women. He continuously imagines himself as a woman and getting beaten up once.<br/><br/>Lili and Einar are two different characters. One of them is Einar's true form, and the other is the person he is forced to be. Social pressure tends to force you into personalities that don't represent you. If a person doesn't have strong state of mind, this forcing may end up in suicide. This is not the case for Einar. He is a strong character, and he knows that he is a woman inside. This is how he faces all the bumps on the road. Transgender surgeries are a matter of debate even today. In long term, this kind of films are going to build up the social acceptance. This is how cinema serves to society.<br/><br/>With outstanding performances and an interesting subject, ""The Danish Girl"" encourages people with the similar situation to act and live their lives as they see fit. Being drama, history and biography, ""The Danish Girl"" is one of the good examples of these genres."
"blumdeluxe","7","0","1","17 May 2018"," Weird display of transsexuality
","""The Danish Girl"" tells the story of the first woman ever to experience the change into her body through operational measures. It shows how a Danish painter and husband recalls long-hidden feelings and finds the strength to stand up for his wish to get a female body, including all that means for his relationship and his beloved ones.<br/><br/>First of all it is great that this movie evoked awareness for the feelings of transsexuals and I think that the given biography is more than worth being displayed on the screen. However, I didn't really get warm with this film and this is mainly because I find the display of Lily's transsexuality rather odd. The way it is displayed is really a bit schizophrenic, which transsexuality is clearly not. But I can't imagine any transsexual completely neglecting events or losing certain capabilities like the capability to draw just because they currently switched their gender, which is by the way also not how this works, because transsexuality doesn't transfer you into another person, it just adjusts your body to the person you are. This way, I found it rather hard to follow the film because it seems to be based on a difficult understanding of how transsexuality works, even though the actors delivergreat performances and the overall production value of the film is worthy without question. <br/><br/>All in all I would have wished for less Hollywood scripted emotions and more real ones, a more sinister approach to how transsexuals, to make this film as great as its intentions."

","If you don't know the plot and even don't intend to then this review is for you. This movie shows how beautifully the love can be represented. I just want to say the one word for this movie and that is ""AWESOME"". I watched this movie at 3 am and my eyes were crying to sleep but this movie just trapped me in its emotions which was the result of the flawless representation and natural acting of the superb actors.
Portrayal of real characters is as it must be(advice for the people who said that Eddie Redmayne did not do true judgement with the character) and what to say about Alicia Vikandar, I was internally in love with her while watching the movie. Her expressions and dialogue-delivery just revive the real Gerda Wegenar.
Shooting locations are so impressive. It is a beautiful movie. It also contain some nude scenes but there is no sex. Those scenes are the demand of the depiction of the story. Some scene indirectly represents the feelings of Einar Wegener(Lead Male/Female(You will understand after watching the movie) character).Let us see you can feel them or not(I am hinting ""Creation of a painting so many times"").
If you are really interested in watching a master-piece emotional drama and did not have any hatred for non-straight persons then this movie is specially created to invest your precious time in it."

","Loosely based on a ""real"" story, the plot is about Einar Wegener/Lili, one of the first transgender people to undergo surgery. The story starts in 1926, with Einar happily married to Gerda. Both are painters, enjoying some fame in Copenhagen. One day Gerda asks Einer to wear silk stockings to pose for an unfinished portrait of a ballerina and from then on Einar starts discovering Lili, his ""female"" side, which will end up ""killing"" Einar.<br/><br/>Gerda pursues her career and finds success with Einar's portraits as his female counterpart Lili. The couple moves to Paris, where Einar can leave more openly as Lili in the bohemian artist society. Also, Gerda meets a former friend of Einar, the brooding and all-male Hans, who stirs feelings presumably more pleasant than dealing with your husband's trans-sexuality.<br/><br/>After several disastrous meetings with different doctors, all of whom think Einar is insane, a German surgeon finally announces he will try to help Einar getting rid of his male parts and start living fully as Lili. Gerda, supported by Hans, decides to stick to Lili's decision and stays with her ""husband"" during his medical treatment. However, surgery is a risky business, even more so a hundred years agoÂ…. <br/><br/>The movie created - predictably - some controversy. Some criticized the fictional character of Hans, but I think he provided a much needed masculine but discreet performance, to balance the Einar/Lili character. Vikander is really good in showing the strong mix of emotions Gerda felt during Einar's journey: from amusement to worry, from horror, desperation and rage and finally to support. <br/><br/>I did not like much Redmayne as Einar/Lili. Granted it was a difficult part to play, but Redmayne drove me to distraction with his hands movements and his fluttering of eyelashes. Besides, he was not even remotely believable as a woman, just a guy in wig and drags. I am surprised he did not ""attract"" more bewildered reactions, especially during the first outing at the big ball in Copenhagen. That anybody there mistook him for a girl is ludicrous.<br/><br/>Photography and costumes are very good, especially the choice of the cold, Nordic light and minimalist interiors. However, after the move to Paris, the story does slow down considerably and even more so after the first surgery, when I thought the movie should finish, but there was still a bit to go. A tighter editing and a different male lead would have helped."

","For a film dealing with subject matter completely out of my comfort zone, I thought director Hooper sensitively handled a complex topic intelligently in the manner of Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Moountain"" of 2005. The movie itself is beautifully filmed, and Eddie Redmayne's performance as the transgendered Einar/Lili comes close to his Oscar winning portrayal of Stephen Hawking in the prior year's ""The Theory Of Everything"". Alicia Vikander is also competent in the role of Einar's wife Gerda, resolutely standing by her spouse's decision to follow through on a sex change operation after initial misgivings about Einar's apparently sudden mental and physical transformation. Taking place in the late 1920's in Europe, I wasn't surprised at the reaction of the medical profession to what was going on with Einar, though I wouldn't have thought that experimental forms of gender reassignment surgery took place as early as 1930. To think that if Einar had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, he might have wound up in an institution for moral depravity undergoing treatment for perversion. In that regard, the film chronicles a valiant pioneering effort on the part of Einar/Lili for those individuals hopelessly conflicted over their own sexual identity."

","Inspired by a 1920s Danish artist with gender dysphoria who became one of the first to ever opt for surgical gender realignment, this Tom Hooper drama offers an intriguing insight into a fairly recent time when such terms were unheard of. The central character's dilemma is, as a result, twice as interesting as he not only has to wrestle with his own identity but a lack of support and understanding. Promising as this might sound, and relatively convincing as lead actor Eddie Redmayne is in drag, his character is always self-absorbed with a near total disregard for his wife's feelings that renders him hard to relate to. Alicia Vikander fares better as the neglected wife in the equation with a more dynamic character arc as she gradually learns to accept that she needs to ""lose"" her husband for him to be happy; looks convey more than words in a memorable moment as she is told ""he won't be your husband"" after surgery. In fact, a more enticing film could have been spun from concentrating more on her. Something also feels amiss in how Vikander dressing Remayne as a woman (for a pose) is the event that triggers everything. We are later given a couple of anecdotes about him having similar feelings in the past, but it mostly feels that dressing up started it all - not deep-rooted inner doubts. Of course, there is a limit to how much can be fitted into a two hour feature, and with sterling cinematography and great music, plus accurate costumes and sets, 'The Danish Girl' does a decent job, even if it sometimes feels like it is only skimming the surface here."

","This film tells the remarkable true story of an early attempt to effect a transgender choice from male to female involving pioneering, but dangerous, gender reassignment surgery.<br/><br/>The title is clever. Clearly it refers to Einar Wegener, the early 20th century male landscape painter, who wishes to become Lili Elbe not just through dress and mannerisms but as physically as possible. But the title can also be taken to reference his wife, the portrait artist Gerda Wegener who shows amazing understanding and support. So the headline performance is from British actor Eddie Redmayne as Einar/Lili who, following the Academy Award for his superb acting in ""A Theory Of Everything"", gives another convincing and nuanced representation of a real character. But this should not be allowed to overshadow the impressive acting of the Swedish Alicia Vikander who continues to shine ever more brightly since her break-out English-speaking role in ""Ex Machina"".<br/><br/>The British director of the work is Tom Hooper who consolidates his success following ""Les MisÃ©rables"" and ""The King's Speech"".

The story of a Danish painter who is married to a lovely woman painter and poses for her one day so she can finish a painting about a ballerina. The ballerina being unavailable, she asks her husband to dress as a woman. What the husband experiences is indescribable unless you have had some transvestite interests, but the point is that what he feels right there is life changing. For him, being dressed as a woman is what he loves, and he feels that he is a woman trapped in a man's body. A woman that he will call Lily.

The period design looked really nice and had some very good landscaping shots, almost as if it's like the landscapes Einar Wagner paints. The costumes are great with making Eddie Redmayne actually look like a convincing woman. But the story falls a bit flat when it brings up the issues that it's about. The first transgender reassignment operation. The film doesn't portray the transgender-ism as what it is. Someone who thinks or knows they were born the wrong gender and that want to change that. The film represents transgender-ism as a split personality disorder with Einar Wagner constantly referring to Lili Elbe (his female personality) as a completely different person. The film also has a very slow pace which doesn't work for character building or plot movement.

Alicia Vikander co-stars as Einar/Lili's conflicted but supporting wife Gerda Wegener. Alicia hit her wonderland earlier this year when she won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance here. And Vikander's work was the highlight of the movie. What needs to be transformed a bit was Hooper's lackadaisical direction of the picture. Lucinda Coxon's screenplay was also not worth a danish doughnut.

This time around Eddie portrays a man who became a woman in the first sex change operation of the twentieth century. Redmayne (33) plays a boy who literally becomes a girl! ~~ to wit, a well known Danish artist of the era, male, who underwent genital surgery in the early 1900s to become a woman -- preceding the American transsexual celebrity of Christine Jorgenson by half a century. Given the sexual confusion now rampant in the so- called ""advanced"" Western Democracies this one is destined to become a gay cult classic if nothing else ... Plot centers in the disturbed marriage of Danish artist Gerda Wegener and her sexually confused husband Einar. In a painting which becomes very popular she portrays Einar as a woman which arouses his suppressed feminine feelings to the point where he starts to cross dress and see himself as a woman -- a good looking one at that. The transformation is so intense that he renames himself Lili Elbe, from where the next inevitable step is sex change surgery -- putting his male life on the line as such an operation was seen as quite dangerous at the time. Both Redmayne and his wife in the film, new face Alicia Vikander, 26, from Sweden, are superb. Classy pastel shaded photography provides perfect support for the period feeling. Exquisite sets and decor. The central subject aside from the obvious gender transformation is the search for self and marital fidelity in the face of an impossible marital situation. Vikander as a truly devoted wife stands by him and supports him all during his painful reassessment of self and final decision to go through with a dangerous operation to resolve his/her identity dilemma.

On one hand, he illustrates the burning desire to be his true self. Yet, a tinge of selfishness is implied from this; little is he depicted with sympathy for Gerda and consideration of her prospect.

"davidaimbd","8","0","1","26 May 2016"," Great plot; but redundant and minimal relationships
","If you are going to watch this film, don't gaze upon the 70% Rotten Tomato's score and think not highly of this film. It is a tear, and it is evident in the critic reviews, that there was a high level of division of whether the film was great or blandly minimal, redundant, and stereotypical toward the transgender community and gay men in general. I would have to pin my review somewhere in the middle. If you are or are in close contact with any LGBTQ person, you may find this film to stereotype certain members of that community. Eddie Redmayne did portray the character as a slightly feminine and characterized version of a gay man soon to be transgender, which makes his performance look a little bit lazy. In interviews, he did state that he talked to several transgender people and it seems that he just attempted to generalize what they all said into his own portrayal, which is understandable in some respects. But for me, the major upset was Alcia Vkandir. In the scenes that she was in, she was so elegant and persuasive, and human. She and Redmayne worked beautifully together. But, I wanted more drama between the two. I need that crying sensation that Vkandir can pull of so well. That didn't happen as glorified in the initial trailer. Further more, the relationships that occur toward the start of act two tend to become fuzzy and difficult to understand as the movie progresses. I was bored throughout the ending of act 2 and into act 3, due to redundancy and the extremely slow pacing of the story, that it had come to be. Overall, it needed to speed up, and it needed more attention to detail toward the later parts in the movie. However, there was some exceptional moments in this film, one's that began to bring the humanity of the situation into full view. Artsy is the word that some of the scenes portray. Such as the scene where ""Lilly"" is experimenting with the feelings of wanting to be a woman, by playing with his gentiles while looking in the mirror, to see what it would look like if he had a feminine vagina. In addition, when Vkandir's character comes home from the art gallery, and finds her husband still in the costume of a woman, what she thought he was doing, the emotion is real. Please be aware of the subject manner, and the brief nudity in about four scenes, and be sure that everyone you are watching with understands that the subject is heavy and could bring slight shock or misunderstanding. And if you are a member of the LGBTQ community, go into this movie with an open mind, and remind yourself that this is long ago, and the community has changed in the extremity since then. Try to find yourself in this film, and give yourself time to reflect after seeing it, for you will catch things that you never knew existed in the film. Enjoy!"

","Tom Hopper's follow-up of THE KING'S SPEECH (2010) and LES MISERABLES (2012) is a ""true"" story about Einar Wegner, aka. Lili Elbe (Redmayne), a Danish landscape painter in 1920s, who was among the first recipients of sex change surgery in the human history, and the film is all about the telling love story between him and his supporting wife Gerda (Vikander), a portrait artist, and how they mange to shoulder on during Einar/Lili's unconventional pursuit to become a real woman.<br/><br/>If you do some background checking, you will find the film is not nearly based on the real story of Einar and Gerda, indeed, most of the depiction is fictionalized in its source novel written by David Ebershoff. So it is rather shameful the movie has been painstakingly marketed with the ""based on a true story"" tag just because it looks more like an Oscar bait.<br/><br/>Also, tackling the thorny issue of trans-gender cognition, the film is told entirely through the point- of-view from a male perspective to define a woman (fancy dresses, makeups, a vagina, that is all ) and a tolerant and support wife, an imaginary elaboration from a cisgender mindset, which can be explored as a particular angle, but when the whole narrative pivots around it, the film will definitely not appear as politically correct.<br/><br/>Against all these hindrances, THE DANISH GIRL is a breathtakingly gorgeous achievement on all its technical levels, Desplat's magnificent score ushers audience into the splendor of its production design, costume, landscape, architecture and art pieces, on the eye level, the film is impeccably enticing. Then the performances of two leads, the ""it"" star in Hollywood now, Vikander won as Oscar for her ""supporting"" role, if one takes the word literally, she is indeed the most supporting character you can expect, except one brief moment of lapse when she seeks comfort from the hunky art dealer Hans Axgil (Schoenaerts). Her win really becomes a nuisance if we think of the exact same position of Felicity Jones in THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING (2014), her Jane Hawking is a ""leading"" role in her own life, instead of being a ""supporting"" wife for Stephen Hawking (Redmayne again), otherwise she could have given Patricia Arquette a good run for her money.<br/><br/>Although Redmayne's physiognomy is too angular to call it as an earthly beauty and there are certain cringe-worthy moments when he relentlessly tries to imitate the feminine mannerism in front of the mirror, it is self-consciously awkward and betrays Redmayne's self-effacing nature, but this is what the best one can get from allowing a male actor to play a trans-gender pioneer, something is congenitally missing at the first place<br/><br/>Anyway, THE DANISH GIRL effectuates its emotional punch when reaching its lugubrious finish line, albeit its inadequately adapted screenplay. Frankly speaking it is a winsome movie, but it is not a brave one, a lost opportunity to bring about something extraordinary (casting a real trans- actor in the leading role for instance) out of an inspiring and valuable true story."

I also wasn't sure that I wanted to see Eddie Redmayne in drag.<br/><br/>Again, I have nothing against men in drag, but it just isn't my thing.<br/><br/>As with Brooklyn, the film is beautifully made and I had already fallen in love with the brilliant and beautiful Alicia Vikander following her roles in Testament of Youth (a great film!) and Ex-Machina, (also pretty good).<br/><br/>It is Copenhagen in 1926, and Vikander plays Gerda an artist, the wife of Redmayne, who plays Einer, also an artist.<br/><br/>Einer believes he is a woman in a man's body and decides to change his appearance into a female and his name from Einar to Lili. Gerda continues to love and support Lili in his/her quest to become a female. Lili becomes the first person to ever undertake transgender surgery.<br/><br/>Redmayne was nominated for best actor for this role. Quite frankly, I couldn't see it. I couldn't totally see it last year when he won the Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking; but this time around, it seems that the luvvies of Hollywood have nominated him for the nature of the role, rather than the way he actually played it.<br/><br/>He was okay-ish but nothing special. I am sure that there are hundreds of actors out there who could have made a better fist of it – What's wrong with using one of those brilliant Scandinavian actors who all speak excellent English? They act their socks off in their 'Scandi noir' dramas. But Redmayne is the man of the moment and no doubt a draw for audiences.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot and sensitively directed, and for what it's worth, it does hold your attention, especially when Vikander is on the screen. It's an interesting story, and the setting of Copenhagen in the 1920's makes for some fascinating sets and cinematography.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that Swedish Alicia won the Oscar for supporting actress – the first of many I suspect.<br/><br/>The Danish Girl isn't for everyone; but if this is the kind of subject matter that appeals to you, you could do worse than give this well- made film the once over."

","Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) is a well received Danish painter in the early 20th century. His wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander) is less well received. Gerda uses Einar's feminine side Lili as the subject of her paintings. Gerda starts to gain recognition while Lili starts going out dressed up. It's a struggle for both partners. Eventually, Lili seeks a full sex reassignment surgery.<br/><br/>This is beautifully shot and Redmayne delivers a solid performance. Alicia Vikander is the acting power behind the throne. In the end, the movie lacks drama. Einar never faces insurmountable hurdles. Gerda is utterly supportive. There is limited tension. The plot doesn't have any surprises considering the subject matter. Also I never get the sense of Lili's point of view. It is so far from what most people experiences. More than any other subject, director Tom Hooper needs to put the audience into the shoes of the protagonist. The movie fails to do that. It's still beautiful and the two actors are terrific but it is very much like one of Einar's landscapes. It is expertly made but I don't really feel it."

Though, it remained simple and trivial, the landscapes and the atmosphere were great asset to his performance. The only conclusion that I can draw from it is that however hard you may try, the nature will extinguish all your endeavours to go against her. Einar attempted to change his life completely and his prayers had been answered, but when you decide to cross the nature, it might award you for a brief period of time, however, it is resolved to punish those whom it considers being turned against her."

I know, I know, the eighth deadly sin but it happened alright? The whole plot was there. They didn't really leave anything to one's imagination. But I thought; hey, maybe I'm wrong and this movie have a lot to give. Wrong. It told the same story as the trailer, they just managed to take up two more hours doing so. Yes, that says more about the trailer than the film itself but hold up, I'm not done yet...<br/><br/>Not only does this film have a bad trailer, this whole film FEELS like a trailer. Even though it's too long for it's own good it doesn't manage to go in-depth of anything. It all feels rather shallow and slow and has a lot of pieces missing (as though a trailer creating cliffhangers). <br/><br/>But to be honest, I did give this film 7/10 so there's got to be something good about this and there absolutely is. Almost all of the acting is splendid. Being Swedish I have to honour Alicia Vikander a bit extra. She truly gives her character depth and I couldn't help but to feel for the struggles she went through. Redmayne is one of my favourites but he's not quite on Vikanders level.<br/><br/>The Danish Girl is worth watching, not because it's a great movie, but more because of historical value."

It's about the struggle of Eniar when he tries to embrace and find his true sexual identity while his wife, Gerda tries to help and preserve their marriage. <br/><br/>Personally I think the supporting lead, Alicia Vikander(Gerda) who got an Oscar for it, carries the whole movie. I've found Eddie Redmayne (Lili) dull and simply plain. He could've make us feel the struggles of finding the sexuality in a more effective way considering it wasn't 21st century, it was 1920's. It was not common or normal. He seemed to be in Lili rather than Einar too like he never lived as Einar in his life.But the story is inspired by the true people, and their story is actually what the movie tells us. Costumes, hair and make up and production is on point. But I just think Eddie and the screenplay is a bit dull, it could've written in a more emotional way. They could've make something amazing with the story they had, but it ended up as a okay drama movie with a great pilot."
"clanciai","9","0","1","4 March 2016"," Anatomy of transgenderism at its first venturesome and failed efforts - Was it worth it?
","First of all, it's a beautiful picture all the way with amazing wonder of pictorial qualified aestheticism which is sustained throughout, masking the very debatable and to some disgusting plot in merciful and seducing perfume. Especially the music by Alexandre Desplat works miracles about this - he always seems to do that and has elevated the quality of many films that way, especially art films. This is above all an art film and should not be ignored as such. After six years of marriage an artist finds himself in a typical artist's crisis and finds a peculiar way out of it - by transcending into a woman. Eddie Redmayne does not make a bad job of it but actually makes a more impressing performance than the Oscar-winner in what must be recognized as one of the most difficult and sensitive performances imaginable. It's actually difficult to think that anyone would willingly venture into such a minefield.<br/><br/>And does the transgender operation solve his problem? Of course not, and that's the disappointing conclusion of the film. Anyone should have known that from the start, and especially the artist. I have met many transgender people in my days, and not one was convincing - the old sex shone garishly through in every case. I am not saying that it must fail, but violating nature is never a good idea.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it remains a very beautiful film, for the music and the scenery and couldn't have been made better. Enhjoy it for its beauty, and pardon the tragedy for its foolishness, – but, as so often in films, without that there would have been no story to be told."

","I was expecting greatness, I must admit, and that's too much of a burden for most films. Director, source material, actors, designer, all looked like a great fit, so I settled down for a great night of cinema, and for the first twenty minutes or so thought I might get it. Every shot seemed like a Dutch painting, which I'm sure were the inspirations, but none of it felt real. And let's be honest a lot of filmmakers base the look on paintings, but you then need to make it breathe and live. This didn't, it just continued to look like nicely composed paintings. But Alicia Vikander was a joy right from the beginning, bringing depth, clarity and humanity to the role.<br/><br/>Unlike Eddie Redmayne who proceeded to play one note for the whole film. He seemed to have decided that if he looks down and then up again through his eyelids he was now a woman. It was a performance of tricks, and lazy tricks really, which were skin deep at best, which is ironic since the whole point of his character is about finding what's beneath the skin. I like some of his performances but I think with this he bit off more than he can chew and the director was not skilled enough to get the performance he needed out of Redmayne. <br/><br/>It's a huge shame as it is a very interesting story; the true one that is. The real story spanned 20 years and when you look at the time-frame of what really happened it all makes much more sense. The film feels rushed, and yet at the same time painfully slow at times, and it just doesn't work trying to squeeze 20 years of story into a couple. <br/><br/>A lot of noise about nothing, is my verdict."

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.1/5 stars<br/><br/>""The Danish Girl"" explores a pertinent topic that's seldom told in mainstream cinema. Hopefully, with Oscar winners Tom Hooper and Eddie Redmayne attached to the subject this time, along with upcoming starlet Alicia Vikander, the subject of transsexuality will get, at the very least, a small short in the arm. The film revolves around the love story inspired by the lives of artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. It follows the evolution of their work and marriage as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a pioneering transsexual.<br/><br/>Though the film hinges firmly on Redmayne's transformative and heartfelt performance, it's helped considerably by Vikander's strong portrayal of his understanding, cognitive wife Gerda – torn between the desire to keep her husband and the support she lends to help him take an unprecedented, life-changing, step – and a lovely turn by Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts as Redmayne's old friend. If Redmayne is totally convincing as both Einar and the film's eponymous character – providing another sterling example of how deeply he can immerse himself in a role – then, Vikander delves deep beneath the surface to explore a truly fascinating woman.<br/><br/>Still, you wish that the film had dwelled into the strange relationship that developed between Gerda and Lili's transsexuality (Einar's alter-ego after embracing his true gender) as they endeavored to comprehend it together. Instead, Hooper and his writer Coxon choose to stay on a safe path and dwell mostly into sentimental territory, which detracts somewhat from the film's topical nature pertaining to history's first recorded transsexual. Nevertheless, ""The Danish Girl's"" unique and brave story, and the two delicate central performances give it a gripping emotional weight that is quite affecting."

On the one hand, I did not like one of the Danish gals one bit and could not care a jot about his/her gender struggles. Eddie Redmayne's Einar Wegener is quite the most egocentric, demanding and selfish person whose disregard for the true affection of his partner has a truly chilling effect on both the film and the viewer. Visually, the project is gorgeous and lyrical and the costuming simply brilliant. Redmayne, too, offers a strained, stylized performance that persuades me of his determination to get what he/she wants. It is Vikander, however, who holds the heart of the film firmly in her grasp and without whom the story would probably collapse. This is a love story, alright, Gerda's with Einar and Einar's with both his selves."

","THE DANISH GIRL is a beautifully made, artistically directed motion picture with 2 very strong lead performers telling an important story of a pioneer in the Transgender community. Unfortunately, it only had about 1 hour and 20 minutes worth of material to cover in it's 1 hour and 57 minute length.<br/><br/>To make up for it's lack of story, director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech) relies on very pretty, almost portrait-like pictures in depicting the story of married artists Einer Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) and Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander) as they deal with the growing realization that Einer is living a lie as a man and really needs to be living the life of his female alter-ego, Lili. Therefore, the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of this film really drag - but, boy, is that middle hour really, really good.<br/><br/>Starting with the acting Redmayne is perfectly cast as Einer/Lili. His portrayal starts as a male with a female inside that you watch metamorph into the full-blown female that she is. Redmayne is delicate and strong, sure and unsure, male and female throughout the film but never loses the inner beauty and inner strength of his character. He is nominated for a BEST ACTOR Oscar (an award he won last year for playing Stephen Hawking in THEORY OF EVERYTHING) and has followed that up with another strong, nuanced performance.<br/><br/>But, to me, this movie belonged to Alicia Vikander as his wife, Gerda. At first, encouraging Einer to dress in women's clothes, as her muse, Gerda realizes that she is losing her husband to another woman - but that woman IS her husband and the anger, frustration, confusion and LOVE she has for this person is vividly seen. She is nominated for Best SUPPORTING Actress for her role - an Award that I think she will win - but that is misleading, for it is the LEAD part in this fim.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, Director Hooper delivers some VERY pretty pictures. Since he is dealing with two artists, quite a few of his compositions on the screen could be mistaken for painted pictures, absolutely a choice that was made that works quite well. But, because he does not have quite a full movie's worth of material to work with, he does have a tendency to let his camera linger or slow pan as our two leads gaze out a window to contemplate the events of these lives.<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"

","'THE DANISH GIRL': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne is up for his second Best Actor Oscar, in two years, for his portrayal of a 1920s transgender Danish artist, named Lili Elbe; a pioneer of her time (after he won last year, for 'THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING'). Alicia Vikander is nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar; for playing Lili's wife, Gerda Wegener. The film was directed by Tom Hooper (who also directed the Academy Award winning films 'LES MISERABLES' and 'THE KING'S SPEECH'), and it was scripted by Lucinda Coxon. The movie was based on the 2000 novel, of the same name; which was only loosely inspired by the actual lives, of the Danish painters it portrays. The film has been heavily criticized; for it's historical inaccuracies, and it's questionable depiction of transgender people. Judging the movie, just on its own merits (as a film), I thought it was OK.<br/><br/>The story takes place in 1920s Copenhagen. A successful landscape artist, named Einar Wegener (Redmayne), lives happily with his wife, Gerda (Vikander); who's a popular portrait painter. One day, Gerda asks Einar to sit in on a painting for her. He must pose in a dress, and women's shoes, in order to do so. This triggers feelings, that Einar has long kept buried inside; of identifying as a woman. The rest of the movie details her struggles to become one; and Gerda's fight to stay by her husband's side (during the battle).<br/><br/>I don't know what it's like, at all, to be a transgender person; so I can't speak to how properly the film portrays it. I have a friend, who is a transgender woman, who says the movie doesn't do an appropriate job, of demonstrating what that life is like (there's multiple flaws in the film, she pointed out). I also knew little about Lili Elbe, or Gerda Wegener, before seeing the movie; so I can't speak to it's historical accuracy, either (but I've read it's horribly inaccurate). I do think the film is well directed, emotionally intriguing and decently acted (although I don't think Redmayne deserved another Oscar nomination). It definitely kept my interest, throughout it's 2-hour running length; and Vikander is fantastic in it!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b_aLk3J5gh4"

The film has four nominations, and it has only a slim chance to win any of them. For Costume Design and Production Design, it seems very unlikely that the film has a chance at all. On the costume, perhaps, because they had to effectively dress am an as a woman. But this seems more like it would have fallen into hair and makeup. I suspect no win here.<br/><br/>I would love to see Best Supporting Actress for Alicia Vikander, especially because she should more properly be seen as the lead actress and not simply a supporting part of the film. In many ways, this is just as much the wife's story as it is the husband's. Vikander dominated, and although I would have to give serious thought to it, she may just have my vote. But this is one of the tougher categories this year, with Jennifer Jason Leigh (Hateful Eight) seen as a likely winner, and Rooney Mara (Carol) probably giving her best performance yet. So my heart is with Vikander, but my head says it is unlikely.<br/><br/>Which leaves Best Actor for Eddie Redmayne. He won last year portraying Stephen Hawking, and he has followed it up with something almost as good. It is one thing to put on makeup and a dress. Anyone can do that. But he transforms himself completely into Lili, and has a character that is bursting with emotion and a possible mental instability. (This may give the wrong impression for transgender people, but Lili is portrayed less as a woman inside a man and more as a split personality.) <br/><br/>Redmayne would love to win back-to-back, and in many years this would be quite possible. But all the buzz says Leonardo DiCaprio is walking away with the award for his role in ""Revenant"". Personally, I believe Redmayne put more of himself into his role than DiCaprio did. But I do not expect the forward momentum to change... this is ""Leo's year"", and when the awards get announced, expect him to be the one with the statue, not Eddie."

Eddie Redmayne, on the other hand, I do find difficult to watch on screen no matter his role. He was outstanding as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything and won a well-deserved Oscar, however in this film he's back to being quite tricky to watch, for me at least.<br/><br/>Based very loosely on the life of Einar Wegener and set in 1920's Denmark this is a largely fictional piece about the life of Einar, his wife Gerda and his journey to becoming Lili Elbe.

For this alone I'd recommend seeing the film, it's visually stunning.<br/><br/>With the actual story, there are elements of it that I found hard to watch and ultimately for me I felt more for Einar's wife Gerda which is a shame as most of their relationship is essentially fictitious. Vikander is absolutely brilliant in her role (her best to date in my opinion), immediately making you feel her side of the story and taking you along all the ups and downs of her relationship. The inclusion of Matthias Schoenaerts was an inspired selection and he brings a wonder air to the film, his fourth superb role in the last 12 months.<br/><br/>Overall I found it an OK film and have to admit to being touched towards the end, but for me the casting of Redmayne made it a little harder to watch. I'm sure others wouldn't feel the same though so don't be put off by my thoughts on that front. Well worth a watch if you enjoy how great a film can look"

"marianne-lindsell","9","0","1","5 February 2016"," Poignant
","It was certainly brave of Eddie Redmayne, and he turned in a very good performance, if slightly lacking in nuance - though that may be down to the script, and the limited time available to tell the story in a single film. For instance, we barely see anything of the lead up to the transformation, with the script concentrating far more on the aftermath. However, this is the reverse of many such biopics, and is welcome. The real star though (sorry Eddie) is Alicia Vikander, who, in Gerda, conveys a totally authentic sense of unconditional love and concern for her spouse, even up to and past the surgery. Of course the script helps, but there are very poignant moments when Alicia really makes this jump out of the screen. The ending is just too emotional to bear. The choice of the script writer to tell a fictitious love story only based on the true story, and not the true story itself, is in this case justified, as it allows a sense of poetry to emerge from the chaos of pain and beauty in this tragic tale."

"maurice_yacowar","8","0","1","19 January 2016"," In 1928 Danish painter tries surgical change into woman.
","""Are you a reporter,"" Lily's ball beau asks, ""or a poetess?"" <br/><br/>Einar's paintings are reportage, the stuff of journalism—a description of the surface appearance. So are wife Gerda's commissioned portraits. Her success as an artist comes when she goes beyond the surface and explores her husband's hidden sexuality, when she paints him as Lily. In moving from surface to depth, from the apparent to the possible, she moves from reportage to poetry. <br/><br/>Einar's landscapes point in that direction themselves. His landscape subjects provide the opening montage and the site of the film's ending, when his widow and old friend Hans visit the sites he had painted. One of Einar's recurring images is a line of thin trees standing frail atop their partial reflection in the water. In the first series a wide-reaching skeleton of a tree is completely duplicated by the water below. Those trees are an emblem of the transgender hero, with a firm material image above and a shimmering weaker one below, the male persona with a female nature submerged. Whatever Einar wears — whether in clothes or in genitalia — he dreams Lily's dreams. <br/><br/>Gerda has been subconsciously aware of her husband's feminine nature. When she first kissed him ""It was like kissing myself."" She catches his femininity when she dresses him in women's costume and when she draws him asleep. Even as she loses her husband she supports his movement toward realizing his true gender. As he says, ""I love you, because you are the only person who made sense of me. And made me, possible."" <br/><br/>His old friend Hans is similarly accepting of Einar/Lily's duality: ""I've only liked a handful of people in my life, and you've been two of them."" Though as a child Hans may have been attracted to Einar — ""Einar just looked so pretty and... I had to kiss him! So, yes, I kissed Einar."" — his nature proved heterosexual, as wee see in his embrace of Gerda, though he never married. The film delicately presents the gender fluidity our society has come quickly to accept. <br/><br/>That is proved by the easy success Tom Hooper's poetic melodrama has enjoyed. We're ready to identify with and to sympathize with transgendered characters, as we have so quickly come to accept same-sex marriages. Perhaps we're ready to embrace an actual transgendered person instead of one safely played by a good actor. We've had some transgendered performers on the TV shows Transparency and Orange is the New Black, but this film settles on a safer, more sanitized presentation. The opportunity for a harder view, a more challenging realism, is ultimately allowed to fly away —like the gossamer scarf Einar gave Gerda back."
"JPfanatic93","6","0","1","21 January 2016"," Bland but good looking period piece
","Basically this movie embodies wasted potential. There's a capable director and a number of wonderful actors, some with notable award winning accolades to their name, attached to this film, but it just doesn't manage to engage the audience. It looks great, but it doesn't feel so. If trans-genders are looking for a movie that illustrates their long plight and continuing calls for understanding and acceptance for their cause, I fear this is not it.<br/><br/>The strongest reason of its failure as such, is that it's simply too clean, too good looking. Though Eddie Redmayne looks androgynous enough to get away with playing both sexes effectively, his Einar's/Lili's long road from man to woman, though destined to end in tragedy, simply is too easy, certainly for the times we are dealing with. Yes, he's forced to leave his own country in search for a more accepting environment and yes, he's looked upon by medical minds as a freak of nature, sick in spirit and in desperate need of a gruesome cure, but the progression of the movie doesn't live up to the many decades of violent misunderstanding if not downright cruelty inflicted on trans-genders. Lili is surrounded by caring people who all too easily accept her plight and encourage her to do what she feels she should do, despite the danger this will place her in and the hardship it causes those closed to her, especially her loving wife who never signed up for this when they got married and who is finally enjoying some professional success. The scene with the physicians looking to operate on Lili with force to ""cure"" her woes is played more for laughs, though historically there's nothing funny about this sort of medicine which could be described as blatant torture. The only time Lili is physically confronted with her otherness is when she's beaten up on the street by two random hoodlums. Other than that, as trans-gender drama goes, this one is surprisingly happy.<br/><br/>But despite these shortcomings, The Danish Girl has all the hallmarks of a solid period piece. It's capably directed, just not memorably so, unlike director Tom Hooper's own The King's Speech. Costume and set design is top notch, nobody will deny. The lead actors are at the top of their game and their Oscar nominations are well deserved (though I doubt they're good enough for a win), while the supporting cast is equally up to its task. But for all intents and purposes, it's not enough. Emotionally, The Danish Girl underwhelms, thanks to a script that plays it safe and doesn't feel like shocking the audience too strongly. Maybe it feels the notion of trans-gender struggles is risqué enough as it is for audiences? That would be rather offensive to the people it means to represent, who admittedly won't feel very much represented by it anyway."
"themadmovieman","6","0","1","17 January 2016"," Incredibly disappointing
","This is an extremely disappointing film, simply because it had the potential to be something so impressive. It's not a terrible movie, and the direction, production design and one of the lead performances are all great, but it really falls short of what it's trying to accomplish time and time again: an emotionally powerful and engrossing story.<br/><br/>Before I get into that, let's start on the bright side. The best part of this film, by a long way, is how it looks. With excellent attention to detail in the sets and costumes, it's at least a really nice film to look at. Meanwhile, Tom Hooper's direction is at its best since The Damned United.<br/><br/>One thing that he does extremely well is bring the camera in really close to the actors' faces to give a clearer image of their emotions, and as such make a scene more emotionally powerful. Whilst it's arguable that he did this to an excessive extent in The King's Speech and Les Misérables, it's not overdone in The Danish Girl, and it does help to bring a little bit more emotion to the table when the story completely lacks it (I'll get onto that in a moment).<br/><br/>Now, the performances. Eddie Redmayne is the one that everyone is talking about for this film, but I didn't think he was all that great. It's not a bad performance, but I really felt he went a bit over-the-top with all of the facial tics and extreme wide-eyedness of his character, which really got on my nerves as the film went on, and consequently lessened my emotional connection to his character significantly.<br/><br/>In fact, Redmayne is completely outshone in The Danish Girl by his co-star, Alicia Vikander, who plays his wife; she is excellent. Her performance is hugely calm throughout, and because of that, I felt so much more able to empathise with and care for her character, and so the majority of the emotional impact of this film came from her, and not the main character who we're meant to really connect with.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about what makes this film such a disappointment: its extreme lack of emotional power. As the film went on, I could tell that this was really trying hard to be a proper tearjerker, and why not? It's the story of a man who begins to question everything about himself, and begins to turn his and his wife's life completely upside down.<br/><br/>However, it really doesn't work. As I said, Hooper's direction and Vikander's performance lend some degree of emotion to the film, but it still isn't impacting enough.<br/><br/>I think the major reason for this is that the film attempts to do too much too quickly. Surprisingly, this isn't that slow-moving a film, but that's unfortunately to its detriment. The whole first act is all about this man suffering extreme confusion as he begins to question who he is, and whilst that should be the focus of the whole film, it feels rushed and therefore shallow.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there are at least eleven 'moments' where something really big and influential happens in the characters' lives. Now, a few of these are fine, but when there are so may apparently integral moments, most of which come way before the finale, they really lose their power, and that's the main reason why this film ultimately just doesn't work.<br/><br/>I don't want to completely hate on The Danish Girl, because it's not an awful film, and its visuals and Vikander's performance are undoubtedly excellent. However, there was such huge potential for an emotional roller-coaster of a story here, yet it completely failed to deliver, and that's what's most disappointing."

","Eddie Redmayne is stunning in this film, as well as Alicia Vikander's performance. I enjoyed this movie and it is very touching and emotional. Redmayne's performance is captivating. He captures a woman's movements, expression and he looks beautiful--Not bad for a man. You will know when you see the film. It is wonderful that they made this film, because I did not know transgender history and hardship way back then. This film is biographical and is set in mid-1920s Copenhagen. The portrait artist Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander) asks her husband, popular landscape artist Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne), to stand in for a female model that was late to pose for a painting she is working on. In addition, the act of Einar posing as a female figure reveals his hidden gender identity as a female, named Lili Elbe, when he feels the softness of the garment, stockings and shoes. Ms. Vikander's performance is amazing as a supportive wife. I like her in Ex Machina and she does not disappoint in this film. I like to watch a movie that teaches me something new and be move by it as well. This film sure did. It is a wonderful love story. A must see!"
"neil-476","7","0","2","15 January 2016"," Food for thought - what actually matters?
","In 1920s Copenhagen, young married artists Gerda and Einar indulge in sex games where Einar adopts the identity of Lili. Things rapidly turn more serious as it transpires that Einar feels, deep inside, that Lili is his real identity, trapped in Einar's body. Gerda, as confused as Lili is, supports her as she makes her way towards her true persona in times which were not really ready to deal with that sort of issue.<br/><br/>Eddie Redmayne, as Einar/Lili, and Alicia Vikander as Gerda, are garnering praise for their performances here, and it is richly deserved: they are both deeply affecting in this adaptation of a novel which is based on real people. Redmayne adopts an androgynous physicality which makes Lili credible, and Vikander has a quality of fragile beauty intermixed with plainness which is quite unique (her English accent is also exemplary), which means that they are both physically appropriate for their roles, but the real strength of this film is in the emotional stakes.<br/><br/>I have no experience and little interest in gender confusion – or, at least, I didn't. But this film raises questions about the nature of gender and its interaction with love. There is a sequence where Ben Wishaw attempts to kiss Lili – a gay actor playing a man whose sexual orientation is unclear, attempting to kiss a straight actor playing a man masquerading as a woman whose sexual orientation, at that point, is apparently straight, and it left me enormously confused on a level I'm not familiar with. I came away with the conclusion – glib, perhaps – that people are people and, while sexual orientation is important on an individual level, maybe it's not that important in terms of absolute love.<br/><br/>There is a lot of food for thought in this film."

However what starts out as a sort of a dress up game ends up turning into an issue of identity as einar starts to become more unhappy with his male identity and seems to have a stronger come cation as his female counterpart lily, the effect also has an emotional effect o Greta who feels as though she I helpless to save her husband while trying to be supportive of his choice to become a woman, while certain parts are a little flat and pacing suffers a bit but the film itself is well done with an interesting message."

","From director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech, Les Misérables), I saw the review for this on Film 2015 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh, and having watched it I was not surprised when awards season came around that this got the attention it did. Based on the true story, in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1926, Danish portrait artist Gerda Wegener (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Alicia Vikander) is trying to find and paint a work of art to satisfy her patron. She asks her husband, popular landscape artist Einar (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Eddie Redmayne), to stand in for a female model who was late for posing for her new painting at their flat. Einar is made to wear female clothing on an occasion, then he and Gerda are invited to an event, but he has no desire to be gushed over, so they work together to dress and disguise himself as a woman, as Lili Elbe, and as his alter ego he is highly convincing. Gerda also finds her inspiration, using Einar as her subject, using his natural features, and turning them feminine, and of course he is dressed up again as a woman, these new paintings impress her patrons and she is finally recognised in a gallery unlike her works before. However this posing as a female figure changes the lifelong identification of Einar, what starts as a first tentative and then irreversible progression, Einar leaves behind his former identity and becomes Lili Elbe. This takes place as both Lili and Gerda relocate to Paris, France, there Gerda meets Einar's childhood friend now art dealer Hans Axgil (Matthias Schoenaerts), also the first boy Einar had ever kissed. Gerda and Hans become mutually attracted, but this causes problems as her relationship with Einar is changing, he is now Lili entirely in persona and identity, and having a relationship of sorts with Henrik (Skyfall's Ben Whishaw), Hans plays a supportive role for the couple. Ultimately Gerda accepts that Einar has fully changed into Lili, and in a conversation with doctor Kurt Warnekros (Sebastian Koch) they find out that he can perform a surgery to change Lili into a full woman, the first instances of male to female sex reassignment surgery. This operation is in two parts, the first to remove Lili's external genitalia, and after recovery the second to fashion a vagina, but Lili's eagerness to go ahead leads her to rush the sequence of procedures, and she eventually dies of complications from the surgery. The end of the film sees Gerda accepting the death of Lili, and her former husband Einar, she and Hans return to Denmark and go to a cliff edge, Gerda wears a scarf that Lili had given her after the second operation, it is taken away by the wind. Also starring Drive Angry's Amber Heard as Ulla, Emerald Fennell as Elsa, Henry Pettigrew as Niels, Richard Dixon as Fonnesbech, Pip Torrens as Dr. Hexler, Adrian Schiller as Rasmussen and Boy Meets Girl's Rebecca Root as Nurse. Redmayne gives a fantastically sensitive and delicate performance as the man who experiments with cross- dressing then of course dedicates himself to becoming his new female persona, and Vikander is sensational as the wife forced to let go of what was once her husband and support him in his transformation. You could argue that the film is almost entirely from the point of view of the wife of the man turning into a woman, but the ultimate point of this film is to explore the complexities that come with gender reassignment, this was one of the first in history, it is a little fabricated in what you can and can't see, but there is no doubt of its emotional power, a great biographical drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Costume Design Paco Delgado and Best Production Design, it was nominated the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Costume Design and Best Makeup and Hair, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Alexandre Desplat. Very good!"

Let me go through some points on why I think this film is good:<br/><br/>Performances: The performances in this film were exceptional and might I even say Oscar-worthy, when the film you don't see them even stutter a single and it looks they understood their roles very. Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander's performances were the ones that shone the brightest.<br/><br/>Scripting: This is a minor point the script was good but it could have been better there were few missing lines I felt and a plot hole, wasn't big but but you know it's there but other than that pretty good.<br/><br/>Costume Design: The costume design really set the tone for the film the costumes were made as if taken from the 1920s. It's as if I felt like I was in the 1920s (specifically 1926) the costume designer made for the clothing.<br/><br/>All in all I think this is a really good and well performed period drama that could really make an impact at the awards this year. 8/10 a must watch.<br/><br/>* Best performance by a leading Actor, Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything, 2014), ** Best performance by a leading actress, Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl, 2015)."

","I love true stories, and this one is one of the most important true stories ever. Its current, its complex, its huge. So did the film match the importance of the story and give its heroes Gerda and Einar Wegener (and many others) a deserving honor as big as they were? Well i think that yes, in some ways. But its a flawed homage with quite a few big problems.<br/><br/>The biggest one is the fact that there's no insight, no introspective, the writer and the director seem to assume all the time that you know whats in the characters heads, their reasons and so... and its their reasons that it's also a big problem. You might get the feeling that this film is like a mini series of 6 hours turned into a 2 hour film. And for the most part what you get its the bigger scenes, which are the conclusions to many chapters of this characters lives. They all are huge conclusions thats for sure, but the lack of the path to said conclusions hurts the film and your feelings about it. You see the characters actions, but rarely do you see them discussing their reasons, fears, everything, until they actually do something, in a satisfying way.<br/><br/>And many scenes are too objective, this is specially obvious in the third act, that seems too rushed, barely touching on the surgery and the characters thoughts. And this also makes the film lack in emotional heft. I noticed especially at the end, where the film didn't have the emotional impact on me i expected. If one thing describes this film is to the point.The 2h really fly.<br/><br/>But films are subjective, as they should be, and so you can't argue emotions with logic. You can admit and recognize facts, as this part is bad or good... but if you feel the film is perfect to you or you loved it deep down, the facts, the problems, wont matter much or nothing at all. And this goes the other way around when you hate or dislike. Which is something that most people today refuse to understand, as they declare war against those who loved something they hated or hated something they loved.<br/><br/>And this is what happened with me, as i think this problems are hugely mitigated by 3 things, Eddie Redmayne. Alicia Vikander and the amazing production vales. <br/><br/>The two main leads are so great you just want to cover them with Oscars, and all kinds of awards. There's great performances that you love and then there's performances like this, that leaves you in awe the entire film, wondering how someone can give performances like this. Eddie Redmayne deservedly won the Oscar last year, and no matter how brilliant he is here he wont win, thanks to Leonardo Dicaprio, who is long overdue, which is to say the least, But Alicia Vikander might have a small shot at winning. Its unlikely thanks do Brie Larson and Saoirse Ronan, but who knows? <br/><br/>Eddie R. and Alicia V. are the true homage to the heroes of the story, accompanied by an amazing supporting cast, while the film itself might not reach the heights it could have, the actors more than compensate this, elevating the film to another level, one it possibly couldn't reach without them.<br/><br/>When the screenplay fails to have insight, thoughts, dialogue or scenes necessary to feel in the gaps of the story, the actors compensate with their performances, with their meticulous expressions and especially the film is very objective so there's not the emotional heft it should or could have, they are ones that bring the emotional heft, they are the one that makes you feel the mentions the film fails to evoke.<br/><br/>And of course the production values are brilliant, especially the amazing cinematography and production design, that create an amazing imagery and atmosphere, along with another epic score from Alexandre Desplat that reads the story superbly. <br/><br/>So once again this is a flawed film yes, it fails to achieve what it could have but to me the flaws are hugely mitigated by Eddie, Alicia and the quality of the production and what matters is that this story was told, and the heroes represented. Watch the film, because it really deserves, and i hope you can go beyond the flaws and focus on the grander picture as i did."

Through modelling, he discovers that he is a woman deep inside. Einar Wegener and his wife both go through much emotions and struggles to get to a point where love and integrity triumphs. The story is very touching, but for some reason I do not feel as empathic or sympathetic towards Lili. Maybe it is because of Eddie Redmayne's omnipresent big smiles which look rather fake and overdone at times. It appears that he wears a big smile most of the time and also tilt his head downwards to give a more feminine presence, but to be honest he already looks very feminine without these two mannerisms. I am impressed by Eddie Redmayne, he looks very feminine (sometimes even more feminine than Alicia Vikander!) but the big smile is just over the top.<br/><br/>Overall, I am touched by the story.

A more immersive perspective during Lily's visits to several certified doctors with armchair diagnostics would have added the desired ounce of energy absent in the rushed montage effect, and never really delving into the apparent hopelessness of a male wanting to abandon his gender privileges in the 1920s. And although the conclusion was perhaps a tad too sappy, maintaining a positive outlook could help ensure films of transgender issues maintain an important longevity in Hollywood's shrinkingly phallic hills.<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2016/01/07/the-danish-girl-review-indie-adam/"
"troyputland","7","0","3","7 January 2016"," Redmayne and Vikander, the Oscar contenders.
","Tom Hooper is the master at covering either very grand or very taboo subjects. The Danish Girl is his most daring project yet. I'll admit I went in to this screening mildly narrow minded, and left more open to a matter I clearly know nothing about. Eddie Redmayne, who won the Oscar for The Theory of Everything last year, looks like a contender again this year for his transitional role. At first it's the mere touch of women's clothing that alerts his feelings, but that soon turns to dressing up and being someone, that in his mind, he knows he is: a woman named Lili. Although Redmayne's acting is tremendous, an award is more deserving of Alicia Vikander, who plays Redmayne's wife. The Danish Girl shows just as much her anguish, and acceptance, and the effect it has on their marriage, as it does Einar's/Lily's. The daring subject of this film may not be for everyone, but it'll certainly touch the hearts of those who do see it."
"davidgee","7","0","1","6 January 2016"," Eddie Redmayne plays Garbo
","I found this a touching movie to sit through yesterday, but upon reflection today it's harder to take it quite as seriously as it takes itself. The early cross-dressing scenes have much of the charm of a Mozart opera,but during the many mirror-gazing scenes leading up to Eddie Redmayne's sex-change surgery, I began thinking of Greta Garbo, to whom the cameramen of her day also gave long moments of soulful introspection.<br/><br/>Ben Whishaw also has an androgynous beauty; was he in the running for the lead role? Alicia Vikander's transition from wife to best friend, well played, is perhaps over-romanticised. Tom Hooper's 2010 Oscar/Bafta-winner THE KING'S SPEECH had the added charm of humanising our lofty Royals. In THE DANISH GIRL he's trying to do the opposite, to 'mystify' a pair of artistic misfits, and he succeeds, but less fluently. <br/><br/>The cinematography is superb, creating harbour-scapes of Copenhagen that have the luminosity of Turner paintings. The film is only a little too long, a little too slow and maybe tries a little to hard to wring our heartstrings. But wring them it does."
"rooee","7","0","3","6 January 2016"," Sexuality and the City
","In his 2000 book, David Ebershoff never set out to write the definitive biography of Lili Elbe (born Einar Wegener) and likewise this film doesn't parade a ""True Story"" claim at the start. What we get is a fictionalised account of one of the first individuals to receive gender reassignment surgery, in 1930.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Einar's transition and its effects on his marriage to the portrait painter Gerda Gottlieb (Alicia Vikander). The woman Einar wants to be, named Lili, is the third person in the relationship, causing complex jealousy and resentment. Surgery seems like the only option to remove the ambiguity and confusion in their relationship – although Lili also risks losing her life.<br/><br/>It might have awards-bait written all over it but it's not the ""issue"" movie the trailer would have us believe. Or, at least the issue isn't political or sociological, it's psychological and philosophical. In its strongest moments The Danish Girl –explores identity in unusual depth and with unusual conviction. Fiction, here, liberates a greater truth.<br/><br/>Redmayne's performance occasionally strays into the realm of mannered and affected but it also shows us a complex vulnerability which confidently elicits as much frustration as sympathy. It's another physical transformation, arguably more challenging than his Stephen Hawking. Redmayne is portraying a person who's man in body and woman in spirit. In The Theory of Everything the actor's challenge was to portray disability; here, the challenge is on the audience, to empathise with someone who believes their perfectly able body is wrong.<br/><br/>For me, Vikander is the real star here. She's strong yet heartbreaking in the impossible role of Einar's wife. What will she ultimately become when Einar is replaced by Lili? I'm not sure she even knows. As with Ex Machina, Vikander has a rare poise: an ability to command the screen with silence and stillness. It's the opposite of Redmayne's restless turn.<br/><br/>The script mostly lands. Some lines sound like they were written to be quoted rather than to be spoken – ""You made me possible"" – but these spare words do get to the heart of things. And what heart this film has. Its triumph isn't only in putting a transgender person front-and-centre without pathologising their condition; it is in allowing us to see sensitivity and gentleness in men without assuming homosexuality.<br/><br/>Alexandre Desplat's score is a bit soppy, its rolling river piano mimicking Michael Nyman in the blandest way, but it can't spoil the craft within the frame. Director Tom Hooper throws in some familiar elements: that hyper-real theatre set aesthetic we've seen in John Adams and Les Miserables, and those extreme close-ups which would be warts-and-all were we not looking at exquisite movie stars.<br/><br/>As Lili moves closer to her actualisation, her world is bedecked in the light and colour of Paris, before moving into nature, into truth. In the end we get an outrageous Movie Moment but against the odds it works, and you're weeping. And you reflect and realise that you've just seen a quiet landmark of a movie."
"ignition1377","10","0","7","6 January 2016"," Beautiful Movie Superb acting
","Watched with daughter after reading a short summary of Lili and Gerda. Amazing . This movie captivates the light and atmosphere of a time where post impressionism painted life as the movie depicts throughout its incredibly beautiful scenes, clothes and landscape shots. I could see through Renoir and Degas works as well as Klint. Lili's character story is portrayed in a delicate manner, showing enough detail for the viewer to understand the difficulties of two individuals with more avant garde than some people today . fortunately for the pair , they lived among the wealthy and arty crowd that could tolerate such scandal . The movie is a reminder of our limited attitudes to gender diversity which by the way , have only been endorsed in the Western world for less than a century. It tells a story of two people that truly loved each other and although trapped on the wrong time, they opened the path for many to freedom."
"laura_macleod","Null","0","5","5 January 2016"," Beautiful evocative and special
","Most people cannot appreciate beauty anymore. This film deserves NO criticism; it is beautiful on all levels. Nothing is perfect hence a 9. The central performances are astoundingly good. The cinematography/sets/costumes/ etc etc are perfection. Now to the story - listening and reading the critics I expected to be disappointed; you know the types - they either need some kind of special effects to blow the mind or some kind of twisted dark story to get the positives going - but this film is subtle, opens the mind to new possibilities of human experience and the pain and the joy of life. Who would ever think to remember a Danish man from long ago, who was a trans-gender. A man who was talented and sensitive; full of love yet living in a world where such things as trans-gender were considered mental illness. Who would have imagined his beautiful and talented wife, who was a person of immense loyalty and love. Who would imagine their story? It is so interesting to take the journey of this film. A wonderful film."
"pamma09","9","0","5","5 January 2016"," Well told
","This true story is not for everyone - some will never get the struggle that a person like the main character goes through. And they could learn but the their own misunderstanding would keep that from happening. This takes place in the 1920's - both the main characters are artists and they truly love each other. Alisha Vikinder is amazing as the wife- her acceptance of her husbands condition is so well shown, her love for him and willingness to help is so evident, and then her frustrations with the course things take. Hers is an amazing performance. Eddie Redmayne is an actor who is willing to take chances and he took one with this role - he is amazing and so believable. I'm sure an Oscar nomination is coming his way - again. I recommend it for anyone with an open mind - it is a story well told."
"simnmr","8","0","5","5 January 2016"," True Story of a courageous pioneer!
","I've just finished to watch ""the danish girl"", a really good movie, and for good I mean well done and with a great story behind, a quite original true story. The story of two artist Gerda Wegener and Einar M.A. Wegener, later Lili Elbe the first transgender woman. In the movie we are introduced to the transformation of Einar in Lili helped by the lovely and strong Gerda. A change conditioned by the limit of our social customs, our psychological knowledge and our medicine. This last probably put the word end to a tragic and lonely existence. Nevertheless, this fragile and complicated life opened a new world that had given relief and it is still giving hope to many persons. Whether you consider or not despicable the hard decision of changing sex, anyway I still think all the human beings deserve a true feeling of empathy for the melancholy and sadness of our lives. Loneliness, incompatibility, rejection and friendship, this movie will touch your heart in many different ways."
"vicentesobral","9","0","5","5 January 2016"," Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander's show in an awesome movie!
","This movie talks about a very sensitive topic, uncomfortable, sometimes. The movie is technically well made, with a great direction (Tom Hooper) and soundtrack (Alexander Desplat: one of my favorite soundtrack composers), giving us a few key images of Denmark (about the sky, the streets...).<br/><br/>The contextualization is interesting, and the plot is controversial but magnificent, with the power of being based in true events.<br/><br/>But mostly, what makes this movie one of the best movies of 2015 are the performances: so delightful, so good!Eddie Redmayne gave (in my opinion) his best performance ever, as Lily Wegener (and also as Einar). He showed us his feelings, he was transparent and brilliant. <br/><br/>Alicia Vikander, as previously showed in Ex Machina, has a lot of potential: she's pretty, her voice is softly and she acted awesomely as Gerda, explaining her concerns and fears to us. Brilliant.<br/><br/>So, what I really want you to do is: f*** IMDb ratings, f*** this homophobic people and go and see this great movie. Wait and watch the Oscars too.<br/><br/>This was a year of great movies, and this one was certainly in my TOP 10. Go and see it."

","This movie was incredible. It grabbed my heart and I felt what it must be like to always wish you were the other gender. The roadblock to happiness. Eddie Redmayne was lilli. His natural moves were feminine, I was completely in awe of his acting ability. I was crying inconsolably at the last 15 minutes of the movie. I s the first time since n a long time that I actually was taken into Lilli's world. His wife was so<br/><br/>in love with him.and she was brilliant in her support of her husband. I cried for Gerda, Lilly, and for Everyman who had to hide their feelings and exist in this homophobic world. My uncle was murdered in 1962. He was gay and he was bashed to death by a couple of punks he was 41 years old. And I cried for him. I cried because the shame of his being gay overshadowed the love that his family had for him. How twisted. His life partner was ignored, not invited to the service. That was so wrong. All of it was wrong. I love the people that I love for all their perfection and shortcomings. If they choose a same sex relationship, it is their choice. Not mine. What difference does it make. If he had been accepted for his gayness he would have Had a chance to find happiness.<br/><br/>i believe the movie changed my life."
"swilliky","7","0","3","31 December 2015"," Redmayne proves he is a great actor, Vikander is amazing as well
","Eddie Redmayne continues to prove he is one of the best actors of this generation. His performance as Lili Elbe will put him once again in the running for Best Actor. Redmayne conveys the confusion and determination of Elbe with grace and this brave woman's courage is shown through the actor. This true story is important to the current times, and I thought it was very inspiring and enlightening. The struggle of Lili to find her place in the world was portrayed with emotion and grace.<br/><br/>Alicia Vikander continues to have a break out year following her roles as a lifelike robot in Ex Machina and a brilliant mechanic in The Man from U.N.C.L.E.. Gerda Wegener had to face the reality that her husband was no longer there and had been replaced by the woman she truly felt she was, Lili. Vikander has tears in her eyes in nearly every scene once Lili begins her transformation. She brought true emotional depth to the loyal woman who continued to love her husband not matter what. I think Alicia Vikander will get a nomination and continue to produce great characters in her bright future.<br/><br/>See more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
"nathaliegundersen","6","0","2","31 December 2015"," Average movie
","Was looking forward to this movie due to Matthias Schoenaerts being in it. He was in it for about 10 minutes, looking mighty fine and as usually amazing acting. I watched the movie for free but still felt cheated as I thought he had a larger role.A bit like Ryan Gosling dying in the 10 first minutes of ""a place upon the pine""....so if you going to watch it because of Matthias then I am warning you he ain't in it !All you stuck with is a guy that like to dress like a woman.It would have been much more interesting to see more of the lovely handsome hot as f. Matthias.Besides this disappointment i did enjoy the movie and I though the acting was good, but I will never bother to watch it again and I wouldn't have gone to the cinema to watch it.I don't think it lived up to the hype.The actress that played the wife I thought she was perfect for the role and she did very well, same with the dude that played the girl."
"nicoletje_kd","9","0","4","30 December 2015"," A story that will change the lives of a lot of people
","The danish girl is a perfect example of a film that will change the lives of a lot of people. The story about a woman living in a mans body is beautifully focused on the storyline rather than shots that will draw you attention away. The acting is marvelous. The way the actors play with the difference between a man and a woman is extraordinary and with so much thought. The story itself is a beautiful getaway from daily life in which we have to live with prejudgment and some failing to understand we differ from one another. Don't get me wrong. Of course the story is a bit romanticized in the way that the big problem isn't the outside world, but rather the struggle within that drives the story. The screenwriter has done an amazing job by dialogue and detail to give the viewer a clear perspective of the story behind. <br/><br/>It is the detail and the brilliant performance that made me feel for and with the characters. I want to ask you to sit down, be quiet and give yourself the focus to live the life of someone with such great power and strength.<br/><br/>Be inspired, be free, be you!"
"skalwani","7","0","2","29 December 2015"," Portrait of a very difficult to understand subject
","The movie - based on the book ""Man Into Woman"", a diary kept by one of the first person to go thru a trans-gender experience, dictate the pace of the whole movie. Both Alicia and Eddie give excellent performances, bringing to the surface their emotions and tragic gut wrenching journey of their feelings. It does however capture the essence of the times (1920s Europe) of how society viewed this and the utter lack of knowledge of the medical establishment at the time. I did not expect much from the movie and was pleasantly surprised by the crisp editing, transitions, and attention paid to era details. <br/><br/>Worth a watch just to appreciate the tough times in the early days. The movie does have good closure towards the end, even if it is a bit tragic."
"tyraskyles","8","0","4","26 December 2015"," The Danish Girl is a guide to the saved soul
","The Danish Girl is not just a simple story of a man who wants to be a woman. It is a shocking story.<br/><br/>It is not a pleasant movie in terms of making you laugh, but it can teach you a lot of lessons.<br/><br/>It is about people who don't know themselves and suddenly something happens in their life and they want to change forever.<br/><br/>That is what happened to Einar (Eddie Redmayne). In his case, a game led him to the most serious thing: to realize what his dream identity is.<br/><br/>It cannot be by luck that this man was an artist, a painter, inasmuch art is a method of self-searching in the soul and the mind. Einar hadn't acknowledged that he missed something and he found it through a joke.<br/><br/>Einar wants to be loved for Lilly, not Einar who just disguises in Lilly. The sadness of a person who seeks to find his own identity is extremely revealed in the movie.<br/><br/>He is trying to prove that he is not insane, just different from other people. He wants to be something else from what he was born and he has the right, but bullying towards him is inevitable.<br/><br/>The doctors all want to cure him, even lock him in a psychiatric hospital, but Einar knows he is not for that.<br/><br/>His girlfriend, Gerda, loves him and wants to help him, so she is to blame a lot for Einar's condition, as she kind of pushed him into that. She even used him to produce exceptional paintings, which showed his female part of him. Perhaps, that was her sin. Einar's wish to become a woman may even reveal a vacuum in their relationship. Maybe he is too identified with his girlfriend.<br/><br/>Most people will mock Einar for transforming into Lilly, but a lot of other people will be able to see beyond that: to see his soul and what his soul needs to be healed.<br/><br/>I don't think that Einar likes men and that is the reason he wants to be a woman. He wants to be a woman because he admires women regardless of his sexual orientation as of what kind of people he wants around him. Einar lets a woman be born in him and he battles through two different sexes. So, he is confused and doesn't know who of the two selves to keep. Apart from the war he has inside of him, he has the war of the other people who can't understand him and follow stereotypes. Even already having a woman's soul, Einar does want to become a woman in display in order people to know him as a woman.<br/><br/>It is strange that his girlfriend didn't leave him, but stayed with him and believed also that Einar is not a man but a woman. It is a sign of braveness, but also, through a different perspective, a false behaving towards a sick person.<br/><br/>Of course, what Einar passed through might be only an illusion, a transient mood. Sometimes, people believe some things and after a period of time not, so it is kind of strange that Einar took the decision quite early. He was confident too early. He might have better waited to see whether it was just a moment of madness. I didn't like the end. It was too sad. If Einar had escaped this momentum, maybe he wouldn't want to become a woman, but that we will never know it.<br/><br/>The film speaks about things that shock the community: people who want to change sex, people who want people of the same sex, love triangles.<br/><br/>But in life only matters what makes us happy, whatever it is and whatever the other people would say about that.<br/><br/>In this case, the coincidence is never a coincidence, as it helps you find what you want in life.<br/><br/>The movie reminds us how cruel it can be to ""dare"" to have a dream of being something so abnormal for the community.<br/><br/>The film also teaches us that the image can be a fallacy, so, the soul counts. When a man sees a woman becomes attracted to her. He doesn't know if she is really a woman or a man who just disguises into a woman.<br/><br/>The film keeps the interest even of the people who are not much interested in the story as a first read of the plot.<br/><br/>Its success lies upon that it presents everything in intense. The feelings of the two protagonists are very strong and this makes this movie very touching.<br/><br/>It is a journey to find who you really are and what you really want in life."
